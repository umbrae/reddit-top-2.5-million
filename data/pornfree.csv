1363882076.0,232,self.pornfree,1aqlg3,"I don't look at porn.  I made one change.

I wasn't always like this.  Fifty days ago I was watching porn, the same as most of the other people here.  Afterwards, like most people, I got disappointed in myself.  I realized I needed to quit watching porn.  

You all know how this goes.  Shortly afterward, you're doing it again.  Nothing changes.

This time, rather than swearing to never surf again (hah) or installing yet another web blocker (sudo useradd -D newuser ; su newuser -c firefox), I did something different.

I didn't say ""I don't look at porn anymore"".  I didn't say ""I can't look at porn.""  I didn't say ""I'm not going to look at porn.""

I decided **I don't look at porn.**

Notice the language there.  

 * I am six feet one inch tall.  
 * I have brown hair.  
 * I don't look at porn.  
 * I have a small scar on my left hip.  

These are not resolutions to be made and broken, they are defining characteristics of who I am.  What's interesting is that the way you define yourself automatically guides your actions.  

Imagine having a friend send you a porn link and telling them ""Thanks, but I don't look at porn"".  *Wouldn't that be awesome*?  It's really not hard. 

You already define who you are by your actions.  Now, define your actions by who you are.",,False,,t5_2rglh,False,,week1,True,t3_1aqlg3,http://www.reddit.com/r/pornfree/comments/1aqlg3/i_dont_look_at_porn_i_made_one_change_took_me/,

I remember when it was an underground grassroots movement, and now I see it has grown and spread. I don't want to share any of my personal information, but my reasons for being in the industry were very close to what this girl says: http://www.reddit.com/r/pornfree/comments/ssp20/how_porn_affects_me_the_girl/

Many of us feel compelled to sexualize ourselves, even without pay, because we can't deal with the pornified culture we live in. Many of us have been abused as well, and have committed suicide due to PTSD from being in porn, prostituting ourselves (porn is really not so much different, and many girls who do pornography are also ""escorts"") and becoming strippers.

Even before I ever started working in this, and getting paid for sex, I hated pornography, I hated strip clubs, I hated all of it. But if you didn't like it you just had to suck it up and deal with it. Sometimes living in masturbatory, sexless relationships with your boyfriend because he has left you for his hand and a series of images. It doesn't matter how good looking your are, and I hope the girl who wrote that understands this.

People will approach me and say well what about Youporn and places like r/gonewild?

Sexual exploitation is so pervasive, it is so engulfed in our society women are just throwing themselves into the camera. Let us not forget what it does to men, just look at the amazing things happening to the guys in /r/nofap. If you watch the Ted Talks link it shows how men are reclaiming their masculinity by not being slaves to this.

This went on longer than I intended and it wasn't meant to shame anyone. I just read that link and my heart went out to that girl, and I just wanted to say I was once her and that was part of my reasoning for becoming a piece of meat because if you can't beat 'em, join 'em.

If you have any questions for me I'd be happy to answer, this is sort of a throw-away account but I just wanted to say bravo and keep up the good work. You will give girls that have not yet submitted to their depression about this hope. And you are making yourself better people.

But here's some tips my therapist has given me that I find helpful, and maybe you will, too.

**When you're tempted, don't turn it into an internal debate.** - This just makes it easier for the addiction to win, because you're just forcing yourself to think about it more. Instead acknowledge that you have an urge to look at porn, and move on to something else. Say it aloud ""I realize that I want to look at porn, and instead I'm going to [read a book, go for a walk, play a game, call a friend, etc.]"" and then follow through.

**Don't try to avoid the addiction** - Avoiding it just means you've got to deal with it later. Deal with it as soon as you feel it coming on with the above method or whatever works for you. Ignoring it or keeping yourself busy only means it's going to strike that much harder when you've run out of things to do, and you'll have that much less practice dealing with it.

**Don't become afraid of boredom** - One of the reasons I hear a lot that people relapse is due to boredom. This can lead to a fear of boredom, which in turn can lead to you trying to avoid boredom at all costs and therefor trying to keep yourself busy with other things (as said above). When you're bored, embrace it. Sit with it. Learn to enjoy the time that you have nothing to do. In such a fast-paced world you should be thankful for the free time you find yourself having.

**When planning your day, instead of thinking ""I'm going to avoid porn,"" think ""I'm going to achieve ___""** - Thinking about avoiding porn is just another way of thinking about porn. Instead of imagining your schedule as a negative thing full of potential triggers and landmines, set a goal for yourself -- something you won't regret immediately after you're finished. Something that makes you feel good, instead. Focus on that goal instead of the idea of avoiding porn. ""I'm going to clean the bathroom to surprise my wife/family, because I know it will make them proud and myself feel accomplished.""

I haven't been the most active person on this subreddit, but I've tried to offer occasional words of encouragement or assist in hard decision-making. Now, I've decided that it's time for me to unsubscribe, but before doing that I wanted to introduce myself and offer some last bits of encouragement.

I am 25/f, and I am divorced. My ex-husband was a porn addict. We went through years of the usual routine. First, ""I don't have a problem."" Then ""Fuck you for calling it a problem."" Then, ""Okay, I do have a problem and I'll fix it."" But he failed. He didn't change his habits, and they got worse. In the end I had to leave.

After I left, I discovered that the years of dealing with his behavior and the repression of my own feelings while trying to help him had left me with a very severe aversion to porn, especially its use while in a relationship. I have panic attacks and become physically ill when confronted with a partner using porn, and fall back into the panic and total despair from that past relationship with an addict: A partner who excessively uses porn will destroy their sex life, sacrifice the quality of their relationship, and willingly cause their partner discomfort or pain with their behavior without a second thought. I was young, conventionally attractive, and had a higher sex drive than that partner, but he stuck to the computer screen instead. And he lost me.

My current S.O and I have discussed this at great length. He has decided to try going porn-free. And I have decided that I need to cut the subject out of my life. Watching other people struggle with this can be hard on my own mental state. But before I go, I wanted to say a few things to all of you who are making this heroic effort.

You are all amazing. What you are doing is difficult, but totally possible. You CAN re-wire your brain, you DO have the self-discipline to get through the initial rough patch, and you WILL be better off for it. Your partners, or future partners, will appreciate it. Congratulations to you all for your successes, and my best wishes in all of your struggles.

While my badge shows just under a month-- and I am plenty proud of that, believe me!-- I have actually only looked at porn once in the last two months, and that's a rare success in my history. Point being: I am starting to identify more with a porn-free daily existence. 

I had insomnia the second half of last night. Wandering downstairs, I put on an educational podcast, reorganized my phone screens, added all the assignments for an upcoming class to my calendar, did a scalp treatment and learned to use some new, promising productivity apps.

Suddenly, even though it's not dawn yet, I hear footsteps above my head. And I realize, ironically, how all this will look to my wife. She will hear the click click click of the touchpad on my laptop, and it will sound like I am skipping through porn images. She will see me clutching my phone on the couch, and she will have NO CHOICE after all the training I've imposed upon her, but to assume I was watching a porn video.

It was wonderful to be able to accomplish so many small-but-important tasks in the hours I would've normally wasted staring Gollum-eyed at flesh pixels. And it was TEN TIMES MORE wonderful, in that moment I heard my wife swing out of bed, to realize that I had nothing to be nervous about for once.

But of course, writing this post makes me also realize just how much hurt I have thrown upon her over the years with my addiction. I have no right to any righteous joy; I can't say, ""see!

there is no such thing as intimacy. sex is purely physical and carries o emotions
5. Everyone cheats.

I know the most active people in the subreddit are people who are just starting out or who keep starting over.

I wanted to let those of you who are just taking up this commitment or are struggling to keep it going, I want you to know that this process is difficult for everyone. There are so many people out there who hate being addicted to pornography, but will never have the courage to try to get free of it because they see it as an impossible task, especially in today's world.

So, just the act of TRYING means you are on the right path.

I also wanted to assure you that EVERYBODY relapses, and most relapse a lot, before you hit your stride.

I've been involved with a local group of men trying to beat this, and every single one of us has had to ""reset our badges"" a bunch of times. It took me seven restarts before I made it this far. One of those times, I had even made it an entire year, and then on day 366, I messed it all up.

The key is persistence. Don't let a slip-up drag you down. Just immediately get back up, dust off, and get back in the game.

I've even found a lot of help by applying the 12 steps to my addiction (of course, this is for the ""addicted,"" not necessarily for those of you for whom porn is just a small bad habit, though, you never know, it might help you too).

I just wanted you all to know, it CAN be done, it is NOT hopeless, and relapse is just a part of the PROCESS!

I wish the best for each of you!",,False,,t5_2rglh,False,,year1,True,t3_19v53g,http://www.reddit.com/r/pornfree/comments/19v53g/1000_days_the_lesson_ive_learned/,

Seems kind of slow here so I'd thought I'd share my thoughts/story, I'll try not to wall of text.


  I've been married for about 4 years although I am only 23. I have been masturbating to porn regularly since I was about 14 years old, much to my wife's dismay. I went through pretty much all of my teenage years with the mindset that porn could not be harmful and that everything was a-ok and the only problems were in my wife's head.


  To make a long story short, after many years of fighting and self-reflection I have come to revise my view of pornography. First and foremost, regardless of what I think (or used to think), it's obvious that porn use hurts my wife. It makes her feel less attractive and lowers her self-esteem. I have realized porn is just not worth losing my wife. No matter how much I try to justify it.


  Secondly, there is a noticeable difference between when I watch porn daily and when I am able to abstain, even for a week. I get more sensitive and sex with my wife only gets better and better the longer I go without. I can feel more connected with her, and because I feel less guilty, I am less likley to be distant or depressed.
 

 Finally, my wife is beautiful, like literally she could be a model. She is a few years younger then me and almost everywhere we go she can turn heads. She also has a very high sex drive, and has almost never turned me down. So what purpose could porn possibly serve?


 I feel like this post is already longer than I wanted it to be, but this seems like a supportive place and it's nice that a sub-reddit exists that isn't always pushing the ""Everyone watches porn it's so normal, nothing is bad about it at all."" mentality that thrives on reddit. (see the front page submission ""Do all men watch porn?"" for a pristine example). 

*edit: Wow, hadn't realized it's been three weeks already! no relapses so far! Sex with the wife lately has been mind-blowing. Definitely have had urges, but have been able to get through them so far.

Mine is a 400 pound balding man with a ponytail, a crustache, and Dorito stained fingers who spends all of his time in his mother's basement eating and masturbating, only stopping to wipe the crumbs off his man titties.

These visuals we have make it harder to come to terms with our addiction, so I thought it might be helpful to put a real face to a fellow porn addict.

Guys. I started pornfreee like 3 or 4 (actually much, much more) times and I finally figured it out.

So Im talking to you, stranger. Im gonna give the best advices which you can get here. They would help you to keep your first nofap program, or simply save your time and motivation by not starting it at This moment.

Now here we go.

&gt;1 - **Don't start if you are not a social person at this moment.** 

This is the MOST important point. Don't fool yourself. YOU WON'T keep pornfree like without motivation. You won't keep it because you need some new drug - a girlfriend. Don't believe anything people say here, you can't live without this, but you can replace it. I know you are probably sitting at home now, procrastinating whole days. But man, this is not the thing you can handle sitting at home. Just don't start, because two weeks won't give you result. I failed at 45th day because of this. Once I just asked my self ""why the hell I am doing this if Im not gonna get a gf with this lifestyle"". And thats how I ruined all my weeks which were hard as fuck. So DON'T start if you are currenly not doing anything in your life. This is a passive challenge which makes your social life better. You won't need a wheel if you don't drive a car.

Pornfree doesn't change your lifestyle, it just makes you feel better.

*Whats the best thing to do right now if you are the guy? Masturbating once a week is the best option. Scientifically proven, that testosterone levels rise to 150% (or about so) after 1 week without masturbation. You won't feel so bad about losing a week challenge, keep your motivation high, keep your testosterone levels high (get a beard or something) and feel stronger with it.*
&gt;2 - **BLOCK ALL THE PORN SITES AND SITES WHICH CONTAIN NUDITY/HOT CHICKS**

This is extremely important. The less you tease yourself - the stronger you feel. And no, there are No other ways.

I recommend blocking it via *hosts* file, which blocks all the links you put there.

&gt;3 - **You have to keep your activity level really high / Keep yourself tired** 

That is extremely important to sleep well. If you are not tired at the end of the day - run or make some easy pushups using your knees (not feet). The more you make - the better. The aim here is to make heart tired (not muscles) and have some nice sleeping session as a result.

&gt;4 - **Don't be an owl**

The more you keep yourself awake at night using computer, the worse your motivation works. Its so easy to lose at night. Oh HOW MANY TIMES I had to startover because of this love to lurk at night.

&gt;5 - **(skinny guys) Keep your stomach full**

If you are skinny like me - eat a lot and exercise. Eating makes me forget about fap completely. And I eat every 1-3 hours right now.

&gt;6 - **Fast showers** 

Do them quick like you are in army. It takes 3-5 minutes in best case. Just wash it all and you won't get a desire to touch yourself. Remember about the task - making it within 5 minutes.

&gt;7 - **Read books**

Reading books was a really new thing for me. I literally spent 3 days reading one great adventure book and I forgot about fap completely while focusing on my eyes and brain. I forgot that I've got a human body at all. So for 3 days I forgot about fap completely.

Here's one gem Uncle Bob reposted from a Guardian Q&amp;A with writer **Alain de Botton**:

""It is perhaps only people who haven't felt the full power of sex over their logical selves who can remain uncensorious and liberally 'modern' on the subject. Philosophies of sexual liberation appeal mostly to people who don't have anything too destructive or weird that that they wish to do once they have been liberated.
However, anyone who has experienced the power of sex in general and internet pornography in particular to reroute our priorities is unlikely to be so sanguine about liberty. Pornography, like alcohol and drugs, weakens our ability to endure the kinds of suffering that are necessary for us to direct our lives properly. In particular, it reduces our capacity to tolerate those two ambiguous goods, anxiety and boredom. Our anxious moods are genuine but confused signals that something is amiss, and so they need to be listened to and patiently interpreted – which is unlikely to happen when we have to hand one of the most powerful tools of distraction ever invented. The entire internet is in a sense pornographic, it is a deliverer of constant excitement which we have no innate capacity to resist, a system which leads us down paths many of which have nothing to do with our real needs. Furthermore, pornography weakens our tolerance for the kind of boredom which is vital to give our minds the space in which good ideas can emerge, the sort of creative boredom we experience in a bath or on a long train journey. It is at moments when we feel an irresistible desire to escape from ourselves that we can be sure that there is something important we need to bring to consciousness – and yet it is precisely at such pregnant moments that internet pornography has a habit of exerting its maddening pull, thereby helping us to destroy our future.""",,False,,t5_2rglh,False,,month1,True,t3_1716sw,http://www.reddit.com/r/pornfree/comments/1716sw/alain_de_botton_on_the_maddening_pull_of_internet/,

This time, I've decided to give up porn for **me**.  I may have ED forever, I may lose my wife, I will fall behind on deadlines, I may continue to go to movies/events alone or whatever.  But what I don't want is to spend what's left of my existence in front of the computer masturbating.

*written for r/pornfree*

    When even my grandmother would call her a whore,
    I think it’s safe to use a word I abhor,
    I invited her into my life that’s for sure,
    Take a seat, and listen, ‘bout the whore at my door.

    It’s now eight thirty four,
    My family have all just left for the store,
    And although I told her we’re finished, we’re through, we’re no more,
    There’s pleading, pounding, and begging from the whore at my door.

    It started just over two decades before,
    As a boy of eleven I’d found quite a score,
    My mom’s boyfriend’s dirty magazines in a bedside drawer,
    I remember a sick feeling, “this is wrong”, which I chose to ignore.

    I can tell you of hundreds of times I’ve tried to leave her before,
    By now she doesn’t take these threats seriously.  What for?
    When I’d always come back, always go back on what I’d swore,
    I’d learned over time *I* couldn’t trust *ME* with her anymore.

    One day I felt something  new, deep in my soul,  great change at my core,
    Like my  once shame-sapped spirit crying out a great ROAR,
    I’m not out of this fight, I CAN conquer, I am Thor!
    I’m back in this, doing battle, I’M NOW MAKING WAR!

    I’m now sitting with a baseball bat, cross legged on the floor,
    With my back pressed up against the pounding and screaming at the door,
    A cell phone in my hand, ready to call for help if it looks like I’m done for,
    It isn’t pretty, being scared sh##less, of the whore at my door.

    I win my war when I don’t open that life-saving door,
    When I ignore her no matter how she implores.  
    When she just asks me to notice what this girl or that girl wore, 
    or to just click on this youtube video and “explore but no more”.  

    The pounding has ceased, no more scratches nor,
    screaming, from all the begging and yelling her lungs must be sore,
    but I can sense her there, breathing, waiting patiently… forevermore.
    I must and WILL be ever vigilant protecting self and home from the whore at my door.

So when I'm having a very difficult time, I just go and find something to replace it. Here are my top 5:

#1: Video games. This is practically cheating. Your body assumes the same relaxed position as porn surfing, with tension in your hands and an intense stare in your eyes, and the constant stimulation games give satisfies some of the chemical cravings of your brain. Distracts from the porn cravings well, especially with faster-paced games.

#2: Housework. I have no idea why but this really, really helps. If gaming isn't an option or isn't appealing, I'll go clean the kitchen or get the floors done or do the laundry. The cravings pass, I get a little light exercise instead of sitting on my butt, and my wife is impressed... which helps with #3.

#3: Actual sex with an actual person. This is nothing like PMO at all, and is NOT cheating! It's all about sounds and sensations and smells and momentum, and about cherishing this other human being for awhile... it's not like I didn't have sex when I looked at porn every day, but I used to try to think about sex the same way I thought about the porn: a means to an end, a way to ""scratch an itch"". Without porn it's about a shared experience, a relaxing, invigorating and fun activity that brings two people closer together. If you're single, see #4.

#4: Socialize. I find myself talking with family and friends a lot more than I used to. Call someone up and get out the door; catch up over coffee with one of those people you're ""supposed to care about"" like a work friend or uncle. Being in a social setting really takes the edge off the cravings, and when you've been porn-free for awhile it actually feels so much less forced and awkward than it might have before.

#5: Create something. Anything. Create a post here on Reddit. (My personal fave, obviously.) Write a story. Paint or draw or sculpt. Cook or bake. Do some landscaping. Rebuild an engine. Sing. Sew. Carve. Whatever you do, focus yourself on the task of making something in the world that wasn't there before. I don't know why but for me, when I've done this, it's this completely satisfying thing that, by the time I'm done, obliterates any little craving I might have had.

1365799328.0,45,self.pornfree,1c8agu,The most obvious benefits of r/pornfree,59,14,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/pornfree/comments/1c8agu/the_most_obvious_benefits_of_rpornfree/,"Every person on this subreddit has his/her own reasons for taking on r/pornfree, but for those of you who may be on the fence about partaking in this challenge, let me persuade you with several of the best and most obvious benefits.

1) **Tissue boxes last for-fucking-ever.** Before I would go through one every other week but with r/pornfree I feel like I'll never run out. Why you may ask? Because they only go on my nose, not on my dongle.

2) **You can put all that lotion to better use.** Ever had dry skin? Say no more, muchacho. Remember all that lotion you've wasted on your meat stick? Now you can put it ANYWHERE. That's right, you can use the lotion to smooth down those rugged rough shoulders, you can spread it all over your manly-ass biceps and make those puppies shine, or you can spread it all over a charming lady-friend (if she consents, but when she sees your sexy smooth lotion-lathered skin how could she refuse?).

3) **No more awkward dick struts to the bathroom.** You know what I'm talking about. You're sitting at your computer, fapping your life away, and you finish up only to realize that you have run out of tissues (see point #1). So you get up, hold your shirt up with your elbow, keep your spittle glazed baloney pony off your waistband with your dry hand, try to keep your not so dry hand off your favorite shirt, and you waddle your way to the bathroom to wipe your tallywhacker on some toilet paper like a constipated penguin. If you're like me, on the trip to the bathroom you're thinking, ""There's got to be a better way!"" WELL GUESS WHAT BITCH-TITS, CALL ME MOTHER FUCKING BILLY MAYS BECAUSE I'VE GOT A SOLUTION FOR YOU! Take the r/pornfree challenge and never again have to worry about your roommate/mom/girlfriend catching you do the dick waddle! It's that easy!

4) **Your pets will love you more.** Is there anything worse than being in the middle of an intense and borderline painful fapfest and having your dog/cat/beloved goldfish mosey on up to you and look you dead in the eye? Maybe stepping on a lego, but besides that it's pretty much the shittiest thing that is likely to happen to you on your Saturday night spent alone watching porn. Take the r/pornfree challenge and you no longer have to shoo your poodle from your noodle! No longer will you have to throw a blanket over your cockatoo's cage to keep him from seeing your cockatoo's rage! Think about it, this subreddit basically makes you Jane Goodall of your miniature animal kingdom.

5) **No more embarrassing lies.** Ever walk into a respectable climate with respectable chaps and respectable ladies only to realize you have a spittle spot on your shirt, an embarrassing remnant of your late night porn spree? Then you spend the rest of the evening thinking everyone is staring at it and so you tell people it's ""syrup"" that you must have spilled on yourself for breakfast? Yes, you have, and if you haven't then you still probably have and are just lying to me/yourself. Well you can wave those situations goodbye, because from now on the stains on your clothes really will be syrup instead of dick goop.

6) **Less confusion on laundry day.** No more will you have to look at your favorite shirt and say ""Is that doughnut glaze or jizz residue?"" No more will you have to play Russian Roulette with dirty socks on your floor, hoping to God that you didn't fill one up the night before after an intense porn session. No more will you look at a seemingly clean pair of underwear and after pulling them up to your knees you see the shimmer of sperm that sneaked into your pants after an unsuccessful dirty dick waddle.

7) **No more accidentally thinking about your relatives while your pants are down.** Seriously, nothing ruins your day quite like thinking of dear old Aunt Millie while you're exercising your third leg.

8) **Fewer boner-alerts.** Porn addicts, I know what you've been through. You see a pretty girl on the street and rather than thinking ""Hey, she looks quite pretty, and I can respect her not only for her good looks but also for her personality,"" you think ""JESUS TIT FUCK I WANNA BONE HER AND MAYBE EAT DONUTS OFF HER BUTT!"" And just like that, BAM! Instant boner-alert. Now you have to walk around holding something in front of you, or bent over at a 60 degree angle, or you have to walk behind someone large and pray that they don't stop abruptly causing you to poke them with your raging little Elvis. Take the this challenge and never compare women to ""that one porn star you saw when you were fapping on a sunny Friday afternoon alone"" and you can instead go out on that sunny Friday afternoon and see a pretty lady without instantly giving her a standing ovation in your trousers.

9) **Miscellaneous** Of course there are other things that will happen when you eliminate porn from your life, such as increased confidence, better self esteem, the ability to look people in the eye, a sudden power to seduce ladies left and right like you've suddenly become Antonio Benderas, fewer sexual problems like ED or impotency, spending your life living with people and pretty girls rather than fucking yourself every night til you cry your lonely ass to sleep, increased honesty and loyalty to your current or potential girlfriend/boyfriend or husband/wife, viewing women as humans rather than objects to succumb to your every whim, and you will feel less like SAP and more like OMM just to name a few. And of course you gain the ability to live your life without being shackled to the shallow, meaningless, poisonous lie that you *need* porn, that you can *never* live without it, or that sex is some mystical end-all objective that life revolves around. You will look at a porn star and think ""You know what? She poops. She's not any different from me, she's not some beacon to chase my whole life, she's no better or worse than I am."" You are not a dog chasing after cars that you can never catch, because the cars aren't even real and neither are the women you watch online or on tv or in magazines, they are just the empty shells the world wants you to worship. These ideas you have built up over years of being a prisoner to porn have only ever done one thing to you: Skew your reality from something you want. What you want is to live your damn life for all that it can be, but all that time that you wasted being porn’s bitch has done nothing but cover a hole you were too afraid to fill yourself. I know what it is like to use pornography as a tool to lie to myself about my insecurities, but life isn't lived under the pretense of a lie. Life is lived despite struggle, despite pain, despite feelings of inadequacy; life is lived with courage, the courage to overcome your demons.

So, are you strong enough to fill the hole you've covered?

Don't live the lie. Life is so much greater than that.

Hopefully what I have written resonates with some people.

There's some porn that I'm not proud that I've seen. Some of it is truly disgusting. I think there's a point in your porn ""journey"" where the novelty of each new viewing turns into a never ending quest. View long enough and you will eventually find a dark corner. You may not be into what's on screen, but that doesn't necessarily end the quest. Outside of my staples, there were plenty of times that I ventured far off my normal path, one which i most likely would never stray from in my day-to-day life. I didn't want to add more traffic to those type of sites. I didn't want that type of imagery a part of my memory. As they say ""garbage in, garbage out""

It's a waste of time on countless levels. I have been late or close to late numerous times because of my previous porn habits. I've spent hours viewing and accomplishing nothing at all because it was pleasurable ( at the time). All of that time is lost and those memories? They're not unique in any way. They didn't make my life any richer. I didn't become a better lover as a result. 

I have skipped out on engaging socially and my habits drastically dampened my desires to seek out a mate in real life. It was an easy reward with virtually no effort. I have dealt with social anxiety for most of my life. There are no short-cuts to learning how to engage people in a meaningful way. It's normal to feel that pull to be with people. It's not normal to withdraw behind a computer screen and only engage there.

A refrain that I have used to keep me on track has been to say, ""that's not how I want to live my life."" It's a distillation of my feelings about my porn habit. I feel like now that I have cut this from my life, I am left with the rawness of my situation. I can't hide behind something for comfort.

If I had to imagine what real life's cheat codes would offer, I think it would be the tastiest food, millions of dollars, and sex on demand. Porn already resembles the third cheat code for life. So does this mean that if we keep watching it, we will get bored with what life has to offer?

It never was  a daily thing, ever, but it was often. 

Watching that video made me think, at 42, I've had acces to BBS porn and my dad's stash of videos since I was 13 or 14. Just the possibility that it has re-wired my brain scares the shit out of me. 

I've never had a lot of success with women, I chalked it up to social awkwardness. My ability to perform sexually has never been that great--but I've been on anti-depressants and anti-anxiety meds for years. Frankly vanilla sex with a real live girl was just *boring*. 

The chance that this might even be the ROOT of my mental-health issues scares the hell out of me.

Porn really messed up my ideas of a healthy relationship. I started to use my fiancee as an object of my satisfaction, as a means to satisfy my urge. Rarely was there an emotional connection (for me anyways). She became  an outlet for my urges. She didn't want me to watch porn and I told her It became her responsibility to ""appease"" me if she didn't want me to. My emotions were often negative, selfish, degrading even. I was not the man she fell in love it. I was not interested in going out places, I did not want to show affection, I was not interested in going the extra mile for her when she needed me to emotionally be there for her. This has been the most painful experience of my life but never in my life have I learned so much.

Sorry if I come off as bragging. That's not my intention at all. What I hope to do is share my experience with those who are struggling and hopefully help them eradicate porn from their lives.

First off, this is something I've mostly kept to myself. Whenever I've told friends what I'm doing they sometimes think I'm preaching, even though I'm not. I just say it was a great decision and it feels great to have one less addiction. 

Here are some huge things I've learned along the way.

- **Porn is a visual drug.** You all know the feeling. When you're horny, opening up that first video is pure ecstasy. The more you watch, the more you want. Breaking free from this addiction is such a liberating feeling.

- **Your worst enemy is boredom.** One thing that kept me from looking at porn early on in my challenge was simply staying busy. No more mindless surfing late at night. Either go to bed or get stuff done. If it's during the day, go outside or something.

- **After a while, you lose count of your days.** This is a good thing. It's a sign of you phasing out porn from your life. You no longer care how long it's been since you last looked at porn. All you care about is the fact that it's not apart of your life anymore. When I got back on this subreddit today, I was surprised to see my counter because I just haven't thought about it lately. In other words, you start to think about more important things. Porn is simply an element of the past.

- **Temptation never completely goes away.** I can proudly say that I am usually not very tempted to look at porn anymore, even if I'm on my laptop at night in my bed. I just won't do it. Have I been tempted, even this far into the challenge? YES. In fact, one day I googled an old favorite video of mine and I was a click away from relapsing. Then I shut my computer and told myself that I can't do that after coming so far. If you are ever fighting off temptation, just tell yourself ""this isn't going to be easy, but it's going to be worth it.""

- **From the outside looking in, porn seems completely different.** I used to think of porn as something that ""all guys do"" and it's totally normal. BULL. SHIT. Porn is artificial reality that distorts your perception of sex and women. Once you imagine how weird the concept of fapping to porn is, it's easier to quit. Picture yourself sitting at your computer, looking at 2d images/videos of women you'll never get while you get yourself off. Then think about what you COULD be doing. You could be bettering yourself by a) having sex with real women b) forcing yourself to find women to have sex with, all while improving your game/social skills. It's no contest. WE DID NOT EVOLVE FOR MILLIONS OF YEARS TO FAP TO FAKE 2D WOMEN. Now go out there and spread your awesomeness within the gene pool.

- **You realize how strong you really are.** Remember, YOU control your urges. Your urges should not control YOU. Cheesy metaphor time. Off the top of your head, how many of your friends do you think look at porn regularly? The vast majority, right? As I said, it's an addiction and commonly perpetuated by society that it's ""normal."" Think of society as a lowercase ""i"". By overcoming this common pitfall, we become the dot of the i, and the rest of society is the body of the i. Does that mean we are ""better"" than them? No, but by doing pornfree you discover your strength and you don't let porn hold you back from reaching your true potential. And that is a fantastic feeling. Once you know this, you know that porn will never control you again.

I don't think I'm better than those of you on Day 1. I have my pitfalls. Plenty of them. For over a year I couldn't make it past 2-3 weeks. You can do it. I hope this post can help those struggling. If you want any more advice on fighting this addiction PM me.

I've recently relapsed and went on a PMO Binge. I had to step up my shields against porn.   
So far they've been a big help (and a big pain in the ass once you first get them on.)  
Most on here are for Google Chrome (I use chrome)  

**For All Browsers:**

* **K9 Web Protection:** http://www1.k9webprotection.com/  
* **OpenDNS:** http://www.opendns.com/  
Download K9, and set up OpenDNS (I have it set up for my computer only, instead of the network.)

**For Chrome/Chrome Extentions:** 
 
* **Christian Anti-Porn:** https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/christian-anti-porn/cgnkeghikpbknilcopgpiepciaenbfdi     
(even if you're not Christian, this is very useful while on Pornfree. The best part is, you can set up the block page to display whatever image you want to display. I've included a list of images for you to choose at the bottom of this post.)  

* **FoxFilter:** https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/foxfilter-the-content-fil/nopeodilnmhhlfageeohjojginlgeljk  
This is also available for firefox! Another content filter.

* **StayFocused:** https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stayfocusd/laankejkbhbdhmipfmgcngdelahlfoji  
A good extension to help you manage your time. Comes in handy while on Pornfree as well as NoFap.


These are the 5 Filters and Content Blockers i have set up on my laptop. Before my last relapse, I only had the first two (K9 and OpenDNS). I realized, after 100 days of NoFap, that i can easily get around my filters and come across porn. I've done NoFap for 104 days, but I never really stayed away from porn. So finally, today, I decide that i need to step it up a notch. Here's where the filters come in! The more shields I have up, the lazier i'm gonna be when it comes to turning them off.  
Well, I hope these resources are useful for you guys and gals!

Again, I hope this all helps. Goodluck everyone!

**EDIT:** Update, I decided that the FoxFilter is helpful, but it's also a big pain in the ass. It won't allow me access to /r/pornfree along with other non-pornographic websites. Even if I added these sites to the ""Allowed Sites"" list, it still cuts me off. Therefore, I've disabled the extension. So if you guy have the same problem, disabling FoxFilter may help.  
As of right now, I have K9, OpenDNS, StayFocused, and Christian Anti-Porn activated. It's doing me well for now :)  
Here's one more trick: **install [RES](http://redditenhancementsuite.com/download.html)** . And in the settings, **turn on the NSFW Filter.** Blocks all content on reddit that's labeled NSFW.

For over 15 years I never realised that I was completely and totally hooked.

It's funny.. when I first heard about YBOP/NoFap a couple of months ago, I reacted with two thoughts. 1) ""All I have to do is stop using porn to get erections for real girls? That's it?"" 2) ""Stop fapping... for 90 days? What? I can't stop for 90 minutes."" And that's how it was for me for the first few weeks. As soon as I saw the Gary Wilson TED video and learned the damage I had been doing to myself all this time with porn, I deleted every byte of porn I had, wiped my internet history and swore never to look at any porn again, ever. It seemed like a laughably easy task. This NoFap business, on the other hand, this seemed like a sheer impossibility. I didn't even consider it initially until with some reasoning I concluded that it would be necessary for me to do in parallel with NoPorn.

So I went about 3 weeks without porn, without the slightest twinge of regret at deleting my lifetime stash, and without any ""cravings"" for more. As for fapping, I was relapsing every few days, it was insanely difficult. Fast forward several weeks and I'm 13 days fap-free, the most I've been without in 16 years. But I just now reset my porn counter to zero, having just come out of a 2-day binge and yet another hard drive cleansing. What the fuck happened? The cravings I get to fap are manageable, I can fairly easily resist and ride any waves of horniness or discomfort that seek to perturb me. But with increasing frequency, I get hit with these tsunamis of compulsion to go to www.blah.blah/sickness to get that hit of wrongness that I know will damage me immensely as soon as i look at it. But I CANNOT resist.

The relapses have come in waves. The first time it was a couple of hot pictures on Facebook. The next time it was a longer look on gonewild. This last time was hours and hours on the web, saving pictures and videos to disk, just like in the bad old days. A progressive string of relapses back into a more permanent habit of daily use. Uh oh. I said ENOUGH just now and wiped the lot of it. But for how long? How long before the next unresistable urge?

What I think is most important - and what my purpose is on this journey - is that I feel connected with her in some deep, transcendent way that I wouldn't have been able to feel if I had continued watching porn. Our excitement and enthusiasm during our coitus would obviously not have been as prevalent if I had masturbated excessively.

I'm very glad I didn't think about resetting the day prior to today in order to last longer; lasting long proved to be not even the slightest concern.

I'm very proud to say this has been my first ejaculation all year, and it's also been the first time I've orgasmed with the help of someone else. I was much more impressed with this experience than any porn I have ever seen, or would have ever seen.

My heart was racing, and I wanted to jump up and sprint to my office just so I can remind myself what a random naked girl looks like. 

So, instead I sat there and calmed down, then told my wife everything. She laughed and said, ""well, if you go on through life not knowing what random naked girls look like, will it kill you?"".

I was looking at porn since long before I even knew what fapping was. It has had a pretty profound effect on my life and needless to say, I wasn't particularly popular with girls, now women, in high-school, university, grad school, etc. 

I had attempted to quit in the past, a few times here and there over the decades, but never considered it a real problem (it was) so I never made a concerted effort. I consistently mistook ""not wanting to quit"" with ""not being able to quit"".  I undertook pornfree back in May with varying degrees of success (not very much) up until this point. After the initial self-improvement wore off, things gradually returned to normal for me, minus the porn. I've discovered that a day is actually longer than I had previously thought, since I'm no longer wasting 2-3 hours every day in search of the *perfect* video. 

Do I notice a profound difference in myself? Yes, sort of. For the longest time I had a paradoxical perspective of women. I worshiped them, to the point where I could not even speak to them, but I also hated them because I thought they served no purpose other than to look pretty for us men and I felt angry because women were supposed to be there for men yet none wanted to be with me. Well, let's just say they had good reason to not be with me ;)

I'm happy to say though, my perspective of women is changing, and has changed quite dramatically since undertaking pornfree. I'm still shy, but not pathologically shy. My relationships with women have improved significantly and I'm beginning to enjoy other aspects of life as well. The damage that this addiction did is quite obvious now and I have no intention whatsoever to return to it now that I've made it this far. 

I expect that as 40 days climbs to 80 days and then 160 days and then an entire year, the changes will be even more dramatic.  

If nothing else, all I can say is this: Stay strong, brothers and sisters. You're doing this not only for yourself, but for all those around you who love you and for those who have not yet had the chance to love you. Whatever you do, don't go back.

Why? Well, think of the pre-digital-porn era. Say... caveman.  If a man wanted to see porn, I mean.. he couldn't. But for sex ,  he had to hunt. Then, if he wanted sex - he had to win a mate. Provide something. Etc.

Even 50 years ago, it took effort to get those magazines. You had to actually store and shuffle them.. you couldn't easily delete it.

Today, porn is always at most 2 or 3 seconds away from *anything* you're doing (it takes me 7 keystrokes to get to an XXX site ). I could be studying rocket science, then BAM! some neurons in my head shoot me off into porno-land. It's fuckin' ridiculous- how  easy it is to land into the dirty places. And all while you sit there, maybe sipping a soda and munching on chips. You might even be stimulated to orgasm without even touching  yourself - total sex-autopilot.

So this sort of suggests that, *if you have your guard down*, porn is really easy to slip into,  - and that's so easy to do too. Like now it's 12:50 am. quiet. *Nobody* sees me. *Nobody cares*. And *I know exactly* how to find the escape, and how I'd slip in.

But I have to remember that... #2 -  porn is sleazy.  Why? Everything is. The spyware I'll get. The dirty porn industry tactics( e.g.  rarely using condoms.. ). The brash in-your-face ads... pop-ups. The drug-laced actresses.  

I don't want to be a part of it.

I need support and help.,41,3,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/pornfree/comments/19fw9u/my_addiction_to_porn_ruined_my_life_i_need/,"Hi, I am a 30 year old male who has been addicted to porn for 14 years. Not only did I lose my fiance [I was with her for almost four years] because of my addiction but I also lost my job last week because my boss caught me watching porn instead of working. I am so ashamed. I haven't told family or friends yet. I don't think I can. It's too humiliating that I lost the girl and the job I love because of my addiction.
 
I am a devastated mess and I don't know what to do. My fiance was the love of my life. She tried her best to support me but it became too much. I hid it from her for the first couple of years but one day she came home from work early while I was on the computer looking at porn. She was hysterical at first but agreed to stay if I stopped. I tried [though at the time I wasn't willing to admit it was an addiction and didn't comprehend the full harm] but always relapsed quickly after. She caught me two other times, each time trying to forgive but two months ago she said she had enough after she caught me again. She said it was destroying her self esteem and she was no longer satisifed on an emotional and physical level in the relationship.

Two weeks ago I was [I thought] alone in my office [I have a desk job so I am on the computer most of the day] and my boss walked on me watching some softcore porn. She immediately asked me to step into her office and we had an akward talk. She then proceeded to look at my history for the week and saw it wasn't my first time looking at porn. Then last week after consulting with her boss as well, she decided to fire me.
 
So obviously I know now more than ever I need to stop NOW. I lost a job I love but more importantly, the girl I love. I just don't know where to start. The temptation surrounds me especially when I slip into depression even though I want and need this. I haven't even left the house for the last week except for groceries. My depression and ashame for myself has taken over. I feel like an overall failure.
 
A mutual friend of me and my ex fiance is getting married in a couple months and I want to try to stay clean until then so that when I see my ex, I can look her in the eyes and tell her that I've truthfully changed. That if she ever takes me back, I will do everything in my power to keep this change for both of us. I know it's a long shot but I still love her. I can't imagine my life without her. I accept that we may never be together again but I want to try to be the man she needs.
 

1.What were the very first steps you guys took in stopping your addiction? 
2. Did anyone else lose something because of porn?
3. Why did you quit? Did anything and anyone inspire you?
 Please share all your tips and stories here. 
 
Edit: I was skimming through here a bit and someone's post really caught my attention and rang true. They said something along the lines of how idiotic they realized they were being for trading their precious time in this life and things that make them genuinly happy for anonymous meaningless girls [or guys] that don't even care about them. 

I wish I could find the post of the guy that said it but thank you for that food for thought.

I struggled with trying to quit for about a year, but finally did it. I've been porn free for about 4 months, and don't see myself ever going back. I still masturbate, as I realized that wasn't my problem.

About 2 months ago, I got into a relationship with a girl who later became a cam-girl to earn some extra money. She earns $200 an hour to just masturbate on camera, so I have no problem with it. One day, I decided to watch her while she was working, just out of curiosity. Watching her masturbate on screen aroused me more than sex with her ever has. This is the same exact girl I've been sleeping with for 2 months. My brain has associated sex with a computer screen to such a degree that I'm actually hornier watching sex than participating in it. That's the real danger with porn. It's not real, and when people use it to replace sex, it really does replace sex. I watched porn for 6 years and am still new to real sex, so my brain still needs time to adjust.

I used to see porn as harmless videos that gave me pleasure. 

Here's how I see porn now. 

**It is empty.** Sex has always been the most intimate, pleasurable way for two people to show their love for each other. Porn strips away any love and emotion and just becomes bodies mashing against each other. 

**It is fake.** We all know that they're hired to make porn. But it's all so phony. It is not a sexual experience that involves us in any way. 

**It is watching strangers have sex.** When you stop and look it at from an outsider's perspective it's actually really creepy. Watching porn takes something that should be private, intimate and special between two people and you barge in on it. It's no better or different than a peeping tom. 

**It dulls the senses.** I know I've heard it and said it. ""Men are visual, I'm visual."" Well the porn's not helping. Sex should be about touch, smell, sounds, taste, and vision. It is a complete sensory experience. And porn only focuses one one of them (I'm ignoring the fake sounds). It reinforces that we should only be using our eyes, and that's not a full way to live or enjoy sex. 

**It is dehumanizing.** They aren't women anymore. They are just body parts. It's not a healthy way to treat fellow humans. Particularly when we aspire to have/maintain healthy, romantic relationships with women. 


I know everyone is different and I'm not trying to put anything down if it works for you. But this process for me is not about cold showers or building my willpower or depriving myself. It's about getting a wake-up call. Porn was never good for me, healthy or normal. I'm not going back because it no longer has an appeal.

It's largely been invigorating, though it has also been very difficult at times.  The difficulty, however, is a reminder of the depth of my addiction (i.e. if there wasn't a problem, then quitting porn would be easy).  As a way to keep myself motivated for the next three weeks, I thought I would write down (and share) the best reasons that have gotten me through the past three weeks.

1.     Porn is unfair to my time and my sense of self-worth – Simply stated, I am better than the immense amount of guilt and shame that attends porn addiction.  I am more than an afternoon wasted on porn Tumblrs, searching for that exactly right image to release to.  These ritualized sessions consume too much of my time and energy, leaving me less to devote to my actual day-to-day life.  Frankly, this is unfair to me.  
2.	Porn is unfair to my girlfriend – In a few months, my wonderful girlfriend and I will be moving in together.  I hope to be this woman’s husband someday, and I do not want to sneak around behind her back to get a fix.  This relationship—like all romantic relationships—cannot sustain both intimacy and porn addiction.  And in the choice between these two things, my girlfriend wins out every time.
3.	Porn encourages a poverty of imagination – As someone who makes his living through his creativity, it’s important that I exercise my creative powers as often as possible.  Thinking creatively has to be a habit of being.  And porn is lazy; it’s uncreative.  It is a passive entertainment that does not challenge me or push me to engage with it in any meaningful way.  And even more to the point, it had lost a lot of its passive, relaxing appeal.  Watching an hour of bad television is more genuinely relaxing than browsing porn because it engenders a lot less guilt and shame.  This is true of basically all forms of entertainment, regardless of how intellectually stimulating.  
4.	 Freedom from porn has made sex better – Even beyond the lack of guilt and shame about masturbating shortly after sex with my girlfriend, the actual sensation of sex is infinitely better.  Plus, I look forward to it with more simple anticipation, rather than that toxic mix of anticipation and fear.  And without the fear that I wouldn’t be able to perform, sex has simply become a lot more fun for both of us.  Sex is ridiculous amounts of free fun with someone you love.  Why wouldn’t I take every opportunity to make it even better?
5.	Freedom from has also made masturbation better – Really, it’s kind of incredible.  Focusing exclusively on the sensation of building an orgasm is a really amazing feeling.  Without that kind of divided attention—and porn addiction is highly ritualized, so you’re not actually focusing too much on the simple pleasure of masturbation—the sensation is more intense.  Again, the trade off is clear: masturbation without porn is simply better than masturbation with porn.
6.	Porn violates all of my feminist beliefs and instincts – I know in my heart of hearts that porn is fundamentally anti-women.  Sure, there is such a thing as sex-positive porn and feminist porn, but it’s few and far between.  The fact of the matter is that the mainstream porn industry to fundamentally built on the exploitation of women for the satisfaction of men.  Part of the reason for quitting porn was to align my actions with my beliefs.  
7.	I cannot healthfully consume porn – Just like there are plenty of people who can drink without becoming alcoholics, there are plenty of people out there who can look at porn and not let it consume them.  They have no overriding compulsion to spend hours watching videos and browsing images.  I am not one of these people.  I simply cannot consume porn without letting it affect all aspects of my life.  Recognizing that I am wholly incapable of casually consuming porn has been among the single most important realizations that I have had since I started three weeks ago. 

While these are all personal reasons that I will continue to revisit whenever I sense my will faltering, I also hope that someone might find them encouraging.  I've been a lurker for a while, and I have found a lot inspiration in this wonderfully supportive community.  The least that I can do is give back something.

It all started when i was around 13 or so when i just watched people making out on YouTube. Then I discovered that YouTube has lesbians videos on it! So i got hooked and just kept watching.

When I found out that there was porn on DailyMotion.com , i felt I had found a source of porn. Now i saw hot chicks getting their tits sucked by guys. I felt great, much better than the make out vids on youtube.

I became hooked to softcore pornography, because you don't see dicks/vaginas but it was actual sex. I had pledged that I would never see a video of legit porn, i.e. penis in vagina, anal etc. etc.

When I opened a link to a softcore porn movie, I though about what I was doing. What the hell am I doing? I'm fucking 15 years old! I have an entire life to live! I am a religious person from a religious family, and I imagined that if I died tomorrow that I would tell God that I spent hours in the last three years watching porn. No, that will never happen. I quit, no more porn. I guess the temptations really became huge when I started High School last year, hearing guys talk about their favorite porn and porn stars 24/7.

So i quit for like a week, then went back on Dailymotion today. I closed the browser, prayed to God, and started my new life. I heard of /r/nofap and I found /r/pornfree.

So Day 1 starts NOW! Wish me luck people, this seems like a great subreddit. First few weeks will be the hardest, so distract me and ask me wierd questions and shit haha.

Side Note: I've never masturbated and never will.

There wasn't even one incident in particular that made me realize I needed to quit. I think it was just a gradual thing. 

I'm still struggling with NoFap though. I can string together three days here or four days there and then I cave. But last night, just for the hell of it, I searched my history for tube sites and it had been 29 days, which honestly surprised me. I didn't realize it had been that long. 

Chronic masturbation is a problem. Needing porn to climax is also a problem. 

Learning how to masturbate incorrectly and giving myself TMS is an even bigger problem. 

On November 12th, 2011, I had a girl over to my house and we went back to my place after a drink or two. I had her naked, on my bed, begging for it. And I couldn't deliver. ED and just total insensitivity. It was horrifying. I remember waking up that Sunday morning with the worst feelings of shame I'd ever encountered. It wasn't that it was my first sexytimes or anything. I'm 24 and have had girlfriends and one night stands but it *was* the first time in probably a year that I had the chance to have sex. I'd had a *long* dry spell after a nasty breakup and had filled my sexual life with nothing but porn. Lots of it. 

But it's been 30 days, I've been seeing this girl for two weeks and we've already had awesome sex and I'm convinced that this is in part due to the fact that I haven't watched unrealistically good-looking people have sex all the time.

1. Don't bother reading the relapse posts. It'll give you the impression this is impossibly difficult, and it really isnt.
2. The first few days are the hardest. Habit is a hard thing to break, and once you start developing new habits, the urges will come less.
3. Own up to your decision. You don't want to look at porn, so don't.
4. Don't reset your badge unless you actually really fucked up. And even then, keep a running tab on how long you've been at it since the very beginning. You don't lose 100% of the progress if you relapse, but still it'll slow everything down and you're only punishing yourself.
5. If you find yourself starting to slip towards an episode, it's not too late to stop until, well, it is. So if you start going down that road, stop yourself and leave the computer.
6. Don't listen to these people saying it's like kicking heroin and other absurd claims. It will suck a little, but that will pass. And you will not have physical withdrawals (except maybe dead dick, but nothing bad), so it's not even as bad as an alcoholic quitting alcohol.
7. It's TOTALLY POSSIBLE. You'll get through it if you commit yourself. Don't get into the victim mindset and quit on yourself. These twelve-step groups tend to turn into pity-parties. You'll never do anything if you feel sorry for yourself, so don't.

Background: been a spiraling porn addict since before we were married-- hid it, of course. Discovered repeatedly over our many yrs.

But how would she ever believe in me again?

She was very kind in listening to me last night. But she made no bones about letting me know she had come to regret marrying me. We have become ""best friends and roommates who happen to be raising kids.""

I left her feeling trapped, like she had to settle for a bloodless, mediocre life, when we both know she could have and should have much more. I did this. Not we...

But she's here for now. 

She says she'll watch the videos, poke around pornfree maybe. I haven't asked for her ID, but I've given her mine.

This summer, starting around late june, I got really back into porn, stopped working out, stopped meditating, and pretty much lost all motivation. Slept for 12 hours day. Worked around 5 days, not even full shifts. Stopped going to my job. Have around $12 in my bank account and am procrastinating on going back to college next semester (i'm probably too late). Anyway, It got to the point where I was lasting for a week porn free, and then every sunday-tuesday I would lose it and look at porn for hours on end. A few days ago I looked at porn, yesterday I looked at porn, and I was about to go to bed today, and then my ballsack had to remind me about a conversation I had with my friend in which he said ""my favorite porn star is Lexi Belle"". Of course I looked her up, and found her most hardcore video within 3 minutes. I had watched a few short ones of her before, and was down to watch the entire 45 minute long video. As it started, I genuinely listened to what she was saying... the words... were just too much. She was so sweet, seemed so nice. I could tell she was hiding a lot, I could tell she hated what she was doing, she just seemed like she was mentally and spiritually destroyed by her decisions to be in the industry, but I could still see her soul, barely flickering. I stopped the video before she got naked and just cried. Why does it have to be this way????  I hate it! Why do I even do it??? Why does SHE even do it?? I've done this so much, I've told myself so many times that I'll stop, but I only further the death of not only my mind, but HERS. She's my age and has enough sexual experience to last a lifetime or two. Every time someone watches her videos, it only furthers her popularity, and eventually leads to more of her ""performances"". She reminds me of someone I would fall in love with... it's disgusting what path she's chosen, but I can't help but feel the most genuine form of human empathy.

i was 4 or 5 the first time i was exposed to pornography, at my babysitter's house. her 15 y/o brother had playboys that he showed me from time to time. one day when i was 6, i found a pornographic movie in the vcr that my parents forgot to put away. it wasn't long after that that i found their collection of hardcore magazines. they added video tapes over time. i'd look at all of it any time my parents left me home alone. sometimes i'd show it to my friends. it was exciting because it was forbidden and because i might get caught. the sexual content was exciting too, but i didn't really understand that up until about age 12.

as an adolescent, i started to collect pornography of my own. this was before the internet, so i mostly had sketchy friends of sketchy friends buy it for me. my collection was tapes and magazines. at age 14, i came home one day and realized that my parents had found it. i was scared and embarassed, but they never mentioned it. i took that as a green light. i kept collecting, and started putting explicit pictures over my bed, and inside my looseleaf notebooks that i took to school. my friends thought my parents were the coolest.

my first year of college, i actually had enough friends, and a girlfriend, that i didn't spend much time with pornography. i got into alcohol. i left college after my sophomore year.

by the time i left college, i was drinking all the time. i kept this up for about another year. i was depressed and lonely, and at this point i had the internet. pornography got incorporated into my drinking rituals. eventually i acknowledged that drinking was ruining my life, and i stopped. now i just had a pornography problem.

like a lot of other people, i didn't know pornography was something that a person could even have a problem with. when i quit drinking and went back to college, i felt excluded from the social scene, since most of that revolved around alcohol, and i didn't make much effort otherwise to make friends. from this point on, i didn't really have girlfriends. i leaned on pornography to satisfy my sexual needs and to help me deal with my loneliness. 

i've also used pornography to relieve anxiety. specifically it's the search for new pornography that i use. the problem is that i find myself looking for pornography instead of ... fill in the blank -- spending time with my family, spending time with my friends, doing work-related things, exercising, reading a book, etc. and the real problem is that i've acknowledged this, but the craving can overwhelm me, or sneak up on me, or get at me in any number of ways so that i'm sitting in front of a computer screen looking for pornography. and i may be sitting there saying to myself, 'you're not enjoying this, what are you doing?' or, 'that's enough, why don't you go ahead and stop now?' 

but i keep going.

i've kicked two addictions in my life: alcohol and cigarettes. pornography is the most shameful of my addictions -- the others seem almost socially acceptable by comparison -- and i want to kick it too. i'm very glad there's a place like this where i can spill my guts about this, and where i can receive and give support in a community that understands what this struggle is.",,False,,t5_2rglh,False,,week3,True,t3_1irj1k,http://www.reddit.com/r/pornfree/comments/1irj1k/hello_im_addicted_to_pornography/,

And once of the steps in the books was outlining why I was really seeking porn. 

A month ago, my answers were to shrug my shoulders and say ""it feels good"" and ""relieved stress."" That's all I thought about it. Something that was in my life for 17 years, and I never analyzed why I was doing it. Here's what I've found so far:

1. I have emotional pain. I felt rejected by all the girls around me in middle school and high school. There were occasions where girls made fun of me and I felt like I wasn't good enough to get a girlfriend. Not attractive enough. Not cool enough. Despite later getting girlfriends and getting married, that pain persisted. Except I never dealt with it. I sought porn because I craved validation that I was good enough. I got the ""attention"" and ""sexual interest"" from women, even though it was in videos. (Of course, it didn't actually fulfill me, but that's another story.)

2. I had messages, brain signals telling me I needed to get off. This was the addiction talking. About every 3 days since my last orgasm, I would get a message from my brain saying that I should get off as soon as I could. That I would get irritable and stressed if I didn't. That it would only be worse tomorrow. And masturbating with porn was the only way I knew how. 

3. I was addicted because I was addicted. It was a habit. When I had the opportunity I did it without thinking about it. I craved the chemical rush. It was a fleeting pleasure, like eating a candy bar. But I craved it anyways. Only afterwards could I see it for what it really was. That it was empty and fake and only made me feel worse. 

Those are the main reasons I've unearthed so far. I may find more in the future. 

Edit: 4. I realized that it was not just emotional pain from youth or simply ""stress"" that drove me to porn. It was a feeling that I couldn't have what I wanted. A few years ago it was because I wanted a promotion, new job, a move to a different state, a baby, and none of it was coming through. In the last few years, it was because I wanted time to write more, play video games, exercise, go on dates, watch TV and I couldn't have it all. 

I think it's telling that after I went to porn and got off, I would often go to food as well. That I didn't find the comfort or fulfillment I was seeking, so I looked someplace else. 

Perhaps there are some of you out there who have had trouble with relapses and maybe by getting to the root of why you are seeking porn, you can address the motivations and won't be as tempted by porn in the future.

But after a year and a half of being fap-free and only a handful of porn incidents in that time (only one real binge.. not fun when you can't jerk it), you'd think it would get a lot easier.  In some ways it does, but when those cravings hit hard, the fact that it's been a long time makes the old curiosity meter skyrocket.  Think of all the porn that's been uploaded since the last time! 

But the bright side to this long stint is that I can't easily shove down the guilt and shame associated with viewing porn like I used to.  Every time I look at porn is something of an event.  It's a major stumble.  Even if it's not ""real porn"" but merely sexy photos is something I cannot look past easily.

And so, what has been helping me today is the memory of just how terrible I feel after watching porn, and really, while I watch it as well. There's a lot of excitement, but there's also a lot of guilt.  And the shame doesn't pass afterward, it tends to build until I've confessed my screwup to my wife and/or accountability partner.  And then I've got the consequences from my wife as well (which are not likely to help us get past this hiccup in our sex life any quicker).

For 20 years I've looked at the immediate pleasure rather than the eventual consequence.  These days I've been reversing that, and it helps.  No bit of pleasure or stress relief is worth the gut wrenching feelings I have after it hits me that I've screwed up again and set back my recovery.

Sometimes I've got cravings to consume pornography, or at least something sexually arousing, *even if I don't have an erected penis*, and I believe that this is the key sign of the addiction. In such moments I just feel like I want to *consume some porn first*.

I use the word *consume*, rather than *watch*, because it doesn't necessarily have to be visual pornography. It doesn't make much difference whether these are written or spoken stories, hardcore anal HD scenes, or just innocent photos of women I know personally.

No, tell them! Just do it, man!"" and it drove me nuts so I shouted I HAVEN`T WATCHED PORN IN 26 DAYS. They looked at me, going ""wtf, why?"" and I started explaining about my addiction.  
  
It felt so good, holy shit. I felt my shoulders lowering and a deep sigh of relief. Every tension in my body just let go. I know both of them are porn users but I didn`t want to be that who guy were telling them to stop and be a douche like that. But I did go on a rant about how unnecessary porn is and how it clouded up my brain.    

They both had their own reaction and they were quite contrasting. One was like ""that`s awesome, I am really proud, you are brave to come forward"" and my other friend argued that watching porn was just like having a nice meal and eating good food once in a while. This made me really annoyed. Eating is something you do to not die, you`re not watching porn to survive. Come on man.  

I know he was partly being the devil`s advocate but I also sensed that he was justifying his own porn use. ""I can learn something from porn, and use those things with my GF"". I got really mad by that statement, there is no ""learning"", you are fooling yourself, you are brainwashed.

There's no magic trick to stopping. There's no special software or internet filter. It's you. That's all there is. YOU are the strongest tool that you have, and by that I mean your self control. The only way to recover from addiction is to exercise your self-control, otherwise no matter what you do, you'll be just as weak (to resist porn) as when you first started.

Remember, and remind yourself. When you're feeling like your having a lapse in judgment, remind yourself of these moments. It doesn't matter how you do it, personally I keep a journal and write little reminders on post-its. and as crazy as it sounds, remind yourself audibly.

It sounds stupid but there's something powerful about the words actually coming out of your ""I'm stronger than this"" ""Is this going to be worth it"" ""Porn doesn't control me""

Porn DOES NOT control you!

You're in control. YOU decide. YOU have the power and self-control to resist.

This is CRUCIAL, you have to regain the power of your thoughts. You must remember that YOU are the one in control and nothing and no one can make you do anything you don't want to do!

If you've been watching porn for as long as I have then I know how it feels, you can be your own worst enemy at times, but it's time to start fighting back.

One last point: Relapse isn't the enemy of recovery, it's actually essential it. It's how you react to your relapse that determines the progress of your recovery.

In other words: STOP HATING YOURSELF WHEN YOU SLIP UP!
It's going to happen, no one is immune from it. So, when it does happen, prepare to react well. Don't pity yourself, and don't shame yourself. This will most likely lead to binging, which is the undoing of recovery (not relapse). Move on, and move forward...quickly! the minutes after the relapse are crucial, don't hang your head down low, and be sure to smile, things are getting better and will continue to.

I just wanted to give a little encouragement to those who have been at it for awhile and to those who have just begun.

you're here...that's a HUGE step!! Good job and keep it up!!

An anecdote from my own dark days of porn addiction:

About 6 months after breaking up with my wife some friends took me to a strip club.  I went into a private room with a total goddess, pretty and with the most amazing body; easily the match of the all but the truly elite porn stars.   She had work done but it was all subtle and classy.  She was literally one of the most attractive women I have ever met.

She stripped completely naked and climbed onto my lap and let me do whatever the hell I wanted with my hands and mouth while she cheerfully gyrated and squirmed all over me for about 10 songs.  Nothing.  Not even a partial erection.

I had PMOed to many women far less attractive on the internet and this real life porn star did nothing for me at all.  That should have been another clue that I was completely messed up, but it was another six months before I seriously started trying to fix myself.

Porn is:

1) Anything (apart from human interaction or your imagination) that you intentionally seek out for the purpose of achieving arousal

2) Anything you lose interest in after masturbating (again, apart from human interaction or your imagination)

3) Any sort of media that you would not mention to friends/family because of it's sexual content (eg. I wouldn't casually tell my girlfriend that I watched a video of two girls kissing)

4) Any sort of media that makes you feel like you're falling back into your old habits or any sort of media that may lead to you breaking any of the first three rules.



*EXAMPLE: Game of Thrones*

Game of thrones has a lot of sexual content, so using ""Minnow's Razor"" I can determine whether or not it is porn.

1) I don't watch GoT for arousal, I watch it because it is a good show.

2) I don't lose interest in GoT after masturbating

3) I would tell people in polite conversation that I watched GoT

4) *BUT!* All the sexual content makes me want to watch online videos of porn

Conclusion: GoT is not something I should watch.

My longest streak was 53 days.  Then 23.  Recently I've been relapsing about once per week, but no binging, so that's a good thing.  

My most recent relapses have allowed me to try some new techniques and objectively observe WTF is going on, why I've been relapsing, etc. 

We always talk about ""triggers"" which is a legitimate topic, but, for me, there are simply TOO MANY triggers!  A hot gal on a magazine cover.  A girl jogging down the street.  A cute newscaster.  It's ridiculous.  

I've concluded that I'll NEVER be able to avoid triggers.  They will always be there.  What I've learned over the past few days is that **I HAVE TO control my mind**.  

There's no other way around this.  Whenever the slightest urge to purge hits, I IMMEDIATELY nope my brain away from it.  Some examples:

* While driving home, I saw a cute girl walking down the street.  Started to think about finding her lookalike in a video--""NO,"" in my brain, ""check out the trees blowing in the wind.  Why is it so windy today?""  Plus, I thought about other random mundane items.  It worked.

* Riding the porcelain Honda, picked up my wife's US mag.  Article about stars and their ""bikini bodies""--""NOPE.""  Dropped the magazine...and instead read the instructions on a box of razors.  Started talking in my Seinfeld voice: ""Why do we need 5 blades?  Are we gonna have 6 soon?  How many is too many blades?  Seriously, these things are starting to look like cheese graters or wash boards.""  This also worked.  

* Surfing Reddit, a sexy gif wasn't blocked by K-9--""NO.  Not for me.""  Immediately clicked it closed, got up, and hugged my dogs.  One of my dogs has really bad breath.  I then went ahead and brushed their teeth.  Again, worked.  

Being so fresh off of a few relapses has showed me the path **I** take that leads me to PMO.  

These triggers will never go a way or be completely avoided (I live in So Cal.  Seriously.) but what I do after those triggers **is all in my brain**.  

If I can continue to NOPE the thoughts out of my head, divert, **choose**, not dwell on the P, fill the boredom with real life, I think I can beat this thing.

Good luck, brethren (and [sistren?](http://oxforddictionaries.com/us/words/what-is-the-female-equivalent-of-brethren)).

I decided I had a problem with online porn a couple of month ago when I had successfully managed to bring a girl back to mine to do the nasty and I failed to get or maintain an erection.

 I'd never noticed this as a problem before and I because seriously seriously depressed. I had to take a step back and think about what was going on. At 23 it was utterly demoralising to be getting what I thought was ED and made me seriously seriously depressed. I stopped hanging out with my friends, I missed university classes because of the anxiety and low self esteem I had. I was reading online for something that could help me and noticed so many people talking about internet porn being a huge cause of ED in young men. I decided I had to go cold turkey because the ED was ruling my life and turning me from a normally confident outgoing guy to someone who just sat in their room and feeling sorry for themselves. 

I am now 2 months free of internet porn and it revolutionary. I can now happily get erections with a bit of manual stimulation and last night I had the most satisfying sexual experience of my life porn-free. I have so much respect for all of you guys fighting to stay porn free and I say you can and more people should.

Thank god i'm glad i was on the safe side when i woke up :). This made think about this and share my ideas on this to you. Hardcore internet porn doesn't even sound interesting to me now. Think about it guys, it's the worst thing you can desire... Sure, when your brain begs for stimulation it might want it, but deep inside you, you don't want it. It's pretty sad because we relapsed many times over the same mistake thinking that porn was the answer and trying to find reasons why you should relapse. And of coure WE ALL KNOW WHAT HAPPENS AFTER WE RELAPSE. We become depressed in deep self-pity that stays there for a week (thats with me). What i really want right now is real love from a girl not harcore internet porn. I've noticed that since i stopped using this demon, i've been more calm and relaxed than ever. But when i was using it i was always worried, anxious, angry, etc.. It was truly hell. Thats why i recommend to you guys to write down the goals that you're going to achieve through this reboot. Basically why are you rebooting? Is it to give up the hardcore porn that demonized you? Or is it for example to get rid of ED? Of course ED is a problem for me too so that's one of my goals. Doing this puts things in perspective so you have a REASON to leave porn and you're not just doing it for the hell of it, you know? Make sure that when you get an urge to watch porn you take a few minutes and think if it's a good idea. Think about the consequences.. Is it really worth it? For just 5 quick minutes of brain stimulation is it worth it to feel shitty, regret, deep sorrow, and above all have to REdo ALL the work that you've wasted? And the funny thing is that it happens over and over where we relapse thinking that it's not gonna harm us at all, but then we all know what happens. No it's not worth it and that's why you need to give up porn FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE because it does MUCH harm. Remember you're only human so it's ok if you've recently relapsed over and over and not learned from it.

It was a gut-check straight to reality for me in a lot of ways. As my son grows and interacts with me more and more, two things have become clear. He is a sponge. And he is always watching.

How this relates to porn use takes me back to the first time I came across porn. I was 11 years old, and found my dad's ""stash"": a dubbed VHS copy of a cheesy HBO After Dark flick. I was sneaking into his closet sneaking a peek at something much more innocent: his baseball  card collection. I found the video, popped it in, and before too long, his addiction was mine. He never learned that I had found his hiding spot, so every 2 weeks or so, I was treated to a new video. Then, we got the internet...

I love my father, and I don't judge or count his struggles with porn against him. Nor do I blame him for my addiction. I've been down that road, and it's counterproductive.  While I believe an 11-year-old is far too young to process that kind of material in a healthy way, I am no longer 11. I am a man, and I am capable of making my own decisions, for better or worse. 

That said, I refuse to provide my son the same entry-point into that world. I can go to lengths to cover my tracks; going incognito, clearing my search history, clearing my router logs, etc. But kids are clever. My dad thought he had his bases covered, and he was never the wiser. I am sure that somewhere in his life, my son will find his way to his first X-rated material, but it won't be from checking my browser history.

And when he comes to me asking about it (or vice-versa), he won't see me as a hypocrite, punishing him for following in my footsteps.

I will live as a model for him, so that the man he grows up imitating leaves him with a sense of integrity that I am only beginning to learn in my adulthood.

At least, I won't give up trying.

""I have learned pornography is highly addictive and has nothing to do with sexual appetites and everything to do with escape.  And that the habit is never overcome in isolation.""

Even after a nearly 3 month streak here on reddit, I fell.  In short, temptation abounds and giving in just a little is a little too much.

So today I was really feeling tempted. I'm married, love my wife, have 4 wonderful kids, but I was just being bombarded with temptation.  It was driving me nuts.  Doing all I could to get pernicious thoughts out of my head seemed overwhelming.

Then, I went to my church's website (this is not a preachy post) and saw a short video entitled ""Enduring Love.""  It is a clip about a husband who appears to have Parkinson's, who is caring for his wife who appears to be stricken from a stroke.

Watching this video made me think about my wife and the long life I hope to have with her.  Watching the husband shaking as he put the spoon up to his wife's mouth to feed her breakfast, and combing her hair etc. to get her ready for the day reminded me of what love really is.  In my opinion, love is service without requesting anything in return.  Love is patience.  Love endures.    

Though my comments re love is opinion-based, I think it's safe to say that porn is not love; it's lust.  And I can promise you that a relationship based on lust will never endure, which is why, when I engage in the lustful relationship with porn, i find myself back at square one once I've come to my senses.   

That video and thought on love, my friends, helped me stay clean for one more day.  Again, I'm no model citizen when it comes to being clean, but I am clean today, and for the past 51 days.  If I can take this one day at a time, I think I can continue moving forward.

I often see people try to beat around this addiction &amp; wonder ""When can I or can I ever start PMOing again."" Now we've already talked about why you shouldn't because of the pathway of addiction that has been created for life in your brain, but here is another compelling reason for you.

* **10,000 Hour Theory**: A study was done by Anders Ericsson to find a common denominator amongst people who reached high levels of performance in their field. (Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, The Beatles, Famous Athletes, Beethoven, Issac Newton, Ray Thomas, ext.) What he found was that all of these people that have achieved greatness had committed an average of 10,000 hours into their field starting at an early age, none of these examples started off experts in their field, in fact a lot of them were considered failures (Issac Newton, Beethoven, Walt Disney, Michael Jordan, Steve Jobs, ext.) But despite their failures they continually persisted their goals &amp; invested hour upon hour of grinding to achieve what they were born to do.

* **The Breakdown**: 10,000 hours can be broken down into 2 hours a day for 15 years. Now I haven't done an actual study but for myself &amp; what I tend to see on post is that most people have been addicted to PMO for about 10-20 years. Do you see were I am getting at with this? To put it simple we have all most likely invested 10,000 hours (more or less) in becoming a PMO Master if you will. Think about that for a second, think of your dream job or dream profession whether you actually realistically ever conceived that it was something you could actually do. Now of course their is other factors like proper habits, &amp; ""deliberate practice"" that account for level of expertise certain people reach but that doesn't change the fact that their is a certain amount of hours one must invest to achieve greatness. While we practically jerked ourselves out of extinction, there were people no different than us achieving greatness with that time. 

* **Defense Mechanism**: Please don't bother playing the victim or offended ""card"" &amp; begin talking about what you have gone through or how you weren't born with the necessary ""advantages"". Take the time to really read the background stories of people who achieved greatness, see that they are no different then you, that they too have been born into disadvantaged backgrounds, that they too have risen from abusive families, that they too had lived lives no different then that of you, your friends, or your loved ones. There is no excuse to not live to your full potential my friend, it is your responsibility as someone who has the privilege of good health &amp; a working body &amp; a functioning mind to use them to their full potential because there are a lot of people out their who aren't so fortunate. So often we focus on what we don't have that we don't realize everything we do have.

Please forgive for the lack of sunshine &amp; flowers, but I am trying to ingrain a compelling reason, heavy shit if you will, to not only beat any and all addictions but to live like you were meant to live. Why not see what you are capable of, because I believe that you have much more potential then you could ever imagine. Scratch that, I **KNOW** that you can do more much more then you had planned.

* **The Point**: Now the point of this isn't to pile some more regret on how we've spent the past decade, life is a journey &amp; that past decade has lead you here &amp; if you are here then you are ready to change and grow. do not dwell on what you haven't done but instead focus on what you outta begin to do. Let's not feel remorse for what we could've done with those 10,000 hours of PMO but what we will be able to do with those extra 10,000 hours we will have from never PMOing again!

&gt; Man cannot remake himself without suffering, for he is both the marble &amp; the sculptor. -Alexis Carrel 

* **What about my Needs?** You can masturbate in the future that isn't the problem, but lets be honest I doubt you've ever spent two hours simply masturbating, that must get boring &amp; if you have that kind of patience you really do have potential my friend. Though when your living **YOUR LIFE** you wont feel the need to masturbate, you'll be to busy being awesome, giving back &amp; being a loving partner to your significant other or future significant other. You won't find your SO in your pants you'll find her by living.

* **Get to it**: I want you to write down all the things you have ever dreamed of doing, choose a couple or the most meaningful goal that you thought of &amp; begin to spend your next 10,000 hours making that dream a reality. I don't care how old your are, how much money you have, what shape your in, just begin &amp; keep going because there is nothing inside of you, that makes you different from anyone else who has achieved greatness, the only difference is your **Mindset*. So get to it my friend.

Remember, we my friends can make our wildest dreams a reality.

1374230528.0,26,self.pornfree,1imgx5,Over a year pornfree - some thoughts,30,4,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/pornfree/comments/1imgx5/over_a_year_pornfree_some_thoughts/,"Hi, just want to outline some thoughts about the past year since I stopped using porn.

Firstly, I suggest the following for getting off porn or, more importantly, moving towards having the kind of life you want:

a) Keeping a journal.
b) Setting out your goals.
c) Getting counseling.

Keeping a journal helps to objectify your thoughts - it helps you to come to conclusions about things and clarify things in your mind. It's kind of like self-counselling - it helps you to become honest with yourself. (more on this here: http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/oliver-burkemans-blog/2013/jul/18/why-keeping-a-journal)

Writing or typing out your goals is a great way of orienting yourself away from the lifestyle you don't want (e.g. staying at home, working in a job you don't enjoy, etc) and towards the things you do want to do with your life. I review and update my goals every day or every few days and it's had a transformative effect on my life over the last few months. (this article started me out on this: http://markmanson.net/life-purpose)

Counselling has been great in helping me form relationships with women. I go to a female counsellor and I think that's important. Much of our porn use (or other habits we would not like to continue, e.g. I used to see escorts) stems from an inability to communicate meaningfully with women. We feel, when we're talking to them, that we have something to hide. Being completely honest with a female counsellor about my past and my life - it's helped me to put it into context, to realise that I'm actually a good person with things to offer etc. I'm much more relaxed and at ease with women nowadays, although I still have some way to go.

By way of illustration, a couple of months ago I made friends with an attractive woman. We got on well together and I plucked up the courage to tell her everything about myself. We went on to have a brief sexual relationship, and then she decided that she just wanted to be friends. This definitely hurts - just being friends - but we are good friends and I enjoy her company. But the point is that in the past - I never had this kind of relationship (with the one exception of a year when I was on anti-anxiety/SSRI pills (lustral/zoloft)). The point is that you can have a fuller life and better relationships with women if you can overcome your fear of expressing yourself with them.

I think pornfreedom is a great step in moving towards the kind of life you want because it takes you away from the computer and forces you to try to form better relationships. Personally, I wouldn't dream of using porn to get off nowadays. I can't say that I'm 100% comfortable with my sexuality yet - I still have a long way to go, but definitely much more chilled out about it than I was a couple of years ago. 

Anyway, good luck all. I'm not going to post much here because I try to limit my time on the net, although I will engage in discussion about this and ask me anything if you want. I suppose I'm posting it because it's something I want to share, without necessarily putting my real-life name to it.

It has been a busy summer, so that's helped a lot. Before starting pornfree I'd spend a lot of nights and bored times looking at porn, camming, and jerking off; activities that I consider a waste of time and harmful to my psyche and to the relationships I'd like to have and maintain. 

Today I'm bored. I have the day off--a Wednesday--so none of my friends have the day off. I've done errands, I've worked out, I've gone to lunch, I've watched some shows, I've gone for a walk.

This isn't my first walk in the park, so I know the thoughts will pass and my mind will calm down, but right now I'm real close to asking a neighbor to serve me with a hearty bitch slap. I'm fighting hard, I'm gonna win the battle today, but it's never easy.

I think it is time we differentiate ourselves from NoFap due to this.  Here is what I am suggesting:

1) Determine a guideline for following the ""Pornfree Challenge"".  
    -  While this may seem like a no brainer it would be nice for people to understand what pornfree really is and why it differentiates from NoFap... i.e: 

A) Never watch porn.
B) When horniness is induced, release yourself into a toilet while meditating/ focusing on the sensation of masturbation (finding what feels good).  DO NOT CREATE AN IMAGINARY FEMALE. DO NOT USE DEATH GRIP.  Work on Kegels during these sessions.
C) Only masturbate when necessary to relieve yourself from potentially viewing porn and limit yourself to once a day.  As time goes on you will want to only masturbate once every two days, then three days, and finally up to once a week, which builds your self control.
D) If you suffer from ED or PE, do 100 Kegels per day.
E) Whatever else we can think of that should be part of the challenge/ lifestyle

2) We should put a note in the sidebar as to why this is different than NoFap.  The lure of NoFap has differed the main reason why YBOP was so influential and turned it into a song and dance that only inhibits desires and draws the person back into porn.

These are just a few ideas that I have had because I truly am afraid that people have forgotten the true reason behind NoFap.  This community has a chance to be something better that addresses the root cause of the issue... PORN!  Let me know what you think and please let me know if i'm completely off the mark.

Porn fucks with the way my mind works. 

I have a personality of excess. I overuse every substance or material or medium that gives me pleasure: alcohol, video games, marijuana, cocaine, ecstasy, the internet, fried foods, porn. 

They all fuck with the way my mind works. They've left me in a mental fog over the last few years-- staying out to late, getting too fucked up, sleeping in too late, lacking motivation to accomplish personal goals, seeking sexual gratification without human spirit, bleeding drying the enormous potential I possess. 

But I've begun to come around. That's the key: to make myself whole again. I can't just quit it all cold turkey. There's no reset button for me to press. I have to talk myself off the cliff--not just jump off and respawn. 

The changes I've made: 10:30 bed time and 6:30 wake up for weekdays (sticking to it 70% so far); limit junk food to 1 meal on the weekend ( 50% so far); eliminate hard drugs (so far so good); limit drinking to 2x a week (80%); eliminate porn (100% for 46 days).

The changes I still need: set a drink limit for times I do drink; set a time allowance for video games; set limits on marijuana use; find romance again. 

This is my battle to become the person I want to be. I've posted this for the calmness and clarity I feel now for spilling this out, but also to make the point that many of us in this group are not just simply addicted to porn.

We are victims of minds diseased by overstimulation. Tangled in a web of pleasure.

Make a plan. Begin the slow withdrawl from unfocused, undisciplined, lethargic, apathetic, asocial avatar you are and set small, simple steps toward the you who should have always been there.

Not even in some dramatic, binge-type way where I look at porn for hours and hours and jerk off so much that I feel deathly afterwards. Nope. I've simply returned to looking at porn for maybe half an hour a day. Maybe not every day. And what I've learned is this: I do it because it's easier than not doing it. Because when I can't sleep, it gives me an excuse to stay awake. Because when I don't do it for too long, the cravings get so bad that it feels like porn controls me. But for the past two weeks, it hasn't controlled me. Or at least... that's what it's felt like.

But what I've realised is: that's why I need to quit. Not because of all the reasons I had before. The fear of ED when in an erotic encounter (not a major problem but definitely a niggling fear due to past experiences); the fear that I'm an antisocial person without it; the wanting to become a better man...

These reasons aren't enough. What I realise is, I have to prove to myself that I can face discomfort. That is all. It is not possible, physiologically or psychologically, that I will remain uncomfortable for the rest of my life if I abstain from porn. It will just be a period. I don't know how long this period will last for. But I have to find out. And it's kind of like procrastination... Each time I jerk off, each time I type in my regular old porn site URLs... it's just staving off the many and long moments where I feel incomplete. And it's not right to feel incomplete without porn. It means I'm missing out on all the facets of life. 

But I have to remember that abstaining is not magical. It's not some panacea for all life's problems. That's where I fell behind before. I got disappointed, whether I realised it or not. I didn't feel those wonderful benefits that everyone talks about... at least not for any significant amount of time. And jerking off just once a day to a little bit of porn doesn't seem to change me too much. 

But... I must find out. I must stop procrastinating. ",,False,,t5_2rglh,False,,year1,True,t3_14fp3o,http://www.reddit.com/r/pornfree/comments/14fp3o/what_ive_learned_from_returning_to_porn/,

For the past week or so, I've been doing just fine, until today. I got an incredible urge like never before. I was contemplating giving in, but instead, I decided to dig deeper to find the root cause. It was stress. I had just found out about an assignment due tomorrow, and was stressing out.

If you would have asked me a year ago if I was addicted to anything in my life – I would have said no and laughed. Addiction is related to drugs etc. The fact of the matter is I am addicted to internet pornography. I started when I was about 7-8 years old and I have continued this habit to this day. At first it was just curiosity. I remember thinking women having different parts was gross, but yet I couldn’t understand why I was drawn to them. 

_

I discovered hardcore sex at the age of 10. Before that time, I just viewed images and stills of woman in bras/panties. I also masturbated even before I could ejaculate. But with the dawn of filesharing – I was able to view full on sex on my screen. I was amazed at this. My parents were open about sex, but to actually see it happen was a whole different ballgame all together. I felt bad for viewing this material, but that faded fast as curiosity got the best of me. This continued until I was about 18 when I had my first really long term relationship. 

_

It was love first sight with this girl. She was smart, funny, and really beautiful. We hit it off immediately. This air of confidence, I normally didn’t have, was in me when I met her and when I asked her on a date. 

_

We started dating and enjoy each other’s company immensely. We got the same jokes, enjoyed the same things – it seemed perfect. Or so I thought…. 
I lost my virginity to this woman. Before this I was saving for marriage like an old fashioned person, but things just seemed right here. We stayed together for 2 years with a happy relationship. Towards the start of the 3rd year, problems started arising – with me being the problem. I began returning to my old habits of watching porn (not that I had quit, but I started watching more frequently). We even started watching it together. The sex was better than ever. We were learning from the videos on how to do new things in bed. 

_

Reality is a bitch slap in the face sometimes. I thought in my warped mind that it was ok to have a threesome with my gf if we loved each other. That was not me talking – that was my mind on porn. Of course this hurt her a lot, but I was too stupid and blinded by the haze that porn had thrown over my eyes to notice. She was ready to do it for me, because she loved me and I loved her. 

_

Thank God that never came to pass, because I would have regretted it, but the damage was done. She began thinking she was not good enough for me and that I wanted someone else. I loved her and I knew I wanted to be with her, but I had this other side of me that wanted to know what another girl’s vagina felt like. The threesome would have filled both needs. (SUPER SELFISH/STUPID)

_

Fast forward another year- and things just fall apart. We split up for many reasons, but I know my porn habit was one of them. I was young, stupid, and didn’t know a good thing unless it hit me in the face. 

_

I always wanted to say I was sorry to the girl, but I never did due to other circumstances. It turned out we were not right for each other (she did some cheating toward the end of the 3rd year- probably related to my addiction) but I still take away one thing from this to grow from. Porn habits and relationships don’t mix well. You start seeing the world through rose colored glasses and lose sight of what really matters in life. 

_

I just recently found this subreddit and want to fix my life from porn. I took 2 1/2 years to be single and not be with anyone because I was not ready for that. Now I am getting my life back on track and ready to be a man and not dependent on smut to make myself happy or fulfilled.

_

I no longer see women as objects as I once did - there for my pleasure. The funny thing about all this is I don’t miss the sex. What I miss is the bond between a man and women that sex creates (not physically). I miss the feeling of love. I miss the little things like holding hands, small kisses, and just laying with each other under the stars. You lose those feeling when on porn. Do yourself a favor and don’t make the mistakes I made. I am still paying for my mistakes. I ask that you all help me finish this journey to rid myself completely of this horrible thing. I have also become a Christian (even though it isn’t popular on reddit) because it allows me to focus on doing what is right. 

_

TL:DR – I am a porn addict.

I get good looks when I go out. Girls show me love at parties and I've been told many times throughout my life that I'm good looking and sexy. My friends all think I've fucked a bunch of women and when we hangout with girls I'm always the one keeping the conversation interesting and going. Anytime I meet a new group of guys they say, ""Anon, you can probably get any girl you want"" or ""dude I know you get all the chicks, hook us up man"" or something like that. I'm known as a player, as an alpha male and everyone thinks I get the girls with ease. I've always been in decent shape, dressed well and given off an aura of confidence. 

All of that is true, except that I've never slept with a girl in my 23 year life. I've never gotten head or ejaculated with the help of a woman unless she was on my computer screen(or phone). Since I was 12 or 13 I've been masturbating almost daily to fantasies or porn.  Because of this even while lying next to beautiful women (12 or more different ones in the past 4 years), being alone with them sometimes even naked, being offered head or a HJ or even trying to get it up to get some pussy, I've always had ED, and I've always known the reason. I've had 10/10 women licking my limp cock, but to no avail. Time and time again I've been given chances to sleep with or fool around with beautiful women. Time and time again, I go home or we go to sleep disappointed all because I can't stop tugging my junk when I'm alone. 

I am a porn addict and have porn induced ED. This addiction has got to stop. In the past two years it has escalated to new heights with the discovery of websites and forums that share the most abuse, shocking and degrading porn I've ever seen. I suffered from a drug and alcohol addiction while in my first last 4 years of college(switched majors - 2 years left) that took me to rock bottom. During that time I started jerking it multiple times a day and night because the feeling was so intense and amazing while high off weed and amphetamines. The past 3 years were the worst as I was drinking a bunch, smoking a bunch, hiked up all the damn time to counteract the sluggish feeling after drinking and smoking and masturbating like fucking crazy.

I've kicked my other addictions. Weed, ADD meds abuse, Cigarettes, Alcohol, I went cold turkey on all of it. I lost my mind for 2 months because of the withdrawls but I got through it and am a better and stronger man for it. However, my PMO problem skyrocketed as it replaced the highs I gave away. 

My penis is near numb because I couldn't stop masturbating. When I manage to take a week off, sensitivity slowly rises, only to be knocked down again by a vigorous death-grip relapse. This is been on and off for 6 months now. I know all I need to do is stop, and things will heal and I can get back to normal. But the urges are so intense. They override everything I'm thinking about. 

The thing is, the porn is what drove me to those other addictions. Because of porn I was so obssessed with fucking a woman that I'd drink way to often because I was always going out. Then I'd have ED and nothing would happen so I'd have to masturbate that night or morning. I smoked more and more weed because the sexual boost was incredible. Then I smoked to get close to girls that did. I did amphetamines all the time to stay and/or keep up with my studies because I spent the rest of my time chasing tail and jerking it. Then I smoked cigs because I was stressed out. At the end of it all, I'd end up masturbating when I was stressed or when I came down from the amphetamines because the lack of dopamine could be remedied quickest by a strong orgasm. Then my tolerance for all these things increased rapidly and so my use did as well.

During this time I had so many opportunities with women. So many. Sorority girls of all kinds, older women. 18yr old girls fresh out of high school. You name it. Everyone expected me to get em no problem. I'd make up excuses though. The porn had started to eat away at my sex drive and social skills. I slowly started to become more and more of a loner. I started saying I didn't want these women, I wanted to find a good girl that respected her self and didn't sleep with men all willy nilly. 

I skipped parties to have drug infused fap sessions. I cancelled plans to get hiked up on pills and weed so I can fap for hours and feel euphoria all the while. I was late to work, I quit a job, I didn't go to class, and again, lost so many chances with women. So instead of being the outgoing alpha male that pretty much got all he wanted handed to him that I should of been, that I've always been supposed by everyone around me to be. I've wound up a virgin loner that did a bunch of drugs, slowly stopped going out as much and became an internet junkie that spends all day on his laptop looking at women who he'll never meet, never touch and who are sucking the life out of him one wank at a time.

A few of those afore-mentioned ideal women came along, but I didn't commit to them or make moves because I was weird and awkward around them. I know now it was because of the porn and a subconscious fear of my ED that I knew was looming, just waiting to embarrass me and show another girl that I jerk off too much or watch to much porn. Some girls know about that you know. they know it isn't just the alcohol or that you're sleepy, they know that you probably tug your rod too hard and long and too often to porn and that's why even while they're sucking on your cock and playing with your balls that your penis isn't even twitching. 

The story has been the same since middle school. Porn has been cock-blocking me for a decade. I have all the tools and assets, I've literally been running away and awkward and gumpy around women because I spend hours of watching horrible acts of chauvinistic material day in and day out. 

It doesn't make since to watch women getting slapped, abused, degraded for your pleasure hours upon hours a week then turn around and casually talk to a girl like she's a human being. All the while in the back of your mind you just want to tie her up and mentally/physically abuse her until she breaks down and cries. 

It doesn't mesh well that you want to fall into a loving and caring relationship with a women where you both build each other up and inspire one another to be the best you can be when just two hours before you were masturbating to Sissy Hypno videos where you loudly proclaim that you're a slave to cock before switching to a video of a white woman being beaten by a black man because she likes to cry before being viciously fucked. 

The fake world of porn has been silently destroying opportunities in my life that otherwise would have led to amazing things. It's prevented me from being truly happy and helped lead me into a downward spiral into other addictions. I'm done with it as of today. The time and energy I put into addictions and PMO could have had me in a doctorate program right now, benching 250, squating 400, running a 4.5 40, touching rim, dating a beautiful woman, drug free and with a penis with normal sensitivity. 

I'm joining PornFree today and I'm not looking at porn ever again.

I've been lurking and abstaining porn for some time right now and I haven't relapsed since. Maybe I can motivate someone to stay strong as well.

When did I decide to just stop watching porn?
My past sexual encounters were horrible. Nearly every time when I was about to have sex (i.e. penetration) with a woman, my dick went limp. I couldn't understand that.

I stumbled upon /r/nofap , but not fapping was horrible and killed my horniness (is that a word?) completely. I didn't like it. But the idea behind rebooting your brain etc. really thrilled me. I wanted a reboot.

My aim: I want to be a real man, living and thinking in a real world. With real women.

After setting my goal, I really started to reflect about the way I'm watching women and thinking about sex and I realized: My view of everything was wrong, plainly wrong. I had fantasies. Unrealistic fantasies. I decided to finally arrive in the real world, being 25 years old, finishing the University with a Master's degree.

What did I do to reach my aim?

I simply stopped. I broke my routine. No more masturbation with porn.

It sounds simple, maybe too simple but that was it for me.

You need to stop visiting those websites and delete your local porn. Just stop. Don't do what you always did. Browse reddit (SFW), play videogames, go out, engage in physical activities get your mind of porn.

Believe me, you will be incredibly horny after you stop watching porn for a while and you will be hornier than ever if you stop watching porn after a longer time.

But that's not a bad thing, ain't it? You can channel all this energy and horniness into your actions, whether you interact with the females or do some sport.

If you're unable to stand your horniness, just masturbate. Relieve yourself. Don't think about porn. Stay vanilla. Right now, I'm masturbating maybe once or twice a week. Surprisingly that's enough, but dammit I'm feeling wonderful.

Fuck porn, seriously. It ruins ones perception of a huge part of life completely.

I think ive ran the entire spectrum from thinking I needed to become a-sexual, thinking i needed to be completely abstinent, trying to repress my horniness, to making myself think that all women are bad and trying to tempt me when
in the end its me, its all about just quitting porn, thats it. Its that simple. stop watching it. 

Of course theres more to it, your life wont magically transform by just cutting out the porn or fapping (as many in NoFap think its basically NZT).

I've found this site (and NoFap) very helpful.  I'm 44.  I've been in recovery for years including SLAA, and no women ever talk about this stuff there - even one on one.
What it is is that I've been addicted to written porn (I believe this is female porn - ie adult fanfic and literotica) - for years on and off but it escalates when I'm living alone or isolated.
(I'm not talking about Fifty Shades of Grey or lame shit like that either :-)

I'm also addicted to masturbation but I've only just realised that.  I'd never heard of the word 'edging' but it totally describes what happens with erotic lit.  And I just found out from various posts here and other places that that means the dopamine levels stay up for ages.  I think this has actually become harmful to my health.

I have looked at visual/video porn occasionally but I've been so aware of how bad that can be - and harmful in so many ways - that I've managed not to go there very much.  I thought written stuff was less harmful.  Maybe it was, or is, but I have begun to have health problems that are related to written porn and masturbation.  At first I thought it was adrenal fatigue that I've had before, and then I slowly realised that those episodes were all preceded by compulsive sexual fantasy and masturbation.  This last time I've actually had serious pain in the region of my kidney / adrenals / spleen.  One night it was so bad that the next morning I went to the hospital.

I'm beginning to strongly believe it's the buildup, or edging, that is doing this.  Even if I only cum a couple of times over a few hours...the contraction of the abdominal muscles etc...

I can't really imagine being able to stop masturbating for days, weeks and months on end.  I just can't imagine being able to and until a week or so ago I wouldn't even have seen it as possibly necessary.

I am pretty sure with enough prayer and writing etc I can stop going to the written porn stuff or searching stuff.  But I really don't know any women in the program I'd be comfortable talking to about this.  I have a sponsor and I mentioned it to a degree and she goes 'What's fanfiction'....uurgh!!  As if I want to tell her.  There is one close friend, a guy, who's gay, who I might be able to talk to about it.

I've started writing stuff about my solo sex activities that never made it into other 4th step type things.  I'm heaps more comfortable sharing this with men than women, but that's a no-no in the program :-)

thanks...

Oh yeah and why is it that the only posts you see from women on sites are all hardcore Christian?  I'm not and frankly it's a turnoff, I don't relate.  Although I am spiritual and do have a relationship with a Higher Power.

I'd been with a few great girls, but was always worried that I'd meet someone better looking or kinkier, and I'd end up hurting the girl or worse, cheating. I realised this is a very scummy attitude, and hated it, and ended up pushing girls away before any damage was done.

Recently, I started seeing a girl who is awesome. She's hilarious and cute and takes a genuine interest in me. But my commitment issues were kicking in again and I didn't know what to do. After a long think, I decided that porn could be the cause of this, creating unrealistic aspirations for me.

So I started pornfree and Nofap. It was tough at first, but I managed to make it past a week (a big deal for me). While hanging out with the girl I'm seeing, I started to notice how pretty she is and thinking about how good she is for me. I felt really happy just being with her.

Then, in a moment of weakness, I turned to my old vice and watched a few videos. I didn't masturbate, but almost instantly my old mindset came back. I started thinking about whether I should end it to prevent hurting her, and about how I can probably find a girl who is hotter, slimmer and dirtier in bed. The thoughts made me anxious and miserable.

It's been quite startling to see that porn not only prevents me from being happy, but really brings out some ugly, despicable aspects of my personality and turns me into the kind of guy I hate.

I am really going to go through with this now.,31,5,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/pornfree/comments/tz1sr/something_happened_today_i_am_really_going_to_go/,"So, I stumbled across this place a few months ago, and decided that it was pretty cool, but I didn't really take it seriously. You all know the story, it's only told here a million times a day. Well, today I was relapsing (after an 8 day stretch) through one of the Gone Wild subs and ran into something altogether unexpected: somebody I knew from High School.
I really never spoke to her that much, but I was in the school play with her in our senior year and got to know her somewhat. From what I saw, she had an almost non existent self-esteem. She was always worrying about what others would think of her and almost didn't even go on stage. In short, she was shy, almost to a fault.
The girl I saw today wasn't the same girl I knew then. I would have never thought that she would be able to take her top off in front of literally the entire world. Wow, was I wrong.  I had no idea that somebody could change so much in such a short time (the last time I saw her in person would be just over a year ago). What drives a person to do that, to become an object seemingly for the hell of it? Or perhaps she didn't change at all. She always did needed constant assurance. When she did talk, she would just beat herself up, and I always felt obligated to try and make her feel better, even if it was just a smile. She struck me as a perpetually sad person. Perhaps she didn't change, but just needed another person to make her feel like she was worth something? I suppose she is getting it now; just from random weirdos from the internet who are only interested in her body instead of actual friends who care about her. I wonder how many porn stars started out like that: as insecure women who finally got the praise they craved?
This got me to thinking about all the other people we have lusted at after all these years, and it lead me to a realization: that they are actual, real people. Of course, I already knew that, but until today, it never really sunk in. Damn. Those are real people, with lives and a story to tell, and perhaps I saw the beginning of another one today. I really hope not. Regardless, I am done with porn. My hyperactive imagination allowed me to, for the first time, empathize with the people, the real people, on the screen. I am done.  
And Sarah, I really hope that you are done too. I hardly knew you, but I knew you long enough to know one thing: you are better than this. I hope you know that. After all, you know yourself much better than I did. ",,False,,t5_2rglh,False,,,True,t3_tz1sr,http://www.reddit.com/r/pornfree/comments/tz1sr/something_happened_today_i_am_really_going_to_go/,

I'm going to paint a picture of the way acts around work, and the effect he has on people, then relate everything back to Nofap in the end. 

My boss (late 50's early 60's) is literally the creepiest man you will ever meet in your life. The vibes he sends out are extremely off-putting, being in his presence makes people cringe, and people take the stairs so they don't have to be on the same elevator as him. He has obvious social anxiety, which he tries to  cover up with crude humor, but that just makes people even more turned off because he makes really inappropriate comments. It's painful to watch when this man makes a presentation: he sweats and stammers so profusely that it's honestly just sad. As it says in the title, my boss has been caught looking at porn on his work computer twice... and an employee (nobody knows who) submitted a sexual harassment complaint against him. It gets quiet every time he enters a room... There's no trust so every managerial decision he makes is questioned... and basically he's seen as more of a nuisance than a leader. Obviously this would make a person feel very insecure so he resorts to passive aggression and random displays of authority to show that he's the boss. He's left a bad taste in everybody's mouth and I learned that his employment contract will not be renewed for next year, e.g., he got fired. Overall, I think life is pretty miserable for this man but he's such a pervert --so awkward to be around, and so crude that it's hard to extend kindness to him.

Now, why do I share this story? I shared this story because I think I could end up like him if I don't curb my PMO addiction. I've PMO'd in public many times. I have severe social anxiety. And If I'm honest with myself, I've made other people uncomfortable with my sexuality. I think my boss is the end result of what happens when you let your addictions take over your life. Through him I see a glimpse of my future and it motivates me even more to cut this PMO addiction shit out.

After a certain age it's gonna be too late to change certain things. If I don't start making friends now, it's only going to get harder as I get older. I'm only going to get into kinkier/ more depraved porn. And I'm not going to develop the social skills I need to live a full life.When I get to my bosses age, I want to have friends and grandchildren. I want to be the type of old guy that mothers would feel comfortable having their kids around. I don't want to be a pervert...

Our brain rewards us for seeing naked chicks. This is cause, 10,000 years ago the only way you saw a naked chick was a prelude to bonking.  Brain is telling you, way to go, attaboy, keep up the good work, we're gonna father us some offspring.  These days, though, many brains have trouble adapting to getting work done when they can see thousands of hot chick cooches while sitting alone, unshowered, in a basement apartment, eating two-day old pizza.

Same dynamic is in play with video games.  Video games are achievement porn for men.  Video games hijack our animal minds the exact same way porn hijacks our mating behaviors.  Video games give us all Tom Brady, Kobe, or Alexander the Great levels of ass-kissing praise and feeling of conquest -- but without actually accomplishing anything real.

Our brains are built to live in small hunter-gatherer tribes - some evolutionary change since farming - but our underlying hardware is still mostly for hunter-gatherer small tribes.  The male brain is especially designed to try and find some skill the tribe values and get good at it. People complimenting us on the mastery of that skill makes us feel good. Our brain gives us reward signals.  If you got all the positive feedback a video game gives you -- achievement points, xp, gold, etc, etc -- if you got all that in real life from real people then that must mean you are really awesome at something people care about it.

Facebook is relationship porn for women. Same with celebrity gossip.  Celebrity gossip just tricks our minds into thinking we are close friends of the alpha dude and alpha chick. They are sharing their secrets with us, you only do that with close friends. Alphas are the ones in charge of food distribution. Really important to be friends with the tribe leaders if the hunt comes up short or winter is bad. Somebody's gonna starve -- but not you cause you are a secret confidant of tribe leaders Brad Pitt and Beyonce.

They are all hacks of the human mind.  Modern media is mostly a giant brain-hack, mind-fuck.

So all throughout my childhood I had low self-esteem and felt weak and was bullied quite often. I suppressed my feelings of inadequacy and when puberty started things went to shit.

I had been a regular user of hardcore pornography since the age of 11 and as I grew older this descended into the most disgusting things like shemale porn and ""sissy fetish"" porn. For some reason I was able to masturbate to these disgusting fucked-up fantasies and then simply snap back to my normal life when I came. This went on all through-out high school. It didn't help that I had attached myself to the lowest of the low. A bunch of self-hating losers who I called friends. They dragged me down and prevented me from doing fun things like going to parties and meeting girls.

So back in 2012, one day I just triggered when watching Reservoir dogs. I glanced at one of the male characters and thought that's a good looking guy. A harmless thought you might think, after all there's no shame in identifying attractive men. But this started an absolute shit-storm. I panicked and all these suppressed feelings of anxiety and worthlessness came flowing out. I developed a chronic fear of ""being gay"" which plagued me 24/7. There's whole communities online of guys who believe they have HOCD (Homosexual OCD). Whether or not it actually exists or not I can't tell you.

But what I can tell you is that, in a way, I'm glad I had this trigger. It caused me to do some deep soul-searching. Thankfully I have gotten over this stupid fear of being gay. I've never been sexually or romantically attracted to guys in any way. What I did discover was that all this stupid domination/sissy/BDSM/shemale porn was just the manifestation of my feelings of worthlessness as a person. It was a way to express the feelings I suppressed for so long.

So now I've stopped using that utter filth. I'm still quite a heavy user of regular porn (started watching that again as a backlash) but I'm on my way to stopping. Ever since the day I triggered, I've relapsed lighty about 3 times (max I've gone to is shemales and femdom but no sissy crap (thank god) but this is only when I'm at my lowest.)

I'm still suffering from depression which was triggered but I needed it. Since the trigger I have left High school, ditched my pathetic low-life friends (sad I know but there was no need to keep hanging about with these leeches). and I've felt myself become a better person. I've kissed to girls since then! (may not be a big deal to some of you but it was for me!). 

So my advice to anyone trapped watching some form of fetish porn. There's a reason you watch it. Help yourself, the more you watch it the more you sink in and the deeper it gets.

My next steps are to stop using pornography all together and maybe lose my virginity.

I'm not interested in nofap, I think it is healthy to masturbate but I've decided I don't need pornography as an aid.

Why didn't anybody ever tell me the secret?",28,3,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/pornfree/comments/17ofdj/last_night_i_had_my_first_nonporn_o_in_7_years/,"I'm amazed and elated and I owe it to this site. Here's my story:

I've been a porn addict for many years, but after the end of a 12-year relationship (which was undermined by porn) things got worse and porn became my exclusive sex life for a couple years. About a year ago I got into a great new relationship, and I am extremely bummed to confess that I have been FAKING ORGASMS (I'm a man!) because although I can function sexually, I can't cum without porn. In my old relationship I could cum by thinking about porn, but now I have to have it in actual view.

Until I came upon this pornfree subreddit. You guys have been invaluable in educating and inspiring me about this fucked up addiction, which leads me to the idea that may be changing my life. It came in the form of a casual comment in one of the posts: that achieving orgasm while having sex with another person is about the physical sensations of the act itself, not about some fantasy that is going on in your mind. WOW! That hit me right between the eyes. I'm kind of an introvert and very much at home in my own mind, so fantasy has always been easy for me. 

So after reading that, which was on my 7th day without porn or fapping, I decided to not even try to fantasize to orgasm with my boyfriend (I'm gay), but to just concentrate on the physical sensations of the sex in real time. It was a whole different experience, and I got to a place of heat and intensity that I hadn't experienced in years. And then, viola! I had one of the best orgasms I can ever remember having. No porn, no fantasizing, just riding the wave of actual sex and actual sensation with an actual person. Who knew!!? It seems so simple but it had literally never occurred to me in my entire sexual life. I'm both embarrassed and extremely happy. 
 
I feel like I have a new lease on my sex life: no porn, no fantasy. I am very grateful to the man who brought it up, and to all of you with whom I feel a real bond of support here.  Yee haw!

That pit of your stomach desire to have sex.  Well, 2 nights ago, I got that feeling again.  My first reaction was to try and quell it, but then I had a thought... what if lust is not a bad thing?  What if the emotion of lust is alright?  What if I need to learn how to channel this emotion into something useful, rather than just pushing it down, hoping that it won't resurface?!  Anyone reading this should know that feeling of panic when our minds become sexually aroused.  We get ready for the fight of our lives and just hope and pray that we can get through it all without relapsing.  And so for the last 6 or so years (whenever I actually tried to break the addiction)  I would attempt to force down the lustful emotions and keep my composure. 

But in the early morning hours of the new year, I did not try to force anything down.  I let myself feel lust, I let it wash over me, but... NOT ONCE did I feel like looking at porn.  Instead, I wrote.  I wrote about what I was feeling, and I wrote about my future wife and how I want her to be the focus of my lust, and I wrote about my pains of the past and how I would never fall for that same mistake again.  I wrote about how exiting this feeling of lust is, I wrote about how much drive it gave me to pursue the woman of my reality, the one in real life, not behind some wall of glass and color, a fabricated dream.  

And now I feel more alive than ever before.  More exited than I ever did, even when I was little, waiting up into the night on Christmas Eve, all that young exited desire for toys has no comparison to the amazing.... and PURE desire that I have for that real woman.  Although I have not yet completed the first 90 days of my journey, I think that the watershed moment has come and gone.  I'm a new person, the deed is done, the first victory won.  So now I build up my walls, placing guards on the ramparts, and wait, wait for the enemy to come so that I might meet him face to face and dash him to pieces upon my strong defenses.

I am going to stop smoking, fapping and looking at porn all at the same time.  Nothing is going to deter me.  I just moved to a new city. I just started a new job. Now, I am going to start a new era in my life by taking back the control of my mind that I gave over to these three habits.

Some may say I am unwise. Some may say I'm crazy. I am crazy. I am just crazy enough that this will work. 

There will be no relapsing. My will power controls my impulses. Failure is not an option.  Time to be awesome and exercise, read those books I have meant to read, and take myself to the next level in my own writing.

1344110735.0,24,self.pornfree,xom3q,56 Days Free - I am going to tell you how I keep on going and how I can now take other big steps.,27,3,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/pornfree/comments/xom3q/56_days_free_i_am_going_to_tell_you_how_i_keep_on/,"Dear readers, this is gonna be long. (I made a **TL,DR** at the end) My counter says I have been pornfree for 56 days and it went like a breeze. But it wasn't always like that.

I had been trying to quit porn for about a year, failing week after week. I would constrain myself for 3-4 days but then resort to porn after a rough day. I would tell myself that I would only watch for the enjoyment, from an artistic point of view I would say, but I would have wasted hours before I would give in to my erection. I cycled like this for months.

I was the kind of person that is all suave and seductive in his mind but awkward and scared in reality. I was not bad looking and was not that awful with girls, but I was not getting any dates after my last break-up. I had started working out about a year ago and my body was way fitter, my confidence was higher than ever. Still my personal relationships were unsatisfactory at best. Not just with girls, whenever I was with my friends or at work I had this constant feeling of something was not right. This feeling I realized was elemental to my addictive mind.

I watched Your Brain on Porn. Because of the work I do and my interests I know quite a lot about neuroscience. Needless to say that guy has a point. Now consider guys like me, in their early twenties. We have had computers since we were kids, and soon after got internet in our homes. Even before we discovered porn we had been hooked up to this box. Hours of games, music, videos. It is only now I realize that I was way too much attached to my computer. I taught myself up from basic windows capabilities to basic programming, to hardware stuff, reading from online forums, trial and error, and countless hours of being one-on-one with the machine. My computer was almost alive in my eyes. What does this have to do with porn? Read on if you can.

I have seen my friends watch porn on television, look at it on magazines, none of that would stir anything in me. This might be different for other people, but I only got stimulated from online porn. I thought deep into my addiction, I realized the good and bad memories are intermingled. I had fun with my computer when I was a kid, real fun, playing games with my buddies, being amazed by every new thing I learned online. I also noticed what psychologists call cues. If you see a box of chocolate every time you do a drug, after some time you start craving when you see a box of chocolate. With me, I would begin to touch myself if I spend more than 5-10 minutes studying or doing work on my laptop.

This made me feel bad, very bad. Not just sad, but lost. My stomach would wrench and I would not be able to look at myself in the mirror. ""Boy, this is fucked up"". And yes, boy. I could not allow myself to call myself a man, cause I felt nothing like it. Not only this, I masturbated to so much inapproprite stuff, to friends I cared about, and people I respected, and some disgusting porn, that I slowly and slowly started hating the act of masturbation. I had swept aside the guilt that comes with masturbation, but this was self-despise from having become this terrible person, from having stained good memories of childhood fun with an act that made me grow into a person I never would have wanted.

So this is some months back, I have in my mind to quit fapping, to become better person. In the meantime I soulsearch. I want to be this better person. Someone that can set an example. How can you be that arrogant, you may ask? You think you are better than the rest of us? YES, fucking YES. How? Read on, I have not told you anything yet.

I hate people. And that is where I found my turning point. Not everybody, just every deceitful person, and there are so many. I am obsessive. No OCD, that is different. But obsessive. I am obsessive about truth. Those of you who have seen ""Route 66"", there was one guy that is obsessive about truth. He gets mad at a beggar who holds a sign that reads ""will work for food"". He tells the beggar to clean the car for an apple, but the beggar is like wtf, asks why he can't just give him money. The guys says something to the effect of ""your sign says will work for food, there is work (pointing at the car) and there is food (showing the apple). That is how I am. Whenever someone lies, cheats I get angry. Whenever someone smiles at my face when I know inside they feel the opposite I get angry. When someone collects money for a charity and steals the money I get furious. When a friend tells me ""relax, I will do X for you tonight"" and it has been 3 days and he is smirking about it, I am no longer his friend. When people lie to themselves I try to help them out, show them how they are contradicting and how that is making them unhappy. If they change I respect them, if not I pity them. Above all, I want to be nothing like them. I want to be different from them. If they hurt people because they have their own problems, I want to be Zen enough to not hurt anyone. If they go home and jerk-off to their crush, being the coward they are, I don't want to ever jerk off. I want something to set me apart.

I finally stopped viewing porn. It was 56 days ago from today, I had to check the counter to remember when it was. Here is my first advice. **Do not wait until a magical day to start PornFree, there is none** I had tried New Year's, and no. The first of the month, no. Until this exam then no more, no. All it did was give an excuse to watch porn until that time. I was just putting it off. So if you are ready, stop now. NOW, is when. And forget about it. That is who you are now, a person who does not do porn. Not someone who is pornfree for 3 days, or 2 weeks, but for as long as you exist.

Alas your body changes slowly, still slowly does your mind. You are arm-wresting decades of award-circuits, hormonal balances, a life-long of natural instincts, all laid down in your foundation. Sorry but you are fighting the very person you have been all your life. It is not difficult as biologically we are made to change every second in reflection to our environment. It is difficult as you are only as strong as your will until your brain starts adapting. This means you will be fighting relapses. The thought will pop in your mind now and then. How did I fight every single one of those thoughts without cold-showers or push-ups (these are good ways to fight off an erection btw, I used them in the past) these last two months? I told myself **I will never go back to the kind of person I used to be** Never. It scares me so much I turn white at the thought of being that disgusting, no-good, pathetic boy who is afraid of life, lacking confidence and willpower to accomplish anything and bound for failure. Because yes, now that I have opted out of porn, I do not turn on my computer unless it is absolutely necessary for work or communication. 

Sometime into Pornfree, I was feeding my hungry award-circuits with online games and Reddit and YouTube and whatnot. It is correct to say putting those softer ""drugs"" in the place of porn helped sooth my mind in the meantime. But I have also said I will say no to anything that hinders me on my challenge to be this better man. I have a smartphone so it helps me read news, check email, and do other vital stuff without turning on my laptop. And I don't want to spend hours on Reddit or Youtube. I have learned a great deal on these websites, seen amazing pictures, videos, read stories that tell great life lessons. But I don't want any of it. Simple because too much time is spend looking at this LCD screen that could be spent with people, in real life, on Earth.

From now on if I want to learn something, I will read a book. Maybe for movies I will need my computer, or for online shopping or printing something out. But no idle minutes. I want to cherish life. **We get good only at what we spend time on.** My work is important to me, I will spend more time for work-skills. There are people that matter to me, so I will spend time on my people-skills. 

But you said you hate lots of people? Why do you want to be a better person in a world full of despicable people? Today I am a single man but I hope to start a family down the line, and have children. There is where I can end all my arguments. One day I will be responsible for raising children, and they will be watching me, studying who I am, absorbing all that into who they are. I don't want them to absorb lazy, week, dishonest-to-himself character from me. **I want my child to have an example of a successful, strong, virtuous person in his life when he looks at me, and asks me how what I spent my earlier years on.**

With these in mind I have not relapsed. I let go of internet addictions. I eat healthy, I work-out. I balance work and friends. I am better with girls, thought still not where I want. I am slowly changing in my brain. I will quit Reddit today (will respond to this thread for a few days on my phone as the last thing I do in case someone reads all this). I will fucking choose life.

**The TL,DR**

**1) Do not wait for a magical day to start the change, it only gives you an excuse to continue. Simply stop, NOW**

**2) What should stop you from relapsing should not be a counter of how many days it has been. It should be that you never want to go back to the person you were, that pathetic version of you.**

**3) Do it all for your children or other loved ones. One day your kid will look up to you and you will face questions about choices in life you made and he/she will be copying who you are growing up. Be a better original.**

**4) Do not be just pornfree, be free from anything that holds you back. Fast-food, internet, wrong friends, too much TV, anything that harms you.**

**5) Soulsearch. Your addiction to porn is not an entity on its own. There is a reason behind it, think about it. When do you crave? What is always there when you do porn? Do you have other addictions? Define the enemy you will take on.**",,False,,t5_2rglh,1344144234.0,,year1,True,t3_xom3q,http://www.reddit.com/r/pornfree/comments/xom3q/56_days_free_i_am_going_to_tell_you_how_i_keep_on/,

I took I hiatus from reddit because, quite frankly, I couldn't handle having the temptation of porn in a search and a click away. But, I've managed nine days, and while I'm feeling rather tempted right now, I think I can handle it.

A lot has happened since I re-started nine days ago. I've discovered window washing as a summer day and have been bringin home the bacon, and got a really sucky job as a bus boy (I'm not sure if I'm going to keep it during the school year, my schedule is already death)

How this relates to me being pornfree is in two parts, one I'm terrified to stay not busy and in my house, and I finally got motivated to find a job(s). I really do think not doing porn had an influence on the motivated part, as my pre-porn tendency to try to always be doing something is coming back. Rather than laying on the couch fantasising or hours of hunting the hottest pics, I'm trying to accomplish something with my life.

This in its self has taught me a lot. In previous pornfree streaks, I've waited for magical changes to happen in my life with not effort on my part, that things would just happen. While being pornfree and not fapping does that a tiny bit, the rest is up to me what I do with my improved life. 

So, in effect, to fight this porn addiction, I'm going live. I'm going to put myself out there, take risks and it all, and just work my butt off. 

Its up to us what we do with our pornfree lives, lets freaking kick trash.

1: I am a normal (teen) guy, with a normal set of junk.
2: Women are downright beautiful (not just for their parts, more on that below)
3: Porn throws 1 and 2 out of the window.
Porn glorifies the absurdities of sex, in general. Porn automatically assumes that you have a massive penis the size of a babe's arm, and that you have a 6 pack and biceps that could make Popeye cry. Oh, and if you don't, you're not normal. You're below average :C
But you don't notice this while watching porn, no, not at all. In fact, its the opposite: this is normal, watching this is normal, and ill be damned if i cant do it too.
This ruins you, whether you realize it or not.
The main thing ive noticed after quitting porn is that I am more comfortable with myself, my friends, strangers, parents, women...I'm just Mr. Frosty.
There's a certain freedom in being able to say ""oh hai NOPE"" when porn pops up on your screen, or better yet, being able to appreciate a girl for her entire being.
Porn would have you believe that unless a girl has size D or larger boobs, she is not worth a glance. Well that's really interesting, because excuse me and general anatomy, but size D boobs (except in very rare circumstances) do not occur on women with size 0 waists.
But porn would like you to think that.
As you quit porn and start life, you will find what you've been missing, whatever that may be...and most of all, you will gain back your lost self, or maybe find your self thats been shoved away in a corner because porn has captained your body for however long.
I found a heart full of love, love i couldnt even imagine.
What will you find?
You have nothing to lose, and possibly everything to gain.

Fapping too.  I'm grown up now, I haven't ""outgrown"" either--now I realize that this isn't something that's outgrown in the same way as cartoons with crime-solving dogs and food like Spaghetti-O's are.

Now I have a wife and a daughter.  My wife likes to watch porn with me.  That's great, and I wish I could just do that, just like I wish I could have one cigarette.  Since the tube sites especially, I can spend hours and hours.  I have spend literally over a thousand dollars on memberships.  I lied about them constantly to my wife.  I'm ashamed at how _much_ I have, even though she likes it too, I hide it from her.

And now it's costing me time for my hobbies.  It's worse than porn getting in the way of stuff that I have to do, i.e. work, it's getting in the way of stuff that I _want_ to do, even more than I want porn.  C.S. Lewis said, paraphrased greatly from Screwtape Letters, that the way to destroy somebody's life is to ensure that they are doing neither what the want to do nor what they should do.  That's what porn is doing to me.

Stuff I've given up cause I abused every one of them: tobacco, marijuana, alcohol, benzos, z-drugs (ambien etc), hallucinogens, whatever.  4 of those 5 had serious withdrawals, two of them requiring medical intervention, one of those interventions being inpatient.  So I know about cravings and I know how strong I am capable of being if there are people around me to share the experience with. Maybe that's here.  And the 51 percent is how I gave up everything else too--never did I all the way want to give anything up, I just got to want to quit more than I wanted to not.

**But I have found the loophole as well:**

There are no emotions involved in masturbating to a screen. At least not if you distance yourself enough.

That's the key to successful relationships as well:

1354641272.0,22,self.pornfree,149pd2,Review Your Battle Plan Today,28,6,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/pornfree/comments/149pd2/review_your_battle_plan_today/,"Trying to beat a problem with pornography can be very much like a battle. A lot of things lead you back to the porn, seemingly innocent things sometimes. You have to think about how serious you are and adjust your rules of engagement accordingly.  

If you're in a fight for your life, how close are you willing to let things go to actual pornography? Be careful around the things that have historically lead to you watching pornography later.

If the last five speeding dump trucks heading towards your guard post have been vbieds, when do you shut it down? When you see the whites of the guy's eyes? I've found that what helps me be protected is that when I see a dump truck coming (symbol here!) I NOPE it out immediately.

Maybe it seems unreasonable to deny myself looking at women when I'm out shopping, or to avert my eyes when a Victoria's Secret commercial comes on. Maybe that seems really drastic and unnecessary.

But the people that feel that way aren't the ones who have been hit by explosion after explosion, whose lives are on the line. My life is on the line when it comes to pornography.

I have been casualty free for a long time now, but I'm still keeping watch - and I GUAR-OWN-TEE you that if I see a dump truck speeding towards me, I shut that down as far out as possible.  Do all approaching vehicles contain my impending death?  Will every video that's a little too ""sexy"" lead me immediately back to pornography?  It's the overall discipline and mindset that will.  Lax attitudes get good people wounded every day in this sub-reddit.  

People lose girlfriends, wives, families, jobs, self respect, self control, and sometimes even more over this stuff.  Those are some major casualties. It's addictive and sometimes people can't even trust their own minds around it. My advice is that you have to wipe out every pornographic, semi-pornographic enemy. If it looks like it might be carrying a grenade, or grow up to carry a grenade, or feed someone that will one day carry a grenade - wipe it all out. Nuke it from orbit, it's the only way to be sure, that kind of thing. Don't leave one stone upon another. Total desolation, annihilation.

That's the way I've won. I give no quarter in my mind to the enemy. ""Awww but it's just a youtube lady with low cleavage teaching math, what's the harm in that?"" That's called fraternizing with the enemy. It looks harmless but that video's cousin isn't so harmless. And once your hormones start buzzing you weaken your resolve, until soon the part of your brain that wants porn can beat you with both hands tied behind its back!

Do you want to make it home?  Are you willing to do whatever it takes?  Then don't underestimate the enemy that you face.  Stop letting stupid things lead you into pornography's ambush. 

1) Discipline your mind.  You set out a course for your life, and you don't let your environment or momentary urges distract you.  There's a reason the military focuses on stuff like shiny shoes, and standing at rigid attention.  If you allow yourself to entertain certain thoughts because ""You're strong"" - what is going to happen to you when you're weak - on a business trip or all alone?  If you don't build up that discipline when you're strong, how are you going to be able to control yourself when you're in the thick of it?

2) Don't underestimate your enemy.  If it seems like pornography almost has a thinking, plotting, scheming and patient mind behind it, that's because it does.  Yours.  Your enemy has taken down mightier men than you.  Where they failed, you will succeed - but not if you don't fear and respect the power of pornography.  Rewatch YBOP.  

3) Fight FOR Something.  We each have our reasons.  Never forget what you're fighing for.  Imagine what success looks like and feels like.  

4) Nature Abhors a Vacuum.  What happens when you wipe out one corrupt regime?  If you do nothing, maybe it gets replaced by another one.  Ok, so you're now free from pornography.  What to do with all of that literal saved energy, time, and motivation?  Replace the empty space with something worthwhile.  Pornography isn't our life.  It's in the way of the life we'd rather have.  If we fight only to avoid pornography, what purpose does the warrior have once it's gone?  Instead fight for something, replace pornography, and fight for the life that pornography stands in the way of.  It's an identity/perspective thing.  Our lives don't revolve around pornography, OR EVEN FIGHTING IT.  Our lives are focussed on something bigger/more than that, something we'll still have to fight for after pornography is defeated.

5) Call On Allies.  If it looks like you can't win the war alone, or without taking major casualties to your relationships/life/self/soul, you need to consider getting help from others.  Yes, you'd hoped to do it on your own.  But wouldn't you rather win, even if it meant not doing it on your own?  There are professional counselors, support groups, religious groups/leaders, and our families.  A wife/girlfriend who already is aware of your problem may be the solution, not the problem.  The problem is the pornography.  Perhaps having her stand beside you while you're on patrol would be just the thing you need to keep you more alert, and watchful.  If you've waged war for a long time with no success?  Bringing an ally into your efforts might just be the game changer that breaks the stalemate and leads to permanent victory.  Consider it.

I have taken my own advice above, and although I'd had a problem with pornography for many years, I have been whole, and well, and avoided pornography for so long that I consider myself ""clean"" in every way.  HOWEVER, I do believe that pornography has my number.  It has me dialed in.  If I stop being vigilant, I don't fool myself to think that it wouldn't have me again.

Will you stand with me?  No more restricted rules of engagement that makes us treat pornography with kid gloves, telling us that only pornography itself is the problem, and that other lustful but ""not technically pornography"" videos/images/thoughts are not to be considered combatants.  The hell they aren't!  That's PRECISELY how the enemy attacks us.  That's their modus operandi!  That's their principal means of infiltration.

You need to expand your rules of engagement accordingly, because if you limit yourself to simply ""avoiding pornography"" - you're in for a long and very bloody campaign.

Just reflecting on the fact that my use of Porn/Fapping is really more of a symptom of (primarily) boredom and (secondly) low self esteem.  I'm fighting a pretty good war against porn and fapping, but it doesn't change the fact that there are some major unresolved issues with my life overall.

The comment's been made before, and I agree with it, that going pornfree and NoFap is really just a way of addressing the cause through treating the symptoms.  It's no use spending your whole life fighting temptation in front of a computer (irrespective of how successful you are), when what you really should be doing is building a more fulfilling life in other areas.  

Listen to all of the success stories and tips that people write on here - new fitness programs, ramped up social interaction, cleaning the house, taking up new hobbies, etc. etc.  Even more than some iron willpower, the creation of a fulfilling and meaningful life outside of PMO seems to be the surest way to kick this thing.

It's something I've tried in the past and failed, lasting anywhere from 3-5 days.  This time, however, I think I'm ready to commit to a pornfree lifestyle... and it was this exercise that seemed to open up my eyes.

Open up a spreadsheet program and start a new spreadsheet.  Set up two columns.  

Column A is going to be porn/faps.  Think of all the things you've fapped to/watched/liked for as long as you can remember.  For some this may span many, many, many years.  Try to keep track of the oldest one somehow.  Every model, website, actress, torrent, dvd, whatever.

Column B is going to be all the great fun memories you have of your life that span as far back as that oldest memory from Column A.  Maybe you'll have that summer you spent in a different city.  Maybe you'll have all those fun times out with your friends, or that really great person you dated and got kind of serious with for a year.  Did you graduate from University with a respectable GPA?  Put that shit down!

What I found was that my porn list was far easier to brainstorm and far more vivid than the memories I had.  In fact, the porn list *doubled* my list of memories, with both lists spanning back to about 2004.  It shows that my life has really just been a blur of events between porn sessions.

Now, I don't know about you but to me that's no way to live.  I don't want to look back on my 20s as the time I spent frying my brain on porn.  I want a life with some damn memories.

So all in all, just get up and go do something. harness that energy and never get too focused on the urge, just look around and do stuff, it'll take your mind off of the urge faster than you think.

1346372641.0,25,self.pornfree,z3wd5,Some important realizations for anyone here.,27,2,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/pornfree/comments/z3wd5/some_important_realizations_for_anyone_here/,"Hey guys and girls, along my journey there are a couple of realizations that I've had to come to terms with, but they really helped me get through, so I think they will hold value for anyone here.

1. **The world will not quit with you.**  The majority of the internet is pornography, that is a fact. It wont change simply because you don't want to see it anymore. A lot of great movies have nudity in them. That's not going to change. You are going to have to learn to watch these movies without them causing temptation to relapse. Sex sells! Sex marketing is the most powerful technique out there, and it will always be out there. You're going to have to live with that.

2. **There are going to be times on your journey that are just going to fucking suck!** You will question whether or not its worth it. You will question why you're even doing it. You will want to go back to it. You will probably get stressed out and consider this as a healthy outlet. But you are going to have to acknowledge these feelings, but not follow them.You will get through the hard times, just be persistent. 

3. **The world does not owe you something just because you gave up porn** If you're expecting the 90 days to come and you magically get a girlfriend or a boyfriend... Think again. It doesn't work like that. You have to get out of the house, be more social, be bolder! Doing PornFree is a FANTASTIC step down the right road, but its only a step and it wont get you all the way to where you want to go.

4. **You can't leave here unsuccessful** If you are here, and you've invested yourself in this, you can't leave. Think about it, whats going to happen to your willpower if you do leave? Whats going to happen to your sense of control over your own life? RIGHT NOW you are testing the most crucial aspect of your ability to be happy. To fail that... Jeez I can't imagine going on without it. Whether you're here for 90 days or multiple years, if you've decided this is what you want, you better get it.

5. **90 days is not the end.** Even now I have urges to go back to it. I still miss it at times. But those voices are weak, and growing weaker. 90 days is a milestone decided by this community, it doesn't mean you've gotten better, and it doesn't mean you can't relapse.

6. **Its worth it!** It really is. Knowing you can control yourself, and the powerful urges you have is invaluable! It fucking feels great! It really does!  Its said 70% of men admit to watching porn, Id say quite a few lie about that too. It feels powerful to be in this minority.

1376676994.0,23,self.pornfree,1ki3cx,My best mental trick for fighting cravings,23,0,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/pornfree/comments/1ki3cx/my_best_mental_trick_for_fighting_cravings/,"Thought exercise (or written):  Consider the progression of your addiction.  Look for escalation and where you've tried unsuccessfully control it.  Now project all the way forward what will happen through the rest of your life if you continue escalating and unsuccessfully controlling it.  Given your past escalation and lack of ability to restrain it, what evidence at all is there to suggests it won't continue to escalate?

The next part may sound dramatic, yes.  But the escalation in my past is REAL.  And remember that addiction escalation doesn't *permanently* stop at any convenient, before-worse-consequences threshold.

For me, here's my future:  My girlfriend will leave me.  My social skills will continue to deteriorate first with girls and then also with non-addict men.  I will be unable to achieve my potential in my career because of social problems.  I will have no energy for other pursuits as porn takes more and more of my time, and fail to meet my potential in many ways.  Eventually I'll escalate to the point where I'll generate a sexual harassment complaint, and I'll ruin my ability to contribute at all to my career of choice.  My escalation will continue to where I'm perpetually lonely and existentially alone.  I'll seek out self-harming things: massage parlours, anonymous sex, prostitution, harrassment, stalking, illegal porn.  STIs and legal risk will ensue.  Eventually my actions will be impossible to hide from any friends and family I may have left.  I'll eventually be jailed and permanently marked as a sexual offender, alone with no chance of a future.

My only option there at the end, alone, addicted, trapped, and jailed, will be recovery or death.

But really, that's *the same choice I have to make right now*.  Recovery or death.  If I don't choose now to pursue recovery, I'll escalate, my addiction will fester and grow, and sooner or later I'll end up there with no choices besides recovery and death.  Only at that point so many possibilities for my future will have been eliminated.  So many bridges burnt.  It will be much harder to choose recovery, I may end up choosing death.

With this perspective, I have no choice but to choose recovery now.

So with every craving I remind myself, indulging that craving is a step closer to the end.  Me slamming my own head against the wall to liquefy my brain.  Indulging the craving reinforces it, escalates it, leads down dark path, and is killing me.  When I'm faced with a craving, my options are **recovery or death**.  It makes it easier to choose to do that difficult thing I *know* is better for me, whatever it is.

1375353133.0,25,self.pornfree,1jhi8g,She was known as one of the world's hottest porn stars but now she has turned her back on the adult industry that left her suicidal and embraced God.,39,14,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/pornfree/comments/1jhi8g/she_was_known_as_one_of_the_worlds_hottest_porn/,"**The link is below in the TL;DR section. But NSFW for guys who may get triggers.**

I used to hear a lot about all this church organizations that turn pornstars towards God in the hope that they may leave their dark past behind for a much more happier and fulfilling future. While I never doubted them, it was hard for me to really see them as something that could actually help pornstars at a large rate because the ones that they did help out, were always ones I've never heard about, they were not the famous kind of pornstars you could google and find loads of videos or pages about them.

Until today that is. So here I was, just deciding to check out this pornstar that was one of my favs on youtube. And all of a sudden one of those videos on the sidebar caught my eye and it was about what the title of my post suggests. I mean I was ecstatic. I was always silently hoping one of these big name pornstars might be persuaded to come out of the industry but was always skeptical because I thought it would be too hard for them to be convinced to leave after many years of making a name for themselves and indulging in that type of lifestyle. I mean I loved dreaming of the fact that while me and the rest of us at nofap seriously attempted to stop our porn, so did our favourite pornstars. I mean hardcore fans of her will definitely have a think about porn because for her to quit, something must be seriously wrong. She's young, she's 26, she's got her all life ahead of her!

So man, this is a major victory for the good side! And seeing that video, while there was some triggers as seeing her reminded me of all those crude scenes I had seen her been subjected to, those old lustful thoughts were overpowered by the sheer joy I felt for her.

I mean for the first time, I looked at her smile and instead of those crude thoughts I used to think about her, I said to myself ""Wow, she's beautiful. She's really beautiful.""

Just thought of sharing this with you guys.

Let me preface this post with a bit of my background. I'm 15 (16 this year), and discovered pornography about four years ago. Since then, it has been strengthening its grips on my life. My situation wasn't as bad as many of yours were, but I was consistently using shock sites and [Spoiler](/s ""motherless"") to satiate m increasingly sick urges. This started to take a toll on me, and I finally took action in late September when I stumbled across /r/NoFap, and shortly read up on the subject. From there, I came to /r/PornFree, and shortly decided that this was a necessary change in my life. I officially started on the 1st of October last year, and have been thankfully clean since. 

Your mileage will certainly vary, depending on your situation and how deep you were into the addiction. I was quite lucky in that I caught the problem early, before it could manifest into more of an issue that it already was. If you're starting out now, one thing that you mustn't dwell on is the deletion of your existing collection. It has to be done immediately and without thought, otherwise you are almost guaranteed to fail. To succeed in this challenge, however, you MUST get out into the outside world and start socialising. This, along with minimising your Internet usage where possible, is key to doing well in this challenge.

If you're thinking of joining /r/PornFree, my advice is to just do it. You lose nothing and gain so much that the only way to truly express it is to experience it for yourself. Also, if you're thinking of joining /r/NoFap as well, bear in mind that where /r/NoFap is a challenge with benefits, /r/PornFree is a necessary lifestyle alteration that will change you for the better.

I initially ran across /pornfree after doing a little research as a results of the Your Brain on Porn TEDx video. Previously I had never really considered a porn addiction to be a big thing, assuming it only affected a small amount of people. In fact I would usually get a chuckle out of the billboards that sported ""Are you addicted to porn?"" headlines (though this may be because they are super cheesy). I have always been able to pick up and drop things like alcohol and cigarettes with no issues or withdrawals. As such, I never would have considered being addicted to porn. After doing research on the dopamine effects that porn has, I was convinced that it would be a good idea to stop my consumption.

It may be a little TL;DR, but here are some of the things I have experienced in the short time I have been participating.

First off, I read a lot about the different withdrawal symptoms of quitting porn and they appear to be quite extensive. Surprisingly, I have felt none of these effects despite using internet porn every other day for 9 years (I am 24 now, you do the math). There are likely a few reasons for this, one that I attribute to be the largest is that I have decided to not feel guilty about my habit. I accept that it was an erroneous and destructive decision to use it, but feeling guilt about it will only make it harder. The second part that I believe has really helped is that I am sexually active, and that area has had its own array of effects.

The details of my sexual activity is a story for another time and subreddit, but for the sake of the topic I will share that I am currently sexually active with a few women. In my encounters in the short time since I have stopped porn I have already noticed some differences. First and foremost is my interaction with the partner I am with. Even just being in the same room as them I have been feeling more emotionally engaged with them. When things start to get intimate my lust for them is on an entirely different level from before. As things progress, without getting too detailed, I can simply *feel* them better. It has been a much more pleasurable experience. The downside is that I have noticed a significant decrease in the time I last (previously I lasted forever), but I am guessing this will get better once it's not such a shock to the system.

I have also noticed some immediate benefits outside of sex. For a long time I have been dealing with several issues, including a severe lack of energy, lack of attention span, and what is sometimes referred to as brain fog. I have been medicated for this for a while and the medication has really helped me to be on a normalish level. After quitting porn it was same as usually for about a week, then after that I started feeling a euphoric amount of energy. It felt like I was suddenly in over drive. Since then my energy levels have been much higher, my focus is a little bit better, and more distinctively my mood is a lot better. I have also noticed a difference in how complete strangers react to me. I have always been used to some attention as I am a rather tall and athletic college student, but this past week I have noticeably been getting a lot more random people giving me the look. One day it was enough that one of my female friends commented on it. I have nothing else to attribute this to other than what quitting porn has changed in my mind, because I have literally changed nothing else in my life as of yet.

Sorry for the huge post, I just felt like sharing my experience so far. TL;DR I didn't feel many side effects, my sex life is a better, and it's helped with some medicated issues. At this point I have no desire to go back to porn.",,False,,t5_2rglh,False,,month7,True,t3_16xr71,http://www.reddit.com/r/pornfree/comments/16xr71/decided_to_experiment_with_pornfree_and_ive_had/,

3) I lose sleep because of it.

4) I get behind on work/do a mediocre job on days when I look at it.

5) It still has the power to ruin my erection during sex.

6) None of the porn I look at is particularly sex-positive. It's always either moneyed exploitation or secretly uploaded by terrible boyfriends. The women in those videos did not consent to me seeing them naked. Really, it's a form of rape.

7) Every time I click around in porn sites, people make tiny amounts of money. I am taking part in a commerce that I completely disapprove of.

8) It makes desire into something that emanates from me into the world instead of being what it should be, which is a commingling of slight ideas among/between people. Flirting becomes a desire to fuck instead of a satisfying and fun social encounter.

I'm not like most of you here, it seems, in that I'm married. Sex with the missus is, well, sex with the missus. 20+ years with the same woman. Porn was my variety. At 43, porn is about the only way I'm going to see a 20-something naked again. That, my friends, is a lot.

I quit porn because of some ED issues and the icky feeling of how extreme my tastes had become--what I just viewed and PMO'd to was extreme. The same as many of you.

Did I have improved erections? No doubt. Did I see women differently? Yes, sure. Was I aroused more easily and naturally? Yes. All, yes, to the benefits you've all heard about. 

But I just began to doubt what it meant to me. So, what, I'm off porn. My wife didn't seem to want sex any more now than she did then. So, now that I've done it--my first relapse--now that I've caved to the pressure and got what I thought had been missing, and achieved the result, how do I feel? Like a bit of a failure. 

Maybe relapsing and seeing how unmagical it was and how icky deja vu as my mind settled back into those old deep ruts again, again, again. Maybe the relapse is part of the journey. A necessary side trip to answer the question--is it worth it--that starts to form after a few weeks. For me, it seems, the answer is yes. 

So, friends, I'm back to day one. The good news is that, after convincing myself otherwise, I am reaffirmed at not wanting it in my life. It was shallow.

1376239350.0,21,self.pornfree,1k5feu,My quit so far - ~3 months without PMO,23,2,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/pornfree/comments/1k5feu/my_quit_so_far_3_months_without_pmo/,"I used to keep a regular journal but I haven't written in a while. Today I felt the need to write, and I've never posted anything to pornfree so I thought making a post would be a good outlet.

I'm not sure how long now it's been since I've looked at porn; probably about two weeks now. But it's been about three months since I've PMO'd, or masturbated at all. And I can count on one hand the number of times that I have looked at porn during this period.

For me the problem has always been PMO. I'm not thrilled that I've looked at porn a few times in the past few months, but looking at porn alone never caused me to feel shameful in the way that PMOing does. Looking at porn alone never wrecked my next three days because of how guilty, worthless, and hopeless I felt.

To give context, I'm 27 now, and have been looking at porn and masturbating to it since I was 14 or so (ever since I got my first computer). Thankfully I never progressed into really ""heavy"" or extreme stuff. My tastes have always been tame, at least compared to what I know some other people are into. I've tried to quit hundreds of times. The longest stretch I've ever had was 23 days, which was over last Christmas/New Year. And before that my longest was 17 days, after the prior New Year.

Looking at porn isn't a good thing, obviously, and I know that for many people here, just looking is bad enough for them. I think each person identifies what their addiction is for them, and what a relapse means for them. I'm not trying to justify or rationalize anything; just explaining myself. Having said that, my goal is to not look at porn, and I've become pretty good at resisting that temptation. In all facets of this addiction, I'm taking things one step, and one day, at a time.

So three months without PMO, what it's like? What changes have I seen?

Aside from not being super depressed for a few days, every other week, I now actively try to sexually engage with my girlfriend. I'm turned on around here, and I instigate sex, which I hardly, if ever, did before.  I haven't had any issues of ED, which I had pretty frequently before (and was always worried about in the past). One time I had ED and it was so bad, and I was so embarrassed about it, that it ended in a fight and I thought that my girlfriend and I were going to break up over it. I get hard and I stay hard now. I understand that for young guys, ED has a lot to do with self confidence, and not worrying about ED (which worry itself is a cause of ED), and not PMOing has certainly increased my self confidence.

When I do look at porn now, it feels ""hollow."" I see the porn actors, and what they're doing, and I'm certainly turned on, but it feels empty. The best way I can describe it is that I'm ""hungry."" Like I'm seeing a picture of something, but there's a big part of what it means to be sexually full, that it isn't fulfilling to me. Like I'm seeing a picture of a hamburger, and it's making me salivate, but it's not doing anything for me; I'm still hungry and the picture isn't fulfilling that need for me.

- Started working a job where I interact with people all day long after 7 years of unemployment (due to depression and social anxiety).
- Significantly reduced anxiety and depression, although still there (and probably always will be to some extent) it's manageable to the point where it doesn't seem to hinder my day-to-day.
- Increased ability to focus, can read books again whereas I couldn't during times with heavy porn use, massively increased ability to plan ahead (weeks compared to two days max during porn use).

They have created the perfect drug for me.  I feel like I need it to feel better, to feel happy, to get through the never ending crap of everyday life.  It's easier and feels so good at the time.  And it's so hard to stay away from it, it's everywhere, I'm surrounded by triggers.  

I feel like I'm swimming in this sea that is teeming with sharks. 

**I am an active participant:** Someone didn't grab my hand, point my mouse, click on that link.  I chose to do it.  I know I shouldn't, but I do anyway.  Here sharks...have another bite of my flesh.  

So, as an active participant, I'm going to swim over there, slowly, one gentle kick at a time, to where the water isn't so scary.  If I leave those sharks alone (don't look at them, don't think about them), they'll leave me alone.

They will splash, flash their teeth, jump out of the water to get my attention, but if I just keep swimming, slowly but surely, I'll get further away from them.  Safer.  Stronger.  Better.

**I am close-minded:**  I look at this moment and it's all I see.  I don't see that hour afterward.  I don't see my night.  I don't see tomorrow or the rest of the week, or the rest of February.  Or March.  Or 2014.  or the year 2020.  I see this moment.  

If I stop and open up my mind and look at where I'm going to be--minus PMO--by the end of this day, this week, this year of 2013...Where am I?  I can see myself successful, free of it, rich, traveling, laughing and laughing some more, hugging, being hugged, enjoying everything so much more.  What about by the year 2020?  Where am I then?  What am I doing?  Who am I with?  What am I driving?  Where am I?  How happy am I?  I picture myself extremely happy in the year 2020.

Or, on February 25th, 2020, will I be on that website again, looking at that video again, hurting myself--still?  In 8 years, will I STILL be doing this?  

I'm going to say nope and open my mind to what lay ahead.  I'm going to look at it, really see it,  and say, ""I want that.""

**I am...done:**  Without it, I am amazing.  I'm capable.  Confident.  One of the few.  I'm no longer a victim.  I'm me.  I'm not missing opportunity.  If I am, it's not my fault anymore, because I'm showing up.  It is no longer my ""reason"" for failure.  Without it, there's no more excuses.  

Without PMO, I have my best chance to win at everything.  

So, PMO, I'm done with you. All you scumbag P-ographers can F-off.  You don't get one more minute of my precious time. It's my time and I'm spending it on things of value. Things and actions that take me further away from the sharks and closer to that island over there, where I'm safe, warm, loved, laughing, happy.  Things that will lead me to that life I see up there, in 2020.

**Who am I?**  I don't know.  I'm 46 and I still don't know.  

All I know is, what I'm not.  And that's someone who uses porn.

(Kind of long and semi-rantish)",22,1,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/pornfree/comments/vgniq/relapsed_twice_in_two_days_after_going_27_days/,"First, I'll tell you how it happened. I was sitting there reading in a book and a thought crept across my mind that went something like this: ""How bad could your addiction have really been? It's been 27 days and you don't really feel any different"". So I began to think about it and I thought and thought and decided that OK, maybe I looked at porn a lot but since I don't feel altogether different.. maybe I wasn't actually addicted (Spoiler alert: I was REALLY wrong). In any case, I ran with this line of reasoning and decided that ah, maybe just once wouldn't be so bad.. so I decided to start browsing. As soon as I started to browse, my heart rate increased and I started to get really focused on finding the perfect one (warning sign number 1). After 30 minutes, even though it only felt like 5 minutes (warning sign number 2), I'd found the perfect one. My cat was meowing for pats but I didn't want to be interrupted, so instead of petting her, I locked her in her room (warning sign number 3). After getting comfortable, I was so excited to be looking at porn again I literally jizzmed in under 10 seconds (warning sign number 4).  Afterwards, I felt a few things: tired, ashamed and guilty, but above all.. I felt sad. (warning sign number 5). 

Going through my old PMO routine made me realize that yeah, I was addicted.. but not only that, I was REALLY addicted.. and even though I didn't really feel any significant differences *physically* after the 27 days (except for trouble falling asleep after the first two weeks) I was definitely addicted to it, still am addicted to it, and probably won't ever not be addicted to it. 

Even though I felt no difference *physically* (I had no more energy than usual, I still had ups and downs, etc.) I noticed that my outlook towards women had begun to change. I began to notice a subtle change in the way I look at women, away from ""Damn I want to fuck her"" to really being interested in them as human beings, their thoughts, opinions, beliefs, etc. I have the tendency to simultaneously exalt them while I degrade them and porn is definitely, at least for me, the reason for this. The result has been that I've been intimidated by real women because I've only ever looked at them for their beauty and searching out the ""perfect"" porn has had the effect of convincing me that all pretty women are perfect, that their personality doesn't matter, and that they would never want to talk to me because they're perfect and I""m not. 

Being off porn has taught me that whether pretty or not, women are human; that they are made up of a mix of positive and negative qualities. And relapsing has really shown me how pathological my thinking has been. 

During this time, I've kept up masturwanking without porn. Drastically cut down the amount of time that I masturwank, but still doing it. This time.. I think I'm going to do pornfree along with nofap.

What's the point of porn if you can't fap to it?

I was doing okay, too -- not perfect, like my nofap streak, but pretty okay -- until about six weeks ago, when my computer had some BSOD issues that turned out to be related to my trusty porn filter, K9 Web Protect.  I accessed my password (which takes 12 minutes to compute -- a great barrier to bypassing it lightly), uninstalled K9, and thought I could handle it, especially with OpenDNS still in place.

I could not.  There was one porn binge, then a little later another, and then three times in a week.  Well, hang it all! I reinstalled K9, and I'll live with the BSOD's.  And I took SmartSuka's advice and finally registered here and got my badge.

I have *no idea* why porn is still interesting to me.  I am looking at it without fapping, and frequently I don't even have the faint stirrings of an erection.  After all this nofap, a lot of the porn that used to get me off is either mindnumbingly boring or an actual turn-off.  I hate it, and not just at the intellectual level I used to, where I was like, ""I hate you because you're sick and I love you so much.""  No, I hate it now the way I hate fishsticks -- it's just uninteresting and gross.

*But I still look for it.*  Riddle me that, experienced porn-dodgers.

I don't really know where to start. The last few days have been the worst of my life. I feel like there's a constant weight pressing down on my chest. I can't breathe. I can barely work. Food tastes like chalk.

I am desperately in love with my boyfriend who, a few days ago, revealed to me that he has a porn addiction. We haven't been having sex regularly, and when we do it's only when I initiate. I have to beg him to kiss me, to hold me, to participate in any kind of intimacy. He's been so distant, and I've been very open with him about needing to have sex more often than we are, and that having to initiate all the time makes me feel terrible. I am constantly pleasuring him, when we have sex, but when it comes time to pleasure me he acts like it's a chore. It didn't used to be like that -- exactly the opposite, actually. He was always in it for my pleasure because of his low sex drive and, although it's been an issue for me, I was slowly coming around to the idea that our sex life would never be as full as I would like it to be. I can't force someone with a low sex drive to have sex as often as I want.

He revealed to me that it's been weeks and weeks since he really, truly wanted me. Instead, he's looking at pictures and videos of women who are prettier than me and thinner than me, multiple times a day. When I would ask him how often he would masturbate, he would flat out lie. He has some fetishes that I share, although he feels more strongly about them than I do. I have offered on multiple occasions to partake in those fetishes, to be put in positions he wants to see, etc. I have always been turned down. When I asked to see the porn that he watches, it's only of the fetish I have asked him to include me in. I feel like I've been punched in the stomach. You have a live fucking woman in front of you, begging to do this with you, and instead you watch porn. I have essentially been whoring myself out to someone who doesn't want me, who lies to me about his ability to be turned on by certain visuals. No, he's not turned on, not when it's me. He's turned on when it's other women, though. That doesn't seem to be a fucking problem. I believe that he wouldn't ever cheat on me with another woman in real life, as I've been through his email and facebook and phone history and there are no red flags. I discovered, though, that he's been commissioning art as recently as last week depicting certain characters in positions that I have offered on multiple occasions to be put into. He's been commissioning art when he has problems with money. He moved away for a year and a half and he claimed his trouble with money was the reason he couldn't move back to be with me yet, and all the while he was spending hundreds of dollars on porn subscriptions and art commissions.

I know the lying and the disinterest and the ridiculous spending are all signs of addiction. I understand this. My brain gets it. My brain gets that it's not about me, but my heart and my body feel so betrayed. I feel wretched, I feel used and abused and thrown aside. I have been cheated on. I can't even say that I *feel* like I've been cheated on, because this is cheating. The man that I want to spend the rest of my life with has been cheating on me multiple times a day with countless women in pictures and videos and hiding it from me. And yet I want him. When we're not together all I want is to be with him. He's sleeping on the couch and although I'm lying in bed alone, I can't even keep myself from wanting to be intimate with him. I know, though, that if he touches me even once right now I might lose it entirely. I had a panic attack at work the other night and had to leave early. It is *that bad.* I constantly feel sick and I can't finish a meal.

He gave me full access to his email, his phone, the websites he visits on a regular basis. He's changed his email address, deleted his paypal, and is in the process of getting into therapy. He seems like he's willing to change, and I desperately want to help him do that, but the truth of the matter is that if I hadn't confronted him, this would have kept going on. He does not want me. He has no interest in me. To be perfectly honest, at this point I don't think he's ever wanted me in the way that I constantly want him. Even outside the bedroom he's been half-assing the relationship. It took months and even a break to get him to finally move back to be with me (I even offered to move to his city and he turned me down), he doesn't do his part around the house unless I specifically ask him to, and having to ask him to be romantic in any way feels to me like a slap in the face. You should not have to force your boyfriend to show you affection. In public he's all over me, but when we're alone it's like he can't be bothered to acknowledge that I have physical and *emotional* needs that aren't being met. It means nothing if I have to ask for it. I asked him if there was something he was missing from the relationship, things I was or wasn't doing that he felt he couldn't tell me about for fear of hurting me, because this is a two-way street and if I was part of the problem I wanted to fix it. He denied that I had anything to do with his addiction. I believe him, but I still don't believe he wants to be with me.

We've had many long talks. He's answered every question I've asked. We've both cried a lot. I've been very clear that everything in this relationship changes or he finds somewhere else to live. He's been receptive to this and has been much more thoughtful of my needs over the past few days, and I hope that it stays that way. I've also made it clear that in order for this relationship to survive he has to really, really want me, not just pretend to want me. And that's hard for me, because how will I ever really know? I fear that I will always be questioning his behavior, always wondering if I really stir in him the feelings he stirs in me, always unsure in the back of my head if I'm really what he wants. I really don't know if this has done permanent damage to me and our relationship. I don't want that to be the case. We've been talking about marriage for months, and when I asked him yesterday why he would marry someone he didn't physically want, he responded with ""love."" I don't feel loved. I feel abandoned. 

I also know that it's not all about me. He has an addiction and he needs help. I *want* to help him. I love him, and even if my self-esteem and our relationship don't survive I want him to conquer this addiction. So what do I do? How do I best help him? When I asked him, all he said was that I need to hold him accountable -- ask to see his phone and the computer every time he's been using it alone, ask him if he's had any temptations, etc. What else can I do? So far all the changes he has made have been very positive, and I hope that it continues.

How do I help him further? How do I help our relationship and my self-esteem? We're broken.

I am so, so broken. Please help.

I was lustfilled. I kept going deeper and deeper, and now I'm addicted.

I've gone to a curious, socially normal 10 year old to a lust-filled, porn 

addicted, socially awkward 14 year old.
I have tried to stop in the past. My record for not looking at porn is 1 month.

***In 4 years, the longest I have gone without looking at porn is 30 days.***

It's a problem. I have to hide it from my christian family. I use IE's InPrivate Browsing, and when my folks ask to use my computer I make sure I open Firefox or Chrome for them.

I do all I can to make sure I don't get caught. I'm afraid to ask for a newer computer because if they go through it at a trade in the computer buyers might start asking about porn images.

I am afraid that it has permanently ruined me. I can't hardly talk to girls, and it has inadvertently made my an introvert. I sit at tables alone. The only time I feel like it's not affecting me is when I'm with my close friends, the sole people who would help me. I hide it from them. I don't wan't them to know.

 I don't want to go to a counselor or a therapist. While they may try to help you, they won't give you a cure, because without a cure, you'll have to keep returning.

It consumes me.

 I fap to people who I shouldn't. 

I masturbate at church.

 I masturbate at home.

 I can't stop it. 

It's illegal to view porn at my age, and I don't wan't to get in trouble for an addiction I can't stop.

So Please, I ask. Help me break my addiction. Once I break it, I will never look back.

Quite honestly, I don't know if I would have listened, but even if I didn't I would have known what potential danger lays before me. I was ignorant, and ignorance is not bliss. 


And so this has led me to this: if you have kids or will have kids, talk to them about this ""new drug"" as I'm hearing people refer to it. Tell them its not normal, and its certainly not worth it. Its just as addicting as drugs, so we should treat it with the danger associated. 

If you can stop it before it takes over their lives, why wouldn't you? It may be a terribly awkward conversation, but they'll be better off.

...HOLY FUCKING SHIT I MADE IT, IS THIS REAL LIFE?! I HAVE DREAMED OF THIS DAY FOR SO LONG!!!!

So many days of hopelessness and despair, relapse after relapse, embarrassing episodes of erectile dysfunction, I never thought I would make it to 90 days, it just seemed impossible. I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL. All I can say is suck it up princess and *keep slogging on*, if I did it then you can do it. Its fucking worth it.

My major lessons:

- **Persistence** is the ONLY way to succeed in anything, the minute you give up you've lost; JUST. KEEP. GOING.
- **Relapses are just learning experiences.** Every relapse I had I would learn another of my triggers or another rationalisation (meditation helps to become aware of these).
- **Edging is as bad if not worse than blowing your load to porn**, reset your counter if you edge, no excuses. ZERO TOLERANCE.
- Porn is fucking awesome, I used to love cuing up 50 videos and helping put Mr. Kleenex's kids through college. I don't judge anyone who bludgeons the beefsteak to porn, I'm just not one of those people any more, that's just WHO I DECIDED TO BE. As you start to break free, try to **forge a new identity**, tell yourself ""I'm not someone who watches porn"". SIMPLE. Doesn't leave any room for rationalisation, you don't need some elaborate reason.
- Adjusting the antenna every now and then (no fantasy, no porn) is a good way to let off steam and reduce urges. THE MAIN ENEMY IS PORN. We're just rewiring our brains, and natural masturbation is part of a healthy reward circuit.


Who I was when I started:

- Wow I was a totally different person, like welcome to Pathetic Town, population: me aka faggot.
- I was riddled with guilt and shame. I couldn't hold eye contact with people. I would be overcome with fear in basic interactions.
- Would routinely want to be swallowed into the ground.
- No idea where I was going in life.
- Dead eyes, bad skin, weak voice, NO ENERGY.
- Terrible memory and conversation skills.
- Social recluse with no real friends
- Would objectify every girl, I was a terrifying weirdo to them
- All in all it just felt like there was some fucking dark fog hanging over my life
- Feel bad --&gt; watch porn --&gt; keep feeling bad --&gt; watch more porn --&gt; DURRR Y DO I FEL BAD


Who I am now:

- Passionate about life, joyful vibrant person
- Full of energy and motivation
- Deeper voice, better skin, vibrant eyes, THICK COCK
- Morning wood :D
- Can see a bigger picture of things, learned a lot from this journey
- Confident in social situations and talking to strangers and loved ones
- Focused on my dreams and hobbies
- Popular, make friends easily, able to express myself
- Hot girls actually miss me --- what the fuck?
- The fog has lifted and its hard to describe how much better life is afterwards. 

THIS IS REAL LIFE.

Giving up porn gave me the strength to take on other habits which have helped drastically with my growth as a person, things like daily meditation, exercise and eating healthy are crucial, but my advice is start one at a time and only when you feel like you have your other habits DOWN. We only have a certain amount of willpower to use each day.

So I hope my ramblings can be of some use to you guys. I want to thank you motherfuckers for being an awesome support community, together we are strong.

For the last year of my life, this has been my goal. I finally got past 11 days, and was worried about getting to here. And i am. It feels amazing! Knowing that you've done somthing you worked so hard for, putting off this addiction, fighting pornbrain with you guys in a hardcore match of wits and brains; its made me feel, well, epic. And it will continue to give me this charge.

I don't know what to write. I don't know how to thank you. I do know one thing though, its worth it. Between myself, God, and you guys and girls, I know I can hack this. Thank you. Thank you all so much. I'm going to ramble a bit, so be warned.

About a year ago, I set the goal to stop doing porn and fapping. I failed, and failed, and failed, and failed, and failed. It seemed I would never be able to get past week one. I subscribe to Art of Manliness, and they did a post on how to improve your life on reddit. They listed this subreddit, and for a while I forgot about it. I finally checked it out.... and continued to fail. Finally, I got into the swing of things about a month ago. I posted as much as I could, trying to help others inorder to help myself.... A strange thing came of that.

I started to genuinely love the people on here. I cared for you in a deep, pure love that I hadn't experianced in a very long time. It was wonderful. This love motavated me to pray, and I felt God's love stronger than I ever had. With all this love going around, I figured I could finally quit FOR REAL.

And I guess this is the first step to that. I beleived that strongly until I almost died (pornfree wise... :) this morning. I woke up with the strongest and worst temptations I've ever had. I got onto my computer with a half and half shot, not sure at weather I would come on porn free or watch pornography.

I chose the first. I read an article about how people feel more emotion off porn, and this chased the temptations away. I tried to help the people I love on here with the new found joy, and I made it through (thank heavens).

I think I got attacked so strongly by porn brain is because I'm going rafting in central Idaho till saturday. Central Idaho on the salmon river, my personal refuge from all porn and masterbation. Its like my brain knew this was the last shot for a long time to slay my pornfreeness. 

In short, I know this is all worth it. I love you, I love God, I love being pornfree, and for the first time in a very long time, I can say I love my life, and I love being me. Being off porn has helped me be more social, all of the old humor and dumb wit I loved having is returning (the puns everyone hates... awwwwww yeah!). I'm starting to have better relationships with women (and finally one in particuar isn't nearly as awkward, finally!). I feel more awake and alive! My joy is without bounds!!!

Fight on everyone. If you need anything, please, don't hesititate to post or message me (I won't answer till I get back saturday, but I will answer!) I hope I find you all five days farther when I get back. 

Hail to freedom, Hail to will power, Hail to Us! Hail to /r/pornfree!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Love you guys.

Although I eat healthily most days and try to avoid porn, 2-3 days a week I will fall into a destructive mode (often after a night out where everyone seems to be with their girlfriends, or meeting women). I'm pretty sure that along with shyness, heavy porn use in my teenage years (not as bad these days, but still a few times a week) as well as the lack of female relationships/friendships in my life has warped my mind when it comes to sex and the opposite sex.

I really need to stop.

My problem is very much linked with a toxic relationship that has consumed the past 5 years of my life. Unfulfilled with the relationship, I quickly became obsessive about sex. Unfulfilled with the sex between us, I turned to pornography. Ive had periods where, when away from my gf, I would spend hours browsing porn, and saving a selection. I did this at home, locked in my room. Even at college, with my roomate a few feet away. I used porn more than I masturbated. Half a year ago I hit a low point in my life and masturbated multiple times a day, always using marijuana and porn. I was a recluse, and wasted away in my room. At the new year I quit for a while, the girl too. Relapse again with all of the above.

My problem has many components. Ive recently cut off all contact with the girl, a first. This is the end of that, I have wasted so much opportunity and I cannot afford any more. Not to mention she does not make me happy one bit.

Now I need to stop looking at porn. It is too easy and too powerful. I find myself slipping back into old habits since I have so much more free time once again. I need to regain what I have lost, social skills, friends, passion. It's not going to happen if I sit on my ass and tell myself, one more won't hurt.

Some get their first taste close to when they reach their double digits, not me.  My first taste occurred in the 1980’s when I was in the single digits.  

To be quite honest, it wasn’t alien; it was a thrill.  Somehow, I innately understood, as I later related my understanding to my concerned and embarrassed father, the reproductive and pleasurable purpose, later still confirmed as correctly interpreted, of what I witnessed on the screen.  It stole my breath.  It made my pulse race.  Though I wouldn’t see pornography again for many years, I think that in that moment, I was hooked.

And I felt the same during my last relapse, just over a week ago.  I quit back on January 4th, 2013, but relapsed just over a week ago for the first time in about three months.  I felt again the thrill of the forbidden, the illicit.  The first time that is.  Having relapsed once, I consciously chose to relapse the second time in the same day.  The second time, I forced myself to take it in, so that I could remember just how boring it all felt, at least, after the fact.  I *needed* to feel just how boring, and unexciting a presenting female really is. Well, when she’s fake anyway.

The thing that nobody really tells you about pornography, and something I would have liked to realize some years ago, is that it’s fake.  It’s unreal.  It’s simulated.  It’s a magic show.  It’s not sex, not even self-sex.  It’s a self-reinforcing pattern of sterile self-pleasure – masturbation.  A simple outlet entirely directed towards the self.  Porn usage is little more than chasing a dopamine high at a high cost:  your self-discipline, your identity, your soul.  

When I first saw porn, it didn’t take much for me realize that I wanted to experience what the actor had experienced:  sex with a willing and eager partner.  Of course, it would be many more years before I got to partake in what I saw, but, even after marriage, and a gradually improving sex-life, my pattern of usage continued.  Usage?  No, not exactly.  The truth is that when one only thinks about chasing the dopamine high, it’s easier, isn’t it?  It’s easier to quietly fill a biological desire than it is to create desire in another person.  It’s easier to browse and release, than it is to go upstairs, close the door, stimulate another warm body, and ultimately share the embrace.  And porn never says no.  Porn never says I’m tired.  Porn isn’t real.

But I’ve come to realize something.  Porn is just as much about invisibility as it is about visual stimulation.  Porn is a magic show; it’s the perfect tool to make your beloved disappear behind a computer screen.  And in so doing, make myself disappear too.  How could I expect my beloved to hear what I didn’t say?  Could she honestly respond to desires that I didn’t express, because they were being fulfilled by fake internet women?  And so, for years of married life, I became a no man, a former man, an invisible man.  Porn can be a tool for making yourself disappear, as well as any mate you may have, or any potential mates.  

When I went back to the Church, at first, I did it for my daughters, because they needed something better than the “lifestyle” we were living before that.  But in the Church, I heard the message that I think I needed to hear; you, bornagaincatholic, you matter.  You’re important.  You’re loved.  Stop being a shadow of a man, and start being a man.  

To all those doing pornfree, however you may perceive the message, let me repeat it for all of you:  you – YOU, are important.  YOU are a person.  YOU aren’t invisible, and you’re never truly going to be invisible.  So stay strong, and stop trying to make yourself disappear.  

And the person you may love is important. They aren’t invisible either, so stop trying to make them disappear.  They are real, and in the darkness of the night, they want to be invited to return your love.  

Thanks pornfree.  Thanks to you, for trying to make a better choice.

For those of you struggling, maybe just this:  remember that you are infinitely more important than what you see on the screen.

Disclaimer
As you read this try not to think about a white bear.

I believe a lot of our initial battle plans when starting the 90 day journey is to white knuckle it and resist the temptations, which I think we can all agree on isn't always that successful. One issue with this attempt is we are under the impression that we need to suppress our thoughts of porn. I often see post of ""How do I stop thinking about Porn?"" The Problem here is that you are trying not to think about it.

Have we stopped thinking about that white bear yet?

You see I will try and give a primitive explanation and if asked I will be glad to go more in depth. Basically when you are trying not to think of something a part of your brain developed by evolution is on the look out for any signs of this threat. Like our ancestors trying to avoid being eaten by a lion. One part of your brain is trying not to think about porn while the other part of your brain is on the look out for any dangerous temptations, can you see the problem here. you have created a paradox in turn you actually increase your level of urges by trying to suppress it.

Ever notice you have a harder time avoiding sweets when your on a diet, to be fair there are other issues involving willpower why it is more difficult which I will cover in another guide.

That being said I'll make it clear how to get rid of that white bear now. Just like in paradoxical intention you need to embrace the issue instead of suppressing it, surf the urge if you will. Allow any intrusive thoughts to enter your mind and observe them from a distance, feel your urges and understand them and after accepting the fact that even though you can not control your thoughts you do not have to act on them. The fear of intrusive thoughts is caused by the feeling that we will inevitably act on them. Which of course is not true.

Be like water, practice meditating &amp; when the thoughts arise imagine yourself under water and the thoughts going right through you.

I am trying to write a guide everyday because this is a journey we take one day at a time, also none of these guides are end all be all solution to this problem but instead a variety of topics to help along the way.

 I know when we relapse we feel down and wonder, I've done everything what is going to be different this time... well I hope these guides will offer hope that it will be different this time.

1361137240.0,21,self.pornfree,18pm3u,"30 Day Update: No P, M, or O",23,2,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/pornfree/comments/18pm3u/30_day_update_no_p_m_or_o/,"Hello there everyone,

I am officially 30 days in with no PMO (together or separate) and thought that sharing my thoughts and experiences would be good for myself and others here as well. Over these 30 days this community has proved indelible to my success thus far and I hope that I will continue to make the right choice each day for sobriety, taking from all of you the courage and wisdom that is imparted. 

The last four weeks have been truly challenging but incredible; I have been a porn addict for 7 years (am currently 20 years old) and had forgotten how much enjoyment had been drained out of my life by the addiction. The first week was pretty nice but my hopes were not exactly high. The second week, in a word, was difficult; I implemented many changes but found a key post on this subreddit which discussed the implications of powerlessness in addiction, and how, it is truly up to the addict (in the form of a choice) whether or not they can have the humility to accept that they, as a person, cannot beat the addiction, but that a higher moral authority is needed in order to allow the person to suffer, in order to heal. It is amazing before how much I unnecessarily struggled to try and mentally will my cravings away; it is just not how it works; instead of combating my cravings by thinking I should not have them, I accept that they are there, choose not to indulge them, and do my best to fight the cravings with alternative actions (I read, I cook, I watch a favorite t.v. show, I take a walk, etc).

If I can share one thing that has helped me more than any other at keeping my sobriety so far it is that key point right there: I daily must accept that I still, deep down, want to PMO, but that each day, when I choose long term healing over short term gratification, I am allowing *a new me* to grow, I am at my core allowing myself to change; I have realized over the last few weeks how deeply rigid I have been in my life for a long time and changing has not been easy but the fruits have been enormous so far, I will list a few:

1) Had my first date today (in over a year). I met her with a bunch of friends at a bar a few nights ago and managed to not disrespect here that night (even as I was a little bit sloshed, I will admit) and had an amazing discussion over our date, which was probably only a possibility, mind you, because I had the discipline that I never had before to not hit on her. We have plans for another very soon.

2) I have more energy and discipline in my life in general, I now make the bed, cook for myself, clean, walk more, actually ENJOY my leisure time, and have become better at my studies (I am a history student).

3) The way I interact socially has changed somewhat with people that were a source of frustration in my life; I am trying to not change the people that cause me frustration, and as such, I tend to ignore those that I find hyper critical or manipulative. The minute I realized how bad some of my friends were I went out to a pub, and due to the increased confidence I have because of my sobriety, was able to strike up a conversation with a guy, who invited me to a table to meet his friends, and one of his friends is the girl I took out on a date today. Funny how the confidence I have from healing translated into all of those outcomes.

4) I will finish it with this: Every day, I try to remember that today could be the day I relapse and PMO. It forces me to re-accept that I am an addict and to accept what PMO has done to me in my life. I do not pretend that there is no chance I will relapse; tomorrow could be the day I reset my counter. This focuses me daily and reminds me that, with PMO, my life is miserable. This exercise is not designed to make me feel negative, quite the contrary, it reminds me that if I choose to PMO that I do it starring the consequences in the face. It gives me joy and courage knowing that I do not need to choose that path, and reminds of the new path I go down every day.

That about does it folks. I wish every single one of you the best in achieving sobriety and will continue to frequent theses forums; I do have one quick technical question for some of the more experienced folks here. Before going on my date I wanted to see if the.. um.. ""goods"" were still working (not to O, just to see if everything was functioning without pornography), within seconds I was happily reminded that things were doing well but immediately felt a shot of endorphins that made me uneasy and gave me a pretty bad craving for PMO.

I realize now that this was probably not wise and want some folks to speak bluntly to me. Did I reverse my progress over the last 30 days in terms of my neurochemistry? I was under the impression that sex and stimulation did not reverse the process, though stimulation is to be avoided extensively (I have not done any kind of stimulation up until my ""trial run"" today. All of my research has pointed to both of these conclusions but I still feel a bit uneasy about it all, who knows, maybe I will wake up fine and with no concerns at all, but still.. I am a bit concerned and desire any warranted information anyone might have, even if its just a personal experience.

Thanks folks.

Anyone quit today, and for the next 20 days, will hit their 90 day mark in April. These quitters are part of the April Hall of Fame 90 days quit group. Anyone quitting in this group are all part of the same team, and we're all going to experience the highs and lows together. We'll all be here to help each other out.

The idea of a ""Hall of Fame"" group is something that I'm borrowing from another website that I'm a member of, that helped me to quit smoking. The concept worked very well for everyone on that site, and I'm hoping to replicate my success with that here.

If this catches on, this is but the first of many rolling Hall of Fame quit groups. Next we'll create the May 2013 group, then the June group, so on and so forth.

Everyone must post roll call every day, to check in and show all their quit buddies that they remain dedicated to slaying this beast. I'm not sure how we should work out the formatting with this--I think it's important that everyone clearly sees the list of names each day, so that they can notice when someone hasn't checked in and send them a support message. So we'll try a few ways of posting roll call and see what works best.

Anyone interested, please join this group and start posting roll. I'll post day one.

EDIT:

Alright, I've put together a spreadsheet of usernames in the group. We've got **31 people** committed to quitting together! Some of you guys didn't know when you started (and hadn't created a badge) and a few of you are going to hit 90 days before April. I've included your name in the list so you guys can help support the rest of us, but let me know if you want me to take you out of the roll call list.

Today was day one for me. I'm not sure what I should do for tomorrow, so we can all check in? I suppose I'll just update this thread? Any suggestions are appreciated. I can't really create a new post for each day, since we're all on different day counts.

(it works!)",25,7,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/pornfree/comments/146jaj/call_me_weak_minded_but_after_relapsing_to_porn/,"Background: 20yr male, porn since... probably 4th grade. (9yrs old?). So that's 11 years of porn use. Porn/fapping 3x day MINIMUM

Problems: ED, PE, enjoying gay porn/thoughts when I masturbated

Basically, Sometime in july I started no porn (and nofap too, as I was having sex semi-regularly), and I read over some of my results from back then:

Occasional morning wood, easier time getting it up but not great erections, could get a ""decent"" erection during sex.

August:

I was still seeing results, but went back to college mid-august (so no more sex). I switched to trying no-fap. Making it three days was a HUGE struggle. Then I would relapse. Rinse and repeat for almost 3 weeks. Results: better erections, morning wood almost everyday, made it a whole 7 days without jerking off. No more craving/feeling like it was a habit to masturbate.

September: 2 weeks in I started having sex with a new girl, albeit only a few times but, I now could have sex with a good erection, even if drunk. Even was able to go for round 2 SOMETIMES, but my erection wasn't as good as the first. Relapses were horrible and resulted in fapping/porn 4/5x a day.

October: Still have PE, can get and maintain a full erection even with a condom on. Could go for round 2 with a PRETTY decent erection. If I relapsed, it was only now, 3x a day.

November: RESULTS!!! I relapsed the first week to porn, but now my relapse was only 1 time instead of doing it 3-5x a day. I finally have made it almost 3 weeks now without using porn to masturbate. The first half of the month was great, I thought at the time, my erections were now pretty solid, and my PE was going away (yes, I even had PE when I masturbated). 

2nd half of November: I have never seen more results then this:
I now can fap for 10 minutes (compared to under 3) and I have no more cravings for porn. I did however, go to /gonewild the other day and look at ONE thread. I think that this is the first time in as long as I can remember that my dick actually started to MOVE (didn't get hard though) from viewing a naked image of a girl. I've been fapping a lot these past couple days (as in, 1-2x a day w/o porn) simply because I have never had this amazing of an erection/fapping is fun again. My dick gets rock hard, and stays that way even if I take my hand off of it for a couple seconds (something it didn't use to do). I had sex the other night, and lasted WAY longer than I used to last. (not that it was super long, but I've improved). I find girls ATTRACTIVE when I look at them. No more gay thoughts/desire for gay porn.

I'm starting another week of nofap (and obvs no porn) for the next week today.

Conclusions: Even if you relapse, but continue TO TRY to overcome addiction to porn you will EVENTUALLY start seeing the results you want. I didn't even realize I was having cravings for porn that I couldn't control until I started doing this. I've been in such awe the past couple days that fapping/erections/lasting longer (even from fapping) that I've given in a little bit to the whole ""nofap"" thing because I'm so happy with myself. Further, I REALLY do believe that while noporn is great, adding in REDUCED fapping/minimal fapping is what helped me overcome my addiction. 

And yes, I'm posting this so that I can look back on it in a months time and see how much improvements I've had since then.

Two weeks ago she asked me if I still looked at porn. I said yes. It's come up twice before in our relationship. I said I would quit. I never took it seriously. I've been using porn to masturbate for 17, 18 years. Twice a week.

I thought it was harmless. But it's not. 

I convinced myself that I never chose porn over sex. But when I chose porn, it had consequences on my sex life. I didn’t make efforts to have sex in the day or two following porn. Which means that if I wasn’t making efforts to have sex, that I wasn’t paying attention to my wife. I wasn’t giving her compliments, I wasn’t maintaining that connection. And then days later if I tried to initiate sex, she must have wondered where this attention was coming from and saw right through it. Or that I wasn’t even giving her attention, but still wanted on-demand sex. No wonder we weren’t having sex as much as either of us wanted. 

It’s true that I always preferred having sex to watching porn. But I let my porn habit get in the way of having sex. 

So this is where I'm at now. I destroyed all my trust and credibility. I devastated the most important person in my life. She's ready to leave me and I don't blame her. She was always there for me and I sought after thousands of other women and never cared how it would affect her. 

We're in counseling now. Within five minutes the counselor told me that twice a week for 17 years is an addiction. It was a slap to the face. 

I immediately quit and honestly haven't been tempted to look. I did have the urge to get off once. 

Over the last two weeks, among all the fighting, our sex life has improved. I feel closer to her. But it might be too late. 

And the porn was never worth it. I went back to it time and time again for the pleasure, for the release. But it was an empty, fleeting pleasure. Like eating a candy bar. As soon as it's over, the pleasure is gone. And you're just left with nothing except empty calories or empty feelings. 

It feels terrible to know that I may have lost the best thing in my life over something so worthless.

I would get in the car to go return them and then decide to run back in the apartment to watch that ""one scene"" just ""one more time"" after 3 or 4 days of this I just decided to keep the tapes and avoid the late fee.

Sometimes I'd order them online, and write reviews for the movies after I viewed them. Shamefully some of those reviews are still online today. I'd collect, Fap, get disgusted : throw them all away , vow to get my life together , and then go back a week later and start the cycle over. Now it's 2013 and I still have the same pattern.

Say I do not masturbate for 3 days and then one night I cannot fall asleep because a raging hard on is keeping me awake - I find that this is a situation when I would need to masturbate because my body is demanding that I need to relieve tension built up down there.

I've become more senstitive to stories of sexual abuse, like I'm more affected than I used to be when I hear of an instance of rape etc.
I used to shrug off stories of rape and not really engage how I felt about sexual abuse in an ethical way until I started to address the issue of porn.
It was only when I had stood far back enough from my own addiction to what is really just a form of sexual abuse, that I realised that in blocking out the reality of sexual abuse, I was subconsciously defending my right to indulge in it.
This realisation came on the last and closest call I had: I was leafing through a photography book featuring old pictures of Native Americans when I came accross a picture of a naked indian woman. Next thing I know I'm google imaging 'Native American women', while chanting the justification mantra in my head (it's okay, it's not porn, it's okay, it's not porn...) it was during this search I found out that 1 in 3 Native American women are sexually assaulted in their lives, usually by non-Native American men.
It was then I realised how sexualised these women are, how there is this prevalent image of the scantily clad Indian princess in Western culture and how fucking delusional and warped it is, and how the true beauty of women is so often brtutalised and poisoned by uncontrollable and blinding sexual fantasy.
When we read something like this: http://rt.com/news/saudi-preacher-fine-rape-333/, it's quite easy to distance ourselves from the one commiting the act, thinking of them as straight up 'evil' or inhuman, of an entirely different kind than ourselves, but I think we as men especially have to address the reality of what motivates an act like this. 

So for me the thing that has affected me most isn't so much the actual phsycal act itself, painful and horrible as it must be for the victim, but trying to identify with the mindstate of the rapist. The depths of depravity in the mind of someone who could cause such harm just to satisfy their own craving is just about the scariest direction I can look within my own mind. 
What horrifies me is that, even if only on a microcosmic level, when I justify my indulgence in porn, I *can* identify with the mindstate of someone who could inflict such a degree of heedless and absolute unrestrained cruelty, justified by some sense of righteous indignation. It follows the same paradigm, and if not on the same level of delusion and confusion, I'm still a human male and as such I *could* have become one who rapes and kills women, this potential was present at some point within me.

I'm also starting to realise the difference between healthy and unhealthy sex life.
IMO, healthy sex should just be a part of life, not that one's life should be *about* sex at all, but that it should just be a natural feature of the flow of life, instead of something sought after and craved like a drug.
I understand the sex drive and how powerful and persuasive it is, but I think in having knowledge about it, we as the most adaptable, dynamic beings on Earth, in our power as potential society builders, can learn to integrate the sex urge into a healthy way of being, as I believe it can be under the right conditions.

As far as /r/pornfree goes, it is needless to say that violent and misogynist pornography inevitably contributes to a hostile and unsafe environment for women and induces moronic and heartless mindstates in men, including delusions about the nature of women and what they want. In the end, both sexes suffer from our unawareness of our sexual urges and habits.",,False,,t5_2rglh,False,,month3,True,t3_17zwhw,http://www.reddit.com/r/pornfree/comments/17zwhw/changes_in_attitude_towards_sex_since_ive_become/,

Then I disconnected from the internet, and opened up a blank word document and typed the name of the first porn star that came to mind, then the second, and so on. 
I wanted to see just how many names I had stored up in my head. You think you may only have a few, but then, as you keep typing, new ones are remembered, and then new ones from them. After a few minutes, I had seventy names written down. 
Seventy unique names that I could pull out of the thin air in my head. 
Seventy names of porn stars that I had, memorized, instead of anything else. 
So now, I'm not going to focus too heavily on that list. I'm going to focus on other things that I want to know: Where countries are on a map, conversion rates for the metric system, random facts for when a conversation hits a lull, the lyrics to songs so that I can entertain myself if I'm stuck at a bus stop without an iPod.
Over time, I want to take each one of those names, which are useless to improving my life, and only feed my addiction, and then rewire the space in my brain holding onto them with something that will not only help me move on, but make my life better and more informed along the way.

I have viewed porn almost every single week since that time.  For many years, it was several times a day.  During middle school and high school, I was a very nervous and an unemotional kid.  I never really laughed and I was very serious most of the time.  I could never stand up for myself and people would always make me the center of the joke.  (I had shitty friends, but I didn’t know that at the time) These cruel jokes made me very insecure and automatically have hatred toward any new people I met.   I was only comfortable around my family members and a few close childhood friends.  During my intensive years of viewing porn, I had extreme social anxiety.  “Where do I put my hand?  This is awkward.  Don’t look at that person. The person in the next car is looking at me.  Why are people looking at me?  I’m an awkward dancer.  I can’t sing.  I’m not that fast.  I’m dumb.”  This was my daily thought process for most of my adolescence.  It wasn't until I started getting sexual active that I started to see the negative results of porn addiction and social anxiety. 
	
   In the beginning of senior year, I met a girl, Brooke, and the first time in my life I got into a relationship.  She was a great girl and really helped me explore my sexuality.  We messed around and I did everything with her from the hundreds of hours of viewing porn.  (I actually have a very funny sex story with this girl.  I’ll post it if people are interested.)   While hooking up, I would get extremely nervous.  Thoughts and panic flowed through me.  “Why wasn’t I getting an erection?!  Do I have erectile dysfunction?  Am I gay?  What's wrong with me?""  The anxiety was overwhelming.  After doing research into pornography addiction, I discovered it could lead to poor performance in the bedroom and it worse of all it causes anxiety.  I had to change.  I texted Brooke and told her I have something important to tell her.   Opening up was tough, but I told her everything.  After listening and not saying anything, Brooke says, “You know porn is not real, right?”  That thought had never occurred to me.  I have been so wrapped up in the porn fantasy that it never occurred to me it was all an act.  Porn taught me women always want sex.  The goal of sex is to have an orgasm.  Women like to be insulted and treated like objects.  It never occurred to me that this wasn’t true.  Porn had literally brain washed me.  
	
   Since that point in my life, I have been attempting to rid my life of porn, but find myself going back in to the hole.  Finding r/NoFap and r/PornFree has been a tremendous help towards my recovery.  Unfortunately, I will sometimes trip up and relapse; however, my life as completely turned around!  I am so much happier, friendly, loving, understanding, relaxed, and self-confident.  I have realized my goal in life and that is to be happy.  What makes me happy is doing well in school, maintaining a healthy lifestyle, and keeping close with friends and family.  My friends are actually friends now.  They care about me and I love them.   I keep in touch with all my family members and old friends since I’m away at college.  In between class, I’ll give a quick call to someone or after I finish up my schoolwork.  I really make an effort to stay in touch with people, because it’s easy to let them slip out of your life.  I still struggle with pornography addiction, but I have a good hold on it.  I know I will always be addicted to porn and I have to constantly be conscious to avoid slipping up.  

TL;DR – Addicted to porn since 12.  Social anxiety, made fun of, scared, and anxious most of that time.  After finding r/NoFap and r/PornFree life has turned around.

Three weeks ago I had no idea what Reddit was (living under rock, etc).  Until last night, I had no idea there were groups like noFap and PornFree where I could associate with other people with the same problems.  It is heartening to know I'm not alone.  

I'm going to tell my story, because I feel that I need to share it to make this attempt ""real"" and consequential for me and to give myself some accountability for a change.  You don't have to read it if you don't want to.  

I'm 29, married, Christian, have a good job, own my own home, have some toys, etc.  And I'm struggling with an addiction nobody but those who read this text know about.  I've been addicted (and will freely admit that now) to pornography for 18 years and to masturbation for even longer.  The way I view women, myself and society have been deeply scarred over the years.  I've done a good job hiding it from those people close to me over the years.  I've become an expert at it, really.  I feel like I'm two different people -- one of whom is caught in bear trap called internet pornography and wants to escape but doesn't know where to start.

Over the last two or three years I have noticed I'm starting to lose sexual desire for my wife.  We've only been married for 6 years, but we have been a couple for 13 years.  We are highschool sweethearts.   I've noticed that, rather than have sex with an actual willing, beautiful woman who loves me and cares deeply for me, I'd rather have sex with my hand while fantasizing about some random model.  A couple of times, I couldn't even get it up for my beautiful wife.  She just assumed it was a fluke.   

When I was in HS I assumed that my porn use and masturbation would stop when I got a girlfriend.  It didn't.  I then assumed it would stop when I started to have sex with a real girl.  It didn't.  I then assumed my problem (I was starting to wonder if I was normal at that point) would stop when I finished school and got a real job.  It didn't.  I then assumed it would stop when I got married.  It didn't.  See a pattern here?  How many New Years has YOUR secret resolution to yourself been ""stop using porn and stop jerking off?""  At least ten for me.  Ten years of saying I'm going to stop and the best I ever did was abstain for three weeks once.

My entire adult life is tainted with images and memories I don't want.  My 13-year relationship with my wife is outlasted by my relationship with pornography.  The only people who've known me longer than I've known pornography are my family and my longest best friend (none of whom know about it either!).  My christian friends and fellowship group at church have no idea what I do in my office every time I'm home alone.  My wife -- my best friend and my lover and my everything on this world has no idea what I've seen and what I've done to myself throughout the entire time she has ever known me.  Sometimes I think she knows a person that I'm not.  That if she ever knew the truth she would never forgive me -- after all, I've kept this from her for nearly half of both our lives.  I've struggled with whether or not I should tell her about this.  Would she be better of if she never knew and I succesfully quit?  Maybe.  But would I?  The very fact that I'm telling my story here means that I feel somebody needs to know.  I am addicted to pornography and masturbation and have been since I was barely 12 years old.  I can write the words here and give them immortality in the internet, but I don't know if I could ever say them to somebody I love.   

Today marks the first day of what I hope is a huge change in my life.  

NO MORE wasting time and energy to hoardes of random women on the 'net that I will never know.  
NO MORE lying to people I love about what is wrong when I am depressed and angry at myself and everyone else and everything because I used.  
NO MORE worrying if I remembered to delete my browsing history when somebody uses my computer.  
NO MORE loss of sexual appetite for my own wife because I ""used it up"" on worthless porn. 
NO MORE feelings of guilt and conviction and asking God for forgiveness after I give into temptation.
NO MORE going to bed at night feeling like I just ruined the day and just wanting to dissapear into nothing until I could have God's grace of a new day.
NO MORE looking back on yet another year past of viewing porn and wondering when I will ever stop.  If I will ever stop.  What will happen if I get caught.
NO MORE running to the computer as soon as I get alone.
NO MORE feelings of worthlessness, depression and malaise from having wasted time I KNOW I could have spent doing a million other more productive things.
NO MORE wasted time, effort, energy.
NO MORE lying to my wife about ""I hate porn it's gross!""
NO MORE having trouble with viewing women as nothing but sex objects and running home to find some pornstar who even remotely resembles the girl I just talked to so I can fantasize and jerk the gerchin again.
NO MORE! NO MORE!  NO!  I've had it!  This ends NOW.  

If you are still here, thanks for reading I guess.  I really hope that this forum and the noFap forum are a genuine help.  I know how incredibly difficult this is going to be -- I made it three weeks once back in Jan. and then I gave into temptation and felt miserable about it...but also though ""well I just blew it anyway, so I might as well just give in again and again because I can't stop anyway.""

The stories of sucess really are encouraging so if anyone has anything they want to share, I'm all ears.

I got a huge erection and I quickly found myself fighting the urge to jerk it and blow my load that had accumulated for the past 36-days. I ended up wrestling with myself, telling myself reasons that I should fap (36 days is already a victory, you'll get blue balls if you don't, you need to relax after having that girl at that party tease you, etc.). I finally told myself that all those rationalizations were a bunch of bullshit and I gathered the will to at least not masturbate.

I wasn't going back to any sort of old habit. *I had never been on /gonewild before in my life.* By the time I discovered Reddit the idea of looking at nudes of pretty girls no longer excited me.

1335399521.0,19,self.pornfree,ssp20,How Porn Affects Me: The Girl,40,21,53,http://www.reddit.com/r/pornfree/comments/ssp20/how_porn_affects_me_the_girl/,"Hi Reddit,
I discovered this subreddit a little while ago and thought I would share how the subject of porn affects my life as a teenage girl.

The most harsh and obvious way I can express how porn affects me is that it makes me feel suicidal.
By ""makes me feel suicidal"", I mean ""increases my want to harm myself"", which I have tried and luckily stopped myself from doing many times.

It makes me feel suicidal to know how difficult it will be to find a guy who doesn't like porn or use it, when this is very important to me. Porn is degrading to women at its very core and harms both genders. It is an industry built on insecurity.

It makes me feel suicidal to know my guy friends, teachers, doctors, and even father use porn. To know that a man who should be either an equal, such as a classmate, or someone who has control over my life, such as a teacher, can stomach (and masturbate to) images of women being treated subhuman.

I've battled quite a few difficult things in my life, most specifically serious medical issues. There are days when I feel as though pushing through those issues was not worth it to be a part of this world, a world quite often ruled by porn.

This is a highly misogynistic world. This ""Western Misogyny"" as I call it revolves around the porn culture.
I know that my value as a girl and as a woman is very small, and I truly believe that this is mainly because of porn.

No matter how nicely I take care of myself: wear makeup, shave, do my hair, whiten my teeth, wear nice clothes- even though I do many of these things for myself- I know I have almost no worth to men of the world.
If I meant anything, if any of us women meant anything to the general collection of men (and by this, I mean the vast majority, as I don't use absolutes) the use of porn would no be so prevalent.

In my opinion, one of the worst parts of this widespread porn use is female misogyny: other women judging ""sentimental"" women like me because I CARE about my worth as a HUMAN.

To everyone who tells me to ""deal with it"" and ""put up with"" something that deeply emotionally upsets me:
Don't tell me it's ""natural."" Don't tell me it's a man's ""right"" to watch porn, to view other women's bodies-NO ONE has a right to that woman's body but her.

Don't tell me porn isn't personal. From what I've read, ejaculating creates a chemically emotional link to what you view/think of when you ejaculate. I'm sure many of you on this subreddit have read similar information.

And especially don't tell me porn is okay because it is fake. Those actresses are real women who were once girls like me. Many of them have serious problems that led them down the path of acting in porn. 

There have been times in my life where I have considered becoming part of pornographic material, and these times have always been when I was very low- times when I was so starved for love and attention that I would do anything to get it, times when my body image was leading to mild anorexia (or situational, I would occasionally starve myself), and times when I wanted to kill myself.

I may sound dramatic, but you may need more of my point of view to understand. I am also an older sister and a cousin, and it is unsettling to me that girls are growing up with these problems I couldn't even work past. I'm ""dramatic"" because I care.

I don't know if anyone will read this, or if this really makes sense.
If anyone wants to hear more of my point of view, I would love to share. It feels good to get this off my chest.

I don't want to ""speak"" for other people, but I know many viewpoints that I can give insight to: the insight of many average, and beautiful girls who deserve a world where they have more worth than what we have now.

If you all would be interested in such viewpoints, if it could give you all insight, or help anyone, I am more than willing to share more of my thoughts. Also, keep working on being pornfree, everyone, I truly believe your world will be better.

tl;dr? Porn is bad, please actually read what I wrote? 
This is my first post ever, so tell me what I'm doing wrong and I'll fix it.

1373470428.0,16,self.pornfree,1i0gmj,My Story,19,3,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/pornfree/comments/1i0gmj/my_story/,"We've all had stories. Some involve breakups, others involve relationships that are falling apart and at their edge point, and still others aren't even in relationships. I'm in the latter. I suppose, I'll just type things out and see where this goes.


There is my badge. Yes, it is quite something. Even more interesting, this is my second attempt at Pornfree, my first lasting around 73 days. I have read on here for quite a bit, and you may have seen me comment on a shit ton of posts, so yeah, I do my best to give advice, and it seems people appreciate that, so I appreciate their appreciation. Part of the reason that maybe I haven't relapsed as much as others is because of the duration. Let me explain: Many of you guys are around 20's, 30's, and even 40's, so this addiction to porn has been around for a decade or two. My addiction? It's only lasted a measly 5 years, *but* it escalated quite quickly because I was born into a more modern age, so I would probably be viewing a lot of hardcore stuff that you guys may have viewed in the past. Oh yeah, it was bad, always tends to almost go illegal, won't post specific categories, but needless to say, being pretty young, was not a good impact on myself.


I am 16. I say that sometimes here and there, but this post is about me. So, my addiction did not last as long, but it escalated almost as bad as the rest of you, so maybe that accounts to something. I was able to stop it, I can't help but wonder if this was made even slightly easier for me because I haven't been dependent on it so much.


I was molested when I was 5 by a family relative (Yeah, it's been brought to course, my family knows, this isn't some dark secret I'm spilling to you guys, it's been resolved years ago) So, I was exposed to a dark side of sexuality. Now, when only several years later I began to get hooked onto porn, that just, did not go well at all. And my addiction escalated, so seeing those rape scenes, as well as potentially illegal stuff I won't describe. The 'dopamine haze' porn gives you helps numb emotions, but at times that wasn't enough to stop my misery. And with this challenge, this time there was no 'haze' to help me out, those emotions came back, much stronger, much more intense, and much darker indeed. But every dark tunnel has a light at the end (That's a definition of a tunnel, a two-sided way, otherwise we'd be talking about a ditch or..ok I'll move on) and I have been feeling the light almost every day now (Not high or anything, lol). Today happens to be my Day 90 of Nofap, and I intend to continue.


Like with all 'success' stories, the mentality of former addicts does change over time, and that has changed with me too. Many things have changed, I suppose I'll start listing them now. First, the views on women. I felt bitter towards them, because a lot in real life, weren't the friendliest with me. I was depressed, wanted attention, and I got attention, the negative kind. I was not only pitied by girls, but told I have problems, and life wasn't fun. There was no suaveness in me around women, there was no 'league' I could be with. If there was a league, I'd be below everyone else, I'd be in my own. See, that kind of dark and self-pity feeling was with me for so long, and I had no idea porn would have such an influence, or perhaps be the actual main cause for all that. Because, without porn, I no longer have that feeling. That's something that changed. Not to mention, I can talk to girls much better now, I see them in a more humane and non-sexual way (Not the ones at my school, but elsewhere). There is that debate about how guys complain how girls are so different, and then others say 'Oh no, they are really not that different at all, just treat them like humans and you'll be fine'. In a way, it's not so black and white there. They *are* different, at least from a lot of the guy friends I have, and I appreciate that difference. What I've found is, it's good to treat them like people, but in a way you can't expect that nice treatment back. If that happens in return, that is a reflection of her being a nice person, and a friendship can form. Speaking of friendships, at first I wanted something sexual, then I simply wanted to be friends. Now, I've had the latter, and I'm very happy with that progress. This is something I never thought would ever happen, talking to girls that didn't pity me or else ignore me. That is such progress that can't be measured.


Other changes: So there covers my views on women, what else? I was far less irritated with others, and have no social anxiety. I have confidence now, and actually am much more social than before. Even my friends are relieved, they can see it, and so could everyone else, who only saw the PMO me. They know something's better apparently in my life, and I know it too. I used to isolate myself, a natural reaction to loneliness, but not the cure, and it only worsens the pain. That doesn't happen to me anymore. Back to when I was molested (It wasn't a rape scenario, but I don't want to specify any more detail), I had quite the pain with sexual feelings. Now, that pain is finally cured, therapy couldn't do it, and friends couldn't help. Not even talking with girls would help things out, porn was the problem, and this was the solution.


There are some other forms of progress that I can describe, but wouldn't say is possible (If at all for some of you) unless you either go a long long way into this challenge, or else it may not be possible at all. This doesn't come down to bragging either. I see some troll links sometimes (The ones that I can tell that are written in English, I report right away). That desire and excitement to view porn? Now it's utter disgust, I almost puke at the idea. As for the other tougher troll links (Sometimes written in different languages), I can click on, not out of curiosity, but to see exactly...I guess it should be obvious but I mean, the mentality I had was different. Then I see it less than a millesecond and close out, so quickly would I exit that I don't even remember the site or the images that flashed on the screen. By the way, I have been doing my best to report the occasional troll link, usually I see them minutes after they are posted and report them so you guys don't have to see them :) Another 'odd' benefit, I can go to omegle and not be tempted with the people there. I've actually found a couple friends there that are girls, and we talk in a non-sexual way. Mostly because of how we met, they were suicidal, not to mention, they are pretty but to me they aren't my type, and that shows the friendships I have with them are not shallow. So yeah, I have convinced quite a few people (Not just girls) to not be suicidal, it's no easy task, especially with the 'asl' and occasional women that have sites leading to cam sites, but I don't get the temptation there. I can read NSFW stories without getting turned on by them (And I'm saying from users' sexual experiences, I don't read 'text porn' or anything), almost like...how a doctor would examine a patient with gore and not be flinching. Something like that.


Oh yeah, sorry need to list one more change. This format is probably very shitty and long. Anyway, it comes back down to relationships. My views on them have changed. This is my advice: The more emotionally intimate you are with someone, the more physically intimate you will be as well. Yeah, that means commitment, but when you date around, instead of sleeping (With all that sexual adrenaline pumping in), if you really like the other person, then with time you will see something in them more than a cum receptacle, and I think people would really benefit if they waited for sex than diving in. Now, it seems typical to have sex on a first date, I think that's regretable, if the person behaves weirdly the next day, than when you first met, that's a problem, then you see him/her for who s/he is, and vice versa, and that's probably not a great feeling unless you know the person really well, which doesn't come in a first date. What else has changed on my views on relationships? Yes, for the users on here that are in relationships suffering with a porn problem. Originally, I would be pissed off, very. I couldn't understand why, with a *willing partner right in front of you*, would porn have to be a resort? I guess a bunch of emotions were flowing at the time, but loneliness and pain were the strong ones, so I just, didn't see other than that maybe they were actually willing to find other ways of sexual gratification, and that there partner isn't enough. Now, the views have changed. The answer, it's not so black and white, I believe *to an extent* that the partner is not enough for sexual gratification, but that's not because the user doesn't like the partner, the porn wires them to only have libido with porn, rather than sex in real life. I also have a much calmer attitude with almost all the users on here (I think, though you can tell me if I'm wrong). I realize, in some ways, it's 'easier' to have a partner there with you for support, but in ways harder because that pain is shared between you two. For me, the only support I've had was my own, the only shoulders I could cry on were my own...but what made it easier was that no one else shared this burden. So, there is nothing that makes recovering from this sexual addiction any easier, because the only cure for it, *time*, is not easy. It's really annoying, and you have to develop patience. So I can actually see, either way, porn is a complete piece of fuck that's unfuckworthy.


Most success stories would involve getting laid (I hate that term) or finding women being interested in them. That hasn't happened to me in a way. Women viewing you in public and wanting to approach, that hasn't happened to me. I have great peripheral vision so I can usually tell if someone's looking interested in me, but since that hasn't happened maybe I don't know what it looks like when someone is interested in me. But I""m also 16, so yeah, that might help explain since I'm not even an adult yet. But yeah, I have made progression and I can say confidently I don't have an addiction anymore. Even though the badge has not been as long as others, each day is getting easier and easier. This is no longer a challenge for me, and I can actually do NoFap too. What would I describe this recovery as? NoOrgasm. That isn't to say I'm superior to others on here, no, just, that dopamine and sexual excitement, I haven't had that in a very very long time, nor do I expect it to happen anytime soon..or at all, but now I have the confidence and acceptance that sex isn't all there is to this life.


Thank you all for reading this, and I'd like to conclude with a metaphor of porn. It's not 'sexy beer' or 'forbidden candy', that's not what porn is. For most addicts, substances can be ok, if used in moderation. There is no sense of moderation with porn. Even those that use porn occasionally see much more improvement when cutting it out completely from their lives, such as better sex drive, happier emotions overall, no shame, and better social interaction. So, the proper analogy to porn is, that it's 'sex heroin'. Can heroin be used moderately? Not that I know of. Also should mention I think some users here think that it is a heroin addiction, since they have used heroin and it likely has the same effect on their brains, and I think that there was a study somewhere showing it actually does have the same affects on our brains like heroin. So, no wonder this challenge is nearly impossible. Key word is *nearly* because I am free of it, and you guys can be too. It took time for the addiction to develop, so it will take time for the addiction to go away. But remember, it is possible, and that possibility increases each and every day. :) Thanks for reading all this.",,False,,t5_2rglh,False,,month8,True,t3_1i0gmj,http://www.reddit.com/r/pornfree/comments/1i0gmj/my_story/,

Quitting for good.,24,5,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/pornfree/comments/1f46es/girlfriend_found_out_about_porn_quitting_for_good/,"So I've been trying to quit porn for quite a while now, yet I always find myself relapsing. I'm doing great, yet one thing leads to another, and I find something that triggers me to want to look at porn (Usually, reddit posts with NSFW always itch my curiosity). I end up going from bikini pictures, to topless, to something a little more, to eventually realizing that I've lost my battle. I can usually last about 2 weeks, before I start getting urges, and I have real difficulties lasting a month (please ignore my flare. I was using reddit without loggin in for the longest time...)

I'm a very reserved guy, and my porn addiction stems back to elementary school. In short, I always felt I've been given the short stick in life. I was never accepted, never felt loved, and always left out. I would find out about parties/get-togethers after pictures appeared on facebook. I would always be the one in class sitting without a partner, since luck always had it that my class sizes were odd numbers. I would be the awkward person that had to form a group of 3. There were times when I wanted to be invisible and not exist, only because I hated who I was. I didn't want to be myself. I despised reality.

That's when I discovered porn. For the first time, I felt ""loved"". Beautiful women were stripping ""for me"", but most importantly, they weren't rejecting me. It felt good. I loved that shot of adrenaline, and the amazing feeling that came from the dopamine. It became a drug. I was hooked. 

As I grew older, and I found out that porn is bad, I tried to lay it off. I would say to myself that I'm not addicted, that I CAN lay it off, yet I had difficulties doing so. It's been an uphill battle since then, with many defeats, yet many victories as well. This leads us to where I am at today.

I've been dating the most amazing girl I could imagine. I've gone from friend, to best-friend, to friendzone, to finally breaking out and becoming her boyfriend. We've been dating for about 8 months now. She means everything to me, and I can't imagine losing her. Likewise, I mean a lot to her, and she can't imagine what it would be like without me. 

However, I've always kept my porn addiction hidden from her. I didn't want her to know. This was an embarrassment. So I never told her about it... till yesterday. We were watching a youtube video, which had a thumbnail of boobs in a bikini. She asks, ""did you ever watch porn?"" I love her so much, that I cannot lie to her. I know that I cannot lie, since she WILL find out sooner or later. So I bit the bullet, and said, ""Yes, I've watched it, but I try not to."" I could see the look of pain in her eyes, and that's when I realized that I've been hiding porn under the carpet for too long. I shouldn't be looking at naked women, yet alone when in a relationship. This is when reality struck me. I need to change. 

This raised a couple old memories of her abusive ex-boyfriend (I'm the polar opposite of him), but she never told me exactly what those memories were. I'm under the impression that she tried to get him off of porn, but didn't succeed. He then turned to weed instead to satisfy his cravings. My girlfriend was devastated when she thought of something similar happening to me. I tried to explain that I still am the very same person she fell in love with. Nothing has changed with me, nor will anything change. However, because of her past, she cannot instinctively believe me. 

Since yesterday, she has been very upset, and perhaps devastated. I told her about my past, and my justification for turning to porn. But like she said, ""that doesn't make it good."" I know for a fact that she is not going to break up with me, and that she wants to help me through this. However, I don't know how to explain that quitting isn't going to be a one-time thing. She has never seen porn herself, and considers it equivalent to cheating. She is absolutely disgusted by porn, and her idea of quitting is just saying ""no."" However, I can't say the same for myself. As such, no matter how much I try to explain, she's just devastated and upset. 

That's why I've made the decision. I'm not going to be wishy washy about it. I'm going to go full force, and work for this, just like I had to work for everything else in my life. I'm quitting porn. Once and for all. It will make my relationship stronger, shatter any false beliefs about women, and only make me appreciate my girlfriend even more. I've set up K9 on my computer, and had her set the password. 

I really can't do this alone. Hence why I'm turning to this subreddit. I would appreciate any support you guys can give me. I am determined to save my relationship with my girlfriend, and shatter my relationship with porn. Thank you for reading this.

like many of you i was first exposed to internet porn at the very beginning of puberty and it has played a detrimental role in my life ever since. my parents caught me when i was entering my teen years, i didn't know about internet history, it was '98. sadly my parents weren't tech savy enough to do something about it to block my access other then take my word that id never do it again. problem was i was hooked and i got more tech savy so problem solved, right?

i was awkward around girls all through my teens, didn't try very hard, if at all. somehow, against all odds, i met a girl near the end of my teenage years. we fell in love, blah blah blah, sex ect things were peachy, i was healthy both physically and mentally. porn had all but disappeared from my life. 

we didn't see each other for a year due to some logistics regarding where our parents lived. so we did what any young in love couple does ""the long distance relationship"". it's not easy. i fell on porn hard. 

she made sacrifices to move to where i was to be with me. she loved me more then i could have imagined at the time. i was an entitled teenager(19). in reality she should have left me, she didn't. our work/school hours enabled me to view porn for a few hours a day if i pleased, i did. 

my expectations of her  became warped and completely out of touch with reality. our sex life deteriorated for a few reasons, communication was our main problem. porn was my main problem, i just didn't know it then. 

she stayed with me through thick and thin, good times and the bad. 

we've been together for roughly a decade now and our sex life has its ups and downs. i think mostly because of me and porn, things got as fucked up as they did. 

last fall i almost lost her. it was probably the first true suffering my spoiled first world ass has ever experienced.  

in the aftermath of what happened i came clean about my porn habit and some other personal drama from the years. ironically she doesn't believe me that porn can be addictive or all that problematic. but i know the truth. 

i've been clean for a week or more in the past and have felt better, so i've seen the light. im a week clean now as i type this and i hope that by getting it off my chest into the open it will help me stay clean for a week longer and then more after that. 

the most powerful thing i have read here in this forum is ""I am X and I do not look at porn"" 

Ive dealt with other issues but kicking porn has been the hardest. If only i'd listened to my parents on that day in '98. 

im doing this for her and for us but above all im doing this for my self. i do not want to live life as an addict.

3) A few New Years Eves ago I was late getting to my then girlfriends house trolling females off craigslist...

4 ) 2 1/2 years ago my apartment was a mess, and a girl I was meeting up with, things segweid to going to my apartment, and the embarassment of the mess that got out of control because I was viewing porn.

5) Maybe 15 years ago, avoided hanging out with an ex-girlfriend I met (ironically) at a strip club to be alone, chill and watch porn.

Well this morning at the bus stop, a rather attractive well dressed girl was waiting also and she glanced at me with what I perceived as a dismissive look. The *VERY FIRST* thought in my mind was: ""she's a f_cking c_nt"" had it been a guy my first thought would have been ""Oh thank god he doesn't want to bore me with inane conversation."" 

I always rationalized this attitude towards women as just my *reptillian* brain being obnoxious, as women as a whole I think are better than men in many ways and I've never EVER thought about a woman that I know in that way.


Then it clicked.


I'm viewing women as objects, as things that exist to bring me pleasure. The reason I'm doing this is because of porn, because I've looked at it my entire life and had very few if any *REAL* relationships. 

This realization knocked the wind out of me, because this attitude I have must permeate my entire life. It means that just the way i carry myself, the way I look at women, my body language what words I choose to use are being colored by this distorted view of humanity. 

So tell me, if I can get my brain rebooted, if I can get this addiction under control, will my baser thoughts adapt as well? The thought that they wont makes me shudder.

It was that they found me attractive. I could play out porn fantasies with myself and guys on cams that no woman I know would ever even consider without being paid. Yeah, it seemed to get that bad.

I'm just so fucking over it... its just a way to destroy myself now.

First of all, let me thank you for being a community not only for me to gain inspiration to keep going, but also I want to congratulate you all for taking this step forward in your life! I will try to be brief, as I get carried away when I type these kinds of posts and reports.

After years of being addicted to porn and having it interfere in my previous relationship, I decided enough was enough and confessed my addiction to my friends via FB notes (I am studying abroad, so I could not say it to them in person). The general support I received was tremendous, and my friendships have more or less been strengthened by it. 

Since I took porn out of my life, I decided to look at other aspects in my life and see what I needed to fix, which turned out to be a lot of things - being overweight, not eating well, spending too much time on useless things, and not feeling any kind of desire and passion for anything, hobbies, career goals or women.

I quit watching porn before my family came to visit me and things have been getting better from there. I have since switched to a healthy diet, lost about 12 pounds via exercising, and generally have had a better attitude towards my family, friends, roommates, and general peers. 

I still have a long way to go, but freeing yourselves from the chains of porn and instant gratification makes life worthing living again. I smile more, talk more, follow my interests, and take better care of myself. Music means something to me again, I like to dance more, and I just feel much better about everything. For once in my life, I have hope. A hope to make myself who I want to be and to help others become better too once I can provide the example. 

I will say that I have had one slip up in this 45 day period by seeing one GW pic (the girl was actually fully clothed) but the consequences affected my Nofap streak more than here. I have since learned what triggers me and how to either avoid them or meditate through them. 

As a man with genetic depression, being porn free has done more for me than any drugs I have ever had to take. It is as if this makes me more alert, attentive, and happier than Wellbutrin, Zoloft or the other drugs I was cycled through.

My advice - Don't give up your journey to be porn free, and try to find something that means a lot to you - be it focusing on areas in your life you want to fix, helping others and friends with things they need help in, or just finding new things that excite you. 

You have actively decided to become a better person by dropping the porn. We all fall, and that is life. But those who fail are those who stop trying. Do not stop trying; keep pushing yourself, even if it is in small steps and a day by day basis. Even after the reboot in your brain, don't stop progressing! Make yourself the man or woman you want to be, not the ones society dictates to you. It is your life and choices - make them count!

Thank you for reading. Once again, I got carried away :P If you ever want support or just someone to talk to, PM me. I am always looking for new friends, whether they are on the internet or in real life. 

Good luck, r/pornfree! I will report back soon :)

1355872664.0,18,self.pornfree,152sac,A Sense of Sexual Entitlement,23,5,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/pornfree/comments/152sac/a_sense_of_sexual_entitlement/,"We all agree that porn changes us, in drastic ways and some not-so-drastic. I had no idea how deeply porn affected me until I quit. I apologize in advance for the wall of text.

Rewind to about a year and a half ago. My wife and I had our first kid. A physically and emotionally traumatic birth, as well as some psychologically traumatic events that followed shortly thereafter, left my wife emotionally reeling. Aside from the usual healing time required after childbirth, we didn't have sex for around 4-5 months. Not only was she never in the mood, but when we tried, it was painful for her.

I was frustrated. I deserved sex, and held it against her that she was denying me. Beyond that, my self confidence was damaged. Why was I suddenly so unattractive to her? 

I would read stories on Reddit and elsewhere about couples with vigorous sex lives and be intensely jealous. That's what I want! That's what I deserve! And I invariably used that as an excuse to bury my feelings in binges of PMO.

Even when we started having sex again, it was maybe once a month, and that was almost worse... I have physical needs, and sex is an important part of marriage. Aside from physical needs, I know I derive emotional intimacy from the physical act of sex, and I felt she was denying our marriage that emotional connection. I grew more and more resentful, but kept pushing it down and hiding it.

We talked about it a couple of times, and there was always a part of me that knew I needed to be understanding. The kind of emotional trauma she'd been through takes a long time to heal from. I tried not to make her feel guilty or coerce her into something I knew she wasn't ready for. But while I thought I was being a good, dutiful husband, I was hurting our marriage far more than I realized.

It wasn't until I stopped watching porn (yes, I obviously still relapse from time to time) that I realized a few very important things:

1) **Sex is not some inalienable right.** It is a privilege that flows from a healthy relationship (at least, in my framework). Whatever your framework, if one participant is not willing, it gives you no right to be angry at that person.

This was a gradual realization over a couple of weeks, but I noticed my frustration and resentment gradually disappear. My desire never lessened (in fact, it increased), but I no longer felt entitled to release. If it happened, amazing! If not, I'll deal.

2) **My shift in thinking was so gradual I couldn't see it, but she could.** A couple of weeks later, my wife blew me away with a simple question: ""Why are you being so nice to me lately?""

Huh? I didn't think I'd been treating her any differently. In fact, I had been very careful not to.

But I was wrong. She is very emotionally incisive, and she knew something was wrong, even if I tried to hide it. 

3) **What I watched and read about others' sexual exploits became normative to my sexuality**, apart from my actual relationship. As my standards and expectations drifted farther from hers, it increased friction in our daily relationship. As soon as I re-aligned, this friction all but disappeared.

4) **I better appreciate just how lucky I am.** My wife is amazing in many ways, which I will not get into in too much detail here. Needless to say, she is far better than any group of pixels, or even any other flesh and blood woman could ever be. And she's all mine. =)

I would push play and they would invite me in without reservations. For that brief moment throughout my day i was welcomed and wanted.

It hasn't been an entirely smooth journey but then after 20 years it wouldn't be. I reset my counter a few days ago having browsed an image site and found myself absent mindedly searching for images of one of my old favourite pornstars. It just shows how vigilant you have to be, this addiction is extremely cunning and insidious, ready to pounce at any moment of weakness.

I have had such a complex relationship with porn, at once intensely excited and profoundly repulsed by it. How can those two reactions coexist? It's bizarre frankly, perhaps it demonstrates the conflict between the reptilian and primate parts of the brain, the unconscious and the conscious.

I have read a lot about addiction and dopamine, less about the release of the bonding hormone oxytocin during orgasm which would perhaps account for my attachment to a small number of pornstars over the years. I almost felt that I knew these girls and felt real affection and empathy for them. All the while watching them being subject to all manner of indignities (and wishing it was me doing the subjecting). I miss them now I guess, almost like one would miss an ex girlfriend. What tricks our brains can play on us!

Throughout my addiction and in spite of my considerable consumption of pornographic content I have never had any time for apologists for the porn industry. While I don't doubt that there are some performers who have enjoyed good experiences of working in  the industry I highly doubt if this is common. Female performers are frequently mistreated in all sorts of ways on camera and while this might be broadly speaking an act, nevertheless it can't be good for their self esteem or for male attitudes to women. This is not to mention high levels of STDs, unwanted pregnancies, drug addiction and the like. Speaking as the father of three daughters I can think of few things worse than my girls getting mixed up in that world.

Furthermore I can personally testify to the profoundly negative effect that compulsive consumption of porn can have on sensitive individuals like myself. This may not be true for everyone of course but my self esteem has taken such a battering over the years. How could I look my loved ones in the eye knowing what I was getting up to at almost every opportunity. I have lied to and neglected those I hold most dear in all the world, I have let myself and them down. No more.

So all power to those of us who are seeking to voluntarily opt out of the viewing of this addictive and pernicious content, it can only be a good thing. I for one am feeling so much better already.

I'm not disagreeing with the fact that sex is important to a healthy lifestyle/relationship and that we do have desires that demand fulfillment, I disagree with the word ""needs."" We talk about the ""needs"" we have as a way to justify our infidelity, our dishonesty, or selfishness, and most tragically our capacity to cause harm to others and ourselves (""I can't be expected to ignore my needs just because I'm in a relationship,"" ""I wasn't getting it at home so I went elsewhere for it,"" ""I'm only human and I can't resist temptation because of my needs,"" etc.). By declaring our sex drives as ""needs"" we give ourselves a ""get out of jail free card"" when it comes to being unfaithful to ourselves or others. Seriously, how many times have you relapsed because you ""just couldn't take it anymore,"" you're only human, right?

I can't tell you how many times I have been unfaithful to myself and those I love because of my so called needs ""forcing"" me to watch porn so I could get my rocks off. I treat PMO as far more important than my own well being or my relationship with my girlfriend because while self-esteem and committed relationships are good and all, they aren't part of my ""needs.""

So I'm here tonight to say fuck my ""needs,"" I don't need porn. Porn and this lust obsessed world have taken sex (something natural, healthy, and enjoyable) and have turned it into a golden calf, and I don't want to worship it any longer. I want to have a healthy sex life that is focused on bettering myself and bettering my relationship, I do NOT want to have a sex life based on fulfilling my so called needs.

Can you imagine a world where you **didn't** think about sex all the time? I can't, I haven't been successful enough in this endeavor to feel a peaceful detachment from lust (not sex, lust) but I hope to some day. I started here because I wanted to stop watching porn, but I'm continuing here because I want to change the way I think. I don't want to be constantly eyeing up every woman on the sidewalk, I don't want to think about people in a sexual manor only, I want to be able to look at myself in the mirror without being ashamed of the things I've done to satisfy my ""needs."" Essentially, I just want to stop thinking about sex every god damn second so I can actually see the world without this ""Needs"" filter.

Can you guys help me out for a minute?,22,5,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/pornfree/comments/1i98v8/my_husband_is_a_porn_addict_getting_help_can_you/,"First of all, I want to say ""nice job"" to all of you here. I come here to understand what it's like to be a porn addict, and I admire you all for trying to improve yourselves and working on it.  

A little background. My husband of 7 years is addicted to porn. 4 years ago it came up, he said he would stop, but he didn't. Now we're getting marriage counseling, he's getting help, etc. He is very remorseful and truly wants to change and I believe he can. I've been going through my own healing process and trying to work through my emotions. I've gotten hung up on one issue.

Everything I have read says that porn addiction has nothing to do with the spouse/partner. Everything I've read says it has nothing to do with the attractiveness of the spouse/partner. He tells me the same thing. I really want to believe him. It just doesn't compute, you know? It seems to me that if you've got a willing, live body sharing a bed with you every night, the only reason you would turn that down for porn is if the girls in porn are more attractive. I know the emotional reasons why he's turned to porn. I get all the logic. But I feel so worthless, so fat, so ugly. I feel like I've been repeatedly rejected in my marriage because my looks weren't as good as the girls in the videos. It doesn't help that I'm overweight (working on it). I worry that he's just too nice of  a guy to tell me, ""Yes, they're hotter than you, and that's a part of the problem."" 

Is there anything you can tell me to help me understand that this is not about a partner's attractiveness? Any analogies? Comparisons? Links to sites that explain? Anything at all. I want our marriage to survive this and I think it's important for my healing that I try to understand, even if the truth will hurt.

tl;dr --My husband says this problem has nothing to do with my level of attractiveness, and I'm having a hard time understanding how attractiveness isn't related.

I have been dealing with addictions for many years, having recently passed the 20 year mark for being alcohol/drug free. I have found that it's all too easy for me to just pick up a different manner of over-indulging after facing the current  problem. Seems that sex started being a real obsession for me after getting clean. 

For me, sex is the ultimate high and like any true drug addict, once I got a taste, I wanted more more and then more. Being in a committed, monogamous marriage has perks but it has it's drawbacks also. Number one being that my wife wants sex less and less as the years go by. 

I found a whole new world in online, high-speed internet porn that I could escape to for hours on end and be with women who wanted sex with **me** in any shape or fashion that I desired. Except that it was only a fantasy world and not real.

I became obsessed and preoccupied with sex. Every woman who crossed my path became a potential partner/victim for me. *I confused fantasy and reality*. I almost believed that any woman who showed me a bit of kindness or attention wanted me. 

After becoming aware of this addiction I decided that I did not want to be the person I had become. I decided to try something different.

How very tempting it is, still, to go and indulge myself and to leave reality and the pain and problems of life behind. Some days I feel like I'm walking on the razor' s edge, just that close to relapsing into old behavior. When that happens I just tell myself, ""not today"" or even ""not NOW"". I don't have to give up anything for forever; that's too big for me.

Today I am learning to feel and to let the uncomfortable feelings just be. They say, ""Through pain comes growth"". I have to ""go through"" the feelings rather than ""around them"" as I have done for many years.

I am blessed to say that I have been porn free for six months today.

1372345192.0,17,self.pornfree,1h6jew,My Quitting Porn Story,21,4,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/pornfree/comments/1h6jew/my_quitting_porn_story/,"This is a story about how porn and masturbation nearly ruined my life.It all started with porn.

My first experience with porn was from a magazine my nanny masturbated to in front of me when I was 8 years old.I was curious and shamed to see her do that.I realized it was something taboo and from then onwards, I always sneaked into her room to look at those images thrilled, not sexually-but by the illicit feeling an 8 year old gets by looking at naked bodies doing these...strange things to each other.I got a boner too,but never realized what it meant. Well, I got addicted to the thrill and it was all fun and games till I hit puberty and discovered masturbation/fapping.I was instantly hooked and I consumed porn and masturbated copiously all through my teens.

About nine years ago, as a sophomore in college, I tried quitting pornography and masturbation when I realized that I could only go out on dates and be confident around women when I hadn’t masturbated or watched porn for over a week. Desperately wanting to date more women and get into a relationship, I experimented with abstaining from pornography for longer and longer periods. It worked, till I made a decision quit it completely. To my dismay, I couldn’t. Six years later I was still trying. Each time I failed myself, I could feel my low self esteem digging its roots deeper and deeper into my psyche.

Needless to day, my college dating experience was terrible. Longs nights of striking out ended consistently with me going online for my fix. As I experimented with drugs and alcohol, I got deeper into my addiction, requiring more and more bizzare scenes and niches of porn to satisfy my dulled senses. I read every book I could find on quitting, got counseling, confessed at church(yes,I was a Catholic) Masturbation and pornography became as common to me as taking a leak. Work, school, church, a friends house, now where was off limits. Whenever I felt stressed or let down, I knew I could count on a quick fap session to set me straight.

When I graduated and got a fulltime job at a prestigious communications firm, porn followed me. By this time, I was only sporadically trying to quit and had more or less come to terms with living with porn. Shortly after landing a job, I got into a relationship with a smart, funny and beautiful woman. As sex became routine for me, the true ramifications of my “porn hobby” came to light. I began to see flaws in my girlfriend whom, when I first met was one of the most attractive women I’d ever been with sexually. Little imperfections were regularly under the magnifying glass of my porn trained mind. Everything snowballed from there and before I knew it, I was in bed with another woman performing the very same acts I had viewed on some website. When I came and the exhilaration of illicit sex had passed, I felt absolutely disgusted with myself. Nevertheless, I continued with this philandering behavior till I was almost murdered one night while trying to solicit anonymous sex.That was my wake- up call. I knew I had crossed the line into full blown addiction and maybe even sex addiction. I resolved there and then to quit pornography and masturbation for the last time.

There's a quote floating out there that says “anyone who says pornography addiction does exist, hasn’t tried quitting.”(quitporngetgirls.com). Altogether, it took me eleven years of quitting and relapsing to understand porn addiction, come to terms with it and eliminate it from my life. I discover a I had already lost so much inside me ,that I couldn’t bear to lose those close to me by revealing my debilitating condition. I resolved that I would apply EVERYTHING I had learned in eleven years of struggling to quit in 30 days. There was no reboot, no technique, just a firm desire and a day by day mental plan that I followed.

Quitting masturbation and pornography for a lot of men, in the long run, is a lifestyle decision. Personally, it has been one of the greatest challenges and yet one of the most fulfilling experiences of my life. Perhaps it will be the same for you.I have been porn and masturbation for four years now.I write about my process of quitting and my life as an ex porn addict at quitporngetgirls.com.

This community is one of the best things that will happen to many  guys.As all you ""pornfree"" guys take your challenge to its peak, you will discover an awesome new world of potential in life and relationships.I truly wish you all the best.

I'm home alone (for one of the first times in two weeks) and got one of the biggest cravings since I quit porn. I was pacing back and forth towards and away from my computer, when I realized I simply had to text my fiancée to tell her what I was going through and what my plan of action was.

The funny thing was that as I was typing out the text, the craving subsided considerably. By the time I sent it I felt not only like I didn't crave porn, but also really proud of myself for being honest with my fiancée and deciding not to give in to the craving. She texted me back that she was glad I decided to walk away and tell her instead, even knowing that it would upset/hurt her to hear.

I feel amazing right now; way better than the temporary rush I'd have gotten if I gave in to the craving. Knowing that I had that strength and that I've got someone to talk to who supports me is the most amazing feeling and I just had to share it with you all.

(Possible triggers?),19,3,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/pornfree/comments/1bsp8j/porn_is_cleaning_out_my_bank_account_and_ruining/,"Before you ask about the whole money thing... yes, I know you can get stuff for free, but I was so into it and spent so much time watching it that I always needed to have the latest and greatest, and had to see what ""exclusives"" were available for all of my favourite sites and fetishes.  The first three purchases on my first ever credit card were porn sites.  Once the novelty of paying for porn and realizing that the preview sites were always as good or better than the member pages, I switched to cam sites.  Cam girls are what *really* sucked my money away.  With a pay site you're looking at a maximum of $50 per month, and most will usually subscribe for the month and cancel.  A really good cam girl can milk $200 away from you in a matter of mere minutes.  I remember prematurely maxing out my monthly credit limit on a few occasions because of the $800 I spent in *one week* on a cam site. It's gotten to the point where I'm actually kind of cheap about everything else.  I'll guffaw at the thought of paying $100 for a jacket but will blow $800 to get my rocks off a few times.  It's kind of sad, really.  Were I not making decent coin at work I'd surely be poor by now. I've totalled up my bills and over the past 7 years I have spend close to $9000 between porn and cam sites.

Otherwise I'm a somewhat typical PMO addict although perhaps I engage in it more than the average person and in weirder stuff. An average of 4 times a day on a weekday is not out of the ordinary, and there are some weekends where I'll lock myself in my room quite literally from sunrise to sunset just watching it, although *those* days are over.  Part of my problem was that I got myself caught up in a pro-PMO communities from about the time I was 17 and too shy to make real friends in college.  I forged many online friendships with people based around the fact that we liked to watch porn together.  I can't even count the number of times I've avoided outings with friends/family, ditched plans at the last minute, or left early because I wanted to engage in some PMO. 

As it stands right now I've been on-and-off the pornfree/nofap bandwagon since about August of last year.  I've gone up to 3 weeks without it but inevitably relapse back to once a day for a while before trying again.  I've *only* spent $400 on porn since that time (related to my relapses... sounds silly to say only 400 but for me that's very little).

Lately, however, I've noticed myself going on binges again and sliding back into my old habits.  I can already feel the effects it's having on my relationships and even my career.  That's where this account comes in.  After lurking for many months I've decided to sign up and engage in the community in the hopes that this will help me stay accountable, clean, and one day be able to empower others to win the fight as well.

Reflecting back, in the past three years, I was able to be 100% porn free when I visited my parents. I have no smartphone and did not bring a computer. The other time was when my ex-girlfriend's daughter spent the summer at my apartment. She stayed in the bedroom and I stayed on the couch. I did not want her to see or think of me doing that.

Now knowing this topic can be debatable my understanding of the subject comes from an amazing book called, ""The Power of Habit"". For a thorough understanding of habits and this ingredient I recommend picking up the book.

* **Examples**: If you do research you will find a lot of successful athletes were not in fact prodigy in their field but normal people like you &amp; I. What made them extraordinary was a set of habits they formed to rise to the top, this is something they all share (Michael Phelps, Michael Jordan, Jeremy Lin, Tiger Woods, ext.) Look each of their stories up &amp; see for yourself. Not only did these athletes form habits that took them to the top (intentional or unintentionally) but they all shared one similar mindset that most important mindset that is necessary to be successful with your habit, &amp; that is they **Truly Believed** that they were going to not only make it but be the best of the best! 

* **Example 2**: Tony Dungy was one of the first NFL coaches who believed in the power of habits. During his time, a lot of football teams were influenced by the school of thought that the way to win a game is a series of complex plays. Tony on the other hand believed he could instill a set of simple habits and ingrain them through repetition &amp; create successful teams. His approach to coaching was rejected and he was declined through a lot of interviews. Then came along the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, one of the worst football teams in the history of the NFL at the time. Tony got to work right away at instilling his habits onto each player and their role. Now this isn't a fairytale story they didn't show results right away in fact it seemed like his approach was flawed. You see the players had it set in their mind that they were **losers** that we don't win, that's just the way it is &amp; because of that, the habits were not used to their full potential. One day Tony's son committed suicide &amp; it devastated him, he eventually came back to the field &amp; continued coaching to get his mind off the matter. After losing his son he did not falter in his beliefs, he continued believing he could turn the Buccaneers into a super bowl team. This display of leading by example, had a huge impact on the team, they came to not only see the power of belief but where shown through an admirable example. And as you could imagine things began to change. Now to wrap this up the Buccaneers did win their first Superbowl but unfortunately Tony was fired the year before they had won, but don't worry his role in the Buccaneers was recognized &amp; he ended up having a successful career, as well as changing the way coaches &amp; critiques looked at football. 

* **The Four Minute Barrier**: Before 1954 know one believed a human can run a mile in under 4 minutes. To put simply Roger Bannister didn't accept this belief &amp; made it his mission to disapprove it. As you can imagine by now Roger did successfully surpass the four minute barrier but that wasn't the most amazing part of this story. After Roger surpassed the barrier a wave of people began to surpass the barrier over 20,000 people, even high school students were surpassing it. Not only that but it has now become the standard of all male professional middle distance runners. What changed? people started believing, that's what changed my friend. 

* **Belief**: Now studies show that religious followers have more success with their habits. They like to credit it to their belief in their god, which is fine, but that kind of reason doesn't satisfy social psychologist. As you might guess by now, the will to **Believe** is also a muscle &amp; since religious people already completely believe in something they are better trained in this skill. So if your not religious how do you learn to believe? You might even be say, ""I already do believe in myself."" but do you? If someone came to you with a time machine &amp; told you have to bet your life to see if you achieved your goal in 90 days, would you step through it? This can apply to anything you are trying to achieve, what goal in life outside of this do you strive or don't?

* **Why?**: I am not particularity religious &amp; so I am not fortunate to have that experience in truly believing in something, but it is once i started reading book after book, studying successful people one after another, reading biographies of our ancestors. Did I come to realize that it does not matter what where I came from or what my talents are, or what I have done in the past. That not only can I beat this PMO addiction, but if I want to make my dreams come true, all I need to do is create a set of habits and grind away at them and believe, believe that one day I will make my dreams come true. It is not great people who achieve greatness but normal people who believe they can achieve it. 

* **I Don't Deserve It...**: I've read some terrible stories of lost on these subreddits. People who have lost years of their lives, loved ones, families, &amp; respect. I to have have suffered lost, but lost is lost &amp; I am not here to see who has gone through the worst. If you are under the impression that you don't deserve this (consciously or subconsciously), that you don't deserve to be free of this prison I want you to do me a favor. I want you to write down all your feelings in a note, all of your experiences with PMO, all of your suffering &amp; lost that you have gone through because of your PMO addiction, all of your regret of years lost. Afterwards read it out loud over &amp; over again until your satisfied &amp; then burn it, because you see my friend none of that matters any more, you are here reading this guide &amp; I am here to tell you that it is BECAUSE of that **SUFFERING** that you deserve this, it is BECAUSE of everything you have gone through that you deserve a better life, &amp; it is because you are here trying to better yourself trying to live to your full potential whether you realize it or not that you deserve to be free from this prison. I believe you can do it &amp; I believe you deserve it for whatever that may be worth to you.

In imagining a life without porn, I also imagine who I'll become (who I am already becoming). I'm, you know, a pretty good person overall, and I've never really lied, exaggerated or been generally dishonest about anything in my life except for porn. Not having looked at porn for two weeks means that there is literally nothing I need to hide from the world, from my girlfriend, from my friends in general conversation. This is extremely liberating. 

I find that the sort of mental logistics involved in being dishonest about porn habits can sort of trickle out into other aspects of life. I'm not saying that I would lie about anything else, per se, but knowing that I had the ABILITY to lie kind of fucked with me a little bit. Now, realizing that I had that ability to lie the whole time, I'm realizing that I don't have to use that part of my brain. I can just be honest all the time about everything.

Love is thoughtful
Contact your spouse sometime during the business of the day. Have no agenda other than asking how he or she is doing and if there is anything you could do for them.

Day 5:
Love is not Rude
Ask your spouse to tell you three things that cause him or her to be uncomfortable or irritated with you. You must do so without attacking them or justifying your behavior. This is from their perspective only. 
(This one was hard for me. There where multiple times where I wanted to say, ""well you do this..."" but I had to hold my tongue. This one is a 1-2er it goes back to day one in not saying anything negative.)

My then girlfriend, now ex girlfriend, found out about my issues and very soon after broke up our relationship.

Since then have I tried to quit the whole PMO thing, but, as my badge will tell you, I have not got very far.

However, I do feel that I have taken a few steps in the right direction during the past eleven months. Pretty soon after my addiction was revealed, I started attending the meetings of a 12 step sex addicts group where I have found a bunch of new friends that I can talk to, find support and helt. I realise that my addiction had caused me to isolate myself, become very lonely and not have many friends or acquaintances around. Becoming more sociable is something that I am working on, but I am still taking baby steps.

I also got rid of my 5TB collection of porn and the computer that hosted all that shit. I have read all the stuff on YBOP, Breaking the Cycle and No More Mr Nice Guy, trying to keeping the stuff that I have read in mind.

I have cancelled my broadband internet connection at home. This still seems like a very important step. It has not stopped me from downloading porn (I have had the opportunity to borrow other peoples network connections and I have used them for downloading porn, something that I am ashamed of) but it has stopped me from collecting porn and constantly go hunting for more porn. It has also stopped me wasting hours of online time, be it clicking for porn or other stuff.

All that free time that suddenly is available to me has actually made me do other things. I have started going to the gym (never imagined myself ever doing that a year ago), get proper amount of sleep every night (it used to be a big problem to me before as i could spend half the night doing PMO and the other half of the night laying sleepless in bed due to the rush of PMO and of feeling depressed about my situation), taking many opportunities to meet up with people and doing other things that i consider being living a real life. 

I am also seeing a therapist that is giving me some help in dealing with my issues.

I am very far from being pornfree but I want to say that I am still working on it and I am not giving up. I am still interested in seeing what it is like after 90 days.

But now it's just life. I'm very thankful that I had the /r/pornfree and /r/nofap communities for support. 

Here's my introduction post from 3 months ago for reference:
http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/tge4i/sick_and_tired_of_shame_27m/



My story is similar to most of you here. I became addicted to PMO early in life and I turned to it every time something seemed too hard to handle. I actually managed to quit before but stressful situations would throw me back in the hole.  


My journey to recovery actually started with tragedy.  I dropped my iPad and had to give it to a repair shop in the mall.  As I wandered around, I stumbled into a Barnes &amp; Noble and saw the ""Addiction/Self Help"" aisle. Curious, I walked in and one book caught my eye: ""Breaking the Cycle: Free Yourself from Sex Addiction, Porn Obsession and Shame"". As I read the first chapter describing how someone lost his family and house because of his addiction I almost broke into tears. The scary thing was I could imagine myself in that guy's situation 10 years from now.  I didn't want to hit rock bottom. I needed to take action NOW. 


That's not to say I quit right away. It was a tough process and I relapsed a lot. I had to face my inner demons head on. I still face them daily but now I can mostly ignore them.  This process is different for everyone and I wanted to share my methods which I mostly got from that book. Sorry if this comes off as whoring the book but it helped me so much that I want to share it every chance I get!


**Keep a diary**

For me this served two purposes. First, keeping a diary helped me gather my thoughts and document my triggers. But since I was keeping the diary on my iPhone (using the MyDiary app) it gave me something positive to do when I would have otherwise used my iPhone for porn. I also kept the book as an ebook on my iPhone which helped tremendously. 


**Talk to your addict**

It feels weird at first but anytime I felt the urge I would have a dialog in my diary instead. I named my addict Kid because he makes me do childish things. The most important thing here is to not censor yourself at all.  Eventually it was easy to have a two way conversation. Here's one I had while I was struggling:

&gt;Kid: You know you want to do it. Go to the bathroom and beat your cock while reading a filthy story on your iPhone.
&gt;
&gt;Me: who are you? Why do you want me to do that?  What could I possibly gain from it?
&gt;
&gt;Kid: what do you mean why? Because it feels good. And it's easier than working. You don't want to sit here and fail to solve this problem any longer. 
&gt;
&gt;Me: that's not what I want. I want to sit here and work hard. I came here to work not jerk off to porn in the bathroom. 
&gt;
&gt;Kid: it's what you want!  It's what you always want. It's what feels good.
&gt;
&gt;Me: not today. I can solve this problem without procrastinating any longer. 


**Acknowledge your triggers**

Anytime I felt like I was objectifying or starting to fantasize in a negative way I would do the beard test.  Which means rubbing the back of my hand upward across my cheek to remind myself I'm a man. Obviously this won't work for women but it can be any action as long as its not destructive. Pinching your ear would work too. The point is to acknowledge when you are triggered so you can deal with it.


**Confide in someone**

It could be a friend, family member or spouse. But being able to talk to someone is very helpful during this process. I chose to confide in my brother. I never told anyone before and it wasn't easy but it brought us closer. 


I don't plan on ever watching porn again. As far as NoFap goes I'll keep it up (or down ha!) for a year. After that I can reevaluate my situation.  Hopefully once I'm at 365 days I'll come back and make another post. Until then stay strong my brothers and sisters!  


**tl;dr Keep a diary, have a written conversation with your addict subpersonality, acknowledge when you get triggered and tell someone!**

In addition to fapping, I'm fortunate to have a steady sexual partner, and while there's no denying that those two outlets make this easier, it's unsettling how acutely I can feel the Addiction fighting to get loose.

* Even if I've *just* had an orgasm, my eyes fixate on every woman I see, trying to visually grope them. I've *never* been the type to ogle, but now it's like a magnetic force, and very difficult to resist. (It's even worse online. I had to close Google News today because the front page story was about Jenny McCarthy posing for Playboy again, and contained SFW pics that were still tantalizing.)

* When I *do* masturbate, I often find myself sitting in exactly the same spot where I used to watch porn. There's no porn there anymore, so there's no *reason* to sit there, but my Addiction is desperately trying to feed itself.

For those who wonder why I'm **not** abstaining from fapping and/or sex (especially given the ""chaser"" effect), the answer is simple:

I'm starving out my Addiction, denying it the porn it so desperately wants. As it frantically tries to get a ""fix"", another side effect is the almost constant desire to fap or have sex. So I do. And every time, the porn thoughts/mental images which accompany those acts are a little more faded...a little further in the background. My porn thoughts (which, like most of us, I'd grown to *need* during sex/fapping) are now an occasional intrusion into my ""normal"" sexual thoughts. Hopefully, they'll be even more reduced as time goes on.

I'm fine with pure imagination/fantasy, and I'm obviously fine thinking about the person I'm with.....but the mental replaying of specific porn scenes had to stop. And every time I reach orgasm without them, they get a little bit smaller in my head.

I LOVED IT. I think it really worked, and -- this is what is truly mindblowing -- I think it worked instantly. I have tried all the usual everythings like support groups, taking it one day at a time, tracking days, but the cravings never really went away.

I'm astounded and I really cannot stop raving about this. I used to post on /r/nofap a lot but now I have absolutely no desire to do so. I'm sharing this here and not there because there is a big culture of ""tracking your days"" and ""taking it one day at a time"" going on over there and this probably wouldn't go over too well.

Porn? It's *always* been a part of my life.  I'm 30 now, and I can't think of a period of more than 2 weeks in the last 16 years that I didn't look at porn.  I grew up with the beginnings of the internet, and got in trouble for looking at porn at an early age.  Downloading a fake picture of Jennifer Anniston (this took like 20 minutes back in the day) when my dad walked in got my internet yanked for awhile.  But of course I got it back, and since then it has been pretty consistent.  In fact, it's only gotten worse.

After high school, I went off to college and got deep into porn.  I would masturbate while my roommate slept 10 feet from me.  When I lived on my own, I could spend entire days holed up in my room just watching porn and masturbating.  It has eventually led to pretty standard porn addict complaints: watching porn at the exclusion of real relationships, a shift in priorities to ensure I can watch porn.  Death grip leading to performance issues in real life, coupled with the exclusionary satisfaction it gave me, eventually led to shying away from meeting women and especially trying to become intimate with them.  I never fully gave up, but it's very rare for me to try to instigate any sexual contact with a woman anymore.  

I took the cowards first approach (not necessarily a bad idea, I just knew this wasn't the case) and visited the doctor to make sure my inability to keep it up was not medical.  Prostate fine, but he gave me some pills to try if I wanted (cialis, I think).  I then had a heart-to-heart with my dad, and told him that I was having problems keeping it up with the ladies, and it's been very hard on me (no pun intended), and I don't know what I'm going to do but I may need his help.  I didn't tell him I was addicted to porn, I just said I was having performance problems.  Although stunned, my dad is a good man, and just gave me the standard ""I'm here for you in whatever way you need"".  Unfortunately - I didn't change shit.  Now that I knew it wasn't medical, I just felt defeated - I brought this upon myself!

I've wallowed in the depression of it for 2 years now.  I've told a couple other people much more than I told my dad.  I've never told anybody else in my family.  Of course, everyone wonders what my deal is - I'm an attractive guy, in shape, broad interests and what not - let's just say I get plenty of ""Why don't you have a girlfriend?""  I view depression not as a medical problem, but as an addiction: an addiction to being sad.  Well, I was/am depressed.  I also view my porn habits as an addiction.  They say it's truly an addiction when it negatively impacts your life.  Well, we're there.

3 days ago, I got a letter in the mail from my ISP.  A company tracked me downloading one of their pornos over torrent, and they're going to sue me if I don't settle.  Now, I KNOW this is just a shitty business model - the lawyer works for free in exchange for a hefty percentage on the settlements.  But I also know this is going to cost me over $2000 to squash.  $2000 because I drown myself in porn? That is stupid.  I'm not ok with this.  But I'm not mad at the shady lawyer or the crappy porn company, I'm mad at myself.  Luckily, I can get this taken care of outside of court and never have my name released if I play it correctly.  But rather than downplay the seriousness of the situation just because I can make it go away, I must acknowledge it.  My addiction to porn is **negatively** impacting my life.  

I'm a smart man (pardon my horn-tooting), and I've done plenty of research about addictions, pornography, depression, etc.  I minored in psychology in college, which, although nothing special, at least gives me a solid footing on the ideas and terminology involved.  I tried therapy at one point - I don't like therapy.  Well, it's probably good for others, but it doesn't work for me.  I'm very rational and deliberate about other things in my life.  One of my favorite lyrics: ""If you hate something, don't you do it too.""  I hate porn, so I need to not do it.  The cognitive dissonance has become too much.  I want to love another person, not just myself and a glowing screen.  I want to enjoy sex like other people enjoy sex.  Someone said the other day ""Well, yeah, but a orgasm you give yourself is nothing like an orgasm you have with someone else"", and it made me sad.  I don't even know what that feels like anymore.

Ok, so story's over - wut do?

Simple.  **STOP LOOKING AT PORN**.  Cold turkey.  Done.  I'm not going to debate it, I'm not going to negotiate, I'm not going allow myself to cheat, I'm not going to pretend I'm not cheating by looking at less sexual images for sexual gratification.  Just. Stop.   In fact, I'm 3 days in.  The second I read that letter I knew it was time.  I don't need a buddy, I don't need a therapist, I don't need a program.  I remember I once, maybe 5 years ago tried to just slowly decrease the amount of porn I watched - what an epic failure!  I'm just done with it.  **If** I do lapse, I start again the second the lapse is over.  This is all non-negotiable.  People always talk about strategies, and what you *need* to get over it, but the only thing that matters is that you don't watch porn.  I'm taking the most direct route.

Of course, right now, I'm certainly going through withdrawal symptoms.  I'm irritable - personally and physically.  I haven't slept much, been very tossy-turny.  I definitely have more energy, even though I'm sleeping less.  I haven't increased my intake of any drugs or alcohol, but I do smoke weed fairly regularly and that's been nice for the irritability.  Going to bed has been tough!  But these are all just signs of a good thing.  They say ""Pain is weakness leaving your body"".  Well, I say ""Withdrawal is addiction leaving your body"".

It's crazy, I can't really say I've been clean. But it's getting there.

I didn't feel like an outsider to the people around me. But unfortunately, one week ago I relapsed and relapsed badly.

I used to turn to porn anytime I felt down, anxious, or stressed. I felt that I needed to run away from any problem I had, no matter how tiny it was. Like a lot of people here I started at an early age of 14 since the first family computer. I'm now 26 and have been viewing porn consistently since. My taste started out very innocent with stills of topless women. But as the years went on, and thanks to tube sites my tastes grew more and more disgusting.

I have a very beautiful girlfriend and been together for five years. She knows only a little of my addiction and I really don't want to lose her. Recently our sex life has been in a major drought and when we did have sex, I would always fake an orgasm because I did not get that same feeling as I would get with porn. I am determined to dedicate myself to her and am going to do everything I can to rid myself of this addiction.

As I said at the start, I joined Pornfree a month ago but relapsed a week ago. I have a nightmare of a workplace and recently things for me haven't been going well. This then led me to be depressed, and then porn. I felt that this was my only escape. Since then I have PMO every day.

After laying in bed and thinking for most of the night I have decided today is going to be the day I will stop this addiction. I will take this recent relapse and experience and use it to my advantage. I decided to face my problems head on without porn and when I feel like I have an urge, I'm going to do the things I used to love such as playing my guitar, shooting hoops and getting back into art.

I'm very thankful for the support here and it will make the road to recovery much easier.

Be strong my brothers and sisters! We can do this!

TL;DR Started Pornfree a month ago but relapsed recently. Porn gave me a way to escape. But felt disgusted with my self with the things I used to do. Want to do this for my SO and myself.

I am recruiting new players for **The Valhalla Challenge,** a competitive game to quit porn addiction.

We started out here at /r/pornfree before it was necessary to create our own subreddit. Basically, I write a daily report and if you stay clean, you will remain at the top of the leaderboards. If this sounds appealing to you, you may wan't to find out more by visiting /r/ValhallaChallenge. The rules are written on the sidebar on the right.

I am now recruiting new players to join us for the start of our next round on Sunday. If you are interested, subscribe to /r/ValhallaChallenge and send me a message with the subject line: New Player.

Have a happy new year!

1354069071.0,16,self.pornfree,13ws48,Day #5 - IMPORTANT PROPOSITION -Thanksgiving League Stay Strong Challenge,22,6,61,http://www.reddit.com/r/pornfree/comments/13ws48/day_5_important_proposition_thanksgiving_league/,"Contestants,

So, there has been some talk about improving the rules of the competition in order to satisfy these two conflicting arguments:

- We don't want to shame any of those who give in, and we should allow for second chances

vs,

- We should keep our competitive spirit, and the fear of failure is a strong motivator.

So, after much debate, I have come up with an idea to improve the game. This idea will allow for the following: a constant game where new members can join every month and a competition that never has to end. We're gonna keep everyone involved whether it takes them some failures or not to reach their goals. Tell me whether you like the model of the new rules, and any changes that you would like to suggest.

Just like in Norse mythology, there will be 3 sections to this game. Helheim, Midgard, and Asgard. Midgard is the world in-between, Helheim is the underworld, and Asgard is the home of the gods. Following the traditions of Dante's ""Inferno,"" both Asgard and Helheim will be divided into 9 circles.

The game will be open to recruits on the first &amp; last day of each month. Competitors start in Midgard. If they complete the entire month without watching porn, they ascend to the first level of Asgard. For each failure, the competitor will go one step deeper into Helheim. If you fail while in *any* level of Asgard, you will be pulled all the way down to the first circle of Helheim.

Those who have failed once during any month (read: those who are in the first level of Helheim.) Have a chance to get back to Midgard if they stay clean until the end of the month. If not, they will fall deeper into Helheim, and it would take one month of cleanliness to climb each step of the ladder again.

Those who reach the 9th circle of Asgard will reach Valhalla, the ultimate level.

Obviously, I will not put in place any sort of game until I have assessed whether there is a consensus among you or not. But I think a game like this will both motivate all of us, allow for further recruits, and keep on helping those who fail.

If the game is accepted, I will rename it, keep on counting days each month, separate the members into the categories of where they are in the game, and write a detailed post about the rules - which each continuing post shall link to.

With that being said, let us resume our games:

1347133464.0,16,self.pornfree,zkgzm,Some advice on deleting your collections,19,3,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/pornfree/comments/zkgzm/some_advice_on_deleting_your_collections/,"I've been noticing a lot of people have been working on deleting their collections lately, so I thought I'd drop in and give you some words of advice. (Note I haven't ever had to delete a porn collection, as I've never had a porn collection, but I've done a lot of similar things so I hole it translates.)

**1. You're doing more harm than good.** In fact, that collection isn't doing *any* good. Just imagine how your family would feel if they found out about your collection. How would your girlfriend (for those of you that have them) feel? How would your friends feel? Heck, how would the people in those videos/pictures feel that you're hoarding them?

**2. You're damaging your body.** I understand a good amount of us consider themselves ""forever alone"" - I am too. But say that one day, you break through. Say that one day (and this day may be soon for some people here), a girl tries to turn you on. And you just can't do it. Why? From years of watching that giant porn collection. The more you put yourself on a porn-high, the more it's going to take to reach that high again. (I know from non-porn experience.)

**3. There are other forms of happiness.** There's other ways to be happy besides porn, and clearly porn isn't doing the trick. Imagine how happy you'll feel once you get rid of that collection! I'm betting that it will be a greater joy than when you built up that collection in the first place.

**4. How do you feel after you're done?** How do you *really* feel after watching porn? Odds are, not good. Just by being here, you're admitting that you feel like crap for watching porn. (Okay, not me.) So what's the purpose behind keeping your collection? In poker we have an expression: ""Don't throw good money after bad."" While I doubt you paid too much for that collection, if anything (and if you did, you got gipped big time), the same applies for your emotions. Don't keep feeling like crap.

**5. Be strong.** Ultimately this comes down to strength. By building up your massive collection, you've been weak. Focus on how weak you've become by building up a porn collection. You're giving in to their false temptations. You're allowing the porn companies to win. And you, sir (or madam, if you're in to that sort of thing), are a **weakling**. This part is mostly for men: What's wrong with you? Our gender is meant to be *strong*. Instead, you're letting these women (or men, if you're in to that sort of thing) take over your lives. That's just weak. Weak. Weak.

Hope that helps you. In fact, I hope that makes you feel guilty; that's the point. I can't send you any rewards for deleting porn, that's entirely on you. I hope this gives you the motivation to be a strong, happy individual and delete your collection.

Our brains are hardwired to learn from mistakes and are plastic so nothing is ever permanent. For the first time in months i made it 4 days or maybe 5, not sure how it technically goes with the hours, but I'm extremely impressed with myself and I think when I get back to university and i will not have a door on my room and 3 girls as roommates it will get easier. The girls are all friends and I'm going to have them as accountability partners and I'm actually thinking of starting a group if I can do 90 days noFap or 365 days with no porn at school. I get to a point where I convince myself I'm never gonna be happy if I don't watch porn, and as of now I do not have the strength to do this on my own and it took like 2 years for me to realize i just cannot do this on my own. if the internet were not such a trigger i'd say we should start an accountability system on here but that would be too easy of a slippery slope. I have noticed that porn doesn't thrill me like it used to though. Anyone out there who keeps failing, don't look for motivation, look for inspiration. I used to be all about quotes and all that and say yeah after 30 days I'm cured, or 90 days I'll be cured, but you're gonna suffer this every day for the rest of your life if you let it. External motivation can only get you so far, I mean that differently from help, getting quotes or songs or people to pump you up is only temporary, look into investing TIME in yourself and who YOU are. I can't stress enough after dealing with this for 2 years (but living with it for 10) and being in and out of awful relationships that it doesn't matter how well you do when you're at 100%. When you're down and wanna quit and want to give in and be a coward, THAT is what defines us; the moments we hit rock bottom and have nowhere else to turn except ourselves. In those moments we either give up, or we fight until we fight so hard we're fierce.

It doesn't even seem hard, when you're six months deep of living without ""it"". Seems easy, like I've got this wired, ""fuck that shit"" and maybe that's why relapses happen to begin with. Maybe I let my guard down.

It's not like I'm going to go out and kill a man to get my fix. I'm not that kind of addicted. I'm the opportunistic kind of addicted. Give me a computer, adequate amounts of boredom and sooner or later at NSFW link will be ""accidently"" stumbled upon and clicked and from there it's like opening the flood gates. One little click descends into an hour of the weirdest most taboo stuff I can find. And once that barrage starts, it's like letting a monster out of the cage. God-damned-zilla rampaging every defense I've got. 

It's weird because it's so easy to say no when I'm in the swing of things. In daily life. Doing anything at all, really, I can say no way to any form of that crap with ease, and it really is that easy. Maybe it's the computer itself that's the trigger. I don't know. But just as easily I say no during most of my life, that ten seconds of boredom so easily entraps me in the lure of porn. 

All I needed was K9. If I had to work to find the stuff, fuck it. And when you get a few months into that, your ego gets up and quitting becomes an ego thing, like ""Go ahead, give me access to every porn known to man, throw that shit in my face, I can say no without breaking stride in my convorsation"". I could hop on my parents computer (unprotected) and there was no problem avoiding porn.

Porn is a sneaky bastard.

And then I got a new computer, and that was it, and I knew it was it the day I opened it, I clicked the wrong link at the wrong time and there it was, the Monster was back. And then that stupid idea that looking at porn would get my sex drive back up again and make my girlfriend happy (honestly though, it worked, and it has stayed up, porn or no). And I spent three months living sid by side with porn once again, this time the Monster learned, though. It knows not to suck me dry all at once, it knows to linger and take it's time. Give me porn once a week. Twice a week. No more than that, no hour and a half marathon sessions, just a trickle here and there, and it's working. The damn Monster can feed off me again, fuel my addiction without crowding my life to the point where I notice, it stays in the background, enough to fuel itself but distant enough that I don't notice it is even there among all the other concerns of life, so subtle I don't see it.

Until tonight. I fucking blew it. Vile shit, I found. I knew the guilt trip that was coming but at that point you're beyond hope so fuck it, keep going., Worse and worse. Scrape the bottom of the barrel, then finish and enjoy picking up some shattered, charred remains of the strength and hope I gathered over the last year, try to hold onto the pathetic remains of some joke of self esteem I garnished over the last year.

This is becoming a problem. After a whole gosh darned year, I blew it.

I live a good life. A wonderful, joyous, satisfying life. Except for this, this blemish on everything. I hate it and I hate the part of myself that hangs onto this addiction more than I can bear to admit. I don't want to screw this up. I am a good person, except for this. Can this even be done?

Then, the impulse came back, and I watched porn multiple times, and even downloaded a nude mod for a video game. Pathetic. Now, the love of my life has left me.

I lied to her. She gave me three chances. She lost her trust in me. We tried filtering and monitoring software with my consent. Only a few weeks after she removed it--after giving me her trust back--I became weak and I betrayed her trust. Terrible.

I don't know if she will ever come back. It hurts. It's been over three weeks, but I still cry every night when I think about what I've lost.

But regardless of whether she comes back or not, I need to change. For myself. I gave her a 100% of who I was and still am, but that is not my full potential. For that, I can see why I did not deserve her.

I believe porn is wrong. I want to be able to live out what I believe.

I know I can overcome this.

She may never return, but I will better myself so that I can live with myself. And if she returns, I need to be able to give her my all.

It'll be difficult. I started watching porn in the 4th grade. The constant physical abuse and violence in the home while I was growing up, as well as having been a shut-in did not help either.

But I'm fucking done with the excuses. This will not be me anymore.

I've started working out like I've never worked out before. Physical pain to block out the mental and emotional pain. Physical pain to punish my body until I can transcend myself. I'm not even self-conscious anymore. I'm beyond caring about that silly shit.

I keep wondering if the benefits seen from no-PMO have more to do with abstaining from orgasm than from porn. The reason I wonder is because dopamine and prolactin have a sort of inverse relationship; when one is up, the other is down. After an orgasm, prolactin goes up and dopamine goes down. People with high prolactin levels have libido problems. So I wonder if not masturbating for a while allows prolactin levels to come down to a normal range, thus improving libido.

http://www.reddit.com/r/pornfree/comments/14y143/i_wanna_kinda_quit_but_not_cold_turkey/

It's been a bumpy ride.  As I said previously, I tried quitting cold turkey 5-6 times previously but like a maniac, when I relapse, I waste an inordinate amount of time trying to get everything back and then some.

I first started slowly.  Getting into the mindset that if I watch snips of it and go ""meh"", I can safely toss it.  There was so much, a little in the trash bin wouldn't be missed.  Also tossed my d/l account passwords first thing so no more would get accumulated (Actually reassigned them to a new email account and tossed that so there was no going back).  Some days nothing got kicked.  Others I would purge a 100GB d/ls on a whim.  I probably never viewed 95% of the stuff, past a 30 second snippet anyway.

If I really wanted a specific actress or fetish, I went to a streaming site as it's harder to download and collect for later, so the results of any irresistible urges stayed at that moment in time and didn't drag out to later on my hdd.  They were also slower and more limited in selection.  Frustrating but helps with the push off away from the immediate gratification.

Over the months, I got less and less attached to the stuff.  Started exercising more.  Put my computer in a more public place of my apartment (truecrypt).  Kept myself busy with work or expanding my social life.  

Was down to 500GB last month.  And then one day just felt like ""Yeah, this stuff doesn't mean much to me anymore.""  It's been 3 weeks and no pangs of regret.  No longer a crutch needed.  Of the 12GB I have left, I would say most of it are fanmade pics of an show I'm a fan of, it's not actual fapping material in that sense and just fannish stuff.  Since it's mixed with normal photos from said show, I let sleeping dogs lies and not really look at them.

I think going cold turkey would have been way, way easier.  A few clicks and boom, gone.  From the beginning.  I quit smoking cold Turkey long ago.  But I was ready to quit smoking.  Wasn't quite ready to let the porn go.

1368768742.0,14,self.pornfree,1ei37r,Tips I've learned from my counselor and this subreddit,16,2,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/pornfree/comments/1ei37r/tips_ive_learned_from_my_counselor_and_this/,"Here's a couple things that have helped me (I know I'm only on day three but still haha) and others when I/we want to watch porn:

1) **Go outside.** Take a walk, get some sun, breathe some air, frollick in a field of daisies if that's your thing. Either way, engaging real life is so much more fulfilling than engaging in virtual addiction.

2) **Do something active.** Put all that energy to good use, do some sit ups, push ups, squats, etc. This is a constructive way to not only take out some of that energy and anxiety you get when you want to watch porn but if you keep at it you'll notice that you feel physically healthier, which leads to better mental health.

3) **Smell Ammonia.** Seriously, it's crazy how this works. Sex offenders will often smell ammonia whenever they have an inappropriate urge and it works just as well with porn addiction. It doesn't have to be ammonia (I use molasses) or you can do something other than smell (Maybe taste something bad, or listen to a loud noise, etc.) BUT! do not do anything to physically harm yourself, that's counter productive.

4) **When you relapse, don't hate yourself.** Relapse is going to happen, I wish I could say it wouldn't but it will. When you do relapse do not over indulge (""Oh well I already screwed up, may as well finish masturbating/may as well watch porn all night) because you are rewarding your brain for watching porn. If you do look at porn, get away from it as soon as possible and do not continue watching it. Also, after a relapse do not beat yourself up, thinking that you are useless and stupid. Doing that only turns all your energy against yourself and breaks you down, making it much harder to continue fighting the urges you'll feel. Instead try and understand why you relapsed, and then grow from that knowledge.

5) **Make a visual reminder.** I have a pros and cons list (What do I get from watching porn? Nothing. What do I lose from watching porn? So much) next to my computer with a picture of my girlfriend, a constant reminder when I'm inches from relapse as to why I'm doing this in the first place.

6) **Don't ignore your temptations.** But don't give into them either. Instead, try and understand why you are having these urges and try to imagine your ideal self without porn in your life. Don't dwell on the temptation itself, just try to understand the circumstances which brought that temptation on.

7) **Vocal habits.** When you want to watch porn, get into the habit of saying (out loud) ""I want to watch porn right now, but instead I am going to ______."" This helps you confront your urges rather than just run from them and reinforces your fight against porn.

8) **Purge your porn.** Whatever porn you have saved on your computer, delete it. Whatever accounts you have on porn websites, deactivate them. Whatever porn mags you have laying around your house, shred them. Whatever porn dvds you have hidden away, burn them. Removing easy access to porn makes it much harder for you to slip, because then you have to actively seek much more for porn rather than just falling into your old habits (plus, it feels incredibly liberating to be away from all that temptation).

9) **When all else fails, get away from the source.** If your urge is too strong for you to fight, just switch off your computer. Go to sleep, go somewhere else, just get away from the source. You may have sleepless nights and you may be uncomfortable for a while, but this will pass.

If I say pineapple, *BAM* - pineapples pina colada Hawaii Bert..

My point is that I believe that to really defeat porn, you need to invest in breaking the connections.

And one way is to commemorate your ""divorce"" from porn. Confide in a trusted friend that you are quitting. Write it a lot, *I'm quitting porn TODAY - May 3, 2013*. Then maybe write a letter to yourself, that says clearly on it - ""DO NOT OPEN TIL May 3, 2014. And in it you say, *Today, if I have succeeded - it's been one year of pornfree*

Maybe, Write ""I'm quitting porn"" in 10 languages. Say it too. Shoot fireworks if you're so inclined. This is a *big* deal, all the hundreds of hours we want to save. All the people we want to help.


Get creative. Use whatever ways you can to start off strong.  Maybe you need to use rubber bands on your wrist, or even keep doors open, or install a live camera om your room.

[Break it down using a calendar or paper.](http://i.imgur.com/Jtm9Lxn.jpg) If you are a daily user, strive to quit for 5 hours first. Or whatever it is that is *your challenge*. Then give rewards for streaks. Etc.

Maybe put a sticker on the top of your monitor, that reminds you of your struggle.

Back to the connections. So you need a trusty substitute for the times when you get porn-cravings. Something you can swap in *real-fast.*  Maybe playing chess instead, or sudoko, or even watching Khan Academy vids. I like to juggle. So if I keep small hackey sacks nearby, I can quickly distract myself.


Create an ""Emergency Plan"" - it is OK if we fall, as long as we *get up quickly*!!!

I'm hopeful we can work to quit this habit. Then we find another life, which finds us forgetting porn even existed. We will look back with moist eyes, and smile at our struggle.

I thought I would post this here since I need advice from people who have a similar point of view as myself about porn.

My husband and I are 25 years old and we have 2 children. We got married at 21. While we dated he knew my view on porn.. as I made it clear. I did not want to marry a man who watched porn. I found it disrespectful... I grew up in a house where I was taught it was wrong. I was quite shelterd though.. and in my head I only pictured 50 year old perverts watching porn. I never knew how much of an issue it really was for men or how ""normal"" it was for men to look. So when I told him about how I felt about it... we never went into a deep conversation about it..as I didn't really think it was a problem I had to worry about. 

After we got married I found out he was looking at porn and he hid it. Finally he told the truth. well he started hiding it and lying to me a lot and I pretty much felt like I couldn't trust him at all. One situation that I'm not going to bring up hurt the worst.. and I believe that's when I realized this porn issue was a BIG problem.. and not something that was going to be given up easily. 

He would say he was done, I'd believe him.. then I'd find out it was lies the whole time. It turned into a big routine and I really just got sick of it and bitter toward him. Well after that we started doing a lot better.. he said he was done and I truly believed him this time.. like I felt it was better.. he then got told he was going to be deploying for a year (He's military) Well the whole time he was gone I tried to be supportive.. I sent him letters all the time.. Bible verses I thought would help with the porn issue.. (we are Christian) And idk.. I just really tried to be supportive and we had lots of conversations.. I told him to be honest and let me know and I let him know I'd be there and that lying is worse then not. He promised me he didn't look and he's been fine the whole deployment.

Well, a year goes by and he's back from deployment. Things are going really really well.. because I felt like all the trust issues and bitterness I had toward him went away. 
Well one day I had a feeling he started back up on porn...I was right. I thought he had a slip... so I tried to still stay positive about it even though it did hurt. Well then I started questioning porn during deployment...in the end I finally found out that was all a lie too. And that's when finally I felt like this was a losing battle. All the trust I had just crashed. He never stopped. Even before deployment I was told.. it was all lies.
The lying about it really tends to hurt more then the porn habit itself. 


Anyways now about 2 years later... he's done with porn for good.. says he has been for a lil over a year now. I want to believe him and stay positive. And I try.. but it's hard. I feel like I don't want to get my hopes up. I don't want to be happy and trusting just to crash down again and feel total bitterness toward him. Atleast when I'm in this unsure mode.. it's like he might be.. but he might not and I feel...idk how to really explain it. But I feel safe like this. 

He really doesn't like it though. he wants me to trust him...he says he understands why  don't.. but he wishes I wouldn't question it at all. 

How do I do this and let go and trust? I know porn is an addiction. I know....and even though I know all of this... why do I feel like he's picked porn over me? I used to have very high confidence in my appearance.. as I'm not overweight or anything like that.. I just felt good about that aspect of myself.. (although I did have insecurities in others) But now since the porn issue I find myself always feeling bad about myself. Not the fact that he watched porn.. but the fact that he's had so much trouble to stop.. in my head I think to myself. ""those girls must have something really special that I don't for him to have so much trouble to stop looking at them"" 

And I know... I know it's addiction.. I've read all the things about it. But that's just a feeling I can't seem to shake no matter all of the facts I read about addiction.

Anyways.. how do I get past this ""safe"" zone I'm in.. how can I start to trust him again... knowing there's a chance I will just be let down. I just don't want to go through that again.

I've been living a double life since age 12.

Not only is it a huge drain on my time, energy, and productivity, but I feel like a scumbag for how good I am at hiding it. I am a religious person, and I have a girlfriend who I met at a Christian fellowship I am a Bible study leader in. Me and her have made a pact to wait until we are married to have sex, and as far as she knows, I am a paragon of purity who has never had a problem with porn. I know that if she were ever to go on my computer and see my porn stash in my recent folders, or if I were to accidentally leave a tab of porn open on my phone and she came across it, she would so crushed, it'd change her for life. She looks up to me and trust me so much that I know this is something I just have to do for her. So between that and the fact that I am starting med school in August, I need to cut this stuff out of my life. Therefore, I am deleting my stash, ~600GB of high definition porn including many movies and site rips. Twice before I have amassed a hidden porn stash on my hard drive and deleted it only to fall back in and build it bigger. So I am desperately hoping this will not be the third. While I can be a prideful person, thinking that I can do anything I set my mind to, my failures make it clear that this is something I can't do alone.

I'm new to Reddit, and never made an account until I saw this board. I just want to thank everyone on this subreddit for keeping a community for this topic- one that is incredibly important for me and I suppose alot of people now thanks to the internet. I'm a Christian, and i hope that you other Christians on this board can understand the shame that I feel that this has become a problem for me. 

So that's the introduction done, onto the rest of my post.

I'm not going to reveal my age, but I'll mention that I have lied on the ""are you 18?"" button on sites more than once, and that's a real problem for me, and a lot of other teenagers. It's very easy to expose yourself to porn nowdays, and I believe that it is a problem.

Now you may be saying tl;dr, but I have a message that might help some people - be an example. Youth look up to people, and people look up to you. (In the same way, I guess I'm looking up to you guys now). Porn, for me has had an entrapment effect- It's something that started with a cursory glance, and got worse. It's also something that is hard to talk about. But I've found myself able to take breaks (two and half weeks break isn't much, but it's something.) because I've had rolemodels that are strong Christians and have talked about overcoming the addiction. They also follow God's word in daily life (One actively changes channel when risky stuff comes on, and avoids alcohol on principle).

Obviously rolemodels can only go so far (reason why I'm here), but they are also the reason that I see it as a problem, and believe that I can better myself, and so I ended up here.

I don't want want to make this long post any longer, but one last thing: You can do it. God will not allow sin to overcome you, and he is always there for you. I'm also sure that you can return the favour by helping others. Just show that you live a good life without these bad things and it will rub off on others.

On the other hand if you are quitting for health or to set a good example for others trying to quit you will find that your abstinence from cigarettes will become less variable (and that you have a better chance of not falling back into the habit after hours/days/weeks).

Try to think about how this can apply to yourself as an r/pornfree member.

About ten years ago I discovered porn, and being that I was young and uneducated in what sex was, it blew my mind.

I've since tried to quit repeatedly for one reason or another. But now I have the biggest reason: I'm engaged to the most wonderful woman in the world, and she disapproves of me watching porn or masturbating. She found out I did both when we started dating, and I said I would stop. A few years later, shortly after we got engaged, she got a letter in the mail from our internet provider that we were accused of piracy, and she found out I was downloading porn.

She almost left me, but stayed. I quit for the longest time to date and started seeing a therapist, but one thing led to another and eventually I was looking at porn again and lying to both my fiancee and even my therapist.

I need to quit. Our wedding will be in a little over a year and I don't want her to marry a lie. I need the help and support of people who understand what this is like, and I need to feel like I don't need to impress you which would probably lead to lying.

So I did.

I learned from this. I learned that after it was done, that there was nothing there. There wasn't an urge to even do it. I felt like a robot - or out of body. Sure, I felt what I was doing to myself, but it was as if the part of me that wants change just took a backseat for a few hours.

Like many of you, porn has played a dominant role in my life. Since I saw my first playboy-magazine at age 10, nothing else has been so time-consuming as porn. I loved it, every aspect of it. The novelty, the excitement. the genres...I was hooked. Before high-speed internet, I used every precious dial-up moment looking at naked women and expanding my private collection. High-speed internet made things worse. Make a long story short, the past few years have been one big porn outburst. I collected hundreds of gigs of porn. Collecting became my prime goal, building a collection that would make Heffner jealous. Last week it suddenly struck me. I was wasting all my time on the neverending road of porn. It didn't even excite me the way it used to, I was just clicking, downloading and saving like a mindless zombie. I decided this shit had to end. So I watched the YBOP series and embarked upon my personal 90-day journey that will hopefully lead to a better and healthier lifestyle, a rewired brain, and a renewed excitement for life that porn has destroyed. Though I had my share of girlfirends and still am in a loving relationship I realise porn is not a healthy way of spending my time. 

I have tried pornfree once, but failed miserably. Not this time...My collection is gone, my links to my favorite sites are removed and I have been porn-free for 5 days. The longest i have ever voluntarily been. The urges are there, I find myself going into bookmarks on auto-pilot but there's nothing there anymore and I have enough willpower to not manually type in the url. I know it will get harder as I move along, but I am determined to make it to 90 days (I have to set a goal for myself like this). 

I would like to add that I have no ED whatsoever and am in a sexually healthy relationship. Porn has simply made me feel dull, tired, lazy and sucked a lot of energy right out of me. I also linked masturbating to porn, so it's a no-fap for me as well. I wish everybody out there good luck on their own personal journey  away from obsessive porn consumption.

I'm 26 now. I started off using it to see a glimpse of some breasts, but it slowly got out of control. I started looking at really weird stuff and eventually trans stuff. I've been hooked on it for years due to the fear and rush it causes since I've never considered myself to be gay or bi.

I didn't try to stop until a year or so ago. It's been a constant cycle of cessation followed by relapses involving major binges. Lately, I relapse, binge on porn for many hours, and then start seeking hookups with trans on the Internet. I'm really worried since I feel like I have no control during the binge. I get very little sleep and spend almost every hour of the day on craigslist or other sites. My brain keeps convincing me that I'm just repressing my natural desire and I should keep seeking it out, but it feels completely unnatural more like a drug. I don't think a gay or bi person would get the same sick rush feeling or feel the deep regret afterwards. I also get a rush thinking about doing weird stuff with females that I would normally find disgusting, but not to the same extent as trans.

When I do manage to break the pattern and go weeks without porn or personal ads, I almost forget how bad the binge was. I feel completely back to normal. My interest in women in my daily life returns and I have no attraction to men. Eventually, I'll get a thought about porn or encounters that I can't dismiss and the binge starts over again.

Even when I'm not binging, I struggle with feeling anything beyond sexual attraction. I have sex with many women, but I never feel anything for them. I did fall in love with a girl once, but it faded as I started to think about sex with other girls. When I do stop binging, I always think about her and how good it felt to care about someone and it makes me feel horrible to see the state I'm in
I know this is probably not the best place to post this since it's beyond porn, but I'm trying to break out of this binge and need to get this out. I'm fighting major urges today and internal conflict. The problem seems obvious at times, but then I start thinking about how I should just go through with an encounter and stop 
wiring about it.

However, I don't see it as a major disaster for my recovery. Even watching it I could feel that I was no longer attached to it as I used to be. Going NoFap at the same time really disconnected my physical pleasure from the porn, and porn is my issue - not the occasional fap.



Male 26 here. Recently decided to go cold turkey on porn. I don't have a problem with porn in principle, but it has been the source of some issues for me.

I started when I was about 13, looking at photos online. Nude celebs, softcore, that kind of thing. Turned to hardcore, then to short vid clips, then to full movies once DSL connections became available. At 24 I utterly lost control. Even tho I'm reasonably good looking, slim and in okay shape, I was a virgin, I was depressed, had low self esteem, felt that I couldn't make it with girls. I found comfort in porn.

Luckily I've never spent a great deal of time nor money on porn.. just harddrive space. But after I got together with my first girlfriend I slowly started to realize that porn created problems. I found out that I'm turned on more by the thought of porn than actually having sex. Not the content of the porn, but porn itself. It was an indirect factor in our relatively recent breakup..

I've torn myself away now. I'm on the 12th day with no fapping nor watching porn. I've stumbled upon a couple of animated gifs while surfing reddit, but that's it. My porn stash has been untouched, unopened, unseen.

So far it's hell. I'm having physical withdrawal symptoms. Porn used to be something I turned to whenever I felt bored, whenever I felt my mind drift, whenever I needed to feel good. But I don't want it anymore, I want to be with someone for sexual satisfaction. Sex is just so much more rewarding when I can truly enjoy it (which I've been able to on occasion, but mostly not). So I'm fighting my addiction every step of the way now.

Even writing about it here makes me horny. Shit :P But I'm not giving up.",,False,,t5_2rglh,1340185968.0,,year1,True,t3_v50qx,http://www.reddit.com/r/pornfree/comments/v50qx/12_days_pornfree_now_after_being_a_total_addict/,

Well, I made no proper ones for this saturday and I wanted to share some of it.

As of today, I have been rather lazy, mainly reading and laying on my couch. I intended to go running in the morning but when I woke up I didn't feel like it and instead of getting out of bed, I lingered for two hours. Could at least have gone up, had breakfast and read the newspaper.

The day went on and I felt quite shitty from time to time. I felt lonely and had impulses to watch some porn. What saved me was when I thought that I am feeling lonely because everytime that I am feeling lonely, I watch porn. Watching porn makes me forget about my feeling for a while but then it will come back even harder. Hence I thought that I shall not try to feel less lonely by watching porn. I thought that it is all ok for me to feel lonely and it is more than ok doing so if it means that I will look for some other way of feeling less lonely.

Right now, I should really go to bed. Still, I am lingering in front of my computer and as I have nothing that I actually need to do, I had an impulse to see what is new on some porn sites.

Started /pornfree together with nofap 11 days ago. As I said in /nofap, it was time for a change. 
I wasn't watching porn all days for hours, but you know, there were some times I watched a bit more, than less and so on. And a lot of my porncollection were normal porn but you get easily bored by that after years. So nastier stuff came until 11 days ago I said no. No fapping and no porn no more. At least the a few months and then see if I can watch a porn during sexytimes with my wife or not. But for now it's gone. 

So far I'm doing good. I got rid of my favorites in my browser, cleared all the history and even deleted everything on my phone. The phone thing was pretty hard, cause it was an easy way to fap and watch porn. But I'm not nervous anymore if someone want to look at my phone and would accidentally find my video folder. The same with my computer. You know these famous rage comics about youporn and youtube when you just type in ""you"" ;)
Now all that's left are some gigz on my harddrive that I didn't use for years. Then there is no porn left and yet the urges to look at porn were small. But the risk is great with all the nswf links and all. 
Besides, I don't want to cut out porn but still look at r/boobies for example. So that's the difficult part for me here. Especially on reddit. 

But my journey of pornfree has been to this day successful, I hope I can resist any further urges and I apologize for the small wall of text.

Other habits I've always had, and always taken for granted, have suddenly become clear to me as negative.

The best part is that learning to recognize the porn-addicted voice in my head, and ignoring that voice whenever it shows up, seems to have made it a million times easier to work on changing those other mental habits.  Learning to ignore that voice properly was immensely challenging, and I'm starting to think that going through that process will make future efforts to change negative patterns a million times easier.

1329751272.0,14,self.pornfree,pxu8y,"My story, along with a bit of a ""thank you"" to this subreddit (for helping me stay sane).",15,1,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/pornfree/comments/pxu8y/my_story_along_with_a_bit_of_a_thank_you_to_this/,"Let me begin with my story. I am a female, 19 years old, who was addicted to porn from the ages of 12 to 17. I tried and tried again to kick the habit (or obsession, should I say), but I could never go more than a week. No matter how many filters my parents put on our family computer when I was young, I would find a way around it. I've always been fairly tech-savvy anyways, and it isn't really very hard to do, especially when you're easily pleased, as I was. I became so addicted to porn and fapping that I couldn't go more than 12 hours without fapping. Once that period of time had passed, I would become increasingly anxious and frustrated, to the point of severe mood swings. This would go on for a few days, until I would get over the hump and would feel fantastic about myself. ""It's been four whole days since I looked at porn! This is great!"" Of course, I would usually relapse one or two days later. 

I had been in relationships before, but when I was 17 years old, I started dating the man that I am now engaged to. I distinctly recall that the last time I felt the urge to look at porn was two days after we started going out, and I fought it, and won. I loaded the website of choice up and picked out a video and everything, but I didn't press play. As I sat there, looking at the thumbnail, something occurred to me. For the first time in my life, I was so sexually attracted to someone that I found them *more* attractive than the actors in the videos. I closed out of the site, turned my computer off, and went and found something to distract myself from how odd I was feeling over the situation. That was the last time I ever loaded up a porn site. It's been almost two years since then, and I still haven't felt the urge since. 

Because of the nature of *my* specific story, and the fact that I felt wrong about looking at people I didn't even know when I could be thinking about this gorgeous hunk of a man I was actually *with*, it makes it very difficult to believe that all people who look at porn don't sacrifice something with their partner when they do so. To this day, I strongly believe that, had I watched that video that day, the guilt would have been terrible afterwards. I didn't want anyone else as much as I wanted him, and, when we first discussed porn, two months down the road, I asked if he looked at porn. I made him promise to be honest. He told me that he had been extremely addicted to porn for years, but that it didn't ""feel right"" to look at porn while he was with me. Without knowing my history or why I had stopped, he proceeded to give me the exact same explanation that I would then give *him* for quitting porn. He felt bad about fantasizing over another woman, and he felt like it symbolized wanting another woman more than he wanted me. 

We have never had issues with porn in our relationship now, and while we have been criticized endlessly for our ""no porn rule"" by countless friends and adults we know, nobody can deny that we are one of the happiest couples they know. Almost every mutual friend that we have has, at some point or another, remarked on how happy we are together, and asked what our secret was. We usually chalk it up to chemistry, but I can't help but wonder, after learning more about what porn does to your brain, if it doesn't have a bit more to do with it than we thought.

Now, this leads me to my ""thank you"" to you guys. When I first joined reddit, and saw the general attitude of redditors towards porn, I was absolutely disgusted. I was appalled that so many people thought it was ""crazy"" or ""bitchy"" for a woman to be upset by the idea of her partner looking at porn. Then, I discovered nofap (which is a bit strict for my taste, to each their own, but my fiance and I do still participate in the occasional fapping, with imagination instead of videos or photos), and, in turn, pornfree. It feels so nice to find a group of people who understand what's wrong with a porn addiction, and who are here to support each other. I feel much less alone here, now that I have read some of your stories.

1317187231.0,17,self.pornfree,ktsqa,I am addicted to porn and want to quit.  I am asking for this subreddit's help.  (20/m),18,1,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/pornfree/comments/ktsqa/i_am_addicted_to_porn_and_want_to_quit_i_am/,"This is the first time that I have ever written to other people about my problem.  I've known that I've had a problem for a long time, but haven't been able to do anything about it.  Discovering this subreddit has been very exciting for me as I know that you can help me.  I want to quit, because I know that my life will improve if I do.

When I was about 8 or 9 years old, I came across a porn video on the internet.  I was extremely fascinated by it and will never forget it.  At the time I had no idea was sex or what the people in the video were doing.  This was my first introduction to sex.  I watched the video closely and knew that I was interested, but didn't know why.  

Over the next couple of years my interest grew.  I would occasionally sneak onto the family computer and look up porn.  I didn't masturbate yet, so I would just look at it for hours and hours.  This gave me a very false idea of what sex was.  

Eventually I began masturbating and started doing it while watching porn.  It became a regular habit of mine to watch porn at least once a day while nobody was around.  

The longer that it has been going on for, the more I realize the negative affect that it is having on my life.  But the first time I realize that it was a problem I was only 12 years old.  I remember swearing to never look at it again, but failing soon after.

When I was 13 or 14, my mom caught me masturbating to porn.  It was one of my most humiliating experiences of my life.  I stopped looking at it for a few days, but eventually continued.

I had several girlfriends throughout my teenage years.  None of my earlier relationships were affected by my porn use.  I would always become excited by my girlfriends and had no trouble getting or maintaining an erection.  My most recent relationship, however, certainly was affected by my porn use.  I actually believe that it was one of the main reasons that we broke up.  

Porn had given me a very false sense of what sex and intimacy was like by this point.  I went through a long phase during my two year relationship when I would commonly experience ED.  I always felt extremely anxious in real life sexual situations and would not be able to get or maintain an erection.  This problem passed as I began to get more comfortable with my girlfriend, but I still had a problem reaching orgasm because I had stricken myself with the infamous ""death grip.""  I began finding sex with her less and less exciting and found that i preferred watching porn than having sex with her.  I wanted to want to have sex more than I wanted to watch porn, I just didn't.  I had a need for porn that sex simply didn't satisfy.  Eventually we broke up because we had lost our spark, I believe that my porn use was a major factor in this.  I never told her how much I was watching porn or how it was affecting my life.  

I quit watching porn for about 2 months a couple of years ago.  During that time I was able to enforce in my mind a black and white rule about porn.  I simply wasn't allowed to look at it.  This is what I need to do again, but it is extremely difficult to stay motivated and to remember why I want to quit.  Eventually I started watching it again.  I started noticing the odd NSFW picture and girls wearing bikinis in advertisements on the sides of websites.  One thing led to another and I relapsed.  Since then I've quit countless times for several days, only to completely forget my reasons and continue again a few days later.  

I am now a single 20 year old man who has been addicted to porn for over half of my life.  I am terrified to get into another relationship because of whether or not I will be able to perform sexually.  This is not normal and I didn't used to be this way.  I am always wondering what my life would be like if I hadn't become addicted to porn.  

I want to have a healthy sex life.  I want to be able to deal with stress without turning to porn.  I want to be able to be sincerely intimate with a woman.  I don't want to be afraid of not getting an erection or not being able to orgasm.  I don't want to be afraid of being caught looking at porn.  I don't want to feel pathetic.  

Besides this problem I am a completely normal, healthy, smart and social person.  I am in university and have many friends.  I meet girls all the time but I don't know how to take the step of getting into a relationship anymore, so I just deal with my sex drive with masturbation.  I know that quitting porn and decreasing my frequency of masturbation will make it more likely that I will get a girl and have a good sex life.  

I know that this will be read by understanding people.  Please give me feedback.  Tell me about your issues, and how you got over porn.  Give me motivation.  Link me to helpful AMAs or previous posts.  

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

This has lead me to some thinking about what I feel one week in.

The first is that I don't feel a great sense of victory or accomplishment, I feel this way because when ever I got a porn craving I could just get a fap high and smother it. I'm not really fighting it, I'm just covering it up with something else.

The second is I've found for me at least is porn and fapping are two separate addictions, but two addictions that lead into one another. When I look at porn, I fap. And usually (not this week!) when I fap, I look at porn. 

in regards to this week, fapping long term leads to a greater want for porn. My covering of my porn addiction with fapping won't last forever,   I know it will eventually lead back to porn, I want to avoid that.

Triggers are: being left alone in house in early teens / time alone in hotel rooms when away with work / loneliness. Goal is to be porn free &amp; to ""retrain"" my dick. Hope this will result in improved self-esteem, less creepy interaction with women, and more functional sex life.

******************************************************

I have been reading this subreddit for a few weeks now, and it has kind of blown my mind. Reading people's personal stories combined with the advice and support has been really eye-opening. I am sitting in bed, away from home because of work (which I now recognise is one of my triggers), and PMO has just reared its ugly head again... 

I didn't anticipate writing a post this morning, but one of the things I found myself doing after waking up was looking at porn online. This is after 11 days of conscious ""no PMO"" at home. So the next thing I do is come to r/NoFap, read a few testimonials, and think: maybe I need to write something and share it... start the next stage of the process...

So - Here is my story, and my thoughts on my situation...

I'm in my mid/late thirties, male, and work in a creative industry. My earliest experiences of porn material were: ""found"" porn mag on the school bus, read by everyone, lots of giggles, but also profound stimulation... Looking at lingerie/swimwear sections of mail order catalogues... Finding erotic literature at my Dad's house (that introduced me to some concepts that I'm finding very hard to shake off, as they really touched a live wire in my brain, and made a connection that arouses me unlike anything else)... Buying actual porn magazines for a while.... and then... THE INTERNET. 

Reading some of the stories from younger members, I can't quite get my head around how different their experience of PMO is from an early age. I only got dialup AFTER I left college, and didn't really get broadband until my late twenties! 

So my situation now, and this is pretty much the rut that I have been in for a while: being on my own at home triggers PMO. Just hearing the front door shut as my wife leaves the house triggers a butterfly feeling in my gut, and my brain starts planning a PMO session. I now realise that this has its roots in my youth, growing up with my (divorced/single) mother and older sister. As soon as I had discovered masturbation in my early teens, it was something that I (naturally) wanted to do A LOT. So my home situation left me alone quite frequently, and also afforded me quite a bit of time to set up my increasingly elaborate PMO sessions. The Pavlovian response to hearing the front door close has never really gone away, and since discovering r/nofap, I have started to notice it, and be alert to the spiral of thoughts that it triggers. This helps. It's like a similar technique in mindfulness meditation - let your awareness sink down lower and lower to where the root/origin of the un-useful thought pattern is, and deal with the un-useful thoughts AS they occur in your mind. 

So that's my ""home"" scenario, briefly. Here is my ""away"" scenario (the one that I'm stuck in right now, as I'm writing this):

One of the worst scenarios for me is being away from home, travelling with work. My job can be very intense when I'm on the road, but there can also be some good days off. Great opportunity for sight-seeing, working on other creative projects in the hotel room, shopping for yourself, or for gifts for the family, etc. etc... Right? 
...Right... *sarcasm*

I have lost count of the days that I have lost to extended PMO sessions in a darkened hotel room, curtains drawn for privacy/shame. Once I get into them, they can last for hours, with a lot of edging. Once I have orgasmed, the feelings of shame and disappointment creep up, and I might then start drinking to really *finish off the day in style*. 

In a way, the ""away"" scenario is strongly connected to the ""home"" scenario, because of the ""being left alone"" excitement trigger. But I find the ""away"" scenario much more damaging because there are literally no limits or inhibitions to my PMO. I am sometimes in a hotel room for 2-3 days, and I can spend most of that time in PMO cycles. 

The last long stretch I had away from home, I actually took another work project with me that had a specific deadline, and it meant I had to work on it in my hotel room on days off - time when I would normally be locked in the grip of PMO sessions. This helped.

But here I am again. Away from home, waking up in an unfamiliar room, and reaching for porn. Which brings me to my other reflection on my personal PMO equation - I think another trigger is LONELINESS; I am in a wonderful, supportive, fun, fulfilling and balanced marriage with an amazing, creative, intelligent &amp; beautiful woman. She is literally the woman of my dreams. Sexually we have a great time, and can talk about our needs pretty well. But when I am away from her, I reach for porn.

I think this is how it goes in my head:
Feeling lonely -&gt; need comforting -&gt; physical pleasure is comfort -&gt; masturbation is physical pleasure -&gt; cannot masturbate without porn -&gt; *looks at porn*.

(This also applies to alcohol, but that's for another subreddit!)

Looking at porn as a way to combat loneliness sounded ridiculous to me at first, but when I broke it down in my head, it made sense. The craaaazy thing about this situation is that I have found myself looking at porn, getting into a PMO session, then realising that I've been awake for two hours and haven't called my wife to say good morning. That is fucked up, and shameful. 

So basically that's my situation. (Sorry this is a long post!)

Here's what I want to achieve:

1. To be porn free. 
2. To ""retrain"" my dick not to rely on my hand for that specific sensation. (Dan Savage - @fakedansavage - talks a lot about ""The Death Grip"" that men use for masturbation, which desensitizes the penis to any other touch than their owner's hand; he recommends something similar to NoFap to retrain the penis to appreciate someone else giving you a handjob/blowjob. I have difficulty coming from blowjobs, so I'm hoping to change that through my NoFap journey.)

Here's what I hope the results will be:

1. Higher self-esteem, less feelings of shame/disappointment/hiding.
2. Better interaction with other human beings, especially women.
3. More fulfilling sex life with my wife (blowjobs with endings!).

Thank you for taking the time to read this. 

I think I have realised while writing this that I might need to talk to my wife about some of these issues, as it's not something I have shared with her, due to the feelings of shame etc.

Ok. Got to go now. 

THANK YOU.

p.s. (there's more???) - My own personal opinion is that masturbation is NOT WRONG. It is a healthy expression of sexuality - or at least it should be. But I understand that PMO binds up masturbation with porn &amp; shame, so the best way to solve that problem is to break it down to its constituent parts, remove the power of the equation, and deal with it all separately. In the context of a shared experience with a partner, masturbation / mutual masturbation is, IMHO, completely fine and wonderful. Here's to healthy sex lives with REAL PEOPLE!

-------------------------

However!  This time after the relapse women are still more drawn to me like they were during my streak.  My confidence is still there.  My voice is still stronger and my tone more assertive.  I still have the energy and willpower to get shit done and keep my life going in a positive direction.  Last, but certainly not least, I am NOT down that I relapsed!

Some things are beyond out understanding, yet, I sense this force out there upon all of humanity, distracts us, leads us down wrong path. Everyone can not win, right?

So the fittest survive.

Porn is like some beast we have to outrun. Or band together to hunt.

So it is 2013, and we have formed a tribe hear of sorts. We have a basic rule that we have to acknowledge porn is bad.

We forgive the use of it in each other, so long as none of us say it is good for us or noe of us pushes each other to use it. Or advises on it.

We dont force our views upon others, we dont go into gonewild with anti-porn messages.

People come to us, admit the problem, and we form a tribe to conquer it, to give us the will to overcome it, through collective energy, and thus we set out to conquor the world, or at least as much of it as we can, or grab our fair share...

I recently had some terrible relapses and I am trying to find new ways of preventing another relapse.  I recently read about a technique used by people who are trying to lose weight or quit an addiction.  It sounds cheesy, but I think it will work.  Basically, you take a box and fill it with motivational material (e.g. photos of family, motivational quotes, music, etc.).  That way, when you get an urge to act out, you can open this box and remind yourself of your commitment.  I’m going to fill mine up with:

* Pictures of family and friends (who I don’t want to let down)
* A CD/ list of motivational songs
* Motivational quotes
* A list of activities I could do instead
* A list of goals/things I want to accomplish with NoFap

You can add whatever you want to your box, as long as you think it will help you out.  You may want to make a virtual one (perhaps a word document or a powerpoint) that will include the above plus links to motivational YouTube videos or articles. Whatever you like.

1361619116.0,14,self.pornfree,192r14,(Longish) Intro from Leopardo del Oro,14,0,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/pornfree/comments/192r14/longish_intro_from_leopardo_del_oro/,"Hi Folks -

I am new to this board.  I am also, through this board, new to Reddit.  I am loving what I have been reading here on noporn so far - visiting here and reading posts seems to be a great thing to do when I feel low and have porn-y urges - it gets me feeling all centered and clear.  Thanks to y'all for posting.

I am forty-three years old.  I have been bouncing back and forth in porn addiction and sobriety for most of the twenty years since I had my first orgasm while awake (I was a late bloomer).  I am happy for you youngsters who are nipping this shit in the bud at a younger age.

Sometimes it has seemed to me that porn binges are the most pleasant activity that I've done in my adult life.  Not sure if that's true - I've done lots of different fun and healthy things, often.  Anyway, I've heard it said that there's a saying in AA, which is that sometimes unfortunately we need to give up the most pleasant thing for us in life, so that all of the rest of our life can become more pleasant.

Porn addiction has, at times, had such a strong pull on me that I am, like the first step in the twelve-steps says, apparently absolutely powerless over my actions.  Watching the ""Your Brain On Porn"" has helped me to understand the mechanism of limbic brain hijack.

I have, at times, like many of you, spent days at a time in a narcotic haze inside ""the bubble"", doing nothing else but being on my knees worshiping the jpg/mpg goddesses, blocking out the outside world as best I could, only eating, using the toilet, and sleeping when I absolutely could not put it off any longer.  I've drained my lifeforce so badly at times that it took five or six days to recover and felt human again.  I've rubbed so vigorously and for so long that I've gotten scabs that have taken a month or two to heal, and have made real sex painful.  I've lost relationships (including one girlfriend that was practically a fiancé), lost friendships, pissed off my parents, done poorly at jobs, and lost months of my life (and thereby lost money and resume credibility) when not working.

There have also been times that I have been porn-free, thankfully, and the limbic hijack has abated.  I have been free of porn for years on end at times, often with the help of SAA meetings and/or making commitments to men's teams that I have been on.  Those years have often been some of the most productive, happy, loving, alive, and growth-filled of my adult life.

At this point, it's been 6.5 months since I hit an emotional bottom and did my last fap to porn.  Being porn-fap free has been wonderful - I've had more energy, I've been more productive, and my relationship with my gf has gotten noticeably stronger.  I have been feeling more comfortable around people and more proud of who I am.

One thing that has helped me to stay sober has been being honest with people around me - my girlfriend, my parents, various friends - about my addiction, the impact that it has had, the strength of my urges, and my desire to stay sober.  The largest part of stopping porn-fapping however has been making a commitment to the current men's team that I am on.  I told them that I would email them if I broke my word, and there have been times over the past few months when the urges have been so strong, but I felt like I would be damned if I was going to have to email them and admit breaking down - so my pride kept me sober.  I also have a commitment with them in place to meditate for half an hour immediately before any fapping, with no activities (such as getting on my computer) in between.   This seems to help me to only fap when I am being intentional about it, when it really is the healthy thing to do, and not out of real-life-avoidance or impulse.

I have however looked at and downloaded porn during the last six months.  Well, for weeks at a time, it hasn't interested me.  But, as y'all know, if I have started looking at some, I start to want to look at more, and then I do not seem to have been able to put a stop to those ""look at porn"" limbic highjacks.  I notice that, as always, I have looked at porn not as act or recreation, but mostly to run away - compulsively logging on when I feel like the next thing on my to-do list will be really difficult, or when my work (I am working on starting a business) seems impossible/overwhelming.

I have noticed that a big part of the addiction of me is the collecting and organizing of files.  It's like my brain thinks that gathering up some new flv file, jpg series, or pdf comic, I've accomplished something, like I somehow own one more girl.  This is true, of course, even if, as usual, I never look at the file again.

There are times over the years where I look at porn and have thought, ""Man - this porn is so hot - that's a clear sign that I should get out the lotion and post up.""  After many cycles like that, I've come to believe this: yeah, porn is hot - that's its job.  Yeah, there are a lot of hot females in this world too.  There's a lot of hotness in this world. And, none of it means that I am necessarily supposed to do anything about it.  Usually, what my highest calling seems to do is to take a deep breath, circulate the energy, and go on with what I was going to do before getting all turned on.

There have been times when I have slipped back into the addiction by telling myself that ""all my friends do it"", ""sexual urges is just natural"", ""if I fantasy while masturbating, it's the same thing, might as well look at the real thing"", ""my problem real is just that I am uptight and judgmental about porn"", ""written word stories are OK, they're not really porn"".

Many of my friends have told me how much they enjoy porn, and have, reportedly, no problems with their daily use of it. Many of them have urged me to loosen up and just enjoy it. This used to trip me up, and I think that I used it as a rationalization a few times to go back to using porn when I could/should have known better.

Then I notice that I have friend who are recovering alcoholics, who seemingly can't have a single drink or else they will slip back into life-damaging binges. Conversely, I seem to be fine with drinking - I don't think about alcohol unless someone offers it to me. I can't recollect the last time that I had a drink, and I certainly can't recall the last time drinking affected my life negatively.

So, I don't know if porn is healthy for other people. I don't have any overarching opinion about its place in society. But I know that it clearly doesn't seem right for me.  After trying to ""loosen up"", I have always eventually remembered my reasons for wanting to stay porn free:

* The porn-bubble is not the real world, and I'd rather live in the real world, with real people and real accomplishments.

""Pornography is just 'fast-food feminine energy', it will always leave you wanting more, with little or no nutritional value.  There is nothing ful-filling about pornography, it pales in insignificance to a fully embodied loving woman."" -- Barry Long

* My relationships with women I date as well as with my friends and family seem to feel more clean, intimate, and loving when I am porn free.

* I keep my word more, have more self-discipline, accomplish more, and respect myself more when I am porn-free

* The PMO urge usually seems to happen when I feel stopped, collapsed, blocked, defeated, hopeless, avoidant, or when I feel a surge of energy, possibility, openness, being called to the next level that feels frightening and challenging.  So, the desire to enter the bubble often happens when I dislike how I am feeling in the real world.  I have literally, often, when breaking my word or going against my conscience and starting jacking, I have said to myself ""this is out of hatred for life"" or ""this is choosing not to live"".  I would rather face my challenges head on.

* Again and again, in moments of spiritual stillness, when I let my mind open to ways I could improve or purify or take more seriously my life, it immediately comes to me that either stopping porn/compulsive fapping, or staying stopped, is the number one thing that I can do to improve my life

* I have more physical vitality, alertness, ability to be sharp on little sleep, and openness to happiness and magic when I am PMO-sober


Here are some tools that have helped me to stay sober:

* Talking about the addiction and my desire/commitment to stay sober with any friend who it is appropriate to talk about it with.

* IMO, human willpower is like those mini-rockets that help a space module dock with a space station, not like the big rockets that get the module off the Earth.  So - I try to get out of my own head/will-power loop, and get external help - that's the big rocket.  I've stayed sober more when I have had a commitment/accountability buddy, been on a men's team and made a commitment to them, 
and/or made commitments to therapists coaches or spiritual teachers.

* SAA meetings are great.  I also love online forums like this one, reading and commenting.  Being in a context of people doing their best to stay sober, and talking about it, I think helps to create a paradigm of sobriety, and helps to counteract  the sexuality/porn-iness that seems to pervade the internet. 

* Like I said, having a commitment to meditate immediately before masturbating.

* For years, I kept a document that contained both every reason I could think of why I thought using porn/PMO was OK, and every reason why I thought it was a problem.  Any time I had a new thought, feeling, experience, or piece of information, I would add it to the document, either the pro or con.  Eventually, I could look at all of my various opinions about it, all at once.  And that had me realize that, overall, pro-porn arguments notwithstanding, there are clearly more reasons to quit.

* Finally, years ago I started keeping a log of my most intense binges.  I have written down: 
 - the date(s)
 - how long I spent porn-ing/fap-ing
 - how many orgasms
 - why I think I slipped (ie feeling overwhelmed with work, feeling upset with myself for how late I stayed up, feeling happy and strong and like I could be OK with it this time, etc)
 - how I felt during the binge, anything unusual I noticed during it
 - how I felt after the binge (usually drained dirty and socially withdrawn, but occasionally down to a comfortable level of energy and ready to get work done)
 - what (negative, and, where appropriate, positive) impact the binge had on the rest of life - impact on other people, on my mood, on my productivity, on doing what I intended to do

Every once in a while, looking over my binge log, and all the crazy shit stretching over the years that it describes, and seeing the immense negative impact that porn binges have had on my life, had helped to decrease the ""it's OK just one more time"" denial.

Giving up looking at porn and hot non-nudes has been the hardest part of my journey so far.  I'm really ""good"" at edging if you can call it good and haven't O'd during these 72 days.

Anyway, since I've joined pornfree, I haven't checked out any porn.  I've come across bits here and again, as I've cruised the web for my normal stuff, but haven't lingered and have been disciplined about moving on.  This has been much easier now, than it has been for a long time.  Anyways, I'm 7 days pornfree at the time of this posting and feeling good about it.

I didn't mean to deceive anybody about my PMO streak, I'm just dealing with my addiction in a way that works for me.  I'm looking forward to living more honestly, than the self-deceptive life of using porn.  I don't think I'm better than people who do use porn, but I know I'm a better ""me"" when I don't use it.

I hope this is a step in the right direction though and feel like it is. I've been a frequent user for about 9 years now. Usually fapping 1-3 times a day. It got so bad that I couldn't get out of bed without first spanking the monkey and had binges whenever I was home alone over the weekend.

The first 2 weeks went by fairly quickly. I've kept my focus on noFap and failed so I was telling myself to at least not watch any more porn. I didn't feel the urge to either which seemed strange to me. 
But for the last few days my brain was all like ""you didn't miss porn for 2 weeks. Boy treat yourself to some porn! 'cause you are no addict. you've proven that!"". 
So you can probably understand why I'm all bummed out.

I know it's no ""I've done it and chicks are all over me now!"" story. And it's not supposed to be. I just wanted to not need porn in my life anymore and cut the fapping to a reasonable level. I'm down to 4 times a week.

How have the 2 challenges compared in terms of benefits?

I'm on day 23 of nofap/no porn and have realized the 2 are very different animals.

Longer version, if you care to hear my story...

It all started when I read this guy's blog about his porn free experience.

http://naughtynomad.com/2012/10/19/porn-how-giving-it-up-has-changed-my-life/

From there I discovered the nofap reddit and decided to give it a go.

I'm on day 23 and I've realized no porn and no fap (masturbation) are two very different animals.

First, no porn:

For me, going no porn has been easy. I know there are a lot of guys on here that feel addicted, so don't take this the wrong way, it's just my experience. For me, it's not a matter of depriving myself something I crave it was simply the epiphany that porn isn't good for my brain. 

I don't want my brain's relationship with sex to be one where I see literally hundreds of different naked girls in the span of an hour or one where I can access ANY sexual fantasy, no matter how specific, in a matter of seconds. Wanna see a blond girl, together with an Asian girl with fake boobs, on a beach from a pov camera angle? No problem, just need 30 seconds to find it. 

Once I took a step back and thought about how different that is from a normal, healthy relationship with sex, the rest was easy. 

No Fap:

No masturbation on the other hand has been challenging! I had sex very early on in the challenge but not since, and just the sheer celibacy has me feeling restless. Truth be told, I don't even have any objections to masturbation, I think it's normal and healthy. In fact the only reason I'm doing it is because I found the nofap reddit before I found the pornfree reddit!

That said, I'm at day 23 and will probably continue because... why not? See what it's like and I really doubt I will ever look back and say, ""wow, I wish I masturbated more these last couple months.""

But yeah, curious if anyone has tried both separately and would like to share their experiences. Thanks!",,False,,t5_2rglh,False,,month3,True,t3_12zwad,http://www.reddit.com/r/pornfree/comments/12zwad/porn_free_vs_nofap/,
1352520902.0,13,self.pornfree,12y7os,It's been a while.,15,2,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/pornfree/comments/12y7os/its_been_a_while/,"Hi r/pornfree, I have to say I've been a long-time lurker and it's been nice coming here regularly and reading from like-minded people, but I have never actually contributed to this community, so I thought I'd share my story. It's quite long and mostly personal.

I'm 24 years old and have been watching P online on a regular basis since I was 9. I come from a somewhat troubled family background and I think that it helped me fill a certain void in my life, and helped me to keep some emotional balance. However, that balance, I have come to realize, was a seriously twisted and unhealthy one.

During the first years, I didn't really think much of my habits, I had been doing it for long enough for it to become ""natural"". On top of that, I have found that it is perfectly acceptable, on a society level, for a male teenager to have such habits. As such, I never really got to question myself. Of course, as I'm sure all of you have experienced, the stuff that I needed became dirtier and dirtier, but again I never really thought much of it. Every time I'd raise the bar, I'd have a few moments of ""what am I doing with my life?"", but quickly these thoughts would give way to my cravings, always increasingly more brutal, animal-like. 
Luckily, I had girlfriends most of the time while growing up, and I'm thankful for these (now ex-) girlfriends for helping me (unconsciously for me at the time) keeping a foot (or at least part of one) in the reality.

It is only more recently that my life has changed drastically, and I've been basically traveling and living in foreign places for several years now. Through all of this unstable and fast-changing life, one thing has remained here with me all along - there was always an internet connection somewhere. It has constantly kept me company while my environment, my friends, my jobs, my apartments were always changing. Slowly, I began to realize it. I realized it when I turned crazy during a 1-week vacation with no internet (I would spend hours roaming the streets with my phone, trying to find an unsecured wifi network). I realized it when I noticed that the only time of the day I'd smile was when I came back home after a hard day's work and typed in my favorite address in the browser. Or when I would have to take a break from work because I couldn't wait until the evening. Or when I would turn down an invitation for a date later in the evening because I knew there was a finished torrent waiting for me at home (I actually did that...).

But this is all stuff you've probably experienced, more or less.
For me, the real kick came not suddenly, but gradually. I met a wonderful girl last year. We immediately hit it on, she was exactly my type of girl - I felt great around her and I liked pretty much everything about her. Then came the time when things started getting intimate... It felt great at the beginning of the night. But when shit got real, I just couldn't get my shit together and simply bailed out. That's right, ""sorry I can't do it"" and that was that. I couldn't get myself to do what I had to, I didn't want to, I wanted things quick, effortless, I was completely disconnected from the reality and couldn't feel anything. The woman in question liked me enough to try a few more times to get things going over the next few days, but to no avail, I couldn't be bothered, I didn't give a shit, my best companion was right there on the desk and I wouldn't cheat on him. 

Obviously, things ended right there. Since then, I've been single (give or take a few failed relationships attempts and one-night stands followed by emptiness and sadness) and my habits have worsened. Thinking back about this woman, what she meant to me and what we could have had together if I weren't such a poor excuse for a man (and this thinking has led to alcohol issues, to top it all), I've decided that enough is enough. This is not who I want to be, and I will, I shall change my habits and bend my personality to re-orient it towards a version of myself I can actually like and be proud of. I will dedicate all my strength to it. Currently my strength is not sufficient, so I've joined the gym and been reading a lot about confidence, entrepreneurship, and responsibility. I've also been coming here regularly, after the inevitable initial period of ""I don't need this shit, it's not that bad"", followed by the sad realization that IT IS that bad. 


But rather, I'd like to say, no, it's not that bad. IT WAS that bad. Now, I've been free for 2 days. Here's to the next day, the next week, month, year, fuck it, to a lifetime of healthy human interactions, shameless attitudes, assertiveness, pride and happiness.

I'm a part of the NoFap subreddit too but that is not spot on in my opinion since my goal is not to avoid orgasms at all cost. I will try to keep them to a minimum but when I feel like my lower abdomen is going to burst I want to relieve myself of that ungodly sensation. 

**Quick summary of my situation** I was a cybersex addict for 10 years, so I never had a problem with porn since porn isn't interactive. But chatting about sex with random girls was very addictive to me and I could do that for hours on end. This spring I decided to beat the addiction once and for all, but I've relapsed a few times since then, the main reason being disapointed in something and using cybersex to dull those feelings. 

Now I've been ""clean"" for a month, and I never want to return to cybersex. It's shameful, I always regret doing it after I was done and the things I would cybersex about just got really dark and disturbing towards the end.

As of today I'm giving up porn completely. It's way too much of an addiction for me. One thing leads to another, which leads to another, and even though I went 90 days without it previously, it's still so easy to fall back into the addiction and take the same spiraling descent into my old habits. **Porn is a drug**, there is no going back.

Well now that I haven't look in almost a month or more, the urge to ""reward"" myself is an every day thing. Normally by this time, I would have binged and been back to not needing it for a while. It sucks because it's like torturing yourself for doing so well. 


I would have never said I was addictted to porn until I stopped looking at it. I would have said that my wife wasn't as horny as I was, so I used porn as a stopgap between sex. Well our sex life has stayed the same over the past month (three or four times so far this month), and guess what: I've not been craving sex, I've been craving porn. That was a shitty thing to learn about myself, and I am glad I am off of it. 

My question to Vets, married or long term relationships: So far, my wife and I have been getting along, having sex regularly, but eventually, we will start bickering at each other over something. We've been married for 12 years, its bound to happen. How do you NOT tether your withdrawal to your SO? I don't want the first fight to mean the end of my recovery. I know when she gets pissed at me for something, my stupid brain will say, ""Fuck her, go PMO and feel better"". 

Another thing, I haven't told my wife about my new pornfree and nofap lifestyle. It's a very touchy subject, and I want at least a month or two under my belt (so to speak) before I tell her. She has caught me in the past and it is very embarassing, and i would deny, deny, deny that I had a problem, but she has been forgiving as all hell.

1306096078.0,14,self.pornfree,hhi8a,Let's quit this together!!,20,6,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/pornfree/comments/hhi8a/lets_quit_this_together/,"Hello fellow addicts. Let me start by giving you some of my story. I'm 26 and have been using porn regularly since I was 15. I have never been in a relationship that has lasted longer than a few months. I've only ever attempted to have sex four times in my entire life and each time was a failure. I can't even begin to put into words how this has affected my life.

The first time I tried to have sex with a girl I was 17 and had been masturbating to porn multiple times a day for a few years. The girl was a friend from school. We tried on two different occasions with the same result. I could go for a few minutes but would lose my erection because I was felt very little sensation. My friend was more experienced than I and she reassured me this happened to other guys. Still this really messed with my head. I stopped chasing after girls as I became pretty self conscious and just stuck with what I was good at, watching porn.

I've had many opportunities to have sex over the years without even trying. But when the moment got close I would come up with an excuse to why we shouldn't. The third time, I was 21, I tried to do it with a girl who I knew but not very well. She made all the moves as I would never initiate anything anymore. Same story as before, stayed hard for awhile but lost my erection after a few minutes.

 I thought maybe it was all in my head but I made an appointment to see a specialist anyway. My results were good, no problems with blood flow or anything else. At this point I had lost all my confidence. I barely even talked to girls. I even started to question whether or not I was gay but after considering everything, I knew I was attracted to women. 

A few years later when I was 23 I started dating this girl who asked me out. She was beautiful and smart and I really liked her. A few months in after much stalling and I told her about my struggles (I knew now that porn might be a problem but I never told her about it). She was really understanding and wanted to work through it together. This was a relief but I would soon realize that I was pretty emotionally messed up and would never really let her in. We tried having sex once and it was the same old story. We broke up not too long after. I started to hate myself and completely gave up hope of being with someone.

These last few years have been hard. I know I have a problem but haven't been able to do much about it. A few months ago I went 30 days without watching porn or masturbating. I was happy and so proud of myself. I would get hard just looking at an attractive woman and imagining what we could do together. Life just seemed better, I was more outgoing and social. Then on a lonely night I caved. I regretted it so much and haven't been able to go more than a few day without watching porn since.

I have never told anyone my problems before and when I found this place I just wanted to get it all off my chest. My addiction to porn is effecting my life in every way imaginable. I'm terrified of girls, my social skills are terrible and I'm just not happy. I've read some other posts and realize I am not alone with this problem. I want us to beat this addiction and to help each other by just being their for someone to talk to. I watched porn last night and have never felt worse afterwards. So that's it, I'm done. 

I will be checking in a few times a week to talk about how it is going. I urge others who read this to do the same thing, even if you relapse, let us know and we can help. Let's encourage and remind one another that this isn't healthy. We aren't truly living, experiencing love, and we definitely aren't happy. We can do this!!


UPDATE 1: Day 13 (June 3rd) is almost over and I'm still going strong. The first few days were the hardest but I kept myself pretty busy working outside. In the past I would spend most of my night on the computer until I would eventually find my way to a porn site. Now I have made a rule for myself that my computer is to be turned off for the night around 8:00 (It's already 8:30 now so I will be off as soon as I'm done here). I spend the next few hours before bed reading or watching sports/movies. This has made a huge difference so far. It definitely hasn't been easy but when I do get an urge I would just remind myself how much I want to put this behind me and move on.  Not only have I stopped using porn but I haven't masturbated at all. I found that in the past doing so would just lead me back to porn not too long after. I plan on going a few months without masturbating so I can trust myself to stay away from porn. If I have a few wet dreams so be it and I probably wouldn't mind it happening to be honest. Anyway, I hope everyone is doing well at beating their addiction. Good luck to you all.

I used to watch porn on a daily basis and masturbate with it. I noticed that when getting together with a new girl after some time being single (and watching porn), I would have difficulty getting aroused with her in bed. 

At first I thought that it was simply sexual anxiety and fear of not being able to get it up, but after being with my current girl for a few months, I realize (especially with this girl) that I expect sex with a girl to be like porn. As a result of not being able to get it up, I started getting fearful of ED, and started taking viagra. Here another problem began in that I started becoming dependent on viagra for my confidence in bed. This is terrible since it would increase my anxiety by trying to guess when sex would occur. 

Fast forward a few months, I have kicked porn for the most part since this girl stays with me almost every night. I have seen that I get more aroused with the girl in my bed even if she's not behaving like a porn star. I still take viagra, but I've manage to lower it to a diminutive amount which I guess is less than half a milligram (I split the pills). I'm trying to get rid of that last bit of dependence on the pill, but it's difficult because my mental confidence is dependent on knowing that I have that  backup inside me. 

Anyways, I just felt like talking about it. Every time my girl is away, I get the urge to watch porn (like now). So, I'm trying to really just not look at that stuff since I feel I have done good progress.

On a side note, I notice that if I go a few days without ejaculating, I become incredibly productive and motivated! Maybe this will be a reward by itself (at least until my girl comes back).

I'm addicted to porn.  Absolutely, completely, hopelessly.  I'm 26, and I've been using it since I was spending hours downloading things on my parents' dial-up when I was 13 or so.

That's literally half my life.

It's ruining things.  I'm in a long-distance relationship which results in periods of loneliness (which I invariably fill with porn) but this addiction now seems to ruin the times when we're actually together too.  I feel like I now spend far too much time trawling the internet trying to find new stuff in order to try to attain that original high, which I obviously haven't had for years.  It's not worth it.  The sad thing is, I don't even enjoy it any more, it's more like an itch I have to scratch.

I have tried numerous times to quit - last year I deleted my entire 12-year stash of porn that I'd accrued, but it did no good because I am connected to this here internet thing and can get more at the click of a mouse.  I am beginning to utterly hate myself because I cannot seem to escape it and I feel like I should have better control over myself than this.

How to fight it.,14,1,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/pornfree/comments/1jdyde/porn_depression_procrastination_how_to_fight_it/,"So I originally realised porn was a problem when I started getting wrist pain from it (i'm deadly serious). But since then I've come to realise the problem is much bigger.

I've been doing badly at my studies for 4 years now. If I don't sort myself out NOW I will fail, and have wasted those 4 years. The fun part of my studies died a long time ago, and so I've become quite depressed about it.

Porn addiction is my biggest biggest contributor to my situation. Once I start, I'm fapping/porn-browsing for 2 hours minimum, sometimes up to 7 hours. Its compulsive, my ability to think clearly jumps off a cliff. I've been doing this for over 10 years (i'm 25), the amount of life wasted is phenomenal. Now I'm tired, can't get up in the morning, depressed and still haven't done the work I was meant to be doing. I've come to realise how much porn drains my ability to enjoy anything else. Time just vanishes and I start to hate life.

Having too much work to do is my reason for never socialising. Its why I've never had a girlfriend. Again the loneliness just compounds my need to procrastinate, deepens the depression, intensifies the social anxiety.

I could have an awesome life. I have all the opportunity. But I just keep procrastinating. This MUST stop.

I hope someone reading this relates and feels a little less alone. Reading people's stories here and /r/depression/ really helped me realise that I can sort myself out. People have succeeded from far worse.

I've come to understand procastination+porn is me just trying to push a little happy-lever in my brain. I've had some success sticking notes around my place the that just way 'WHAT'. They remind me to stop wasting and start doing. A good way to tell my bad brain to fuck off when I see a trigger and start to go into an addiction trance. Simply make me realise when I've started wasting.

TLDR: I'm heavily porn addicted, struggling at life, procrastinating everything. Now I have a system of reminders to kick my brain out of negative behaviour.

1375044616.0,12,self.pornfree,1j8fo9,"First step: almost 1TB of porn, shift+del",15,3,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/pornfree/comments/1j8fo9/first_step_almost_1tb_of_porn_shiftdel/,"Hi, I'd like to share my story here if that's okay. It will probably feel good to just get this written down and put somewhere people can read it.

940 gigs of porn. That's the absurd amount I have gathered over the last eight years or so. It's gone now. About half an hour ago I was watching a clip, and I realised it would be my last. I finished watching it and I… ahem, I finished. Then I opened Windows Explorer, calmly checked just how much gigabytes I would free up. Ctrl-A, Shift + Delete. It felt like the right thing to do. I expected to be relieved, and I'm not, but it still feels like I did the right thing.

I'm a 28 year-old gay guy and I have looked at porn since I was twelve. That's when I got internet. Needless to say, it wasn't long before I found my first sex site. That was the beginning of a harmful habit that I didn't see a problem with for sixteen years: gathering porn.

I must have downloaded hundreds of gigabytes in the following years. Naturally, the porn I looked at was a bit different from the porn other boys looked at, so I was very careful not to leave a trace behind. For a long time, I burned everything on cd's, carefully structured and labelled. I had a password-protected database in Microsoft Access to keep track of everything I had and what was where. When I was twenty, I had a big, locked chest full of those cd's and dvd's.

It did not occur to me, ever, that this might be sickly behaviour. After all, it seemed an accepted fact that all boys and men watched porn. It's mainstream, almost viewed as healthy. So I spent hours and even days on this 'healthy' collection. There came a point where I had collected so much porn that it was simply impossible keep track of everything. When I downloaded something, I literally had to look up in my database if I already had it, and at what resolution. Still, the word 'obsession' never crossed my mind. And, I'm ashamed to admit this, but this was eight years ago. Up until recently, I never realised that I might have a problem.

Actually, it started last year. Religion, or rather Buddhism, started to play a bigger role in my life, and I started to question some things in my life. Instinctively, I felt that porn could not be a part of the person I wanted to be. I think the porn industry exploits people and causes an immense amount of suffering. I was also aware that some acts depicted in pornography were degrading and definitely not in line with how I believe human beings should treat each other. Seeing that, I spoke my mind about the subject to a friend. But I was the world's biggest hypocrite: while we had our conversation, a 6TB server was happily torrenting porn at multiple MB's/sec.

Yes, a 6TB server. It's not just serving porn, by the way, but I do have a 2TB drive reserved for porn exclusively. Also, I had a special, secure configuration of XBMC (media centre software) with manually maintained meta information on every single movie I had. I shudder to think about all the time I wasted on it.

Then, I started realizing that porn didn't just cause suffering to people in the industry. At some point, I panicked because I saw I probably had an addiction, or at least some kind of problem. Even IF looking at porn was an innocent habit, the way I did it was definitely NOT. Some googling led me to Gary Wilson's famous TED-talk and NoFap, and things started clicking together.

I have wasted an incredible amount of time on something that is not beneficial in any way and even harmful to others and myself. In fact, it might explain some other real-life problems. For one, I can hardly masturbate without porn. But also: I date quite a bit, but seldomly feel any 'real' physical attraction towards a guy, so I end up rejecting guys quite often. Even after three dates with a great guy, knowing that he's *actually* quite attractive… somehow it's rarely good enough for me. I don't know, this might be some other issue… but I wouldn't be surprised if there's a deep link with porn here.

So I deleted my porn, my special bookmarks, all of it. I have to stop doing this! It will be incredibly tough, because part of me is already starting to regret it. I'm not yet sure about 'true' nofap (still digging into the threads over there), but I have to beat this weird and disgusting habit.

If you had asked me like 65 days earlier if I was thinking of stopping watching porn, I would have told you no way. But 60 days ago, I finished my last PMO session, and feeling like crap, decided to check out YBOP. Well, seeing the effects of long-term usage (I'm 19 and had been watching porn for 5 years) and the benefits of quitting, I decided to try it. The first two weeks were so hard for me. But, I was also fapping. I started my nofap journey 46 days ago without a slip-up yet. The weirdest thing is that it's no longer difficult for me. I get the weakest urges that I simply say no to and they go away without a fight. I feel like my brain has completely disconnected from anything sexual. It has been this way the whole time since I started nofap and I hope it's just my brain's way of rewiring back to a normal sexuality. I don't want to feel like this the rest of my life.

Things I've noticed about myself since starting pornfree/nofap. I am able to keep eye-contact with other people much more easily and for longer periods of time. No more shame! I am more in tune with what other people are thinking/feeling. I am more considerate of others and I enjoy talking with people much more than I used to. I have been working two jobs this summer so I don't have time for many social activities. I hope to be able to do more when I go back to school in the fall. The hard part for me is finding places outside of my group of friends to be social. I go to a large school that has a reputation for being a party school and I myself have made the life decision not to drink ever. I already know that I have an addictive personality, so why even take a chance with alcohol? So, that cuts down on my options a lot. Regardless, I will join more clubs and try to interact with more people this year.

I was doing a little better because I finally had the good idea to make my password to K9 a randomly generated 10 digit combination of numbers and letters, and then write that password down and store it in the back of my desk at work.  Thus, there is no way I can get through K9 at home without driving to work, getting the password, driving home, etc.  (porn at work is thankfully impossible...way too much activity around my office).

Then saturday I found a site that wasn't blocked.  Not hardcore porn, but nudity...and I masturbated with it.  Felt lousy afterwards and went to bed.

The bigger problem is that lately, I can't seem to muster any sexual energy and or interest for my beautiful wife.  Yet, when she left to go running Saturday  evening I had NO problem rubbing one off.  I haven't had sex with my wife in over two weeks and I know she is starting to feel rejected.  I can feel it in her body language when we are in bed....yet the thought of sex just seems so damn difficult like it's not even worth the effort!  Am I so conditioned to PMO that I search for unblocked websites just to get off, yet I won't have REAL SEX with an actual women who really loves and cares for me?  What the hell!

I'm pretty upset about these feelings and I don't know what to do.  I feel like I have to turn off my sex drive to beat my porn addiction, but that will cripple my marriage!

I've been visiting pornfree for a few weeks now and am impressed by the community here. I relapsed again this morning and upon checking this thread I saw that it is the summer solstice tomorrow, at least in Europe. You'll need to check for you own time.

But essentially I want to be better. I'm 22 and have lost far too much of my life to porn. This Toshiba laptop I've owned since 2009 has stolen far too much of my life and my sexuality. Although it's easy to feel bad about time wasted, it would feel great to know that from this point on I don't waste any more time with porn.

Although there are lots of arguments over whether porn use is bad or not, all we can know is how it affects us individually. I know fr me personally, when I look at porn or naked photos or whatever I will fall into a black hole. It's never the 'quick stress release' that some people talk of. It makes me reject the outside world and spend normally a couple of hours on average trying to find the perfect image, and then leaves me feeling depressed, delaying plans and not wanting to talk to people and make up an excuse as to what I've been doing for the last few hours. I don't want to do that anymore.

So I'm putting this on /pornfree and will keep everyone updated. The internet is a major part in our problems, but groups like this are part of the solution so thank you.

1370276582.0,14,self.pornfree,1fl6u9,"What are the 'impossible"" Holds and Grapples that keep us from remaining pornfree?",19,5,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/pornfree/comments/1fl6u9/what_are_the_impossible_holds_and_grapples_that/,"In the movie, ""red belt"" the main character teaches martial arts students that you can ALWAYS improve your position, so know and make your strongest moves.  He demonstrates how to reverse an otherwise impossible to break choke hold using multidimensional thinking.  This requires practice and conditioning to accomplish - but it can be done.

In our case, there are a variety of walls that seem unscalable.  I suggest we document and defeat them.

Here's one such barrier I run into over and over:
I notice I get locked into the craving for release, so my senses pull into a very limited range of awareness, specialized beyond the raw accuracy of a CoD ""hacker."" There's a sort of sweet spot that I'm looking to itch on my body-mind.  Everything gets tight and focused on this task, my eyes, neck, my hands and wrists, my belly, my breathing, my back, my shoulders, it all changes. And there's a sweet spot that I'm trying to move everything through and towards before I feel like disengaging.  Moreover I don't usually want to disengage but rather rinse and repeat until I blow out my receptors.  I have to get exhausted, upset and irritated enough to stop.  

WALL- I am in the cycle.
MOVE-  Get away from the source of filth - shut the computer off.  WALL- I don't, my focus is on the end result.
MOVE- Wait until I complete, and then try to disengage?
WALL- I don't. I look at something else for awhile until my senses, stimulus/response, trigger engaging the porn again so that I can get another release.
MOVE- Wait until I am exhausted.  Possibly until I have burned out my receptors for the time being.  
WALL- Fall asleep exhausted, wake up exhausted which is a trigger. . . repeat cycle.. . . 

What is my strongest counter-move to improve the situation? In order to  make my first strongest move to have escaped the computer and my mad craving, what would I have had to do and what was keeping me from doing it?  I want to know what hold you guys get into time and again, and what hacks have you found that work?

My hypothesis is that I can break out of a cycle that is in action by noticing the cue that is priming the stimulus/response, and then shifting my attention to a different part of the behavior.  Almost anything will do.  I know that the quality of the ""complete state"" of release requires me to really constrict breathing for me (note, not talking about asphyxiation, just very shallow breath), I'm not aware of the breath while I am acting out. My attention is on the result: the pleasant buzz that is increasing or decreasing relative to this form of breath (as well as the speed and intensity of other mechanics of this operation).  So to break this hypnosis, I shift my focus from the pleasure produced onto the process breath.  It almost feels like flipping from first person to third person narrative, it's the same story but you're seeing things differently.  Since the story has always played out the same in the past, now you can recondition what certain sensations (from this perspective) mean, and practice a different response (what makes sense in third person is different than from the limits of first person). For example, I could bring attention to my fingertips on the keyboard, changes in breath, or tension in my face for alternate cues.

1369648047.0,12,self.pornfree,1f4pbj,4th attempt: My experience so far...,13,1,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/pornfree/comments/1f4pbj/4th_attempt_my_experience_so_far/,"Hi all,

So after a difficult few days where I threw everything out and edged like a demon to porn until I couldn't take it no more (perhaps because I knew it might be my last time ever), I woke up to feeling tired, I physically ache all over, I'm disappointed, but extremely eager to begin my 4th attempt.

I wanted to journal my experiences so far, so I thought I'd post here so some of you can share in what I've learned and maybe it will help someone else. Then at least my failed attempts aren't entirely wasted. Even as I write that, I know that I've learned so much for myself from my failures. I mustn't forget that.

Some thoughts:

- Avoid deliberate gazing at sexual imagery for sexual thrill. It is a fantasty. It isn't real. I want to live in reality. Reality is the future. Fantasy is the past.

- Refrain from any masturbation.

- My sexual urges build and build without masturbation, and eventually, after about 10 days, become part of how I feel constantly. I MUST MUST MUST release this tension by masturbation. There is no way around this. From my experience, the longer I hold onto that sexual tension, the more it becomes a distraction, and the more I start to enjoy it, and ultimately it becomes an overwhelming force that I cannot escape. I must learn to accept masturbation as a personal choice, and a necessary action for myself to avoid sex becoming a dominating thought/feeling/force in my life. I appreciate that for some people this may not be an option, those who are attempting 'no-fap' for example. But my goal is not 'no-fap' it is 'no-porn', or at least, a mixture of 'no-fap' until it becomes absolutely necessary, then masturbation is in the name of 'no-porn'. I hope that's understood.

- Maintain personal fitness. This is a good replacement indulgence. Visit the gym as often as possible, work out. Look and feel awesome!

- I must remain focused on the idea that porn is a fantasy. I have had enough of this. My goal is to meet a girl to have a relationship with, to enjoy sex in a healthy way, between us, for each other. Porn will kill that future. With porn, there is no future.

- Lastly, this sub-reddit has become one of the best things I've ever come across. Here I am able to be accountable (day count), I can express how I feel, I can offer support, and when I'm feeling vunerable, I have a bunch of amazing guys who are willing to support me too. And helping others on here has helped focus my own efforts.

My new target is 20 days, beating my previous best of 15. I have already failed at this, and after writing this post I'm feeling optimistic.",,False,,t5_2rglh,1369649184.0,,month2,True,t3_1f4pbj,http://www.reddit.com/r/pornfree/comments/1f4pbj/4th_attempt_my_experience_so_far/,

After I was done I felt like utter crap, but this morning I'm not beating myself up, I'm just disappointed that I didn't reach the two week marker.

Still, 12 days is the longest I've ever gone without porn (the previous record being 7 days roughly 3 or 4 years ago). I'm not mad that I didn't make it to day 13, I'm just excited that I was able to make it to day 12. Now I'm back to day 1, and I keep reminding myself ""You have to make it through day 1 to get to day 2."" Tomorrow I'll remind myself ""You have to make it through day 2 to get to day 3.""

I am excited; I'm not sure why though, maybe because my relapse didn't break me down and pull me back into that pit of denial and anger, but instead I'm now more motivated to keep going than I ever have been before. This stretch is going to be a long one, hell who knows, maybe that was my last relapse ever (probably not, but I'm aiming for that goal).

I am combining NoFap with Pornfree and it's going to be difficult as balls, but when I come through the other side feeling so much better than I did when I was a slave to my addiction I'll know it has all been worth it.

Stay strong, brothers and sisters!

I'm proud i have this self-control.  I'm on-off regarding No Fapping, it's more on how long i can go until i masturbate than trying to get rid of the bad stuff inside me.  But i think i have said it before, i'm masturbating like once a week after a long work's week and not the daily fap fests with or without porno like what i did last year.  I wanted to know what i will feel if i don't orgasm by physically stimulating myself for as long as i'm not visually stimulating myself.  But i'm damn sure i'm feeling a lot better not consuming porno!

I wonder if i never started masturbating to porno a decade ago?  I would have masturbated because it felt awesome and didn't associate it with extreme acts of intercourse and novelty.  Maybe because i never had sexual experiences, not even a kiss in my life so i keep playing and imagining what it's like to do it by you guessed it, porno.

I'm tired of addictions, i want to do something more meaningful to others and a lot more fun activities for me, not staring at the screen for hours. I wanted to have a real person to talk to, a elder to guide me to the right stuff, a group that goes on places with me and *won't harm me*, A Girl that i can be comfortable with and won't judge me on how i look &amp; act, a girl i can Hug and Kiss and Make Love and be with me until my time is up.  And in search of that one to be with for life, have multiple opportunities to be with Girls to be friends more intimately and have real fun!  Opportunities for me alone to travel or do something awesome.  Why am i handicapped in regards to my surroundings?  and money!  It's again the money!

(Report),14,3,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/pornfree/comments/17qqhz/40_days_and_40_nights_report/,"Man, looking back on what my thinking was like just 40 days ago, you really see what an effect porn (and, I'd say to a lesser extent, fapping) has on you. Some things I've noticed:

* **A more accurate view of women** - of course, I know intellectually that women are just like me internally, with vast mindscapes and rich histories. But when you're regularly exposed to porn, there's some part of you that doesn't consider that. Some part that sees them as something...less. Like some gift you deserve to have because its there. Luckily though, that's rapidly fading! Now, in part, I can view them more like I would a sister.

* **A more accurate view of men** - on the flip side of the above, some part of you sees other men as nothing more than competition to be jealous of, seek to sabotage, to outcompete. But now that's all but gone, that odd animal sort of paranoia. I can see them more like I would a brother.

* **A more accurate view of sex** - To be honest, I used to think of sex essentially as the end-all, be-all of existence. What was my primary goal in life? Sex. Many things were just sacrifices on that altar, means to get that end. Kinda like in that episode of Metalocalypse where they're talking about how getting someone to suck their salami was pretty much their whole reason for making their music

Now, looking back, my old thoughts about it seem pretty silly. Existence isn't some road leading to sex. If the right person comes along and that happens along the way, that's wonderful. But, its a spice, not the main dish

Thanks to my newly unclouded mind, I had one of the best weekends of my entire life last week! Let's hope for a repeat!

Ponder the path of your feet, and let all your ways be established. Turn not to the right hand nor the left: remove your feet from evil.*

Brothers, sisters, Solomon really breaks down our addictions here. First off, the eyes. Our eyes, naturally, are the most common form of entrance for this sort of addiction. Yes, there's audio, but most of us either end up at porn or worse by looking at things first. Those pictures, some of them rather tame at first, end up spiraling downward faster than we can imagine. Even now, as we struggle to free ourselves from the chains of this addiction, have to take extra care with what we see lest we end up right back where we started from. My counselor suggests ""bouncing the eyes"" - if your eyes fall on something immoral or a possible trigger, bounce them right to something else, even if it means standing up and walking out. Keep your eyes forward. Stop looking at things that aren't forward. 

Next, he mentions feet. Anyone who enjoys running or walking knows that without a path, you have no idea where you're going. Those who use treadmills or walking paths know that to step off that treadmill while it's running, or to just wander off that walking path usually leads to disastrous results. The same applies to our addiction - if we don't stick to the path, stick to the plan, we end up with disastrous results, and God doesn't want that for us. Don't turn to the right hand or the left - don't let images or possible triggers cause you to look away and step off the path. 

Lastly, the fourth chapter of Proverbs ends with five important words: remove your feet from evil. To push it a bit further, run from the very **implication** of evil. If a bikini-clad picture is too much for you, don't even find yourself in that situation, brothers and sisters! Run from it! If it pops up in an innocuous situation, close the window! Find another website! GET OUT AND GET OFF THE PC. 

God wants us to be free, and in His Son, we are free indeed. If you don't know Jesus Christ as your personal Lord and Savior, please PM me. If you have questions, PM me.

My background wasn't the easiest: single, lonely, skinny guy with a shitty stressful job an low self esteem, I can't imagine a worse scenario for developing an heavy porn addiction. But I held up. Things are not great yet, but improved a lot, I'm more social, more disciplined, more motivated, I'm working out and developing some post-work projects to try to improve my professional situation. Some guys report that after some time clean they achieved some goals (aka pornfree superpowers), that's not my case yet, but I fell I've opened the path and I'm willing to follow it.

For everyone trying to fight this addiction:

It's not easy, it takes time for you to see some improvements and urges will come and go but they will get weaker every week. So keep up. Remember that every day of failure is a wasted day that you will NEVER GET BACK. Time doesn't stop or go back, so don't waste it.

I just relapsed a few minutes ago and now as I watch a re-run of the 2010 fifa world cup finals to ease my mind I feel the urge to watch more and let go my load.

I hope everyone is having an invigorating start to their week, getting work done, and forgetting completely about porn. 'CAUSE I SHURE AS HELL AM!

I wanted to tell you guys a few things about my posting here. First of all, I keep on getting spam filtered, so if you don't see my latest post for the day, the easiest way to access it would be for you to click on my username and see what I've been up to - the most recent post should be right near top of my page. Also, once you find my new post, try giving it an upvote. I cant stress how important they are to getting our posts seen. I don't get any karma, but it makes it convenient for everyone.

So those are just a few pointers, but now, witness how enormous our group has become! I know everyone here is not just an accumulation of nonsensical word fragments, but an individual human being with extremely complex and sometimes irrational minds, just like me. Through our struggle, we have not only made the highly important decision to quit, but are constantly learning about our own brains and how they operate every day.

So even though porn has ruined our lives, it is not stupid to look and learn about what it has taught us: How vulnerable our brains can be, what we live for, why we run away from problems, why it is important to be brave, why control is crucial in life etc. etc... 

Because we're not running away from this to forget our journeys. No, we will turn our addiction on itself and keep the lessons it has taught us - so we can remain stronger for the rest of our lives, no matter what problems come next.

With that being said, let us resume our games:

I felt quickly that I wanted to get involved in this and leave the porn and fap behind.  When I go to sleep in awhile here I will mark the calender on my wall with another X and I will have 5 days without porn or fap under my belt.  Get it, under my belt..?
For me the most important thing is noporn.  i can look back over a long period of time ( wont say how long) and see that i didnt try to meet women (are there women here?!) because I knew I could have porn.  It decreases your motivation to chase women.  And we all want to fall asleep with a woman in our arms!  Or lets just say someone to love.  
Since I havent fapped in almost 5 days I have noticed a change.  More assertive.  No shame in my heart; i feel better about myself because i haven't seen some stupid young girl jizzed up by a horde of grinning swine.  Horny is good.  I feel I have a chance with women, in my case it's not near-hopeless, so I can tolerate it.  I'll just say if you'er a guy and you want to meet women, go to a yoga class.  then fake a hamstring pull; you'll get mobbed by hot women in sports tops and skintights, haha!  Seriously, this is a good place.

but when he masturbates to porn to me it feels like he's cheating
especially since he never really initiates sex, so I have to show an interest first - makes me feel like he'd rather just watch porn and masturbate. 
We've talked about this once, I asked him to stop and he said he did. But (and I know I should never have done this) I looked on his history and there it was - all the nasty nasty porn (like mostly anal stuff and weird things that aren't normal acts of sex for most people). I confronted him and he said he just watches it out of interest mostly. I got really upset and he again promised to stop. He seemed to take it more seriously when I explained to him that it hurt me how he was masturbating to other women, and that how would he feel if I were at home masturbating to naked hot men. 
I don't think he still watches it because it seemed to come to reality when I turned it around asking him how he'd feel if I were doing it, but I can't shake the feeling that a) either he's still watching it secretly and/or b) that he's got something wrong with him because of the nature of the porn he [used to] watch
Can any one advise/relate? 
 Edit: Also I am clearly having a hard time coming to terms with this, I am slowly gaining more trust that he isn't watching it, but it's still a struggle to believe him. Any advice on how I could start to get over this?, assuming he has in fact stopped watching it

I had a good deal of success as far as improvements to my life, but it was also driving me up the wall.  I gave in last saturday night and MO'd with no porn, and not even any fantasizing (it wasn't even necessary, I was so ready to go).  

Since I made the decision to make this change in my life (pornfree), it has not been all that difficult to not go to the porn sites.  I've had temptation issues with things I've accidentally stumbled on, but I've been good about clicking off them right away.  I also installed K9 from the start and that has helped immeasurably.  

I did feel some of the brainfog come back on Sunday morning, but that has cleared up mostly again within the last couple days and I don't feel like I am starting over by any means.  I did delete my badge over there at nofap, but I've been pornfree the whole time, so I'm not resetting that one.  At the moment, my plan is to only fap (with no porn) when it's absolutely necessary.  Maybe every couple weeks or so, depending on how I feel.  I didn't feel any chaser effects from Saturday night and I've had no increased desire to look for porn again (I've been a consumer of it for 28 of my 36 years).  

Not sure where this will all take me, but it can't be anywhere worse than where I was.  The biggest difference I feel right now is the brainfog clearing up.  It makes my work easier and my life more pleasurable.  Hope to have more positive updates later.

This morning I was describing to my wife what this recovery is like and I came upon a good metaphor for how this has been working for me.

I picture my porn addiction was like an iceberg, and the part above the water looked like this:  ""Hey, I'm just a guy with an above-average sex drive, and when my wife is too tired to have sex, I masturbate to porn and go to sleep.  I'm just like any other guy.""

But the part below the water, which revealed itself more and more as I stopped bullshitting myself looked like this:  ""I'm a guy who is so fixated on sex, either overtly or under the surface, that I cannot get enjoyment out of everyday activities because they all pale in comparison to porn.  When I'm working, I take frequent breaks to look at facebook, but I'm actually just looking for someone attractive to look at and get a micro ""fix.""  I look at a website with graphic design pictures because intermingled were pictures of naked women.  I pretend I'm interested in the artistry of what I'm looking at.  I convince myself that I'm into photography and that I would be a very artistic erotic photographer.  I wonder if my wife would let me do that.  I could quit my job and photograph naked girls for a living.  When I'm driving down the street and I see an attractive girl walking on the sidewalk I slow down so I can stare at her the entire time I cruise by.  When an attractive girl crosses the street in front of my car at a stop light I take in every detail of her body and fixate on it for every second I can.  I see the experience as a precious gift, I feel for a moment like I'm immersed in love, like I just had a whole relationship in my mind with the person.  I'll use all of these experiences later when looking at porn.  I'll try to find people in movies and pictures that look like my momentary fixations of the day.  And all of this is completely empty, lonely, and only exists within my own mind.""

The addiction is also like a tree, the trunk of which is the most obvious symptom, looking at pornography.  But these branches come out, things that might not seem like porn but I'm using them for the same purpose, and the branches get so thin at the ends that you can barely see them, but they lead back to the trunk, the root of everything wrong.  

I feel like a lot of us who are fighting our porn addictions are looking only at the trunk of this tree and trying to hack at it with a hatchet.  For some of us the trunk is thick, and the roots go deep, and it seems helpless to attack something so seemingly permanent with the meager tools we've been given.  

But here's what has helped me so far...

Attack the branches.  Find them.  Follow the limbs out until they almost disappear.  The things that lead back to the trunk in ways you don't even want to admit to yourself.  If you begin to destroy those branches and limbs, the trunk will weaken.  The addiction draws strength from these seemingly small things that collect droplets of lust and fantasy until later you're sitting at your computer wondering how you got there, worn down, weakened.  

Attack the branches and the tree will die.",,False,,t5_2rglh,False,,month2,True,t3_zv6xk,http://www.reddit.com/r/pornfree/comments/zv6xk/kill_the_tree_branches_first/,

When I first made the decision (after watching the great porn experiment video) to stop using porn and masturbating, I actually felt elated.  I was on a self-improvement high and I felt like I was going to drastically improve my life, get rid of depression and anxiety issues, and be a better husband to my wife.  I read the book ""Breaking the Cycle"" and it shed more light on the sexual addiction spectrum.  I realized that even though I would masturbate at the end of the day, I was prepping myself for that late night session all day long by sneaking peeks at stimulating material throughout the day, and sexualizing any moderately attractive woman I saw out in the world.  I was wasting so much mental energy on that pursuit, and putting everything else on a lower priority in my mind, and I hadn't realized it.

So it feels like the last couple days have been harder than usual.  The ""honeymoon"" phase is starting to wear off and the feelings of self-empowerment are fading.  I know that I'm not going to break down and I'm not going to falter, but I can feel that pull.  I constantly have to remind myself why I'm doing this, and why it hurts me.  I feel like I keep seeing hot girls appear in front of me out in public and my old porn mind says ""YES!  You can look at her, she's like a precious baby deer that just leapt out of the bushes, savor her rare beauty!"" but I have to force myself not to stare, look away, and I actually think ""damnit, why do I have to deal with this right now.""  I feel angry.

But one other thing I noticed is that I must have more testosterone in my system, which can be good and bad.  I kind of flipped out on my wife over something last night, and probably spoke a little too strongly, but I stood up for myself and something I didn't think was right.  Afterward I thought to myself, ""I'm actually growing a pair.""  I'm not taking the passive stance of someone who only cares about busting their nut later, I'm standing up for myself and my self worth, which is increasing as I realize the control I'm gaining over myself.  

So next time you feel like you're ""backed up"" or ""about to explode"" just know that it's the sensation of growing a pair, and being a real man, of self control and self respect.",,False,,t5_2rglh,False,,month2,True,t3_zgu0h,http://www.reddit.com/r/pornfree/comments/zgu0h/growing_a_pair/,

Background: Mid twenties male, porn since puberty, quit last year for the first time as I was coming out of a bout of deep depression. Have been touch and go since, but generally relapse if I'm a) drunk home and alone or b) extremely stressed. Have urge to relapse now cuz I feel like shit, but decided to come here instead.

I was porn free for about 2 weeks before I relapsed this time. This past year I watched porn maybe once a month, always feeling weird after but not to this extent. Previous to that I could burn hours watching it. The longest I've been porn free is ~60 days. However, whenever I leave my apt, I have zero desire to watch porn or masturbate. So if I travel for long periods of time, I generally am fine. It's just when I'm home. Also - yes I'm pissed at where I am in life and trying like fuck to find my way out of it. Sick of my job, where I am, everything. Girlfriend is the best relationship I've ever had in my life, but I'm not sure if she's fully the one.

This spiraled out of control.  I had a destructive mix of porn and Paxil in my life (Paxil can make it near impossible to ejaculate and it made nocturnal ejaculation impossible) So I wasn't getting off by masturbating to nothing and it wasn't happening when I slept, basically I had blue balls all the time and porn was that ""necessary"" evil that kept me from going insane.  I'm sure my family knew what I was doing whenever I put weights by my door and rubbed one out next to the computer.  Being raised in a Christian house, I felt condemned and guilty after each view.  I tried to stop (I even had accountability partners and family members that would view my history).  The shame didn't matter when I wanted to look.  I would get so ""up"" that I would start shaking in excitement and anticipation.  

To the married part, my wife googled my username when we got engaged and found my confessions on a christian forum.  She confronted me and I broke down in tears.  I hated myself.  She said she still loved me and that we would work through this. 

We got married and I hate to say, but I never was able to cum from intercourse.  To this day (over 4 years later) I can count on one hand (no pun intended) the amount of times intercourse has brought me to orgasm, even BJs have rarely worked.  I have never had ""good"" sex and the only time I orgasm is when I think of porn while jerking off next to her.  It is humiliating to admit.  But I do want to share some of the real life consequences porn can have.

I hit rock bottom when I told my wife that I would not look at porn when she was away at work, and I looked anyway.  I won't forget the feel of that gun in my hand and placing that bullet in the chamber.  I decided to not shoot ultimately (duh?) but I knew my life had changed.  I hated myself for my addiction and I knew it had totally taken control.  

My wife told me how much she loves me and how she would always support me.  She told me how she would never leave me so long as kept up the fight.  She also told me to not hate myself and that I should keep my focus on the days I was tempted, but didn't look at porn.  

Anyway, there is a ton more to my story, but long story short: Keep fighting, and stop hating yourself.  That misery will only make porn that much more appealing (short term pleasure to get rid of the pain).

But you just had to have that burger, you just had to taste that beer, you had a long day, this that bullshit hogwash. You failed. So now it's back to square one. 

Three weeks down the drain....just because you body wanted it so bad. 21 days for nothing....because you weren't intelligent enough to find another way to bide your time and destress. How great did it feel...and how ""good"" do you feel now that you failed. 

No one will know, no one will make fun of you or give you disappointed looks. There is no slap on the hand for this. There is only your shame, your guilt, and your familiar feeling of failure. The slight high you're feeling right now is accompanied by a dark cloud of angst and morose thoughts. 

It's not the release you used to get when you were younger. It's not the feeling of joy and happiness that'd have you reclining in your seat with the biggest smile you've ever experienced. There's no, ""hohooooo goddamn that was soooooo fucking good"", as the high mists it's way through your body and your head falls back while you dangle somewhere between sleep and heaven.

This is no reward. You ate that delicious looking berry off a pleasant looking tree and now you've poisoned yourself again. However, you knew the moment you ordered what you wanted, you'd be sick after. There was never a moment during that meal that you didn't know how you'd feel now. You were counting on it, thinking it would make this the last time. Except it's following your feelings that got you to this state. They've led you astray for years.

Your reason and intellect brought you to swear off meat and alcohol. Your knowledge and understanding guided your decision to become a healthier, more complete human being. Your feelings were only a factor to be considered after your completed your goal, when you'd feel proud of what you'd accomplished. 

Now that goal is farther away. As far as you originally made it plus the three weeks you just wasted.

She first met me a year ago during my 45 day streak (coincidence?) via work. (I attest that this streak helped me get that job).

I went quiet and she just nervously talked, and I interjected jokes that she found amusing--but it wasn't sexual. I was failing at taking initiative for at least 20min. I made a move.

She was on her period, and didn't want me to go down below--no actual sex, just tits. She wasn't responding as I hoped to the sexy yet controlled kissing. Eventually, I just let go a bit more and got very aggressive and she loved it. It's been so long since I had sex that I wonder if I need to really tap into this 'letting go' to get hard (I struggle with ED).

Afterwards, she said *happily* that she didn't think I would be like that.

I already blocked one of the websites that I relapsed on, but the other two are both otherwise useful (youtube and wikipedia). Yes, technically the videos aren't 'porn' but they're explicit enough, and they made me feel the same way.

I live at a dormitory to an international school in Asia, and summer break has started recently, and all my friends have moved back to their home countries. Basically there's nobody around to keep me accountable 24/7, so it's a lot easier to stray. I think it will be a bit easier to avoid when I move back to Australia and start working, but who can say for sure.

EDIT 2: Alright, so I have safety mode on Youtube, now (this disables the same videos inaccessible by under 18, as well as comments (you have to go to a separate page to view comments)) and I have installed K9 web protection, as recommended by one of you folks, disabling nudity and porn, among other things I don't care for.

I am 20 years old and I have a serious problem with porn. I started watching it and masturbate to it at age 14 or 15. Recently, I got my first girlfriend and realized I had ED (I mean, I was lying to myself thinking I simply was afraid of having sex but now I think it's much safer to assume I'm sick). We still didn't have sex. Not just for this reason, but the one or two times we tried I was not at the top of my performance.

We're longdistance for three months right now and I decided to try NoFap more seriously this time (I've been trying for almost one year, relapsing from time to time but having streaks of 7-10 days). I'm right now at day 17, which is my personal best, but things are not rosy.

I CAN'T prevent myself from looking at porn. It is impossible. For these 17 days, I looked EVERY SINGLE DAY at porn. I have to, it's stronger than me. I don't masturbate, I just sit and browse videos and watch, like this. I am crazy. I know it's bad, and obviously none of my ED problems are gone. It's like these 17 days are worth nothing. I still crave dopamine and I have to give it to my brain.

I tried to install an extension for blocking the websites but I always find a way around. I tried meditation, I read the YourBrainOnPorn series, I put all my heart in my hobbies, I tried to acknowledge the urge and simply chosing not to look at porn but it's like a drug. I swear, this is a life battle. I don't know if someone will understand my situation. I don't know what to do. I know I simply HAVE to discipline myself but it's like I refuse to give my mind the strength to do it.

Help me, please. I know there's no miracle cure but I'd like to hear a few words of advice, or people that were in the same boat as me.

I'm sick of myself. I'm not strong enough to resist the temptation.

TL;DR: I have an enormous porn addiction and don't know what to do. I don't masturbate but still look at porn. I'm starting to become mad.

If anyone disagrees with this view, please feel free to explain why and offer a better alternative.

1367688214.0,11,self.pornfree,1dopyg,Why can't I be like everyone else?,13,2,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/pornfree/comments/1dopyg/why_cant_i_be_like_everyone_else/,"Why can't I be able to look at porn and be fine like all my other friends? Why can't I just make all my problems go away by clicking that link? Why can't I just feel better about myself?

These are the questions that I've been asking myself lately as the urges have been arising. In the past this would have led to me feeling sorry for myself and subsequently trying to push away that pain by looking at porn for hours on end. The cruel twist of fate (as we all know) was that afterwards, I'd feel worse than I did before which led to more pain which, you guessed it, led to more porn. It was a downward spiral of anxiety and depression that lasted for years before finally coming to a tipping point 53 days ago when I said no more.

It's a bit scary knowing that I don't have that easy escape anymore and that I'm now trying to tackle my problems head-on instead of running away from them. But even when the urges are so strong it takes every fiber of my being to not give in, I don't regret this decision for one second. I know what the path looks like when porn is in my life and it's one I don't plan on following anymore. 

So why can't I be like everyone else? Because this is the life I have been given and I must accept that. Do I wish things had gone differently in the past? Oh boy, you better believe it. Is there anything I can do to change what has already happened? Not a chance in hell. Everything that has happened in my life has led up to this point. The only thing I can do now is to make better decisions going forward armed with the knowledge of my past experiences. 

Stay strong even when it feels like all is lost. Keep pushing everyday to become the person you want to be. There is *always* a choice. 


**Choose wisely.**

1367615934.0,12,self.pornfree,1dn5zu,MY rules for Pornfree. Another Guide to assist you on your journey.,17,5,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/pornfree/comments/1dn5zu/my_rules_for_pornfree_another_guide_to_assist_you/,"Basically, the main rule of this subreddit is DO NOT WATCH PORN.  
We're here because of a porn addiction/bad porn habits. We're here because we want to change or ways and become better than we were. Some of us are here just for fun, to see how long they can last. That's fine as long as you're not harming our community!  

Well, here are MY own personal rules for Pornfree:  

* **DO NOT watch porn**  
-Clearly, this number one rule. The fact that porn is all acting, pixlated, and pretty sloppy. It gives us false expectations and ridiculously obscene, unhealthy desires.  


* **DO NOT LOOK for/Browse for porn.**  
-This is my greatest weakness: The fact that I still have the desire to ""Look up"" a certain video. Maybe I wanna see what's new in the porn world, or see if they'd have a certain video, or find out if there's a certain kind of pornsite in existence. THIS is a bad habit that I'm trying to break. I don't want the desire for porn anymore!!  
What also counts as ""looking for"" porn. If you see an image thumbnail of a hot girl, in a bikini or bathing suit, and you CLICK ON IT. You're building yourself a trap, and walking right into it. STOP admiring her hot body if it's only gonna turn you on and fuel your cravings! Don't click on a link if it's NSFW, because you and I both know what it means. It means either Gore of Nudity. 50-50 chance of stumbling onto porn. Don't make the click, don't take the risk.  
If you're watching an R rated movie, and you're aware it has nudity and sex scenes, you should probably look away during those scenes, and think of something else. What I do if look at the corner of the screen, and think of colors until the scene is over. That's just me. If you purposely watch the movie for that particular scene, especially if you rewind the movie to that scene just to watch it again, you know it counts as breaking this rule!. do not lie to yourself!

This leads me to my next rule!  

* **DO NOT THINK about Porn**  
-Get rid of that porn infested mind. it's full of gross, unrealistic fantasies. You probably fap while you think about a girl riding your dick, well GUESS WHAT! That is **NOT YOUR** girl, and that is **NOT YOUR** dick!! That is some strangers dick, do you really think your dick is that big? Also, that girl isn't riding you, she's fucking some stranger. She has no clue you exist!  
Those fantasies you have, those thought you masturbate to. When you look at a hot girl on the streets, you imagine yourself doing her. The truth is, you're just replaying a memory of a porn video. That person doing the girl isn't you, and that girl that he's doing isn't the same girl you're looking at (unless you're looking at a porn star.) Think about this next time you fantasize.  

* if it wasn't made clear in the last rule, **DO NOT Fantasize!**  
-It can't be said any clearer. Fantasizing will only make you want to search for that certain video, thus leading you right back into the addiction you're fighting against! IF you catch yourself starting to fantasize, kill the thought right away. Get up, get moving, do something else that's productive. Get your mind busy, and OFF of the idea of porn. Go do pushups, or jog, or do your homework.

**What definitely counts as a reset?** Breaking the first two rules: Watching porn and searching for porn. The fact that you even bothered to look for it, it means your willpower is still weak, and you have no control over your bad habits. Gain some control! Do not give into your habits/addiction.
This being said, if you ACCIDENTALLY stumble upon porn. As long as you quickly X it out/walk away, you're fine!

**HERE** are some of my older post.  
http://www.reddit.com/r/pornfree/comments/1cy6ad/shields_against_porn_heres_a_list_of_content/  
http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1czb9f/the_fight_against_fap_the_ultimate_guide_to/  

They are two guides I've written to help assist my fellow Fapstronauts and Poreigners (idk what the names of us pornfree folks are, so came up with that. think of foreigner, but with a P). So feel free to use them as a resource to assist you during your NoFap-PornFree Journey!  

Eventually, if you follow these ""rules, tips and tricks"" that I've provided for you, you may lead yourself into a positively healthy, NoFaPornFree lifestyle.  
**As I have said,** these are the personal rules I've created for myself. I'm sharing them with you as a contribution to this community in hopes that it may be helpful to all of you! It's all up to you whether or not you want to follow them!  

Thanks for reading!!  

**EDIT:**  
I'd like to ad something to my ""Do not look for porn"" rule! Do not search for non-nudes of porn stars. don't even search for anything non-nude that's sexual related. examples: girls in bikinis, girls in yoga pants, girls with nice butt/boobs. Any of these are possible triggers. This is also considered ""edging."" You're trying to rid your eyes of porn, yet you still think it's okay to search for an alternative (which isn't much of an alternative. It's pretty much the same thing!) Just **DON'T!!!**  
Also, don't look for porn or anything porn related (Unless it's for research, or trying to overcome porn addiction. Example: Your Brain on Porn.)  

**EDIT:** nudes of your GF or some chick you know. You decide. I say, as long as you don't let them get the best of you, it's fine!

1367583415.0,11,self.pornfree,1dm544,Masturbation without porn. It's a whole new world.,20,9,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/pornfree/comments/1dm544/masturbation_without_porn_its_a_whole_new_world/,"So I'm 8 days into my second attempt at being porn-free. I'm also trying to cut back on masturbation as much as I can, and during my first attempt I recognised that sometime between the first and second weeks, I begin to have natural urges. If left, these begin to dominate my thoughts, I become horny as hell and all my thoughts turn to sex.
My mistake during the first attempt was to NOT act on these urges. This built up such intense feelings that I ended up relapsing and used porn to masturbate.
Now, on my second attempt, I recognised the same urges were building up, so rather than continue, trying to battle against the building urges, I allowed myself to masturbate - on one obvious condition. No porn.
What followed was really surprising. Having not looked at porn for a while, porn did NOT enter my mind at all. It was not at the 'tip of my tongue' if you know what I mean, like it normally is when I'm using it too much.
Instead, I was able to experience masturbation in a much more natural way. I enjoyed it for what it was, and it felt SO much better! It felt honest, it felt intense, and it felt 'clean'. Strange word to use! But that's how it felt.
As much as I enjoyed it, I was also aware that I was doing it for a purpose too - and my rule is that I only allow myself to masturbate when I feel the real deep need, for the sake of controlling my porn addiction.
But it was really surprising how I didn't think of porn while I was doing it. That was encouraging, as I guess porn may be losing its grip on my brain.",,False,,t5_2rglh,False,,month2,True,t3_1dm544,http://www.reddit.com/r/pornfree/comments/1dm544/masturbation_without_porn_its_a_whole_new_world/,

It's been two weeks since my fiancée caught me lying about my addiction (original post [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/pornfree/comments/1bhehc/i_got_caught/))

We talked it over and came up with a plan to reach our goal, which is that I never relapse again. It's a tall order, but I feel ready, willing, and able. (I've already made longer without porn than I have in quite a while)

* I'm being completely honest with her, meaning that if I feel the slightest bit tempted to relapse I tell her immediately.
* I'm seeing my therapist again.
* She's installed K9, which I don't have access to mess with.
* I'm working on changing my entire lifestyle so as to eliminate as many triggers as possible (most of which were sheer boredom)

It's been going fantastic so far, and I feel much closer to my fiancée than ever. I just wanted to let you guys know how it was going, and as always hopefully give you encouragement to make it through this. Something I realized while talking to her is that, while tough, it is possible to quit my addiction without another relapse. I know the common vibe around here is ""you're going to relapse several times, but as long as you keep trying you'll get better,"" and there's nothing wrong with that mentality, but for her I've got to do better than that.

I'm 16 years old, and have been addicted to Porn since I was about 11. It blows my mind to think that I was exposed to such explicit material at such a young age. I'm tired of being in such a dark place in my mind. Because lately I have not been able to shut my mind out from negative thoughts. I blame it on my porn and internet use... So i've decided that i'm going to lay off the computer for a while, and start drawing some more. Here are some of my most recent drawings... I have a lot more, but I can't find them right now. I love art and I feel like if I got myself into a big project, it would keep my mind off of porn and help me relax. I'm a big fan of Macklemore, so i'm thinking of doing a very interpretive drawing of Macklemore and Ryan Lewis's song ""Neon Cathedral""... I also am going to write my screenplay idea, and continue making my 7 second ""Vine"" videos. Because i'm finally starting to gain a following on that App. 

So if anyone is struggling, try and replace your internet use with something more productive to keep your mind off of things. For me, it is Art. And just know that all of you guys that are trying to do something about your addiction have the advantage over everyone else. Stay strong!

I have a friend doing NoFap and he's 80+ days in and notices changes. 

I try not to judge other people or tell them what to do, but a friend came to me with some concerns over his relationship. Based on what he said, his behavior, and general lack of tact when it comes to the topic of sex, I mentioned that he may be interested in abstaining from porn for one month. I didn't tell him to stop masturbating, just that he may not listen to me, but that based on what he was saying I felt like he could benefit from trying to stop watching porn, if only for a short time.

Well, it did NOT go well. He got really pissed off and said he wasn't looking for a ""cure"" for himself, even though I mentioned nothing about a cure, and that he was happy with all of his fetishes and it's because of porn that he can explore everything and there is so much to experience in the world, then he switched topics. I'm not saying that quitting porn should be what everyone does, but he sounded like a defensive drug addict and it was kind of pathetic.

when making a significant change to one's life, you have to literally *become a different person*. most people are uncomfortable with that on a very visceral level. we want to change our habits without changing our identity, who we are, but it's not possible, especially with something that's become truly addictive. if you're 'a person who wants to look at porn but doesn't', then you'll *constantly* be fighting with yourself, you'll be in conflict with your desires. you really have to change yourself into '*a person who doesn't want to look at porn*'.

more easily said than done, right? of course. it takes a lot of humility, of 'faking it until you make it', etc. it's a kind of zen thing - you have to get outside yourself, and be open to letting *who you are* be changed at the deepest level. [this post by the last pychiatrist blog](http://thelastpsychiatrist.com/2012/06/amy_schumer_offers_you_a_look.html) is a really, really important read, and sums up a lot of these ideas. most importantly:

&gt; For a great many people this leads to an unconscious, default hierarchy in the mind, I'm not an epidemiologist but you got it in you sometime between the ages of 5 and 10:

&gt; &lt;doing awesome&gt;

&gt; is better than

&gt; &lt;feeling terrible about yourself&gt;

&gt; is better than

&gt; &lt;the mental work of change&gt;

&gt; You should memorize this, it is running your life.  ""I'm constantly thinking about ways to improve myself.""  No, you're gunning the engine while you're up on blocks.  Obsessing and ruminating is a skill at which we are all tremendously accomplished, and admittedly that feels like mental work because it's exhausting and unrewarding, but you can no more ruminate your way through a life crisis than a differential equation.

thinking about yourself as a new kind of person also makes relapse less of a big deal. if you're a person who wants to look at porn but chooses not to, then you'll see a relapse as a major personal failing, a regression, a rolling back of all the work you've done because it breaks your perfect streak. if you've managed to mold yourself into a person who doesn't want to look at porn, then if you happen to relapse, it's not a big deal, because you're *still a person who doesn't want to look at porn*. your defense is in your identity.

sorry if this is kind of rambly, i didn't really structure this very well. i hope this helps some people with their self-improvement journeys, whether kicking porn or anything else. if nothing else, it probably helped me just to type it out and remind myself of it. read the tlp article, read it critically, and take it to heart. trust me. sometimes i think he's full of shit, but most of this article is incredibly spot-on. i come back to it regularly.",,False,,t5_2rglh,1358918526.0,,month5,True,t3_173n5y,http://www.reddit.com/r/pornfree/comments/173n5y/a_philosophy_thats_helped_me_in_past/,

I had a browse through NoFap and what people had been saying about social anxiety going away and gaining confidence after not fapping sounds awesome. The thing is, I have no trouble with my confidence.

The only reason I've ended up here is because I went back to a girl's place Saturday night and we were both insanely horny but I literally could not get it up for the life of me.

The other thing is, I was exercising twice a day for a couple of weeks but didn't ever get much sleep and one day my body just completely gave up and I felt fatigued for ages.

I don't usually wake up with an erection, but I have lost a lot of weight so I'm seeing how much my overall physical well being is having an effect but after reading a lot of stuff I definitely believe that it is because of my porn addiction.

So, my question is - do you guys just not watch porn but still fap and get your erection back? Surely before the internet guys would just masturbate every night and then fall asleep?

Do you guys NoFap because it forces you to meet women? I don't have this trouble but definitely want to go porn free. I feel that I'm not addicted to fapping, just to porn.

I've been trying since April, for the record. 

To actually figure out what it feels like to have a craving, and what the after effects are... it really helped me be more aware of the way my brain works against me sometimes. I learned to read my own mental environment and evaluate what my 'scumbag brain' wants me to do, consciously, so I know *I'm* the one in control. That feeling is incredibly empowering.

I'm a bit stuck on what to do next, though. I don't feel the need to be off porn forever; I just want to make sure that when I go back it's in a responsible and limited way that doesn't undo all my hard work. So I guess I'm looking for ideas about hard limits that I can stick to, so I know my ""scumbag brain"" doesn't get the best of me. I find objective limits are very helpful for me.

What do other post-pornfreers do? Is a ""once every X days"" rule effective for you? How about a ""once every X faps"" rule?

I have been addicted to porn since I was 14, 23 now. 9 Years of little to no restraint on how much porn I watch, and during my college years it was the worst (I would regularly, daily, get high and watch shemale porn which is more stimulating than regular porn).

It's hard to admit that I have an addiction, but it's a part of overcoming it. This subreddit allows me to do it anonymously and consistently (maybe).

I took my first step to reducing my porn use about 8 months ago. Looking back I have come a pretty long way. Yesterday, for the first time, in my life, ever, I was able to browse through a tube website without having an impulse to open a video, watch it, and you know what comes next. Still for some reason I wanted to open it, as if there was a memory of something satisfying in it when I know there is no satisfaction, only shame.

I started 8 months ago and did not have a set goal other than no overstimulation. Stick to one porn video and change it every 3-4 weeks. It was better than before, but still I had relapses where I just wanted to discover more porn. And until now every once in a while, I will relapse and find a new video.

So this is my challenge for 2013. a porn free year with this subreddit supporting me and me supporting other members.

Because I will feel like i failed *the whole year*. I think in absolutes like that. So, my only point is, don't.

I don't even have it in my mind to completely quit, just reduce the time spent on this.

So here's the problem, I already quit cold turkey like 5-6 times and a month later, I try to recover everything I had and then some.  I'm up to a 5TB collection and before I get told it's huge, I have a really fast connection and downloading 60GB overnight is no big deal.  I have a multitude of 100GB+ torrents that I looked at one or two movies and never paid attention to again.  But to delete them, I feel compelled to look at the entire set or it's just downright painful to get rid of it.

I would daresay I spend maybe only 15 minutes a day fapping but much more time collecting - and that part is the bigger problem.  Well that, and HDD space.  I spent way more time on self-pleasure as a teen than I do now.

Maybe I'm better off asking a packrat forum, I feel my computer is more a version of one of those reality shows where those people can't throw anything away.  A hoarder.

Everytime I give in, I then spend an inordinate amount of time trying to get my collection back (and amass an even larger one in the process) rather than anything, so I hope people can understand my reluctance to do that again.

Laughs.  I hope that didn't sound too pathetic :)  BTW, before anyone asks, I have the same obsession with a huge nonporn picture collection as well.  I think it's beyond the porn.

Which is weird, I have the opposite problem in real life.  I'm usually a minimalist and want to throw many things away - often too soon.  My dad was a hoarder and I hated growing up with it, only to get the bug digitally.

I have a very low self esteem (my fault I know) and I knew he watched porn before and it bothered me, but when I got here and found out he continued to watch porn every day except nights I slept over, it really hurt me. I haven't broken up with him over it, or even taken a break, and I don't plan to. The past month he's taken the initiative to really try (letting his ipod touch die, not using his computer, etc.) and has only relapsed a couple times.

The problem I'm having is that every time he relapses, I try to be as supportive as possible but it just destroys me. It hurts so bad emotionally is starts to hurt physically and then I don't want him to touch me because it makes me feel so awful. So where do I go from here pornfree? I came to you because you guys know whats going on from his point of view. I just CANNOT understand what's going on in his head, and it's becoming increasingly difficult to choke down my feelings about it and not become a crying mess. I'm trying.

And while many of you would probably not consider anything I ever look at as porn, the fact is that I *am* watching it to become aroused, and for no other reason.  

The problem is that I'm using arousing images to self-medicate for my relationship-related despair.  See, I'm incredibly lonely.  I haven't been in a relationship in over 5 years now (and I'm not one to do casual sex or one night stands).  This hasn't bothered me before, but something is up.

See, my life is finally stable enough that I can look around and see two things:

1. My existence (don't call it a life: I have no hobbies, no interests, and a severe case of anhedonia that everyone, my therapist included, seems to ignore which prevents me from even *wanting* interests or hobbies) is devoid of the intimacy (both emotional and physical, but more so the former) that I need for mood regulation and proper mental function.
2. I have [learned helplessness](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learned_helplessness) when it comes to dealing with relationships.  While I have been in two relationships (one abusive, the other just plain crazy--and in the latter case, I'm talking about both of us), both relationships were initiated by the girl, not me.  I have never successfully asked a woman out (that question was always met with a no)--and I have not done so in over 11 years.
3. Pursuant to number 2 above, I have an ugly history of manufacturing my own rejection.  

So if I'm looking at arousing images, I am lonely (because there is nobody in my life), desperate (for someone to come in and change the fact that I am lonely), and depressed (because nobody will save me).

What's more, this is pretty much a cycle in my life: I get stable enough, realize that I'm still in this spot, then I disrupt everything and run away while I'm at the depth of the episode (or alternately, as I hit rock bottom, everything gets taken away).

So I think I should spend more time over here. 

I am what? 3 days into this and not fapping is totally easy. These days and for many years, I really don't fap unless porn is involved. And when I do simply fap while not watching porn, porn is very much involved I have go there in my thoughts to get the motivation. Cycle through multiple fantasies. Its a hard habit to break, to say the least. I find it extremely hard not to go back to those old reliable sites and look around, the irony though is when I see the porn, when I see a guy having sex with someone. I realize how envious I am of him and people like him. Someone who can have sex with out it being a nervous worried ordeal, constantly praying and trying to get and keep an erection. Someone who can enjoy a blow job or hand job or simply enjoy the pleasures of sex. To put a condom on with out going limp even. 

Its a sad realization as I am sneaking porn that this very act is what keeps me from participating and having, what I so love to watch.

I caught on to his porn addiction in early Feb. which certainly explained our dead bedroom, we fought, we talked, and he has been cold turkey ever since.

Our relationship itself has flourished, we have never been more emotionally intimate.  Only, now he has all kinds of sexual dysfunction in bed.  

He cums after maybe 5 minutes of penetration, and is only at half-mast those entire 5 minutes.  I now get no pleasure out of sex.  I guess this is better than no sex for months at a time but I do miss the way he could last before and at least have a normal erection...

I've gently tried broaching this outside of bed and he has stated that he never knew how addicted to porn he was before, I told him how lots of guys take time to get back to normal, but honestly, I feel really turned off by all of this.

I never stopped feeling attracted to him in our years together.  He claims the same, but he would consistently choose porn &amp; masturbation over me, I felt like he was cheating on me because he stopped putting out for long periods of time and chose instead to jerk off in his car or at work.  I tried to switch it up, kept in shape, bought lingerie, I'm open to all kinds of things but he is very vanilla in bed to begin with and I've been able to accept that.  The porn he watched varied but honestly it was pretty tame by today's standards so I don't think he's missing anything but the variety of girls and his own deathgrip...  

He's not the cheating kind, it made him sick to even talk about breaking up or opening up the relationship.  He felt guilty over his addiction and I had no idea aside from the dead bedroom that there was a problem.

I'm just at a loss here.  I want to have sex, I'd love to be his own personal porn star, he just can't get it all the way up now and he can't last.  I feel like porn has completely killed our sex life.  I can't even feel him inside of me anymore and even though I still have a high sex drive I cringe at the thought of what will happen in bed each time.  What do we try next?  Does time fix this?

So I've been dating this great girl since June of '09, we were both in high school at the time, she 2 years younger than me. I've been on and off porn addiction since I was about 12, I'd say probably 4-5 major relapses in the past 6 years (I'm 18 almost 19 now). We've had a pretty good relationship, of course ups and downs but overall we were extremely happy with each other. She was the first girl I ever did any real fooling around with, and for about the first 6 months I watched no porn and was incredibly happy (I hadn't watched porn for a few months before we started dating also). I had told her I had struggled with Porn through my life from the beginning.

**The Beginning:**
The amount of our fooling around started to drift away due to some personal issues, and I started to get really horny and feel 'unsatisfied' around December of '09 (Just an estimate). One day, I don't remember how it came up but we talked about watching porn together and both agreed it sounded entertaining. We watched it for a very long time that day, and we actually had a lot of fun together. Well that night I asked her if I could watch it on my own. She didn't like that at all, and I don't think I did that first night.

**The Addiction:**
So on and off we're watching porn together, in person or over iChat screen sharing. But I began to ask more and more to watch it when she wasn't keeping me company. Most of the time she would say no, sometimes she would be so generous to let me. I would take extreme advantage of these times and watch it 2-10 times a day. This killed her inside and she couldn't keep letting me do it. So eventually it got to where she would not say it was okay anymore. I tried really hard not to watch it and I don't really remember how successful I was, I'm sure nowhere near 100% but I definitely wanted it a lot of the time.

**College + Addiction**
So when the time came for college, I chose SDSU because it was literally 5 minutes from my girlfriends house and was a great school. I wanted to live on campus because I wanted to live that close to my girlfriend, and the college made it mandatory for freshman. Well this turned out horribly for my struggle with porn. No parents to limit time on the computer. way more free time, only working on the weekend and only about 3 hours of class a day. I would spend every evening from 2-11 with my girlfriends, but I normally stay up until 1-3 am. Every time we would fight I would watch porn, usually multiple times. She told me this killed her but it never seemed real when I watched it. I would always just play it off and think ""it's not a big deal, or well she's being mean to me so why should I care?"" It got to the point where she was saying that if I watched it again, our relationship would end. The fights got more and more frequent since she was so hurt by me watching porn from the last time we fought, and it eventually got to where we were fighting/I was watching porn every weekend. 

**The End:**
Now, about a month ago I watched porn, this was the last straw for her and she ended it. I did everything I could to win her back, I begged and pleaded and tried as hard as I could to do things that would help with my addiction, and after about 6 days she agreed. Then I went 2 weeks without watching porn, but then I start to feel unsatisfied again and I try to communicate this need to her but she can't bring herself to fool around with me because she's still heartbroken after this year long trend of pornography and fighting, along with other issues from her own life. so after two weeks, I watched porn. 7 times. She's done with me. She doesn't want to be friends, she doesn't want to be anything. I can't imagine my life without her. the first few days I tried to ignore it and just say that it would be like every other time, but I really don't think it is. She means it this time. Now I feel empty. I'd do anything to win her back but it doesn't feel like there's anything I can do. I'm trying to once and for all break this addiction, I've said this every single time I watched it, and every time I meant it, but then as things started to get better I would forget to keep doing the things I know I should. 

**Here's some steps I'm going to try to take:**

* Going to church, I've grown up in a christian family and I really dig Church, I stopped going when I started working about 2 years ago, and I really miss it. I feel like when I go to church, and do the whole religious thing, which I won't get into here, it makes the biggest impact on my addiction. The problem is I get too lazy and stop doing them, which I need to stop doing.

* The next step is going to a local church's group for men to fight sexual temptation. basically a biblical support group. I've never gone as I've always been too embarrassed, but  I think it's time to man up and try it.

* I need to get a hobby. I'm not really talented at anything, I've never stuck with anything long enough to get good at it, but I feel like if I had something to do in my spare time, maybe that would take my mind off of sexual things. I recently started played Starcraft 2, but I'm pretty horrible and playing just makes me feel hopeless :/

* STOP MASTURBATING. I jack off at least once a day, usually 2-3 times, when I'm not watching porn. I think this puts a lot of stress on my sex drive, and when I have nothing to satisfy it, it makes the fight against porn an uphill battle.

**Current Feelings:**
These are the current things I'm trying. Church is Sunday morning, I should read my bible today and tomorrow, and everyday. The church group is Monday I believe, I know they also hold them tuesday and wednesday, but I don't know if it's just a repeat of monday's  material. I've tried hobby searching before, so I guess I'll just continue that search. I haven't masturbated since the last time I watched porn, yesterday morning. I talked to my now ex yesterday after watching porn and she said to at least not talk to her until I've gone a month without doing anything sexual, but she thinks that even after that we won't get back together.  I've felt a little suicidal, although I know I could never actually do it, because I'm very afraid of death, very aware of how much it will hurt everyone I know, and very intolerant of pain. I've self harmed before, but I can't even take that pain. I've tried cutting a few times over the past few days, but it hurts too much and I only managed to accidentally cut my thumb once with a butter knife. I feel depressed and I can't imagine a future without this girl in my life. I don't want another girl, and I don't want to be alone. I just want this girl back, and to break this addiction. 

*any advice is greatly appreciated, thanks for listening to my story.*
if you are in my place a few steps back, don't make the same mistakes I did. get help. tell someone. no matter how hard it is. it's not worth hurting yourself and the people you love the way it does.

tl;dr version of my story would be that I recently fooled around with someone and experienced ED; went through a variety of sources to try and find what was wrong with me before I stumbled upon r/nofap and then r/yourbrainonporn.  That was a week ago.

Since then, I've been trying my best to keep at both, and while the nofap has been difficult (I've relapsed twice, mostly due to morning wood) I've found going pornfree a great deal easier.

My porn use has been on/off since I was about 13, but it's the past 2 years or so where I'd say it became more of a habit.  Looking at it now, I'd say that's also when I started experiencing less intense erections, although I only realised what that meant when I hooked up with someone (i.e. less-than-full erections which didn't last as long as I wanted them to).

Anyway, I wanted to ask you guys whether going pornfree was an experience that got easier the longer you went without; or got more difficult?  Due to how I thought pornfree &amp; nofap were inherintly linked, I imagined that relapsing with one would lead to relapsing with another, but so far I've not had any strong urges to view porn.

Thanks in advance for any advice &amp; help you can give.

Yes, I'm ashamed.
But, no I'm not giving up. I know I can beat this thing.
But yes, I finally give into the fact that this is an addiction, and something I can't beat on my own.
I've tried for two freaking years trying to overcome this, and nothing I've done on my own has worked. So I finally got realistic, and decided on what I needed to do.

The first is I need people to be accountable to. Don't get me wrong here, /r/pornfree is litterally the best thing that has ever happened to me. I've gotten to my record thanks to this wonderful place, but I need something more personal, someone I can call on the phone in the moment of distress. A few of you have given me your phone numbers to call, I can't express how much joy that gives me knowing I can talk to someone about this (and I've almost got my phone fixed, so I'll be talkin to you soon! =)

The second being I've started a religiously adapted 12 step program from my church I found online that I need to work through to over come this. This is to help me fight my addiction, and help me gain back my spiritual identity. I like this one because they found a willing group and made a podcast of their meeting, and I can listen in. Its wonderful.

The third is I just need to stop. One of the top voted threads on this subreddit says something to the effect of, ""my name is BlahBlahBlah, and I don't do porn"". I just don't do it any more.

The final one is I'm going to seek solace in music. Its my escape pod out of this, a few precious minutes when everything is fine, and I just can enjoy. 

I know there is no magic bullet for this, but I'm going to fight like a bat out of hell. My birthday (my real one, not reddit :) is in two days. I hope, pray, need and want and **WILL** have that be 356 days by next year on August tenth. No more crap. We can do this.

Think about it. For years, we've seen perfectly chiseled men, shaved and manscaped with perfect hair and big penises fucking girls (or other dudes who look exactly the same) and it made us feel inadequate. But now - we know we are men who are awesome in our own ways. 

Maybe porn distorted what we should think men should look like, and dropped our confidence in ourselves to the point we were avoiding contact with women because we felt we didn't ""measure up.""

I'll never finish it and it's just going to be a huge waste of time and effort.""**

**Apathy:** A state of indifference, or the suppression of emotions such as concern, excitement, motivation and passion.

**Defeatism:**  Acceptance of defeat without struggle, without even trying.

That's what I felt like after my last relapse last week.  I am currently trying to create a social networking site, starting from basic HTML/CSS knowledge, learning at codecademy.com, and using my dreams as my motor.  After my relapse, the overwhelming feeling of apathy and defeatism toward the project overcame me--and it scared me.  

I remembered that feeling.  I can remember feeling this way many, many times throughout my entire life.  As I've cut way back on PMO--dropping down streaks of 53 days, 42 days, multiple 20+ days--that awful ""defeatapathy"" was either waning or gone.  After that last relapse, it flooded through me, powerful enough to shake me.  BUT since I've had many streaks of pornfree, enough to **clear my mind and heal my brain a bit**, I was able to see it happening.

""Wait.  What?  Why am I so negative? WTF is going on?""  I asked myself.  And it dawned on me...

**All those years of not succeeding at my goals is inextricably linked to PMO.**

My workout goals, my relationship goals, my career goals, EVERYTHING gets negatively affected.

I don't ever want that awful, destructive, disturbing feeling again.  I have too much I want to accomplish.  

So, even though I've gone 5 days pornfree, I'm resetting today.  I've set up a bunch of goals to achieve in the next 100 days--my goal is to be pornfree for the next 100 days.  Here's to day 1. Wish me luck.

1374355503.0,11,self.pornfree,1iprni,Thoughts and Encouragement - I'm 83 days porn free,14,3,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/pornfree/comments/1iprni/thoughts_and_encouragement_im_83_days_porn_free/,"I started on noFap, partially because I did not realize this subreddit existed. I made it 54 days without porn or masturbation before I ended up fapping. I continued to masturbate very sparingly for awhile.

This last week I wanted to experiment a bit, so I have fapped almost once a day for the last week or so.

I just want to say it is very very easy to get off on just simple fantasy/imagination (no using porn memories). I think it takes a minute or two on average to get off and it doesn't take aggressive stroking.
Today I ended up masturbating twice in the same day and I'm actually a bit surprised at how easy it is to get off without porn now.

Let me tell you, before I stopped watching porn, it would have been impossible for me to get off because of the lack of sensitivity, no matter how hard I tried.

The point I am trying to get across is once you accomplish the disconnect from porn masturbation can still be just as enjoyable and easy to do.

I think restricting masturbation in general is extremely helpful, when you stop fapping altogether, you gain a lot of sensitivity which makes for less of a need for other stimuli. Also you don't want to imagine pornographic images when you masturbate, so this can also help with that.

The key is self control and discipline; master your own body to improve your relationships with a SO.

1374345092.0,11,self.pornfree,1ipghu,An Addictive Cycle,11,0,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/pornfree/comments/1ipghu/an_addictive_cycle/,"As someone who is battling addiction, not just with porn, I have found there is a bit of a cycle to it for me. Using some of this information, I have overcome addictions for things other than porn. I did manage to go over one hundred non-consecutive days without porn, but I ended up justifying relapses to myself.

I don't know if it is this way for others, but if it is, this information can be useful.

Stage 1: Discontent.

In this stage, a lack of something, be it pleasure or entertainment, or the presence of something one wants to escape, be it stress or anxiety, causes oneself to weigh their options for a solution. This step is not unhealthy if it leads to something productive or non-destructive, but if it leads to one choosing porn (or whatever bad addiction) as the solution, it leads to stage 2.

Stage 2: Craving.

This is the stage at which one feels the desire to indulge in the addiction.

Stage 3: Planning.

In this stage, it is already decided to satisfy the craving, and one plans on how to do so. This stage often leads to stage 4, but can skip to stage 5.

Stage 4: Justifying.

This stage only occurs if one has any inkling of thought that the addiction is a problem. This is the stage in which one convinces themselves it's not a problem. Reasons I used included ""you were able to have an orgasm without porn, so it's okay to watch porn,"" ""if you only do it x amount of time, it won't do any damage,"" ""you wouldn't let yourself watch it every day anyway,"" and ""it feels good.""

Stage 5: Acting.

One acts on the addiction, and feels a moment's pleasure.

Stage 6: Regretting.

After the moment of pleasure, one regrets what they have done, often feels bad about themselves, vows never to do it again and/or beats themselves up over it.

Stage 7: Numbing. 

To remedy the bad feelings towards oneself, the person puts it out of sight and out of mind, not addressing it, making it easier for a recurrence.

So when faced with these stages, I advise this:

Stage 1: Start with telling yourself that porn is not an option.

Stage 2: Go somewhere you cannot satisfy the craving, immerse yourself in another task, repeat that porn is not an option, and/or remind yourself of what you hope to gain by quitting the addiction.

Stage 3: Remind yourself where you will end up if you go through with it, of the regret and self-loathing you will feel.

Stage 4: Remind yourself that absolutely nothing justifies watching porn. Remind yourself of how you're getting in the way of your goals, or whatever helps you stop.

Stage 5: Remind yourself how fake what you're doing is, how you will end up feeling, how it gets in the way of your goals, or whatever else motivates you to stop.

Stage 6: Immerse yourself in the regret. Let it hurt you. Feel bad about it. It's a regret for a reason. But remember you have goals, and that you want to improve. Do not beat yourself up, just feel bad about the action.

Stage 7: Like stage 6, if you get to that point, regret is a motivator to stop the addiction.

Of course, all of this is only one side of the coin. What I've found really important on the other side is to find another desire that takes a higher priority that is something other than quitting the addiction. If your number one desire over watching porn is to stop the addiction, justifying a relapse when you get a craving will be much more potent at destroying you like it is for me.

i would always return to porn to reassure myself and would get rock hard, especially with my real crack cocaine of porn: webcam shows. this allowed me to rationalize my PIED as just being not attracted to the girl, or some other factor. i tried all kinds of boner pills and for a while with my girlfriend would never have sex unless i had had a strong cup of coffee, taken some arginine or butea superba or maca, and had laid off masturbating for a couple days. it was like i would plan my week around my webcam and PMO sessions to try and perform with her a couple times w eek - which wasn't enough for her!

since becoming abstinent (about 52 days ago with a couple incidents of relapse after 3 weeks, but 30 days straight with no PM now)  i noticed IMMEDIATE improvement of my ED. we had sex a couple times a day for the first couple weeks, and now have settled into a nice rhythm of having really satisfying sex 7 to 9 times a week - which is probably pretty close to the number of orgasms i was having with PMO!

in addition, our sex has gotten better because, in spite of the hurt she still deals with from finding out about my secret addiction, she now can feel i am not hiding anything, holding anything back or struggling with the psychological burden of PIED.

it has been gut wrenchingly sad and humiliating to realize that all of my ED experiences when single with hot girls who were totally up for it was DIRECTLY caused by PMO and NOTHING else....i had gone to doctors, taken testosterone supplements etc... it has also been incredibly relieving and empowering to realize i still work great down there as long as i break this nasty hold that cybersex had over my brain.",,False,,t5_2rglh,False,,,True,t3_1icj70,http://www.reddit.com/r/pornfree/comments/1icj70/my_liberating_journey_out_of_pied_porn_induced/,

1. Porn is disgusting (Child porn, Incest porn, etc)
2. Its a kind of social re-engineering. Societies that were modest and conservative, had values and culture are now nowhere to be seen.
3. Child rapist when interviewed for a study said that they watched porn of disgusting type.
4. Normal sex life is destroyed if you watch porn.
5. Porn is anti-human behaviour. It is anti-sex.
6. It destroys mind, body, society, children, family, intimacy, ...
7. It destroys marriage.
8. It is racist.
9. People lose jobs, families. They become violent. 
10. By watching porn you are supporting exploitation of sisters, daughters and women. You are promoting physical and verbal abuse of women.
11. It destroys you spiritually. 
12. We have to protect women in the whole of society and porn does just the opposite of that.
13. Porn is the end of masculinity.
14. It destroys intimacy and is all about masturbation and self satisfaction.

Impact on brain
==============
Dopamine - Neurotransmitter. Related with Pleasure, Motivation, Feel good factor. Its linked to most addiction.
Access of porn is so easy, that you want harder and harder. Your time and life is getting destroyed.
Porn keeps dopamine surging. Its synthetic &amp; artificial. So its has very deep, bad and long lasting effect on your brain. It re-wires your brain.

It can’t be to avoid a problem, to fantasize, to go to sleep, to get rid of boredom or loneliness. Those are things that need a different solution. The act of MO'ing is to satisfy that animalistic side of you that is biologically programmed to reproduce but before doing so, you have to make sure that 100 percent of you is okay with acting out; just like sex, it has to be consensual, even when it's with yourself. There is an emotional/rational side and an animalistic side to all of us.  This can be hard, especially to people who were raised with a negative view on masturbation like i was. Sex or masturbation was never talked about in the house and anytime that church mentioned it, the devil was also mentioned.
In order for a healthy masturbation session, i think things have to be natural and under control. By natural i mean: no fantasizing, no porn, or any other form of outside stimulus. By under control i mean, you're 100 percent okay with it and it's limited. Just like your emotional/rational side agrees to MO on a certain day, your animalistic side needs to agree not to MO on other days. The ability to say no, not today is really important. I think planning out days in which you MO and sticking with that schedule is vital.
I'm not a scientist or anything but this is just what i think about healthy masturbation at the moment. I've tried nofap for quite a while but it just doesn't work for me.

I try to ignore the fact that I've never made it past day 12 before and I project all of my faults on the rest of the redditors here who struggle with porn because I did not want to face the fact that fighting my addiction is so much more difficult than I ever thought it would be.

The portrayal of his habits was reasonable enough, but aside from the guy losing his wife (which turns out to have nothing to do with his porn habit as in a bizarre plot twist she ends up becoming a porn star herself) and hitting ""rock bottom"" when he masturbates in an adult video store, the movie does little to represent the real detriments of his addiction.

His recovery process is actually fairly well-represented at parts as it shows him jogging to fight his urge to touch himself and removing all porn from his household. The one thing they fall significantly short on though is motivation as he is quitting so that he can make a ""touching"" documentary to show a judge and get some leniency on his pending court case regarding his public masturbation. This rock bottom scenario not only does not feel realistic as I do not believe a reclusive porn addict would all of a sudden go so uncharacteristically exhibitionist, but seems such an indirect consequence of his addiction that he never really needs to face *why* he needs to stop so much as *that* he needs to stop.

2) Along with the main character, a few other addicts are portrayed in the film in his support group. The main one is ""Bob"" who is the group leader. On the other extreme of the protagonist, Bob is a reformed addict who has been celibate for nearly a decade. It's never clear why he felt he needed to go from complete addiction to long-term celibacy but it sets the stage for his relapse at the end of the story. What I dislike about these extremes is that there is no portrayal of an earnest sex-positive recovering addict, only reluctant and celibate ones.

3) The biggest reason I do not recommend this film is for its content, as it is essentially soft core porn. I expected to see some skin, especially toward the beginning, but as the ridiculous plot unfolded, the adult content persisted steadily throughout. This directorial choice makes the film entirely unwatchable for an actual recovering porn addict.

Fortunately for me, none of it felt like *my* variety of porn and I did not feel tempted to relapse, but it still triggered my ""porn dreams,"" usually either of me idly wasting time looking at porn or getting caught by a friend or family member, which I had not had since I quit porn almost 2 weeks ago and hope do not persist.

TL;DR Movie was disappointing as it had few actual ""Confessions"" and did not represent porn addiction in an authentic way while also being a minefield of triggers for an actual porn addict.",,False,,t5_2rglh,False,,week2,True,t3_1f13eu,http://www.reddit.com/r/pornfree/comments/1f13eu/confessions_of_a_porn_addict_film/,

I let an image play over in my mind for approximately 1 minute.  Not sure why I didn't follow my game plan.  I touched a little, edged, then started watching porn, fapped, and now, I feel like shit.

I believe my downfall was pride.  I thought I could do this without a higher power.  I relied on the strength of my own arm.  I now realize how weak I really am.  

Gents, I don't care what you believe in, but please, believe in something more than yourselves.  For those of us who have been through AA, we're taught to rely on a higher power.  Somehow, as a human, looking to a higher power gives us that added strength during our moments of weakness.

It's day one again.  For those of you who have relapsed, you know the pattern:  Relapse, feel like shit, make grandiose promises of how you'll never do this again because (insert whatever reason you haven't used yet), and then start marching down the path of sobriety again.

I'm not going to make any grandiose promises.  I will, however, promise to all of you that I'll always be honest.  When I screw up, I'll tell you.  I'm accountable to all of you, and ask for your continued support as I dust myself off, readjust my game plan, get some spirituality back into my life, and start walking down that crooked road to recovery.

But I saw how the man treated the women, and then I thought about my girlfriend. Then I thought, ""if you give in, is this what you're saying you like? Would you treat _____ that way? Is this how you would express how much you care about her?""

I thought about it for all of two seconds. No. I don't want to treat her like that. I don't want to think of her like that.

First discovered porn at age 12 thanks to our trusty Windows PC.
Started fapping around age 13-14, I can't remember exactly when.
Fap &amp; Repeat for years
Move away from home, fapping increases along with the porn
Girlfriend and I move in together a year before we get married
Notice that sex life isn't anything how I imaged it. Figured it would go from 1-2 a week when we lived apart to 4+ a week when together.
Ignore problem by fapping and porn
In my mid 20's; get marreid
After being married a year, I continue to try to turn marriage sex life into porn movie. Lots of wet eyed conversations about not being satisfied
After viewing only 1 video of ""Your Brain On Porn"", realize that the porn may be the issue…

So, that's the quick story to bring you up to speed. I've decided to join PornFree to be apart of a community along with giving my own advice and observations to those that may want it. I don't know if I have anything unique to add right now, but I feel that making my decision in a public place will mean something. At best, I'm also looking to get your advice and tips as well.

One of the hardest parts for me, is to image my sexual life without porn. Everything from saving the best images from other reddit groups to streaming videos from Plex has been a staple of my life since I was young. The reason that I now work with computers and have so many skills is because early on, I needed to figure out how to hide my web traffic before Incognito Mode was invented. Learning about cookings and history use Netscape started both my secret side and my more public ""family tech guy"" life. Honestly I haven't given this to much thought, and luckily, it doesn't scare me. With what I've been dealing with over the last 2 years, I feel anything is better than what I'd been doing in the past.

It really starts for me when my girlfriend (now wife) and I moved in together. We had been dating for a number of years before moving in together and porn was never really an issue. In showing off my best side, I never had it around nor would mention it. She knew I had it and used it, but I think, like many girls her age, she didn't know the true extent at which I would use it. Everything from fapping most night to watching porn on my 21"" desktop screen while playing Call of Duty on my 32"" TV, side by side. It became a buddy of sorts; something I could do it keep myself entertained and not bored. It sounds silly to say, but I know I could tell you almost every bit of porn I had and what was on each video, photo collection, or comic.

When we moved in together after becoming  engaged, several things happen. First, I notice that our sex life doesn't advance from just weekend sex that was the staple of college. I figure that with us being together so much now, I could expect 4+ nights a week to keep me satisfied.

In the past, and still today, I tend to be a very passive aggressive guy. I keep things to myself, hoping that things will get better if I let things slide. I'm a very optimistic person, so I figured things would settle down and ""the fun"" would begin. Well, it never happened and I continued to use fapping &amp; porn as a way to numb the feelings I was having. The more I felt ignored, the more I fapped and looked at porn. My fiancé talked to me a few times about how she felt that porn was something she didn't like, and she didn't want to see. She acknowledge that it was something I did, but didn't want to see herself. With her input, I become more secretive and started to resent how she treated me.

We get married, and once again, I feel the ""good times"" are finally here. I've been waiting for the sex life to explode. Yet, once again nothing changes. Over the course of the next year, the following pattern starts to repeat: I am upset that I'm not getting the attention I feel I deserve, I go more into porn and make passive aggressive moves for her to see my anger. I change my computer desktop or phone to a topless girl (or some bikini model). She gets upset, and asks that I change it. I ignore her request and pretend to be above it all. She's hurt, I'm hurt. Being a great couple in everything else we do, we come back together again till the process repeats every few months. Each time, I get more bold with trying to show my dissatisfaction with her. I spend many nights in our first year of marriage angry at her. (It is only later that I hear the phrase, ""Never go to bed angry"")

During our repeating pattern, we try to fix the issue several times. It come down to the idea that feel I'm not happy in bed because I'm not getting enough sex. We have long heart to heart conversations where I promise to hide the porn, she promises to have more sex. Nothing changes. We're still at about 1.5x a week on the sex, and usually only weekends. I think I can figure this out and invent a game for us to keep score of scoring. The idea was to move our sex life up to 3 times a week, usual this simple game, with incentives for her if she follows the rules. At the end of the 3 week ""game"", nothing changed much. I get throw out the game and ignore it by fapping and download another 20GB of new porn videos.

During this period, I start to get jumpy if I go more than 3 days without fapping. I actually knew when that 3rd day without fapping was, as all I could think about was fapping when I got home while making as much effort to view as much porn on my phone during the day. I view porn through the day to help calm me down and make me forget about not getting the sex I feel I need.

It only takes a week without sex for me to become passive aggressive with the wife. Once again, I keep quite hoping this will get better. At one point, it gets close to 21 days without sex for me to blow up at her. She says she didn't realize it and apologizes. It is at this point in our marriage that I start to look for ways to sabotage myself for getting sex. As our marriage moves past our first year and into the second, I start to feel empowered in a weird way about not getting sex. I feel the longer I have to wait for sex, the more I can hold over her head. Not in a way I mention it to her, more of a scorecard in my own head so I can justify being mad at her when I want to. Its an idea that she is getting worse and that by having less sex, I now have have proof i needed all along. In all the years leading up to our marriage, I only reject sex 1 time that I can remember. Since being married for over a year, I've done it maybe a handful of times.

With lots of changes in our life recently, it has made me think that this path that I'm headed down is doomed to fail. I had read several marriage books and other articles, but none addressed this aspect of my life. After reading an article about ""Your Brain on Porn"" and then viewing most of the YouTube videos from the series, it clicked. I decide to remove all my porn and stop myself from viewing it.

That was two weeks ago. I had never thought about fapping as being an issue as well, and I'm still on the fence if this is something I should be giving up as well. Maybe by fate, but once the porn dried up, so did my desire to fap. In the two weeks since getting rid of all the porn, I've only fapped once. Even then, I kinda cheated and read an erotic story as an aid.

My goal when I threw away my porn was to try living without porn to see how things would get better. I'm hoping that the sex life will become something that i look forward to. No longer do I want to look at the wife and hide how I'm feeling or think of a way to avoid sex with her. As for now, my only stated goal is to move away from porn and stop fapping as well. It hasn't been hard to stop the fap, as the impulse to look at porn while I'm bored at home is much greater.

That's is for now, I'll continue to share my journey along the way. Your input is always welcome.

It was. All of it was.

A couple of years back, and last year, I tried to give up porn for various different reasons before I knew about /r/pornfree or even /r/nofap. I think the longest attempt had been a month and a half. 

At the start of the year, I was in a very bad place, and my sudden shift in pornographic tastes suddenly snapped me out of something and I finally just asked ""What the fuck am I doing, there's no way this can be healthy for me!"" and some how I stumbled on /r/nofap and /r/pornfree. After watching the TedX talk and YBOP, a whole heap of problems made sense. Once I understood why I couldn't seem to orgasm with a partner, why I was so introverted, and where sooo much shame and self loathing was stemming from, quitting porn has been, so far, one of the easiest things I've given up. 

I have been battling depression for a really long time, and suddenly, a lot of problems relating to that god awful affliction made so much more sense to me. I can honestly say, I haven't felt that black dog's presence in my life at all in the last two months. That suits me, not looking at porn is a fuck load cheaper than psychologists are. 

So I can tell you all here, right now, that it is worth it. It won't solve every problem in your life, but it does make the world much easier to deal with. I love not having anything to hide any more. I love waking up in the morning and having nothing to feel ashamed of. More to the point I can feel myself healing, and I'm pretty sure my DE has gone away (that part of the program hasn't gone to the testers yet, though beta testing is close on the horizon). 

I'm actually at a point where I don't even think about porn, or have any desire to look at it. But I should disclose that I'm also doing /r/nofap which to me has been extremely challenging, but I feel has greatly helped in the rebooting process. For those of ya'll on the fence on NoFap, I suggest at least giving it a try, it really is an eye opener. 

For me, this is 60 days plus the term of my natural life. Looking back on my life, I can see the damage porn has done to me, or should I say, that I let it do to me. I have no need nor desire for it any more.

Also, and this was actually one of the reasons I tried to give up previously, no longer do I have to feel like a complete hypocrite for being a male feminist when the truth was I was fapping to sick shit most nights. Now, I feel I can truly put my money where my mouth is on certain issues I feel strongly about. 

Stay strong all. Ya'll are doing a good thing. If you're struggling, just keeping trying and don't give up. Like cigarettes, gaming, drugs, booze, gambling, anything else. Keep at it, soon it will click, and not doing it will be as easy as breathing. Just don't give up on yourself.

While I‘m writing this i‘ve been without PMO for exactly 10 days, 1 hour and 42 minutes.
The first seven days were much easier than I thought but today I had a really strong desire to go back to my favourite porn an get off on it. I reminded myself why I was doing the no PMO thing and decided to post my story here to help myself not to relapse.
I never considered myself to be porn addicted until I foudn r/pornfree which got me into thinking...
I started masturbation at the age of 12, when I found some old Playboy magazines, with 13 I recorded Porn of tv and with about 14 I started watching internetporn. At that time I needed only to think about how I will watch porn in the next few minutes to get hard. Now, at the age of 25 I need to while watching in order to get aroused. My tast in porn also changed a lot. It had to be extremer and new vids all the time. But not even that does the job anymore. The worst thing is how my sexual life sufferd from it.
I had my first girlfrind when I was 20. She was good looking and I liked her a lot. But i couldn‘t get hard when we tried to have sex. She left me 3 weeks later. My next girlfrind was one of the most beautiful females I ever saw but again took me very very long to get „him“ up. She left me 3 month later. My last girlfriend I had with 23. This was the worst ever. I took ages to get hard and when we finally had sex I came within a minute. Needless to say, that that relationship didn‘t last long an my selfconfidence was as low as it could get. All the time I was fapping to porn at least once a day. 
For about two weeks I have new girlfriend. We met in an online-Community (themed Music), live in different cities but want to meet soon. 
I thought back at my other relationships and was very afraid, that it would be just as the last times. So I googled my problem and found r/pornfree. Now that I now that porn is the problem I immediatly deleted all porn from my harddrives and didn‘t look at any sex-sites anymore.
I already feel a lot better now. Today I had the first morning-wood in years! 
I get aroused just by talking with my gf on phone about how when it comes to the topic sex. And I feel attracted to normal women again. As I said, right now I want my porn back, but when I see how much better I feel without it, I won‘t go back anymore! I want to hold a real woman not porn! Thank you all very much! You helped my a lot!",,False,,t5_2rglh,False,,month6,True,t3_17t2fs,http://www.reddit.com/r/pornfree/comments/17t2fs/pornfree_for_a_better_me_my_story/,

I didn't realise how bad this was until I stopped on January 21. I was trying to go at least a month without it, but realising slowly that the problem is a lot worse than just a hiatus. 

I have a cue. When I was a teenager living at home, I hardly got time alone, and it became something to look forward to. And now as an adult, this is just pathetic. Imagine if I spent those countless hours on something else - like reading or my guitar or going to the gym (or sleep!) - I'd be twice the man I am today. It's made me antisocial. It's damaged my health. It's sapped my motivation. And worst of all, I find it hard to enjoy simple things in life. I feel pathetic. I don't think there's any other word to describe it.

I'm trying to make it a month - one milestone at a time. I want to feel happiness and excitement from the little things in life. I'm not a slave to this manipulation of my impulses!

It's been five days. And I'm ranting because I'm frustrated as all hell. And even more frustrated that I'm having cravings in the first place. This is hard. It shouldn't be. I can do this. Fuck this shit!

People that are serious about keeping porn out of their lives, the ones who grew up with the high-speed hard-core from age 11 or 12, are in for a very long battle.

I've been feeling great lately. I'm 76 days porn free after two previous failed attempts of ~30 and ~45. I have more energy, more focus, I've gathered the will power to take on other weak points in my life: alcohol and lack of physical fitness. 

I started to think I was free of the temptation, that I would sail on to 360 days of pornfree and beyond. But yesterday I was blind sided unexpectedly. I was looking up a woman I thought was cute from a video I'd watched. First article about her that pops claims that she's done big time porn, and offers stills of non-sex scenes to verify her and then links to click to the vids. I couldn't believe how quickly I almost got sucked in: my mind went abuzz, my heart rate doubled. Only the weight of my accomplishments so far gave me the resolve to not click the link. 

Be careful out there. Don't believe your own hype. Don't believe you've got this thing beat 100%. You could run yourself into an ambush. If you get in a similar spot, quit the browser, snap the laptop shut, and go walk around outside til you've cooled it. Keep reminding yourself-- it's not worth it.

Throughout this time it's been particularly difficult since a break up, **a)** eventually pushed me over the edge to stop, and **b)** has been stressing me out a lot.

However, through this time I've actually surprised myself. Even through some of my lowest days, sure, I've thought about looking... but then I think about the end as well. I think about the guilt I would feel for that 10 minutes of PMO... it would be unbearable. Everything would be undone. *I can't do that to myself. I don't deserve it.*

Anyways, on to the main point of my post. I've noticed as I've abstained from pornography and fapping, my sensitivity has gone up substantially. For example, I've watched a TON of gory movies, viewed r/wtf up and down and the like with no disgust... but the other day I was watching Django Unchained and I found myself almost squirming at the amount of blood that was in the film. (I unsubbed from r/wtf weeks ago and it helps) There have been other instances where I have found that too... that what I once thought was okay, now bothers me.

I feel like it's an interesting side affect to abstaining. 

Perhaps it's because I am also religious... but I doubt it. Everyone has the light of Christ in them to decipher between good and evil.

Hang in there, it's only been 35 days for me... but this is the longest I've ever been and it gets better and better each day. I find myself having more free time and not worrying about the secret that used to be locked deep in my closet.

You can change the IP address written to another site if you wish not to be redirected to NoFap.

I believe it will work best with K9 installed, which will block any links I skipped or don't work and RES add-on to block all NSFW links on reddit.

Just a reminder, while the file is pretty complete, don't forget, if you want porn, you will find a way to get it easily - the internet is a huge place, this is not a save all miracle. You will need will power and firm on your goal to quit.

Seriously though ... this is just a rant and a self-Yeah to more than 7 weeks of a pornfree life! I am doing fine in general... finals are tomorrow and I will go to bed after this (CST). 

About two weeks ago I felt like it wasn't working out between a girl I was dating and I. So I told her we should cool things off before somebody got hurt. Which essentially would have happened because we had diverging ideas of our relationship and I wasn't really feeling ""it"". And no in case anyone wondered, we did not have sex since I was not going to take advantage of her in any way. So the ""break-up"" went well. She seemed to understand and we are still small talking every now and then.

So this is that. We've only been dating for 5 weeks. One of us found out that we were no match and everyone is fine. 
Until I meet this incredible girl in the study room.

She sat opposite of my friend and I. She smiled, laughed, flirted with a friend of hers. And I wouldn't really mind. I was contempt with where I was right now: Single, hard-working, free to do whatever I wanted to. But suddenly: Decollete. A pair of the finest fruit I have seen for a long time. I don't want to seem like a perv! Though one simply could not just NOT take a glimpse every now and then. It was so bad my friend started to complain to me about the obvious distraction so we went for a walk. 

The memory of this afternoon just flashed before my eyes and I was about to ""take action"" on it. I am partly disgusted with myself. Partly I pitty myself for I might have let go of someone because she didn't have exactly what I was looking for. She was certainly okay looking. But no more than average. And the fact that I now miss her a little because I saw a great pair of boobs does not really help.

The fact that I can quantify a persons appearance and not be satisfied with it, while her intellect and character were certainly appealing kind of crushes me right now. I don't know whether I give myself shit for a mental process everyone goes through while dating. Or rather something, which origins spring from porn; In the objectification of women.

Seriously this is the first time in 9 years I've actually decided and stuck to it. In the past I've always fallen on day 3-6. Not this time! One of the things I noticed past the 20 day mark was how seldom the urge comes on now. It still comes but it is weaker and so much easier to shoot down. 

I've always been a person with a very vivid imagination but the last 4-5 years I've noticed it slipping away and being replaced with a search for external stimulation. This last month it is back with a vengeance! Dreams are more vivid. I respond more to music etc. I have more ideas etc. It's like my brain was so preoccupied with the porn that now it is suddenly grasping for something else to do. It's awesome!

It has been 3 weeks without porn and I now know I am extremely addicted. After two weeks I thought this was going to be easier than I thought, but I couldn't have been more wrong. The past few days have been nothing but hell, filled with resisting temptation. I've had moments were I just wanted to give in. I am still going strong though and I hope to keep it up, although it's getting harder every day. I really hope this craving passes, because it's annoying and making me doubt why I am doing this.

Have I noticed any changes? No, not this week. I'm sure these three weeks have been too short to overcome my old habits, so I must go on and hopefully I'll notice improvement soon. I did however, create an account on www.chains.cc, to track my progress. Having a visual indicator (besides my own excel spreadsheet) really helps. There are also several groups on no-porn at this site where you can compare your own progress with others. I can really recommend this!

So, I'm sorry I can't give you a happy story filled with how my life has changed without porn in the past three weeks, because it hasn't yet and the cravings are bugging the crap out of me. I will keep going, I am not giving up now and hopefully, next week, there will be another update with more positive news.

Today marks the second week of being pornfree. I never thought I would make it this far, considering my previous lifestyle. I am proud of myself. but boy...is it hard. Every day again I am forcing myself not to visit those familiar sites I have come to love in the past couple of years. The more time passes, the more I ask myself, why the hell am I doing this. I then visit this subreddit or watch the YBOP series and immediately I am determined to finish this 90-day streak. I have noticed some slight improvements after being pornfree, for example women are starting to look better every single day. Simple pictures of a woman with some cleavage I encounter in a magazine for example, excite me more than ever before. Two weeks earlier, such a picture would have been considered too mild and uninteresting. My sexual dreams have not stopped yet, altough they have gotten less. Every now and then my brain will take advantage of my sleep and start firing images of naked women at me. When I wake up and remember my goals, I am in no way tempted to look up porn.

A few years ago I discovered my SO's porn collection because he left it open on his computer accidentally (I was not searching for it). After seeing tons of videos of orgies, videos that seemed to disrespect the women, or rape-ish videos, I got weirded out. I held my feelings in for awhile, not wanting to be ""nagging"", but finally asked him about it when I realized it was affecting my attraction for him and comfort in our sex life.

He immediately told me that he would stop watching porn. Looking back I probably should have seen that this could backfire but I believed him. He ended up watching porn again very soon afterwards and lied to me about it for months. I tried to be understanding, because I know it can be an addiction and also, he was doing it for me, not for himself. But he said he has always wanted to stop watching and this was just giving him the extra ""push"" he needed to stop watching.

Over the years this cycle keeps repeating. He says he won't watch it, doesn't watch it, and hasn't watched it in months. Then, I inevitably find out that he has been lying to my face about it and hiding it. He has had trouble getting it up from time to time due to porn use. He has gotten secret iPods and iPhones to do this without me knowing. At first I was just a little bothered by the porn. Now I am starting to feel genuinely betrayed. The lying is really bothering me.  He watches it whenever I am not home, I am pretty sure, but lies and says he doesn't.

It is causing a huge rift in our 5 year relationship. I feel like I can't trust anything he says anymore.

Pornfree, do you have any words of wisdom for me? Any perspective? He insists it isn't an addiction, but his actions and his words don't match up - which I think suggests otherwise. All I can think about during sex is his secret life and the videos he watches. I want to understand him and support him, but it feels like he is betraying me.

Sorry if this is the wrong place to post, but other subreddits have been REALLY critical of me for not liking porn. I've been called names on my main account and had my inbox flooded with angry (very angry) messages about how awful I am.

Also, I commend you guys for trying to give it up.  It shows a lot of character.

**EDIT:** Thanks so much to those who have commented!  I agree with all of you guys that I really can't expect him to change ""for me"" because it won't work. It's not a strong enough motivator to overcome his addiction, sadly. But after every thing that's happened, I do really feel sad when he watches it. So I'm kind of stuck about what to do. On the one hand, I want him to know that it bothers me (to be honest with him) - on the other hand, I don't want him to feel like he's only making the change for me. So should I keep my feelings about it to myself?  For those who suggested different videos, that's a great idea, but I've already tried showing him some things like that. He says he knows that it has harmful consequences but he still wants to watch it anyway... is there no hope?

So, yeah, I still have a hosts file that redirects from porn sites to motivational stuff. But I uninstalled K9. And I switched from OpenDNS back to my local DNS server. It'd be trivial to get porn except for one thing: A switch seems to have been flipped in my psyche. I just don't want it anymore. There is no temptation, no fighting urges, etc. I waved the white flag and said enough. The concept of enough is enormously empowering. Also, I am truly and profoundly grateful for this change. If it is not permanent, then so be it. But it's been seven days since my last reset, and five of them have been truly pornfree, i.e. free from the desire for porn.

What happened? I mean, I've been fighting this thing for six years! Back in 2006 I first realized I had a porn addiction. I couldn't shake it. I just would try to stonewall it and BAM I'd be back to my favorite sites, surfing one-handed. Before that it was rented DVDs, VHSs, magazines, whatever. 

So I read a couple of books - Out Of The Fog, Pure Desire - but found no help there. Read about Buddhism but didn't really ""get"" it. So I've been struggling on and off for the past six years to break the porn habit.

Yet, a couple of days after my last binge, when I should have been feeling the desire start to build (it's been like clockwork: one day after a reset I'm not really tempted. Two days after I'm tempted but stay strong. Three days after I really am super-tempted and sometimes give in but mostly gut it out. Fourth day is always the worst and I would almost always give in. Day after day, worse and worse. 

SAA helped out quite a bit. It was the first time I've been able to tell my story to a roomful of people. Wept like an infant during parts of it. It was cathartic. But a schedule conflict has kept me away from meetings for over three months. So I don't think it's solely due to SAA.

The SAA book helped (the green one, it's on amazon). So did The Twelve Step Buddhist. But, again, I don't think they were the final triggers.

To the best of my knowledge here are the things that I think may have finally shot me up and out of the hole.

**No shame, no blame**
""Examining ourselves and our addiction to porn may bring feelings of self-criticism— even shame—to the surface. Here’s a way to work through those gently, a valuable exercise that people use to help them thoroughly “change their minds” and learn to think in new ways. Some people call it by its Sanskrit name, mantra, but it’s really any simple word or phrase that embodies a particular attitude or attribute you want to focus on. A mantra is something that allows you to steer your mind away from danger and toward a clear, open horizon. A useful mantra for us is ""No shame, no blame.""

(OPs note: I also now use the word ""responsibility"". As in ""What's my current responsibility to myself, to my life?"")

**Recrimination vs discrimination**
In choosing to change unwanted behavior, there is a difference between recrimination and discrimination. Recrimination is about shame and blame, good and evil, while discrimination sorts out the true from the false. Sinking into blame and shame slows your progress toward freedom. Recrimination immobilizes, demoralizes and distracts you. Discrimination, however, simply shines a bright light on potential pitfalls so that you can skirt them.

You may stumble repeatedly over the desire to blame yourself (or other people) based on what you learn. At those times, remember discrimination and remember the mantra: No shame, no blame. As a case in point, the hours you’ve spent on porn during your life represent just a number, not your number (OP's note: that time is gone, it's past, it's over). That figure is neither too much nor too little. It does not prove your worth or your unworthiness; it is not justification neither for despair because the time is gone, nor gloating because other people have ""worse"" addictions.

**Life Energy**
Viewing porn is something we choose to trade our life energy for. 
Repeat this because you may have missed its full significance: 
*PMO is something we choose to trade our life energy for.*

Our life energy is our allotment of time here on earth, the hours of precious life available to us. When we PMO we are trading our life energy for hollow and momentary pleasure - hours spent viewing and masturbating for a few seconds of orgasm. This truth, while simple, is profound. 

This definition of time spent on porn gives us significant information. Our life energy is more real in our actual experience than porn. So, while porn has no intrinsic reality, our life energy does—at least to us. It’s tangible, and it’s finite. Life energy is all we have. It is precious because it is limited and irretrievable and because our choices about how we use it express the meaning and purpose of our time here on Earth.""

**TWO**

**Confidence and Self-esteem meditation**
During the same time frame I was reading the above, in fact the same afternoon, I took a break from reading, lay down and closed my eyes, and listened and truly practiced the following guided meditation:
[Confidence and Self Esteem Meditation](http://thereisaway.podbean.com/mf/web/eybbh/confidence.mp3)
This is the web site I got it from: http://www.confidence.org.au/
The speaker's voices are somewhat accented, at least to my ear, so I missed words here and there. YMMV. Also, I didn't write, I just listened.

**THREE**

**The origin of suffering is attachment.**
Even though I didn't ""Get""  Buddhism, some of the points have seeped into my consciousness. The one I that I think applies to my liberation is understanding a little bit of the Buddhist concept of attachment. The second of the Four Noble Truths reads ""The origin of suffering is attachment.""

&gt;The origin of suffering is attachment to transient things and the ignorance thereof. Transient things do not only include the physical objects that surround us, but also ideas, and -in a greater sense- all objects of our perception. Ignorance is the lack of understanding of how our mind is attached to impermanent things. The reasons for suffering are desire, passion, ardour, pursuit of wealth and prestige, striving for fame and popularity, or in short: craving and clinging. Because the objects of our attachment are transient, their loss is inevitable, thus suffering will necessarily follow. Objects of attachment also include the idea of a ""self"" which is a delusion, because there is no abiding self. What we call ""self"" is just an imagined entity, and we are merely a part of the ceaseless becoming of the universe.

[More information on the Four Noble Truths](http://www.thebigview.com/buddhism/fourtruths.html).

**Responsibility**
This isn't one of the things that flipped the switch off of porn. It's a result I think of the above concepts and ideas. I'm shouldering my responsibility to myself, and to my Self. It feels very good. 

Be well.

This week has been one of the most stressful for me, I haven't exercised nor slept that well let alone eat a healthy diet or take my supplements.  However, I did stop looking at porn.

Like a lot of you, I found that porn was having an incredibly powerful (and damaging) effect on my sex life. You know the list: difficulty with performance, inability to ""finish"", thinking about porn even while *having sex*, etc. 

One particular low point stands out: I met a girl online who was looking for a casual afternoon hookup. She had a great pic, and was even more attractive in person. She was exactly the kind of girl that porn trains you to crave, except she was *real*. 

And you know the rest. 

I couldn't. I tried every perverted, arousing thought imaginable, and I still couldn't. Couldn't even start, much less finish. But...after I finally left, horrified and embarrassed, I went straight home and ""performed"" perfectly. To porn. As long as I live, I will hate myself for that missed opportunity.

**But the good news:** a couple of nights ago (and exactly three weeks after I swore off porn), something great happened. I was with a girl, and  instead of relying on ""porn memories"" to become/stay aroused, I realized that I was actually *in the moment*. I was thinking about, and being aroused by, the actual, real girl who was there. And that's the way our brains are *supposed* to work. It's not that we shouldn't get aroused by porn...it's that we should *also* get aroused by a real woman, and when that stops happening, there is definitely trouble.

Something that most people take for granted (normal sexual arousal) was even more pleasurable, because it meant that porn's smothering, suffocating effects might finally be in the rearview mirror...and getting smaller.

My name is NotNowNotEver and I'm a Porn Addict.

I joined ship on /r/nofap in its first week, almost a year ago, and despite that, the longest streak I've ever had is 21 days.  I'm an addict through and through.  

Since January, I went through a lot of tough shit, partially related to my PMO addiction and ended up in therapy.  As a recommendation of my therapist I joined [SAA](http://saa-recovery.org/) and got a sponsor.  Even then, with using K9, I found ways to get porn and go on binges of really disgusting vile shit, Getting worse each time too.  I found myself surfing prostitution &amp; anonymous sex pages, not really with any intention of soliciting, but to still get that hit, ya know?  Needless to say, I'm an addict and I'm in a bad way

After talking it over with my sponsor, I've decided that going truly celibate on nofap &amp; noporn + other risky behaviors is just unattainable.  I'm allowing myself masturbation for now, and only a few times a week before bed or in the shower, and only my imagination.  This is to try and wean myself off the hard shit into healthy sexuality.  Its been a week and I'm feeling good about it.  All of it has ben fixated on a girl who shares affection with me but lives a long distance away.  She knows of all my problems and is really appreciating my honesty, and it feels REALLY good.

Maybe I'll hop back on the /r/nofap train eventually, but for now, pornfree is what I'm trying to be.

Wake up early to get on the computer and have time with my porn.  For me the progression has not been to increasingly violent or disturbing porn but to increasingly exhibitionist porn -- which has now bled into my own life and exhibitionist compulsions.  I can't even be in a car by myself without taking ""it"" out, thrilling in the sensation of being so near to people who are unaware.  I always keep it out of direct sight ... cover up at red lights or 2 lane roads, etc. ... strangely I have these exhibitionist tendencies but I would be mortified if anyone actually saw me.  Most recently I have found some places to hike where there are seldom any other people around, and I have dared to go completely nude, leaving my clothes behind and thrilling in how far away I dare to get from the refuge of my clothes.  Always ending the experiment with frantic fapping under the sun.  I know the repercussions of being seen could ruin my life and marriage.  And I know it all stems from the imagery I am drawn to in online porn: Met Art and Femjoy models who romp through forests and beaches and towns totally nude.  (I envy that it's so much more ""accepted"" for women to be seen nude ... a nude woman is sexy, but a nude man is at best a pervert, and at worst a threat.  But I digress.)

I just deleted my entire collection of 1000+ carefully selected images of women in various states of exhibitionism, and I am beginning the journey of quitting this risky behavior, starting with the risky masturbating in front of a computer with my wife sleeping just down the hall.  Of course my story is similar to others I've read here where sex with my wife is concerned: I have little desire for sex (we're down to 1 or 2 times a month) and when we do I have an increasing likelihood of being unable to maintain long enough to orgasm.

I want to do this for my own safety (from being arrested and jailed), for the safety of my marriage (which would almost certainly crumble if she even knew, not to mention if I were ever arrested), for the stability of my marriage (in being able to better satisfy my wife sexually), and for my own well being (in having some self respect and feeling in control of my life, clarity of thought, and a more realistic view of sexuality in general).

Developing empathy will help you recover faster. Ask your SO how your habit makes them feel. Really ask and be prepared for a difficult answer. Learn how they feel unloved, unattractive, and sometimes even grossed out. 

Embrace every ounce of the suffering you've caused and grow from it. Learn to bring love instead of reject it. Learn to see the world through someone else's eyes and stop being a selfish dick. 

Learn to respect and honor your sex. It's powerful - and that's science! If you believe anything about Darwinian Evolution you have to agree that sex is powerful. So stop playing with fire and use your SO's pain as motivation to be the man you want to be. Listen to them and you will be a better lover, communicator, and human being.

It's probably been about a year now since I've started my pornfree journey, and it certainly has provided an interesting view into who I really am. For all the grief and suffering I've endured I feel like I've learned so much. 

I just recently ended a week and a half long binge that had left me feeling at one of my lowest since I began this challenge last year. For the last eight or so years I used porn as an escape from my own inner demons, as well as from the day to day stresses I would rather hold onto than deal with. Like so many others it started out pretty tame, theme-wise at least, but my tastes soon began to delve much deeper. From the soft-core vanilla to urolagnia and eventually transgender and the like, it really was amazing how I could transition to things I was once revolted to. Not only was it just exploring deeper, it became a necessity in order to even get off. Thinking back I laugh at how ""normal"" porn had become so uninteresting that I literally had trouble keeping my eyes open late at night while watching it. However, some of the things I watched have really left me feeling shitty afterwards, and have even caused me to question my own sexuality at times.

It had really crippled what little self-esteem I had. I withdrew from friends and family and didn't even like going outside as I felt people could see how fucked up I was. I couldn't talk to anyone, much less girls. Who would want to be with a freak like me? Ironically it just led to more porn in order to escape and feel better for a short time. You can see how it becomes a never-ending cycle.

I eventually reached a point during my first year of college where I had finally had enough and was ready to admit I had a problem. I was scary as hell, but I knew I had to do something. I still remember the night I was with my two close friends having dinner when I told them my problem. I eventually told my parents as well and everyone was incredibly supportive. Over the last year I have been working hard, not only to remove porn from my life, but to improve myself in general. Things like meeting with a therapist to help work through my struggles to just trying to get more active. The times where I am able to keep away from porn are some of the best days I have had in a long time. Just going out for a bike ride in the early morning or evening is an incredible experience. The small things like feeling the cool breeze in my face or watching the colors dance in the sky as the sun sets just make me feel so good inside. I feel so much more alive and at peace with everything. Social interaction comes much more naturally and I feel in a much better mood all the time. It's those feelings and experiences that help me get back up when I fall. It's what gives me the strength to continue to fight for my life back. I don't want to lose that again, not after seeing how amazing truly living can be!

Anyways, I just had a bit floating around and wanted to share. I'd like to thank everyone here for their support and for continuing to be an inspiration.

First of all, let me provide a brief history of myself. Four years ago, while under the influence of alcohol and cocaine, I was attempting to run across the street in the middle of the night, when I was struck by a car, and was then in a coma for around a week. That was at 18.

Much has changed as a result of the accident (loss of smell, numbness in half of body, loss of memory capabilities), and I was warned that brain injured persons were likely to fall into addictive ways. In retrospect, I most likely had a problem with drugs and alcohol before my accident, but it wasn't until I got fired from work one year later at 19 years of age (for being drunk), and kicked out of my school (I researched at the school), that I realized I had a problem. To the day (I'm almost 23), I have not drank or drugged, making me around 3 and a half years clean and sober.

WHAT DOES THIS HAVE TO DO WITH PORNOGRAPHY?

In rehab, I was told that I was ""switching seats on the titanic"" if I had picked up another addiction. Back then I probably thought I was doing the right thing if I was not going to the casino with my friends to stay in and watch porn. Oops.

Qualifying myself to belong here:

+I have over 500 gb or pornography on my computer, that I am seriously contemplating deleting.

+I have around 200 friends on facebook, but I have more pornstars in my well maintained library on a hard drive.

+I stumbled upon this reddit from googling ""porn passwords"", and thought this reddit was called ""freeporn""

I am done with pornography. I want all those hours back in my day so I can finish my masters thesis in a few more MONTHS not a few more YEARS, I want to be able to achieve orgasm with my girlfriend (and hopefully one day future wife) that I am amazingly attracted to, I want to stop feeling shameful, I am done with pornography.

Is it because I'm afraid of losing her? Again, that's a good reason but not good enough to stop.

Is it because I don't want to hurt myself anymore? I don't think so, I'm very concerned with hurting other's yet am extraordinarily casual about self-harm.

Is it because I know it's not healthy? I do know that porn has done nothing for me except tear me down, but for some reason I just don't care.

Is it because I'm afraid of what others will think of me? Definitely not, I'm one hell of a liar and even if they knew I wouldn't stop, I'd just lie harder.

Is it because I'm missing something in my life? I don't think so, at least I'm not really sure what that something would be. Happiness? Respect? Affection? Attention? I receive ample amounts of these from those that love me, so why stop?

Is it because I'm tired of wasting my life staring at pixels of women who don't exist? Not at all, I could do it for days.

Is it because it I am a lesser person for it? I don't think so, maybe because I don't know how great of a person I could be.

Is it because I want to be stronger? I do want to be stronger, but not as much as I want to keep watching porn. 

So why *do* I want to stop?

**I want to stop because I don't want to stop.**

Porn has taken such a tight hold over my life that I am imprisoned in the worst type of confinement, the kind I put upon myself. I can feel the chains holding me down, but I don't want to take them off, I just want to make them tighter and tighter. I turn to porn because there are so many areas in my life I feel I have no control over, and I feel that this self-imprisonment in this cheap, shallow addiction gives me control. The truth is that I am a slave to my own vain attempts to submit my dominance over my life. I tell myself that I watch porn because it is something that I have freedom over, when in truth porn is the shackles that bind me to the wall. While they are on I will *never* grow, while they are on I will *never* aspire to more than what I am, and while they are on I will *never* respect myself.

I want to stop wanting porn so that I can become the man I am not. I want to stop watching porn because I want to discover what it is like to be a man of integrity, of character, the kind of man that leaves a legacy worthy of emulating. I want to be happy being the person I am, god damn it. I want to be free of this stupid addiction which holds me back from becoming who I could be. I want to be free from these chains I put on myself, chains that I haven't taken off because I want them tighter. I have spent so long convincing myself that without my chains I would wither away into nothingness, forgetting that there was a time I could walk the halls of my own life without a desire to be held back.

Porn has done nothing for me, it is time to move away from it, time to unshackle myself from these unlocked bindings I have never taken off.

I **want** to stop wanting this poison.

I **want** to be a better man.

I **want** my life back.

I've definitely perused some arousing images during that time -- stuff on imgur, huffington post, searching for pictures of attractive actresses, etc. -- but I hadn't actually been getting into porn, hadn't been spending TIME looking for this stuff, so I'd been doing really well.

Yesterday, I started doing Bing searches with safesearch on (because Google's safesearch is stricter, which is an obvious red flag for being pornfree) of lots of stuff... I decided to reset my badge when I started typing in the names of porn actresses that I remember. While I was hoping to not see any actual porn, of course, Bing's filter isn't great, so I saw some. I think I would reset my badge even if I hadn't because, duh, I am still looking at images of those women for my own sexual pleasure.

I'm proud of myself for not going down that rabbit hole; it is the months of being pornfree that have given my the mental fortitude to not actually go back into it and really relapse hard. So, I'm resetting my badge to keep myself honest, not because I had a full PMO-type relapse. 

This is what progress looks like, y'all! Everyone will be fine.

Fuck, though, I have to be sure to not use my badge reset as an excuse to actually PMO. Luckily, I am busy as hell these days, so it's not terribly likely.

My story might be a little different from a lot of people who come here. I'm middle aged. I was into my twenties before I got cable internet. Before that, porn was either in a magazine, on a vhs tape, or if you were lucky, downloaded from usenet on a 14.4kbps modem. Nobody had huge GB of porn archives, and there were no browsers, let alone tabbed browsers you could fill with tabs and tabs of porn.

So I never had the issues that people here had. No ED. No escalating porn interests. No porn addiction induced social anxiety. I've had a ton of relationships, some successful, some not so much, but porn hasn't really gotten in the way of any of them.

But I've still given pornfree a try.  Mostly because I was curious about what effect porn has had on me. I used to get off to porn on a nightly basis. I used to edge a lot. Sometimes it would interfere, but mostly it didn't. I never gave it much thought until I found YBOP.

I could have gone my whole life without questioning it, and just continued like I was.  I probably would have had a relatively healthy life. But I gave it a try, and even though I've never made it the full 90 days, I've learned one invaluable thing:

PMO every night before bed isn't healthy.  Trying to find that ""perfect scene"" isn't healthy.  Having a huge porn archive isn't healthy.  Remember when people used to have one or two magazines or videos?  And only seriously dirty bastards had a garage full of porno?  Well, now you can have that garage on an external and nobody knows or thinks it's crazy.

So now I try and abstain. Sometimes I'm successful, sometimes I'm not. But I've completely broken out of it as routine, and I don't want to ever go back.  I feel like I have the sex drive I haven't had since I was a teenager, and I didn't think that was even possible at my age.  It's a great feeling.

So this is a message for people who PMO regularly, but don't think the problems people in /r/pornfree have apply to them: Try it anyways.

**My experience:**
I browse this subreddit regularly. If I hadn't found /r/nofap and /r/pornfree, I never would have learned that my SO had a problem with PMO. 

After I found these subreddits, I told my SO how cool I thought they are because of how strong you guys and gals are. You are building a really awesome support group where you felt comfortable enough to share your experiences, and learn and grow from those experiences. 

When I told him about them, he acted very awkward, and I feared that he was hiding something from me. 

It turns out that I was right.

He had a problem with PMO before we got together which he shared with me openly. He had a very very difficult childhood, and used PMO as an outlet. After we got together, his addiction stopped. As far as I knew, he wasn't doing anything like that. 
He told me that he had gotten over his addiction, and I trusted him and believed him. 

Moving forward, we had a lot of stress in our life. It triggered him to secretly begin PMO again. It went on for over a year and a half, and I had no knowledge of it. 

He thought that he could just stop, and he couldn't. 
He fantasized about getting help from me, but he was afraid of what I would think, what I would do, and that I would leave him.

When I got suspicious of his actions, I asked this community for advice. I got help on how to handle the situation, and I educated myself on why he would begin PMO again. We talked, and I asked enough questions over time for him to admit to me that he had masturbated and watched porn, and had been doing it for months. 

I was so hurt. NOT at the fact that he had masturbated, but at the fact that he lied to me for so long because of his shame; the fact that he thought that bottling everything up was so much better than sharing his pain with me. I felt like I had to force a confession out of him instead of him being open with me about it.

I am his partner. I am here to help him. 
I am not here to judge him. 
I want to help.

I won't lie, there were a lot of tears after his confession. There was a lot of pain, and a loss of trust. However, the trust can be earned back and a lot of respect has already been gained. I know he wasn't trying to hurt me, and that he was trying to protect me by hiding it. However, hiding it just made the situation worse.

My SO has become very open about his PMO addiction, and our relationship is really growing because of it. 

His energy level is incredible because he is no longer suppressing all of this guilt inside of him. He is finding other outlets to release stress with. 

I am INCREDIBLY PROUD of him for telling me that he had a problem, for doing this challenge, and helping us both have better self-control.

**Basically, I want to give you very simple, yet complicated advice:**
You don't need to hide this from your loved ones. 
This is an addiction, and it is so important that you ask for help.
Guilt is normal, and part of the healing process. Admit to your shame, and grow from it.

I know many of you are afraid to get your SO, friends, or family involved because you are afraid of being judged, but they will show their true colors when you ask for help. What you need in your lives now are positive people with supportive attitudes that want you to get through this. I may not be a fapstronaut, but I have struggled with addiction in my life also. If I hadn't gotten the support I knew I really needed, I wouldn't be where I am today.

You can do this. You can. Tell someone involved in your life that you are doing this, and that you need their support.


**If you are really afraid of what your SO would think:**
Show your SO this subreddit, and your brain on porn. Help them see that it isn't their fault, and that your addiction isn't because you don't find them attractive. Listen to their concerns, and understand their perspective. 
As a woman (I don't mean to generalize women...), I see the women in porn as real people. If you took them out of the screen and put them in your bedroom, the situation would change dramatically. From a female partner perspective, watching porn is sort of like infidelity. 
I understand the state of mind of a PMO addict now, but I wouldn't if I hadn't watched YBOP videos. Other than overcoming the lies, understanding that you are watching porn because of an addiction and not because you don't find your SO attractive *will be* the hardest thing for your SO. 

Well that's about it. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns. I want to help you all in any way that I can. I understand that it isn't easy to just tell someone you love about this.

Thank you for your advice in the past, and I hope that this will inspire you to get the close support that you need. Thank you guys, and stay strong!",,False,,t5_2rglh,False,,,True,t3_1ikt26,http://www.reddit.com/r/pornfree/comments/1ikt26/are_you_really_getting_the_support_you_need_xpost/,

I came across a post from a girl on the relationships subreddit talking about how torn up she was after finding porn on her bf's phone.  Many commenters are being extremely dismissive of her hurt feelings and telling her she's the one with problems (being insecure/ having trust issues/ being a snoop or possessive). 

I replied and told her I didn't think she was wrong at all for feeling hurt, and recommended some literature on porn addition and the impact of porn on partners.  My comment got down voted really quickly, and I'm hoping that some of you can reach out to her so that she can at least hear both sides of the argument.

Firstly I should say I'm not going for the full nofap, at least not yet. But I do want to eliminate porn from my life. I guess I have a similar story to most - started looking at porn at school around 13/14 (am in my 30s so it was all magazines then!) but the Internet has just made it too easy to get hold of and fap to porn. I'm not into anything I would consider unusual but I enjoy the rush of looking for it and then fapping. Afterwards I always feel rubbish. I'm not a consistent user - I can go with 3 or 4 days of not looking but then it just gets me. I usually also end up on cam sites showing off. Not good.

So, I'm going to give it a go. Personally, and I know some will disagree, I can't see the harm in masturbating a few times a week if no porn is involved so I'm comfortable with that. I just need to kick the porn habit as it takes up too much time for something which is pointless. I've tried strategies in the past which have been semi-succesful (such as if I'm home alone and with a chance of using porn I'll just fap as soon as I can thus removing the need for porn) but finding this forum is great as I feel I can talk to others with this issue.

I would say meditation, the deliberate creation of a focused mind for 20 minutes a day, is a huge component to this addiction recovery. The major theory behind it is to separate and grow space between thoughts and actions. You have the thought feeling or craving, and you have a choice to act upon them or not. Meditation is perfect at giving you a ""buffer"" or ""space"" to chose which action to take in the moment you have the feeling, craving, or thought. The healthier, more rational and compassionate action, or the more self destructive and immediately gratifying one, or simple chose to do nothing at all and relax. So the name of the game is to become master of your actions, not necessarily your thoughts or cravings. Although the thoughts and cravings may slowly loose their intensity over time.

It was just a stash of dirty mags that my brother and I found while dumpster diving. Ironic really, that was the pre-digital version of r/pornfree. Throughout my teenage years I had a typical relationship with porn that most young guys do. Meaning, It was a regular part of my life.  Coming from a religious background, it probably had more of a forbidden fruit aspect than your regular teen in retrospect. At 17 I fell for my wife to be in a classical high school sweet heart scenario. She was from a religious background too, and I suddenly had more of a compunction to give up porn, so I did for over a year.  Wham, the porn came back. This time I had real guilt over it. I knew that my girlfriend(eventual wife) would be deeply hurt by it so I did what any weak minded fool would do: I hid it and kept on doing it. It was a double life of sorts.  On one hand, I was saving sex for marriage. In the other hand(right) I was watching porn regularly. 

At age 21 I got married. I figured the porn thing would be over then because I could finally have sex!  Sure it died down for 6 months or so, then it reared it's ugly head. I fessed up to my wife, and crushed her emotionally. She came from a sheltered background so you can imagine the shock. Thus started a cycle of being porn free for months at a time then relapsing for months. I would fess up again and restart. This has lasted 9 years. During the relapses I would become nasty, and quick to fight with my wife. Really, it was guilt eating at me. 

My wife is an amazing woman and amazing mother to our children. She turns heads all the time when we go out. We have a great sex life that can vary from romantic to kinky. Psycho-sexually my porn habit has been very difficult for her. It effects her self confidence, and sexual expression. 

Today I am going to try something different. I'm going to stop trying to rely on me to kick the habit and join the r/pornfee team.

I'm sick of my porn habit, join r/pornfree",,False,,t5_2rglh,False,,month2,True,t3_1g1wnh,http://www.reddit.com/r/pornfree/comments/1g1wnh/day_1/,

Porn is without a doubt something that I need to quit before it wrecks me even more. I was first introduced to it at the very young age of 5 but I didn't really start getting into it til I was 11 with the Victoria's Secrets catalogs. This, coupled with my social anxiety (I'm not so anxious now compared to then but my social still needs work), has wrecked me. Then I found the joys of writing at 15 which led to writing my own sorts of erotica down the road. There's just so much to go through but the main culprit are my fantasies. Porn has ruined them so much beyond my 11-year-old VS fantasies. I'm here to press that reset button and get the re-conditioning going.

This is more of a, ""Sign here and you'll have a contract that if you break it, the only one who will hurt is you.""

This is for my self-image. Porn had always been that mechanism for me to get me out of my funk but I don't want that anymore. While I am doing this in order to settle down with a great woman one day, I am also doing this to better myself. To no longer waste the precious time I have now and to put it to good use. 

I'm doing /r/nofap too in conjunction with this. I know the change won't happen with the passage of time but with how I manage and utilize it. I won't allow myself to feel like I have to beat myself to feel good. I'll feel good by doing the things I expect myself to do.

Today I am married, almost 30, with a young child. My wife knows I have a porn problem, although not in the detail I'm about to go into here. She has forgiven me over and over again.

I remember getting into masturbation at a fairly young age (11 or 12). That part is not too unusual. I started finding images on the computer. At the time when dial-up was the norm, I used DOS text-only internet programs to download images and view them in image viewers. It is kind of funny looking back, how archaic and slow-paced it was. Later I would print out erotic stories and images in black and white and stashed them.

A few years later, late in high school, by the time I had a newer computer I would spend all night locked in my room surfing porn. It was a massive time waster at this point.

When I was 15 I had a lovely and beautiful 16yo girlfriend. She did some modeling and was very slim and youthful looking even for 16. I think these first sexual experiences imprinted on me, because as I've gotten older, although I'm thoroughly attracted to women my own age, I find myself seeking out images of very young women. I look at these girls and imagine things similar to when my first GF and I were experimenting together.

Objectively, I don't think there's anything unusual about a man finding naked teenagers stimulating. However, as it usually is with stimulus you have to push the boundary a little bit more each time to get a rush.

I think that this has warped my sexuality over time. I find that even though I'm highly attracted to women my own age, my default go-to thing is jailbait girls. It's like the high fructose corn syrup of erotica. It's junk food for your libido, even more than normal porn.

This has taken me to places I really *really* do not want to go, and led to paranoia and panic about having my door busted in one morning and being hauled off in a van.

I wish I could unsee the things I've seen, and take back the time I've wasted.

So that brings me to today. I keep saying that I just need to quit, but my wife pointed out that I've never tried to find real support from anywhere. So here I am, trying to do that. We'll see how that goes.

From ""innocent"" naturism we branched off into erotic nudity. I mean, it's still the geographer at play.

Then real sex. Hmm, more enticing.

I was hooked.

But then gradually hi-speed came in. I recall leaching off of wifi to stream one of my first videos. Needless to say, the next day they put a password.

Soon I was into videos. Damn, videos?!? That's so fucking exciting! 

Videos to more videos. And this has me thinking today, *how will the porn of the future look like* ? 

It will be even more ridiculous. We already see ideas like 3D and more physical UI coming into play. It's scary, what if you might use technology to simulate *real* sex. Like sex robots?!? 

Will we have zombies who renounce all social interaction just to live with their machines? Pale shrimp-like people perpetually glued  to their do-everything computers?

It just makes me feel more resolved to hang in this , just even *one more day*

First a bit about myself - I'm a 40-something who's been married about 10 years (happily) with a young daughter.  I've used pornography 3-7 days/week for most of my life since puberty.  I never really considered it wrong, and while I might have had a mild addiction, I never got to the point where I would try to look at increasingly shocking stuff.  I guess I'm just squeemish and my gross-out factor cut in before I could look at stuff that was too out there.

After I got married, my wife made it clear she didn't approve of porn and thought it a serious infringement on our marriage.  I disagreed but told her I'd stop.  She would catch things on my PC from time to time and I'd make excuses which she seemed to accept but I don't know how much she believed me, and occasionally I would admit to doing it but that I was trying not to.  A particular difficulty for me here was that she is not very interested in sex, and so we can go two or three months without any sexual activity.  I convinced myself that this alone was a justification for getting my urges out in another way.  I would be happy to have no contact with porn, I said to myself, if she would have sex with me on a more regular basis.

While I do think that porn can desensitize you and rewire your brain in negative ways, and that of course is bad enough, there's another aspect of porn that I don't see commented upon here which I alluded to in the beginning of my post, and that is of the people in these movies or photos that you download. Perhaps there are some who do it because it is simply fun and they can disassociate the sex they have on camera completely from the intimate act they have with their SO.  I suppose some people simply don't have the wiring to view sex as anything but an athletic practice with a bit of a dopamine hit (over and above a normal athletic practice!).  But I think that probably there's a majority of people in the porn industry who are doing it to do additiction to drugs, abusive relationships, abusive childhoods, or even being coaxed into the industry by sex trafficers.  I've heard of such people luring 17-year-old girls from rural towns in the US, and that's in the US, where there are lots of laws and oversites about such stuff.  What about countries that are still really weak in terms of law and order and governence, not to mention sexual attitudes that are a bit more ""open"" than ours in this country?  

In other words, my sense is that there's a very good chance that the people (mostly women) that you are watching in a video is someone who is doing this not in a completely independent way, something they chose to do because it suits them and something that they would do if they didn't have to because it provides income that they can't get elsewhere.  And that's putting it somewhat lightly, as there are probably many who are doing it under duress, perhaps even sex slaves, who knows!

Having a young daughter certainly drives this home in a lot of ways, but even if I didn't have her, I've slowly come to understand that while I never would actually pay for porn (and thus monetarily support and help continue the porn industry), the fact that I still watched it I'm sure was still contributing.  Clicks mean some kind of revenue I'm sure, and just the fact that I was getting off, so to speak, on another human being's misfortune (not in all cases, but probably at least a good number if not most), is just as compelling a reason for me to stop as is for my own benefit or that of my relationship with my wife.

So yesterday I had the biggest relapse ever. I have been regularly consuming internet porn since I was sixteen, but only recently did I realize that it was becoming a huge time consumer and that it was troubling my social relationships and maybe even my sex life. So I've tried to quit a few times, with no real success (a few months ago I managed to stay off xxx material for about two weeks and I felt great... but then, what do you know, I relapsed!). I was very happy when I found out about this subreddit because I thought it would give me the support needed to abstain myself from PMO, but, as I proved out yesterday, it was not enough. Yesterday was a very black day for me (skipped work, consumed a heavy dose of junkfood, smoked weed like there's no tomorrow, and PMOd all day long... it was shit!) and now I'm just trying to get up and move on, be a better person. So I've decided to stop fap, PMO and weed altogether for a few days. 

Feeling very frail right now. I gotta go make amends with the real world now, fix what broke yesterday if you know what I mean. Thank you all for your support.

I try to remember this saying when I think about why I'm staying porn free. Some days, especially slow days at work, I get back into the old way of thinking and look forward to going home to browse videos till the wife gets home. Then I remember what I'm trying to accomplish for myself and I change my focus.


Seems the most posts I hear on here about about guys relapsing and asking for advice. I figured talking about the progress would be more useful to facilitate more conversations I'm looking to have here. What are you goals? Why are you choosing to go PornFree? Seems like many people here use it as a tool to get out and start living the life they've always wanted. I've read many stories about being able to talk to women / girls that would never have happened before. 


Being scared to talk to women gets back at the idea that porn is the mental hunger that can't be filled. From my experience, a women will never be what you want her to be in regards to being your sex slave. Maybe there are 3 women out there that are like that, but for the audience here, and the girls I recommend you be with, that's not what you want. Easy girls make great fantasies, but horrible girlfriends and even worse wires. 


Looking back, I can see how porn changed how I acted around my wife. When things we're not going the way I thought they should in our marriage, I kept trying to turn our sex life into porn. I didn't occur to me at the time that the porn, after years of watching girls getting paid to be the ultimate male fantasy, had radically shaped how I interacted and what I expected from my wife. For me, I hope to remove the unrealistic expectations and sexual lifestyle that porn taught me was possible if only I had the right girl. 


Along this journey, I've found other things besides videos and photo websites that now fall under the ""porn"" category for me. Sites like textsfromlastnight and other similar adult humor themed sites. These were sites I read when I was bored for for fun and I didn't think they were the same thing till I noticed the behavior around these webpages was the same as porn. These sites, while not at the creating the same level of sexual high that ""normal"" porn site give, keep me searching for a sustained enjoyment as I read the sexual exploits of supposed ""real life"" stories. Once again, I saw how reading these pages was giving me a false idea of what my life should be. So in the end, I've added them to the list of things which now make me PornFree. This may not be the same for you, but keep track of how your behavior is toward sites you may think are safe enough to handle.

Its more of an effect after reading several posts on PornFree and thinking it may be good just to get some of my own ideas down. I feel there will be more questions than observations, and that's okay. 

I'm cleaning up my office today, taking things out of boxes after a recent move, and I came across the latest SI swimsuit magazine. The cover really got me into the horny for porn headspace, wanting to seek out more pictures. I was able to control it after I saw it for what it was. This reminds me in a lot of ways of how it was to loose a lot of weight. Your brain is so programmed to follow certain functions, that you forget to say no to you when foods are offered. When the half naked model was sitting on the table, my brain went back into thinking about what else I could look at to make my heart rise. 

I came across a good definition of what being PornFree was about. Its about not purposefully seeking out explicit content, or viewing it when available. Kind of like not going to a bar if your have a drinking problem yet also saying no thanks when someone offers you a beer at a backyard BBQ. I know I've been tempted to break my resolve on both fronts. I see them as different ways and the not viewing it when available so far has been my hardest. Advertised images of models was something I always clicked on. Now I try to remember to not even get sucked into the temptation.

In my relationship with the wife (Married 18 months), I notice that I'm not holding things against her that I use to fume about (See my previous post). I think the main part of that, is I'm not having an imaginary sex life with women on screen that is better than what I have in the real world. I'm not saying my sex life is where I want it to be. At least I can say that my calm actions don
t cause a backlash that hurts me even more. 

I thought giving up porn would cause me to get worse in many ways I behave. I thought without that escape and release in my life, I would because the worst version of myself. So far this isn't the case. I feel more mature. I don't let little things bother me, I don't let things get worse, I kind of don't care. Not in the don't care thats actually is the passive aggressive silent treatment, some things that use to bother me don't change me emotional state like it use to. I count this as a victory. 

I continue to notice how much more perked up I become with anything sexual around me. If its a hot girl walking down the street in tight yoga pants, or something suggestive someone says in conversation, i feel like I'm in my teenage years again. I don't need much to set of my mental fantasies. I still feel in my gut that this sort of imagination is better than porn and should be the kind of sexual power that will translate into the goals I have for myself. Looking good or talking dirty with people should get me going, not the latest video on some site. I see this as healthy progress at least. I never thought or had the inclination that I would become a saint or sex-free.

I notice other things in my life slightly changing, but I don't know if its because of the porn free lifestyle of just other things in my life. I thought I was going to be plagued by sexual dream. Some days, I have vivid sexual dreams, but then recently again, I'm out like a light till morning. I seem to be sleeping just fine, once again, not sure if collated.

I always like to hear how your journey is going. Feel free to talk to me anytime.

1363550198.0,11,self.pornfree,1ahaky,Guide 6: Habit Reformation (Power of 21!),14,3,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/pornfree/comments/1ahaky/guide_6_habit_reformation_power_of_21/,"Now I know this topic has been covered quite a bit, but I'd like to offer my take on it with a few variations on what I have found that has worked very well.

* **Habit Cycle**: I've said before that we are creature who seek out comfortable habits, most of the time we are not even aware of our habits. The habit equation is simple, Trigger&gt;Behavior/Response&gt;Reward. The brain creates habits subconsciously to conserve willpower and mental energy for other task. Now when applying this to PMO I believe it is a two part habit Cycle. 

* **Trigger**:Mental distress or depletion of willpower
* **Behavior/Response**: Temptation and rationalization why you should PMO.
* **Reward**: Allowing yourself to begin the **Hunt** (Intentionally looking at or seeking explicit content)

Now The reward of this habit Cycle triggers the next Habit Cycle.

* **Trigger**: The HUNT!
* **Behavior/Response**: Masturbation/Edging/Porn Binging.
* **Reward**: Orgasm and the pleasant realization of ""What the hell just happened...""

Now that you understand how the Habit Cycle works lets talk about how to reform it.

* **Habit Reformation**: Now once a habit has been form it is now a pathway in your brain that can never be undone, but it can be overridden. That being said this is why you really can't ever go back to PMO afterwards, you will only reconnect the Habit &amp; it will be back with a vengeance, but I have a very compelling reason why you should never PMO again and I will talk about that in the next Guide. Now you need to readjust the first habit Cycle. I will give my personal habit reformation as an example.

* **Trigger**: Mental Distress, Willpower Depletion.
* **Behavior/Response**: Reflection in my journal/A Cold Shower/Willpower Booster: 10 min relaxation or nap.
* **Reward**: TV Show, Movie, or a book/comic.

Now I have found difficulty in trying to reform this habit, the reason being is forming a new habit requires a lot of willpower, the whole point of a habit is turn all the willpower you have previously invested into an subconscious response so that you can go form new habits. This is actually why the PMO Habit is so tempting, it requires no willpower &amp; has an instant reward even though it is a mere illusion that dissipates once your done. Once I have experienced mental distress or I am depleted, I feel like doing nothing or trying to skip to my reward &amp; watch TV. The problem with this is you need to disperse the built up energy/emotions through a different Behavior/Response before you enjoy your reward or it will just fester and get worse while your miserably sitting their watching TV. That being said don't binge on your reward enjoy it for the duration of the movie, TV episode, or Book/Comic Chapter and get back to living. Now you can mentally practice the reformation of your new habit by imagining yourself going through the Cycles and changing the behavior.

I have found success recently in a different approach to the PMO Habit. I recommend that you create a battle plan like I did as a final resort but then surround that particular habit with a barrier.

* **Habit Barrier (Mental Distress)**: Now in order to help with the difficulty of the reformation of a new habit I recommend first practicing your skill in forming new habits. Such as working out, committing time to a hobby everyday, meditating, ext. Now the idea behind this is not only are you getting better at forming new habits but you can surround yourself with a new set of habits that works as a barrier to the mental distress trigger. You see we are constantly seeking pleasure &amp; as a result of that we are interested in getting it as fast as we can (PMO Addiction.) But if you begin to a live a rewarding life &amp; you begin to fill your daily routine with Habits that are constantly making you feel good about yourself you won't need to get quick fixes of it through PMO or other addictions. Addictions give you an instant reward but it is short lived. A healthy habit on the other hand requires a lot of commitment and willpower to create, but once you have formed it, the investment you have made will be constantly paying you back in an abundance of fulfillment. With this new found sense of constant fulfillment you won't be seeking PMO Rewards because you have something much more rewarding. Next time you've had a tough day your subconscious response will be this new habit.

* **Habit Barrier (Willpower Depletion)**: Now my previous guides have addressed the subject on how to conserve &amp; increase Willpower, as well as some techniques to use when your willpower is low so I recommend going back &amp; reading those. I wanted to recap on something I have find compelling and helpful for myself &amp; that is the paradigm shift I have recently experienced and has helped me avoid this trigger. My quote puts it perfectly.
* &gt;""Pain comes from within, it is not what happens to us externally that hurts us but our lack of accepting or expecting perfection from our lives &amp; the people in it. We must learn to accept the imperfections, take responsibility &amp; show self compassion in order to be happy."" -ARS 

If you are constantly practicing this philosophy you will find yourself not so often drained of precious resources. Now reading &amp; knowing something are completely different from being able to apply it. Even though I experienced a relapse last week I never stopped trying to apply these principles to my life, I got right back up &amp; continued forming my habits and committed myself to following this philosophy.

* **The Power of 21**: To put it simply it takes on average 21 days (3 weeks) of consecutive effort to create a habit. At the same time it is recommend that you dedicate your willpower to one habit at a time until moving onto a next one. I recommend you write down a list of things that you wish to begin doing on a consecutive basis and put them in an order that you plan to follow. This list can consist of exercising, reading, a new hobby, keeping a journal, ext.) Though I recommend you begin with exercising, it is the most important habit to form for fighting addictions. In order to form this habit you need to have it set in your mind that every day you wake up you are going to workout no matter what. Set a time that you wish to workout, if you are unable to meet your set time one day just let yourself know, you will do this before you go to bed and don't bother listening to your irrational thoughts trying to convince you out of it. Just remember if you can last 3 weeks it will be a habit and require less willpower to do. I have found great success with this and now I do my P90x workout everyday with ease I simply show up and press play. I am on the 4th week with not one day missed &amp; now I am committing my willpower to forming a 4 hour daily study session. Do not allow a relapse to interrupt your habit formations for they are going be one of the reasons you wont relapse again. Once you've worked out for 3 weeks begin to play an instrument or read a book 30 minutes a day while still continuity working out. You can begin multiple habits but only commit to one at a time, make it your mission to form that one habit at all cost.

* **Show UP!**: Starting a new habit will be difficult and will require you to get out of your comfort zone. The key to complete the 21 days is to just SHOW UP! If its working out just show up and complete the run or complete the workout video/regimen. It is not going to be fun and you are not going to be good at it but I guarantee you if you just keep showing up you will get better. Don't get discouraged and always complete the workout no matter what it takes. This is a matter of character &amp; we need to sculpt ourselves into one hell of a character.

One last note when you are doing this for the first time. When you wake up in the morning you are not going to feel like working out for all the wonderful reasons your irrational brain can think of, you just have to remember that it is not what you feel that matters but what you want &amp; what you want is a better life!

This morning, there was a particularly trigger-y piece, and I clicked through the whole thing and was just stimulated.

Huffington Post is actually an example of the broader problem that people have been talking about lately, which is that of being addicted to staring at the computer for hours at a time. It delivers news in this way that I have often described as ""news porn,"" where it's very visually stimulating and makes you want to click on everything. 

SO: I need to get my news somewhere else. There are hundreds of news sites, obviously, but I would like to find one that engages me as EASILY as HuffPo but a) doesn't actually suck at the end of the day and b) doesn't trigger my damn porn addiction.

Music has lost its presence and edge, my wit has faded, and that burning drive inside has been snubbed out.  I drift through the motions in my daily life when I fall and land where I am.  I feel apathy and indifference.  There's no passion and drive that I love to feel so much--that feeling that pushes me forward into the adventures I love and crave in life.  There's nothing down here.  Just a sedated, opiate-like haze where so many people just sort of float along in their lives.  Don't send me back here.  Please.  It's not worth it.  I can only beg you and write this now while I'm here because it's so easy to forgot this feeling when you're stronger and being tempted by what seems like a good idea.  You work so hard and have such high standards and deserve to feel so much better than this.

I never developed any real skills or discipline, I gave up on pretty much everything immediately after I tried it. The only things that made sense growing up were the things that brought immediate satisfaction (video games, porn, shitty food.) I started to realize how depressed and lonely I was around 17, and  now, 4 years later it seems inescapable, especially after an entire unsuccessful year of trying desperately to quit. Every day I seem to try to figure out some way to get out of this, and I just fuck it up. It feels impossible to get out of, so I can't rationalize not using porn as an escape. I can go a week, but once that happens I get curious and I have no safeguards in place to protect me because no matter what, if I want to see it I will figure out a way to look. I've tried internet blockers and locking up the password, but I figure out ways around it. I can't focus, I can't sleep, I hate myself, I feel worthless, I'm inadequate and yet no matter what reinforcement I give myself to quit porn for these reasons, I always relapse practically immediately.

I just don't think I'm going to be able to quit. I don't have the willpower, discipline, outlook, or whatever it takes to get out. I would love to go just long enough to see some benefit and maybe see why it's worth it for myself, but I don't think I'll ever get that far. I keep trying to figure out what it is I need to do in my life to move forward, and I really was hoping that this was it, but I can't do this now, there's obviously something else I need to figure out before I'm capable of it and it's really fucking frustrating to not know what that is.",,False,,t5_2rglh,False,,,True,t3_18mn2c,http://www.reddit.com/r/pornfree/comments/18mn2c/im_so_behind_in_life/,

Basically what im saying is over the last week probably i've just felt less and less inclined to view this disgusting content.

The lust is what you should be mindful of. Lust isn't love. There's a difference. Lust requires no intimate connection and it's based all on the physical. 
I used to think that masturbating was bad but porn was the real problem. It messed me up and I'm currently relearning simple things... like maintaining eye contact, being confident, and so on. All of these things are SLOWLY getting better. True confidence is VERY attractive. It's something that is undeniable because you can only attain it when you overcome your weakness.

I am currently 22 and on the path to recovery.  It began with one image and to this day i can still see that image seared in my head.  as i got used to porn it twisted my fantasies as i got accustomed to weirder and weirder stuff.  Animals, incest, pee I have pretty much been everywhere.  As a youth growing up it made me even sexually attracted to my sister and I went along with this fantasy.  Unfortunately i acted out on the fantasy while she was sleeping and that has been the hardest thing for me to bear my entire life.  Now we come to today.  With porn blockers for over a year on the computer all i could get to was cuckold porn.  Needless to say I have become hooked on this new fetish with over a year of priming.  the worst is it quickly led to forced bi fantasies and porn and i immedietly hate myself after.  It got worse to a point as i would get high and watch the hypnotism videos designed to turn you into just that.  I am now fighting harder then ever Yet just had my weakest point.  Today after reading an account i was on a free computer and searched ""i want to be a gay sissy slut"".  I know I am not gay i have no inclination or have ever had a fantasy like that while sober.

I've been a consumer of pornography since the internet, basically. I remember exactly when it started, and I remember what it felt like to be able to just access this incredibly stimulating media on a whim. It was powerful. I know for a lot of people that might not seem like a lot, but it definitely consumed me.
Fast forward through high-school, college, off-years, now grad school. There were times I'd use pornography for 12 hours straight, just viewing, opening up new tabs (what an invention, right?)---being unable to close them, and flitterring between each one back and forth back and forth. It was like an electric shock. The orgasm wasn't even the best part--and it signified the end of a fiending session.
I'd watch certain videos over and over, skipping around here or there, looking for key positions and sounds and words and phrases--re-engineering everything. Sometimes I'd just go to filter by ""newest"" to just see what was up next on the tubes--looking for more and more to consume and almost memorize. It wasn't fully conscious...it was a compulsion.
I see people with eating disorders talk about triggers. For me, it could be anything. Taking a shower? Time to masturbate--but not before getting out of the shower with the shower running, and either using a desktop--or if someone was home, bringing my laptop into the bathroom. I'd sneak out of my partner's bed and fake being sick just to masturbate. At work--well, smart phones. I'd think about it--what combination I could find next---Asian-Redhead-Naughty-Cheerleader-Gangbang-Space-Theme. It was like coming up with flavors of food and running home to taste them.
Not everyone who views pornography has this same response, obviously--just like not all people who drink become alcoholics. But I'm recognizing that I unfortunately am one of those people for whom porn cannot be consumed appropriately.
I've avoided spending money on Porn--but only out of fear of having my creditcard tied to it and being found out. I was raised catholic and that sense of guilt and repression certainly has not abated (no offense to catholics, but shame is a strong thing). But it's free, and it's out there.
I've seen people involved in porn communities, and I've never done that--too frightening (the shame thing) and strange, and of course anonymity isn't really anonymity--and I've worked hard to keep my addiction to porn a secret.
I've been porn free for a few days, and it's been very stressful. I'm still masturbating, but forcing myself to fantasize freely--not from memory or by using pornography---but the triggers. It's like red meat.
I'm very sexual, but not promiscuous. I have a high-sex drive, but the same shame that keeps me in denial about my porn addiction keeps me from being outward about my sexuality unless I feel very safe.
I've wasted TONS of time, hurt grades in the past, missed out on social opportunities, taken phone-meeting calls while jacking off to porn just because it happened to interrupt it (if it weren't for the advent of skype this would have been much more prevalent).
I don't know. Just wanted to dump my story and ask for help. Reddit, communities? Just typing this makes me feel less tense. I've never spoken to anyone about this.",,False,,t5_2rglh,False,,month6,True,t3_16smrw,http://www.reddit.com/r/pornfree/comments/16smrw/finally_starting_to_recognize_and_attack_my/,
1358345097.0,10,self.pornfree,16onjj,Defining Porn,13,3,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/pornfree/comments/16onjj/defining_porn/,"I have seen multiple comments asking what we define as ""porn."" So I've decided to tell you guys on how I define ""porn.""

Webster's Dictionary defines Porn as:

Definition of PORNOGRAPHY

1
: the depiction of erotic behavior (as in pictures or writing) intended to cause sexual excitement
2
: material (as books or a photograph) that depicts erotic behavior and is intended to cause sexual excitement
3
: the depiction of acts in a sensational manner so as to arouse a quick intense emotional reaction &lt;the pornography of violence&gt;

But to me porn is more than just erotic behavior in pictures or video. The world says porn is the dirty magazines, videos, or websites. But the true problem is not with porn but with lust (IMHO). 

Lust is looking or really the desiring of something that does not belong to us. Lust can be looking at a fully clothed good looking woman and saying, ""I would like to be with her tonight."" It can stimulate the mind or trigger it to start undressing the woman with your mind. Lust is the real root of PMO. I posted yesterday a thread called ""Resetting Badge"" here some where asking why I reset because I watched a movie with a love scene and acted upon that. While some might not consider this ""porn"" I did because I lusted after that woman. When we lust we desire what we do not have. Lust can be looking at a fully clothed woman at the gym, or while walking down the street. When you desire that woman for yourself you are simulating the mind for more. This is all just my opinion. 
Also when we ask the question, ""what defines porn?"" subconsciously I believe that we do not really want to get rid of what we are already looking at that stimulates us. Weather it be that car magazine with babes, or that SI swimsuit calendar.  Better to run far from the line than to ask ""How close can I get before I fail?"" So honestly ask your self, ""what is it that triggers my mind for more?""

Any thoughts? I know this is long but it may be worth it.",,False,,t5_2rglh,False,,month6,True,t3_16onjj,http://www.reddit.com/r/pornfree/comments/16onjj/defining_porn/,

It all started when I used to go to a friend's house. He had just gotten satellite television, when I was still on terrestrial broadcast tv. This meant porn channels. Back when the first five minutes were free. He used to turn it to those channels and watch the first five minutes. At first, against my protest, and then at my begging. I was a young teenager and those hormones were just firing up, so it was thrilling. 

I struggled with porn addiction all throughout high school. Knowing what I know now, that is probably why I had such a hard time with girls. To make things even worse, I was/am a total hypocrite. I was the bible-toting, Jesus loving boy that your momma would be proud for you to take home (which is what I was told by more than one mother), but deep inside I had this addiction.

Fast forward a bit. I struggled through college, missing assignments and getting middle-of-the-road grades. I am intelligent, really intelligent actually, but that could not overcome the rewiring I had done to my brain. I graduated with a degree in Religious Studies and was working at a church (such a hypocrite). 

I got married and laid off the same month. While I thought that marriage and the sex therein would solve my problems, it didn't. Getting laid off and starting another job working nights made it worse. I had always had a inclining toward younger girls, but Reddit provided access to a subreddit with underage pics. This made things a lot worse. I was fapping at work, fapping in bed while my wife was asleep, and I didn't give her near the quality or quantity of sex that she desired. 

My memory is trashed, I can't externalize complex thoughts, my attention span is zero, and I have problems sleeping and “finishing”. I know that the only cure is pornfree. I hope you all can help keep me strong!

Been porn free all 2013 (and a couple weeks of 2012), but edged a few times. Here it goes!

As i filled my brain with more and more shit over the years, like a junkie who needed more to get high, i needed more extreme material to get off. I went through all kinds of shameful phases, femdom, pegging, BDSM, henati, even violent and rape porn. I never once considered that i had a problem, i just thought i was a twisted freak...but what really scared the living shit out of me is that last year i got hard to tranny and even gay porn. it scared the shit out of me. why was i getting hard to it? I even came without touching myself and that was traumatizing. The horrible confusion. But the addictive high...the pounding heart, the light headedness, the sheer wrongness of it all, the venture into the one genre that i was most afraid of. it flooded my sluggish receptors with dopamine. at the time i didn't know all of this, i was just confused and scared and embarrassed as fuck. i knew i wasn't gay i had loved girls and been attracted to females since i was a little kid. why was this happening to me? did i even once consider that my addiction to porn had escalated so far after watching and fapping everyday for years had caused my brain to become sluggish to my initial pleasures? nope. I just watched more straight and lesbian porn after my brief stint with the forbidden fruit. I never quit my porn habit. When i finally did have sex i remember thinking why doesn't it feel as good as i thought it would? (i'm pretty sure all of you porn using virgins out there don't want that kind of first time experience) and when the image of some homo porn popped into my mind...it scared the living fuck out of me. why the hell was i thinking about that when i was having sex with a girl i knew i was physically and romantically attracted to? once again i didn't even consider the neurological science behind it. my desensitized brain, desperate for its dopamine kick regressed to a memory of a powerful experience like cumming without jerking off and put the thought in my mind. i just freaked out and continued to watch straight and lesbian porn. when i finally got to college i spoke to a friend of mine who came out before school and his words chilled me ""I questioned it for like fifteen years but I pretty much convinced myself i wasn't, but i didn't know for sure until a few months ago."" his words started my HOCD. I immediately began fearing that my past encounters were signs of my hidden sexuality. even though in the back of my mind i knew it was ridiculous. looking back i realize that my porn habits were what was keeping my fears at bay. almost like self medication. when i came home for break, my porn use dwindled and my HOCD went through the roof. coincidence? i think not. when i tried to self medicate it was too late, my anxiety and depression had already gone through the roof and it was a horrible experience. briefly later, I found yourbrainonporn.com, this website is proof that God exists. I was able to find a community of people going through similar things i was and offered scientific explanations for what was going on. i then decided to quit porn. 11 days later i'm feeling a lot better. the first week and a half was torturous. my HOCD spikes felt completely unmanageable. i was depressed and anxious all the time. the only peace i found was when i was asleep yet i had trouble falling asleep and staying asleep. i even considered jumping off a bridge at one point. but as the great harvey dent once said, ""the night is darkest before the dawn, but i assure you that the dawn is coming"" getting past withdrawal sucks, but i hope to find a community online here to share my story with and hopefully heal with.

When I think about it, I never have any reason to ever be bored. There's always something that needs to be done. Something that will take my mind off of porn, and make my apartment/life a bit better in the process.

* Do the laundry
* Fold the clean laundry piled up in a corner on my floor
* Clean out the refrigerator
* Clean the kitchen
* Clean the bathroom (scrub out the tub--I really hate doing this)
* Go through old mail, toss out any bills that I've already paid
* Call a friend
* Run errands (buy the shampoo you've been out of for a week)
* Cook something

I can't take it anymore. I want it to change. I have so much that I could waste away. Can some of you help me through this. I want to stop. I want this to stop right away. This is good that we have a place to chat about living in recovery. The hope is that eventually the ones who give a damn about themselves and those that are (still) in their lives will benefit from this community. I can't go on like this. Dull pains and foggy brains - i fucking haaate it. I shake my head when I feel burried in the mistakes i've made, but Ive got to get out. Enough is enough.

Here's my story:

- Discovered porn while entering puberty (oh gawd)

- Went deeper even though I knew I could get caught

- Primetime was when I was home alone

- Discovered fappin soon after and just became a sprinkler

- Man did I ever fap in some of the weirdest locations

- Got quite severe acne and the causation is too obvious to ignore. Acne seemed to get not as worse if I stayed away.

- Got away from porn for a bit as I went through high school but fapping still occured quite a lot. Acne breakouts in the following days. Took Accutane to get the worst of it destroyed. I grew a backbone then I tell ya.

- Got my own laptop for college and that's when things really spun out of control. Im surprised my marks were as good as they were. If it was one thing that carried me through college it was my conscience to pace myself. Thats something that ive seen myself do during long streaks of NOPMO.

- Marks improved when I became an infrequentfrapper - but porn still had an affect.

- 6 years of work life suffered and my weak boundaries caused more domino problems. Work life improved and rich feelings washed back over my spirit when I really went for it.

- Triggers: Alcohol/ drunkPMO, Latenight loneliness/boredom (right now :( ), Computer convenience, Spontaneous Fantasies

- I feel porn is wrong in any dosage, but my body tells me a release is needed every 4 months or so. I stared at ceiling last time i did a planned release.

- Got myself a gaming rig in summer 2011, and i've spent more time gaming in 2012 than total time watching porn in my life :D Gaming has become a social outlet for me to creatively express myself. I can think of only a few problems that have come from that, but they are manageable. 

22 years of life and I've let porn affect a decade that I can never experience again. I've tried, but that trying just isn't good enough. What is it that brought me here? Was it shame? Was it curiosity? Was it loneliness?

I kinda forgot actually. What seems to be a challenge for me now is memory, and I believe that my memory has been affected by hyper-stimulation. This weakness can also be used as a strength. During my long streaks of NOPMO I was just livin. On the go. BUSY. Business is good. The business of business is business. 

I hope to get busy and get away from the computer more. Make a log for total hours spent per day. 

So here's where i could use some inspiration. How can I get busy to help me forget that porn exists, and how can I not be tempted to look up triggering links while on the computer? I could block things but the urge gets around it. I could use a wee bit o' help.

",10,0,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/pornfree/comments/15wpzn/ok_its_time_to_get_serious_and_beat_this/,"After years of fighting this addiction, it's time to get serious and beat this! I NEED this community. I've learned after the last few years that I can't do this alone. I've realized that I am a sex addict. More specifically, a porn addict. This is my story... 

I am in my early 30's and great up with dial up AOL and Compuserve. I got my first job in order to buy a computer. I saved up $1,600 and my teenage mind was exposed to a vast land of dial up porn. Waiting for those single images to load was magical. I would sneak my dad's magazines at times, but the Internet was where I spent most of my time. 

Fast forward to college in the late 90's...T1 baby! The world of Napster, faster Internet, and file sharing. I worked in a computer lab on campus so I had a lot of access to porn. I also had a pretty serious girlfriend, but we weren't having sex (for religious reasons... I'll come back to that later). I started developing stranger desires and fetishes. It was becoming a habit. 

All through college I had a computer in my room at the house I rented with friends. We had cable modem, and it was fabulous! I had privacy, I had speed, and I had a hard drive full of porn.

I tried to quit but couldn't. It's like a drug! You NEED it. I got engaged (same girl as before) and thought it would stop once I got married. Let me tell you... It does NOT! It only gets worse. We were both virgins when we got married and I expected it to be like all the thousands of videos I had seen. I was disappointed.  I turned back to porn. 

It's been almost 10 years since I got married. And I'm still hooked. I'm ashamed and embarrassed. My wife doesn't even know. 

It's gotten so bad that I here off at work in the bathroom, I've been known to call in so I can stay home and surf porn. I've even chatted and watched videos lying in bed directly next to my sleeping wife! I am a sick bastard! 

It consumes me. I find myself chatting and looking up porn on my cell phone now (technology has made this addiction so much harder to beat). Every time I feel ashamed. I am embarrassed and I need help. I can't do this myself. 

This will not be popular here, but I am a religious person (my religion and denomination are not topics for this post -  I'm not going to change your mind and you won't change mine, so let's just agree to disagree for the purpose of this sub). My motivation to quit comes not only from my drug-like addiction, but because I feel a responsibility to my religion to do so. 

But I need support. Physical and emotional support. 

Today I went on a purge. I deleted all my porn from my computer. I deleted Gmail accounts I used for chatting and websites. But my weakness is really my phone. It's literally right at my finger tips.

I skipped a post yesterday, I was very tired and had a long day. But here I am again, hopefully evading the spambot.

That goddamn spambot...

No worries, I actually have created the /r/ValhallaChallenge subreddit. Please subscribe to that subreddit because I have plans to start migrating this whole operation soon. I think this will work better for all, and make it easy for us to access the updates as well as to discuss within a group. It will also help with handling the increasing number of redditors that have been wanting to sign up.

With that being said, let us resume our games.

Go on a site that is supposedly meant for hooking up and you'll figure out soon enough that they're mostly paid sites. I've never done the paid thing myself because it seems like a scam. As they say, 'if it seems too good to be true...'

Craigslist is full of hookers. Any girl on a dating site looking for sex is bound to have a full inbox. I'm not saying that it can't happen, just that the standards are unrealistically high on-line. In the 'real' world few of these women would have a chance, but because of anonymity and high demand they can be choosy. 

I am addressing this because I know a lot of you will try and go this route as I have done. On the surface, it seems like the easier thing to do. In reality, I believe being bold in real settings will get you better results. That's pretty basic info., right? When you're horny and your options seem limited, that doesn't always sink in.

That being said, I am all for online dating. It's an easy way to break the ice and to determine if a woman is single. In some ways it's harder, but tactics are different.

I had a rough week, lost focus and did full PMO on several occasions. Funny thing, I e-mailed the K9 crew to report a site that wasn't blocked. As I was about to send it I thought ""no, wait what are you gonna do when you relapse?"" Horrible mindset, right? Anyhow, the site was blocked later on. But I found other ways to find porn, damnit. I have to stop doing that ""just one search"" and really stop that first domino from falling. If I can just stay pornfree for 2 days I win, it's so motivating to have the number of days pornfree double in just one day.  

Saturday I was at a bar with a friend and we got to talking with two very cute girls and I choked time after time, lots of ""umm"" and ""eehhh"" and I just couldn't concentrate, it was like they were some superior beings and I was not worthy. Couldn't even keep eye contact and it was so disappointing.   

 I even got eye contact with another really cute girl a few tables away but I didn't know what to do! There were three girls talking and I noticed, at least I think I did, them talking like ""that guy is looking at you!"" I wanted to go over there but I blew it. So disappointing. 

Right now my motivation is ""I kinda want to stay pornfree"" but I want it to be ""I need to stay pornfree, I want it SO SO BAD!"" and I got a boost when I realized I can't even talk to girls and realize that they are just people too. Just relax, man!  
 
You gotta want to stay pornfree, you have to, do this for your future self, stop  postponing you improvement. Because you will improve, it's just a matter of time.   
Come on, stop feeling sorry for yourself and start embracing the world around you. There are so many opportunities out there. Go out and kick ass and own the world. These are some of the things I am focusing on right now, pornfree-wise.

That was after spending most of the time for years in a porn haze, and I was in that state at the time.

I also have had an inability to grasp the reality of what could happen in the future as a result of this. If you asked me about what happens to porn junkies in their personal lives and possibly other areas, I would've said that it usually turns out bad stuff happens. I could have probably spat out some examples as well, but the problem was that I couldn't grasp that these things could happen to me.

Now I'm wondering if this is a result of hardcore porn abuse, or if it's from depression. It could also be the result of depression related to an inability to quit using porn.

It is rife with tits.

It's been one week since I've intentionally looked up porn to watch and masturbate to, but I'm lying to myself if I say I'm not eager to see some boobs when I queue up an episode of Game of Thrones or Boardwalk Empire.

Last night, I found myself looking for thinspiration to motivate myself to work out, and realized I was trying to tease myself into openly browsing porn. I even downloaded the Victoria's Secret fashion show rationalizing that I wouldn't see any nudity, but who am I fooling? We all know why I downloaded it. To tease myself. I deleted it without watching it, because I knew where that temptation will lead.

I'm not going to reset my badge, because while this behavior is reckless, and will undoubtedly lead to a full relapse, I think it's safe to say that I didn't pass that threshold of losing my mind in complete fantasy - which I feel is my real problem.

When I watch porn, it is out of habit, boredom, and most importantly escape. I will use(abuse) porn in the same way many people (myself included) abuse alcohol or drugs. I've learned to use it to escape stress, depression, self-loathing, or ANY negative emotions I may be combating.

It is in this sense that I do not feel the need to reset my counter. It's the escapism this self-teasing will lead to that I'm trying to overcome, plus, I feel a sense of pride in recognizing what it was I was doing, and choosing to continue to watch the number on my badge increase instead of opening a new tab and begin browsing pornhub.

Please help?,13,4,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/pornfree/comments/11ja6l/achieved_a_great_life_and_porn_is_starting_to/,"So this is somewhat hard to write - but I thought I would give it a try. I have no where else to turn with this  as this is such a shameful part of my life. It is a rather long post, apologies, but I need help from those who have gone through similar problems. 

I'm a young man in my mid-twenties, living in London, not originally from the UK. I moved here almost two years ago for my dream job - working in development economics. My work environment and home is breathtakingly affluent (have to pause every now and take it all in) -not trying to show off, just got very lucky! I get to interact with politicians, academics, journalists from around the world- and more or less get to be a political and economic nerd all day long, get paid for it, and actually be surrounded by some of my intellectual idols. 

I have a wonderful social life, I row for a competitive rowing club. I'm young and healthy. In the office I am considered the really nice guy, who is a gentleman, kind, and I'm generally liked by all. I'm constantly flattered with compliments on my charm and looks, even told by my CEO at meetings, ""that I come straight out of Tommy Hilfiger ad"" (although I guarantee you I do not have an ego, and actually I have rather low self-esteem). 

Objectively speaking, my life is amazingly wonderful - and yet I am not enjoying it the way I should be, because I recognise now that I am terribly addicted to pornography. 

In part this steams from a relationship that I left almost a year ago. It was a sexless relationship. She was a virgin, I naturally respected her wishes to hold off on sex until she was comfortable and ready for it. I fell madly in love with this girl, it was wonderful, until the day I found out that she had another boyfriend (who I thought was her ex-boyfriend, turned out she never broke up with him). She had been lying and manipulating me for over half a year - it was terribly devastating, to the point that i want into a solitary depression for a couple of months (the clincher - we also work at the same place, which makes life terrible at times). 

I'm not saying that this failed relationship lead me to over-excessive porn use. I know that I had already passed that point years earlier. I was fapping to porn on a daily bases. A good day was when I only fapped once. On most days it would be a least 3-5 times. I also started to watch increasingly more perverted porn - clearly the need to find something new and stimulating. I even end-ed up reading incest hentai doujin comics (don't have a sister, but still, sick shit like that started to turn me on). I would search the main porn producers, to see if they had new girls - constantly needing to find new stimulation. I realised it was getting bad, when I would be getting ready for work, and I would just fap to some porn - I was fapping, sitting in my suit at home, at the exact time that I should have been entering the office. I still got all my work done, and to a high caliber- but the fact that I was making porn a priority started to genuinely make me feel sick (in fact I am sick to my stomach just writing this right now). I finally broke down - when I was searching for porn that resembled my ex (who I never had sex with) as a need to find a virtual substitute. I can not tell you, how sad and lonely I feel at those moments. 

Since the end of my destructive relationship, I also noticed that my ability to sexually interact with girls was not... ideal. I could not flirt with girls, even though it was clear that they were interested in me, found me funny and enjoyable to be around. I felt like I was not living my life like I should be, because I was so ashamed of the person I am in private. On the exterior is this ostensibly nice, charming, and handsome young man - but who could barely keep eye contact with a girl (it requires all my strength to keep eye contact and not shy away when a cute girl looks at me). As a result, I do not see myself as a man, but as this little boy - who is still fapping like he was as a thirteen year old.

I did have a sexual encounter with a beautiful girl a couple months back. She was absolutely stunning. I was fine and erect during kissing and touching. Even during fellatio I was erect - but the feeling I had was for the most part numbness as she was down there. The only sensation I could feel was the pressure - none of the other wonderful things that come with it. When we started to have sex - I was numb beyond belief - I could not feel anything and eventually it became so difficult that I became flaccid. It was a depressingly terrible moment for me.

I realise that porn is taking over my life. I never thought it would get to this point -that I would be addicted to something like this. The thing is, I don't want to ""recover"" just so I can have wild sex with as many girls as possible. I just want my self-esteem back to a higher level, I want to find a nice girl, and to be able to have intimate moments with her as we develop together. It may sound cheesy, but I am romantic at heart - and I want to be able to feel that, and not to disappoint someone because of an addiction. 

I genuinely believe that porn is leading me to a life where I will not be able to have a healthy relationship with anyone. Moreover, I am so ashamed of the person I've become. My family, friends, and co-workers have this image of a good wholesome boy and I just can't bare the darkness that I seem to be in.

Right... so I know I've been writing a great deal. I NEED HELP!. I don't know what to do about it. I've added a ""porn blocker"" on Firefox which works fine - I've deleted Internet explorer (not like I ever use it anyway). But I primarily use Chrome, and I seem to always be able to disable the porn -blocker extensions that I install  (any help on this?).

But, to all those who have gone through the need to completely cut porn out of your life. What steps have you taken? What should I do? I need help, and I have absolutely no idea how to move forward.

I have a great life, and I am so very depressed that I am not enjoying it fully because of some stupid porn websites.

I stopped even being tempted for so long, but really caved today. I might try and incorporate nofap this time and see how I go (I assume this is much more difficult). 

I suppose like many addictions, they don't completely go away. Perhaps I wasn't managing it anymore, so when the temptations came I wasn't prepared. 

But these things happen and big temptation now is to just go crazy for a few days, returning to ye olde ways (why not, I have done it already anyway). But no. It was a once thing.

Porn is weird. Especially since I have been away from it for so long. It wasn't as sexy as I remember it. 

It has been great not using it for various reasons - mainly time not wasted and my approach to sex seems to be ""normalising"". But even after 113 days I felt porn may have been still an element in my mind when it came to sex. I didn't feel fully detached from it. I believe the ""90 day challenge"" is a good start. 

It had just been the last few days, I felt a heightened urgency in satisfying myself sexually. Not sure where it came from, maybe it started somewhere small and I followed it down the road further.

Anyway, I don't expect overwhelming response. This is as much a record for me as it is for the community. This subreddit (along with nofap) are really important. It is the unearthing of a hidden, global scale addiction. 

The Good news is this - I am currently pornfree again and I plan to be indefinitely, taking this as a learning experience.

When I was bored, I would go on pornhub or xvideos to find something new.  When I had the same sense of curiosity, I instead looked up some Latin vocabulary or how to read sheet music, which is a much better use of my time.",,False,,t5_2rglh,False,,,True,t3_zojy3,http://www.reddit.com/r/pornfree/comments/zojy3/i_had_an_epiphany_last_night/,

The conclusion (from some of the previous subreddit discussions) seems to be that it may or may not help, depending on the person, erring on the side of not doing it.

Anecdotally, it's bad for me. Here is, briefly, my experience.

Last night I had a sex dream. It'd been 5 days since I'd seen porn, 3 days since an orgasm. Super-horny, and fighting - FIGHTING - the urge to look at porn. So while in the shower, I thought I'd scratch that itch. And - here's the beauty of it - I could use my sex dream as fodder rather than porn memories. And I did. 

My desire to use porn tripled. I had to run errands, work at the computer in public, and distract myself any way I could. It's still very difficult, which is why I'm posting. 

My working theory is this: a masturbatory orgasm with porn (for some people, at the least for me) provides a large dopamine hit that I don't get when I just masturbate without. Until I've reset sufficiently, I've basically had a diet coke when I really want a full-sugar coke; I got a little bit of what I wanted, but not what my brain really needed. And so I leave myself a bit weaker than before (ironically, I really can scratch the soda itch with diet, but whatever). 

This is an important thing to remember, and also to be aware of. If I try again in a few weeks - after I may or may not have reset - I will remember to have a backup plan in place in case my urge surges again.",,False,,t5_2rglh,False,,month9,True,t3_zohy5,http://www.reddit.com/r/pornfree/comments/zohy5/pornfree_masturbation_warning/,
