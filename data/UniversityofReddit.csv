I was responsible for keeping my entire platoon up to date on Basic first aid, and I think everyone should know at least the bare minimum.

The course would only take about a week, and the best I could hope for is to get you at a level, that if someone was hit by a car next to you, you might be able to keep him alive until the ambulance arrived without causing major harm..

I am not sure when I will have the time to do this, but if there is enough interest I will definitely do my best to find a few days free and throw something interesting together. 

[EDIT] well it looks like I am actually going to have to do this, I can't offer an actual schedule yet since I have no idea when I will have time or how much I will need to prepare. I do however promise to post updates and links to the course when it does come into fruition.

[EDIT] I have registered the Course on U of R, anyone who wish to enrol may do so now, Still no syllabus unfortunately as I still need to work out the details, I have created a Subreddit for the course /r/FirstAidCourse

The only link there at the moment, is request as to how you want this to be done.

This curriculum would allow the student to not only develop writing skills, but also provides an introduction to creating contemporary literature. This includes flash fiction, short stories, as well as novels. Each week, students will be given a variety of writing prompts to choose from where they will create flash fiction around each prompt. They will be able to use the same characters and plot lines throughout the course if they so choose. 

**Prerequisites**: A basic grasp of the English language as well as interest in writing short stories, flash fiction and novels are a must for this class. 

**Schedule**: Lectures and prompts posted Monday, assignment to be posted by Friday, critiques and comments for fellow students through the following week until the next assignment is due. 

Due to the large enrollment, peer editing and critiques will be very important.

Hi everyone seems like the course will go ahead around end of September. Currently I do not have internet access so details will be made available in 5 days, if people are still interested.

 **IMPORTANT: Please keep track of this post as it changes often as interest and help increases! **

**NOTE: This is the newly added section! for all new comers please read below at ""Hello all,"" downwards! Use the find function (Ctrl+F) to find it as this new section will be quite large as time goes on!**


**IMPORTANT! if you are a graduate/PhD student, and currently are doing research or wish to teach, please contact me! Read below in this section under number 3 questions asked for more detail of what I am talking about!**

So as of now, I have 5 teachers (including myself), 1 part time, and 2 unconfirmed genetics teachers. 

The 4 confirmed teachers will all be teaching Neuroscience and their own subset, 1 confirmed teacher will give you the basics and specific of biochemistry (WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT! As understanding neuroscience requires understanding of some fundamental biochemistry!)

Hopefully the 2 genetics teachers will confirm, if so we have 8 in our team, if we manage to get 2 more we can make the videos every 3 weeks (obviously the timing of the videos will be spread out so every week there is something to watch and do!)

 I am still looking for more Genetics teachers &amp; biochem ones, though if you have expertise in neuroscience please don't hesitate to PM me!

one of the main question I get: 

1) How will we structure the syllabus? 

Right so, what I really wanted to happen was for us to cover theory and concept from the base upwards, and once people are up to speed (quite a lot to cover first, we will start at highschool level) they could enjoy and understand research talks from then on with some concept lectures, but please throw your opinion at me because I need to know what you guys think! 

2) I would definitely be interested, but how would this work for people who are not even close to Eastern Standard Time in terms of participation? 

The lectures will all be pre-recorded, with tutor sessions to follow, and dynamically changing lessons to help those struggling or to go faster!

3) Hi I am a researcher/graduate in (any bioscience) and I-

Hold right there! Are you interested in teaching?! Or giving a 10 minute talk about your current research? I am aiming to make a mix of concept material plus current research to students, and either way it would benefit this course! If you don't have much time, just a one off 10 minute video will do! If you are a redditor then you would know about IAMA, this would be sort of like IAMA, apart from you will talk about your research and the students will ask scientific questions regarding your research!

This is my first time posting on Reddit (been lurking for 1 year), I am an undergraduate neuroscience student, and I am also an intern at a chronobiology laboratory. I do understand my grammar is not the best, so do correct me if possible. 

**This is both a interest check, and also a check of what the community demands of me; to see if I have the time to commit to this (so nothing is definite as of yet).** I am doing this due to several reasons:

1. Personally to improve my English, teaching and communication skills, I wish to become a lecturer in the future, and this would be great on a CV too!

2. I am here because I would love to share some knowledge regarding what a lab life entails (as I believe it is not told to us properly at any stage of university/high school, leading to terrible assumptions of how science works and much more.)

3. To part my understanding of what I have read on articles, lectures and much more to people who are interested. I respect those who wish to learn, and understand. (Also to keep articles for those who wish to understand current affairs more accessible)

-----------

**What am I offering:**

I and several of my colleagues will be each individually teaching separate parts of this course; as the check count and colleague count rise, there will be more subjects and modules to follow.
(Note: Remember most of the courses are BASIC entry, so some complex details will be missed out to fit the BASIC courses, advance modules will be set out accordingly when I have enough help to do advance modules)

**The basics:**

**Genetics**: this includes what is DNA, importance of it, creation of protein, transcription to translation, promoters &amp; more.

**Neuroscience**: Basics of what a neurone is, function of neurones and communication between neurones.

**Chronobiology**: Basics of the genetics behind chronobiology in Zebrafish organism model, and possible implications, this is a relatively hot field in research.

**Possibilities/advance:**

There might be a possibility of adding more modules into this course as it gets larger, some include Basic entry **Psychology, Pharmacology and Biochemistry**. AGAIN, this is all just debate at the moment, nothing is finalized. And if anyone knows how to edit the thread name, please comment below :)!

**Subset of neuroscience**: The field of neuroscience is huge, and thus the course will fluctuate depending on the expertise of the group, but we aim to get people who are passionate on certain areas of neuroscience to teach you, and discuss what are the current affairs in that area. (**including neuro-imaging, neuro-cellbiology, computational neuroscience**)

**Biochemistry**: The works of a cell and more!

**Lablife**: little info on Lab life how research works based on my experience and others. Images on equipment and how they facilitate research will be added, questions will also be answered.

-------------

**How will the course be operated?**

I would give probably **10 minute video** lectures at a time for the basics, with some critical reading material (relating to how the field started/latest research on the field.)

The Genetics module would be more of a ""pre-requisit"" for the Chronobiology.

I hope to get some of my colleagues interested if they have the time, some of them are more specialized in bio-chemistry, others in imaging of neuroscience who can give better insight into that field. 

I have linked this page to a few of my colleagues, and I am thinking if we can get probably 5 or more to participate, we could spread the workload to about each person creating a 10 min video every **2 weeks (or every 3 weeks) (totaling 50+minutes every 2-3 weeks.) With some reading materials** to cover the rest of the downtime, more info will be posted as I continue to get more information. 

Thing to note about 10min videos, it will be condensed, so don't be disappointed if it weren't a 20 hour course per month (That is a massive amount of hours! :O) as I am sure the 10minute videos will be a lot in itself!

As far as which courses will be taught first, I think the basics of genetics and neuroscience first (or other per-requisites), then I/we will slowly start integrating lab life, current affairs and other courses. 

**Tutor groups will also be held in a subreddit** for students to discuss among themselves with possible lecturer to jump in and steer them in the right direction for each video session.

**Research talks** I aim to bring in people from different labs to talk about their work once most basic concepts have been taught, relating concept with research material, these will happen as one off 10 minute talks.

-------------

**What makes us difference from generic Youtube videos online?**

So some people have personally asked me what difference is this compared to some of the Youtube clips already online? Well, there are three parts to this question I like to mention:

1. Typically the Youtube videos are quite scattered, it would be nice to organize it into a condensed form in one location, easy to browse and find.

2. It will be tailored to make it an access course for complete beginners to (and this is the crucial part) understand current research and affairs, making it much more understandable how research works and why they are doing what they are doing.

3. Final is to add relevant reading material (current, and old), such as understanding the reading material (if it were old material).

-------------

Final note: In no way am I senior researcher etc, I state again I am an undergraduate Neuroscience student, but I am happy to learn and part as much of what I have learned to anyone who is interested, both for your gain and mine, this is also a learning curve for me, and a great opportunity!

Is anyone interested in filmmaking or production courses? After a search it seems the last courses were over a year ago. There are a number of possibilities for a course such as this, it can be an all over general course, with a syllabus such as:

1. Theory
2. Script
3. Camera basics and shooting
4. Set
5. Post
6. Conclusion/The industry

Or I can do a specific course on any part of the production process (except for sound, I won't pretend I'm an expert at that), if people here already know the basics and want a more in depth course. There was a request recently asking for Film Theory classes, which I can do as well if there's interest.

I am an NYU film alumni and have been working in the Hollywood film industry in LA for five years. I've been on so many productions that I've lost count, from little web vids to big budget studio productions. I just like sharing the knowledge. Also, its summer and I'm bored.

Go there for more details.**

**If you're interested in this class, reply to this post and a PM will be sent to you containing the final details.**

**UPDATE: The Juicy Deets**  
Alright everyone, so there is definitely sufficient interest in this for me to go forward with it. I am currently in the process of trying out different solutions to find something that will work best. For all those who asked, I will definitely be recording the classes--I don't want anyone to miss out for reasons beyond their control. The classes will begin Sunday, November 18th. I will send a PM to anyone who replies to this post with all the details on how to join the class, and details on where to go to watch the recorded videos. I will also make another post (an UPDATE post) a few days before the class begins with all the exact details. A note, you do *not* have to install Arch Linux or CentOS on your system. If you're comfortable with Ubuntu, or Linux Mint, then keep that. We will only be installing CentOS in our KVMs--the host does not matter. I will work with people in any distro to get the lab properly set up. Please, if there is anything that you're interested in learning, let me know so that I can get into the final syllabus.

**Original Post**  
Hello all. Back in the day when I got into Linux there was an incredible guy on the EFnet channel #linuxhelp whom I owe much of where I am today and what I know to. He was always willing to help a newb. So, in the spirit of awol (that was his handle), I am offering a class for those interested in learning Linux. We will be working in CentOS, because that is the best distro to know if you ever plan on being a system administrator.

**What are the requirements for the class?**

No knowledge of Linux is required. Because we will be working with KVM, you will need a CPU that supports hardware virtualization. You can find out if your CPU supports hardware virtualization by checking the manufacturer website for your CPU. For example, if we check the product details for AMD's Phenom N930, we will see that there is a ""Yes"" listed next to ""AMD's Virtualization Technology,"" which means that the CPU supports hardware virtualization. If we check the product details for Intel's i7-2600, we see that there is a ""Yes"" listed for Intel's Virtualization Technology (VT-x), which means that the CPU supports hardware virtualization. If you're already in Linux, you can check by typing  grep svm /proc/cpuinfo for AMD CPUs, or grep vmx /proc/cpuinfo for Intel CPUs. If the grep statement returns nothing, this means your CPU does not support hardware virtualization. If your CPU returns some text, you're good to go. If your CPU does not support hardware virtualization, then you're more than welcome to use Virtualbox, or some other solution. However, I will not be supporting such a setup, so you'll be on your own following along.

I will be streaming my desktop, thus you will need to be able to view the live stream. As well, I recommend having a mic, though this is not necessary. We will be communication via our mics, but I will also try to get a chat environment setup as well.

**When?**

We will meet every Sunday evening at 7PM PST. If you'd like to meet at a different time, please let me know. 

**Syllabus**

*Week 1: Getting Installed, KVM setup and the shell*  
First, we will get Linux set up on our systems. I will be doing this in a KVM, but you're more than welcome to set it up on your system. I am running an Arch Linux host, and will be running CentOS VMs. The install will be CentOS. We will then setup 3 CentOS VMs. After our environment is setup, we will be covering the basics of the shell environment. What is a shell? What can we do with the shell? Getting around the filesystem, and so on.

*Week 2: The shell in-depth*  
We will spend some time comparing different shell environments (e.g., bash, ksh), and more in-depth subjects, such as piping, redirection, some basic shell scripting (loops, conditional statements), environment variables, files (.bashrc, etc), aliases, builtins, signals, brace expansion, and more. Our focus will be on the bash shell.

*Week 3: System management*  
We will cover the log files, configuration files, vi, disk and network management (e.g., ip command, lvm, fdisk, ethtool, what's a jumbo frame?, etc), package mangement, ACLs, temporary vs. persistent changes, sudo, user and group management, quotas, difference between hard and soft links, grub, fstab, LuKS, cron/at, processes and runlevels.

*Week 4: Services*  
We will cover NFS, ftp, Apache, mail server, CIFS, automounter, VNC and some basics of DNS. We will also look at how these things work with SELinux and iptables, and we will be delving in-depth into SELinux policies and roles.

*Week 5: The Kernel*  
We will be building packages from source, creating RPMs, creating our own yum repositories, building a custom kernel, looking at proc and sysctl. We will then create a kickstart file with %post scripts to setup a VM to our exact specifications.

*Week 6: Shell Scripts*  
We will begin by writing some simple shell scripts.

*Week 7: Advanced shell scripts*  
More scripting. Arrays, regular expressions, debugging our scripts, and more.

*Week 8: Tcl*  
We will cover the basics of Tcl to get ourselves ready for next week.

*Week 9: Automating system administration with Expect*  
We will build on all of our knowledge gained thus far and build some Expect scripts to automate the tasks that we have learned how to do.

*Week 10-15: Perl*  
Now that we know shell scripts and Expect, we will be expanding on that knowledge with Perl + Expect to create a system administration automation suite. The end product will manage our VM network, adding/removing users in bulk, changing passwords, locking user accounts, and so on.

*Week 15-20: Administration of LAMP server*  
We will cover MySQL, Apache PHP, BIND, OpenLDAP, and Postfix+Dovecot in-depth. The focus of this will be the administration of these services. For example, we will learn what an SFP record is, and a virtual host.

*Week 20-25: Advanced Perl scripts*  
We will be creating a MySQL backend for our system administration scripts from earlier, and expanding our scripts to make a full fledged system administration suite. We may set up a VM running OpenIndiana (Solaris-based) just to have a mixed platform environment. We will also be using the Net::LDAP module to manage our users who will now be stored in an LDAP setup. We will also write a Nagios plugin.

**About Me**  
I have been a Linux user for 15 years now, and have worked in some sort of administrative role for 10 years. I have extensive experience with Linux, Solaris, AIX, and HP-UX. I love automation, and truly believe that the best system administrator is the one who does the least amount of work.

**Other Stuff**  
Please, if you have any suggestions, let me know. I am always open to constructive criticism. The class is a collaborative environment. I am still learning as well. If you already know your stuff, why not join and help out? Keep me in check, add to the discussion, whatever you can do. If you're interested in signing up, let me know.

Just gauging interest here, if a few people would like something like this I'm thinking of putting together a course.  It will be mostly a curated series of resources and occasional, relatively easy assignments for practice.  This will be primarily geared towards the beginner or someone who hasn't had any practice in a long time.

Here's a rough idea of what the course will entail: I will start with basics of design, color theory, whitespace and typography.  From there I will move to applying those things to static pages with HTML and CSS.  Once we have our pages built, we'll go into the idea of user experience (UX) by adding an ""experience layer"" to our designs.  If we still have steam after that I may go into the basics of javascript and jQuery but we'll cross that bridge when we come to it.

**tl;dr Leave a comment if you're interested in learning basic, modern web design principles (not the outdated crap they teach in college).**

Edit:  Looks like enough people are interested to make it worthwhile.  I will begin creating a rough outline of how things will go.  I'm thinking I will try to post updates on fridays so that people can do the reading and work at their leisure over the weekends.  Don't worry, I'll try not to make it too much to keep up with as I don't want this to be a huge commitment for anyone :-).

Since there are so many different vendor certs out there i thought i would just make one thread to cover them all and people can comment / upvote which ones they like most. 

My area of expertise is primarily VMware so if there's enough interest in VCP i could put together a course for that (Note to actually get a VCP cert you need to attend a VMware certified course, which this would not be, but there is nothing stopping anyone teaching all the knowledge anyway, and teaching what the official course doesn't.). I also have a MCTS and CCNA certification, so i could try and build a course for one of those as well, but i suspect there are more qualified people around that could help out :)

The bonus about industry certs is after you learn all the course material through this, you could go to an official testing centre to earn your certification *(with the exception of some such as VCP that have additional requirements)

About Me:

I am a native Spanish speaker who has been teaching the language to both non-Spanish and Spanish speakers for years. I´ve teached at an elementary and higher levels. I have worked as a Spanish tutor for companies´ employees as well. I pretty much know everything about the basic areas of the language: structure, speaking, reading and writing and throughout the years have learned how to transmit this knowledge to my students.

Let me know if you have any suggestions or some specific topic(s) you would like me to add to the above syllabus. I am open to comments, critics, questions and suggestions. 

Please remember that this class will start MONDAY NOVEMBER 12th and I will be uploading the class content three times a week: Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays around 8 p.m. EST (sometimes earlier, sometimes later). When a live session is taking place, I will announce in a post ahead of time the exact date and time in which it will take place. 

Thank you for reading and for your interest. Looking forward to see you at my Spanish lessons.

Also, please check back soon the University of Reddit for my other new course offerings: Vlogging (Video blogging) and Podcasting Like a Master, Exploring Journalism and the Media and Photojournalism: An Introduction soon.

Additionally I could touch on other scripting languages etc. such as Lua within the context of video games, as well as non-programming aspects of game development such as pixel art, music and sfx, design, etc. If there is demand I can continue the course with other languages however that's probably unnecessary due to there being similar courses already available here. 

Game development has been a hobby for about 5 years, I started with Game Maker and have used it most of the way in addition to other languages. I have also almost completed a GCSE level course in Music (did not complete as I had to switch schools toward the end due to bullying issues :&lt;) and have learnt game design, pixel art etc. along the past 5 years. That's pretty much all my experience with game development that I can think of.

I can't prove to you that this one won't. You'll just have to trust me on it.

I am a web developer with a background in Ruby and Rails. I'd love to do a course on them both, but they are big topics and I want to commit myself to something easier first to get a feel for it. If HTML/CSS goes well, I want to move to Javascript, and from there to server-side technologies. I am not sure I'll make it that far, but I *will* make it through any course I have started.

Before working as a web developer, I taught web development and computer programming in high school. I miss teaching, but suffice it to say high school was not the environment for me. That's why I'm here. To fill the void in my heart. *sniff*. I bring this up to point out that I am familiar with teaching and already understand the commitment involved. I won't burn out because I'm in over my head. I should say, though, that I have prepared a course that goes much further than I had time to do for my high school class.

Anyone who has never made a computer game before.  This is *not* a course on how to write code.

**Pre requisites**

* An interest in making your own computer game as well as a grasp of the English language.
* No programming knowledge is necessary!
* A Windows computer (to run [Construct 2](http://www.scirra.com), the software being used to make games with).

**Schedule**

The course will last 4 weeks, by the end of which you will have your very own 2D platform game which you can share on the web with your friends and family!

**At the end...**

* Students will be able to have the confidence to make their own computer games
* Students will have a basic understanding of computer logic (loops, variables, boolean logic)
* Students will hopefully be motivated to continue their quest in game making/computing and have the confidence to peruse this interest!

**About me**

Me and my brother have been running Scirra for 1 year now and have developed Construct 2.  We'd love to show people how to make games with the free edition.

Construct 2 is being used in schools and universities all around the world at the moment, lots of teachers believe in its educational value.

I've got a decent amount of free time that I wouldn't mind putting towards a well-made music theory course here, ideally with contributions from several people to teach everything from bare basics to some more intermediate and advanced topics.

So, would anyone honestly appreciate the effort I'd put into this? I don't want to waste my time if it's not going to get a response, but if a theory class is something enough people wanted I'll gladly start putting some materials together.

If anyone has any ideas for course topics this would be a good place for them, too.

**PREREQUISITES:**

-FL Studio 10 or later

-Windows 7, 8, or any OS that can run FL Studio

-Basic computer knowledge

It will be starting Thursday night, hope to see you all there.



I'm well experienced in life drawing at this point, and I can certainly teach people from the basics up.

There's a specific thing people who don't draw (and probably some who do) are unaware of. It's that you don't actually see things correctly, because your left brain thinks in terms of pure symbols instead of noting the individual look of the subject you're trying to draw.

I could get into much more detail with an actual class, using real examples and such.

So, is there interest and also what kind of format would people like? I could possibly do live video streams of classes if that seemed like a good option, though time zones could be an issue. (I'm an Irish resident)

EDIT: Ok, it's looking likely I'd do a live broadcast should anyone feel be able to make it, but either way I'd put up the video afterwords that people could return to at their leisure.

Someone brought up materials. Technically, you can use whatever you want to make marks on a page. But ideally, I'd rather you use a [pencil that's somewhere in the 2B+ range](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pencil#Grading_and_classification) because with those softer leads you can get more variation into the line. But also pencils are both cheap and rather precise.

You can still use whatever materials you want, graphite, ink, paints, tea bags. As long as it marks a page (or indeed, whatever medium you want to make the marks on) then it can work.

Given that you're likely to be beginners, starting with pencil is likely where most of you would go for the start at least. Who knows, maybe I could even do one class where you specifically **have** to pick a medium that is not traditionally used so you can learn about the diverse effects it can have.

EDIT EDIT: Oh and in terms of brand, I don't really consider it that important. There are plenty of high quality ones and then rip off expensive ones, but truth be told I've never been good to spend the money on high quality materials. I'm not as particular as others I've met who love certain varieties and brands, I will honestly pick up whatever's to hand and draw with it. I only even specified the B range so that the lines will be able to be darker and give you more variation in *how* you draw the line.

Introduction: If you have never played Starcraft before, we would like to introduce to you the world of Starcraft! The game can be very intimidating and overwhelming at first, but anyone who has played the game consistently can tell you that you will get better with time and winning ladder games can be extremely satisfying.

Basics (Bronze and Silver):
Everyone starts somewhere and personally when I first started I was placed in silver. With tips from forums and my own individual practice, I was able to reach Masters league fairly quickly. The most important part we can focus here are mechanics and macro. Once we have that down, the fun strategy portion begins! (You can't start playing Jimi Hendricks without learning a couple of basic chords!)

Fundamental Strategy (Gold-Platinum):
After mechanics are strengthened, players will need to able to react and read their opponents. This portion will show the basics of how to scout effectively, how to react once you have figured out what your opponent is doing, and executing your game plan. 

Fundamental Strategies II (Diamond League)
Anyone who is in Diamond league can tell the leap to Masters league is a tough one. You may have the mechanics, you may have the correct strategies in your head, but you might not know how to pinpoint exactly what you are doing wrong or how your opponent is taking advantage of the situation. This is the area to tighten up your basics and fundamental strategies.

Advanced Strategy: (Masters and Grandmaster's)
Your mechanics are good, your strategies are good, but like everything else in life, there is always something new to learn. In advanced strategies, we will break down professional play, learn to set up your strategies, and focus on specific ways on how you can improve your play (eg: Focus on better creep spread, harassing as protoss, etc.)

This is a large project and I am willing to organize all of this but I cannot do this on my own. I need a community to help me develop this into something special. Please let me know if you are interested and I can get started on scheduling, staffing, and getting this whole thing rolling!

Topics: The construction of gender and sexuality, history of sexuality in the US, religion and sexuality, LGBTQ rights, Civil Rights, political/economic/social history, anarchist and leftwing movements, rise of the conservative agenda, HIV/AIDS. 

Credentials: Tons of research in the field. Wrote one paper on Rhetoric of Homosexuality in the Crusades, working on one of the post-Stonewall gay liberation response in RI. Already taught the course at a University for it (http://digitalcommons.uri.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1283&amp;context=srhonorsprog .....check after the powerpoint for syllabus, readings, assignments and rubrics etc).

I have plenty of things for us to do, but I want it to be worthwhile. Never done this before so anyone with experience could maybe PM me?

**Edit 3:** Tried to PM y'all from uofreddit but it seems to be broken. Here's my update for y'all:


Hey folks!

This course is def. going to happen. I am working on cutting a two-time a week in-class semester long course into a 10-12 week once a week lecture/discussion based online class. I would rather do it right then half-ass it. I have not forgotten about you all but the Marshall and Fulbright deadlines on campus are in the coming weeks and that has taken a bit of priority. Hope to start mid-late September and run as long as you guys will put up with me. Suggestions are always welcome!

I discovered UoR, but was sad to notice that it had no classes pertaining to music at all. So, I thought I might start one.

The first course (Basics of Music 101) is for those whose only experience with music is listening. It covers basic concepts such as notation, rhythm, clefs, accidentals, scales, keys, identification of different instruments, and other essential information necessary to understanding the world of written music.

The second course (Intro to Music Theory) is for people who already have some understanding of music. The prerequisite knowledge for this course is: understanding rhythm, notation, keys, scales, intervals, chords, and basically everything covered in the other class. In this course, we'll go over chord function, basic roman numeral analysis, harmony, and more, and we'll even take a look at some excerpts from actual music.

If there's enough interest, I'll create the class(es), learn how to make the site go, and we'll start sometime in early April.

The newly formed non-profit creating a new MOOC based on your needs.",167,20,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/UniversityofReddit/comments/17pnck/announcement_ureddit_meet_open_compass_the_newly/,"Hello URedditors!

On May 6, 2010 a simple post on /r/askreddit resulted in this very subreddit. In August, 2010 we developed ureddit.com, a simple platform that allowed teachers to create courses and increase communication with students. Since the founding post we have had students and teachers come to UReddit from 195 countries, with 3.5 million unique views, and 70,000 registered members.

Initially it was a one man show, /u/anastas put more sweat and elbow grease into making the platform stronger as we began to understand just how important open education was becoming. Then your current UReddit team assembled, consisting of Ph.Ds, entrepreneurs, communication professionals, and the best subreddit moderators around. With a completely volunteer based team spread throughout the US, it was an interesting challenge to work together and continue to help each of you teach and learn from one another; however, thanks to technology we established an amazing organization.

As of August 27, 2012 that organization became something more formal, a non-profit devoted to leading you to open education. With a mission in place, we knew that UReddit as a platform would not be suitable for the amount of growth we have seen. With this Open Compass was born.

There are plenty of online education and massively open online class (MOOC) platforms, all with their own unique reasons to contribute to open education. However, many are for-profit or still continue to focus on many aspects of traditional education systems that do not translate well to Web based learning. For this reason Open Compass has been developed as the next stage for UReddit. Our offerings can be taught live, at your own pace, or even a hybrid of in class and online. A system developed specifically based on all of the feedback we have received over the past two years. A community based education platform built by you, for you, and all of the proceeds go back into the continued advancement of Open Compass.

So, how do you get access to Open Compass? This is the difficult part, but we believe opening education is such an important cause for the future development of knowledge and information that we will not hesitate to ask: **We need your assistance to make this happen.**

**We have the new platform built, but it needs a few coats of paint and developers to ensure the foundation holds.** Unfortunately designers and developers cost money, so we are launching a KickStarter campaign. The KickStarter campaign will allow us to cover the remaining costs, and of course provide you some awesome swag as well. For those curious, we do also have other funding models developed as well, so after we have kickstarted Open Compass we’ll be working with schools, universities, organizations, and anyone else that needs their own custom designed private training and education platform separate from our new platform (but you won’t have to worry about this).

So my fellow redditors, shall you lend us your sword, perhaps a shield, and more importantly bacon (I prefer beer)? With your help we can ensure Open Compass remains a non-profit with a mission of leading you to open education.

For more details [please view our Kickstarter page and trailer here](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1918344721/open-compass).

**Open Compass Features (to be improved upon):**

* Video streaming of live lectures

* Recorded lectures are automatically processed for speech-to-text to generate transcripts, and increase accessibility for the disabled

* Teachers can also display slides or share their desktop

* Students have audio chat and can enable webcams if they like

* Fully-featured course management software similar to the type used by many major universities (including gradebooks, quizzes, calendars, a chatroom, and much more)

* Live lectures are automatically recorded if desired

* User and admin levels (Instructor, TA, grader, student, observer, etc.)

* reddit instance for general and public discussion

Our official announcement of the formation of our non-profit and press release can be found on [our new blog](http://opencompass.org/blog/?p=9).

Russian is by far the most widely spoken Slavic language, and official language (at some level) in ten countries and the United Nations and spoken by sizable minorities in many other countries, and it is important in European energy and security affairs.

This would be an introductory level course that would teach:

* The Cyrillic alphabet
* Russian grammar and syntax
* All Russian cases (at least in the singular form; plurals may be too much)
* Russian verbs (perfective vs. imperfective; present, past, future, and imperative conjugations)
* Basic vocabulary (food, recreation, traveling, schooling, etc.)
* Basic Russian culture (geography, cuisine, living, etc.)

If there is enough interest, this class would start at the earliest in two weeks and the latest 1 Sept, and it would go for three months.  Schools and universities will have started again and this way there wouldn't be a large drop in activity.  There would be live class time probably twice per week, lessons using online and PDF materials, and optional assignments/quizes that I would grade.  This being my first course for UoR, I am not sure what resources I will use (Skype, Google+, Doodle), but if I started this class, I will be determined to finish it.

Any suggestions would be helpful, as would who would be interested and who would certainly join, especially in the live chats.

* 1.) Introduction
- Why did Google develop Android? Google's Philosophies
- Setting up Eclipse (downloading SDK, installing ADT)
- Hello World
* 2.) The Manifest File : Let's Go Meta
* 3.) Activities: The Life Force

* 5.) Layouts I: Introduction to Widgets
* 6.) Layouts II: Advanced Widgets
* 7.) Layouts III: Handling Various Screen Densities
* 8.) Phone Sensors: Interacting With Our Masters
* 9.) Tablets: Go Big or Go Home

- I have been doing iOS development as well for about 6 months

- Fair knowledge of Object - Oriented Programming
- Some experience with Java

I'm the only one left that's been doing anything to help UReddit over the past year or two and it's gotten to the point where a significant improvement requires a number of things like a complete website rewrite (which I became ambitious enough to plan several times but never got around to actually starting), a coherent marketing strategy, and more time to devote to the community. 

I'm a full-time student taking grad level classes and applying to graduate school at the moment; the amount of time that I will have is only going to decrease. If things had been different, we might have grown several times larger and received official attention from the Reddit admins rather than a casual ""Hey, we like what you're doing"". I wasn't able to make that happen.

So, who wants to take over the leading role of UReddit?

**Edit**: I'll begin responding to individual offers a little later.

**Edit**: Some additional information about the server/website at the moment. Standard LAMP setup on a Linode running Arch Linux. The code is horrible because it was written in several hours (in one sitting) with the mindset of ""let's have something functional as soon as possible.""

I'm not sure if this will be a very popular offer, but I'll give it a try.
This class will cover movements going from early cinema to the French New Wave. This is not a class about contemporary cinema (which I could eventually build if there is interest).

We will explore the notions of ""a canon"", ""influence"", ""auteur"", and much more. This class is a **history** class. We will explore film theories, movements and techniques, but we will **not learn** how to make films. We will learn about movements such as : German expressionism, early Russian Cinema, Poetic realism, Neorealism, Film noir and so on.  This class will have a very open take as to what ""film history"" is and will question the canon movements while trying to let you develop your own critical sense when it comes to film. I will try to balance academical notions and non-academical notions to make it fun and easy to follow.**This is a class for beginners**, which means : people with interest for him who have never taken a film history class.  People with film knowledge are more than welcome to participate. This class will allow you to learn about film culture without having to take part in an expensive college class. However, I encourage you to eventually do it as it will help you get a better grasp of how film history is constructed.

There will be no assignments. Each class will be either text based or video based (see form). There will be **discussions** and a list of films to watch for every class. A list of optional readings will also be provided when available. I will try as much as I can to provide free and legal ways to see the movies that are ""hard"" to find. If that's not possible, I'll find alternatives. There **could** be livestreams, in form of ""hangouts"" where we all watch a movie at the same time.

**About me**  
I am a film Major and I'd like to be a film teacher eventually. I'm also a video artist (I've shown my work in many art galleries) and I've written for various local paper and online magazines about film (in French). I am not a film studies PhD but my understanding of film and film history will make it an interesting and fun class.

**Why would you want to take this class?**  
- To learn about film history, obviously  
- To understand where the films we watch now come from  
- To understand the importance of cinema in modern culture  
- To be able to *see* films in a new way  
- To develop a passion for movies of any kind  
- To share and discuss your vision of film  
- To learn how to name-drop! Oh sweet, sweet name-dropping.  
- If you ever wanted to take a film history or art history class, this will give you a taste of what it's all about  
- This is **not** a film making class. However, if you are trying to become one, knowing about film history is pretty important in my opinion. For a technical class, go here :  http://www.reddit.com/r/FilmClass

Since my semester starts in late August, this would be a quick and dirty crash course beginning either Thursday (7/25) or Monday (7/29)

**Course Description**: The goal of this course would be to introduce beginning or intermediate fiction writers to a set of formal terminology and concepts, both practical and theoretical, that they can then use while composing or editing, and which will allow them to read fiction in any genre for specific craft elements.  Course ""assignments"" will include optional craft discussions on ""required"" readings and optional creative writing assignments that emphasize a certain craft element.  The course will be run asynchronously, and would probably be the first in a series of more specific courses on the individual topics covered.

Readings will include craft essays, short stories, and short stories that have been marked up as a model for students to emphasize certain elements of craft.

**Prerequisites**: Readings will be distributed via Google Drive or through web links, learning modules will be posted to the course subreddit, /r/CreativeWritingCraft.  You'll need something that can open .doc and .pdf.

**Qualifications**: B.A. and M.A. in English, with coursework and my thesis focusing on literature, narratology, and critical theory.  I'm currently a candidate for an M.F.A. entering my final year at the program.  I have ~5 years experience teaching Rhetoric and Composition and ~2 years teaching Creative Writing.  I'm also currently an assistant fiction editor at a nationally distributed literary journal.

* Module 1: Story Structure
* Module 2: Characterization and Character Development
* Module 3: Telling Time
* Module 4: Point of View/Focalization (Intro. and Advanced)
* Module 5: Genre: Blending and Bending
* Module 6: Language and Discourse (Intro. and Advanced)
* Module 7: On Writing and Revision
* Module 8: On Business and Publication

I'd also be willing, once the course starts, to look at a few students' stories or novels or what have you and give brief editorial comments (i.e., my reaction as an editor at a journal if I were to read your story in slush) and possibly suggestions for revision.  I'd probably do this once a week for 4-5 people I'd choose through a lottery on the course subreddit. 

Let me know in the comments below if you'd be interested in this class, or if you have any suggestions for material to cover or changes you'd like to see.

**Summary:** I am a graduate student studying City and Regional Planning who is absolutely fascinated by every aspect of cities. I'd like to offer this course on city form and function to satisfy people's curiosities about anything from broad philosophical concepts of cities, to the smallest details about city codes such as the significance of sidewalk width and so on. 

**Possible Content (includes but isn't limited to):** Social and Economic Functions of Cities | Philosophy of Cities | Landmark Land Use Law | Public services | Urban Design Theory | Transportation Planning Theory | Urban Development | History of Urban Planning | New Urbanism etc.

These topics are very broad, and several weeks worth of courses could be taught on each. However, I won't teach something that no one has an interest in learning, so please provide input on the most desired topics, or even post your own questions and we can tailor it according to interest. 

**Description:** I will do my best to relate these topics into easily understandable, relatable, and useful information for the students. Courses will likely be a short PPT lecture followed by class discussion of the topic and Q &amp; A, allowing for the class to learn more about their specific interest related to the topic. There will likely be some recommended supplementary reading included for those who really would like to learn more. No papers or anything... Just a class to put the information out there for anyone who wants to know!

EDIT: I always want to learn about other cities as well! There's so many cities, towns and villages all over the world that I would also love to learn about where everyone is from and the things they love/hate about their city!

The course will be defiantly not about on how to jam a Adurino board into a box and solder some LEDs to it nor an everlasting debate on what the best brand is.
In this course you'll get to know the basics of microcontollers, how to integrate it properly in your circuit, the first ""Hello LED"" program, use of the integrated peripherals (ADC, communication units, EEPROM, ...) and much more.
Also this class won't be bound to a specific brand, I'll do examples on both Microchip PICs and Atmel AVRs.

If you are interested drop a comment, ideally with you personal interest so I maybe know what you want to know more about.

UPDATE: I have to get my projects done first, the class will be starting in 2-3 weeks when the semester is (kinda) over.
I thought of a tutorial -style approach for the main lessions and a live vent Q&amp;A on some questions after one lession.

FAQ:

1: *Materials needed?*
The expensive part will be the programmer. The average price of these things varies from 5 to 30 bucks. The cheapest one I could find is the ""USBasp"" for most of the ATMEL micros.
My personal suggestion would be to buy a PICKIT2 or the USBasp I mentioned before.
..and while you are at it, I suggest you to buy a breadboard, headerpins, soldering stuff, a veroboard, some other stuff involving your project (LEDs, relays, something like that) and of course one or more standard microcontrollers (ATmega8, PIC18F4550, ...).

2: *What should I already know?*
The basic knowledge for this course is knowing at least a bit about electronics, that means:
*You know what voltage/current is and Ohm's law
*You know Kirchhoff's two famous laws about currents and voltages (voltage divider for example)
*You are willing to read datasheets

Additionally, knowledge of these topics can be useful:

*Usage of capacitors/diodes and transistors
*ANSI-C

3: From scratch developing?
Yes. That means that you'll be experimenting on a breadboard with your parts and maybe turning your circuit into a PCB.

4: What topics are discussed?
I'll split the whole course into different parts:

*Basic circuitry and choosing you microcontroller
*Setting up your IDE and programming the first program (featuring a LED)
*Basic C and ASM routines (timed loop, setting inputs/outputs, bitwise operations)
*More information about outer circuitry including interrupt pins, PWM, timers and I2C/TWI, USART
*Interrupts and Timers
*the internal ADC and DAC techniques
*Communication with the USART and the I2C Bus/ TWI
*Interfacing a LCD


Many thanks for the awesome reputation so far, I am glad you like to have a course about this stuff!

Once the basics are covered, I will cover in gory detail the challenging topics of pointers, memory management, and structures.  I will follow this with examples and exercises to practice using C to solve problems and use common algorithms and data structures.

Each week or two (depending on length of previous lesson and my schedule) I will post a new lesson, exercises, and solutions from the previous week. I will also answer questions and help out however I can.

If have questions or concerns let me know.",,False,self,t5_2rqj9,True,,,True,t3_pzgjk,http://www.reddit.com/r/UniversityofReddit/comments/pzgjk/interest_check_introduction_to_programming_with_c/,

We managed to renew the domain for another 2 years before it went back on the market, so we don't have to fight anyone to keep it.

But you're probably wondering ""How on earth could it have gotten to this point?"" Well, let me explain. Back in May of 2010 when the University of Reddit was just getting started, I was brought on as a mod and bought universityofreddit.com so get a preliminary website going. At the time it was basically a place to see what classes were offered, and a way for instructors to list classes they wanted to teach. It was pretty crude, and being new at web development, it was taking a long time. A little while later we welcomed anastas to the team who had more experience with web development, so he mostly took over in that department.

At this point it didn't make any sense for me to keep universityofreddit.com in my own portfolio, so we created a bogus email account with Yahoo, and used that account to register a joint godaddy account just for this one domain. That way, if anyone needed to make modifications to the domain, they could do so. Additionally, if I ever left uofreddit, I wouldn't be taking the domain with me. It just seemed like the most logical solution.

Fast forward to now. Everyone has been going about their lives, and the domain has slowly reached its expiration date. Normally godaddy sends out reminders and notifications that the domain is expiring, but nobody was checking the email because it was only used for this one purpose. Additionally, the password for the godaddy account *and* the yahoo email account was buried in a pile of my own personal emails. After about an hour of searching through various messages and lots of trial and error, I managed to find the password, and renew the domain.

Luckily, around the time anastas joined us, he had the foresight to register both ureddit.com and uofreddit.com, which were both up and running throughout this little hiccup.

Furthermore, I'm going to make sure that all emails sent to that bogus Yahoo account get forwarded to me so this doesn't happen again.

Not sure how I will be breaking each class up in terms of time/content, but hopefully will put this together over the next couple weeks.  Glad there is so much interest!

EDIT 3 (8-29-11):  Work has been quite busy but I hope to have some of the first lessons up during September.  If anyone would like to help, feel free to message me.

EDIT 4: (9-18-11): Creating new post to flesh out the ideas for how the course will work.  Not sure how the tutorials should be set up.  Some ideas are:

- Completely based in Excel spreadsheet with logical flow of teachings with in-sheet examples.
- Web-based lesson outline/explanation with example spreadsheets and screenshots to explain.
- Video based tutorials with step-by-step instructions leading through the process as a teacher would in a class.
- Some combination of the above techniques.

I'd also spend some time on culture and lifestyle.  So, if anyone's interested, let me know and I'll start working on it.  And I'm definitely open to suggestions for course material if there's something you'd want to do or learn.

As for my credentials, I'm a college student majoring in German and Russian, and I lived in Germany for a semester in high school.  Many Germans are surprised when I tell them that I am not a native speaker, so it shouldn't be a problem that I'm not.  I'm not infallible, though, so just a warning!  I plan on teaching as a professor, so this is something that I'd find quite fun.  I have teaching experience as a teacher's aid in high school, one-on-one English lessons with three different students in Prague and also as guest lecturer in an English course for foreigners at a high school in Prague.

**EDIT:** Alright, so I tried to record a video (since someone requested a soundbite), since I don't know where I would upload the soundbite on the internet, and my program is really weird (ManyCam) and I had a hard time getting it to work.  So... does anyone have suggestions for a program to record?  Or somewhere to upload the soundbite?

1273541352.0,96,self.UniversityofReddit,c2d8h,[CLASS] Game Theory 101,102,6,124,http://www.reddit.com/r/UniversityofReddit/comments/c2d8h/class_game_theory_101/,"I have extensive experience with game theory. I'm currently a professional economist, who uses game theory in the business setting (along with other fun stuff that I do). 

I read that a number of people are interested in game theory, and so I thought I'd offer a class. Since I have experience, a number of the topics I'll be teaching in will be fairly practical/real-life based. I've registered the class on the right, and if anyone's interested, just reply to this thread.

I have no idea how to run this yet, but I think Doodle and Tokbox would be used.

EDIT: If anyone has any suggestions on how this should be run, please tell me. In my opinion, it should be a system where you can see the slides, and hear my voice, and I can hear you in return

EDIT2: Please reply with your suitable days. I'm in Australia, and I do sleep late. Classes are typically 1 hour

**The plan thus far**

I think we shall start next week. I will need some time to go thru some lesson plans. I think I will structure it into a 6-week course, so over the course of 12 hours or so, we shall go thru these things (mostly in order):

* Intro to Game theory (do you want the boring history?)
  * Rational Choice theory
  * What the frak is a game?
* Nash equilibriums 
  * Backward induction (I hope this will be covered in the intro, but I doubt it, since no lecture I've been to actually managed to cover this)
  * Domination (or submission for those of you who are BDSM-inclined)
  * Best response functions
* Examples of Nash equilibriums in 2-player games
  * Prisoner's Dilemma
  * One card stud poker
  * Cournot and Bertrand's oligopolies
  * Why didn't US and Russia launch nukes at each other during the Cold War
* Representing games
  * Normal form
  * Extensive form
* More examples of Nash equilibriums in n-player games
  * Introduction to SPNEs
  * Perfect information auctions
  * Ultimatum game/Dick (tator) game/Holdup game
  * Stackleburg's duopoly
  * Winning an Election - I might talk about why Ron Paul never stood a chance, but it depends if I can find the notes I made a few years back (or whenever the election was held)
* Repeated game theory
  * Brief introduction to other forms of equilibriums, notably monomorphic and polymorphic equilibriums (and various other evolutionary equilibriums)
  * Repeated PD
  * Case study of the cereal industry
  * Are we good by nature?

I think I'll end here. You'll notice I didn't include games of imperfect information. I debated with myself whether to put in stuff like Bayesian games (I have a mancrush on Rev. Bayes (and von Neumann)), or stuff like signalling and coalitional games. I decided that in the timespan that we're going to do this (plus I don't think I can hold a 25-strong audience for long, since I am known to drone on and on when talking about GT). 

Of course, the imperfect information games are the ones I most frequently use at work, so I might be under some contract to not give examples of what I do. So in summary, I won't be doing imperfect information games, bayesian games, evolutionary stable strategies (I'm writing a paper on that), and stuff that mainly deals with a lot of microeconomics, like the Core. I do, however, understand that these are the most interesting parts of game theory (and I went into economics because of that), so, I be glossing thru them, but won't go into them in detail. I also personally have a lot of interests in arbitration, but I think to most people it's a dry topic, so I won't go into it.

I think with the lesson plan I have, I would be able to give the most practical examples and illustrations without going into too many wooly theories (sorry, Bounded Rationality people, no offence meant). Also, with a lot of the newer stuff with regards to matching games (you know, Al Roth and friends), I won't be teaching, and will be left up to the reader as an exercise

They will be in Game Theory 202 though (yes, there is a plan to extend this if this is well received).

Thank you all for expressing interest in the course, this post is an update to what has happened over the past week. Also, just a reminder, Signup has begun, and lectures will be posted at end of September! 

**(Signup at Ureddit.com)**

We are making amazing progress in terms of the number of students that have joined the course, the number of teachers (and with the qualifications of the teachers) and the kind of subjects (modules) that we are going to be running, and we will soon have a name for the class (we are open to suggestions though; currently we are thinking of BioLearn).

**Currently our group consist of:**

1. **20 teachers (8 are a part of teams conducting cutting edge research)**

2. **12-13 modules (Which the syllabus and lecturer responsible published soon!)**

3. **A student studying psychology who is going to be helping us ensure a good student teacher relation, teacher admin relation and who is also going to be helping us with teacher recruitment.**

We are currently in the process of writing curriculums for the modules and recruiting more students. If you have any friends, who this class could potentially help, please do redirect them to us.

If there are any questions pertaining to anything please feel free to comment on this post (and once we have a name; we will have an email ID that you could write to).

**Below are more of what we are offering, remember this has been forming over the last month, a lot has happened and we are a very large group so please be patient!**

-------------

**Hello all,**

I am doing this due to several reasons:

1. Personally to improve my English, teaching and communication skills, I wish to become a lecturer in the future, and this would be great on a CV too!

2. I am here because I would love to share some knowledge regarding what a lab life entails (as I believe it is not told to us properly at any stage of university/high school, leading to terrible assumptions of how science works and much more.)

3. To part my understanding of what I have read on articles, lectures and much more to people who are interested. I respect those who wish to learn, and understand. (Also to keep articles for those who wish to understand current affairs more accessible)

-----------

**What are we offering:**

I and several of my colleagues will be each individually teaching separate parts of this course. We have split the courses offered into 2 distinctive groups, Basic and Advance; Basic is high school (Sixth Form) level and up, whilst advanced contains more research and current affairs for college level upwards.

**The Basics:**

1. **Genetics/Biology**
2. **Neuroscience**
3. **Biochemistry**
4. **Chemistry**
5. **Mol/Cell Biology**

**The Advanced:**

1. **Subset of neuroscience**: (**including neuro-imaging, neuro-cellbiology, computational neuroscience and more!**)
2. **Biochemistry**
3. **Mol/Cell Biology**

-------------
**How will the course be operated?**

I would give probably **10 minute video** lectures at a time for the basics, with some critical reading material (relating to how the field started/latest research on the field.)

Thing to note about 10min videos, it will be condensed, so don't be disappointed if it weren't a 20 hour course per month (That is a massive amount of hours! :O) as I am sure the 10minute videos will be a lot in itself!
As far as which courses will be taught first, I think the basics of genetics and neuroscience first (or other per-requisites), then I/we will slowly start integrating current affairs and other courses. 

**Tutor groups will also be held in a subreddit** for students to discuss among themselves with possible lecturer to jump in and steer them in the right direction for each video session.

**Research talks** I aim to bring in people from different labs to talk about their work once most basic concepts have been taught, relating concept with research material, these will happen as one off 10 minute talks.

-------------

**What makes us difference from generic Youtube videos online?**

So some people have personally asked me what difference is this compared to some of the Youtube clips already online? Well, there are three parts to this question I like to mention:

1. Typically the Youtube videos are quite scattered, it would be nice to organize it into a condensed form in one location, easy to browse and find.

2. It will be tailored to make it an access course for complete beginners to (and this is the crucial part) understand current research and affairs, making it much more understandable how research works and why they are doing what they are doing.

3. Final is to add relevant reading material (current, and old), such as understanding the reading material (if it were old material).

-------------

Final note: In no way am I senior researcher etc, I state again I am an undergraduate Neuroscience student, but I am happy to learn and part as much of what I have learned to anyone who is interested, both for your gain and mine, this is also a learning curve for me, and a great opportunity!

A couple of weeks ago you all asked if there was a way that we could honor Aaron Swartz as a result of the unfortunate news. We then selected several amazing candidates that have offered their time and willingness to participate in the world of open education, and then had you all vote for who was most deserving of our first annual award. The results are in, and the following individuals have been chosen, with one receiving the first annual Swartz Award for Open Education.

**Awardee of the Swartz Award for Open Education**

/u/sarevok9 - He previously taught an amazing course [Introduction to C++: A video guided tutorial](http://ureddit.com/class/23620/introduction-to-c----a-video-guided-tutorial) that has nearly pulled in 6,300 students. More recently he has been working on his other course, [Introduction to Java: A video guided tutorial](http://ureddit.com/class/23649/) that has pulled in nearly 4,300 students.

We could not agree more that sarevok9 has done a fantastic job of contributing to the advancement of open education by sharing their knowledge. For this we are happy to award him with some reddit gold, and once we get final approval to print UReddit stickers we will be sending some his way.

**Runner-Ups**

/u/tanknspank for their [Cooking for one](http://ureddit.com/class/23631/cooking-for-the-single-life) course.

/u/hearforthepuns for introductory [course on electronics](http://ureddit.com/class/23587/electronics).

/u/Aznable for the [3D game art course](http://ureddit.com/class/29566/introduction-the-3d-game-art-)

Lastly, /u/chrunchy. For without their tireless efforts as a moderator we would be overrun by spam.

From all of us at UReddit, we want to thank each of you (both students and teachers) for contributing to the open education ecosystem. While we know traditional education is incredibly important, there is no boundary or limit to what you can learn. WIth open education and your contributions we want to help ensure this continues to happen, regardless of your pursuit of education to be about Dwarf Fortress or nuclear reactor physics.

We’ll bring this back each December to select one particular individual who has helped us contribute the most to the open education world.

With that in mind, here are four categories for /r/UniversityofReddit's ""Best of 2012"" awards.

* Best Overall Teacher
* Best Overall Class

If people like it I can do Early Roman Empire, Biology, Chemistry, Math (up to multivarible Calc and differential equations), etc., if there's interest.

Also, wrote most of the first lesson and I think I'll stop after the Battle of Actium (not first lesson), in 31 BC, instead of 24 BC, because I think its a better ending point, otherwise I start getting into the Empire's story.

With the interest in Quake and other F2P games, I'll probably have an individual lesson on each game (multiple for TF2).

Some games I'm not really qualified to give you in-depth information, for example I don't know the best timed path to take around certain maps on Quake, but I know the mechanics and have enough experience, and most importantly enough friends that are highly competitive in those types of games, to give you an introduction into the core skills and ideas behind games like Quake as well.

First one will certainly be an introduction to FPS games in general and explaining the variations within the genre, and how some skills overlap and others do not at all.


------------------


Yeah, it's not going to help you get a job, but whenever a new game comes out there are always a lot of posts about people wanting help learning the basics.

About myself- I've been playing FPS games since they came out, starting with Wolfenstein 3D and then Doom 1 and 2.

For modern FPS and competition- 

**Competed in** 

* Counter Strike 1.3, 1.5, 1.6. I was CAL M before there was a CAL P.
* Counter Strike Source
* Call of Duty
* Call of Duty United Offensive
* Call of Duty 2
* Call of Duty 4
* Call of Duty Black Ops
* Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3
* Halo 1 on Xbox (very shortly in a few tournaments)
* Was trained by zEx member, youngest CAL I champion for CS 1.3 and CPL founder Aaron ""DreadAssault"" Game.
* Was on team GDEC with Gladiator for Call of Duty 1 and some of 2
* Trained with Swedish CS Team ""Hammer""

Most recently took 2nd place on the PSGN CoD Black Ops Hardcore SnD ladder, and my team IIWII was the #1 team in 6 ladders, and top 3 in Every Single ladder for Black Ops on PSGN and TWL.

The most recent event was taking 2nd place in TWL's MW3 SnD launch tournament.




As for the class itself I had planned to make a series of tutorial videos already, those are planned out and would be my lesson plan. It'll start out from the very basics of individual tactics like clearing a room or even approaching a window, branch into forming your team, what players to look for, how to set up a strategy, how to evaluate a map, and creating and executing strategies. I will also cover a lot of the thought pattern behind a player and how to think a situation through to play smarter than your opponent.

This will be primarily Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3, but I will also bring up Counter Strike maps and UT2K4 / Q3 maps. I will be covering Search and Destroy game modes mostly, but will branch off into Capture the Flag and other modes. This information is rather universal so it will apply to most games, and the foundation is a lot of real life infantry tactics so it could be used in Airsoft or paintball. I'd get actual military training though instead of this for real life, obviously.

Method would be a weekly Youtube video posted on the topic. Questions could be posted on some method, probably either a google group or I'll create a subreddit for this. Questions would also be answered via a video to demonstrate the answer. If not that then I'd answer via post.

If you think any subreddit would be interested in seeing this, feel free to cross-post.",,False,self,t5_2rqj9,True,,,True,t3_obhvv,http://www.reddit.com/r/UniversityofReddit/comments/obhvv/interest_check_intro_to_competitive_fps_gaming/,

The course will have a Linux focus, but the concepts we hope to teach will be ""posixly neutral"" as much as possible -- that means that many things you will learn should apply to Unixes such as FreeBSD, Mac OS X, or the like.

**Course Outline** (subject to change)

* A brief overview of Unix history and philosophy
* Installation pointers
* An introduction to the shell: basic commands, how to use pipes, etc.
* Filesystem concepts: the filesystem hierarchy, partitioning, Unix permissions and ACLs, mounting.
* sed and awk: powerful text processing programs.
* How a system brings itself up: bootloaders, init systems, services.
* Package management.
* Configuring X11 (i.e. hacking your xorg.conf).
* Others?
* Server administration topics.  This is sort of nebulous at this point, but might include topics such as: setting up a firewall, tcpwrappers, PAM, sshd.  If there is demand for a lesson on configuring another popular service (samba or httpd) that could be included as well.

This is my first time teaching a course and I believe zenhack's as well.  We want to people to learn, so please do provide feedback on how we can best accomplish that.

**This course will require you to take your learning into your own hands.**  The most important thing to learn if you want to use or administrate a Unix system effectively is that you know to find solutions to problems.  If you take away one thing from this course, it should be that.  That being said, we are certainly here to help and answer questions but we will push you to learn this very important skill.

Zenhack and I have decided not to mandate the use of a particular distribution for the purposes of this course.  I feel that I can confidently answer questions pertaining to Arch Linux, Red Hat-based distributions (Fedora, CentOS), and Debian-based distributions (Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint).

I will leave it to zenhack to describe what he is comfortable helping people with but my list should give you a fairly wide selection.  :-)

Prerequisites: we assume that you are not afraid to tinker with your computer.  You should feel comfortable performing on operating system installation (you will need Linux for this course anyway, right?)  You can, of course, install Linux in a virtual machine (see [VirtualBox](http://www.virtualbox.org)) if you don't want to take any risks.

Delivery of the class will be primarily textual.  I would be open to voice chat or other methods if they seem helpful.

**The first lesson should be posted Friday, July 8 in the [IntroToUnix subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/introtounix).**

**kdorf's qualifications**

* Computer science undergraduate (senior)
* Linux systems administrator professionally (three years)

**zenhack's qualifications**

* Bachelor's in CS
* 2+ years employment experience as a system administrator (using RHEL + ubuntu)
* Been using the system as my primary OS for five years
* Some experience maintaining a distro
* Experience with other unix-like OSes, such as the BSDs

I think that about covers it.  You can leave questions here or submit them via e-mail.

Hello! Following up on this request:

http://www.reddit.com/r/UniversityofReddit/comments/w604o/request_introduction_to_screenwriting/

I would like to formally offer an Introduction to Screenwriting class and was wondering how many people might be interested. The class, as I envision it, will consist of about 8 video tutorials/lectures, each uploaded to youtube, and will follow a structure something along the lines of this:

Part 1: Types of Scripts

Part 2: Feature Screenplay Formatting

Part 3: Software – CeltX

Part 4: Software – Final Draft

Bonus: Software – Scrivener

Part 5: Screenplay Structure

Part 6: Important Tips

Bonus: Basic A/V Script Formatting

Part 7: Additional Resources (or maybe something else with which to end)

(The lesson list isn't set in stone right now, and I'm not certain about the bonus lessons: those will depend on the interest.)

I was also thinking it might be a good idea to give an optional assignment to those enrolled of writing a short script up to 5 pages in length (not including the title page.) You could then email me your script and I'd provide feedback on it or—if preferred—we could do some sort of group feedback if there's a practical enough way to do so.

Please feel free to post a response if you're interested, if there are any lessons you'd be interested in seeing (but keep in mind this is an introductory class,) and if either of those bonus lessons might be of interest to you. Thanks!

_________

Edit: I'm glad to see this is a popular topic! It looks like this would be a good class to start with, so I'll be making this for certain. I would, however, like to know how many of you might be interested in the class covering A/V scripts (these are used for commercials and other industrial videos—never for narrative features) and how many might be interested in covering Scrivener. Scrivener, it should be noted, is not built solely for screenplays. Final Draft is the industry standard and if you're going to pay for your screenwriting software, that's what I'd suggest you use. But I mention Scrivener because I figure some of those interested in this class are writers of novels, flash fiction, or other literature and may already have Scrivener and be more comfortable with it.

CeltX is listed because it's free. If you don't have Scrivener already, I'd suggest getting CeltX until you're certain you want to write features—after which you should probably buy Final Draft. For A/V scripts, you can also use CeltX or the dedicated A/V script software, Final Draft AV (not the most creative name, I know.)

A couple of commenters note that they've written scripts before. If you've written scripts, if you know standard formatting and how to use your software, and if you know structure: this class isn't really going to be useful for you. This is an *introductory* class. It's for those who are completely new to screenwriting and will only cover the basics. If the class is well received and if I can finish it up before a shoot I have this fall, then I will definitely be offering more classes. As mentioned here:

http://www.reddit.com/r/UniversityofReddit/comments/w604o/request_introduction_to_screenwriting/

Some of the other classes I could do include ""Videography, Use of Filters in Film and Video, Pulling Focus on a Motion Picture Camera, and other things related to film and video production, pre-production, and post production."" And I'm sure a more advanced Screenwriting course would be helpful to some as well—probably a Writing the Feature Film course or something of the like.

A couple people here were interested in what I do or what my background is. I'm not trying to turn this post into an ad for myself, but in case you're curious: I studied film production at 2 art universities in the US and worked for 3 school summers at a production company and post house in Washington, DC. I later did video marketing for a Century21 company covering most of the DC area, Northern Virginia, and Southern Maryland and shot weddings on weekends. I ICed (worked as an independent contractor) for a number of corporate marketing companies, doing videography primarily in the DC and New York areas and did Director of Photography work whenever I could find it, shooting a couple independent documentaries, a TV pilot, and recording live performances for a few small DC area theaters. I recorded referendums and events held by the Government of South Sudan in DC, primarily for a non-profit helping build schools between the two Sudans (this was prior to South Sudan's full independence) and was the only videographer given full access to the funeral of Manute Bol (Manute worked very closely with them before his death. He was an extraordinary man, by the way, and my friend Matt is working on a documentary about him and his school building project which I'll gladly update you all about upon its release if anyone is interested.) I eventually decided I'd like to own my own video company, and so this year I started my production company in New Mexico. Our focus has been video marketing and logo design, however we are preparing to shoot our first feature this fall. By the way, New Mexico allows use of its state owned land for free for productions, which is why it's become one of the top states for filming lately. If you plan on shooting a western or anything featuring beautiful canyons, skies, and mesas, do consider shooting in New Mexico. I did not write the screenplay we're shooting—I am only the Director of Photography and a Producer on the film. However, I have written a few feature screenplays, one of which will be my company's following feature production. One of the services my company also offers is screenplay coverage—which is where writers send their scripts to get notes and feedback about how they can improve their structure, formatting, characters, etc. and which emulates studio notes on their script. We are not moving into solely shooting features as it isn't financially practical. So for at least awhile, we'll be mostly balancing marketing work with more creative work.

Sorry for the wall of text! Also if anyone is interested in other film and video related classes, I'd love to know what topics specifically you'd like to see.

CI focuses on generating emergent intelligence via brain-like learning, evolution and other nature-inspired processes (such as swarm intelligence, which will *not* be covered in this course).

For a taste of CI, take a look at [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBgG_VSP7f8). The creatures are evolved without human interaction!

In terms of uses for CI-techniques, they can be used in almost any situation but they are most suited to when traditional techniques (AI or otherwise) are not suitable. Tasks like creating bipedal robots, generating stock predictions or solving (ish) the travelling salesman problem.

**Syllabus** 

* Motivation
* Artificial neuron models
* Multi-Layer Perceptrons, Self-Organising Maps and Recursive Auto-Associative Memory
* Fixed-weight networks
* Genetic algorithms
* Incremental evolution
* Evolutionary optimisation and design
* Neuroevolution and coevolution
* Biotic and open-ended evolution

We will also cover influential research papers, such as Sims' *Blockies*, Rays' *Tierra* and Channon's *Geb* in order to illustrate ideas.

If this course is successful I will offer a more advanced CI course (echo state networks, liquid state machines, R2SP etc) sometime in the future.

Edit: I've just thought that I know some people who used CI techniques in their UG dissertations. I could ask them if they would be willing to do AMAs as well.

**Requirements/prerequisites**

You need to be able to think in a computational/logical/mathematical way. If you're competent on a computer you'll be okay. Psych (and related) majors will be okay as well.

**Qualifications**

I'm a graduate student at the [University of Edinburgh](http://www.ed.ac.uk), and I recently graduated with a 1st in Computer Science (during which time I was a TA for 2 years).

**Update**

I'm not convinced that there's enough interest to make this worthwhile. That combined with the fact that I'm going to be very busy over the next year or so means I won't be running the course. I'll think about running different courses though, and I may run this at some point in the future.

Overview: I will start off by introducing my self and letting you all know that I'm not professional. I make mistakes, have fun, and keep up the work in hopes to be a professional. I think this is a great hobby and more people should get into it. You will learn how to ""Beatmatch"" than you will learn how to transition with ""Beatmatching""

Requirements: A feel for music is required. if you cant dance on beat i would recommend skipping this class. Your going to need any kind of Decks, CDJ, Vinyl, or PCDJ hardware + midi controller + software. I honestly do not recommend DJ'ing with just software it feels annoying and it can be hard to drag a mouse without a steady hand.

I Will consider after 30+ upvotes and 10 + approval comments otherwise i will just pass by. 

Remember this is just the basics do don't expect to learn how to EQ and use effects properly. Those things are hard but Beatmatching is going to be your bread n butter.

EDIT: I was not expecting this much support. I will go ahead and see about setting up a curriculum. We will be working with Electronic music as it is much easier to mix than other Genre's.  I think i may be able to get all of this started around mid nov or end of dec to allow for more time for people and my self. 

If you have requests let me know and i will do my best to try and incorporate it.

edit: 
Hey guys, for those who are unsure, it is learnable; according to pretty much any speed reading source I've found. However I think the hard bit is to break old reading habits. So even though it seems simple enough to just read faster and generally what eye movements involved in speed reading, it's difficult to perform while remembering anything you look over.

So I guess I was more interested in a good sort of tutor of speed reading to teach techniques and work through the problems in breaking regular reading habits and give tips to gain reading speed.

I'm looking to see if anyone would be interested in the higher-level topics and their applications. Finance and Game Theory are also introduced, as they are of interest to many people.

Topics would include:

**1. Utility**

* Theories and functions &amp; the implied demand curves
* Application to the insurance industry and welfare economics (how to maximize a society's happiness)

**2. Production and Cost of Production**

* Models of capital, labor, rent, and wages
* The implied supply curves

**3. Theory of the Market**

* Price, Marginal Cost, Returns to Scale, and Incentives to Innovate 
* Perfect Competition, Monopoly, Oligopoly

**4. Inter-temporal Choice**

* Mathematical models about how we discount the future
* The decision making process of a firm seeking to pursue projects
* Bonds and their prices (corporate bonds, treasury bills)
* A model of stock prices (the dividend discounting model)
* Case Study: Should we act on the climate change warnings? How tiny details in discounting makes the government sponsored economic studies worth less than they seem (this is a general consensus, not my interpretation).

**5. Introduction to Finance**

* What is Finance and how does it help society?
* History of Finance (important to understanding today's situation)
* The Market Efficiency Debate

**6. Finance Models**

* Stock Prices Revisited (the Capital Asset Pricing Model and the Arbitrage Pricing Model. Hint: You get to use the beta for stocks published in Google Finance, and learn the basic tools traders use)
* Options and Futures. What functions do they serve? How are options priced and what do they tell us about the future? How are futures priced and what do they reveal?
* Hedging, Hedge Funds, and building a Portfolio of Investments

**7. Introduction to Game Theory**

* The Prisoner's Dilemma
* The Mathematical Formulation
* Repeated Games
* Oligopolistic Pricing and Production
* Auction Theory

I picked those topics either because they are important and interesting when applied, or because they're so fundamental that topics later on would require them. Feel free to suggest other microeconomics topics you wish to learn about (Theory of Optimal Taxation, Externalities, a more in-depth look at Welfare Economics, Contract Theory, etc.), or tell me what's not interesting (I'm not sure about #2, for example). I'll compile a syllabus based on the responses.

If you took the factseyejustmadeup's 4 week microeconomic class, highschool/AP Economics, a first year general economics class, or learned the basics of microeconomics from other channels you should be fine. I'll go over the concepts you should know to refresh your memory, but it may be too fast if you've never been exposed to the ideas before (although you can always self study the basics needed as we move along). Knowledge of calculus, though not required, will be helpful. A full derivation of a few topics will need multivariable calculus and linear algebra, but that's only a small section and not really needed to follow along. You should, however, be very comfortable with graphs, functions, and algebra.

Let me know if there's any interest! I can do one lecture/week. It'ld be helpful to include your economic/mathematic background.

Edit: Looks like the class is a go! Thanks for all the interest. I'll be working on building a syllabus (please continue to tell me your background and suggestions so I can figure out what to include), and will start the class once I get it and a significant number of lectures written out (I guess I'll have notify you guys then by replying to all your comments?)",,False,self,t5_2rqj9,True,,,True,t3_d9iha,http://www.reddit.com/r/UniversityofReddit/comments/d9iha/offer_intermediateadvanced_microeconomics_with/,

You choose the size.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Learn the fundamentals of composition, learning to care for your materials, color theory, preparing your surface, and techniques. By the end of the course each student should complete one fully formed abstract work! Wooo, anyhow, we will cover only the very basics of drawing in the realm of composition. It's best if you have some idea of how to draw but not necessary. That's why I've chosen an abstract work as the main project. 

Each week will have an assignment and a discussion in the forums. I will review your work and give you tips and direction. You are welcome to also post your work for discussion with your fellow students.

This would include nomenclature, basic analysis of organic molecules, some common organic reactions, and a beginning of synthesis.  I would try to update three days a week with powerpoint lectures and voiceover that matches with the slides.  I would also try to hold live discussion sections twice a week to answer your questions and work on example problems.  I will also assign suggested practice problems to help with your understanding.

The course would require a basic understanding of general chemistry, but I will describe relevant concepts if there is a need.  A basic understanding of math would also be helpful.  I could also throw together a gen. chem. review for those of you who are a bit rusty.  I suppose I could offer an accelerated gen. chem. course that leaves out aspects that are not required for organic chem, as well.

There will be a lot of material to cover, so I expect the course to last at least 15 weeks.  We can slow down the speed of the lectures as well, if it is going too fast.  I am hoping to start in the next 2 weeks.

I will also try to come up with simple examples/experiments that you will be able to do at home.  I can't make any promises on this one, most organic chemistry requires a laboratory setting.

Neutron physics is the study of the travel of neutrons through matter and the resulting reactions, most notably power generation via the fission of nuclei of heavy atoms, i.e. nuclear reactor cores.

- **Syllabus :**



Information is available on the [dedicated website](http://nuclearreactorphysics.weebly.com/index.html)

I strongly recommend that you ckeck out this website, but here are the main information anyway :

- The class will start on **January 19, 2013**.

- The class material (lectures, homework) will be uploaded [there](http://nuclearreactorphysics.weebly.com/index.html).

- It will also be linked on this very page, as well as in the [dedicated subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/NeutronPhysics).

- A message will let you know of any update.

- [Planning &amp; Syllabus (subject to changes)](http://nuclearreactorphysics.weebly.com/planning.html)

- [FAQ](http://nuclearreactorphysics.weebly.com/planning.html)



As of today, I am still working on the website. New sections will probably be added. If you have any suggestion, please do not hesitate to contact me.


- **Prerequisites :**

I am listing two prerequisites for this class.

The first one, and the more important to my mind, is the University of Reddit course [""Nuclear and Radiochemistry""](http://ureddit.com/class/68701/nuclear-and-radiochemistry)

I recommend to read through at least chapter 4. While you could possibly do without, it goes over very useful and interesting stuff.

The second one is also a University of Reddit class, [""Ordinary Linear Differential Equations""](http://ureddit.com/class/67558/ordinary-linear-differential-equations---matrix-differential-equations-).

Even though it is not an absolute requirement (I will go over the mathematics you need to know in this class), it will make things easier.


Note that it can be done in parallel, you don't have to complete the prerequisites before taking this class. I will anyway happily answer any question you may have.

- **Additional information :**

Please, please do not hesitate to ask question, to give ideas and suggestions, and to tell me if you are having difficulties. The main reason why I only post lectures every other week is so that you have time to work on the homework without pressure. There are no deadlines anyway, don't worry. Refer to the  [FAQ](http://nuclearreactorphysics.weebly.com/planning.html) for more information.

The other reason why I will post lectures only every other week is that it takes a lot of time and I have a lot of things to do. It may happen that I fall behind, in which case I will let you know (i will do my best so that it doesn't happen).

I set up a subreddit, r/NeutronPhysics. I recommend you to use it to post questions, discuss problems, ask for help, etc. Havingan active student community makes everything more fun and help boost your motivation.

If you emailed/messaged me and that I did not answer at all within two days, please re-send your message (maybe using another mean).


I really hope you will enjoy this class.

*EDIT:* Wow, I'm really impressed with the response. Okay, let's do this. I'll start working on a course outline after work tonight and should have some more info very soon.

Would there be any interest in a course on this? I've been working as a professional journalist, primarily as a writer, for almost six years now. I still consider myself fairly new to the field, and I'm not so vain as to presume I have some great insights into the skills of my profession. But I do feel like I've picked up some techniques, tricks and ideas during my career that Redditors may find interesting and useful. 

Areas I would focus on: 

• Some basic background as well as the current state of the industry.

• Why you should be a journalist, even if it's not your job.

• Choosing a subject to report on, probably some in-class story idea brainstorming.

• Finding sources and getting them to talk to you (I have a few idea for some exercises involving this).

• Interviewing tips; what to ask and how to ask it.

• Putting it all together and getting it out there to the world.

If there's sufficient interest, I think I could cover this in a 3-4 week course.

Anyone can be a journalist, and everyone should be a journalist. Even though I'm a ""professional,"" that primarily means someone gives me money to do my job. That's a very nice thing to have (and I am not volunteering to work for free, just in case my editor is reading this), but not a prerequisite to doing good journalism in my book (though it certainly helps).",,False,self,t5_2rqj9,True,,,True,t3_jr80m,http://www.reddit.com/r/UniversityofReddit/comments/jr80m/interest_check_journalism_basics/,

For those of you who may be interested in starting your own blog, on your own domain, and while only using pocket change this four part class will be for you.

[U of R Class Registration and Info here](http://ureddit.com/c28958). I won't be using eventbrite this time or newsletters, so please add the course on there.

Session 1- [Choosing a topic, creating an editorial calendar, and finding a community](http://play-this.org/2012/04/11/blogging-101-choosing-a-topic-creating-an-editorial-calendar-and-finding-a-community/).

Session 2 - [Selecting the domain/host provider and blogging content management system (CMS) that best suits you](http://play-this.org/2012/04/18/blogging-101-selecting-the-best-platform-for-you/)

Session 3 - Tips from a bad ass blogger, [The Realistic Nutritionist](http://nutritionfor.us/). *I built my wife's site and got her started, but she has excelled beyond even my own work. With a ridiculous amount of followers, Facebook fans and site views, she can provide some insight on how to make your blog count.*

Session 4 - How to market your blog, and not be a spamming D-bag.

At the beginning of the year I created the intro to [online communities and community management class](http://www.reddit.com/r/UniversityofReddit//comments/psndf/update_final_online_communities_101_course_tonight/) that did quite well, and I have a background in journalism, marketing and web development. If you all would be interested just throw an upvote at this post or leave a comment. Feel free to leave topic suggestions as well and I can include them in the sessions.

As per last time I will use Live Stream so they will be recorded, and the sessions will last around 30 minutes. Half presentation/lecture and half open for questions. 

**Update** First class will be on Wednesday, April 11 from 4 p.m. EST until around 4:30. I will send out a message from Ureddit later today.

Would anyone be interested in a class which presents the basic concepts of fluid mechanics?  This would involve basic derivations of static and dynamic equations.  It would be a basic introduction to one of the most complicated areas of scientific and mathematic research today, and as such a decent grade in high school (or A level or Bacc) maths would be a pre-requisite (although I may be convinced into teaching the background maths as well - I have yet to decide).

For now, please post a comment if interested (or just downvote me to oblivion - your choice)

**Edit:** Blimey, people seem really interested!  OK, I'll try and get some notes and stuff together, and I think I'll have a shot at this!  ONWARDS!

Re: mathematics.  Essentially you will need a good grasp of algebraic calculus (including partial derivatives and double integrals).  Vector calculus will NOT be required.  Tensor algebra will NOT be required.

The topics that would be covered would be typical of a college freshman level course. However, we will be going over some advanced material from supplemental textbooks that may require a basic understanding of calculus.

To go a bit more in depth, the topics covered would include basic quantum mechanics, molecular theories, properties of gases, properties of solids and liquids, thermodynamics, equilibria, acids and bases, electrochemistry, descriptive inorganic chemistry and a few other topics. 

There are no prerequisites per se, but as was mentioned before, a knowledge of basic calculus and physics will help in understanding some more advanced topics we will be covering.

You'll also find testimonials from all my students (meaning all of the ones who took the trouble to post a testimonial) at the bottom of the post.

This differs slightly from UoR in that my classes are always one-on-one. I will teach in a manner tailored to your requirements and capabilities.

**My classes are completely free and there is no minimum requirement of knowledge.** I didn't mention the cost (or lack thereof) in my original post in RandomKindness, because it never occurred to me that people might think I was just avoiding the topic of cost, but after someone asked how much I'd charge for classes, I thought I'll mention it up front. 

There is no set syllabus, because I will teach according to how you learn and what you want to learn. I've had classes that lasted 30 minutes, and I've had one class that lasted 3h 40m. One class switched from PHP/MySQL into a 30 minute explanation of how the internet (and web servers in particular) work, just because the student was a little unclear. You set the pace, except that I'll refuse to continue ahead until I'm sure you're comfortable with what we've already spoken about.

Even if you know nothing about computers beyond how to install Skype and sign in, I will teach you. I have a couple of students as young as 14, and one student who can't do voice chat because of hearing difficulties. I will put up with a lot of crap to teach you, as long as I think you want to learn. :D

Please keep in mind that while I can teach you how to convert something in your imagination into a webpage or an image, I cannot imagine things for you.

If you missed the previous post, you can [find details here](http://www.reddit.com/r/UniversityofReddit/comments/15kmc0/announcement_two_new_ureddit_offerings_book_club/), but the TL;DR is that each month we will select a book to read, break down the chapters into four sections, and have a weekly discussion about it on the UReddit subreddit. At the final week of discussions you all will get to suggest and vote for the next month’s book. The only requirement is that the book must be available in a digital version to make it easily accessible.

**January Selection: The Time Machine**
The book will be broken down into four sections, with four weekly discussions. Because the book is only 80 pages or so, it should be a very simple read and easy to keep up with the rest of the class.

**Discussion schedule**

**Class Launch:** Friday, January 4, 2013

**Read section 1:** Chapter 1-3 due by discussion 1.

**Discussion 1:** January 11

**Read section 2:** Chapter 4-6 due by discussion 2.

**Discussion 2:**January 18

**Read section 3:** Chapter 7-10 due by discussion 3.

**Discussion 3:** January 25

**Read section 4:** Chapter 11, 12 and epilogue due by discussion 4

**Discussion 4:** February 1 - Also suggest books for February’s selection due to start on February 8

I was wondering if anyone was interested in learning economics that is generally taught in an introductory course. Though I don't have my degree yet, I think I have enough under my belt to teach basic ideas from economics 101.

I want to do this because I believe there is a deficit in understanding of economics. It's so important to our daily lives as well as our politics.

If there's any interest in this topic, leave a comment or send me some upvotes (hopefully, that didn't sound like begging). I've been meaning to do this for some time. Hopefully many of you are interested!

edit:

So I'm very glad to see that there are a few people already interested!

Here are my thoughts so far:

Classes: If anyone has seen lessons on Khan Academy, I think I will try a similar format of roughly 10-12 minute videos (slightly longer, but same style) and maybe a 45minute-60minute session to do some sort of exercise related to the topic as well as time for questions and discussion. In terms of media, I think I'll use youtube for the videos and probably something like tokbox, or google hangouts for discussions.

In terms of frequency, I think I would be able to do 1-2 videos a week and 1-2 sessions a week. Videos will obviously be available online for people to view at any time. The sessions would be flexible where we could try something on Saturday and Sunday, which covers the same material for both sessions.

In terms of course material, I will plan on covering both micro and macro, but I will do them in succession. If you're looking for just macro, then you might have to wait since I plan on starting with micro first.

Unfortunately, until I have a solid lesson plan, this might still flop. Keep your comments and questions coming. This will help me set things up in my head as well!

Edit 2:

OKAY PEOPLE. I will do this. Next month, I will be drafting ""lesson plans"", figuring out how I will format lessons, and get everything set in place. TENTATIVELY, I hope to begin cranking out videos around the end of September.

Now, a few of you may have noticed there are two courses with nearly the same material happening concurrently. One of them is my course, and the other is McPants32's available [over here](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamegenome).

This is fine with me, and I'm not here to compete. However, I thought it might be a good idea to talk about the differences in the offered courses so any potential students will be able to choose one that best suits their need and interest.

McPants32's course has a much large scope than mine does. I believe he intends to cover both server and client side web development technologies. As a result of this, he has no syllabus and his course is ""ongoing"". The scope of my course is limited to HTML and CSS, and I have a syllabus listed of the topics I intend to cover, though I have also admitted it might change (and it has, a little bit) as the course progresses. My course will be over when those topics are covered. I am *not condemning McPants32's approach* -- there's nothing wrong with it.

McPants32's HTML and CSS tutorials so far are not as thorough as mine are, *however*, he has also said that his intention from the beginning was to push past them and spend more time on Javascript. If you are much more interested in the behavior/interaction programming side of web development, his will cover much more of that. HTML and CSS together provide the presentational part of a web page, so my course -- which is spending much more time on HTML/CSS -- is much more about designing a page than it is about programming its behavior. If you wish to be able to design a page using HTML/CSS, my course may be preferable. If you already know CSS, or don't care to know it enough to be a designer and just want to know it well enough to interact with it via Javascript, you may want to look at McPants32's course instead. If you really are interested in knowing both thoroughly, you may want to take both courses concurrently.

Another difference between our courses is the presentation. Mine is and will continue to be text-based, and McPants32 is moving to a video format. Each appeals to a different set of learners, so if you are still in the air about choosing between them, you can take this into consideration as well.

The last major difference I've noticed is that I have formalized an assignment system and McPants32 has not. That is, for each lesson, I give an assignment, and provide a thread to submit it. I 'grade' it by commenting on each submission and offering advice or corrections. I would not be surprised if McPants32 offered to do this as well if you posted your work in his subreddit, but I am actively encouraging (though not requiring) the submission of work. I believe that what UReddit has to offer that other standard web tutorials do not is feedback and interaction with the 'professor', and so I have focused heavily on providing that. That said, this is just how I have chosen to organize my course, and it may or may not be important to any given student.

I feel like I need to stress again that I am *not promoting my course and condemning McPants32's*. I designed my course in the way I would like to have taken it. So of course, I am going to be biased toward mine, and notice differences between mine and McPants32's that I don't care for, because if I *did* like his more, I would have done it his way. But that is my bias, and I recognize that my opinion is just my opinion. You personally may prefer the way McPants32 handles his course, and if you do, that's where you should go.

I will PM McPants32 myself and invite him to comment on this post as well. He can say if I have misrepresented anything about his course and give his own take on any differences. Anyone who has looked through both courses trying to decide which one they wanted is welcome to chime in as well, but *please, please, please* keep it objective and nice. Nobody is here to battle, we're just here to find the best fit for everyone.

Thank you for your patience with my wordiness :)

The team at UReddit is secretly cranking away at some new ways to better this community and our services, but until we are ready to announce that we have a two new offerings.

We at UReddit know that education doesn’t stop in the classroom, and with an education platform built upon the largest online community there are a lot of people to learn from. With that said, we would like to offer a few suggestions for making your classes and learning experiences better for all those involved. Before we highlight some basic information, we’re announcing two new offerings to UReddit:

**The monthly book club and discussion courses.**

**UReddit Book Club** The monthly book club will be an experiment/ trial for a weekly open discussion based on a book you all vote for. Each month we will select three books (they will be required to have a digital version available), post the options, and the most upvoted item will be the monthly book. We will break the book up into four sections, one for each week of the month. Each week we will then create a distinguished post (when the green mod text appears), and have an open discussion about that particular section. The final week in the month we will take in suggestions for the three new books to be voted on for the following month, and discuss the entire book as a whole. If URedditors find this to be a useful or worthwhile project, we will look at ways to expand it. 

&gt;I have posted three books as suggestions in the comments, so please upvote the one you would like to start with. They are all classics, and freely available on various app stores and on the Web; however, next month you all will be making the suggestions, and they can be newer selections.

**Discussion courses** are great for classes where there is a great demand for a subject, but unfortunately no teacher is available to create a class. While this won’t work for all types of subjects, a good example of a discussion based course would be an introductory philosophy course. The course will still need someone to lead the conversation, identify content that the class will read, and then discuss either in their subreddit or even a chat room of sorts. Keep in mind this sort of course will not be ideal for all subjects, and we will be launching a trial philosophy course to get things rolling before we open it to everyone. I will make another announcement next Friday with the offering.

**FAQ**


* Need help getting started? [Read our FAQ section](http://ureddit.com/help). 
* Want to create a class? [Here are some suggestions](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJskAtBQO0c). 
* And our open calendar of classes can [be found here](http://play-this.org/university-of-reddit-class-schedules/), but teachers need to let us know their schedule. Just message us to be added.

**Teaching a class:**

Are you a Narwhal hunter that can deliver content on a regular basis that can contribute to a new line of Narwhal hunters? If so, create your course and lesson plan on UReddit, then post it back to our subreddit. Keep in mind that teaching a class is no simple task, and it’s easy to bite off more than you can chew. In the future we will be launching a new way for you to teach, so having quality content will be in your favor later on. Also, to declutter this subbreddit, please don't post interest check posts here any longer. Just create the course on UReddit, with a completed lesson plan, then share it back here. You would also want to message the mods with your schedule so we can add it to the calendar.

**Taking a class:**
Taking a class is simple. Find a new offering on this subreddit, or go to UReddit.com and find a current class. Most classes have archived content either on their site, subreddit, or updates on this subreddit. If you can't find the course content, reach out to the teacher. The teachers are in complete control of their content, schedule, and material, so unless someone reports an inactive or empty course we may not see it. We do our best to clean content on a daily basis though.

**Requesting a class:**

Don’t see a class or one that does not have an archive of content? Request a new one! We have a specific subreddit for these, so be sure to go to /r/URedditRequests to request your class. We began doing this a few months ago when our platform doubled in membership, and we needed a way to organize new class content and requests better. If you don’t get a response or have not seen someone offer to create the course, keep in mind you are among millions of members on reddit. If there is a subreddit that relates to the course or subject you want to learn about, cross post your request and let them know you are interested. You may be the reason and inspiration that gets the course to start rolling. If all else fails, message the mods, and we will setup an open discussion course with you as we try out the new offering.

Have any other questions?

It has been a long time since I have posted. This is because we have all been hard at work, to produce you something amazing.

Lets just get the bad news out and over with: Since the last time I wrote out to you all, I said there were 20 Lecturers willing to help us teach Bio-Science education to all educational levels. Sadly 5 left us.

Now to the good news: Over the month, I and a few co-workers have been hard at work, to turn this little group into a organization. I decided, why not make this an organization to teach and promote bio-science education and research. 

And we did.

We have created an organization which we hope can self-sustain itself over the next few years, with rules, roles, structure all planned out.

Why not allow it to be a great experience for both the Lecturers and the students? We now offer Lecturers to gain solid work experience. Not only is the work experience applicable for Scientist, we need HR people, we need Marketing and Finance people and we need talented organizers who can think of a better future for this organization. 

We are aiming at people with little to no work experience, or undergraduates to join our team. We hope by doing so, the teaching side will be able to take care of itself, helping us teach a wide range of different Bio-science areas, exploring new research and old a-like.

I present to you, Bio-Amo. If you are interested, read the last paragraph below for more detail.

-----------------------
Anyway, I will get back to the teaching, as this is most interesting to UniversityofReddit, all courses will be published on the 7th October.

Need to revise a topic in or around Bioscience? want to delve into the world of biology for a possible future career path? or just interested?

By visiting our YouTube channel, you can easily and quickly browse through a number of different topics in and around Bioscience from high school upwards. We offer basic theoretical knowledge and current research with reading material if you wish to explore further!

It looks like there has been some interest in the past an Orgo class.  If anyone has followed through with it, please bring it to my attention... but I think this class would be kind of unique.

I do not have a BS yet, but I am a TA and teaching lab assistant for pre-med level orgo.  I am also heavily involved in synthetic research at my school.

The objective of the course would be to gain an overview of the majors typically covered in first semester organic chem (acid / base applications, basic orbital theory, key mechanisms, and major reagents).  **No previous chemistry experience is needed**.  I'm confident that, if you are a good listener and just like to pick up skills, you will be able to follow a conversation and workout out some synthesis problems on your own.  We could even cover some illegal drug chemistry ;)

The class would likely be about a dozen ten minute videos on a whiteboard or paper.

So chime in if this tickles your fancy.

Edit: I am really heavy on the analogies.  This makes me really unpopular with the pros, but I have a feeling the laymen could really benefit from learning by associations.

I wouldn't call myself a professional iOS developer (I treat it more like a hobby), but I do have [one app](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/kardball/id443299950?mt=8&amp;ls=1) on the app store if you would like to know what kind of skills I have.

Anyways, if you're interested in taking this class, there are a couple pre-requisites:

* some programming experience. Doesn't really matter what language.

* a computer running OS X Snow Leopard (or Lion, when it comes out next month; see below) with XCode 4 installed. (You might be able to use other IDEs, but I don't have any experience in that area, so no guarantees)

I'm thinking of publishing a few PDFs with class notes, and then making myself available to answer questions, or run through examples. I'll probably also assign you to watch some of the ""Getting Started"" videos on Apple's developer website as homework. The class will focus on using the frameworks to accomplish certain tasks, e.g. ""How do I create a tab bar based app?"" or ""What types of things can I do with a Table View?"" I won't be talking too much about the nitty-gritty aspects of Obj-C. Just enough to help you understand how the framework is structured; iOS development, as with programming for most platforms, is 80% frameworks anyway. (There was someone in the request post who was interested in topics like jailbreak detection. Sorry, but I don't know anything about that.)

There is one thing that I wanted to get an opinion on though: Since Lion releases next month, would it make more sense to start then? How many of you will definitely be upgrading on day 1? How many will definitely *not* be upgrading until at least a couple weeks have passed? The reason I ask, is because XCode on Lion (v4.1) is slightly different than XCode on Snow Leopard (v4.0.2). It has a couple little extra features, most of which you probably wouldn't notice anyway. Also, I have a *very good feeling* \*wink\* that XCode will be free on the Mac App Store for Lion when it ships (right now it's $5 on the Mac App Store, but you can still download XCode 3 from Apple's developer site for free).

Also, if we do decide to wait until Lion, I could use the time in between now and then to assemble some lesson plans and such.

Let me know what everyone thinks!

**Sign up at [course page](http://ureddit.com/class/86097/) and subscribe to the [course location](http://www.reddit.com/r/GreekLit/) if you are interested.**

______________________________________________________________________________________________


**Course Description**: The aim of this course will be to survey some of the main texts in ancient Greek literature (in English translation) and to discuss the cultural themes contained therein. I plan to offer around 15 weeks of guided reading and discussion while we read the following forms of literature: 1) Platonic dialogue, 2) Ancient Tragedy, 3) Ancient Comedy, 4) Lyric Poetry, 5) Epic Poetry, and 6) Historical Prose. Themes we will cover include irony, mythology, cosmogony, women in antiquity, ancient Greek athletics, Athenian democracy, ancient Greek warfare, heroism, and contemporary reflections on ancient culture.

**Prerequisites**: An interest in ancient Greek culture and literature are a must! Otherwise, all of these texts are available freely online, and I will recommend sources to purchase for further reading. Note that we will be reading these works in English translation, so I will assume little to no reading knowledge of ancient Greek.

**Qualifications**: I am currently an undergraduate student of Philosophy and Classics. I will be entering my senior year next semester, but I have already finished the coursework for my Classics major. I have plenty of experience with reading ancient Greek, so I can answer most questions concerning translation. Finally, I have tutored for two years, which should help me to provide adequate instruction.

**Schedule**: The course will start in one or two weeks if enough people are interested (hopefully around 10). I will post a document that explains the historical background and significance of each reading as well as a section-by-section commentary that explains otherwise confusing references to ancient Greek culture. I will also post discussion questions that will allow students to interact with one another while examining these texts in more depth.

Tentative Reading Schedule:

1. Plato on Poetry
2. Homeric Hymns
3. Hesiod - *Theogony* and *Works and Days*
4. Sophocles - *Oedipus Tyrannos* &amp; Aristotle on Tragedy
5. Aeschylus - *Agamemnon*
6. Euripides - *Medea*
7. Aristophanes - *The Frogs*
8. Aristophanes - *Lysistrata* &amp; Sappho (Lyric Poetry)
9. Lyric Poetry &amp; Pindar - *Olympian Odes*
10. Homer - Selections from *Iliad* and *Odyssey*
11. Herodotus - Histories
12. Plato - The Trial and Death of Socrates
13. TBA
14. TBA
15. TBA

Note: I am open to revisions of this schedule. I am covering the various forms of literature in broad strokes and have left out quite a bit.

Thanks for reading! Feel free to comment on any aspect of this course, and don't hesitate to express your interest!

Course can be altered and adjusted based on students' desire to learn more about a specific topic. 

**Update:8/20 @ 19:34** - OK, so it looks like a decent number of people are interested (16 comments as of this update). 

I'll prepare what I'm going to cover based on what I think you guys will find interesting and look into potential reading materials (which I of course will make freely available). I already know one book that I'm going to make required reading: *Theories International Politics and Zombies* by Dan Dreznor. 

If you guys are wondering about my qualifications, I have a BA in Political Science and a MS in International Relations from NYU. But that doesn't make me qualified. It's up to you guys to determine how qualified I am based on the quality of how well you're understanding what I'm talking about. So your input is not only welcome, it's essential. 

I would like to teach you guys a shit-load of IR 101 material but with this being an online class - and completely free and non-compulsory - I'll try to get in the basics (which can be boring and hard to comprehend at first) as quickly as possible in order to get to the fun stuff (e.g. why two-level game theory has become the de facto way in which international actors operate on the world stage). 

I'll begin to create a syllabus and from there create course notes that I'll make available to you guys. However, I don't know how long all that will take; I work long hours. So everything is TBD.

I created this subreddit for the course: http://www.reddit.com/r/IR101/

Future updates will be posted there. Please subscribe so that you know what's going on. Also, if you have tips, concerns, whatever, please post it in the subreddit. 

@Airaieus: Yes, conflict will be covered. Conflict, more specifically, avoiding conflict, is a major part of IR, in theory and in practice, so it will be covered extensively. 

@HouseintheMouse: Yup, I plan on covering current events by delving into the events' history; the effects of the actions taken by international actors that lead to the causes of the current state of affairs.

I've been doing hobby electronics for about 8 years now, and have taught a few friends and even my old High School physics teacher the basics of circuits and programming.  The course would be centered primarily around the Arduino development platform, but could move on to AVR programming.  Following is a general framework for the course:

Most of the units past
*Unit I-Basic programming architecture and jargon.
*Unit II-Arduino programming and statements(If, else, while, etc.)
*Unit III- Digital and Analog I/O
*Unit IV- Methods and Recursion
*Unit V- Serial Communication(Possible some Processing integration)
*Unit VI- Advanced Circuit Design(Potential big project)
*Unit VII- Intro to Assembly
*Unit VIII- Intro to AVR Programming

For the most part, I would try to limit any circuit parts to those that can be purchased at a local Radio Shack, especially near the beginning of the course(Some Radio Shacks even sell Arduinos).  I'm considering making up some homework, maybe even an exam or two, if the public would want it.  I'm also open to suggestions and ideas.  I'd like to even have a few lectures based off of questions the students ask.  I'm currently trying to figure out how to incorporate free software such as LTSpice into the course.

Please **do not** sign up if you haven't read the entire description.  These will be weekly **video** lectures.  If there is interest, classes will start September 6, 2010 and be posted every week following.

**Prerequisites**:


3-5 hours a week to dedicate to the class.  If you're not serious, don't sign up.

Programming in any high-level language.  I prefer Java, Python or C++, as I will be making references to it throughout the class, though the class will not be held in Python.  If you know what a for loop is  and how to use it in any language, you're as good as gold.

**Syllabus**:


1. What is game development, and what is involved in it?
2. A simple start: basic OOP.
4. Drawing to the screen, vertical synchronization, and anti-aliasing.. What are they, do we need them, and how can we use them?
5. Applying OOP lessons to video game programming.
6. Hitboxes, drawing shapes, and making them interact.
7. Drawing, transforming, and creating hitboxes for images.
10. Adding sound and music: how to improve the user experience and engage the user.
11. Menus and UI elements.
8. Our first projects: two weeks of individual development time.
9. Contests, show-offs, and awards for the best games.  There may be prizes on the line!
10.  If there's still interest at this point, we will continue to 3D graphics.


If you can't meet the prerequisites, you can still apply.  Just please make sure you're ready to face problems that will make your brain hurt and consume your time.  These will be long lessons.  If I'm going to dedicate my time to making them, I need at least a two hour per week commitment from you.  That being said, I look forward to using the Internet as an educational medium.  Learn on!

Please note that the lessons will be specifically designed to work regardless of platform.  While netbook-level hardware will still be acceptable for the course, low performance means testing and designing more involved games will be difficult.  I prefer at least a Pentium 4 3Ghz or multicore processor on any platform.

Reply if you're interested in attending.

Edit - As for photo editing and sprite designing, the GIMP, Paint.Net, or Photoshop will suffice, unless we go into 3D (but we will use free, opensource tools in that case).

Edit 2 - (Optional) Please also PM me your personal e-mail, as I would like to e-mail a reminder before the class starts.

Edit 3 - Looks like I'm going to hold it as scheduled.  I will PM everyone who replies here a reminder, as well as post a thread when the class starts with more information.

There is an option to respond to my recordings, so you are welcome to record yourself repeating my audio; if you leave your username with your recording, I'll give you feedback here.""


Hi, so first things first /u/goaway3000 and I will be your teachers, please feel free to PM either us with questions 
or concerns. Now that that is out of the way, allow me to introduce you to your first Chinese lesson.

Before goaway or I begin to teach you words, we decided it would be best to first begin you guys with tones and pronunciation. The current pronunciation that is most widely taught is pinyin, which is utilized in mainland China. The pinyin system is based on roman letters and most of the sounds should be familiar to you.

**I) Tones**

In Mandarin Chinese there are a total of 5 tones. There is the neutral, first, second, third, and forth tone.

*First ā*

The first tone — is marked as a straight line. Think of it as a higher pitched sustained sound.

*Second á*

The second tone ⁄ is marked upwards. It is a rising tone so start from the lower part of your voice, then go up.

*Third ă*

The third tone V is marked down and up. It is a low and curved tone. Think about dropping your voice down and then bringing it back up again.

*Fourth à*

The fourth tone \ is marked downwards. It is a falling town, but it might be easier to think of it as an accent. It's a rather ""harsh"" sound.

*Neutral a*

The neutral tone has no mark. It is a short and light tone.

**II)Pronunciation**

Pronunciation of Chinese words can be broken down into two parts. Initials and Finals. The Initials are generally the first or first two letters in the pinyin word while the finals are what follows.
For example in the following zhang1 (the number at the back denoting what tone it is, neutral tones are simply written without numbers), ""zh"" is the initials while ""ang"" are the finals for the world.

Included below are some guides (taken from wikipedia) regarding their pronunciation.  

[General Pronunciation Guide](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin#Rules_given_in_terms_of_English_pronunciation)

[Guide to Pronouncing Intials](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin#Pronunciation_of_initials)

[Guide to Pronouncing Finals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin#Pronunciation_of_finals)

[Another guide to Pronunciation!](http://chinese.yabla.com/chinese-pinyin-chart.php)


A difficulty you might face when speaking is that getting the sounds to sound exactly right.  One of the challenges, for example, for many foreign speakers is differentiating qu from chu.  The ""ch"" sound is much more aspirated, as if you're blowing something out of your mouth.  The air is rushing between your teeth.  While the ""q"" sound is like you're trying to whistle, you will not be blowing your breath between your teeth, and it'll be blown down towards your lower lip.  So something to experiment with is utilizing your tongue, teeth, and all other parts of your mouth when speaking.  This will help with getting more accurate pronunciations which ultimately will make speaking much easier for you and your listener.  Additionally, as a side note, Chinese pronunciations are not  unique as in ""shi4"" in one context might mean something different from ""shi4"" in another context despite sounding the same.  This is the equivalent of the English ""homonym"".

Once you feel comfortable with pronouncing the basic initials and finals of pinyin you should try to utilize the tones in conjunction.  More will be added on this topic later.  I hope this has been helpful, if you have any questions please direct PMs to me or goaway, we will continue to update this thread throughout the week.  Drills will be posted later.

**Additional Help:**

I can set up personal lessons regarding speaking via my skype, however I have a rather busy schedule during the week so please send me a PM if you'd like some 1 on 1 help with pronunciation.  Feel free to set up a lesson if you just want to practice or check if your pronunciation is accurate.  Goaway will be posting drills later so we can practice those as well.

mdbg.net is a wonderful resource as a Chinese to English or English to Chinese dictionary.  It also includes recorded pronunciation audio files that can be played when you click on the word so later on that will be useful, however if you feel adventurous feel free to take a peak.",,False,self,t5_2rqj9,1370380053.0,,,True,t3_1fmegw,http://www.reddit.com/r/UniversityofReddit/comments/1fmegw/class_introductory_chinese_class_1_6313/,

We ([me](http://www.scirra.com/users/yann) and [Kyatric](http://www.scirra.com/users/kyatric)) are starting a class on [Construct2](https://www.scirra.com/construct2).    
There will be 4 Live sessions every saturday for 4 weeks. These sessions will be recorded so you won't have to be there to get the knowledge.    
These sessions will be live streamed on [twitch.tv](http://www.twitch.tv/), you'll get a link to an IRC channel so you won't have to register on twitch to interact with us.

And on top of these live sessions, we'll be available all weeks to help you and answer your questions. As well as providing extra ressources (capx, short tutorials, maybe some extra video if need be)

One of the good ways to take this class is to follow the course material while trying to make your own game.

The course will follow the process of remaking this game:
www.scirra.com/arcade/addicting-action-games/4255/neon-platformer

We'll provide the assets, examples and sources.

This course is aimed at any kind of user from total beginner to slightly more advanced. The more advanced will probably know most of what will be taught but we'll try to talk a lot about the thinking behind the choice we make. So hopefully they should pick up some good hints.

Also you really don't have to buy the standard version of the software to follow the course (or even to make games), we will exclusively use the free version (:

So please, don't be shy, [enrol for the course](http://ureddit.com/class/76284/making-games-with-construct2) and I hope you'll enjoy it (:

This course would be both for those who've never written songs before and want to learn how, and also experienced songwriters who want to beef up their theory chops &amp; learn some new techniques. I've mapped this out as an 8 week course, each week examining one of the fundamentals of songwriting (chord structure/harmony, lyrics, etc). It would assume a VERY basic music knowledge (e.g. knowing what a chord is, the difference between major &amp; minor), but I also plan to include a ""remedial"" Week-0 lesson on these topics so that everyone could participate.

Weekly assignments would consist of very short analysis of chosen songs (i.e. choosing a song you like and seeing how it uses the topics discussed in class) and short compositions (i.e. using the concepts discussed that week as a songwriter would. These will likely be written, not recorded assignments).

Would people be interested in taking this course?

EDIT: Wow, thanks for the great response, everyone! I'm working on finalizing the lesson plan that I started: It looks like it's going to evolve down to a 6-week course, with a ""Week 0"" of content on music basics. Once I'm 100% sure of the syllabus, I'll create the official UReddit posting and get it started.

My name is Tommy and I'm an Online Marketing Strategist. I host a show [Inside The Mind](Http://tommy.ismy.name/inside-the-mind) and would like to reach some new people.
I really enjoy helping people overcome their online marketing challenges, and I absolutely love what I do.
So here's the offer...
I'd love to put together a series of live classes where I go into detail on some of the challenges you've been having. You wouldn't have to pay anything, really this is just a way we can get to know each other. (if you like the info, it'd be cool if you'd share the show)
So here's the deal, you let me know what your online marketing challenge has been in the comments... if someone else has posted a challenge that is similar to yours... upvote their comment. In the end, the comment(s) with the most upvotes will get a live session dedicated to solving the problem, with Q&amp;A so we can get really specific.
Sound Good? Let's do this :-)

**Edit** 

Alright so it looks like you guys want to do this! 

From what I can see we have a couple of topics we can cover, so I'm thinking we break this up into 4 sessions starting next month (so I have plenty of time to prep each lesson) 

Based on Upvotes it looks like the most popular so far are

*conservativecowboy and self published author advice

*vyl8 looking to expand their art model portfolio, get their etsy store off the ground...etc

*lonely_puppet wants their get more exposure/hires for their photography business

*onesidedsquare has an airsoft field and they want to get more players in the doors

As for content I'm thinking something along the lines of simple but essential chords, strumming patterns, simple songs, picking patterns and warm ups.

Like hours and hours per day, which isn't realistic for most people. I'm more inclined to a more leisurely but long-term commitment, like weekly meetings over 3, 4, 5 months.

I am a slow reader meaning that I study really slow which is really annoying because sometimes I can't even study the whole subject for a test.

I never read the book I'm studying more than once because I don't have time... Please help me speed read.

And he is always reading novels so I guess that might help... He read a 700 page book(not studying just reading) in 2 days... I would take like a year to read it!

1369894594.0,59,self.UniversityofReddit,1fblzb,[Offer] Intro to Nuclear Magnetic Resonance [NMR] Spectroscopy,68,9,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/UniversityofReddit/comments/1fblzb/offer_intro_to_nuclear_magnetic_resonance_nmr/,"Nuclear Magnetic Resonance is a physical phenomenon that can be exploited for a number of practical purposes in medical imaging (MRI's), materials science, and industry in general (for example, oil well logging), and is a topic of ever increasing interest.  The inherently quantum effects involved in the phenomenon are rich in complexity making NMR spec. instrumentation a broad and interesting field in its own right.

The curriculum would assume only a knowledge or college physics I, but would quickly introduce new concepts and be relentlessly cumulative in nature, however self-contained.  Physics II (electromagnetism) would be very helpful.


This course would be most suitable for a natural science undergraduate, graduate student, or technical professional who would like to understand nuclear resonance. However, as the lectures are highly pictorial and both qualitative as well as quantitative, so that anyone who is curious could learn something.

The course is organized as such:

1) Conceptual / qualitative NMR
2) Theory of NMR
3) Instrumentation and technique

It would be wonderful to be able to follow the above *ordering* of topics, but I personally feel, as others have mentioned (e.g. Cowan) that NMR is best understood through explanations which often involve a mix of all three at once.

The topics would be (subject to change):


**The NMR concept**

1.1 Gyroscopic precession

1.2 Classical spin-orbit coupling

1.3 Larmour Precession I

1.4 The magnetic moment concept

1.5 Particle motion and magnetism

1.6 Spin moments and the Bohr Magneton 

1.3.1 Quantum mechanics basics and the Zeeman Effect

1.7 Nuclear spin and magnetic moments

1.8 LC circuits and spin kicking



**Theory of NMR**

2.1 Gyromagnetic ratios

2.2 Bloch Equations and the rotating frame

2.3 Magnetic susceptibility and NMR

2.4 The quadrupole interaction and NQR

2.4.1 Earth's field

2.4.2 NQR transitions for non-axial EFG's

2.4.3 NQR as a perturbation to The Zeeman effect, and vice versa

2.5 The relaxation parameters T1, T2, T2*

2.6 Spin lattice relaxation and spin echos

2.7 Fourier techniques in NMR



**Instrumentation and technique**

3.0 Electronics, components, and a sketch of spectroscopy

3.1 Pulsed NMR basics 

3.1.1 Spin kicking

3.1.2 Tank circuits, impedance matching, coil geometry

3.1.3 Superheterodyning

3.1.4 Duplexer circuits and tricks

3.1.5 Noise 

3.1.6 Noise II



3.2 CW methods

3.2.1 The susceptibility and filling factor

3.2.2 Quenching oscillators





3.3 RF quirks

3.4 Signal amplification

3.5 Signal Processing

3.6 MRI, fourier techniques and 2-D NMR

3.6.1 The problem with high fields

3.6.2 Pulse sequences and Noise

3.7 Filters

3.7.1 The transient response problem

3.7.2 Phase locking tricks

3.7.3 Temperature considerations

3.8 NMR and industry

3.8.1 NQR and industry

3.8.2 NQR as a method of detecting arbitrary substances

3.8.3 Varactors, and diode clamps

3.8.4 Open problems in NQR: combing the desert



The above syllabus came from a series I gave in 7 1-hour sessions and do not imply anything about the pace of the course; e.g. they are not equal in length, in terms of the course material.

NMR is still very much under development and input from others would be appreciated and potentially implemented.

Edit: okay guys, I would run the course with 4. I am thinking of mostly voiced over videos of me writing on paper in color and narrating, vee hart style. 

Weekly problem sets and then discussion times, either by text only (e.g. Skype) or perhaps video conferencing, though I am not terribly excited about overcoming the technical difficulties therein.

I certainly did not expect this many people to be interested in it, I almost expected about three people to join but I'm satisfied with the reception. I'm going to create the class now, so stay tuned. Lesson 0 will come in less than three days. To answer some people:

No, this isn't a scam of any kind. I'm not asking for money in any way. This is not a ""get rich"" scheme. As the title states, it is to make money on the side. If you become good enough at this, and have seen that it works you can probably pay your rent with it (maybe two times over) but don't expect to make millions. If you're having financial trouble, though, I'm sure you'll find my class very intriguing and helpful.

**COURSE WEBSITE**

http://ureddit.com/class/59660/

Please ""add"" the class if you're interested! As of now, I will begin writing the syllabus and lecture 0 whilst we receive classmates. Once I get a handful of you, I will launch  the lectures.

**Will there we be live lectures?**

Yes, some lectures will be live lectures.

**This isn't a scam, right?**

Of course not. I'm not asking you for any money at all. Further information can be found on the class website.

**Will there be homework? Quizzes/tests?**

Yes. Yes and Yes.

**Wait, so we're getting graded?**

Yes.

**What incentive do we have to do well in this class?**

Do any of you really think I'd be grading all of you with no incentive? Of course there's one! The top 15% of students will receive a prize. It won't be some cheap thing you find at a 99 cent store, either! It'll be a nice prize, perhaps it might even be worth something! Top 5% of students will get something bigger, and the top student will receive quite the prize, inching around the hundreds in value.

**EDIT**:  Course is a go.  I have set up a subreddit where I will be slowly accumulating information on the course up to day 1.  Tentatively, we will start on August 27th.  Shortly, I will officially register the class with Reddit U, but for now it's just the subreddit.  
  
http://www.reddit.com/r/introtechwriting/  
  
Please PM me with something along the lines of ""I will be taking this course"" and I will add you as an approved submitter.  I will update again when the course is officially registered and you can sign up for it there as well.  
  
For my own sanity, I'll be capping us off at around 20 or so people, so first come first served.  I won't be able to manage the course with any level of quality if I have to read submissions from more people than that every week.  Of course, the subreddit is publicly viewable so you will be able to ""audit"" if you miss the cut.  And if this course works out well, I might consider doing it again so you may have another chance.  
  
Original post follows:
  
So I stumbled upon this subreddit a month or so ago and since then, I have been thinking about ways I could contribute.  Looking around, I have noticed a number of writing classes being offered, but they are almost exclusively creative writing.  My writing background is a little different and I was wondering if people would be interested in a beginning technical writing class.  
  
A technical writing course would cover writing informatively for a technical audience.  It is NOT the same thing as journalism, although it would be closer to that than it would be to creative writing.  As part of the course, I'd also offer tips on how to be a better writer in general which would include some style suggestions.  This would encompass grammar and spelling assistance in ways that a basic grammar/spell check wouldn't help you.  
  
Some of the things we might cover in such a class would be writing instructions, writing surveys, writing proposals, and understanding other types of business writing.  In designing the course for beginners, I would take a ""wide and shallow"" approach, trying to cover a range of technical writing topics without going too deeply into any one.    
  
Pr-requisites would be high school level education in writing in English (your determination if you meet this standard, I won't turn you away but you might find the course too challenging if you are recently ESL or still in high school).  Otherwise, you won't need anything.  I'll provide lesson plans and references to optional reading, but nothing required.    
  
If I see interest, I would plan to start this course in mid to late August.  I know it's not as ideal as doing it right away when people will have more time in the summer, but I need to put together materials ahead of time because my job can sometimes take a lot of my free time; I don't want to commit to a class and then get half way in only to lose two or three weeks because of other engagements.  I'd rather have the whole thing ready to go before I start so I can meet the commitment.  Off the top of my head, it'd probably be 8 to 10 ""classes.""  
  
My BA is in English and my MA is in Technical Communications.  I was a member of STC for a number of years as well, although I ended up going into a parallel career field and as such had no reason to maintain that membership.  I currently work as a web developer but I regularly work with clients who need to share a lot of technical information, so I still end up doing the odd bit of tech writing and editing.    
  
If there is interest, I'll get started on a lesson plan and announce a start date relatively soon.  

EDIT:  Seems like there is sufficient interest.  I will spend some time getting materials together and announce again when we're ready to start up.  Thanks for the feedback, looking forward to it!  We'll aim for late August.  ",,False,self,t5_2rqj9,1342099827.0,,,True,t3_wdxwj,http://www.reddit.com/r/UniversityofReddit/comments/wdxwj/interest_check_technical_writing/,

Relevant Ureddit pages: http://ureddit.com/class/198  // http://ureddit.com/class/227

Companion websites that go along with the courses:  http://beginnerscpp.com/  // http://beginnersjava.com/

At present there are (for C++):

45 lessons (some of which are 2 part) spanning from installing the ide / compiler to hello world, up to vectors, classes, stringstream, simple file I/o, loops, cases, arrays, etc. (roughly 11 hours of verbal content with video)

7 bughunts (Where I post the code and have the users try to find the bugs)

2 challenges (with solutions in case you get stuck)

And as for java:  

15 lessons -- from setting up the ide, to for / while / do_while loops, arrays, if / nested if, and nested loops. (roughly 4.5 hours of content)

5 bughunts

I am writing more content literally as fast as I can and would love if I could get a few more people that are advanced in coding to come and help me conceptualize challenges, write bughunts, or even change my mind about the course of my lectures. 

There has been a larger focus towards the mathematics aspect of programming in the recent lessons / exercises (the challenges are almost purely math concepts so far) and would enjoy if the community could give me feedback about that as well.

Lastly, if anyone out there has a huge amount of experience with wordpress I would love some help in getting the website sorted out the way that I was hoping.   Thanks a lot and see you all in class!",,False,self,t5_2rqj9,False,,,True,t3_jlcmh,http://www.reddit.com/r/UniversityofReddit/comments/jlcmh/classes_updated_video_guides_to_c_java_new/,
1308408507.0,58,self.UniversityofReddit,i2y4f,[Offer] Independent 3D Animation Production,65,7,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/UniversityofReddit/comments/i2y4f/offer_independent_3d_animation_production/,"I've been wanting to design a course for a while now targeted at beginner to intermediate 3D animators that would go through the entire process of creating an animated short. It would go through the entire production process (concept art, pre-production, modeling, texturing, rigging, animation, rendering, authoring, etc...) and is meant to be more of a ""this is how you make your own film"" rather than ""this is how you use software"". Though, it would definitely show you how to use the tools covered.

The curriculum would be based on a video tutorial series I would produce and offer on YouTube for anyone to view and learn from. Alongside this, I would have a private forum with all of the supplementary written materials, links to resources &amp; other tutorials, downloadable lesson files, etc... for any students who are enrolled. As well, I would act as a sort of ""mentor"" by giving you what feedback / advice / help that I can.

As a student (depending on your skill level) you will either have followed along and made a copy of the animated short that I create as part of the video series, or you will have learned from the lessons and created your own short as you follow along the lessons. The idea is that this course is organic and you would learn what you wanted / needed from it.

I intend to turn the curriculum/forum portion into a paid online course (the videos will always remain free). I would hope to use this as a means of funding my own independent projects, while being able to help others see theirs come to life. However, if I go through with this, I want to offer the first class for free to RedditU as a sort of ""beta"" test and get some feedback.

So if there is interest, please post here and I'll keep your username on a list of people to invite when I get it done. Though I have a few questions for you!

* I use Maya in my freelance work and know it best, however am considering developing this course in Blender so that everyone can (legally) access the software. Any preferences?
* If interested, what is your current skill level?
* If taking it, would you be working or in school full-time?
* Why are you interested in this? As a hobby? To get a job? To produce your own indie animations?
* Any specific requests / ideas / desires for a program like this?

That's all I can think of for the moment. If you're curious about what I can create, google my username and you'll find my portfolio. I'm not a CG god, just a lowly freelance artist trying to get into the indie scene and help others do the same.

**EDIT**

Wow! Thanks for all the interest, it actually excites me to see so many people who would like to take part. For everyone that's posted, I've saved your username to a list of people to invite once it's completed. Just a few things I should mention:

* There were a lot of comments showing interest in Blender, so I will put in the effort to make the curriculum only use applications that are open source and/or freeware (Blender, Audacity, GIMP, InkScape, etc...)
* It will take me several months to produce the videos and course, so you'll have to be patient. Maybe sometime in September / October I could start the first run of the course.
* I'll be posting the videos as they are made, so feel free to subscribe to my [YouTube channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/shamelessplugmedia) or follow my company's [Facebook Page](http://www.facebook.com/ShamelessPlugMedia). Yes, self-promotion, sorry... but it's easier than trying to update through Reddit and have no-one notice.
* If you have any questions / comments / ideas, feel free to message me!


Oh, also I found this great resource for learning Blender if anyone wants to get a head-start on their own!

While many of you are aware that we have live, ongoing courses, some of you may also like to go through content at your own pace. Unlike most MOOCs that choose either or, we have both options available based on your preference. With this in mind we have gone through some of the great courses that are currently available for you to go through at your leisure, and begun updating our calendar of classes. We'll be adding more over the next few days in addition to the current courses that have live lectures.

My personal specialization is medieval institutional history (including history of religion and history of the university). I am considering teaching a course on reddit (or rather, a sequence of courses), and I was wondering what the interest level would be like.

Basically, my thoughts at the moment are to do two courses, one covering the Medieval and Early Modern Periods, and the other to cover The Early Modern and the Modern Period.  There will be a small amount of overlap, but that is because I want both courses to act as stand-alone units.  If interest is high enough, I may make it a three course sequence and include an Antiquity course.

Questions I have that you should comment on especially:

* Text books?  Yes, or no?  For examples of books I would use, see [this](http://www.amazon.com/Beginnings-Western-Science-Philosophical-Institutional/dp/0226482057/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1314573447&amp;sr=8-1) and [this](http://www.amazon.com/Scientific-Enterprise-Antiquity-Middle-Ages/dp/0226749517/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1314573488&amp;sr=1-2).  I will treat reddit like my classroom, no books over $20, on the occasion a $30 one.
* Journal Articles?  I'll check with our university lawyer, but I'm pretty sure I can make them available (with a password) and it would be covered under fair use.  
* What kind of assignments would you want to do? Do you even care about having graded work?
* Are there any specific areas or issues you want to cover?  I.e. the (alleged) conflict between religion and science in the medieval?  The economic history of science?  Specific scientific fields, such as physics, etc.  Regional interest?  Spain, Islamic contributions?

Depending on the interest, I will try to have a tentative syllabus available by October 1st, and the class would not start until January (giving time to get hold of books, etc.).  *I will GLADLY modify my syllabus to cater to personal interests.*

Most importantly: If you think you might take this course, please respond via comment or pm.  Even a simple ""I'm interested"" is sufficient.  Knowing how many students I'll have will help me prepare a proper course format, etc.

**EDIT 1:  Based off what I'm hearing so far I'm thinking the following:**

* **$50 budget for books**
* **No graded assignments**
* **An optional guided research assignment for those who wish to gain practical experience in historical research**

**EDIT 2: **

**It seems that there are a lot of people who want to look at the conflict between religion and science.  While I think that it would only be discussed in passing in a History of Science course, I might look into doing a class on that issue specifically in the future.  If that is something you would be interested in, please be sure to include that in your responses.  :)  **

**EDIT 3:**

**I am working on the syllabus now.  I will have more information for you all shortly.**

Basically, I would be teaching the very fundamental tenets of physics, starting with Newton's laws, forces, energy, momentum, and moving up through gravitation, and waves.

If its popular enough, I may follow with electricity and magnetism in a second course, going through charge, current, voltage, resistance, Ohm's Law, Kirchhoff's principles--up through Maxwell's equations and the nature of light and optics.

I'd like to hear what you guys want, though. Since physics is mathematics applied to the real world, it would be (unless you seriously don't want it) based on mathematics. I can do algebra based stuff, which includes the basics. However, what I would prefer to do would be calculus based, which is what someone in a physics major would experience in their first year at the college level. Note: This is not a calculus course. I'll introduce basic mathematics at the start (dot/ cross product, vector notations, etc), but I will not be reteaching you Calculus. 

For any high school students out there with basic experience with calculus, this would be a good start/ accompanying material for the AP Physics C (calculus based) course, which might be beneficial if you pursue sciences in college.

So, if you guys would have me as a teacher, I'd love to tell you how the universe works!

EDIT: I think there may have been some confusion. For right now, I'm just thinking about doing Mechanics. Electricity and Magnetism will follow if it's popular enough, if I'm interested enough in doing it, and if it fits well within my schedule. This summer I'm finding myself with a lot of free time, so I though it'd be cool to teach the very basics to some people that might want to know.

Fret not: mechanics is a one semester course in itself. This course is not intended as an AP Physics C mechanics substitute, nor is it a substitute for a college level class. The tests I have designed are not set up in a manner to prepare you for either of these. If you are interested in Physics, want a start in it or complementary material to what you're learning now, this is for you. If you want to get out of early physics courses in college using ONLY this, I wish you good luck, because this will not be supportive in that regard.

EDIT 2: Alright, I think I'm doing this then! I'll start around mid-May, announcing the course here. 

Given admin advice, I've decided that I'm going to teach the course in small chunks. We'll start with the mathematics of physics (vectors, dot and cross products, etc), then move on to kinematics and start on forces. If I still have the energy to keep going, and if you guys still have the energy to keep going, then I'll move on to the next section. This will continue until either I/ we stop, or we have reached the end of the mechanics material. I guarantee that I will finish each section, however.

Work in this class will consist of the study of solid earth processes, rocks and minerals, and will include several virtual field trips to reinforce the concepts explored in the class. Additionally, I will post several self tests to allow you to check your understanding of the concepts you have learned.

Classes will begin Friday, January 6th and will continue every Friday for 15 weeks. Classes are not live, but lessons will be posted on Fridays. I'd love for you to ask questions by messaging my reddit account or to become more involved in any way you deem appropriate. 

Please make sure you sign up for the subreddit at http://www.reddit.com/r/introgeology. This is where I will be posting lessons, self-tests, and the virtual field trips.

I'm an Aeronautical Engineering student, and this would cover about half the course material of a freshman-level primer on the topic.

If there's interest in the topic, it will probably run for about 6 weeks starting in late June/early July. 

**EDIT:** You'd need to understand basic physics and calculus (probably the equivalent of Calc I/AP Calc A and Phys I/AP Physics C:Mechanics) for this course.

**EDIT 2:** Wow, I didn't think there'd be a big response to an Engineering course.  I'll go forward with this then - unless there's an unanticipated delay, the class will start Monday, June 27 which will give me some time to prepare materiel.  I'll try to have materials (syllabus and a schedule at the least) posted on June 20th.

The Fall of the Ottoman Empire, The Arab Revolt, and the Rise of Arab Nationalism.

If you had to pick a single event which formed the modern Middle East, it would be the Arab revolt and subsequent collapse of the Ottoman empire. 

By the end of the First World War, what had been a stagnant loosely controlled backwater of the Turkish empire was now ruled by the British and the French tasked with turning them into modern countries. 

More importantly however, the Arab political identity had been born- They were a people and they wanted a state. This infant Arab nationalism would come to influence Mideast politics for the next century.

The Readings will be _Setting the Desert on Fire: TE Lawrence and Britain's Secret War in Arabia_ by James Barr and _A Peace to end all Peace: The Fall of the Ottoman Empire and the Creation of the Modern Middle East_ by Fromkin. There are a few movies I might assign as well if I can find links.

My qualifications:

I'm 8 credits away from my degree in political science which has leaned heavily in the direction of the Middle East.

The class structure:

The classes will consist of a month long reading of two books on a particular subject with grades based on informed reddit based discussions that demonstrate you've done the reading.

Readings: 

As much as I'd like to have an entirely online format, there's a lot of stuff that's just not on the internet yet, so I'll be assigning readings in dead tree format. I'll do my best not to have books cost more than twenty dollars a class (If that's too much and you really want to take the class, PM me and I can help you out) I'd also be sending out relevant articles.



EDIT: I'm going to tentatively set the start date at two weeks from now, May 23rd. I don't know what eawesome3 has in mind for official registration, but I'll be creating a subreddit for the class and posting some maps and articles and things. In the meantime, pick up the books (I found mine on Amazon, but they should probably be in the library too)

For those who do not know, I am already teaching [a class on C programming, here](http://www.computerscienceforeveryone.com). I have been asked to show videos demonstrating what it is like to work as a professional programmer ""real-time"". Solving problems as they happen, the thought process, the way a professional programmer really works, etc.

Last Saturday as an experiment, I held the first such live-stream session and it went very well. Therefore, I have decided to do this on an ongoing basis as part of a new course, on how to build an entire web application framework from scratch.

[You can watch the first session here, and I recommend that you do before the next session begins.](http://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/110g60/live_streaming_building_a_web_application/)

For those who do not know, a web application framework is basically a programmer's toolkit which can be used to build complex websites and web based applications. The purpose of this series is both to give beginners insight into how a professional programmer works, but to be newbie friendly enough even for complete beginners. 

The next session will begin at 9:00 PM EST on Saturday, October 13, 2012.

During this session, I cover the following points:

* Saving screen sessions for later use, and more about using GNU screen.
* The basics about HTML Forms, including GET and POST
* The basics of log files, including apache, php
* The basics of setting up a ""controller"" 

As was the case with the last session, I am doing this somewhat blind in order to accurately depict a real working environment, so I am not entirely sure how many of those points we will get to. 

If you have any questions or comments, feel free to post them, and I hope to see you on Saturday.

I'm a 4th year Irish PhD student in cosmic ray astrophysics (Not the best weather here to be experimental!). I would love to give a basic Astrophysics class here on Reddit if my fellow redditors would find it worthwhile. 

My only prerequisite would be some basic knowledge of calculus. Some things I would cover are:

**The Sun:** Has it always been the way it is? How long will it be there? What will it look like in a billion years? What will be its eventual fate? Is it a typical star?

**Stars:** What do we know about them? How are they formed? What keeps them burning? Do they have a min/max size? And how we do know so much about them since they are so far away?!

**Cosmic rays:** (My own research area) Are there particles out there that are more energetic than the ones in the LHC? What makes them so energetic? And why should we care?

**Light:** So it a wave or particle or what? Why is it created in stars? Reddit tells me nothing can go faster than it, why? What's so special about light?

**Black holes:** Where did they come from? Is all matter eventually going to be sucked into them? How common are they? What makes them black? How can we detect them?


Probably more too, and I might do optional programming exercises if I have time. If there's any particular area of astrophysics you're interested in just let me know!

I would like this to be a theoretical class, i.e. we would discuss and/or derive the equations describing the evolution of a star, the minimum size of a black hole etc. But I'm open to making it more experimental if that is preferred, e.g. discussing the inner working of the Hubble space telescope.",,False,self,t5_2rqj9,1345496296.0,,,True,t3_yjfq1,http://www.reddit.com/r/UniversityofReddit/comments/yjfq1/interest_check_intro_to_theoretical_astrophysics/,

1. Have you taken calculus before? If you are currently taking it, what material are you currently studying?
2. Why would you want to follow a UReddit calculus class?
3. What degree of review would you need before the start of the actual calculus material?
4. I plan on typing notes and drawing figures as necessary to lead the course, and those will be uploaded online and permanently available (probably a combination of being hosted on ureddit.com, available through Dropbox, and a backup will be hosted somewhere else). Would you prefer live video/audio lectures with interruptions for questions being encouraged? Would you rather read the material yourself and later come to a question/answer session? Is there some other format you'd prefer?

I plan on covering:

1. Brief review (probably one lecture's worth) of basic algebra and precalc, centered around concepts which I've seen many people struggle with while grading papers for my university and in places such as in /r/learnmath.
2. Brief discussion on why calculus is needed, a little bit of history, some more general background. This will likely be its own lecture.
2. Limits and the concept of infinity.
3. Derivatives
4. Integrals
5. Some slightly more advanced topics, which will be chosen as the class progresses depending on interest/requests/&amp;c. Higher dimensions? Differential equations? Discussion of other topics in mathematics? Applications (e.g. physics)? It will be decided as a group.

Of course, the structure is open to discussion and revision.

There won't be homeworks, at least not in the sense that there will be assigned problems to be collected and graded. I plan on writing some problems and on borrowing some problems from various books that I have. I'll post solutions after a while and will be available for discussion and/or help with the problems.

I know their have been requests and offers made for a course like this in the past, however it seems that the last Python course was requested/offered 9 months ago and apparently is now inactive.

With that said, I'd like to know if any previous or new instructors are willing to offer this type of course again for new or previous students?

Lastly, can anyone tell me if UOR archives any/all courses and the accompanying materials for future use? If not, I think UOR should start doing that.

**Some suggestions (if enough students join):**

**1.** After about 5 lessons or so, have students pair up with someone to create mini programs/projects to display what they've learned.

**2.** Allow users to use GIT/SVN/Bitbucket to get them familiar with project collaboration. If they're new to version control, this could be a good beginner example.

**3.** For a final project, possibly have another team project (2 or 4 student pairs) to create apps using the [Android SL4A -- Android Scripting Environment](http://code.google.com/p/android-scripting/)

The last project could be voted upon and whoever gets the most votes, gets Reddit Gold or something. 


Basically, give me an incentive to want strive to create something. With the help of another redditor/student, this is very much possible, as both students would be responsible for eachother and their work. 

Just my 0.02 cents.

**P.s. I can help with Git, Linux, and Android basics.**

Most of it will be fun and experimental (small) exercises, to teach how to think about and manipulating space :). The class would consist of a tiny little bit of design theory and a lot of talking about what each of you made for the assignment. There might be a maximum to the amount of participants for this reason.

This course will have no practical value whatsoever, since it'll be too short of a time frame to learn anything useful, the object is to make you look more attentively at the built environment through experiencing how it is to make something yourself.

Architectural theory/history, as well as the more analytic skills that are necessary for looking at typologies, interpreting locations etc. wouldn't be taught in this class. If you would rather have an architectural history class I'd be up for that too, I just don't have time to teach two classes ;).

Just throwing this out there, I'll draw up a lesson plan asap if there's enough interest :). I'm an architectural design student myself, working on my thesis right now so I'm almost done.

edit: reddit is being weird, I can't see any comments, even though the counter says there are 6. Thanks for the interest though! I will answer any questions there might be as soon as I can see the comments.

1371133987.0,48,self.UniversityofReddit,1g9pcf,[Class] Introductory Chinese - Class 2 (6/12/13),61,13,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/UniversityofReddit/comments/1g9pcf/class_introductory_chinese_class_2_61213/,"Hi guys, sorry for not posting this earlier.  Both Goaway3000 and I have been very busy this week.  Anyways, to continue from last week, we will continue to review tones along with some basic words.  Also, if any of you can find a way to record yourself saying the words or sentences in this lesson and post them in the thread that would be a great way for Goaway3000 and I to check to see if you're on the right track or not.  Today we'll review the third tone sandhi and the half third tone.




**Third Tone Sandhi**

The third tone sandhi can be seen when you see two third tones following each other. What happens it the first third tone of the pair becomes a second tone instead.  So for example, if you're reading ni3 hao3, you'd read it as ni2 hao3.

If you had a string of four third tone words the following you would happen: 

Let's say your sentence is: wo3 zhi3 you3 liang3 ben3 shu1

What you end up reading is wo2 zhi2 you3 liang2 ben3 shu1.

The reason why you don't read wo2 zhi3 you2 liang3 ben3 zhu1 is because of the meaning of the sentence.  The sentence reads I only have two books, so the words that would go ""together"" so to speak are zhi3you3 and liang3ben3 as opposed to wo3zhi3 you3liang3.  This is a bit complicated I realize, but as you learn more chinese the groupings of which words with which will become more natural to you.

**The Full 3rd Tone and the Half 3rd Tone**

A full third tone should begin from mid-low to low and then rise to mid-high pitch. But in spontaneous speech, the third tone is rarely pronounced in full. Say the following phrases/words as naturally as you can. The important thing to remember is that a 3rd + 3rd = a 2nd + 3rd in speech but stays the same in writing.

特別好 (tèbié hǎo)
(exceptionally good)	
三百 (sānbǎi)
(three hundred years)	
課本 (kèběn)
(textbook)	

You will probably find that ""hǎo"", ""bǎi"", and ""běn"" did not rise at all when you said them. Instead, they started and stopped low. A third tone pronounced in this fashion is called a half third tone, because only the downward accenting as opposed to the full down then up third tone contour is produced. Nevertheless, the tone mark remains the same in writing.

**Finally: Vocab!**

I think that is enough for now.

My own personal opinion here- that sounds like a great idea if executed properly. I think it would also be a great idea to allow a variety of 'approved' members that can make submissions on topics within their specific field.

* What other changes would you like to see?

In reply to some comments in that first link I posted- the creator of the sub is doing very well. He and his team are swamped with work due to a huge increase in funding and research projects. That is a very *good* problem to have as a researcher. The down side is that now there is little time for making new content and improving the old.

I'm still really excited about teaching this course.  This weekend, I will start formulating the syllabus - when this is done I will post a new thread on r/UniversityofReddit.  Hope to see you guys soon!

Hello!  

I'm really excited that this exists on Reddit - I'm a graduate student pursuing a PhD. in Molecular Biology (with an emphasis in cell signalling and disease mechanisms) and would love to dive into teaching a class open for those in the Reddit community with little to no foundation in Science.

If there is enough interest, the curriculum would include (but would not be limited to): 

-how the scientific method works

-very basic genetics (DNA and how information is read by the cell) 

-cell biology (basic structure and machinery of the cell)

-microbiology (basic principles of how bacteria work)

-human physiology and maybe pathophysiology (how our bodies work on a molecular level)

-general lab techniques and how scientists are using them to answer questions 

As my background and main interest is in research, I will try to emphasize the experiments behind big findings (the experimental approach behind Jenner's cow pox vaccines, etc.), and try to incorporate interesting areas of ongoing research found in scientific journals today.  Also, to make the subject even more applicable, I will include many examples incorporating human physiology into the lectures.  I will also try to get my medical student husband to free up some time to answer medicine/disease-related problems or other questions about the medical profession!

I love science and strongly believe that EVERYONE should have some basic understanding of science and free access to knowledge.  My goals for this course are to introduce busy people who do not work in science or academia to basic biology and scientific methods and hopefully foster an interest in those with little exposure to it!  I will also be happy to answer any questions about research scientists, graduate school, or what working in science can possibly entail.

As such, I will tailor this course in a way that will include a lot of basic scientific concepts and provide an open forum for questions.  There will be reading and of course, recommended articles and resources should you develop more questions about a certain topic.  I will also try to provide flashcards and outlines for important concepts and other resources should you want to better learn the material.  What I will not do is give out homework or force you to learn anything.  Participation is voluntary and completely up to you.

Please let me know if you're interested!  I will formulate a more concrete syllabus once I get more people to commit to signing up for the course.

Many of you already know me as the guy who is teaching the video guided introduction to C++, and for those of you that don't, I'd like to welcome you with a warm hello.

My name is Damien, I'm a 3rd year college student in the CS field, and I've decided to teach as much of what I've learned about programming since I've been in school via video lessons during the summer.   At first it was in hopes that I could make a wildly successful youtube channel and make about how much I would working this summer, now it's more because I realize how much I enjoy teaching people how to code.  I haven't made any money off of this, and I don't really seek to do so.

My background with teaching is as follows:  I'm a professional level tutor at the school I attend, teaching topics ranging from intro to bio to Ochem 2, I am also a lab monitor / computer tutor,  which tends to involve a mixture of programming related questions, as well as questions about Windows / Word / Excel, and simplistic stuff like powerpoint / saving / moving files, etc.   I have been doing this job at a professional level for over 2 years now.

This class will be beginning on 7/1, and will likely run for a total of 10-15 weeks.   I will be (trying) to produce at least 1 video each (week)day for this course, and 1 video each day for my C++ course.

Humans adapt to technology very easily. We drive cars without knowing what’s under the hood. We use computers and smartphones much the same way. Among all the different pieces of technology that we use, an obvious but often overlooked example is that of our own bodies.

This course will link everyday experiences with topics that lie at the core of Biochemistry. By studying how our bodies transform sugars, fats, and the proteins, we will follow the transformations of the food stuffs in our breakfasts, lunches and dinners. We will read lectures from Nobel Laureates, we will peer into the active sites of enzymes, and we see how modern medicine deals with things going wrong.

Prerequisites - Some organic chemistry.

SYLLABUS

At its core Biochemistry deals with two direct yet deceptively simple questions: (1) where did it come from, and (2) where does it end up?

Lecture 1 -- The hemoglobin-oxygen complex: We will interrogate the hemoglobin-oxygen complex using the two core biochemical questions. We will touch upon heme biosynthesis and breakdown, oxygen transport to the tissues, and the expression and degradation of proteins.

Lecture 2 -- The Electron Transport Chain and Oxidative Phosphorylation: We will trace the source of the electrons that are added to oxygen we breathe to generate water. We will also learn how a gradient of protons is converted into ATP.

Lecture 3 – Structures: We will focus on the structures of FADH2 and NADH. We will also play close attention to the structures of folate, guanine, adenine, uracil, thymine, cytosine, thiamine and pyridoxine. We will bank on the knowledge of these structures for the familiarity we need as we journey deeper into Biochemistry.

Lecture 4 – The high-carb meal: We will eat a high carbohydrate meal, (in our imaginations), and then we will herd the carbons of glucose down the glycolysis pathway, and around the TCA cycle. Then, we will travel with its electrons up the Electron Transport Chain, all the way to oxygen, to make water.

Lecture 5 -- Glycogen and Fatty Acids: We will store some carbohydrates as glycogen, and we will funnel some of the carbon from carbohydrates into fatty acids. We will also study glycogen breakdown and fatty acid breakdown.

Lecture 6 – The high-fat, high-cholesterol meal: We will eat a 4-egg cheese omelet, (again in our imaginations) and learn how lipids are digested, how they are packaged and shipped into the blood stream. We will also travel on a few different lipid cargo-ships in our blood stream.

Lecture 7 – The all-meat meal. We will study protein digestion, and the urea cycle. By now, all of us should be experts at herding carbons into the TCA cycle.

Lecture 8 – Purines and Pyrimidines: We will ask the two core biochemical question to the molecules that make up our DNA. Understandably, in cancerous tissues these biosynthetic pathways work overtime, and we will see how some anticancer treatments are based on chemically inhibiting these pathways.",,False,self,t5_2rqj9,False,,,True,t3_1f8m58,http://www.reddit.com/r/UniversityofReddit/comments/1f8m58/class_basic_biochemistry/,

I'm considering putting together something to get people over that first hump and get them started writing original music.

A little background:
I write music like this: [http://tindeck.com/listen/bowi](http://tindeck.com/listen/bowi) and if you want to learn to write music like that, then I can help you out. It's all about ""need to know"" learning. Simply put, you don't need to know a lot of music theory to start writing music. You *will* want to learn it eventually, but I think it's a bad place to start. It delays the creative process too much. New software + new mindset + new vocabulary = huge investment of time before you get to the good stuff, and you don't even know if you *like* writing music!

So what would this thing entail? You'll grab the 30 day free trial of REAPER, I'd whip up a few video tutorials (something I've been wanting to do anyway), you'll follow them, make stuff, send it to me, (probably twice a week? we'll see) and I'll be like ""hey, this part is good, this part isn't, and here's why I think that."" We'll do that for a few weeks, by the end you'll know enough about music theory and about REAPER that you can start experimenting on your own and (ideally) you'll know whether music composition is something you want to pursue seriously or if it's not the hobby/career path for you.

I'd expect anyone going into this to have zero experience with theory and production, but if you know something about either (or both) I can accommodate you with some additional info/assignments.

I'm a student in my fourth year, so time is pretty tight. I can probably only teach 5-10 people, and the way it would work is you can install Inventor for free (via their student website, if you aren't a college/high school student let me know and I can get you an older version) and do 1 or 2 tutorials a week from them, and then I'd assign some sort of part or assembly that lets you use the knowledge gleaned from the tutorials. Inventor's tutorial library is gigantic (I haven't done all of them), and the general modeling tutorials are really good. If you'd like to learn the analysis tools (Stress/Strain, Temperature, Aerodynamics) I can make or find tutorials for those.

I've not taught a class via UReddit before, but it seems to be pretty simple, so I think we could start next week. If there is anyone out there who wants to help me, that would be appreciated.

* No, the class is not assembled yet. However, I wanted to point out that I'll probably put the course materials on [Connexions](http://cnx.org/aboutus/), an open educational resource that I think is worth exploring.
* A nascent thesis for the course: the ethical themes that both drove and drew Wallace were advancing toward a Buddhist outlook. It's unlikely that DFW had some sort of agenda; rather, Wallace's earnest moral exploration *arrives* at Buddhist truth in a mutually validating way. Any more detail I'll reserve for the class, partly because it's still totally unrefined, and also because I have a little hope that this is actually original thought on my part (!!). So, I'm interested in either developing this idea, or following it, so I'd really appreciate it if someone would let me know if they take this idea and run with it.

(I hope this whole Buddhist thing doesn't come across as New-Agey; overarching ideas enhance reading and interpretation, but I also think I'm on to something! Zadie Smith agrees that much of Wallace's fiction can be fable-like. In fact, **I** think the ethical heart of the works of Wallace could be what enabled him to continue *formally* experimenting [c.f. his self-doubt about literary ""stunt-pilotry""]. A sort of yin/yang thing maybe? Actually, Jonathan Blow's lecture ""Video Games and the Human Condition"" is very relevant here. ...God, I'm going to love teaching this course.)
**&lt;/update&gt;**

My university offers its students the ability to put together classes other students can take. (Granted, they're only one credit instead of being three or four, and you get Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory instead of a letter grade, but they do have very high standards for what gets approved as a class.) Basically, if I finished crafting the course for them on [David Foster Wallace](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Foster_Wallace), would there be enough of an interest here that I should put the class on University of Reddit? I expect the course to focus on his essays, short stories, and excerpts of novels. I also expect to group the sections of the class thematically, rather than chronologically, because Wallace had this fascinating tendency to explore similar ideas in very different contexts.

Anyway, just offering. I don't know how far away it will be, but if there's an interest I'll post it here regardless. And maybe if you post on this I'll personally message you when it happens.

**EDIT:** Perhaps you'd like some inkling of what the curriculum could look like? If anyone has any suggestions, I'd love to hear them. I'll be in the development phase for a while yet. Like, should I downplay the formal stuff and make it more bookclubby? (I don't mean that pejoratively) Or should I throw some more intellectual stuff in there? Does it seem I'm focusing too much on Wallace rather than the subject of Wallace's writing, or vice versa?

* Broad introduction to him and what the class entails.
* WTF is postmodernism?? Or modernism, or post-post-modernism (extra WTF) for that matter? [A clarification of terms is necessary.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postmodern#Contested_definitions) Aaaaaand is reading Wallace as a postmodernist even the most valuable method? There's an essay on Dostoevsky that's totally relevant, but I might want to save it for later...
* In what ways did Wallace attempt to advance literature formally in his early work? What changed in the transition from *The Broom of the System* and *Girl with Curious Hair* to *Infinite Jest*, *Brief Interviews with Hideous Men* and *Oblivion*? Can we discuss this change solely in terms of his work, or (keeping in mind Wimsatt &amp; Beardsley's Intentional Fallacy) is it necessary (or at least sufficiently beneficial) to consider changes in Wallace's life when examining his works?
* A class would be on Tennis, of course. Probably sections of *Infinite Jest*, his essay Tracy Austin, and either Federer or Joyce.
* We'd touch on parts of ""Authority and American Usage"" in order to flesh out the concept of dialect, and then we'd examine how important and varied the roles of Wallace's narrative voices are.
* In demonstrating more dialects (I'll almost definitely include at least parts of ""The Depressed Person"" here) we'll also get into some of the depictions of addicts and addiction in *Infinite Jest*.
* We'd have to stop by Wittgenstein at some point, because DFW had a strong background in philosophy &amp; Wittgenstein was personally meaningful to Wallace (especially regarding the implications of philosophy of language on philosophy of mind). In fact, I think *The Broom of the System* was conceived as an argument between Wittgenstein and Derrida.
* Hell, what do y'all think of his ubiquitous footnotes?
* Some time would be spent on the role of entertainment, with excerpts from Infinite Jest and ""A Supposedly Fun Thing I'll Never Do Again"". Is the parallel Wallace makes with addiction valid? If the parallel is valid, that seems to imply the difference between an addict and non- is a matter of degree rather than essence. I might throw in some concepts that Jonathan Blow (creator of Braid) explored that seemed eerily close to DFW's thoughts.
* ^^ That would naturally segue into pretty deep purpose-of-life stuff, with readings like his essay on ""The Nature of Fun"", his Kenyon College commencement address, quotes from DFW's interviews, the ""Is love a choice or an uncontrollable condition?"" arguments between Marathe and Steeply in *Infinite Jest*, some of Zadie Smith's beautiful distillations of Wallace from her essay ""The Difficult Gifts of David Foster Wallace"", various things in his repertoire regarding imagining other people complexly, and whatever other else I decide at the time. I'd like this section of the class to fuckin' change lives. I might even split this final one into two: one in which we'd talk about each of the additional readings separately, and then one where we tackle the deep personal stuff drawing on ALL of the class's readings

I mean, there are other questions I'd love to address in a fully fleshed-out, 3-credit course too (examples: as **incredible** as *Infinite Jest* is, did it ultimately fail? Does that affect its value? Or perhaps, is Orin a Hideous Man? How do *Infinite Jest*'s linguistic or image-based motifs add resonance to its themes? What do all of the single-quoted dialogue, inconsistent voicing, and flexible narration imply?) but I can't really go after those without requiring all of *Infinite Jest*.


**EDIT 2:** Thanks for showing your enthusiasm! It actually encouraged me to impulsively make some progress on this =). However, I feel bad that I might be whetting people's appetites when I really might not teach this for a long time. I'm definitely teaching it before I graduate, but it could be a year or more before I finally get this together. As a result, if you just can't wait to start DFW, here's a jumping off point:

* At what point (between chapters 1 and 2) do you believe the narrator and those dining with the time traveler actually begin to believe his story?

* Unlike other stories of time travel, how does this differ?

In the past I have taught on ureddit about online communities and some introductory courses about social media as well. While I know not everyone on reddit is fond of social media, there are quite a few uses for the network. 

For this class offering it will span over two sessions. One, a very simple introduction to creating an account, what each thing does, and some more advanced communication tips (understanding acronyms, using third-party tools like Tweetdeck).

The second session will be more about communication theory, more specifically a type of computer mediated communication theory (CMC). Though you may have 140 character limit, you don't want to use all of them, and there are ways to include yourself into public conversations. If you like meeting people throughout the world, discussing your favorite hobby, or even networking, this could be beneficial to you.

If there is interest I will teach these two sessions in the first week of September, and they will be recorded as well. As a reference, you can find some of my past classes here: http://playthismedia.com/class

-Your friendly neighborhood ureddit mod teacher guy.

**Update**: So it would seem there are enough people who would like the class to happen. I will shoot for producing them in video/presentation form and release them in the first week of September. If you have any specific questions about using Twitter, send them my way and I will be sure to cover it during one of the two sessions.

Now, I'll be the first to admit: I'm a shit artist. I mean *real* shit. But this isn't an art class, this is a class where I'll introduce you to the basics of working with Illustrator, and vectors in general. What you make is up to you.

What I've planned so far:

* What are vectors, and why are the so much awesomer than bitmaps?
* A quick rundown of the interface of Illustrator
* Working with the (many) tools in AI
* Anything you want, really.

I'll probably end up doing a livestream or Google Hangouts or something, depending on what people prefer. Again, the syllabus isn't final, so feel free to suggest anything that you want to learn, and I'll try my best to incorporate it.

I think that reddit should offer classes taught by people with college degrees in an online format. I feel myself more and more inclined to study something new and original, but don't have the money to enroll in the classes that are outside of my major. I think many people can agree with me that the best way to have someone learn is through intrinsic motivation and I believe this would open doors for people who are self-motivated in learning, but find it nesscary to be in a proper learning environment. If anyone knows of any sort of software that could be used for free that would allow for professors to each online with a power point or other medium please let me know. In the mean time I hope the community can come together to produce a learning environment. Don't get me wrong I love cat pictures, but I find reddit to be a powerful tool that could be utilized if we were able to work together.

The Professor: The professor should have some sort of credentials that can be verified by moderators before they are able to begin teaching a course. The professor would be fully responsible for creating a curriculum.

The Class: The class would be fully online and could use a number of books that can be found online in one way or another. The classes could range from anything such as Knot Tying to Quantum Mechanics. Professors can have homework assignments and can be collected and then posted online without names for other redditors to discuss and grade.

The Students: Participation would be completely voluntary, but registration would run similar to the way it is run at school. If you haven't signed up before the first couple of classes then you are unable to enroll in the class.

Grades: Grades could be kept in a reddit that shows all courses that a student has passed and failed and his grade in each of those classes. A moderator could be in control of collecting the grades at the end of each semester from the teachers and posting them online in the appropriate grades reddit.

Let me know in the comments any other ideas and I will edit this post accordingly.

I want to know how many people on here would be interested in a course on how to use Redstone, ranging from basics (such as doors) to more complicated things.

**Prerequisites**

Obviously you must own a copy of [Minecraft](http://minecraft.net). You also must have either a Creative save available (preferably a Flatland one) or your Survival save with a lot of Redstone available. Just make a Creative Flatland save, though. It'll be a lot easier that way. 

**Schedule**

Most likely a weekly lesson, lasting approximately an hour each. Lectures will be hour long lectures approximately once a week via Google Hangouts (live version) which means not only will you be able to view the lecture live as it happens but also the lecture will be recorded and put up on YouTube, for viewing later on.

**About Me**

Huge fan of Minecraft looking to explore unique ways of using Redstone, while teaching others the basics and hopefully inspiring some locked-away creations that players wanted to make but couldn't because they didn't know how.


EDIT: Why did someone downvote my comments? Eh Whatever.

Anyway, It seems there's a lot of interest so I am gonna spend tomorrow working on a lesson plan of sorts, and setting up the class officially! I shall message everyone who's commented on here when it's done, and also will make a new post about offering the course! :)

Go on over and check it out- r/IntroToGraphTheory!

Howdy, r/UniversityofReddit!  My fiance and I are thinking of offering a course through UofR on Graph Theory and Applications.  Here's what we were thinking:

* **Prerequisites:** those of you with an interest in mathematics might find this course interesting and stimulating!  Graph theory as taught at our university is an upper level undergraduate mathematics course, but we are going to try to make it accessible to a broad audience.  Therefore, for those of you who do/study mathematics, I think a good idea of what discrete mathematics is usually gives you a good start. Many people who have experience with combinatorics or number theory are interested in graph theory, for example.

* **Material:** When it comes to course material, we want to cover ideas like graph parameters (including diameter, degree, etc.), planarity, real-world models that make use of graph theory, history, etc. etc.  We would NOT cover any topology, however.

* **Schedule:** We are going to try to build this graph theory course around a graduate level one we will be taking, so it will coincide with our school year.  If there's interest, we would start in about 2-3 weeks. Weekly materials will be posted, and it will (at least at first glance) last 9ish weeks.

* **About Us:** We are honors mathematics majors (seniors) at a small state university where the mathematics faculty puts emphasis on discrete mathematics.  We have both done a great deal of graph theory research and will hopefully have about five papers by graduation (if it all gets accepted, haha).  We have given talks at various mathematics conferences including the Joint Meetings, MathFest, and smaller, regional conferences. We will be enrolling in graduate school for discrete mathematics (PhD program) next year.  We're just two math folks who love mathematics who really want to help spread the word and educate people about what we do!

As I sit here [waiting](http://bloggingallthethings.com/groups/beer/forum/topic/my-first-home-brew-creating-beer-at-home) for my first batch of homebrew beer wort to finish boiling/cooking thanks to ureddit teacher [JBHowat' beer making class](http://www.reddit.com/r/UniversityofReddit/comments/uq14k/update_beer_homebrew_class_lesson_2_is_now_online/), we are going to attempt to fulfill a request of yours. We are making an effort to make it a bit easier to know when a class starts or when it will take place.

**1** The first step we have is a simple Google calendar that can be found here: http://play-this.org/university-of-reddit-class-schedules/ (this is being embedded and hosted on my site, for some reason you can't just have a public Google calendar). This will be populated over the next week or so, and listed on the sidebar.

**2** The second step is to have teachers that are currently teaching to please hit the ""Schedule a meeting"" button at the top of this page: www.tungle.me/ureddit, and submit your upcoming class times. The subject is your class name, and the location is where students can find the materials or live class.

**3** The third step will involve me reaching out to each teacher that has an active class, and asking them to submit a class schedule. Because this will take a long, long time, if you schedule a meeting yourself it will make this process much easier for everyone.

**4** And finally, I will work with Anastas to ensure new teachers know to add their course to this calendar.

The ureddit team would like to apologize for the confusion that may have come prior to having a standard format for listing class times, and we truly appreciate you all letting us know we had a gap to fill. In the future, please feel free to continue to either post a message here or send the mods a message to let us know if you have any other issues, suggestions, or questions. 

Thank you all again for being part of this awesome endeavor to further your fellow redditor's education, and a special thank you to all the teachers willing to teach. Not to mention Anastas, who truly puts a great deal of time and effort into development here (he could always use a hand).

If you have any questions, do not hesitate to ask or post them in the comments of this post.

We now have a [page](http://ureddit.com/class/206) on ureddit, a [class] thread in /r/UniversityofReddit and a [survey](http://www.reddit.com/r/frenchclass/comments/i09gl/students_please_complete_this_availability_survey/) that you need to fill out before you get started. 

We also have a shiny new subreddit [/r/frenchclass](http://www.reddit.com/r/frenchclass). I can't wait to see you there!
**

 Hello chaps, 

I see there's been some interest in French for beginners and I'd be more than happy to teach it. It would be French-French rather than Canadian/other-French, but the basics will be understood pretty much anywhere. 

I'd be prepared to teach both reading/comprehension and speaking/listening, so you'll get a pretty good all-round feel for the language. For the written and reading parts of the course, I'll prepare a downloadable plaintext document on a weekly basis, and for the spoken element of the course I'd like to use something like skype, and get small groups together to practise for a hour or two a week (or as schedules permit). 

If you're interested, let me know! You should also let me know your time zone and your availability for small group speaking practise, and then we can get started as soon as possible. 

:D 

**EDIT:**  
Ok, so since there are a whole bunch of time zones, and a various levels of experience, I propose we work it out like this: The speaking exercise will be available in 2 or three slots across the week: **a weekday early slot (around 8am EST), a weekday late slot (around 10pm EST)** and a floating weekend spot to try to fit in all those who couldn't manage one of the others.

The students in the future will have to let me know if those times are doable, but they're basically reversed. The 8am EST slot will be **11pm in Australia (9 in China**, I think), and the 10pmEST slot would be **1pm Aus (11 China**).

I'm working on the curriculum as we speak, so now is absolutely the best time to tell me what you want to get out of this class. **I'm basing the curriculum on things you would need in order to go on a tourist holiday in France**, so ordering in restaurants, reserving a room, navigating a city, emergency visits to a hospital and that sort of thing. If you'd like something a bit different, let me know now, and I'll absolutely work it in.

**I'm thinking that this course should last for around 15 weeks**, possibly in 3 five-week segments with a little gap between them. I will test you at the end of each segment, but the tests have absolutely no bearing on anything, other than letting me know how well I've taught you, and perhaps encouraging you to study a tiny bit harder.

For those slightly more advanced students, I may well recommend that you join at the second module, rather than the first, just to avoid the absolute basics. The second module will probably be something of a refresher, but the third will be dealing with some of the trickier bits of grammar, and will be a whole lot more speaking and listening orientated.",,False,self,t5_2rqj9,True,,,True,t3_hy264,http://www.reddit.com/r/UniversityofReddit/comments/hy264/offer_french_for_beginners/,

It has more details like a syllabus and stuff. I will post any future information there and use the class list to PM everyone when things get going. Thanks!

EDIT: Ok, there's enough interest here for me to start working on this. I've jotted down some notes for a syllabus and once I can flesh that out in detail I will create a Google Groups page and start posting stuff. It will take some time, though, to create all the lectures and the example/exercise database. I want to make sure I have enough of the groundwork done BEFORE we start so you guys don't get left hanging! So, the original estimate of 4-5 weeks stands at this point.

--

I see there was an SQL course a couple months back but it was unclear whether the class happened or was finished or what. Also the materials weren't made available for use after the class was over, which I would do.

So is anyone interested in another one? My 'qualifications' are having taken SQL/database classes in college, having developed several database driven applications, admining a MS SQL Server/CRM application it supported, and writing database structure and query documentation for enterprise sized applications professionally. I'm NOT an 'expert SQL developer' but I certainly feel I am experienced to teach a beginners course. (Aside: I'm wary of anyone claiming to be an expert at anything.)

Format would be about six, ~30 minute ""PowerPoint"" style presentations with voice over lectures spread over as many weeks, plus datasets/exercises (figure on 30-90 minutes depending on the week and how fast you pick the material up) and informational handouts, and a group mailing list for follow up questions and help (both from me and fellow students). All software would be free, almost certainly open source, and platform agnostic.

If there's general interest, I'll create a class on the UofR site and post a syllabus with topics to be covered. Caveat: this class wouldn't start until mid-August at the earliest. Probably later, so call it 4-5 weeks from now.",,False,self,t5_2rqj9,True,,,True,t3_crmez,http://www.reddit.com/r/UniversityofReddit/comments/crmez/offer_intro_to_sql/,

I would like to teach a class that would walk students through the creation of a engine, starting with the basic physics of point masses and eventually ending with a real-time collision simulation of arbitrary 2D rigid bodies.  I would most likely leave more complex interactions, such as joints or other constraints, for a later course.  The engine obviously wouldn't be something you could use as-is in a production-level application.  I'm more interested in teaching the theory and then applying that theory in code.

The pre-requisites would be a high-school level knowledge of calculus and fluency in a programming language, most likely Python (although if a majority of students want to learn in another language, I'd be totally flexible).  I don't want this course to be a lesson in programming, which is why some programming experience is needed.  I will provide plenty of source code, but students should be familiar with the idea of classes, methods, etc.  All of the physics and math, on the other hand, will be taught from the ground up (starting with vectors and the laws of motion).

I wanted to gauge the interest in this type of class before I commit to writing the text needed for the course.  In addition I'd probably need to rework my existing code a bit. Is anyone interested?

**EDIT**: Since there seems to be a lot of interest in this idea, I'm going to work on getting a class page/syllabus up and running by tonight.  Thanks for your replies!

The Civics test is extremely nerve-racking in its content and format, especially for those who were not educated in the American education system at a young age. I have set in place tutoring within my university (and hopefully local library) for students who are Green Card holders/Permanent Residents that plan on taking the test within the next year. This post is to gauge the interest for such a course on /r/UniversityofReddit and possibly universityofreddit.com.

I am in the process of creating the necessary materials and adding them to my own website (also still in the process of finishing). I know that there are *several* resources available through the series of government websites, **but** I have found that it needs to be communicated in a way that supplements or replaces independent study (as I said earlier, especially for those who are not educated in American history). I have also found that my knowledge of Latin American history is especially useful in creating parallels when studying Colonial and early American history for those who are attempting to become naturalized from the region. Of course, this is open to would-be citizens of all regions, and you will be provided the same level and quality of instruction should you not be from Latin America. (I just got happen to have a focus on the region's history and given my area of residence mostly encounter this demographic). 


Any takers? Or know of anyone that would be interested?

**In order to best utilize the course, you should be:**

* 18-64 years old
* Able to effectively communicate in English
* Be eligible to take Naturalization test
* Be a Permanent Resident/Green Card holder 
* Expecting to take the test within the next 12 to 18 months


**edit -** If you are interested, send me a PM or post a response below. I hope to have a few, but will continue to set up the course regardless for anyone that needs it. It is formatted through Independent Practice using materials that I give while tutoring. I am considering recording and posting short lectures or at least voice recordings to help you through. 


**edit #2-** It should be up and running by mid-August. I'll PM those that were interested and post another text-post with all of the links.

It would be run as a ten week course with lecture notes and practice problems posted each week and solutions to problems posted at the end of the week. 

Unfortunately, live lectures and video lectures wouldn't be much of an option right now. I'd be available via Skype and email at varying times throughout the week. Google Groups would also be used for discussions among the students.

Topics by week:

1. Infinite Series and Power Series
* Applications of Infinite Series and Power Series
* Linear Equations; Vectors, Matrices, Intro to Linear Algebra
* Continuation of week 3
* Partial Differentiation
* Multiple Integrals and Applications of Integration
* Vector Analysis
* Continuation of week 7
* Complex Numbers
* Functions of a Complex Variable

The textbook I would reference is *Mathematical Methods in the Physical Sciences* by Boas, 2e. It's cheap if you pick up a used copy on Amazon.

I love math and I love teaching math. This is as much an experiment for me as it is an opportunity for you to (hopefully) learn something. I'll more than likely explore different methods of contacting you and delivering lectures and assignments in order to figure out what works best for everyone. For my own information, I'd probably include a short survey at the start, after week 5 and then again at the end just to get your take on everything.

If all goes well, I'll aim for a section class after the first finishes - either Methods of Applied Math 2 (more stuff from Boas' text), a class on math projects or a general survey of upper level math - stuff on abstract algebra, real &amp; complex analysis, linear algebra, and so on.

As for credentials, I'll be graduating this April with a B.S. in Applied Math from the University of Pittsburgh. I'm currently waiting to hear from a few different places on graduate school in Applied Math.

Any interest?

**Prereq** You should be familiar with basic Calculus. You should be able to differentiate and do basic integration at the very least.

-------------------------------------

Hey fellow UofR students -

In January I'm looking to build a brief introductory course series on building online communities and community management (this would be ideal for folks who are looking to take on this sort of work). Community management is becoming a larger need for companies as they have realized that not only is social media playing a role in their marketing, but they must be able to create platforms for customer service, communication, and learning.

I have just published a masters thesis on the subject, and will be pulling information in from communication theory up to examples from my own professional experiences (there are a lot to work with).

**[Register for the first class](http://cmgr101.eventbrite.com/) - **

**Please note that by registering this will help me with two things. One, letting me know the interest level, and potentially trying to get LiveStream to work with me on a non-profit or donation of upgraded service (no annoying ads in the middle of the class, and better video quality). Second, I will be able to email everyone registered the recap of the class so if you can't attend you can still hear the presentation.**

In short, I plan on taking a trip to Sweden in the future and, if everything goes perfectly well, move there and get a master's.",,False,self,t5_2rqj9,False,,,True,t3_clpp7,http://www.reddit.com/r/UniversityofReddit/comments/clpp7/request_swedish/,

**SPRING SEMESTER**
*JAN-APR*

A class built with beginning bicycle advocates in mind. It covers cycling and it's relationship with the sustainability (green,ecological,environmental,hippyhappyfuntime) movements.

We will touch on the science behind a cycling culture. We talk about transportation economics, ecology, and the differences in culture and how cycling plays its role around the world.

During the semester you will learn everything you want to know about bikes. We will talk about bike; technologies, construction methods and materials, accessories, tools, and brands. My goal is to make you feel super comfortable next time you visit your next local bike shop. Be prepared to have a more intimate understanding of your machine. 

Students are encouraged to participate in the final project taking the first steps to help make their community more bicycle friendly. Take action at home, your community or workplace!
examples; Data gathering, a compilation of bike statistics, hosting a bike workshop, advocating safety and security, proposing a bike rescue or bike share for their community etc.

I am enrolled at a top engineering university and have spent over 6 years of my extra curricular time to the study of the subject. I have received recognition for my efforts and am using this class as a simple way to compile and pass on the information.


Im still finalizing the syllabus but a rough draft can be found on the class page. If you are a student and have material you'd like to cover please message me.
If you have information to contribute or would like to teach with me please message me.


Tldr; Share the road

I developed about half of a text book for learning and teaching one of the 4 Japanese alphabets, and offering this class will prompt me to finish it.

Written Japanese has 4 alphabets.  Hiragana, Katakana, Romaji, and Kanji.

Hiragana and katakana are 46 character syllabic alphabets, and the starting point for anyone learning Japanese.

Kanji is a harder subject, with 2136 official kanji and thousands more that are rarely used.

Romaji is what you are reading now.  The plain old 26 character 'Roman' alphabet.

This class should take 10 weeks or so done at a leisurely pace of 10 characters a week, but could easily be done quicker.  5 Characters a day with a review every 6th and 7th day would be 4 weeks or so.

Using Adobe Photoshop I'll take you through sketch to completion with some post processing thrown in there at the end just for fun. 


**What you can expect to learn**

* How to create a sketch that will help guide your subsequent work

* How to use the Photoshop pen tool to create paths and shapes and masks

* Some techniques and different approaches to completing your illustration that will influence the 'style' of your piece

* Handy layer styles and clipping mask techniques that will speed up your process and save you time.

* Masking textures to shapes to create unique patterns and colors

* Some other various handy post processing suggestions and tips


**What I won't be covering, and is worth looking into**

* Doing vectors with Illustrator

* Using the free-hand pen tool to simulate raster-style brushes within Illustrator

* Spot colors and nifty print shenanigans


...



At the end of this course you should be able to create a full vector (and raster hybrid, if you like) piece of your own design. I know I've dropped a lot of Adobe names, but I feel a lot of the information I'll be covering is more technique centric than program- so if you'd prefer to follow along in illustrator or something else feel free! However you might have a little difficulty emulating the layer clipping, masking, texturing or post processing sections. I'll do my best to accommodate whatever you choose to use by suggesting alternatives.



...




**Before I start setting up my course material and times, I have some questions for you**

* Would you prefer I do these demos live? They can take quite a long time, but Ustream would work well enough and allow me to take questions. An alternative to this would be posting step-by-steps with screen-shots and such.

* If it were live, at what time would it be most preferable to hold them? I'm at my most free on the weekends.


* Are there any special requests or specific areas you would like me to focus on, or any things you've seen around that you might like some insight into how they were done?



Thank you for your interest, and I'm looking forward to getting to share with you guys :)

Hello there URedditors! This week we have quite a few updates for you, and some other stuff coming your way very soon.

1. Book Club
2. New annual awards
3. New help video available

* First things first, I wanted to thank those of you who have participated in our first week discussion of our monthly book club, and invite everyone else to join in this Friday. On Friday our second discussion will launch where we will discuss chapters 1-6 of The Time Machine. More details can be found on our UReddit page.

* Second: Annual awards. When our mod announced that we were asking the community how they would like to distribute the best of awards for 2012, we unfortunately did not get a lot of response. Internally we were looking at ways to give them out anyway; however, with a post that was created yesterday this may be the perfect opportunity to hammer down our annual awards.

With the unfortunate passing of Aaron Swartz, and the request of the community, we will be creating an annual award in his honor with four runner ups this year. This year we will distribute awards to teachers you feel had a great impact on your desire to learn.

Based on interactions, community votes, and class enrollment, we would like to suggest the following teachers be recognized for these awards, and from the list you all can choose which one should receive our special recognition. We’re working with the reddit admins to be able to create stickers and other swag, so once we get those we can send them to the selected teacher as well.

Let me preface this by saying I have no idea if these people are male or female, so my apologies in advance if I mark you as the wrong gender. Also, there are so many awesome courses that were created in the past year that it made things rather difficult to highlight just a few of our teachers. If you feel that there should be another teacher on here as well, please list them in the comments.

**Those nominated for the first annual Swartz Award for Open Education:**

/u/sarevok9 He previously taught an amazing course [Introduction to C++: A video guided tutorial](http://ureddit.com/class/23620/introduction-to-c----a-video-guided-tutorial) that has nearly pulled in 6,300 students. More recently he has been working on his other course, [Introduction to Java: A video guided tutorial](http://ureddit.com/class/23649/) that has pulled in nearly 4,300 students.

/u/Aznable has been teaching an [Introduction the 3D game art](http://ureddit.com/class/29566/introduction-the-3d-game-art-) course with 1,555 students. The students also appear to be quite active and have been producing some great results from the class. Here is an [example of the bad assery](http://i.imgur.com/B5L61.jpg).

/u/tanknspank for their ongoing efforts in their [Cooking for one](http://ureddit.com/class/23631/cooking-for-the-single-life) class. There are currently 4,165 students enrolled, with a new semester starting to begin.

/u/hearforthepuns beginner [Electronics](http://ureddit.com/class/23587/electronics) has close to 4,000 students enrolled, and their /r/breadboard subreddit was an active place for discussion.

/u/carlh for his [complete course on programming for beginners](http://ureddit.com/class/37773/a-complete-course-on-programming-for-beginners) that has over 2,700 students enrolled. Carl continues to update his series that he started in 2009, and has over 13,000 subs on his subreddit /r/carlhprogramming

Also, while /u/chrunchy may not be a teacher, he has been one of the most supportive mods we have since joining us in the past year.

**Please upvote the particular person you believe should win our first annual Swartz Award for Open Education in the comments below. Downvotes will not be counted thanks to RES.**

* Lastly we have noticed an increase in questions about how a student enrolls in a course, consumes the content, and interacts with other students. Since you have probably stopped reading, I can now direct your attention over to a new video tutorial that helps to highlight the step-by-step process for enrolling in a course, and what you need to pay attention to so you can get the latest class updates. You can find the [video here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MctEDfkNUs). Also, if one of you has a British accent and lives in DC I will happily bribe you with some beer if you want to do voice overs so I can replace my terrible one.

The reason I call this *unspeakable* horror writing is because traumatizing pictures and videos must be reviewed and written about, which could leave students quite disturbed.

Even though this is a writing class, most discussions would involve philosophical questions; therefore, there wouldn't be pressure to have a right answer. An opinion can't be wrong!

Right now I'm planning to have only six classes over a three week period that will cover the following:

**1)** Morality

**2)** Trauma

**3)** Innocence

**4)** The Unknown

**5)** Death

**6)** Suffering 

The class dates haven't been picked yet, but I'm leaning towards weekends. Whatever is good with the students! 

Assignments would be posted to a subreddit, but if students desired blog support, I'd create a blogspot. Since I believe discussing our writing is more important than perfecting it, the assignments wouldn't be required to be very long and grammar wouldn't be graded. The only way to fail this course would be not participating! 

I'm not sure what else to post for this interest check, so please leave questions if you have them, and I'll add more information!

EDIT: Thank you for your interest! I created a partial syllabus before making this post, and will be finalizing it over the next several days. Right now, I'm thinking Friday could be one of the two classes during the week, but if you could suggest a second (or even a better first) I'd greatly appreciate it! 

EDIT 2: **Teacher Qualifications**

I've been writing for several years now, specializing in poetry and short stories. Though I've aced every English class I've taken through my high school and college years, I usually stray away from what I've learned to create my own styles. Multiple professors have praised me for my ability to think outside the box, which I think is where I shine the brightest.

My ability to teach horror writing comes from a brutal method of using past trauma's and oppositions to moral reasoning. If I'm not able to frighten myself with a story, what's the point of trying to scare someone else with it? I believe good horror writers must explore what scares them before exploring how their fears can be used to scare someone else. In my course, you'll learn the basic steps towards doing that. 

EDIT 3 (May 30th): If anyone has been curiously checking on this post, I have great news! I'm approaching the completion of the class lectures, and will construct a subreddit in the next day or two. Thanks again for the support, and I keep an eye out for the official class announcement!

1336328878.0,42,self.UniversityofReddit,t9yre,[Offer] Algebraic Geometry Reading Group,44,2,46,http://www.reddit.com/r/UniversityofReddit/comments/t9yre/offer_algebraic_geometry_reading_group/,"This is an update on: [[Offer] Math Reading Group](http://www.reddit.com/r/UniversityofReddit/comments/schwu/offer_math_reading_group/).

In the previous discussion, there was great interest in algebraic geometry, so I'm going to organize a reading group on algebraic geometry.  Here is the rough plan:

1. Go through Beltrametti et al [Lectures on Curves, Surfaces and Projective Varieties
A Classical View of Algebraic Geometry](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/3037190647/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=wwwonebadseec-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=3037190647) for the classical picture,
2. Go through Hartshorne [Algebraic Geometry](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0387902449/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=wwwonebadseec-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0387902449) for the modern theory of schemes and sheaf cohomology, and finally,
3. Read Beauville [Complex Algebraic Surfaces](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0521498422/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=wwwonebadseec-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0521498422) for the Enriques classification of complex surfaces.

Why this plan?  The Beltrametti et al book is praised for stressing the geometric motivation of the algebraic machinery of AG.  As someone who has studied some of the algebraic machinery without developing much intuition, this approach seems essential.  Hartshorne is the canonical text, but Goertz and Wedhorn seems like a possible alternative.  At this point, Eisenbud and Harris Geometry of Schemes would seem to be essential reading, although not as a primary text.  Finally, my own research is in low-dimensional topology, hence my interest in complex surfaces, although it doesn't necessarily connect directly to my own research.

I should say something about the format of the reading group.  Although I've studied some of this material already, I'm in no way qualified to teach it, and I'll be learning along with everyone else.  The only way to learn this material is to do a shit ton of problems.  Thus, we'll aim to do ALL the exercises.  The main goal of the reading group is to help everyone stay motivated, set the pace, and provide a forum to discuss the material and problems in case people get stuck.  My plan is to post notes I make when digesting the reading and solutions to problems.  Everyone is encouraged to contribute similarly.

I'll aim to start May 21 and go on as long as we can/need.  I'll have some time in the next two weeks to discuss the material if anyone wants to start before then.  Also, it might be useful to review basic commutative algebra (rings, ideals, polynomial rings, etc.) before we get started, esp. if that material is new or rusty.

Finally, none of this is set in stone and if you have suggestions about the material or ideas about how to run the reading group, please post for everyone to discuss!

edit: I'm very excited by all the interest!  I hope we can get some good momentum going.  I created a subreddit for the reading group:  [r/AGreadinggroup](http://www.reddit.com/r/AGreadinggroup).

Though this class is structured with the novice in mind, there will be plenty of opportunities to do advanced work if you are an experienced practitioner.  The course will cover seven topics:

-**1 Vision for Education:** the cultivation of human potential  
-**2 Truths of Teaching:** you can't teach someone who isn't motivated, and you can't teach something you don't know  
-**3 Players in Instruction:** the student, the instructor, and the material  
-**4 Aspects of Teaching:** planning, instruction, evaluating, and reporting  
-**5 cycles of Instruction:** tasks, sessions, unit, marking period, and course  
-**6 Approaches to Teaching and Learning:** constructivist, multi-modal, socratic,  modeling and scaffolding, inquiry-based, and social/affective learning  
-**7 Principles of Professionalism:** persona, relationships, integrity, community, reflection, mentorship and professional development

Each topic will have several short readings attached to it, upon which we will have discussions online, and then there will be an assignment.  The assignments will be posted for peer/teacher qualitative feedback; after each critique session, the learner and teacher will have a  one-on-one conference of reflective discourse.

The assignments will be rigorous; true growth only happens when we stretch, but don't worry about quantity--stretching beyond our current growth is not about heaping on work, it is about encountering novel, complex, difficult-to-define situations and working our way through them.  The goal of such rigorous assignments is to make you think in new ways, in diverse contexts, so as to produce deep, authentic learning (i.e. learning that reshapes our being.) 

Course dates are TBD as people continue to express interest, but tentatively, it will be scheduled for September through November, with two weeks given to each topic.  If the class becomes large enough, it will be subdivided into sections based on students area of interest: k-6, 7-12, post-secondary, and adult/corporate training.

1335682910.0,40,self.UniversityofReddit,sxwxs,[OFFER] Attention Math Majors : Mathematical Analysis and/or Abstract Algebra!,50,10,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/UniversityofReddit/comments/sxwxs/offer_attention_math_majors_mathematical_analysis/,"Hello All:

I am planning to teach a class here on UReddit on at least one of the above topics, I could also throw in a slightly advanced Probability theory course if I find enough interest among ya'll.

To tell a bit more about myself, I am a current mathematics graduate student in an American University. I am a third year graduate student working on topics in Probability theory, more specifically on Random Spatial Processes. So I have had to take quite a bit of graduate level math classes in my career here.

** Please let me know where you're interests are, why you would want to learn real analysis or algebra over the summer when you could be taking a break from math, .. ** 

EDIT: Thank you, user [givemebackmynose](http://www.reddit.com/user/givemebackmynose) : 

***Abstract Algebra*** (**Class Structure**):

I'd be willing to start right where [SchurThing](http://www.reddit.com/user/SchurThing) ends his [Group Theory class](http://www.reddit.com/r/GroupTheory2012/). It would be great if one could go over the whole class, but I've definitely heard of Rings and Fields being treated before Groups. I'd be glad to make a short video reviewing topics in Group Theory for people who want to jump into the class quick.

I'm looking at working through the following chapters from ""Algebra - Michael Artin"":

     3. Fields and Vector Spaces. 
     4. Linear Transformations. 
     10. Rings. 
     12. Modules. 
     13. Fields. 
     14. Galois Theory
    
I am likely to spend about a little more week on each of these topics, but as is the norm, we can have in-depth discussions about any of these in particular as the class progresses. I know this might be considered a bit fast, but I'd like to contain the class within the summer sessions for schools.

Prerequisites:
Usually an introduction to Linear Algebra or basically a proof based class would be sufficient. SchurThing's Group Theory class would be a perfect introduction to Abstract Algebra. I would highly recommend having a look at it.


***Analysis*** **(Class Structure)**

I am going to be using Royden's classical treatise on Analysis for this. These are the topics I'm thinking about:

    3. Lebesgue Measure
    4. The Lebesgue Integral
    6. The Classical Banach Spaces
    7. Metric Spaces
    8. Topological Spaces
    10. Banach Spaces
    11. Measure and Integration
    12. Measure and Outer Measure
    15. Mappings of Measure Spaces

This definitely needs a good amount of trimming to keep it within the given time frame. I'll be open to ideas from others. This class would also require a good amount of Advanced Calculus. 

Feel free to ask any questions. This is going to be a lot of fun. I'd like to take this opportunity to extend a warm welcome to an amazing summer of learning some mind-blowing mathematics.

Anyway, to prepare for the new semester I'm offering to teach just physics, because there are already calc and intro to cs offerings, but I am willing to cover calc and cs.

I will teach calc based, but students that don't have or don't want the calc based approach will not be hunted and killed for sport unless we get REALLY bored.  But really I will teach this so that people that don't have a calc background will benefit from a non calc physics course.  There will just be times that you'll have to stop updating your facebook page on your laptop when I'm teaching the calc based stuff, and update it from your smart phone.

This course will cover:

* One dimensional motion with constant and variable acceleration

* Two dimensional problems with projectile motion and falling bodies

* Newton's Laws

* Rotational motion and Torque

* Work, and Energy

* Conservation of energy and momentum

* Universal Gravitation

* Hooke's Law

I will try to cover two topics a week.  I will request that you at least read the wiki page about the topic beforehand, and I generally won't cover an entire topic again, but I will answer specific questions.

I will try to start it this week if there is demand and people sign up, but I don't know how the site works yet.

Perks:
 
* Keeping fish as pets is really fun.

* Fishtanks are relaxing, good for health and beautiful to look at.

* Fish are (generally) inexpensive, and healthy ones can live a long time.

* You can develop a tank to YOUR liking.

* If you have kids, this is a project they can be involved in - and it's    good for them - introductory pet responsibility, improved eye coordination, and less time in front of the computer or TV.

 
Not-so-perks:

* Start-up can be expensive, especially if you want to keep several fish.

* Sick/dying fish can be very upsetting. 

* There would be a degree of chemistry involved in this course, which can be a turn-off for people who think that keeping fish is simple.

The idea is to learn Classical Chinese through reading the Analects (論語), and learning the relevant grammar and vocabulary as we go along. This will be experimental, since most courses that teach Classical Chinese limit themselves to carefully chosen illustrative extracts that abstract away some of the challenges of actually reading a Classical text. As we go along I'd also want to put the text into a historical and philosophical context, so we would essentially have a combined language and  philosophy course. I am not sure if we'd be able to get through the entire text, but we'll either start at the beginning and see how far we get, or make a selection.   

In order to get the class started I would need some help. I am not an expert on Classical Chinese myself, but I have a good reading understanding of it, and with the aid of Pulleyblank and some friends who have a thorough background we should be able to cover the essentials of the language very accurately. If someone else has a background in Classical Chinese and wants to help teaching the class that would be appreciated. I *will* need help with teaching the philosophy component, since I have big gaping holes in my understanding of Confucianism and the historical context it fits into.  

If you'd want to take the course, I'd expect you to   

* Have some background in modern Chinese language and grammar. Sometimes explanations and translations might be provided in modern Chinese, and I will not teach any reconstructed phonologies  
* Know enough grammar that explanations from Pulleyblank won't seem entirely foreign to you.  
* Participate. If there's only a few of us, you can't piggyback on the rest of the group.

I can't guarantee that I will be knowledgeable about everything, but I will definitely try my best. I also want note that this class will be starting at the very beginning and will be quite basic, so if you have finished the Genki I book or something similar, I wouldn't suggest taking the class unless you just want a basic refresher for the summer or something.

However, I am moderately familiar/proficient with the language, and I think I will be well equipped to teach the basics, so there shouldn't be any problems. However, I just wanted to make sure that there aren't any misunderstandings/confusion with people thinking that I am a native speaker or have my PhD or anything.

Also, due to the large response I got on my initial post, there might be slight issues with some things I would like to include in the class. I'm hoping to implement a variety of different resources, including video lectures and some written notes, but also some real-time interactions. Unfortunately, a lot of collaborative whiteboards, video chats, etc. are rather limited in the number of people that can take part at once (like &lt;10 or so), so the class is definitely going to have to be split up into small groups for these types of things. Also, even with help, I think I might need to limit the number of people in the class, depending on the number of people that actually want to enroll. This isn't to say that I am going to cut people out, I just might need to offer the class multiple times and use some crafty organization to fit as many people in as possible.

To help with this, I've made a poll on Doodle where anyone planning on taking the class can select times that they think they'll be available for collaborative/streaming sessions (USA, Eastern Time / GMT-4:00). Also, I had to make the times for specific dates, but they just represent general times throughout the course. So if it says Monday, May 13 at 1:00, it actually is just for Mondays in general.

This is a subject I'm very passionate about. I have followed the league for many years and have been studying this subject in my spare time for two years now.

topics discussed would include the major players, eras, rule changes, the extremely interesting legal debates (single-entity structure), and facing apathy from within its own country. Class would be taught via video, where notes would appear on screen, intermixed with video from MLS matches, supporters sections etc.


As I have said, I am obsessed with this topic and would love to teach more about it. If anyone would like to help, PM me.

The depth would somewhat depend on how well I know the topic, but it would be ~~around the level of an undergraduate~~ [a] survey course.

**Qualifications:** Rising 3L at the bottom of my class, at a top 30 law school in the United States.

**Effort:** I'm willing to dedicate the next two months, and since my classes resume in August, intend to be done before the end of that month. I may move fast. 

**Potential topics** 

* **Fourth Amendment** - Search and Seizure.
* *Income Tax* - Heavily statutory.
* *Constitutional Law* - A theoretical overview, with extra focus on the 2nd and 4th Amendments.
* *Bankruptcy* - A mix of statute and theory, without focus on forms and filing.

**Update**: Thanks for the votes and critiques. There's clearly some interest, yet a very real (and reasonable) concern that it be of adequate quality. I sympathize with the idea that professionals would ensure a high level of quality, but given that none have bothered to teach a law-related course and students have taught other courses, I feel it might be worth a shot.

I've begun working on a course-plan and the first lesson-plans for a Fourth Amendment course. However, I won't commit to teaching it until I'm sure that the course would be accurate &amp; worthwhile. So don't put your life-plans on hold, lol.

If anyone knows of free materials on the topic, then I would greatly appreciate links (pm or comment). Most people won’t have access to WL/Lexis, and I expect that citing cases won’t be of much benefit to people who aren’t proficient at reading them. 

And for any law-students:  If you want insight into what makes a good exam response, try writing the exam.

I think unless you are living under a rock, you are aware of the Global energy crisis.

Not exactly a class on how to troll, because anyone can troll, but rather a class on how to troll well, and with a purpose other than disruption.  Not your standard, run-of-the-mill hate-spewing trolls.  Trolls that foster conversation instead of derailing it.  Good Trolls.  I am not looking to breed negativity here.
  

I would have to limit the class size and, possibly, implement some kind of prerequisite in regards to your status on Reddit.  Basically, you probably won't be able to sign up if you're a new account and/or an account with little to no karma.  While I would appreciate the irony of a troll enrolling in the course just to troll the class, it would be counterproductive.  

  
I'm still working out the details of what I'd like the class to be.  Ideally, I see it involving the creation of a ""troll"" persona by each student and an attempt to blend in, undetected.  With a possible ""final exam"" being individual troll threads observed by the whole class in real time.  Should you be detected, you fail.
  


  

  
Enrolled students' primary and secondary (troll identity) usernames will be confidential and known only to me, the instructor, and the other classmates; whereas primary/secondary correlation will be known only by me.  You'll know who your pupils are, but you won't know which troll they play.

Weekly, students will be tested with problem questions and short-response questions. 

**Prerequisites** A satisfactory grasp of the English language and very basic short essay skills. It would also be more useful if you lived in a country like the US, UK, Canada, Australia or any nation whose legal system is common, not civil.

As some of you know, Arabic 101 was already being offered as a class, but the teacher had to step down. However, I thought it was a really cool opportunity for you guys to learn such an interesting language. So, I decided to step up and teach the class, with [thegirlwhocriedwolf](http://www.reddit.com/user/thegirlwhocriedwolf) helping me out.  
  
  
Schedule: Monday, Wednesday, Friday  
Starts: Wednesday, September 1st.  
Length: TBA  
Prerequisites: Enthusiasm!  
  

About Arabic: Anyone can learn this language. It's becoming increasingly useful to know this language since Arab nations are beginning to play a stronger role in today's world. Also, Arabic is the official language of the largest religion in the world, Islam.

To be more accurate, this is NOT my course page for Quantum Chemistry.  The course page has not been created yet.  This serves merely as an infomercial for something that I really want to do, and I'd like to find out if I have enough interest to actually do it.

A little about myself:

I am a first-year graduate student in physical chemistry.  I have taken and done well in Quantum Chemistry, Linear Algebra, Multivariate Calculus, Differential Equations, Modern Physics, Physical Organic Chem, and Physical Inorganic Chem - all of which are relevant to quantum.  It was only two years ago that I found myself heading into what most chem majors consider the deep end.  I ended up really loving physical chemistry.  I have some teaching experience, and I feel like everyone who's interested could benefit from this (myself included).

If you:

* Are majoring in chemistry and are about to take p-chem.

* Know someone who is about to take p-chem and would like some help.

* Would like to brush up on your previous knowledge of p-chem.

* Are just plain curious.

Post in this thread and I will pm you.  If I get enough interest I will create a subreddit for the course.  It will not be operated like a regular subreddit - I will be on at specific times that work for as many people as possible.  A lecture topic will be posted by me at the announced time, as well as a brief outline of the topic.  Then, an open discussion will ensue for as long as it takes people to get a firm grasp of the theory.  In this sense, raising your hand will be as simple as posting in the discussion.  Common questions and misunderstandings will make it to the top if enough people participate and it will be very easy to hone in on the important issues.

Topics may include (but not necessarily in this order):

* An overview of relevant calculus with examples (triple integrals, spherical polar coordinates, finding lambda_max of a blackbody, partial derivatives.

* An introduction to operators.

* The Time-Independent Schroedinger Equation.

* The One-Dimensional Particle-in-a-box.

* The Two-Dimensional Particle-in-a-box.

* The Three-Dimensional Particle-in-a-box.

* The Finite Well.

* The Uncertainty Principle.

* The Harmonic Oscillator.

* The Rigid Rotor.

* The Hydrogen Atom.

* Legendre Functions, and Laguerre Polynomials.

* The Physical Interpretation of the Wavefunction.

* Spin and Pauli Exclusion Principle.

* Variation Treatments for Simple Atoms.

* Vibrations and Rotations.

* Any Suggestions.

I'll seed a few questions up here, we start the conversations in the comments, and anyone else that would like to ask a question or bring up relevant points are welcome to do so. There are quite a few of you who have already read or are familiar with this book, so I would highly encourage you to share your experienced insight as well. At this point you all should have completed half of the book, and there will be spoilers here. Don't worry if you are not up to speed, you can always join the final discussion.

**Starter Questions**

* We find that Ofglen is in a world quite different from our own where religion seems to be the controlling party in place of our current political situation in the US. Why specifically do you feel that people (more specifically woman), have been color coated and grouped into so few titles? Such as handmaid or Martha.

* The following quote appeared in chapter 6, ""This may not seem ordinary to you now, but after a time it will. It will become ordinary."" Do you feel this is true to any situation? Can you provide any other examples throughout history that this would apply?

* Any other questions or issues to raise from the book? Add them to the comments!",,False,self,t5_2rqj9,False,,,True,t3_18w1z1,http://www.reddit.com/r/UniversityofReddit/comments/18w1z1/book_club_discussion_1_the_handmaids_tale/,

**Original Post with edits**

Hey guys,
I would like to see if anyone would like a class on starting an internet company and getting seed funding. I am currently a mentor for SCORE.org and have helped around 100 clients plus I have an additional list of 300 clients I have helped in this space with marketing, idea research, etc through my business.

If enough interest arises I will make the first class a discussion on successful vs failed start-ups.

Let me know.

**Announcement** I noticed that most of the ureddit courses are done in a ""sub-reddit"" way and I am considering installing MOODLE as a supplement so grades could be taken, discussions could be made, etc. If this is okay with everyone, I will send out the invites when ready.

Right now, there is no visual difference, but more obvious changes will be happening soon. Some of the advantages of the rewrite:

* **Security**: I've moved to the PDO database driver and use prepared statements, so security is much improved. This is the safest way of interacting with the database and eliminates any remaining concerns about SQL exploits.
* **Speed**: Fewer, more efficient database queries, extensive Memcached integration, and optimized caching of CSS/JS/images make the entire website load and work faster. All added functionality will be able to automatically take advantage of this.
* **Extensibility**: The new database structure and codebase are very flexible. Functionality can be easily added without altering the database schema or duplicating code that already exists; this was a big issue with version 2 of the backend and was the main reason that I rarely added new features.
* **Open-source**: the code for the site is available [as a GitHub repository](https://github.com/ureddit/ureddit). Contributors are welcome.

Next on the agenda:

1. **Website redesign**. The current design is alright, I suppose, but it could do with a lot of improvement, both aesthetically and functionally. To pick two easy examples that will be addressed soonest, the catalog is getting cluttered and the class editing page is simply ugly.
2. **Added functionality**, e.g. more community-oriented features so that the website doesn't feel dead regardless of how much user-to-user messaging/email there is, and more tools for teachers such as statistics on class visitation and easier ways to interact with students.",,False,self,t5_2rqj9,False,,,True,t3_p9yyn,http://www.reddit.com/r/UniversityofReddit/comments/p9yyn/announcement_the_ureddit_backend_rewrite_now/,moderator

UPDATE 1:
==========

This seems to be getting rather popular, so I'll add some more detailed ideas, based on my vision of the class (which is not necessarily the best version of the class).

* The class should be aimed for beginning programmers. The concepts of variables, decision making, looping, functions and maybe arrays, and so on should be safely assumed.
&gt;* These are the ""easy"" concepts. I think most people have no problem picking them up. But then...
&gt;&gt;* Pointers! Floating point inaccuracies! Structures! Unions! Enumerated data types! And those are just the tip of the iceberg. The C language, being relatively low level, can get pretty scary, but I think these subjects should be mentioned when they're useful.
&gt;&gt;* Object oriented programming. It's really not a hard a concept, I suppose, once you've got functions and structures down. But let's assume no familiarity.
&gt;&gt;* Objective-C. Assume no familiarity.
&gt;* Cocoa. 
&gt;&gt;* A high definition overview. Once of my biggest problems learning Cocoa from a book is that I can't really do anything except what the book's examples feed to me. If I want to do something significantly different, an overview that at least gives me an idea of where to look would be nice. Let's fly over the labyrinth before we start crawling through it.

Those are just some ideas, and like I mentioned, they might not be the best ones.",,False,self,t5_2rqj9,True,,,True,t3_ctdpp,http://www.reddit.com/r/UniversityofReddit/comments/ctdpp/request_objectiveccocoa_programming_for_the_mac/,

**I'm interested, what do I do?**

Well, it's simple: send an email to uorgametheory[AT]gmail.com, preferably with your name on (but it's not a requirement), and you will be given your first set of notes by Sunday, 2pm Sydney time (I believe that is 12 am Sunday EST)

My background is primarily in [17th century Italian rapier](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicoletto_Giganti), so that's what I would base the class on.

There are a number of challenges inherent to giving lessons on a physical art over the internet. My basic proposal follows, but I'd love to hear what you think will work for you.

.

I would post a video, as well as text, for each lesson.

Each of you will need a local partner.

Each of you will need a sword simulator of some kind. I'm thinking foils, because [they aren't too expensive](http://www.absolutefencinggear.com/shopping/product_info.php/products_id/174/cPath/24?osCsid=66f82a15cba61959892103a49ff47d53), but will do the job.

Preferably, you would be able to post videos for feedback, but I don't see this as completely necessary.

.

Thoughts?

**EDIT:** There is enough interest for me to move forward. I just have to make sure I have the video stuff figured out before I commit. To help with the waiting, [here's a taste of what you'll be getting](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtScmWzvm1E), coming from an instructor much better than myself. Don't worry about understanding exactly what he's teaching, just try to get a feel for the flavor of the art.

If you're interested in participating, but haven't yet commented in this thread, please do, so that I can contact you when the class begins (assuming, again, that the technical stuff works out).

**2nd Edit:** I'm still hoping to do this, but there's a lot of work involved to get it going. A work conference this week and thanksgiving next week means that I'm reaaaaly short on time right now. A week or so after Thanksgiving, I'll get back to work on this.

I hope to have this done within the next week or so. After that, I plan on posting a set of notes and a problem set each Monday starting on the 17th of September.    



I consider these books to be the best references on the subject; please take a quick look before we get started:    

*Mathematical methods of classical mechanics. V.I. Arnold.  
*Geometry and Spacetime. Sean Carroll. (http://preposterousuniverse.com/grnotes/)




Geometric mechanics takes the viewpoint that classical mechanics is a fundamentally geometric theory and best treated with the mathematical machinery of differential geometry and modern algebra. We will consider geometric mechanics to be a prelude to Einstein's general of relativity, which uses similar mathematics in describing 'the large scale structure of spacetime.'    

While the choice of topics is flexible, I hope to cover:    

I. Geometric mechanics
1. Variational principles
2. Manifolds and structures on manifolds
3. Hamiltonian dynamics on manifolds
4. Symmetries and Lie groups
5. Integrable Hamiltonian systems

II. General Relativity
1. Special relativity and the Poincare group
2. Vectors, tensors, and differential forms
3. Riemannian geometry
4. Curvature
5. Schwarzschild solution

Prerequisites: Working knowledge of linear algebra, multivariable calculus, differential equations, and Newtonian mechanics.

I had a number of students come to me a few weeks ago asking if they could continue to launch rockets after our in-class water rocket project was completed. Naturally, I said yes, and offered to help them with their designs and launch. This entire concept has since blossomed into, ""Can we do an after-school club dedicated to learning about flight?""


So, my proposal to UofR is this; would anyone be interested in an informal, project-based class on flight and the history of flight for non-specialists?


The caveat here is this; if you have a physics/engineering background, you will likely not learn anything new here, or will might even come to me and say, ""You're over-simplifying things here"". That might very well be true, but the point is not to get super technical, the goal of this course would be to talk about flight to people who have little/no background in the topic and would like to build their own flying devices along with just reading and discussing them.


The course would be of an indeterminate length, (since I've only just started writing material) would likely be all project-based, (building a lot of little aircraft) assessment would be community focused, (asking fellow ""UofR classmates"" to comment and assess your work based off of a rubric) and you would be required to submit short writings and videos of your completed project to garner credit for the course (credit here being fictitious, of course, but I would want to give assignments).

I have added an achievement points system, lesson tracking, and new quizzes to my programming course. The way it works is: you earn 20 points for finishing a quiz, and I will add additional ways to earn points later. 

Lesson tracking allows you to keep track of what lesson you were last on, so that if you return to the course later you do not lose your place. 

Also, there are now end-of-unit quizzes for 11 units, and I uploaded more video lessons (over 50 videos now).

I also re-wrote two lessons in Unit 11, and created an entirely new one -- Lesson 11.4.

- **Ethics:**
How should we behave towards each other? An overview of the main positions in contemporary ethics; consequentialism, virtue theory, and deontological theories.

- **Decision making:**
How do people make decisions? Rationally? Emotionally? Unconsciously? The evidence from the psychology of judgment and decision making shall be examined.

- **Creativity:**
What makes us creative? Are there traits which creative individuals share? Are there ways in which we can improve our creativity? Does it even make sense to say that someone is *creative*?

* Free particle solution to Schrödinger's equation
* Finite square well
* Central Potential
* Hydrogen Atom

This is just a basic overview of what will be in this class, and is open to adjustment, though understanding these topics is required before any more interesting topics can be discussed.

edit: 
pre-reqs: 

* basic physics (kinetic energy, potential energy, momentum should all be familiar to you)
* Differential equations:  you should know how to solve a basic second order differential equation.
* Linear algebra: you should have a basic understanding of eigenvectors/eigenvalue problems, have at least heard of the term ""vector space"", and understand matrices and matrix multiplication.
* calculus is assumed in the above, so I won't regurgitate here, but if you don't understand basic differential and integral calculus, you are going to be lost pretty quickly.

1346282558.0,30,self.UniversityofReddit,z1p3u,"[Announcement] New policies regarding [interest check]s, [update]s, [request]s, and new classes, effective immediately",34,4,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/UniversityofReddit/comments/z1p3u/announcement_new_policies_regarding_interest/,"Ever since the subreddit doubled in size on Monday as a result of Reddit's blog post about UReddit, the number of [interest check] and [request] threads began to significantly drown out the rest of the posts. In other words, the signal to noise ratio (considering the aforementioned posts to be ""noise"" and class announcements/updates as ""signal"") has significantly deteriorated.

For that reason, several new policies are being implemented:

1. **No more [interest check] posts.** The website has nearly 60,000 users; it is very unlikely that nobody will be interested in what you have to offer, as long as you take your commitment seriously. Therefore, if you are considering posting a class, please prepare your first lecture / PDF  / video / &amp;c, add it to the catalog, and announce it as a [class] post in the main subreddit. Please also take note of the policy change number 2 below. 
2. **No empty classes.** If you want to conduct a class, please prepare *at least* one lecture before adding it to the catalog. Any new classes not abiding by this principle will be removed from the catalog. This policy change also has the added benefit of forcing new teachers to experience how much effort goes into a single lecture and should decrease the number of abandoned classes. **The only exception is live classes**; if you plan on live streaming lectures, you obviously can't upload a lecture in the beginning. In that case, just make sure to have a clear syllabus.
3. **[Update] posts are strongly encouraged.** Several teachers have been submitting [update] posts to notify UReddit's general userbase of new content added to their class. There seem to be no downsides to this; it is not spam, /r/UniversityofReddit has a larger userbase and is more likely to appear on Redditor frontpages, and recently subscribed users that perhaps had not heard about the class in question hear about it. Since there seem to be benefits without detriments, we have decided to encourage this type of post.
4. **All class requests are to be submitted to /r/URedditRequests.** There are so many [request] posts that [class] and [update] posts are being drowned out. /r/URedditRequests has been created as a single place to post class requests and it will be heavily promoted throughout UReddit's various information outlets, including the public catalog. Once a request in this new subreddit reaches a certain threshold, it will be allowed to be crossposted to /r/UniversityofReddit for increased attention if it has not been fulfilled.

These policy changes will be *strictly* enforced. I expect that some users will disagree with them, but we feel that they will significantly benefit the quality of the main subreddit and the class creation process.

**Edit**: I neglected to address potential worries about splitting this subreddit into two. First of all, only requests are being split into a new subreddit; second, this new subreddit is going to be heavily promoted to all UReddit users via Twitter, the blog, the main website, and ~~so on.

All of the resources will be found both on the UReddit course page and through the Google Group that was set up.


As for now, 9 weeks have been predetermined in the syllabus, leaving the final 10th week to be determined in the coming weeks. All lecture notes will be hosted as a Gist on GitHub, and they will be posted in the Google Group and in the video description on YouTube.

Currently there are over 875 enrolled in this course! The first lecture will be posted on Monday, August 27th, so in a short five days!

I love it for it's simplicity, yet ability to handle things, and do complicated algorithms.

Now, I've been doing Python only for about a year now, but I'm obsessed with it, And spend at least 20 hours a week on it. And I found that I would like to share this logic with people.

So one day, I asked my friend if he wanted to take lessons from me, and he did. So with time I found I liked teaching him. I like sharing my knowledge with people.

So know I want to share it with you people :)

What we'd be learning:

* Manipulating lists

* Manipulating files

* Generating numbers

Basically, handeling things like that. We'll be doing mostly what people will be requesting.

Now, I'm not to fixed on a lesson period, it depends how much people want it, and when I have time.

My specialty is commutative algebra, but I should be able to do any undergraduate level class (and some graduate level) given enough prep time, so don't hold back on your requests. It can be a traditional class topic, a ""topics course"" that highlights some things in a particular area, a course on cross-disciplinary connections, whatever. Vote up your favorites and I'll try to figure out the most popular thing that I can reasonably do.

This is a long term plan here: my aim is to run the course this coming summer, perhaps starting as early as May if I'm not wiped out from dissertation work. The latest that it would go is August since I'll be starting a job then if I'm lucky. 

I haven't decided on how the course would go at this point. I'm fond of a Moore method style of teaching where I provide guidance in what to prove and how, and you guys do the proving and presenting, but I don't know how well that would go online since it requires some level of synchronization. If you have any ideas on the best way UofReddit classes should be organized feel free to toss those out as well.

I am moving to Montreal in September to attend McGill University, and while French isn't completely necessary to live there, I feel like it would be enriching culturally and could probably help me a lot.

I tried learning French using Rosetta Stone, but it was too frustrating because it couldn't tell me what I did wrong. Unfortunately I'm not currently in a position to buy any other software (though if people have recommendations I could probably afford a well priced book).

I've always learned best with a real person (what I mean is that I can use a book, but I always have a number of questions in my head that books can't answer, and I benefit immensely by having someone to ask questions).

I've taken 4 years of Latin during High School so I have a pretty strong foundation in romance languages I'd think. I took Spanish before that but I don't remember it very well.

I would love it if someone could offer a French course. If it went well I would gladly try to offer a UoR course to give back to the community (although I don't know what I could do, maybe something graphic design or biology related).

**Dungeons and Dragons, 3.5 Edition**

*Learn to play, (basics and RP [role playing] tips), Dungeon Master (basics and advanced), or both!*

I'm pretty sure all of you have heard of DnD or had the desire to play it at some point. This course will give you the chance to learn in an environment where you can ask questions and get tips for playing. More experienced players are welcome as well because DMing(dungeon mastering) tips and tips for players will be taught as well after the basics are covered. Come pick up a lifelong, social and fun hobby!

I've been playing and DMing DnD 3.5 (and a few other systems) for about two years now. I currently manage the [r/rpgrecordings](http://www.reddit.com/r/rpgrecordings) subreddit (an offshoot of [r/rpg](http://www.reddit.com/r/rpg) which is a fantastic subreddit) that focuses on people who have recorded sessions of their RPG games.

I'm making this class on a whim to see if people are interested. If interest is shown we can start talking about times and format. Right now I'm thinking of combined text and voice chat lessons and possibly screen casts. Having a voice chat server appeals to me as you all can ask questions as I ""lecture.""

Here are some possible course topics (this is not complete)

For players:

**Basics:** How to play, how the numbers and dice work, what the game looks like in action.

**Character Creation and ""Advanced"" Character Creation:** How to go about making a character from scratch. Where to find more options for your characters. How to create a solid back story and personality for roleplay.

**Roleplay tips and table etiquette:** How to become the favorite person at the table. When to speak up, when to shut up, metagaming, advanced roleplaying tips, character evolution. Manners and how to make the DM love you.

And more!

For DMs 

**Basics:** How to DM. What it's like on the other side of the screen. ""Kick down the door"" vs ""roleplay"" group moods.

**World Building:** How to make a living, breathing world in which your characters can act, grow and have a great time. Adding depth, layers, history and more. Much more.

**Misc tips:** How to organize your game, how to keep the players happy in events of trouble, ""fake it 'till you make it"", interesting tidbits, anything I can think of that doesn't fit the other categories.

DnD is something that has been very positive in my life, and I want to share it with the rest of you. Sign up/give advice or ideas in the comments!

**EDIT**

Wow! It looks like there certainly is interest. This will definitely be getting off the ground in the coming weeks!

**IF YOU REGISTERED READ THIS**

Class time will most likely be one hour long, every Thursday night at 6:00PM PST. We well also have some sessions on Tuesdays as I am going on vacation this summer for two weeks and would like to finish the class before this. If this time conflicts with too many people please let me know via the course email. All class sessions will be recorded and then posted on r/rpg or r/rpgrecordings, depending on what I eventually decide.

If you registered, please send me an email at **RedditDndUniversity@gmail.com** with your name, if the class time works, and what you hope to get out of the class (DM tips, how to play, all of the above, etc.)

So far it looks like the class will be about six-eight weeks long, depending on how often we meet. Here's a VERY tentative schedule, it's subject to change at any moment (including the day of.)

**Week One** Thursday, May 27: Game basics. How to play, how the mechanics work. How to create a character on the numbers side. Suggested reading: *Player's Handbook 3.5* Skim through the classes section, races section, combat section, and as much else as you feel like. Don't read for comprehension, just skim it very lightly. 

**Week Two** Wednesday, June 2 AND Thursday, June 3:  Wed: Advanced character creation. More advanced players welcome. How to make a great backstory and a great personality. How to merge this with the stats. 

Thu: Table etiquette and RP tips. How to not be hated at the table. General rules to follow to have a smoother gaming experience and make friends at the table.

**Week Three** Thursday, June 10: Dungeon Mastering basics. How to DM on the technical level. How to make a simple story and guide the players down it, etc.

**Week Four** Wednesday, June 16 AND Thursday, June 17:

Wed: World building. Creating a living breathing world for your players and yourself. Maps, people, history etc.

Thu: Dungeon Mastery. This is where the huge amount of DMing advice will be. This might be an extended class period, or we might branch it into another one. Who knows.

So that's the basic schedule. Four week class. Don't forget I've never done this before, folks! I won't be perfect on the scheduling end and whatnot. Please shoot me an email at **RedditDndUniversity@gmail.com** and we'll get started the 22nd!

Do you like programming for the sake of both problem solving and subsequently coding it up? When I started programming, I loved it just for the sake of discovering the little nooks and cranies hidden in the language that few others know about; it made me feel as if I was peering inside the heads of giants. This quickly grew into a fascination with not really the design, but the many ways to implement some of those cooler features. Some features were easy to model and the intuition behind their design came naturally. Others wouldn't give away their secrets no matter how hard I tried to probe them; but no matter how hard or frequently I failed, it always just fed my fascination with them. This eventually became an academic interest and it continues to blow my mind each and every day. (I'm only slightly exagerating here)

During my freshman year of college, I had to take this functional programming course. It felt challenging: for the first time ever, I really had to think for a really long time before I started typing out a program; but at the same time, it was kind of satisfying. As cool as that was, it never really appealed to me; it felt as if I was just taught how to use a language that I didn't feel like I would ever use in practice (anyone here ever heard of OCaml?). But one day, my professor wrote a short snippet:

    let empty key = failwith ""not found""
    let update map key v = 
      fun x -&gt; 
        if x = key then 
          v
        else 
          map x

and when we copy and pasted it into our interpreter, we realized that we can just use it as if it was a mapping/dictionary:

    let map = update (update empty ""hello"" 42) ""world"" 43 in
    map ""hello"" (* this will return 42, and applying ""world"" will return 43 *)

in effect, we can use functions to build up our own dictionary! He then pointed out that we can do the same thing in python too!

    def empty(key):
        return None
    def update(map, key, val):
        return lambda x: v if x == key else map(x)

whoa! That got my attention. I may never use OCaml in the real world, but it was the perfect platform to use in demonstrating that functional programming isn't just about immutable objects; it was about how a seemingly simplistic programming language can be so expressive. It's about those little moments when everything just clicks into place. You know what I'm talking about :)

A rough syllabus:

1. Introduction to Lambda Calculus. Lambda Calculus is just the language of substituting one thing for another, don't get misled into thinking that it is complicated; it's like high school algebra (where you push symbols around and eventually substitute numbers for symbols) but without needing to worry about division (or in fact any operation except for substitutions). The point is that we're going to start small, and we're going to look at a bunch of cool features that we can incorporate into our programming language, and we're going to directly *encode* them into our tiny little language. It's like trying to fit a square peg into a circular hole, and succeeding :)
2. Operational Semantics - When we define a language, we often want to be able to figure out what a piece of code will do. This is called the operational semantics. We will also look at a simple imperative language in this section.
3. Induction for the manly man/woman - Programming languages are discrete structures that have smaller parts that share similar features; almost as if these features are ""recursive"" (look at a picture of an abstract syntax tree). As such, it's very easy to prove properties of programming languages, their semantics, and even properties of those proofs by induction. Unfortunately, the kind of mathematical induction most frequently taught in school is typically either difficult to use here or are sometimes not expressive enough. We will address this via a generalization known as well-founded induction principle.
4. Semantics by Translation - Sometimes, when I'm not quite sure how a certain piece of code in Brainf*ck does, I will try to translate it into an easier language and then analyze the resulting translated code. It's just like how you got through Spanish in high school/college - Google Translate.
5. Some cool language features - mutable data in lambda calculus, recursion, errors, pairs/tuples, lazy evaluation semantics, modules, concurrency, continuation passing, random and probably useless features that sound really cool and might be fun to hack around with
5. Axiomatic Semantics - Assigns meaning to a piece of code as a proof of its correctness (and from that proof, you know what the code will do), you might build a really simple correctness checker/verifier here, don't worry, I won't make you write your own theorem prover (although that is an active area of PL).
6. Denotational Semantics - Translation of a programming language into mathematical objects! It's more exciting than it sounds
7. A bit of domain theory - recursion for denotational semantics
8. Types - there's so much to cover here
9. More domain theory - in order to mode recursive types, you're going to have to take limits of sequences of domains now! In effect, how do you solve domain equations and furthermore the smallest/most compact domain satisfying those equations?
10. Even Moar Types!

Okay, this is extremely skewed: the topics overlap substantially, and 5-9 will likely cover the bulk of the course.

Who am I?

I'm currently a junior undergrad in computer science, but fear not, I have taken most of the pl courses offered at my school including the graduate foundational course and a graduate seminar; I am going to be a teaching assistant for our course on compiler construction and a research assistant. But above all, I reallllllly like this stuff.

Anyways, this is a perhaps lesser trodden path in compsci but is also one that people typically find to be extremely fascinating, and I would love to share my fascination with everyone, so I just want to see how many people out there would be potentially interested in this material.

A few months ago, a [Reddit blog post about us](http://blog.reddit.com/2012/08/university-of-reddit-explore-any.html) drove a large amount of traffic to this subreddit and we were drowned in class request posts and interest checks. At the time, it seemed like a good idea to disallow interest checks and have all requests be psoted at /r/URedditRequests.

That policy is now being reverted. Interest checks and class requests are now welcome, and /r/URedditRequests will be deleted.

Furthermore, we have, up until now, generally removed posts that are not about UReddit itself. That is not in line with the spirit of open discussion; from this point on, posts that are generally related to online classes or education (as long as they are not blatant spam) will be allowed.

the following is just a sketch of what i thought of so far: please bring your own ideas, i value them as very important!

I started thinking about an initial arguments list draft. Being a basic level class, i think the goal of it is best defined by the A1 level of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages, i.e.:
&gt;After this class you will be able to:
&gt;Understand and use familiar everyday expressions and very basic phrases aimed at the satisfaction of needs of a concrete type.
&gt;Introduce yourself and others and be able to ask and answer questions about personal details such as where you live, people you know and things you have.
&gt;Interact in a simple way provided the other person talks slowly and clearly and is prepared to help.

So, i came up with these arguments (with the necessary credit to the other language teachers on reddit, since i took inspiration from their classes):

    GRAMMAR/MISCELLANEOUS
    General sentence structure
    Verbs (conjugations, present tense, past simple, future simple)
    Numbers
    Common expressions
    Greetings
    Articles
    Formal and informal expressions
    Colors
    Family members
    Body parts
    Accented words

    PRACTICAL SITUATIONS:
    Buy food/order a meal
    Buy a train ticket
    Ask for general info/street directions/ask the time
    Buy something in a shop

    CULTURE:
    Food
    Politics
    Sports

I have started working on my blog, which would be the lessons' platform. Right now it is pretty bare. It is far from an acceptable form and it just contains a pretty lame introductory post, but if you are interested, it's [here](http://italianatentoni.wordpress.com). (don't make too much fun of it :-)

I would like to structure each lesson with a grammar section, but also with some culture/fun stuff.
I like slideshare as a tool to upload exercises and notes.
Most importantly, i would like to upload mp3s with the actual pronunciation of some of the lesson's stuff: in my english language experience, i realized how pronunciation does make the difference! An alternative to this would be youtube videos (maybe better).

Of course, some kind of live lesson would be great, but we would have to figure out the time for it and the tool for it: i like the idea of a shared notepad with audio conference capability (like a virtual classroom with a board, you know). Do you have any experience with Scriblink?

Some other ideas i was thinking of:
1 use my new twitter account (tentoni77) to post random thoughts/word of the day in italian-english, and answer questions.

[Based on my poll results](http://www.reddit.com/r/UniversityofReddit/comments/c1twn/poll_i_can_teach_over_a_dozen_different_courses/), I have decided to offer a course:

**Neural Basis of Cognition and Learning/Memory**

The brain is an incredibly complex structure that is still far from understood. Neuroscience as we know it today flourished only in the past century; the advent of advanced imaging techniques has enabled us to learn much more, as have many rare case studies.

This course will be focused on the neural basis of cognitive functions. The textbook for the course is Cognitive Neuroscience and Neuropsychology, (second edition) by Marie T. Banich. **THE BOOK IS NOT NECESSARILY REQUIRED.** Yes, I'll be teaching out of it often, but I have myself taken decently detailed notes on the entire book and will be distributing them. 

The class will be heavily supplemented with journal articles. Select readings from Kandel's Principles of Neuroscience will be distributed. Occasional excerpts from other texts will be provided.

Here is a list of relevant topics. Not all will necessarily be covered.

* Methods
* Hemispheric Specialization
* Motor Control
* Object recognition
* Spacial processing
* Attention
* Language
* Learning and Memory
* Executive Function
* Emotion
* Plasticity
* Cognitive Disorders

**Prerequisites**

A good introductory course in neuroscience would be very helpful. A course in neuroanatomy would also be very helpful, but we will make an effort to go over relevant neuroanatomy as necessary.

Those that have not had any education in neuroscience should contact me for direction in how to prepare for this course. If you have no neuroscience background and plan on buying the book, chapters 1 and 2 are a decent way to prepare.

**Mechanisms of Teaching**

I am still investigating several options. I will probably be hosting two or more weekly lectures and assigning one or more readings (such as a journal article or a textbook excerpt) per week.",,False,self,t5_2rqj9,True,,,True,t3_c28gx,http://www.reddit.com/r/UniversityofReddit/comments/c28gx/class_neural_basis_of_cognition_and_learningmemory/,

Unfortunately, [our Kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1918344721/open-compass) did not see the success we hoped for. Today is my birthday and the birthday gift I'd appreciate from you is a $10 donation to Open Compass in order to help us get off the ground this summer, in time for the Fall semester. All donors will be listed on the (soon to be made public) donors page if they like, and anyone leaving a mailing address will receive a handwritten thank-you note.

Here's the link:

Thank you to everyone that supports Open Compass, and thank you to our Board of Directors for working on this project with me despite the obstacles we've run into so far.

**Edit**: What will the donations go for? Well, Open Compass' platform has to run on powerful servers because it offers live video streaming of lectures for classes, full course management software, and so on, which is expensive. I can and have donated my own funds for this purpose, but, as a grad student, that hasn't been enough. Donations will be used to run the servers for development purposes so that we can finish off the beta early this summer, and the UReddit community will be the first to be table to take advantage of it all.",,False,self,t5_2rqj9,1367555938.0,,,True,t3_1dlbyr,http://www.reddit.com/r/UniversityofReddit/comments/1dlbyr/for_my_birthday_today_all_i_want_is_for_you_to/,moderator

**Starter Questions**

* By the completion of chapter 6 we find out that the Time Traveler has not only identified a surface dwelling species of man (Eloi), but also a underworld species (Murlocks). What are your theories as to how these two species of man segregated? 

* Previously the Time Traveler was wrongfully identifying the Eloi as a communist culture, but with the discovery of the Murlocks he begins to realize there was in fact a capitalistic approach. Rather than peace and happiness, the Eloi were frail and raised similar to cattle (lack of adults, technology, and true freedom to roam). Are there any other political outcomes we can see coming from Well's story that relates back to modern culture? (Ex - Cultural classes and boundaries)

* On page 68 (depending on your version) the Time Traveler discusses artificial selection. ""We improve our favorite plants and animals-and how few they are-gradually be selective breeding; now a new and better peach, now a seedless grape, now a sweeter and larger flower, now a more convenient breed of cattle. We improve them gradually, because our ideas are vague and tentative, and our knowledge is very limited; because Nature, too, is shy and show in our clumsy hands."" Here we see another detailed description of of a scientific method. Do you feel that combining fact and fiction provides a stronger base for believability?

In case you're unfamiliar, **ROM hacking** is the process of modifying a game (ROMs include games from many systems; NES, SNES, GBC, GBA, and PSX, to name a few) to accomplish something new. Common ROM hacks involve:

* Graphical improvements or re-imagingings
* Script rewrites or entirely new stories
* Level editing
* Adding entirely new features to games
* Translating games from one language to another

*****

As far as the class goes I'd like to either focus on translation hacking or general ROM hacking, whichever there is more interest in. If there's enough interest for both I might be willing to teach two separate classes. Translation hacking involves stuff like hacking fonts, dumping game scripts, tackling compression schemes, hacking menus, etc. General ROM hacking would be stuff like modifying crucical game data (enemy stats, spells, items, whatever), level editing, graphical hacking, etc.

# So, things I'd like your input on:

* What type of hacking you're interesting in: **translation** or **general**?
* What system you're most interesting in hacking: **NES, SNES, GBC, GBA, or other**?
* Any game in particular you're interested in hacking or think would set a good example.
* How much experience you have with emulation/programming in general?

**Edit:** Now that I've thought about this a bit more, I'd really prefer to teach with the GBA as our learning platform. It's a lot simpler and I think it'd be easier for you guys to learn. Also, full disclosure: most of my hacking experience is on GBA.

Note: I specialize in GBA games, but for anything other than assembly hacking I can teach for other systems. I do recommend GBA for more advanced stuff though since it is very simple compared to other systems. I didn't include NDS, PSX, or N64 since they are much more complicated and IMO, unsuitable for a beginner.

*****

Class Structure:

I'd prefer to do this in a group discussion format. Some form of chat with me screencasting would be ideal. I've only ever taught people over IM or IRC before and video would definitely help. I've never screencasted before so I'd really appreciate any advice on this.

I'm thinking of running some kind of math reading group starting mid-May.  I am a third year graduate student doing research in low-dimensional topology.  There probably aren't enough people with interest and background to do reading in my area, so I was thinking of a topic I should know (or know better) at the advanced undergraduate/beginning graduate student level.  I'd like to follow a textbook with lots of problems.  For the format, I (or better, we'd take turns) summarizing/digesting some reading and then do/discuss all the problems.  Topics I'm interested in with some book suggestions: Lie algebras (Humphreys) and/or Lie groups (Varadarajan), contact topology (Geiges), Riemann surfaces (Miranda), complex geometry (Huybrechts), PDEs, commutative algebra (Atiyah MacDonald), algebraic geometry.  Interested?  Other ideas? Comments?

edit: Thanks for all the interest in feedback!  I will mull over the responses and make a plan.  If I do AG, for which there seems to be quite a bit of interest, I will probably follow either Harris' First Course or Shafarevich Basic AG for the classical picture and concrete examples, and then go on to Hartshorne for the modern perspective of schemes and sheaf cohomology, etc.

So a lot of us may not have all the time in the world, but logic and reasoning are very important to a lot of what we do. My goal will be to make you are more reasonable person by teaching you fallacies, whole thinking (My own concept, I think, but very important to being logical), induction and deduction, how to read scientific studies, choosing your sources and a couple other things that will come up in relation to these.

**How Will the Class Work?**

Despite the large amount of material I want to cover, I plan on this being an easy class. This will all be introduced in a voice chat. We will talk about the day's topics and whatever coursework I assigned (At most a 250 word essay or hour long documentary or assigned Reddit browsing. I will challenge what you believe. 

There will be polls before the class so I can get a sense of how everyone feels on different topics. I hope to make some classes emotional (Whether I make you angry or sad or exasperated) so that you can see how it happens to you in a controlled setting and thus, later control it in your discussions with others. I can support any side of any argument regardless of my beliefs. You won't know what I really believe unless I tell you. 

Classes will be two hours on a weekend day, with a 15 minutes break (though I can't really stop you from leaving if you want to.) There will be no talking stick, I expect everyone to take their turn and no more. If I see someone talking expressly out of turn I will ask them to stop and let someone else get a word in. 

People of all viewpoints are welcome.


**Why am I qualified?**

Well my username is not helping me here. I got my name because I often take a devil's advocate role in the more political sites. It's a bit in my nature.

Anyway, I come from a very logical background. My family is mostly very logical and I spend a lot of time thinking logically. I can't prove any of this though and I honestly can't think how I would. I've written no papers. All I have is myself.

I am hoping for a small class but if it gets large I can do two (One Saturday, One Sunday). All time will be in Eastern Time USA. I will base the scheduled hours based on the geographic of who joins. I am thinking 4 PM (1600). That is 8 PM (2000) in London and 1 PM (1300) in California.

**Edit** I am on my way to work. I will respond to any questions when I get there.

**Edit1** I haven't left for work yet. My schedule got redone. I am glad to see this getting positive votes. I think at seven I will create the class.

Hey UoR reddit,

I'm interested in how this project could work, and so I decided to have a go at teaching a class. The subreddit is [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/kamasona_e_tokipona), and the UoR site for it is [here](http://ureddit.com/class/274).

I used UoR as a place to turn in assignments and make sure only those enrolled would be graded. The subreddit was for posting lessons.

I recorded some information about the class, but you can see that after awhile it become pointless. So, I didn't record anything for the last two weeks, but you can get a clear picture of how it went.

I'm curious what you all think of this. I think one of the steps to making UoR better is to get some data on how the courses are doing, and then figuring out what steps to take. So, what steps do you think UoR should take?

I do my lesson live, then use that 2 hours or so to condense that knowledge into a smaller video packed with information. You don't have to know how to draw, and if you don't, you can learn to draw basics and get decent results by following my tutorials.

So I've been debating whether to start a class for some time now. I'm a recent law school graduate that just took the bar in July. I have some down time before I start working in November and thought it might be an ideal time to run a class on Constitutional law.  Given Reddit's aversion to all things police, I thought a criminal procedure/fourth amendment class might be a popular class to run.

I'd be willing to throw together a syllabus and host a few live lectures a week, but I'm a bit concerned people losing interest in the class and fading out. I'd hate to put all of this together and then not end up with a class half way through. How interested are people in this topic? Would you be able to stay with it the entire way through?
  
Another consideration is, given that this is a legal topic, it might be fun to run the class as an actual law class. That is, I'd use the socratic method (for those of you who don't know what this means, it's when the professor calls on students at random to ""brief"" cases. An extreme example and mandatory viewing for all law students comes from [The Paper Chase](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZJEhlIefxA)). This could give redditors outside the legal profession the opportunity to experience how a law class is run and perhaps show redditor contemplating law school what they'd be in for. I'm not sure, however, exactly how we could pull this off over the internet.

Anyway, if you're interested and have any ideas on how you'd like the class to be run, please post your thoughts. If enough people are into it and we can figure out how to run the class, I'd be happy to set up a class page and we could take it from there.",,False,self,t5_2rqj9,False,,,True,t3_cz6g0,http://www.reddit.com/r/UniversityofReddit/comments/cz6g0/fourth_amendment_class/,

The course will last for 8 weeks, but you can easily complete it in as short as 2 if you increase your pace of study (or if you are reviewing stuff have already studied).

The Syllabus will be done in Units, instead of dates, to allow people to go at their own pace.  The course length is 12 Units, with 10 Units introducing 3-5 new characters and 2 review units.

I am shooting to have everything set up and ready by 4/15.  Sound good?

1: You should have a graphics tablet. A [Wacom](http://www.wacom.com/index.html) tablet is awesome, get one. You can find a Bamboo tablet for under $80 online, or get a bigger tablet if you are serious about drawing.

2: You will need Photoshop. Crac- erm, I mean pay for it like everyone else does. Yeah, it's not like you need to **pirate** on the high seas of Thunder **Bay**.

3: You *can* do this course on pen and paper, but I highly suggest against it. I'm a digital artist, manipulating in Photoshop is easier, faster, and much more dynamic than paper.
