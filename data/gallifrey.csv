It's not that the old ones didn't walk around saying ""Delete, Delete"" either, though I know that grates on some.

It's the way that the original Cybermen - as a whole culture - replaced their body parts bit by bit. It wasn't one psychopath deciding to convert everyone like it was it is in the reboot; it was everyone willingly converting themselves, piecemeal fashion over an extended period, to extend their lives. It's quite chilling and it's easy to see the same happening to us. 

Imagine this. You are getting old, but medical technology is advancing at an incredible rate. First your hip fails, but that is easily replaced. Then your knees, and then your elbows. All simple body parts - you are still most definitely ""you"". 

A little while later, you replace a few more parts - a bionic ear, new lenses for your eyes and new teeth. But really, it's all just bits and bobs. It probably disturbs you a little that these parts are all that will remain in your coffin after your body rots away, but ""Wow!""- you can see, hear and chew properly again.

Then a big one. You get a synthetic heart. It's a little sobering, but in the end, it's just a muscle isnt it? No emotions are held in your heart. Not really. Okay, your blood doesn't pump faster in quite the same way when you get excited, but you are still ""You"". You still think the way you did, and for the most part still 'feel' the same. That's all that matters.

This process goes on, bit by bit, and the years of extra life turn to decades. Organs are replaced, one by one, until there are only a few left in your body. If you are honest to yourself, emotions are odd now. It's surprising how much of how you feel things is actually tied into your organs, nerves and endocrine system. And skin, too (replacing that was very odd). But your brain is intact. You are still ""you"". And so are your friends and family, even if they look a little different now.  

Then you have a stroke. It destroys part of your brain, and it's very close to 'all over red rover'. Luckily, though, nanotechnology has advanced so far now that the function of the part of the brain you have lost can be replicated by micro-machinery and circuitry. A bit of your brain is replaced, but you are still ""you"". You haven't died yet. You are still alive. 

Over the next few years, more and more of your brain dies and is replaced. Each time you check to see if you still ""feel the same"". Are you the same person? Or did you die somewhere along they way? And each time you think - I am pretty much the same as I was before. Hardly changed at all, really. 

The day comes when a century has passed since that first hip replacement. Almost all of you has been replaced. You are 5% organic, 95% machine. Your remaining brain is closer to the size of a cat's than a human's but the important stuff is still there. It must be - you still feel like ""you"". Admittedly, it's hard to compare the current ""you"" to you as you were when you were still a full human, but you have no doubt that version 78.0 feels almost exactly the same as 77.88. And the bits that do feel different are frankly an improvement: OS 77 wasted a lot of process time ""feeling"" things that didn't really matter to you any more. 

If one thing still makes you feel excited though, it's OS 80.0. It's going to be so much more efficient. You will even be able to dual boot when the organic matter isn't operating fast enough...

**TL:DR** Becoming a cyberman is a slippery slope into dehumanization. People aren't brainwashed to go to conversion chambers. They go of their own free will. Anything to stay alive.

The Weeping Angels themselves represent death and old age, and the fact that they only move when you aren’t looking is a metaphor for how life will pass you by if you fail to appreciate or savor it.

Case in point: Larry Nightingale, the blogger fanatic obsessed with the mysterious DVD extra who we the audience know as the Doctor. It is implied that Larry spends his time sitting around, watching bad movies, and blogging about conspiracy theories. Larry is so obsessed with unknowable mysteries and trivialities that he is missing out on real life, letting it flutter by while he posts on message boards about DVD features.

Detective Billy Shipton represents the antithesis to Larry. Billy lives his life in the moment, never regretting the things he did not do. When Sally asks him why he cut work to ask her on a date, he simply responds “because **life is short** and you are hot.” Billy understands that life is a precious gift that is not to be wasted, while Larry is so caught up with trivialities that he is literally missing his life.

When Sally visits an elderly Billy in the hospital late into the episode, Billy proffers his hands. “Look at my hands, Sally. They are old man’s hands. How did that happen?” It’s a question that everyone who lives to a ripe old age ends up asking themselves: where did all that time go? The irony of “Blink” is that the Angels are all too real. Aging, regret, and a sense of missed opportunity follow us all throughout our lives. Moffat has simply personified these abstract concepts into a creature we happen to associate with death and the afterlife. The fact that the Angels are made of stone represents the immovable, objective nature of death and its surety; it also adds to the creepy factor by calling up images of graveyards and tombstones. 

After his terrifying encounter with the Weeping Angels, Larry appears to be a changed man. Having literally stared death in the face, he now appreciates life and wants to spend it meaningfully by pursuing a relationship with Sally.  But Sally herself has become preoccupied with the pursuit of the unknown, obsessing over the mystery of how everything fits together. Only her chance encounter with the Doctor is able to put her mind at ease and allow her to move on with her life, finally at peace and free of the Angels.

As the final montage of the statues scattered across the world makes clear, the Angels are all around us, both literally and metaphorically. They are simply waiting for us to “blink”, waiting for us to underappreciate the value of our own lives, waiting for us to let our guard down and let our lives pass us by so they can swoop in and snatch us into oblivion.

1369247583.0,338,self.gallifrey,1eulsf,The Doctor and the devil (x-post from r/doctorwho) [FINALE SPOILERS],400,62,205,http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/1eulsf/the_doctor_and_the_devil_xpost_from_rdoctorwho/,"This is a wicked long one, delving into recurring themes in Moffat's Who.

Moffat has, in a very subtle and brilliant way, included a theme in his seasons comparing the Doctor to the devil. There are some VERY overt references to it as the show progresses, but also lots and lots of more subtle references. With all the evidence I’m about to show you, it has to be intentional.

I’ll start with the subtle comparisons. One thing Steven Moffat has loved to do is show how the Doctor is like the monsters in his stories. Over and over we see episodes where the ancient lonely monster is compared to the Doctor at the end of the episode. This all started with a line Moffat wrote in Season 2’s The Girl in the Fireplace: *“The Doctor and the monsters. It seems you cannot have one without the other.”* Ever since Moffat took over the show, he’s taken that idea and ran with it.

1. **The Beast Below(s5e2) –** *“This dream must end, the world must know, we all depend on the Beast Below.”* The poem is directly about the Starwhale, but it is also DEFINITELY about the Doctor.  Because as we see in the episode, the Starwhale is incredibly ancient, the last of his kind, and only interferes with the planet *“when children are crying”*. Moffat intentionally wrote the Starwhale to mirror the Doctor, so when the final poem is read by Amy as the episode fades out, we are supposed to apply it to the Doctor. This is the first moment in Moffat’s writing where he uses a word synonymous with the devil: the Beast. Right there in his second episode as show-runner. That word will come back.

2. **The God Complex(s6e11) –** A false beast is worshiped in this episode. At the end of the episode as it is dying, this beast says *“An ancient creature, drenched in the blood of the innocents. Drifting in space through an endless shifting maze. For such a creature, death would be a gift.”* He then says *“I wasn’t talking about myself.”* He was talking about the Doctor. The Doctor is intentionally compared to this beast.

3. **Asylum of the Daleks(s7e1) –** This one is less so, but the Daleks call the Doctor “The Predator”. Of course he is, to them. But there is one line intentionally comparing the Doctor to the Daleks. He says *“You find hatred beautiful?”* And the Daleks reply *“perhaps that is why we have never been able to kill you.”*

4. **A Town Called Mercy(s7e3) –** We’re starting to kick it up a notch. *“When I was a child, my favorite story was about a man who lived forever, but whose eyes were heavy with the weight of all he had seen. A man who FELL FROM THE STARS.”* Of course, this man isn’t the Doctor, instead it’s the cyborg that is willing to destroy the whole town for his revenge. But he’s intentionally described in the vein of the Doctor. At the end of the episode, this is said: *“They’ve got their own angel watching out for them. Their very own angel who fell from the stars.”* Throughout the episode we’ve seen the similarities between the Doctor and the cyborg, so, just like in the Beast Below, the ending monlogue has two meanings. And notice that phrase again: “angel who fell from the stars.” An angel who fell from heaven. This is the way the devil is described in ancient mythology. It mirrors **Luke 10:18: “I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven...”**

5. **The Rings of Akhaten(s7e6) –** The old god is worshiped by the people of Akhaten. But it turns out he’s more of a devil than a god. He’s a terrible fire demanding child sacrifice and threatening to consume everything. *“Oh you like to think you're a god. But you're not a god. You're just a parasite. Eaten out with jealousy and envy and longing for the lives of others. You feed on them. On the memory of love and loss and birth and death and joy and sorrow.”* This monster, a terrible god, mirrors the Doctor. In fact, in the episode the people call him Grandfather, and the Doctor mentions to Clara that he had a granddaughter. This is to intentionally show us that the Doctor and the monster are the same, once again.

6. **Hide(s7e8) –** The monster in this episode is once again overtly compared to the Doctor. *“Every lonely monster needs a companion,”* he says at the end. He’s talking about  himself and Clara. Both he and the monster were running across all of time to find their companion. Since this is intentional, anything said about the monster in this episode thematically applies to the Doctor. And there is a significant reference to the devil. The Doctor says to the monster: *“You hide, SEEKING WHOM YOU MAY DEVOUR.”* This is ripped directly from **1 Peter 5:8, “the devil walks around like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour.”**

7. **The Crimson Horror(s7e10) –** The Doctor is introduced as *“my monster”*. He is the monster in the episode, in direct opposition to the “religious” Mrs. Gillyflower. More on this in a second.

That’s it for monster-Doctor comparisons pertaining to the devil. Notice how they became much more frequent in Season 7, probably because Moffat told the other writers what was up.

Now for the direct mentions of the word “devil”. Is it a coincidence that every single time that word is put in a script it refers to the Doctor?

1. **The Wedding of River Song(s6e13)  –** This is the quote that started my theory. Even though it was hinted throughout Seasons 5 and 6, it was only after this episode aired that I realized what Moffat was doing. *“Imagine you were dying, and in terrible pain. And just when you think it couldn’t get any worse, you look up and see the face of* **THE DEVIL HIMSELF**.” Now, this is the Doctor speaking to a dying Dalek. It’s a clever quote, because it’s describing himself AND the Dalek. But it’s definitely describing himself. He calls himself the devil.

2. **Hide(s7e8) –** We’ve already been over how the Doctor was compared to the monster, who was compared to the devil. But there’s a more overt reference. *“The presence was accompanied by a dreadful knocking, as if* **THE DEVIL HIMSELF** *demanded entry.”* Now, again, this is about the ghost in the house. But the Doctor’s entrance to this episode is loud knocking that exactly matches the knocking the “ghost” does later. He demands entry. That’s on purpose.

3. **The Crimson Horror(s7e10) –** A bit of a throw-away line, but since the writers all know what’s up, it is definitely there on purpose. Again, Mrs. Gillyflower’s nemesis in this episode is the Doctor. He is the one she needs to avoid to acheive her plan. In one scene she spills the salt, then throws some over her shoulder and says *“to keep* **THE DEVIL** *at bay.”* Clever writing.

4. **Nightmare in Silver(s7e11) –** Another clever throw-away, but can’t be ignored given the sheer amount of these references. The cyberplanner talking to Clara says, *“He knows who you are. Oh, he hasn’t told you?* **SLY DEVIL** *”* and is immediately cut off by the Doctor taking back control of the body.

That’s it for actual mentions of the word “devil”. Again, much more prevalent in Season 7 leading up to the reveals that Moffat’s promised us.

Now let’s see the other names of the Doctor throughout Moffat’s Who. You might be surprised how often they are synonymous with a devil.

1. **The Pandorica Opens(s5e12) –** *“There was a goblin, or a trickster. Or a warrior. A nameless, terrible thing, soaked in the blood of a billion galaxies. The most feared being in all the cosmos. And nothing could stop it, or hold it, or reason with it. One day it would just drop out of the sky and tear down your world.”* Turns out it’s the Doctor.

2. **A Good Man Goes to War(s6e7) –** *“The Man Who Lies.”* Also called this in many other episodes.

3. **The Name of the Doctor(s7e13) –** Even though I had my theory over a year ago, this episode basically confirms it. *“Welcome to the final resting place of the Cruel Tyrant. The Slaughterer of the Ten Billion. The Vessel of the Final Darkness... he will have other names before the end. The Storm. The Beast.”*

Are there other things in the episodes, besides names or monsters, that support this theory? Why yes!

1. Rule One: the Doctor lies. This has only been “Rule One” since Moffat took over. Because it fits his grand scheme. The devil is the father of all lies. This rule is usually quoted flippantly by either the Doctor or River, but in The Name of the Doctor when he promises Clara *“this won’t hurt a bit”* and then it does, he looks her dead in the face and gravely spits out: *“I lied.”*

2. The Doctor has a militarized CHURCH trying to bring him down for the good of the universe.

3. If you’ve been running your whole life from the fact that you’re the devil, would you have guilt? Absolutely.  In **Amy’s Choice(s5e7)** he tells the Dream Lord (who is himself): *“There’s only one person in the universe who hates me as much as you do.”* Hint, it’s himself.

4. Similarly, in **The God Complex(s6e11)**, he opens the door of his room to find his most feared thing. *“Of course. WHO else?”* He’s seen himself (probably the John Hurt version, which I’ll get to in a minute).

5. And here’s **my favorite** little Moffatism. River Song, the Doctor’s one true pair, says the phrase *“Let there be light”*, a phrase attributed to God, in two separate episodes. Once in The Big Bang. And once in Forest of the Dead, her very first episode!

Now how does this nicely tie up in the most recent episode, with the John Hurt reveal? Because the devil is WHO the Doctor is. It’s the answer to the question. It can be summed up by his name, a unique name, which he eventually tells to River, and which he dropped in favor of “the Doctor”. For instance, it could be summed up in the name Satan, or Beelzebub, although I doubt the name will ever be said out loud to the audience. **The point of the question is not THE NAME, but WHO HE REALLY IS.**

 John Hurt’s Doctor, then, is most likely the original Doctor, before he took the name of Doctor. He did something so awful, so incredibly terrible in the universe’s future (his past) that he was the most destructive and evil force in all the universe. Maybe John Hurt’s Doctor even destroyed the universe. *“I watched creations freeze and burn. I was there when time ran out. Moment by moment until nothing remained. NO time. NO space. JUST ME.”* **(Rings of Akhaten)**

He somehow escaped into the past and regenerated into the first Doctor. He then took the name of Doctor, and ran from his past, vowing to be a healer from that point on. *“I said he was me. I never said he was the Doctor. My name, my real name, that is not the point. The name I chose is the Doctor. The name you choose, it’s like a promise you make. He is my secret.”* **(Name of the Doctor)**

He has been running from his terrible past ever since he took the name Doctor. *“The oldest question in the universe. The question that must never be answered! Hidden in plain sight! The question you’ve been running from ALL YOUR LIFE! Doctor Who? Doctor WHO? DOC TOR WHO?”* **(Wedding of River Song)**

*“Doctor who? It’s more than just a secret, isn’t it.”* **(Girl in the Fireplace)** Yes, it’s more than JUST a secret. It’s a man. The past version of himself. John Hurt’s version. The devil.

He’s running from his terrible past, but he can’t escape it. He’s a good man now, but he can’t undo what he did. Despite all his best intentions, nothing can make up for what he’s done. And he always lets his companions down. He tells Amy she CAN’T have faith in him, because he can’t save her. He tries, but he can’t. He is the most terrible being that has ever lived.

Fitting that he ends up buried on a fiery graveyard planet that looks [*suspiciously like hell.*](http://redrocketrising.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Trenzalore.jpg)

*

**History:**

Time Lord Society as we know it, had three founders: Rassilon, Omega, and The Other. As a species Gallifreyans always had an affinity towards time, and it wasn't until one school-boy wrote an essay with the idea that by having the nearby star go supernova, that time-lords could then travel through time. This boy received the lowest grade for this assignment, Omega. Rassilon however was interested in the idea, and the two along with The Other began to plan Time Lord Society.

Omega piloted a ship, with the fabled Hand Of Omega device and caused the Star to go supernova, however his life was lost in the process. What was thought to be an accident, was in fact a power play from Rassilon who trapped Omega in a dimension of anti-matter. It was around this time that Rassilon and The Other came up with the idea of TARDIS, regeneration, and the looms. The last of which was a direct result of Rassilon's showdown with Pythia, whose curse left the Time Lords barren. Many weeks after the battle, the Other disappeared along with the Hand of Omega. At that time, the visions of the three Time-Lords put their civilization front and center as the most powerful race in the galaxy. Many artifacts are left over from this time, and all three founders celebrate a day; some for glory, and Others for shame.

One year, after the disappearance of The Other, the last living born Time Lord disappeared.
Not much is known about the Time Lords until the time of the Doctor, at which point many of the events that led to a series of Time Wars, and ended with The Last Great Time War and the disappearance of the Time Lords.

**Culture:**

All Time Lords are Gallifreyan, but not all Gallifreyan are Time Lords. In fact a good portion of Gallifreyans live in the wild, in a tribal society. 

Time Lords will belong to chapters in their society. There are two conflicting versions of this:

One version says that Time Lord procreate sexually, and have proper families. Not much is known about these.

Another version has Time Lords Loomed into Great Houses. The Houses are living things put forth by the decrees of Rassilon, and each House has an appointed number of Time Lords it can house. Upon death or banishment from a house, a new Time Lord is loomed into the world, fully grown but with the mental capacity of a toddler.

In their early days, all Time Lords hunted down the Great Vampires, and even to the days of the Doctor each TARDIS, carried a decree that called for any Time Lord to exterminate the leader of the Great Vampires on sight. However, these barbaric traditions were eventually phased out, much like the infamous Death Zone which would host dangerous species from all Time and Space.

In the days of the Doctor, the society of Time Lords mostly stayed on Gallifrey and did their respective jobs. Any travel outside of Gallifrey was for academic purposes, any other behavior was seen as Renegade and odd. The most famous renegade Time Lord was known as, The Doctor. In fact many of his classmates including The Rani, The Master, and The Monk became renegade Time-Lords, all though their actions usually caused a direct conflict with those of their former classmate, The Doctor.

Time Lord Society was led by a Cardinal, a Castillion, and a Lord President who would meet with the High Council of the Time Lords.

**Military:**

The Time Lords did not have an advanced military system, and as a result they struggled greatly against the Daleks in the Last Great Time War, all though TARDISes built for combat were used. Instead, many of the Time Lord weapons incapacitated or required greater intellect and trickery to use. 

The most famous weapon was used by the Doctor to end the Sontaran Invasion, it was known as the De-Mat Gun. 

**Time-Travel Devices:**

The Time-Lords had two means of time-travel for many millennia it was the TARDIS or Time And Relative Dimensions in Space, however for years before the Time-War the TARDIS was phased out in favor of the more personal Time-Rings. Many time-lords favored it for independent travel, as a TARDIS would require a crew of six.

**Time-Lord Genealogy:**

Every Time Lord born after the Supernova, was given 12 regeneration cycles for a total of thirteen lives. Some Time Lords were given further cycles as a reward for various deeds, and it was thought that Rassilon had found a way to gain infinite regeneration cycles. It is unknown if the regeneration was a physical, or genetic thing. All though the Time-Lady, River Song was able to regenerate after the death of the Time Lords.

Time-Lords also have two hearts along with a third DNA string that gives them their Time-Lord characteristics. This allows for them to have super-human stamina, agility, and strength. All though some of this may have more to do with regeneration. Their wounds are also known to heal within a day if non-lethal. This along with regeneration allows for Time Lords to live into thousands of years.

**Gallifrey:**
Gallifrey exists on its Time-Stream, and time travel in its past and future is prohibited except for repopulation of extinct species. All though there is a physical location, the exact coordinates are a closely guarded secret. When the Doctor, sealed the Time War, all clones of Gallifrey along with Gallifrey itself disappeared from all time and Space. This led to the Time Lords fading into myth and legend.

**The Presence of the Time-Lords in the Universe:**

This can only be described as pre-Time-War and post-Time-War.

Pre-Time-War: 
Seeing a Time-Lord was uncommon, but the race was famous in the universe. All though the genealogy of a Time Lord was guarded secret, many of the space-clinics could still offer treatment to a Time-Lord. 

Post-Time-War: Many have not heard, or even believe the Time Lords ever existed. It is rumored that one Time-Lord is still active in the universe, all though it is believed that he died on the third planet in the Sol System, Earth. Shortly after, all records of Time Lords disappeared from all known-databases.

**The Effects of the Time Lords on the Universe:**

All though it is unknown how much of the universe has been shaped by the actions of this great race. It is known that many humanoid species, most famously: The Human Beings, were in fact guided to by Rassilon in the early days when he meddled with the evolution of planets.

The renegade Time-Lord known as the Doctor, is perhaps the most famous meddler in time, and is seen as a great healer and warrior of many planets.

.

With that I would like to thank you for reading, and all though many of our questions have been answered about what happened to this race, many more remain.

I don't think it's necessarily a long running plot thread, either. I propose that the copy of 101 Places to See that Clara brings to Akhaten was her *mother's* copy of the book, not hers. The leaf given to Grandfather was her mother's ""page one"", where the leaf we saw in the Bells of Saint John was Clara's ""page one"".

That sounds a little ridiculous, you might be saying. Two different books? C'mon Stormwatch, she obviously just inherited her mother's book. Not so fast, I say. Take a look at [this screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/tNisYdo.jpg) of the book in The Bells of Saint John. Something is missing. Something crucial to the plot of The Rings of Akhaten, in fact. [This](http://i.imgur.com/zRVxiny.jpg) is what I'm referring to. You can [spot it](http://i.imgur.com/h1BIPvG.jpg) at the end of the episode as well, just before Clara gives up the leaf.

Now you're thinking: ""I remember the teardrop scene, though. Clara flips a page backward, going from her name and ages back one page to her mother's name before she cries on it. It's the same book, she just put her own name on the second page!"" To that, I provide you with [this image](http://i.imgur.com/zDUthWd.jpg), from Bells of Saint John. The teardrop scene where the page flips between her name and her mother's was an editing trick, meant to show the parallel between the two books.

So here's my theory (complete speculation incoming at this point): Clara and her mother both had a copy of the book. I'm guessing that Ellie bought a second copy of the book to give to Clara. Why would she do that instead of giving her her own copy? She didn't *plan* on dying. She expected to be able to keep her own copy as well. That way her and Clara could live their lives, traveling and having great experiences. Occasionally they would travel together, sure, but sometimes they would travel separately. They would then be able to get together and share their experiences together over their diaries, reminiscing about their time together while planning for the future.

[FINALE SPOILERS],339,57,259,http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/1enofz/i_think_youve_all_missed_something_major_in_your/,"**EDIT: I HAVE WRITTEN A POST CATEGORICALLY CHRONICLING THE MANY ALLUSIONS OF THE DOCTOR AND THE DEVIL IN MOFFAT'S WHO. IT'S LONG BUT IT'S A GOOD READ: [The devil and the Doctor](http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/1eq0lm/thematic_allusions_between_the_doctor_and_the/)**

We were supposed to find out about the Doctor's biggest secret in this episode. WHO he is, that he's been running from ""all his life"". And in a way, we did. The Great Intelligence told us.

The Great Intelligence called the Doctor ""blood-soaked"". He said he killed 10 billion people at his final battle at Trenzalore. He said that was one of his more minor skirmishes. He said the Doctor will be known by other names in the future: ""The Storm. The Beast.""

This is the Doctor's biggest secret: he is the ultimate evil in the universe's future. He probably destroys the ENTIRE UNIVERSE in the future. That's what the Silence are trying to stop. That's why the militarized church is out to get him. That's why the Pandorica was built for him. To save the future of the universe.

But it's not his future. It's HIS PAST. That's the beauty of time travel. It already happened for him, in the past. That's **""the secret you've been running from ALL YOUR LIFE. Doctor Who?"" (Wedding)** He is the destroyer of worlds. **""I was there when time ran out. Moment by moment until NOTHING remained. NO time. NO space. JUST ME."" (Akhaten)**

And his real name reflects that, whatever it is. That's who John Hurt is playing. The original him. BEFORE he CHOSE the name ""Doctor"". He destroyed the universe, perhaps he had no choice. But he escaped back into the past, regenerated into William Hartnell, and made a promise to himself. To be the Doctor. To be a healer. And he's been at it for 11 regenerations.

But what's done is done. The secret he's been running from all his life, is who he really, originally was. John Hurt's incarnation. The Destroyer of Worlds. The original evil.

Basically, he was the devil.

EDIT: The_Muensters pointed out that the Doctor tells a Dalek he's ""the devil himself"" in The Wedding of River Song. That's not the only time. It's been alluded to over and over in the last three seasons under Moffat. I've had this theory for over a year, and each episode just seems to confirm it to me again. Most recently, the GI in this episode called him ""the Cruel Tyrant, the Vessel of the Final Darkness, THE BEAST.""

&gt;“I decided that if we weren’t going to be involved that I would get together with Colin [Baker] and Sylvester [McCoy] and make our own little special… If we can possible manage it, we’re going to get into the 50th anniversary special whether we’re invited or not!”

So it seems like nothing is set in stone as of yet, but we might get some kind of announcement within the coming weeks(Assuming Peter is not the only one being called in by the BBC to discus anniversary plans). So there's still a chance that the BBC just hasn't discussed plans with the actors yet, and even if they're not in the special, perhaps we'll get one featuring 5, 6, and 7. Although I wonder why Peter didn't mention Tom or Paul :(.

It slowly introduces the Doctor (the scene with the conspiracy nut is brilliant) and establishes him as thoroughly alien. It shows that he's not merciless (he wants to give the Nestene Consciousness a chance before using the anti-plastic) and that he likes to have fun but takes things seriously. And it establishes the Ninth Doctor as a particular incarnation so he stands apart from the rest (his anguish when talking about the Time War, his casual disdain for the stupid apes of Earth). It also introduces his TARDIS and his sonic screwdriver.  
  
It also focuses heavily on Rose, establishing her main characteristics as an aimless girl bored with life, introduces her boyfriend and mother who would become recurring characters and plots her journey from wariness of the Doctor to standing up for him and saving the day at the end.  
  
But most importantly for me, it's ***so cheesy***. The dummies, the garbage bin, the plastic Mickey, the terrible CGI blob of the Nestene Consciousness, the way Rose saves the day (""I got the Bronze!"")... it's all wonderfully cheesy and I think this is the biggest thing to take away from *Rose*: it thoroughly establishes the tone of the show as a cheesy fun ride that takes itself seriously but never enough to ruin the fun. This is not something that you can take away from, say, *Blink*, so why is that offered as a way to get people into the show?

First things first. I started watching with the reboot and only the past few months have I really gotten into and had access to the classic episodes. Thanks mainly to a lot of helpful people here. 

I just think that sometimes fans, any fans from Trek to Twilight, can get a bit of an ego and think they are better than ""casual"" fans. IMO i'll welcome anyone to the whovian family if it spreads interest in the show. I heard some people complain about the live 12th announcement and that it was something that athletes or reality shows tend to do. But for a scifi show especially a 50 year old scifi show to be this popular worldwide that it was broadcast live like that is a compliment to what the show has become. 

The way I look at the show is that because its Doctor Who I love everything about it. That may be naive but that's how I see it. There are complaints about retcons, writing gaps, solving the regeneration limit etc. but maybe we should just enjoy the show as it is episode by episode and not worry so much. In 7's Remeberance of the Daleks they pretty much referenced themselves as a tv show. Which was awesome and hilarious. 

For some reason there is always someone reminding me that I'm not as big of a fan as someone else. Like there is some hierarchy of fandom. ""Oh you watch the reboot but not the classics..."" Or ""oh you've seen the classics but not the recons.."" or ""oh you haven't read the books or heard audiobooks?""

- Clara Oswin Oswald - Lee Harvey Oswald assassinated JFK the day before DW started.
- Harvey in *Asylum of the Daleks* is obviously also related to this.
- We have a past and future [and present](/spoiler) Clara, summing up the entire premise of the show: time travel.
- She's a bartender (looking after adults), governess (looking after children), and 'Junior Entertainment Manager' which is basically what the show is (seriously, I thought it was the weirdest job title ever until this was pointed out).

I'm interested in knowing what moments sum her up for you - the moments which defined her character and her relationship to the Doctor. For me, is is undoubtedly her moment with Ten in *'The Fires of Pompeii'*, with the Doctor's hands on the lever ready to erupt Vesuvius. The way she placed her hands on top of his and looked him in the eye was truly beautiful. She knew the Doctor couldn't do it himself, and that he needed someone to help him share the guilt. Though the moment is brief and passes very quickly, it was at that point I knew she was something different.

Anyone else?,266,58,116,http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/182hfr/i_have_enjoyed_season_7_immensely_anyone_else/,"This is, obviously, in response to the downing on season 7 thread.  I've seen a ton of people complaining about the most recent season so far, but does anyone really like it, like me?

Asylum of the Daleks was fantastic, I thought.  Great opener, Daleks have always been my favorite villain, callbacks to the classic series, and a lot of cool foreshadowing (when the Doctor looks on the map to see where Oswin is, her icon is literally a Dalek; he definitely knew all along).  I've seen in probably five or six times now, and I love it.

Dinosaurs on a Spaceship and A Town Called Mercy.  Maybe not the best episodes ever, but still pretty damn strong.  Both I thought were well written and suspenseful, and A Town Called Mercy particularly emotionally.  Maybe there isn't a direct thread between these, but you can totally see the Doctor spinning out of control.  I happen to subscribe to the theory that the whole season happens after The Angels Take Manhattan, and that this is his last bit of grief before giving up on the Ponds.

The Power of Three.  Eh.  Admittedly, but they can't all be winners.

The Angels Take Manhattan, while I do believe was too abrupt of a sendoff for the Ponds, and would have liked a longer, more plotted out departure, the episode itself was awesome.  The mechanic of the book locking the future was really cool, and the Angels were actually pretty scary in this one again, unlike Time of Angels/City of Whatever, which was a terrible episode.  Also, I'm a sucker for film noir.

The Christmas Special.  Outstanding, fantastic episode.  The on-screen chemistry between Oswin and the Doctor absolutely sparkles.  I love the idea of him having a companion who can really keep up with him.  Bringing back and even origin story-ing the Great Intelligence?  Love it, love it even more with Gandalf/Magneto playing it. The twist at the end, though, Oswin's fate and all that?

[Spoilers],238,38,54,http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/1gr5kr/my_ludicrous_hurtdoc_theory_spoilers/,"I've seen a lot of theories about John Hurt's Doctor. Most of them put him somewhere in the Timeline as a part of the sequence of Doctors that we know--either as number 0, 8.5, or a future Doctor. 

My theory is a little crazier. I think John Hurt is The Could've Been King. He is a Doctor that, through one chain of events in the Time War, rose to power on Gallifrey. He negated the need to resurrect Rassilon, and somehow managed to win. The way he did it though, it was brutal and cruel. It made The Doctor into something he never was and never wanted to be.

When The Doctor saw this chain of events about to happen, he chose a different path, one that denied leadership and instead focused on just fighting on the battlefield. The Time War being what it was though, The Could've Been King still paradoxically existed. Angry about his timeline being changed, he led his army of ""Meanwhiles and Neverweres"" (or, all the Time Lords that The Doctor saved because of his cruel and calloused leadership, but died in order to keep The Doctor from breaking his promise) into the war as well. This new Timeline also necessitated the resurrection of Rassilon and led to his ""Final Sanction"" 

Seeing no other choice, the only thing that would save the universe is if the Time Lords and the Daleks killed each other off in a place where they couldn't use the rest of the Universe as a weapon. He placed the Time Lock and ran away.

HurtDoc is The Could've Been King. Not the warrior version, but the Doctor after the war. Full of regret, trying to justify his actions.

I know, I know, it's Ludicrous. It was still fun to think up something different. It does solve a few problems though.

1. Clara didn't see him because he technically never existed. It was only The Doctor entering the Time Stream that allowed him to be seen, because The Doctor knew of his paradoxical existence.

2. The Doctor can still talk about the Time War and the fact that he ended it. The big secret is that he could have saved his people by committing horrible acts, and in one timeline he did *just that*.

3. It doesn't muck up the numbering, because HurtDoc is and isn't The Doctor. 

4. The Doctor gets to keep his name, because he never actually broke the promise. It was a part of him that *could've*, but never got a chance to.

**TL;DR**: I think HurtDoc is The Could've Been King, a version of The Doctor from an erased Timeline.

Yes, it's the famous line from poet Alexander Smith. Also note how Moffat loves to take lines of poetry (""something old, something new"") and weave it into a big culmination. He also loves to have one point in time be fundamentally crucial to all of time and space (Amy's wedding night, the Doctor's death).

I believe that Christmas will be some wibbley-wobbly point in time central to all of the universe and possibly central to the introduction (or reintroduction?) of Jenna Louise Coleman's character.

One Cyberman is superfast and can snipe through a small window from half way across a courtyard and is capable of multiple types of distraction and trickery with removable body parts. An army of Cybermen just walks into bullets.

I actually think there's a reasonable explanation for it this time. This version of the Cybermen seem to have a distributed intelligence. At the end the Cyberplanner is able to pull in the processing power of all his army on the chess problem when the Doctor distracts him. So a lone Cyberman is either operating on his own intelligence or borrowing processing power from him inactive comrades, allowing it to act intelligently and autonomously. When all the Cybermen wake up they gather into a single hive minded army.

And he's having a hard time trusting her, because she would have no way of knowing if she had seen them, and he doesn't know what they might have put in her head already. 

Maybe this is even the episode where Clara gets her first glimpse of just how scary the Doctor can be. He's running around, trying to juggle two monsters at once, no time to explain it all to her.

1367682644.0,187,self.gallifrey,1doke0,"Clara, the Doctor’s name, &amp; “Remember”",214,27,49,http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/1doke0/clara_the_doctors_name_remember/,"This post started as a thought on Clara’s reaction to the Doctor’s name and morphed into something completely different.

We have all observed the similarity of the Doctor’s and Clara’s mannerisms, intellect, cleverness, and strength of character.  In many ways she is a reflection of the Doctor.  The mirror is one of youth and optimism versus age and experience.

A good part of Series 6 was spent with the Doctor reflecting upon this past and what he had become.  One gets the impression that he is not too pleased with what he saw.  “A good man doesn’t need rules; you don’t want to find out why I have so many.”  Between Series 6 &amp; 7, he starts to erase himself from history.

Along comes Clara, as Oswin, a young women seeking adventure and trying to define herself.  Her strength of character resists the ~~Darlek~~ Dalek conversion.  Her optimism is the antithesis of ~~Darlek~~ Dalek definition of hate being beautiful; so much so that they put her in the center of the asylum, chained alone in a room.  Next he meets Clara Oswin Oswald, who is both bar maid and governess, going against the class system of Victorian English.  Now he is with Clara Oswald, who made it quite clear to him that it is without the “Oswin”, she doesn’t want to be a ghost of the others.  In all three incarnations she refuses to allow others (society) to define her.  As her character developed we see that she doesn’t walk away from those in need of help.  In many ways she is as the doctor was when he set out on his adventure with the TARDIS.

Series 7B has been about the contrast of Clara’s youth and optimism versus the Doctor’s burden of age, expression and self-judgment.  An obvious illustration of this is when they stood before Grandfather in tRoA, the Doctor presented memories of his past and Clara presented hope and wishes for the future.

So what does the Doctor’s name have to do with this?  When Clara discovered the Doctor’s name, her casual reaction leads me to believe that there was no significant about it, at least to Clara, other than simply he has a name.  To Clara, a person’s name is their identity, so later when she questions him about it; it’s not about what it is but rather why he doesn’t use it; why is he running away from himself.

Clara’s purpose is to remind the Doctor of whom he is, what his core values are.  While he has done many unpleasant deeds; they had been done to defend of others.  When Clara says “Remember”, it is not to remember her but rather his true self.  So when he goes to the Fields of Trenzalore, he can answer the question based on the values of his soul and not what others’ opinions are of him.

TLDR: Clara is telling the Doctor to “Remember” his true self and not her.

Edit: Sorry about the Darlek/Dalek thing.  I actually looked to another post to check the spelling.  Obviously I picked the wrong one.

I'm really, very sorry"".

When I first saw the episode, I thought she was sorry to break the rules about the spoilers, and I thought he was shocked to find out he trusted her to much in the future.

Now I think this was much darker foreshadowing. She's sorry because of the implications of her knowing his name. She could only know his name for one reason, and it's not because they're married. It's because something terrible has happened. His face isn't a face of shock, but of terror. She's sorry because now he must live with the impending future. He has to live knowing that something terrible awaits him.

We thought River knew his name after their marriage ceremony, but we have no proof of that. He also said there was only one time he could tell someone his name. This is interesting as we know someone could also know his name from reading the History of the Time War, as Clara did - I'm not sure how to reconcile that. Since River is in this season's finale, the Name of the Doctor, I think she learns it there.

However, as he has yet to take her on their last date (as we are seeing her in the finale), and he is not only Eleven when he does that but also must be without a companion as she is confused when she thinks another women is present, River must be around for a bit longer, at least through the resolution of whatever terrible event occurs following the Name of the Doctor. He clearly wouldn't be taking her on a date if he had just unleashed the fury of the Time Lords on the universe, and River wouldn't be taking a team to the Library is he needed her help. This also indicates he certainly doesn't regenerate in the finale or the 50th. However, as Alex Kingston mentioned a spin-off in a recent interview, she can't be around much longer. I'd give her next season as her last.

Anyways, if Moffat has been building an arch since Silence in the Library, it's pretty obvious that something terrible is attached to his name. Many think it's the key to the Time Lock, but I don't think so. As I mentioned in a previous post, I think it reveals a terrible past, and that's why he looks so scared when he hears his name.

We all love the show so much that we spend a good chunk of our time talking about it on the internet! And this is a great thing. There's nothing like sitting back and reading all of your guys' great fan theories and taking part in in-depth character discussions.  
Of course, each of us also have pretty strong opinions about what we *don't* like about the show. This can be insightful as well, and all fan bases should argue over which characters, show runners, and story lines, are best and worst.  
The problem that I have been seeing lately is that many of us are starting to be a little over critical of this show that we all supposedly love. ""This line was unnecessary"", ""I don't like this catch phrase"", ""That doesn't fit with continuity from the classics"", etc etc. Don't get me wrong, talking about the problems with episodes is important and even necessary in some cases, but when I come to a web forum dedicated to something I love, I don't want to be overwhelmed with comments complaining about it.  
Yes, *The Power of Three* had a weak ending. Oh well, the episode's focus was character development anyways. OK, *Dinosaurs on a Spaceship* might have had too many supporting characters that didn't have enough time to fully grow. And sure, the Statue of Liberty angel in *The Angels take Manhattan* was a little cheesy. But overall? This has been one of the best acted, most entertaining, high budget, seasons of Doctor Who *ever*. And I think that a lot of us forget, that it really is a family show in the end. Sometimes sacrificing a little bit of continuity for an easier to understand storyline is beneficial.  
We have to remember our roots. What originally made us fall in love with the show? A lot of us started with Classic Who, and I think that all of us would agree that the classics are amazing. Yet they are far from perfect. Bubblewrap monsters, botched lines, and The Kandyman? Continuity in the classics is also all over the place. But I wouldn't want to change even a frame of it. 
What I'm trying to say in this late night wall of text, is that Doctor Who is about having fun and being free! So let's all have a little more fun with it, and appreciate it the show for what it is.  

  
Sorry, one more thing. I think what really gets at me most is the continuity thing. The show is about mother flipping time travel and it's been going on for almost 50 years! There is bound to be some mistakes in the continuity. I think that the best thing to do is just come to terms with the fact that we aren't time lords and that we can't understand the laws of the time vortex.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Doctor who may be the oldest question but it is well documented that some plot lines recently have been left hanging by the showrunners and writers (whom I shall henceforth collectively refer to as Moffat) just when we are promised more
answers. Some of these threads span several series (looking at you River) and have/are about to hopefully maybe converge(d) in the finale and 50th. I have attempted
to gather together all of the questions to get a clear idea of what is unknown to us the audience, consequently my brain hurts. There are likely many missing so please
suggest any. Also, some of these questions do have answers that I might have overlooked or at least somewhat supported hypotheses whereas others are obviously ongoing plot points. As such the
first on the list is the question on everyone's mind:


1a) **Who is HurtDoc?** There are many, many speculations on this and it seems each has evidence for and against. Presumably we cannot deduce it yet and will likely be
revealed to us in the 50th as it is an active plot point.

1b) **Why is he not allowed The Name of The Doctor?** Same as 1a.

1c) **Why is he wearing these clothes in [this image](http://www.kasterborous.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/dw-50th-location-johnhurt.jpg) from the set?** They are frustratingly similar to a combo of 8th/9th Doctor dress. Similar but not identical. Comparison pics: [8th](http://mattcbr.files.wordpress.com/2008/04/paul_mcgann_2.jpg) [9th](http://i91.photobucket.com/albums/k312/unopoo_2006/Blog/BIFXOtoCEAAHP1d.jpg). Perhaps this is a little bit of misdirection? Time will tell.

1d) **Why didn't Clara see him when she went into Doc's timeline?** Same as 1a and b as this will depend greatly on who he is. Is it because he is time locked? Is he a
future incarnation? Or even a pre-Hartnell, pre-Doctor incarnation? 

2) **Why didn't Clara meet any future incarnations?** I think the idea is that the GI only attacked Doctor up until current 11th to kill him at that point. Could do with clarification on this. Perhaps we will find out in the 50th since we did not see them leave the time stream.

3) **The Doctor DID fail to answer on the fields of Trenzalore. Does the prophecy remain unfulfilled? Was it wrong? Is it just Moffat being tricky?** This question is tied to what exactly the prophecy means.

4a) **How do they know all this stuff?** How did the Silence know about the prophecy and/or what they fear(ed) the Doc would/will do? How does the GI know so much about 
the Doc's future, his future nicknames and his grave site? How does the Doc know who HurtDoc is?

4b) **Who even IS the Great Intelligence?** This remains unanswered in the purely television universe AFAIK and is likely to remain a subject for external exploration.

5a) **Where have the Silence gone?** Were they bad guys? Has the event they were attempting to avoid come to pass?

5b) **Is Jenny made to forget to lock the door by a Silent?** (From [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/1eonvl/spoilers_season_7_little_things_big_reveals/) by /u/silvarus) At this point in Earth's timeline the Moon landing has
not happened so the Silents would still be manipulating the humans.

6a) **Silence will fall?** We heard it from Prisoner Zero, in the prophecy, said the voice in the TARDIS as it explodes and is heavily connected to the Silence. Which silence does it refer to?

6b) **Why did the TARDIS explode in series 5?** Is that John Hurt's voice declaring silence will fall? I am thoroughly convinced it is. How would that connect with anything else known about HurtDoc? This mystery is the most annoying as it is the biggest one left unsolved for multiple series. The half-answer the Silence did it is not very satisfactory.

8a) **What are the spoilers River mentions just before she goes in The Name Of The Doctor?** Is there genuinely more to be learned about/from her or was she just pointing out Clara wasn't dead? Probably.

8b) **Why does River expect 10 to recognise her in the library if that is the only time she sees 10?** Why does she only realise he is very young from his eyes, wouldn't
his face be a dead give away?

8c) **What did the Doctor whisper to River in Let's Kill Hitler?** Presumably his name knowing that she will need it in the future and that he is about to die.

8d) **When was the last time the Doctor and River met, from the Doctor's point of view?** credit to /u/molempole for suggesting this one. [Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/1ep208/spoilers_finale_50th_doctor_who_or_the_ongoing/ca2f6lh).

9) **Is that a beetle or a tree?** (From [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/1eonvl/spoilers_season_7_little_things_big_reveals/) by /u/silvarus) It's probably a tree though...

10) **What actually happens at Trenzalore, what is the battle?** We cannot currently know the answer to this question and possibly never will, which is fine, not many people
will want to know how the Doctor dies.

11) **How aware of what's going on are the scattered Claras and GIs?** Clara says as she's falling that the only things she knows is that she must save the Doctor, presumably 
this is shared by all her splintered copies.

12a) **Who is the woman in the shop that gives Clara the phone number for the TARDIS?** I suspect Rose or possibly somehow another Clara.

12b) **Why does ""Run you clever boy and remember"" appear as Clara's wifi password if it is, presumably scattered by her afterwards?** Clara asks Angie for the wifi
password and then asks how she is supposed to remember rycbar123, the camera cuts away so we don't see it but it's possible Angie suggests the nmemonic.

13) **Is [Amy's book](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Summer_Falls) supposed to be about Clara and does it hold any clues to the story?** It is likely irrelevant with a few parallels for fun.

14) **How does Strax continue to be so hilarious?** Seriously, I love that guy.


15) **Doctor who?** Our attention is drawn to this question in Silence in the Library when we discover River knows his name. Since then it has been a plot point of growing importance which has, as is typical or Moffat, been nimbly dodged just as we were seeing an answer on the horizon. Even more so than the mystery of Trenzalore most people will not want to know the Doctor's name, including, I would suggest, Moffat. We will never know, and that is good.

16) **What did the Doctor do during his seeming 200 years of travelling without Amy and Rory?** credit to /u/Meloku for suggesting this one. [Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/1ep208/spoilers_finale_50th_doctor_who_or_the_ongoing/ca2fnf0).

So, what do you think? How are these connected? What else is unknown? Which questions can be dismissed? Please point out if any questions have already been answered.

&gt;***""On the fields of Trenzalore, at the fall of the eleventh, 
when no living creature can speak falsely or fail to answer, 
a Question will be asked, a question that must never, ever be answered.***  
  
&gt;***SILENCE WILL (MUST) FALL WHEN THE QUESTION IS ASKED.""***
  
...

We now know what all of that means.  Let's parse this:

&gt;**On the fields of Trenzalore, at the fall of the eleventh,**

At the battlefield on Trenzalore, the future final resting place of the Doctor, the 11th Doctor will be outwitted (and indeed *fall*, leading to the unveiling of his darkest secret),

&gt;**when no living creature can speak falsely or fail to answer,**

and when *death is threatened as penalty* for speaking falsely or failing to answer, 

&gt;**a Question will be asked, a question that must never, ever be answered.**

the Doctor will have no choice but to reveal his name, which opens his Tomb, providing unfettered access to his entire timeline, *a power which could pervert or destroy the Universe.*

&gt;**SILENCE WILL (MUST) FALL WHEN THE QUESTION IS ASKED.**

The one who knows the answer *must not answer because the Universe could be destroyed* should anyone know this password and gain access!  

But - fortunately or unfortunately - ***River Song, who is herself ""no living creature,""*** is there to speak the answer, and because nobody can hear her, the *Question is indeed answered with* ***silence***.
  
  
...  
The whole mystery of the Silence is now unraveled.  The whole time, the Silence were trying to prevent the Doctor from arriving at his Tomb, because they knew there was a weak point in the continuum there that in the wrong hands could undo all of creation.  They may have even known about the existence of the Dark Doctor and feared his being unleashed.  
  
In their attempts to safeguard the whole history of the universe, they tried to not only alter the future and prevent that final battle from happening but also to prevent the Doctor from arriving at that dangerous place in his own future.  First, they trapped him in the Pandorica and attempted to destroy his TARDIS, in their ineptitude nearly causing the end of the Universe themselves.  Next, they arranged to have him killed in such a way that his death was a fixed point on Earth, unable to be undone, perhaps believing that creating a new fixed point would overwrite the fixed point of his future death on Trenzalore.  This also failed, and in the process the Silence were dealt a heavy blow and could do no more to stop the inevitable from happening.  
 
Then a force beyond the Silence's reckoning, the Great Intelligence, sought revenge on the Doctor, learned of his Tomb and the power contained within, and conspired to lead him there and force him to open it.  But, as usual, the villain failed to account for the power of the Doctor's greatest defense: the loyalty of his companions.  Clara went in after the Great Intelligence and thwarted him, inspiring the Doctor to do the impossible and follow her in turn, and together they quashed the G.I.'s ambitions.  
  
But the Doctor's incursion into his own timestream had consequences: his darkest secret and his greatest shame was unveiled and unleashed on the universe - himself, at his worst, the version of himself who turned away from the Name of the Doctor.  

[^^^^^\*](http://thedoctorwhopodcast.com/forum/index.php?topic=2359.msg23143#msg23143 ""originally posted by me on the DWP forums"")
  
EDIT: More!  The original prophecy was only that Silence Must Fall When the Question is Asked.  Dorium's longer clarification of it came much later.  It would make sense that the cult of the Silence arose shortly after the Doctor's death and entombment.  Somebody must have realized that there was a great and terrible power behind the doors of that Tomb, and that those who wished to exploit that power would stop at nothing to seek out those who knew the keyword.  The prophecy was an admonition to anyone who was asked that question.  
  
The later clarification came when the Silence realized what the question actually was - the oldest question, asked by the people of the Universe in response distress call came out requesting help for the Doctor (see ""The Wedding of River Song""): Doctor who?  Thus their old warning, borne out of guardianship, gained eschatological, religious overtones, for the more they learned of the Doctor, the more they feared his Tomb.  Finally, word of what happened in ""The Name of the Doctor"" reached them, and the prophecy was crystallized into a record of the events there, encoded in ambiguous wording (perhaps the original was lost in translation over time), and preserved by the Silence.",S7E14 (Finale),False,,t5_2tf29,1369147431.0,a,,True,t3_1epcpe,http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/1epcpe/the_silence_prophecy_explained_finale_spoilers/,

Now I'm not here to say for people to grow up because the show is about changing themes because we have enough of that already. I'm here to ask who legitimately enjoys all three factions. I mean theres always good episodes and bad episodes, good arcs and bad arcs, and everyone has a favorite Doctor, but I enjoy them all.

I've watched most of all the legally available episodes. and all of the New Who, and I can't say I appreciate any more than another to the point of hating others. Eleven is my favorite, and I love Moffat's era. Sure there are some inconsistensies and ponts that I don't like, but That doesn't mean I don't appreciate his era. I love RTD's time as well. There were a few episodes that were a bit too childish (The Slitheen being a a bit too silly alien) but I feel like he directed 9 and 10 in the right direction. 

Everyone has to remember that with a Doctors tendencies, amnnerisms, and base of self, is the writers. The actor will take what the writers give him, and give life and extend on their work.

1375155693.0,167,self.gallifrey,1jbqpd,"Why the Valeyard has already returned in New Who - not the Valeyard as a specific character, but rather the concept that he embodied. [SPOILERS]",192,25,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/1jbqpd/why_the_valeyard_has_already_returned_in_new_who/,"I saw a post the other day where a user made a statement similar to ""THE VALEYARD ISN'T COMING BACK GET OVER IT"". I'd like to argue that isn't true, and in fact, the concept has already been brought back.

We don't need the incarnation/amalgamation/dude with the funny robes known as the Valeyard to return to bring in the concept of the Valeyard. The concept is simple: there is a darkness inside the Doctor, and he is in conflict with it. In Trial of a Time Lord, this concept manifested in the Valeyard, who came to put him on trial and steal his lives.

Since the reboot, we saw a clear return of the concept represent by the Valeyard in the Dream Lord. Here, a dark part of the Doctor came out and again tried to destroy him. While this dealt with Amy more than the Valeyard dealt with Six's companions, there was a clear conflict between the Doctor and the Dream Lord. After considering that the Dream Lord was part of the Doctor's psyche, you can really see their dialogue as an internal conflict, illustrating the deep seated self loathing we often see in the Eleventh Doctor - the Dream Lord even insults his choice of dress.

It hasn't stopped there though. In Nightmare in Silver, the Valeyard concept was again referenced and fleshed out. Nightmare in Silver was the Sixth Doctor tribute episode, and the dialogue between the Cyber Planner and the Doctor was very reminiscent of Trial of the Time Lord. Here we see the dark part of him manifest again, and while we usually see the Doctor arguing with some physical manifestation of himself, here we get to see it all in one body. I actually prefer this exploration of his inner conflict and darkness to the Valeyard and the Dream Lord, but that might because Matt Smith's acting was so wonderful.

However, the Name of the Doctor really topped it off. Not only is there a reference to the Valeyard and the other names the Doctor goes by in darker times, but we get a solid acknowledgement to follow it up with the quote ""he's me, but he's not the Doctor"" - when the darker side of the Doctor comes out, the Doctor tries to dissociate them from himself. At the end of the episode we see what we can only presume is a darker Doctor, who like the Valeyard and the Dream Lord will not go by the name of the Doctor. This inner conflict, likely dealing with his shame and self-loathing due to his past actions, would appear to be central to the 50th anniversary special.

So no, the Valeyard has in fact already returned. The Valeyard is a concept - the Doctor, a man with many personalities and many faces, has a dark side. This dark side creates internal conflict, and characters such as the Valeyard, the Dream Lord, the Cyber Planner, and this new mysterious Doctor act as the manifestation of this conflict so that the writers can explore it and present it to the viewers. 

I couldn't care less if the man in the black robes returns to New Who - I'm happy with how they've explored the concept of the Doctor's internal conflict so far and seem to plan to continue to explore it in the coming special.",DISCUSSION,False,,t5_2tf29,False,h,,True,t3_1jbqpd,http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/1jbqpd/why_the_valeyard_has_already_returned_in_new_who/,

I think he knew that saying it would have left her unhealable, unable to accept the only happiness he was able to offer her, and that he chose to hurt her a little more in order to complete his abandonment and make it easier on her. 

Protective 'til the bitter end, the Doctor does his best to keep Rose from seeing the extent of his pain. But she's not looking at him when Ten II whispers in her ear, and she doesn't see the way he closes his eyes and swallows when the other Doctor says what he's wanted to for so long.

I just want to point out why his name matters and what it could add to the show.

Right now, the Doctor has a name. His name is the Doctor. Using this name, you can learn a lot about him, as there is a huge body of history mentioning him and his role in the major events. Think about when he says ""Look me up"" in Forest of the Dead. 

If he has another name but wishes it to be secret, it's reasonable to assume that he wants to hide the history associated with that name. When the Doctor went by his true name, he must have gathered a history which he is not proud of, and thus by going by his new name, the Doctor, he effectively disconnects himself from that past.

It's a little unclear if he has always gone by the name the Doctor while adventuring. If he did pick the name when he was young (as has been stated by the Master), it wouldn't seem like he had much of a history. Yet, in Silver Nemesis, the Seventh Doctor is threatened by Lady Peinforte, who indicates she knows the answer to the question ""Doctor who?"" and has information about his past. This may indicate we are going to learn about a past life - the best way to work this into the current show would be through the Other, but that will probably be messy, so I'm not sure they would do that.

No matter what his name is, when we learn his name in the finale, we are sure to learn something about his past, something he hides. This will add a brand new layer of complexity and darkness to the show, and I think it will definitely change the show forever, like Moffat said.

What I take away from this scene:

1. He has a name. A real, proper, English name.

2. The name reveals a real story, a familiar one. A real proper historical story where he is the main figure.

What I infer from the exchange is that his name is something of historical or social significance that is familiar to Clara, and by extension all humanity. At the sight of it she *realises* who he ""really"" is: a great thinker like Einstein, Bohr, or Aristotle; an influential cultural figure such as Jesus. Or Adam. Or Beelzebub. Most likely in my mind is someone relevant from the 50s or 60s, to tie in with the Hartnell period when Susan was being schooled, and some early mistake made by an inexperienced Time Lord on-the-run.

Watch Clara's face as she moves from ""I'm so clever - I worked out who he really is - and I got him to confirm it"" to ""oh my goodness, he's &lt;so-and-so&gt;”

In the spirit of mis-direction it is also entirely possible to my mind that the name is relevant only to Clara, perhaps a long lost ancestor. But I don't really think so. I think his name has become pervasive in human history which is why their exchange is a jumble of cut off sentences and mutual understanding. 

It also offers a solution to the ""what name could possibly not be a let down"". We are being offered a backstory with the promise of a further mystery.

He is, in general, blamed for the shortcomings of any episode, regardless of who was the individual writer. It is understood that he plots the major story arcs of the episodes and generally oversees the individual scripts, adding in arc-centric elements and checking for continuity, but it seems that his role beyond that is grossly overstated in /r/gallifrey, to my understanding. 

About 2 years ago, a short time after ""The Doctor's Wife"" aired, Neil Gaiman [wrote a blog](http://journal.neilgaiman.com/2011/06/fairly-humongous-doctor-who-q-mostly.html) regarding the writing process for a Doctor Who episode. I'm sure it's been posted here before, but I feel it's important to consider again, in regards to the general negative attitude towards Moffat within this subreddit. 

I understand that a lot of the problems people have with Moffat stem from his involvement in the general overarching story arcs of each season. This is a criticism that can be considered valid, but is also clearly a matter of opinion rather than ineptitude on Moffat's part. What troubles me is the trend blaming Moffat for every shortcoming in every lackluster episode, something which I believe to be unjust. For example, many had problems with ""The Curse of the Black Spot"", and most of those problems are placed on Moffat's shoulders rather than the man who wrote the episode, Stephen Thompson. While Moffat was certainly involved in a general sense with the episode, it's safe to say (at least judging by Gaiman's blog) that few, if any, of the major plot point ideas in the episode were Moffat's. Still, the cop-out of an ending is often used to demonstrate ""Moffat's contrived deus ex machina plotting style"" and an example of how he's ""ruined Who with non-endings and paradoxes."" 

I must admit, I'm a bit hesitant to post this. I'm a Moffat fan, and am often bothered by the poor attitudes towards him. While he certainly has shortcomings, I think he is the victim of a lot more blame than he deserves. I of course could be totally wrong, and in the end it really is just a matter of opinion. I simply intend to point out something which I think a lot of /r/gallifrey members miss, and spark a healthy and civilized debate. I look forward to seeing your opinions.

Rose became  Bad Wolf. Donna was the most important person in the universe. Amy could remember things erased from time. Clara was scattered throughout time.

Before you get upset about this, ask yourself this: Why would the Doctor have companions that AREN'T special?

Since the reboot, we've come to realize that the TARDIS has more than a  bit of control over the Doctor's travels. The TARDIS can see all of time - she knows where and when the Doctor needs to be, and at what point in his own personal time line he should be there. 

If this is so, the TARDIS is essentially picking the companions - he only meets them because the TARDIS brings him to them. Why would the TARDIS pick any given companion? It picks the companion the Doctor needs. Every companion plays a crucial role in saving the Doctor (or saving the day) at some point, and the TARDIS knows this.

The TARDIS needed to make sure each companion gets onboard, because once they were onboard, they are on their way to fulfilling their destinies.  The TARDIS knew that if Nine found Rose,  she would become the Bad Wolf and defeat the Daleks. The TARDIS knew that if Ten met Donna, she would become the Doctor-Donna and create the Meta-Ten, defeating the Daleks again. The TARDIS knew that there was a single person in the universe who could remember things erased from time, and that the Doctor would need to be remembered.

As the Doctor messes with time more and more, he requires more and more help to get out of trouble. The TARDIS is providing that help, using its knowledge of all time to create the most spectacular companions she can. The TARDIS doesn't just bring him where he needs to be - she brings him to who he needs to be with.

This is why I'm fine with ""special"" companions. For the most part, they aren't special, their adventures make them special. In other cases, they're exactly who the Doctor needs, and I think the Doctor deserves a little help.",DISCUSSION,False,,t5_2tf29,False,h,,True,t3_1h5pn5,http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/1h5pn5/there_seems_to_be_a_general_dislike_of_the_recent/,

Each episode has had a way of getting around the fact that for The Angels to be a threat, The Doctor can't use his TARDIS.

Doctors. (x-post from r/doctorwho)",168,22,70,http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/12nyez/ive_just_completed_all_of_doctor_who_from_the_1st/,"Someone suggested I x/post here. :)

Well it's been a long and awesome trip but it's over. Oh, how I wish it wasn't. The first episode I saw was ""The Lodger"" with the 11th Doctor about a year ago and from there I became intrigued. I decided if I was going to get into the show, I would do it to the fullest. From that episode I went back to 9 and proceeded to watch through to 11 which didn't take too long. After some thinking and really getting interested, I decided to start from the beginning. I obtained all of the episodes and started my quest. I have to say it was great. It took about a good 3 or 4 months to get through them all. Thats watching a few serials every day. I realized that I dont have a favorite Doctor. They all have their amazing points. I figured I'd list them. Obviously this is all my opinion, and I would love to discuss. 

1st Doctor - I like him because, to me, he was the most stern and stubborn. He was the typical ""grumpy old man."" Always had to have his way and didn't take any crap from anyone. I admit Susan got a little tiring after a while but Ian and Barbara were a good combo. 

2nd Doctor - He was the one who always seemed like he was afraid of things. Always running around and overreacting, but he was very intellectual and always, no matter how scared he acted, came through. I would say companion wise, Jaime and Zoe were the best. 

3rd Doctor - He was the badass. He was smart, sarcastic, and could kick some ass. It was good to see some fight in the Doctor, especially after the 2nd Doctor seemed to be the complete opposite. Sarah Jane was obviously one of the better companions to the 3rd but I would have like to see more of Liz Shaw. 

4th Doctor - He was the nut. Crazy, goofy and funny. All over the place but always knowing what's going on. He had a mean streak and was a bit of a tough guy. I'd say K-9 and Romana I were my favorite companions here. 

5th Doctor - He struck me as the smooth, playboy type. Very sophisticated, kept things lively. Confident and sometimes cocky which was awesome. Companions for this one is hard. I didn't like most of them I have to say. Nyssa wan't bad. Teegan and Adric, I could not stand. Peri was pretty cool but she flowed over more into the 6th. 

6th Doctor - He was the loud mouthed one. Very cocky, always had to be right, very obnoxious sometimes. ""Trial of a Time Lord"" was the best. It all came together quite well. Peri would be the better choice for companion here. Mel was a little too obnoxious for my taste. 

7th Doctor - He didnt seem to have one trait more than the other. He was a good mix of the previous Doctors. It was good to see him go from quirky in the beginning to a bit serious toward the end. I'd have to say I'll go with Ace on this one, as Mel would be the only other choice. 

8th Doctor - Today is when I watched the movie. I have to say, I would have definitely liked to see more of the 8th Doctor. I liked his personality. He seemed like a very gentle incarnation. Would have been great to see him continue. 

9th Doctor - I feel Eccleston did a great job. I liked his anger and I liked his goofyness. He was always all smiles but don't piss him off. I'd have to say I liked Rose better as 9's companion then 10's. 

10th Doctor - Here is where the real passion of the Doctor comes out. The happiness, the anger, the cleverness. He was a great culmination of the previous Doctors. He was a baddass like 3, goofy like 4, smooth like 5 and sometimes obnoxious like 6. He seemed to have the most heart. For companions I will have to say Martha Jones and Captain Jack, if you count him. Donna was great as well. 

11th Doctor - Now we come to the present Doctor. He has the goofyness factor. He seems more like a kid which is great. He also can switch to very passionate and angry. The obvious companion choice would be Amy and Rory, but I think they ran a litte too long. I love River. Rory, after the whole Centurion thing, was awesome. 

Well, there is my breakdown of my experience with the 11 Doctors. THe stories were great, adventures were awesome. The continuity was great as well. It was interesting seeing the use of special effects back that far. Seeing the evolution of the Daleks and the Cybermen was fantastic. The Master really made things good. Seeing the Time Lords and Gallifrey was just superb. Now that I'm done, it's almost like I don't know what to do with myself. Now, I suppose, it's just waiting for the new episodes to keep coming. I will probably go back to some of my favorite serials from the old Doctors. I'm glad to have gotten through them. I didnt think it would be as interesting as it was. I was sure proved wrong. Having seen them all, I feel like a true Whovian. I know I didn't grow up in that era but I have nothing but respect for it and enjoyed every bit of it.

Since there would also be no cracks, there would likely be no Amy and Rory, because it would appear that the TARDIS brought the Eleventh Doctor to Amy because of the cracks (something to do with Amy's prayer to Santa Claus and her time-awareness, I assume). 

As you can see, it's all Jamie's fault. I'd love to see the Eleventh Doctor meet Jamie and bring it up. I can imagine their conversation:

The last time the show had a historical was 1982's ""Black Orchid"", and the last time before that was ""The Highlanders"" 15 years earlier. They used to be a staple of the program, back when the show was meant to be somewhat educational, but now, no longer feature.

I feel like a pure historical would be a nice change of pace for the show. Every single episode of new who has had some form of sci-fi based monster or villain, and these tropes become a bit stale. I'd love for the show to dispense with the need for a monster and do something a little bit unconventional. (It should be noted that ""Historical"" is a misnomer, as the story could be written in the present or even the near future).

I feel as if some episodes of new who would have been so much better if written as strict historicals, ""Vincent and the Doctor"" being the most prevalent example. Despite the fact that the monster is dispensed of early within the story, it still comes across shoe-horned and unnecessary. I feel as if that particular episode would function much better solely as story about depression and mental illness, focusing on Van-Gogh, and at times it seems like it was written this way.

Another episode that could have benefited from being a pure historical is season four's ""The Unicorn and the Wasp"". Unlike ""Vincent and the Doctor"" it was probably written as the standard monster-affair that it is, but I feel that a standard murder mystery involving Agatha Christie and the Doctor would have been much more enjoyable than the mess of the episode we got when the monster was crammed in (although it might have been a little too reminiscent of ""Black Orchid"" in that respect.).

But, in the modern era of Who, would a historical ever make it past pre-production stages? Would these episodes still have appeal, both to the fans of the show and the casual viewer? Or has Doctor Who become so wide-known as the show with the unsettling monsters, that an episode featuring only humans and human problems would simply deviate too much from the shows format?",,False,,t5_2tf29,False,,,True,t3_176q5z,http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/176q5z/is_there_still_room_for_a_pure_historical_in/,

All the theories I've read so far about John Hurt's Doctor assume that he did something monstrous and devastating- ending the Time War, becoming the Valeyard, that sort of thing. And Hurt's grizzled and war-weary appearance and the way he and Matt delivered their lines in that scene seem to be strongly hinting that way.

But what if, instead of going too far, Hurt's Doctor didn't go far enough? And what if the peace and sanity he was protecting were *his own*?

Suppose Hurt's Doctor (wherever he falls in the timeline) is an incarnation that stopped running. He's no longer the Madman with a Box. It's not just that he's in exile, or in hiding, or moping around in a cloud for a while- it's that he's essentially taken an entire lifetime off from being the Doctor.  He settled down. Got respectable. Maybe he was raising a family, and that's what all the references over the past couple seasons have been leading up to. Maybe he was occupied with some fruitless, impossible project- founding New Gallifrey, perhaps, or trying to attain godhood without destroying the universe like Rassilon would have.  Maybe he was just too scared or traumatized or exhausted to go on.

But whatever the reason, Hurt's Doctor wasn't willing to intervene in the wider universe. He saw the the sort of tyranny and tragedy and injustice that his other incarnations fought against, and he did... nothing.  He forced himself to look the other way. He refused to help. In short, he failed to do what the Doctor *does*.

Perhaps the special will be the story of his chance at some form of atonement- not for what he has done, but for what he hasn't.",SPOILER,False,,t5_2tf29,False,g,,True,t3_1eqdbg,http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/1eqdbg/finale_and_anniversary_spoilers_could_hurts/,

    Dalek 1: The Dalek Stratagem nears completion. The fleet is almost ready. You will not intervene.
    The Doctor: Oh, really? And why's that?
    Dalek 1: [glances at Rose] We have your associate. You will obey or she will be exterminated!
    The Doctor: No.
    [Pause. The Daleks glance at each other in confusion.]
    Dalek 1: Explain yourself.
    The Doctor: I said no.
    Dalek 1: What is the meaning of this negative?
    The Doctor: It means no.
    Dalek 1: But she will be destroyed!
    The Doctor: No! 'Cause this is what I'm gonna do: I'm gonna rescue her! I'm gonna save Rose Tyler from the middle of the Dalek fleet! And then I'm gonna save the Earth! And then, just to finish off, I'm gonna wipe every last stinking Dalek out of the sky!

    The Doctor: Yeah! And doesn't that scare you to death? Rose?
    Rose: Yes, Doctor?

This exchange alone shows The Doctor has some major badassery potential (we obviously know this now) and just makes me go ""F**k Yeah Doctor!""

It certainly wasn't said in-episode to cover some stupid plot hole or continuity issue. It's to assert that the Doctor uses deception to further his goals (i.e., lying about dying in the Big Bang). If anything, it furthers the plot because it doesn't stop at *lying*--there's always *a reason why* the Doctor lied.

So please, just please, stop using it as a lame excuse for shitty continuity or gaping plot holes.

Speaking of which, I don't know why people are so afraid of continuity, as if that is sacrilegious to the essence of DW. Sure, DW might be about change, but that doesn't make it an excuse for writers and showrunners to just continually neglect being consistent. That's just poor storytelling/showrunning.

Personally, I don't care if continuity or canon breaks across different Doctors or different showrunners (as long as it isn't too drastic). What irks me is if there's a certain rule/event introduced in a certain era (same Doctor or showrunner) and is broken in that same era. Especially if it's done poorly, as it reeks of lazy writing.

This is one of the reasons why I think that while Moffat is a top-notch episode writer, he is quite a terrible showrunner. Just look at all the Angel rules he had to break, and all those sketchy and convenient fixed points and silly paradoxes. I feel the same way with JN-T (though his run had been a hell of a roller coaster), who couldn't even keep the Doctor's characteristics consistent within a single incarnation--the character change under JNT isn't a development, it's just because of him being wishy-washy with the direction the show's going to take.",,False,,t5_2tf29,False,,,True,t3_19j9gj,http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/19j9gj/can_we_please_stop_using_the_doctor_lies_as_a/,

*I made this, first and foremost, to spark some discussion. I'm basically just throwing up talking points in this subject and seeing what sticks. If there's anything I missed or an alternate interpretation that you think holds more merit than what I've got here please speak up in the comments, because that's what I've written all this incessant rambling for.*
___

***RTD and Religion***
___

When Russel T. Davies took the reins of Doctor Who, perhaps the most interesting work under his belt was the controversial television serial [**Second Coming**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Second_Coming_\(TV_serial\)), the story of a man who realizes that he is the son of God and seeks a third testament for humanity to attempt to avert the Apocalypse (perhaps not-so-incidentally, this is where RTD met Christopher Eccleston). 

The story ends with Eccleston, the son of God, realizing that this ""Third Testament"" is the end of all religion. The death of God and heaven and hell and all supernatural forces in existence. Believing humanity to need the stark reality of no afterlife or divinity to start taking responsibility for themselves and behaving properly. It's left ambiguous to whether or not this was the right choice to make.

With all this in mind, it's key to note that while Russel T. Davies is a confirmed atheist, he created *Second Coming* not to send any particular message, but merely to ""get people thinking about religion"" and create controversial television.

___

***The Doctor as a Religious Figure***
___

And in many respects, he does this with Doctor Who. With the Doctor becoming ""The Last of the Time Lords"" at the start of Russel's run, and a history that spans the universe several times over, RTD chose to take the Doctor into a decidedly new direction: that of the ""Lonely Wandering God"" with a healthy dash of messianic themes.

It really doesn't take a serious amount of investigation to find these themes. Frequently the Jesus-like element of the Doctor is played up to near-outlandish levels, perhaps none more overt than the infamous climax of **The Last of the Time Lords** where the diabolical Master scoffs:

&gt; MASTER: Nothing will happen. Is that your weapon? Prayer? 

Followed by the Doctor's (frankly hamfisted) reveal of what the Master is horrified that the Doctor is going to say:

&gt; DOCTOR: I forgive you. 

This has pretty well defined RTD's Doctor, Ten specifically. Frequently the Doctor sets himself to be a legend or figure of evil-smiting power and aid to the helpless (**Forest of the Dead**, **The Last of the Time Lords**) or a figure of peace that lays the foundation for proper society (**The Doctor's Daughter**) or the one who must make the ultimate sacrifices for mankind (**Parting of the Ways**, **Evolution of the Daleks**, **The End of Time, Part II**). 

The opening scene in **The End of Time: Part I** that depicts the TARDIS in stained glass and harkens to the Doctor as a ""sainted physician"" really underscores how RTD's Doctor is defined as having a peculiarly religious quality.

___
**Episode-by-Episode: What's the Doctor's Stance?**
___

While RTD's run may draw from religious themes and tropes, this does not necessarily mean that his interpretation of Doctor Who is strictly pro-religion. 

On the contrary: The Doctor, whose morality and decisions frequently spearhead the entire show (with occasional counterpoint from the companion), often conflicts with traditional religious values.

To give a proper run-down:

1. In **The Unquiet Dead** we have Dickens' rationalist mindset that seeks to explain away the inexplicable as trickery clashes with the sudden appearance of ""ghosts"". The Doctor explains in a relatively secular manner:  
&gt; DICKENS: Stop it. Can it be that I have the world entirely wrong?   
&gt; DOCTOR: Not wrong. There's just more to learn

   It's also important to note that this is the first episode where we see the Doctor rejecting religious beliefs in favor of pragmatism and helping the living:  
&gt; ROSE: But we can't [let the Gelth take bodies].  
DOCTOR: Why not?   
ROSE: It's not- I mean, it's not...   
DOCTOR: Not decent? Not polite? It could save their lives.  

1. In **Parting of the Ways** we see that the Daleks have developed a concept of blasphemy and an overall religious slant with the Dalek Emperor acting as their unholy idol.
&gt; DOCTOR: Since when did the Daleks have a concept of blasphemy?   
EMPEROR: I reached into the dirt and made new life. I am the God of all Daleks!   
DALEKS: Worship him. Worship him. Worship him.   
DOCTOR: They're insane.  
  
  Note how the Doctor reacts to the Daleks taking a religious slant, making the Emperor their god. He immediately remarks ""they're insane"". This could be taken as a slight against religion or just religious-based cults of personality, but it's more likely a reference to how utterly un-Dalek the concept is and how the Emperor is literally insane from the War.

2. In **Gridlock** we hear the radio apologetically broadcasting the ""daily contemplation"" of *""The Old Rugged Cross""* out to the trapped inhabitants of New New York's titanic freeway, acting as both an apology and opiate of false hope to those helplessly inching forward towards an empty goal.

3. **The Impossible Planet**/**The Satan Pit** we see a decidedly more religious plot, with the Doctor facing what is essentially Satan. The issue of whether the Doctor believes in any particular religion is skirted very carefully, resting the Doctor's incredulity on scientific matters (i.e. can things have existed from before the universe) rather than spiritual:
&gt; IDA: What about you? [Do you have a faith?]   
DOCTOR: I believe, I believe I haven't seen everything, I don't know. It's funny, isn't it? The things you make up. The rules. If that thing had said it came from beyond the universe, I'd believe it, but before the universe? Impossible. Doesn't fit my rule. Still, that's why I keep travelling. To be proved wrong. Thank you, Ida. 

4.  **Army of Ghosts** has the Doctor once again meeting the (apparent) supernatural. We also see his response to the concept of life-after-death as he's being chided by Jackie for acting so rationalistic all the time:  
&gt; JACKIE: You're always doing this. Reducing it to science. Why can't it be real? Just think of it, though. All the people we've lost. Our families coming back home. Don't you think it's beautiful?   
DOCTOR: I think it's horrific. 

5. In **The Fires of Pompeii** we have an order of prophets acting as servants to the Pyroviles. This is more normal psuedo-historical revisionism so I don't take it too much to heart, but it does portray a religion both as bad (the order of the seers) and benign (if not slightly mislead in the form of the ""house gods"").

And of course, throughout RTD's run the Doctor you have continuing pro-LGBT undertones, most notably in the Doctor's relationship with Jack.

One of the biggest times that the TARDIS directly reacted to an individual in a negative way was with Captain Jack, in Utopia. Ten comments that she ""flew all the way to the end of the universe just to get rid of you[Jack]"". That's because he was a fixed point in time, or as Ten so bluntly puts it, ""wrong"".

It's obvious at this point that in some aspect or another, Clara is also ""wrong"". She's someone who keeps dying and being resurrected in random points throughout time and space. This brings me to Cold War. The scene where the TARDIS flies away is probably the most disorienting part of the entire episode, and I've seen a lot of people comment on how it was tough to tell exactly what the hell happened. The facts are:

1. The TARDIS suddenly took off without warning. The Doctor then doesn't comment on why the hell that happened until the end of the episode, when he blames it on the HADS. He says ""never mind that"" to Clara when she asks. 

2. Clara is the one most severely affected by the TARDIS' departure. She gets knocked underwater *and* unconscious, where it appears that everyone else went on without a scratch. A heated argument amongst the other characters has both started and is in progress when she comes to.

Immediately upon Clara waking up, she asks what happened to the TARDIS. At this point, couldn't The Doctor have said ""defense mechanism""? The sub's crew is already extremely suspicious of their arrival, and I'm sure a ""never mind that"" in response to a magic blue box disappearing and shaking up the whole sub doesn't exactly put them at ease. ""Defense mechanism"" at least would've seemed like an *answer*, instead of a diversion of the whole subject. Granted, The Doctor is in the middle of a fight with the Captain at the time and wants to put his attention toward that, but in that case wouldn't putting him at ease be a pretty high priority?

By the end of the episode, the Doctor does say that it was the HADS that sent the TARDIS away. To be frank, I think he's wrong. How many episodes have we had where he has to say ""ignore everything I've already said"" multiple times? I think that the TARDIS was running from Clara. They were at the North Pole, and Sexy happened to rematerialize at the South Pole. The furthest possible point away from them on planet Earth. You could say that that was the joke, given the ""can we get a lift"" line, but that joke would've worked fine even if she landed in Florida. Why the *furthest possible point* away from them, barring actually leaving the planet? 

This is all assuming that there *is* something to the ""I don't think it likes me"" line in Rings of Akhaten. What do you guys think? Is there something to the line, but the Cold War dematerialization is unrelated? Was that line just a joke to begin with?

The line once penned by Moffat in jest for the Doctor Who parody *The Curse of the Fatal Death* has gradually became a straight-faced catalyst for the actual show, and it's been snowballing for seasons now.

I, like many others, felt incredibly let down at the conclusion of Series Five. After an entire season of showing us all these cracks we were treated to a lot of build up, but very little explanation. Why did the TARDIS explode? How? This wasn't just a mild curiosity, it was what the entire Fifth Series had built up to.

Then we get a who: The Silence. But we're still left wanting for a why and a how, and even more whys crop up. Since the Sixth Series this mysterious order that had been pumped up for an entire season has completely vanished.

I should repeat that: There has been **absolutely no mention of the Silence for over a year and a half**. I should also mention that there has been **absolutely no mention of the TARDIS exploding for two years** (and no genuine exploration of the TARDIS exploding for almost three years).

And then we have the larger questions that have been introduced: What is the Doctor's name, why is it important, and probably the most artificial of all these questions: What on earth is Clara?

It's question after question after question, and all we've gotten is... nothing. It almost feels like the case is cold. That they're moving past the TARDIS exploding and the Silence. Now we have The Great Intelligence (how is he still alive? What's his importance?) and the Shakri. 

And then we have to take a look at the answers we have been given, probably the one definitive answer Moffat's reign has ever addressed: River.

And we all know how that turned out: An unmitigated, convoluted, last-second soap opera-ready disaster of forced, false drama that completely failed to live up to the hype.

For the past two and a half years the show's just been ""we'll explain later"", with no indication that they ever intend to. It's like a little kid cycling through new toys, never putting away the ones they got out first. It's been feeling unfun and empty, and it's beyond just irritating.

This is especially noticeable in The Five Doctors and The Three Doctors, the later versions of The Doctor noticeably consult The First Doctor like a wise old man, William Hartnell's Doctor seems to put himself above his later incarnations often calling The Fifth Doctor ""young man"" even though the Fifth Doctor is much older than him. 

Also the way the Doctor's act changed to much more happy, child-like and often brash ways each regeneration for example Patrick Troughton became this happy, jovial character, Pertwee played the Doctor as a heroic young man. From then on many of the  incarnations of the Doctor, with some exceptions appeared younger and more foolish than the earlier versions.

* We've got the line by Oswin, ""What's a word for screaming genius that's modest and just a little bit sexy?"" and the reply: ""Doctor. You call me the Doctor.""

* And then of course the Eggs + stir + minute = souffle = exterminate play on words. Oswin was resisting her urge to exterminate by baking souffles. As the 11th said in the beginning of the story- she was fighting the Daleks by baking souffles. More literally than we thought.

* Amy tells the Doctor that her marriage isn't something he can fix like he fixes his bowtie. Yet after he slips Amy his bracelet and the couple make up, we turn to a shot of the Doctor fixing his bowtie.

* And then the Dalek/Oswin dialogue is brilliant. Especially the way the Dalek's voice nicely switches to Oswin's and back. Very good stuff here.

* I can't *not* mention how awesome it was to see Skaro. Screw continuity, I loved seeing the CGI architecture so reminiscent of classic Who...and the Gallifrey capitol now that I think of it. And the Exxilon, Spiridon, Aridius, Vulcan, Kembel reference.

* The scene with Rory and the Eggs Dalek was just brilliant. It was funny when Rory thought they were eggs, it was suspenseful when the Daleks began to stir, and helped slide in the whole eggs + stir + minute motif.

* Last applaud for the usual clean streamlined sets and effects that Doctor Who has sported since 2010. Plus just all those Daleks. I love Daleks.

* The creation of the concept of the path network. Very good and logic idea on Moffat's part. It makes sense that the Daleks would have a central intelligence. They're not a hivemind, but since uniformity is a big thing for Daleks it makes sense that they'd have some kind of mental link with each other.

Some other things to note would be, however much people may not like the infertility thing, the acting in that scene was superb. I really think Amy and Rory had some of their strongest character moments right here. Up there with Girl Who Waited, you can see the emotion oozing off them.

And of course, barring the lack of active classic Daleks and the slight production error, it was fantastic to see the pepperpots running around being scary again. Maybe not terrifying, but Moffat put a new spin on them. Whether or not you like the direction the Daleks have now been guided toward it is new and it is interesting.

Really, besides the series 1 Dalek stories, Asylum has got to be my new favorite new Who Dalek story. Brilliant brilliant. Now I know it's not perfect, there are a couple things that strike me odd:

* The line: ""Rescue me chin-boy and show me the stars!""
* ""Who killed all the Daleks?"" ""Who do you think?""
* ""On a scale of ten? Eleven.""
* The Doctor repeating ""Doctor Who"" at the end. This especially.
* Daleks with a concept of beauty, bit odd.

And then of course the one thing everybody is going on about: the infertility. It's not sexist, it's not unrealistic or unbelievable. The acting of Gillian and Darvill makes up for the quick pacing of the make-up. I think that breakup over infertility is a concept that's harder for younger people to understand (like me). It's a bit of an old fashioned idea but even so there are (as I've been told by many) lots of couples who still break up over it. It's still a big deal. I think interpretation will vary person to person. I've talked to older people (30-60+ years), some of which who thought it was a big deal and others who thought it was a bit outdated or unrealistic. We've come upon a very real life situation in Doctor Who and feelings upon it are as varied as the people who watch the show. In all I guess that's a good thing. If everybody had the same opinion then diversity would be just that little bit less.  We're not Daleks after all. We're human.

1362715425.0,130,self.gallifrey,19w4t3,Steven Moffat and Memory,141,11,45,http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/19w4t3/steven_moffat_and_memory/,"I think everyone here at r/Gallifrey can agree on something: Steven Moffat can write a great story. Despite what you think of the show since he took over as head writer, I think most people agree that “The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances,” “The Girl In The Fireplace,” “Blink,” and “Silence In The Library/Forest of the Dead” are incredible stories, and that Moffat has the ability to craft very good stories.


Something I noticed today was that the idea of remembering and memory plays a huge role in Doctor Who from the moment Moffat begins his run.  We start with “The Eleventh Hour,” and Amy Pond. Amy –- The Girl Who Waited -– or, alternatively: “The Girl Who Didn’t Forget.” Amy meets The Doctor for one night as a child, and doesn’t forget. She tells everyone about him. Tenuous, but stay with me.

The story arc of the fifth series is the crack in time. What’s a major feature of the crack? People forget about your entire existence. 	Amy even forgets Rory because of this.  She later remembers him, but is nearly killed in the process, causing the whole “Last Centurion” idea that helps define Rory’s character.


And let’s not forget that Amy brings The Doctor back into existence by remembering him. 

Flash forward to the sixth series, and you get The Silence. I don’t think I need to explain how The Silence relates to memory and forgetfulness.  Also, The Doctor spends a lot of time deleting himself from memory banks and records across the universe.

In Series 7, you have “Asylum of the Daleks.” In that episode, Clara forgets that she has actually been transformed into a Dalek. The episode ends after Clara deletes The Doctor from the Daleks’ collective memory. I think this is an incredibly important plot point that is kind of glossed over in this sub – The Doctor’s greatest enemy no longer remembers who he is.

Now, what does this mean? I think, from a pseudo-psychological standpoint, it reflects heavily on Moffat. He devoted a whole season to the Silence, so he clearly values memory and thinks it’s incredibly scary to lose. I think Moffat, a huge Who fan his entire life, is worried about how he’ll be remembered as a writer for the show. But that’s just my high school psychology thinking.

But what does it mean for the show? I think it all comes back to the fields of Trenzalore and The Question. I’m 100 percent sure Moffat is coming to come back to this – it’s too important not to. I think The Question, “Doctor who?” will be The Doctor asking who he is. He will have forgotten himself –- literally or figuratively.

1368399228.0,121,self.gallifrey,1e7jbv,A Brief Break From Popular Opinion - Why I Am Thoroughly Enjoying Series 7B So Far,139,18,78,http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/1e7jbv/a_brief_break_from_popular_opinion_why_i_am/,"Lately, I have noticed a lot of negativity floating around towards the current state of the show and the quality of the recent episodes, especially in Series 7a and 7b. In the past few weeks alone I've seen three or four separate posts about why they don't like this series so far. I thought it would be good to counter this flow of negativity with my own positive opinions and see if there's anyone else out there who feels the same. So here are some of the reasons why I am very much enjoying Series 7b so far. 



Firstly, the series has a very diverse and well rounded set of locations. The whole ""21st Century London"" trope doesn't very well fit here, only one of the eight episodes takes place there. The setting of the episodes are all over the place, which is how a show like Doctor Who should be. Alien planets, Russian submarines, haunted houses, and the TARDIS itself. I prefer episodes that are aided by their location, *The Impossible Astronaut / Day of the Moon* was good because it was about 1960's America, while *Silence In The Library / Forest of the Dead* had the brilliant concept of an entire planet as a library. This seemed lost from a lot of recent episodes, *Power Of Three*, *Angels Take Manhattan*, *Night Terrors* and *The Girl Who Waited*, among others, had plot lines that could essentially happen anywhere and their setting did very little to add to the story. Conversely, *Rings Of Akhaten* benefited well from the new planet, *Nightmare In Silver* gained immensely from the run-down amusement park in creepiness factor, and *The Crimson Horror* gained a nice period-piece feeling from its Victorian setting. As minor as it seems, I feel that small things like diverse and well established settings drastically improve the quality of any episode, as they not only provide a better atmosphere for the plot but also better fit the whole ""time-and-space travel"" idea. 



Secondly, the writing is much better this series than in previous ones. A lot of people have peculiar gripes about individual episodes, I know a lot of people didn't like *Rings Of Akhaten* for this reason or *Cold War* for that reason, but we have still yet to see another *Love And Monsters* or *42*. Those were fundamentally bad episodes with poor premises and poor writing. *Rings Of Akhaten* may have fallen a bit flat, a hastily introduced Big Bad and a ""Love Conquers All""-esque ending, but as far as filler episodes goes, it did have its enjoyable moments and was sparse in cringe-worthy ones. The same is true for *Cold War*, which was forgettable but not entirely *bad*. And while the filler episodes aren't nearly as bad as before, the good episodes are really very good. *Hide* was a fantastic episode with a unique premise and wonderful characters, *The Crimson Horror* was a fun mystery that benefited greatly from a less Doctor-centric plot, and *Nightmare In Silver* was full of fantastic ideas and nearly flawless execution. People seem to gripe about current seasons and long for previous ones, but I think you need to compare each season's good episodes to good episodes and filler episodes to filler episodes. And when you do that, this season seems to be a general improvement, since the fillers arent as bad, and the good episodes are just as good. 



Additionally, Clara has been a wonderful companion so far. Ignoring the whole ""impossible girl"" mystery for now, and going on the basic points of companionship and character, she's everything you could ask for. She's intelligent but not overly brainy, she's brave but not overly courageous, and she respects the Doctor and follows his lead when she needs to. As a result, the Doctor has treated Clara very well. Rather than being a sidekick, or someone being led on a tour guide, the two work together in a fantastic dynamic. The Doctor can be the boss making decisions, like in *Cold War*, but Clara can just as easily assume leadership, like in *Nightmare in Silver*. There is no imbalance or love interest or power struggle between the two - in each episode, they work very well as what they are supposed to be. Companions. 



Lastly, the story arcs over the whole season have been done very well. The subject of story arcs is the biggest source of criticism in the recent few series of the show and one of the biggest beefs most people have with Steven Moffat. While I don't think the show is being ruined or run into the ground, I do agree on some level that as of late the story arc method has been done poorly. For the most part, it's been **way** over the top. During Series 6, we had something like three story arcs going, and it ended up consuming entire episodes just to move the plot along (*A Good Man Goes To War*, *Let's Kill Hitler* and *The Wedding of River Song* are what I'm referring to - practically impossible to rewatch as stand alone episodes since they are devoted entirely to resolving story arcs). It seems that recently we would have arcs introduced to us with big huge implications and they would consume entire episodes and then they would just be dropped. However, Series 7b doesn't suffer from this nearly as much. We have two story arcs going - The Name of the Doctor and the Identity of Clara Oswald. While these both are either obviously or potentially very important mysteries, they are not obnoxiously dramatic like previous ones. The Cracks In The Wall arc ended with the explosion of the TARDIS and the end of all of time and space, the Death of the Doctor arc ended with the Doctor's Death and the end of all of time and space, but these arcs aren't of that huge or cliche'd caliber. They are relevant, they're intriguing, but not universe-threatening, which is good, because that has become an old trope. They also haven't overpowered the entire series. We get some advancement as the series goes along (""She's just an ordinary girl"" from *Hide* and the Doctor's exposition near the end of *Journey to the Centre of the TARDIS*), but it's possible to watch an episode from this series and feel like you're watching an individual adventure, not a misplaced chapter from a series-long novel. I'm also hopeful for the series finale next week, *The Name of the Doctor*. This one, actually, does look like an episode that will be consumed by story arcs, but it has the potential to conclude them in such a way that it would be a satisfying and fulfilling resolution. We have several unanswered questions going around right now, Who Exploded The TARDIS, How Does River Song Get To The Library, What Is Important About The Doctor's Identity, Why Is Clara Impossible, How Does The Great Intelligence Fit Into This, and this episode has the ability to answer all of these. I for one feel that if these arcs are concluded well, then it was worth having them introduced in the first place, and it would be a good episode to watch them be resolved. Plus, if in fact it does answer them all, we may then be able to return in Series 8 to more relaxed story arcs.



This is all how I feel about this series. I've never truly disliked any series, so I suppose I'm an easy fan to please. However, after a somewhat disappointing run in series 6b and 7a, I think that 7b is a vast improvement and I'm quite enjoying the run so far. So what say you all? I hope I'm not the only one around here who is happy with the show.

First - The Tardis exists simultaneously throughout space and time.

Second - The Tardis always takes the Doctor where he needs to go.

If the Tardis exists throughout space and time, that means the Tardis knows everything that has happened and everything that will happen.  And knowing this much, the Tardis can put the Doctor at exactly the right time and place for him to succeed and be victorious.  Further, the Tardis can put the right Doctor in at the right point in his life, along with the right companion(s) to achieve victory.  

So if the second Doctor would fail in one situation and the tenth Doctor would succeed, the Tardis lands the  tenth Doctor there -- and vice-versa.  If the eleventh Doctor, with Amy,  would fail, but the same Doctor with Clara would succeed, the Tardis put the Eleventh with Clara in.

Moreover, if the eleventh Doctor would not succeed on the Dalek asylum planet  if Oswin had not been there, or Oswin had only been there a month, the Tardis would not have taken the Doctor to Sako when she did.

Also, the Tardis knows that the Doctor needs to keep occupied, he needs a challenge, he needs an adventure and he needs to pull victory from the jaws of defeat using native wit and cunning.  So if a threat would tax number ten to his limits, but be a walk in the park for number one, the Tardis would go to the time and place with number ten and let him be sucked into that fray.  And vice-versa.

The Tardis is the unsuspected hand of fate for the Universe and the Doctor.  This brings up the third thing we learned about the Tardis. She stole the Doctor. She stole the Doctor and ran away to see the universe. And the only Time Lord mad enough to let himself be taken was one who needed the challenge of saving the universe time and time again to keep the boredom away.",,False,,t5_2tf29,False,,,True,t3_18ano2,http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/18ano2/the_tardis_is_the_hand_of_fate_in_the_doctor_who/,

How has it been?,128,11,136,http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/1f7h8g/is_anyone_else_doing_a_full_doctor_who_run_in/,"I started a full run of Doctor Who several months ago, with the goal of completing the entire TV series right before the 50th. I've heard other people mention they are as well, so I figured I would start this thread so we can discuss how it has been so far.

I'm currently in the middle of the Fourth Doctor serial Meglos. I'm a little sad that I'll be seeing him go at the end of the season, but I'm excited for a less aggressive and more caring Fifth Doctor. I have to say, while I do love Four, I'd still rank the Doctors I've completed on this run as Two, Three, Four, One. Two is a wonderful combination of curiosity, cunning, and goofiness that is just so fun to watch, and I love Three's fatherly know-it-all attitude and hands-on approach to the bad guys. Four is a bit of a jerk, and acts ""random"" to the point of being almost as bad as the YouTube videos of ""random"" teenagers you find in r/cringe. He is also knocked unconscious WAY too much for me, he must get knocked out in at least 3/4s of the episodes. One is an amusing combination of curious, arrogant, and selfish, but doesn't quite have the depth of personality the others do.

It's been a tad weird completing Four in parallel to Season 7, but it was fun to compare two peaks in the Doctor Who history. Four and Eleven are both formidable opponents, and the Black Guardian and the Great Intelligence show interesting parallels in the way they guide a large arc as a mysterious enemy.

I personally can't wait for Six and Trial of a Time Lord. I'm also still working out how I'll do Eight - I feel like I need to do more than just the movie, so I'm going to select some books as well. I think I'm ahead of schedule, so it shouldn't be a problem to add some reading.

1349112441.0,119,self.gallifrey,10rpih,My Theory on 1938 [Angels Take Manhattan Spoilers].,143,24,49,http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/10rpih/my_theory_on_1938_angels_take_manhattan_spoilers/,"A lot of people have been complaining about how it doesn't make sense that the Doctor can't go back to 1938, or wait a year and go back to 1939 to pick up Amy and Rory. I interpreted the episode in a totally different way, so here's what I thought:

The angels in Manhattan are not in 1938, *per se*. They aren't in *our* 1938. Obviously, this is true, otherwise I think we would have heard about it. *Our* Statue of Liberty is not actually a weeping angel. The weeping angels essentially ""carved"" out a chunk of time for themselves to use as a time energy farm. They made a little section of time that they could send people back to over and over again. 

That's why the TARDIS couldn't lock onto it. The Doctor should be able to go to *normal* 1938, but River and Rory weren't in normal 1938, they were in *fucked-up-angels-took-over* 1938. This is also the reason that when Rory created a paradox in that world, it didn't blow up present day New York (or, if you will, ""Doctor's Timeline New York""). It's not the same New York.

A few other things: 

* The graveyard happened to be the tie-in to Angel Farm Manhattan because that was where all of the victims of the Angel Farm were laid to rest. That's why the TARDIS kept landing there. The graveyard has a temporal connection to the Angel Farm.

* Rory and Amy cannot be picked up in 1939 because they're not in 1939. Ever. The angels continue to loop them and they are stuck in Winter Quay, 1938. It's just like when Rory saw his old self, *in 1938*. They didn't send him back to the 1900s so that he could live to be old. No, they kept looping him, over and over until he got old. The only difference is that now Amy is with him and they got to loop continuously in 1938 together. 

* People have been bitching about how they got food to the Winter Quay. People aren't stuck in that room. They can leave, and can walk around, but eventually, an angel is going to get them and send them back again. They aren't locked in the room, they just keep getting sent back until they are old and bedridden and eventually die in that room. 

* River doesn't go back to Angel Farm Manhattan to deliver the book to Amy. We know River is good at getting messages to people in weird times. In the episode, she says she'll ""send"" the manuscript to Amy to get published, not that she'll personally deliver it. 

* ""Why can't the Doctor just pay somebody to make a gravestone with Amy and Rory's name on it?"" The tombstone is merely *symbolic*. Amy and Rory don't die *because* their names are on the tombstone. Their names are on the tombstone *because* they died. There's nothing saying that the Doctor couldn't change their fate at that point. The tombstone is not like the book and nobody said that it couldn't be changed. The book is something from their future timelines (because River and Amy write it later) and that's why it has power. The tombstone is no such power. It is *just a tombstone.*

* The Doctor doesn't think that he *physically can't* go back to the Angel Farm Manhattan, he *won't* because he's already fucked with it too much and it's too risky. Also his TARDIS looks like it's about to fall apart. 

* Another note about the tombstone, people have been saying that the numbers after their names mean that Rory died in '82 and Amy in '87. Not true. That's their ages. If it was a date, it would show their birthdate, as in ""1938-1987."" Also, it's a tombstone, so I'm sure it would be the full date ""*19*87."" Amy was five years older than Rory (probably because of time traveling). Rory died at age 82 (in 1938); Amy died at age 87 (in 1938). 

* No ""new rules"" were invented for this episode. River consistently doesn't tell the Doctor about his future because of ""spoilers."" We have never really seen what she's talking about until now. Now, you understand why she doesn't want to give him any ""spoilers."" It can seriously fuck shit up when you know about your own future timeline. This isn't new to the series (well, it's new as of the re-boot, but it's been consistently applied since the introduction of the rule). Even regarding the ""Library"" episodes, the Doctor knows that he can't go save River, because she died in his timeline already.

1369410697.0,121,self.gallifrey,1ez5v3,"What do you think the story will be going forward from ""The Name of The Doctor""?",140,19,58,http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/1ez5v3/what_do_you_think_the_story_will_be_going_forward/,"My personal theory:

John Hurt is the Time War incarnation of the Doctor, be he aged 8 or between 8 and 9, doesn't matter. The events of the 50th anniversary will see the Doctor (11) seek to ""undo"" the great evil that Hurt Doctor did, i.e. the Time Lock. He takes Hurt with him and picks up 10 along the way. With three Doctors working together simultaneously, they will try to find a better solution, one that avoids the destruction of Gallifrey and the Daleks and somehow manages to end the time war, all in one big happy ending. However, I don't think they will succeed in finding that solution and the season/special will end with the Time Lock being applied and we'll leave just as Hurt STARTS his regeneration, or immediately after it finishes if they want to edit in shots of the 9th.

The interesting part is that they whole episode/series will take place from INSIDE the 11th Doctor's time stream. I mean, his companion is already there and they can step directly into the timeline of the 10th Doctor and Rose, to have effectively three time lords and two humans all working together inside the time stream. No one back on Trenzalore will see any of it or know what's going on. It may all occur in the blink of an eye to them.

(Put on tinfoil hat here, if it's not on already)

The Silence know the only way the time lock can be defeated is for the Doctor to enter his own time stream and to effectively rewrite the event. This is what they are seeking to avoid and what the three (2.5?) Doctors will figure out: that unlocking the Time War will destroy the universe. They fear that the 11th will do just that, and alone he might have. But, together, the 10th and Hurt will stop him at the last moment, to make him see that he ultimately did the right thing all those years ago.

(Extra Layer of tinfoil required beyond this point, stay away from the microwave)

Alternatively, they DO unlock the Time War or prevent the time lock, but the change in the timeline tears the fabric of time and space, causing the whole war to spill out of the 11th Doctors time stream and onto the Fields of Trenzalore, but thanks to that tear, they are all at a point in time BEFORE the planet is ravaged by the battle. The 8th season will be about the time war playing out on Trenzalore and the Time Lords attempting to get back to Gallifrey to fulfill their plan to destroy the universe. The 11th will stop them, ultimately sacrificing himself while possibly simultaneously killing all of the Time Lords and the Daleks on Trenzalore (at least all of the Time Lords that wanted to destroy the universe). Before the new 12th leaves Trenzalore, he takes one of the TARDISes of one of the other time lords, sets its chameleon circuit to exactly match his TARDIS, and leaves it behind as the marker they find in the finale, knowing that one day he will have to return to this place upon his final death, to replace that TARDIS with his own...

but not today.

1361723006.0,119,self.gallifrey,194xap,Could the Silence arc actually be a Valeyard arc? SPOILERS,130,11,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/194xap/could_the_silence_arc_actually_be_a_valeyard_arc/,"I know a lot of people here have huge issues with the Valeyard, and he's brought up a lot. However, if Modern Who didn't want to eventually address it, I don't think they would have ever touched the Dream Lord. In my mind, the Dream Lord was a reminder for both the Doctor and the viewers that the darkness is there and the Valeyard is still coming. With the existence of the meta-crisis Doctor, the writers have made it clear that there are many ways to split the Doctor and produce the Valeyard. In addition, I think it is the Valeyard he sees in the God Complex. This will make more sense later.

We know the Valeyard comes into existence at some point between the 12th and final incarnation of the Doctor. We also know something happens at the fall of the 11th.

“On the fields of Trenzalore, at the fall of the eleventh, when no living creature can speak falsely or fail to answer, a Question will be asked, a question that must never, ever be answered.”

Something happens when 11 dies, something so bad that there is an organization/religion focused on stopping it from ever happening. There are two major mysteries here:

How do they know this?
Why can't the question be answered?

We don't know who made the prophecy, and I don't think it's a prophecy at all. I think someone who can travel through time knows something bad happens at the point in the Doctor's time line. Obviously, whatever happens only happens in reference to the Doctor's time line, unless he somehow dies outside of Time. He's been to all ends of time and has no idea what is going to happen and why it's so bad. Thus, the prophecy isn't a fortune, but rather is valuable information passed on by another time traveler.

That brings up the second point. Why is the Question bad? What will happen when it is answered? If the Doctor is dying and the answer is spoken to a enemy, we can only assume the enemy can use that information because the Doctor does NOT defeat him. However, what if the answer to the question isn't dangerous because an enemy knows the answer, but because the Doctor does? 

When the Doctor dies, he seems to inherent a lof of his new personality based on his last incarnation's experiences. Perhaps the Question is so existentially destructive to the Doctor that it defines his regeneration. That's why the Question cannot be asked - because it will take the Doctor down the dark path towards the Valeyard. In addition, this is why I think he saw the Valeyard in the God Complex. He knows that eventually the Valeyard is coming, and he hears the Cloister Bell, a warning of danger. His biggest fear is becoming the Valeyard, so when he sees the Valeyard, possibly with his TARDIS, his response is ""Of course, who else?"". 

When the Valeyard comes into the picture, we don't know where 12 is. We don't know how long the Valeyard has existed. But we do know that he comes after the fall of the 11th. Disregarding re-writing time, the darkness that defines the Valeyard will be affected by the events experienced by 11th, and since the Silence arc has overwhelmingly defined this incarnation, the Silence arc must be related to that evil. 

This leaves me with this theory:

The Valeyard is created due to the darkness that grows in the Doctor when the Question is finally asked. In my opinion, the question, ""Doctor, who?"" is most likely not ""who are you?"" but ""who will you choose?"". Either way, the answer is something that the Doctor will struggle with, bringing out his darkness in a way that he can't control, eventually creating the Valeyard either during his regeneration or after an extremely existential run as 12. This is why the question cannot be asked.

The prophecy comes from the Valeyard himself. In order to set the darkness into motion, the events experienced by 11 must occur. Perhaps part of the Doctor's existential crisis is related to the fact that he fought to save himself, at the expense of the lives of others, when he was the true evil all along. The is what he realizes when he answers the Question, spawning the series of events that leads to the creation of the Valeyard. This also explains why the Valeyard goes back to try to defeat 6 - the Valeyward know's he can't actually kill the Doctor because he's already witness his own defeat, but he also knows that the experience of battling the Valeyard will begin the process of creating the Valeyard.

People love discussing the Valeyard because he's one of the most mysterious characters in Doctor Who. I really wouldn't be surprised if the writers have are just as interested in him. While I could be extremely far off and absolutely wrong, I'd love to see this happen.

* ""You're doing your other voice!""

Nice spotting taylortheunicorn!

* **EDIT** ViridianPanther has also pointed out the use of ladders in Clara's adventures! The ladder down to the Asylum and the ladder up to the Tardis. I wonder what this could mean? Awesome catch ViridianPanther!

1376251622.0,116,self.gallifrey,1k5t9v,"I just passed the Eighth Doctor movie in my full TV run...and it might be one of my favorite ""episodes"" of all time. Can we seriously discuss the pros and cons? Long post ahead.",145,29,107,http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/1k5t9v/i_just_passed_the_eighth_doctor_movie_in_my_full/,"Personally, I loved this movie. Here's my analysis of the pros and cons.

Seventh Doctor Regeneration

I loved this regeneration. There is something beautiful about the Doctor dying due to senseless gang violence and human misunderstanding. Somehow, after roughly a thousand years of meddling in the affairs of gun-wielding psychopaths, the Doctor has almost always avoided being shot, and when he has been, he has only been stunned. Here, while he is not shot fatally, he is finally seriously wounded. The Seventh Doctor, the most cunning, manipulative Doctor known to us currently, the Doctor who literally talks to people into suicide on more than one occasion, shot by simple-minded gangsters. The world is absurd and uncaring, and even the Doctor can't avoid the senselessness at times.

His real death is due to the botched surgery, and that just adds a second level of awesomeness. The doctor is trying to save him. But she only feels the need to save him because she does not understand his irregular heart beat, and he dies because of this misguided heroism. We see the Doctor display this type of misguided heroism all the time, jumping into conflict in an attempt to save the day. Here, when someone else does the same, it all goes wrong. The Doctor dies at the hand of a flaw he himself suffers from.

The Introduction of the Eighth Doctor

Amnesia is often an over-used plot device, but I liked it a lot here. The Doctor didn't just rediscover himself, but the crowd gets to rediscover him as well. Amnesia blends well with the child-like awe of the Eighth Doctor, and I think the scene where he describes Gallifrey especially displays this. However, it would have worked better if the movie was longer. It takes up a little more time than you'd like for a movie that is only an hour and a half.

The Eighth Doctor

I don't think anyone has ever argued that the Eighth Doctor ISN'T wonderful. He has a strong sense of romanticism and awe, as you'd except from someone who has spent so much time travelling through space and time. I like how he contrasts with the Seventh Doctor - while the Seventh Doctor manipulates people in very dark way, often leading to war and destruction, the Eighth Doctor manipulates time in a more subtle, light-hearted way by giving them advice to help them in their future experiences. The only con here is that there isn't more of him in the TV series.

Grace

Grace is very Liz Shaw-like, and I loved Liz Shaw. However, she has more personality and she is incredibly passionate, just like the Eighth Doctor. The scene where she cries at the opera - as the Eighth Doctor finds himself, you know they're perfect for each other. Her response to the Doctor is far more realistic than the response of many other characters (not just in the movie, but in the entire series). She's also pretty much the best American character up to the movie (seriously, she blows Peri away). However, she does set the romantic relationship precedent, which is one of my major problems with Modern Who.

Chang

Chang reminded me strongly of Turlough. Chang acts incredibly human, which is what I like most. While he seems to change his mind rather quickly, it's obvious at the beginning of the movie, when he chooses to call the ambulance and wait for the surgery to be finished, that he's more than a wannabe gangster. I like that they follow it up later and he takes a stand. However, the acting isn't great and we don't learn enough to identify with him strongly.

The Master

I first thought I would hate him, but in fact I ended up loving him. I like that they kept up the Master's strong desire to escape death, and I like that it ties in well with Grace's similar desire to defeat death (by way of saving others, rather than herself). I felt like despite the body, dress, and American accent, I could definitely see the Master hiding behind the body.  The Master was incredibly well done in Classic, but in no way was this Master bad. He's definitely an improvement on the melt-man Master in The Deadly Assassin, but I do think the other Classic Masters and Modern Masters were done better.

The TARDIS

This was the best TARDIS ever, in my opinion. I like that he combined the control room with some living space. I've never been super excited by steampunk, but I would live on the set if I could. 

The Eye of Harmony Plot

This plot greatly improves on The Deadly Assassin, where it's not exactly clear how the Master is going to use the Eye to obtain more lives. I like that he wants to take them from the Doctor, rather just be given them by the High Counsel. The sense of urgency about the Eye helped make the pace seem reasonable for the given danger, and I liked the distorted window scene, as it was both aesthetically interesting and harked back to Classic's ""weird sci-fi stuff is happening, no time to explain"" tendency. The half-human thing is of course the most controversial, but I think it's great that we have it to argue about. In my head cannon, the half-human aspect was a trick on the part of the Doctor to make sure no Time Lord could ever take control of his TARDIS. I like the idea that he used the fob watch to make himself half-human, but obviously unless they directly address it, we'll never know. It could have been done without, but it sure added an interesting aspect to the Doctor Who history.

Overall Production

I felt this was a very American-esque movie. As an American, this doesn't bother me a bit, but it may bother some of you across the pond. The acting wasn't great, but it was better than a lot of the Classic Who acting. Also, the budget was pretty big and the effects were improved, so it was definitely the most aesthetically pleasing piece of Doctor Who as the time.

Agree? Disagree? It would be great to have a serious discussion. The move it often given quite a hard time, but I just can't see why. I really loved it, and it will certainly be part of my line-up for the week preceding the 50th.

I think that he was one of the best villains in the show, and I think there are a few key differences that really make the GI stand out:

-The GI feels. Intensely. The vehement hatred was practically dripping from him when he was describing the Doctor to the others in front of the Doctor's grave. The Daleks, the Cybermen, the Silence and their affiliates, and other less featured or one off baddies try to be without emotion, but they eventually end up showing hate or disgust. I think this weakens them, as it breaks their own code and usually is the key factor in their defeat. I think that the anger and rage are what fueled the GI, and as they are the driving force behind his actions they only make him stronger as they increase. This can be seen in the Master as well, at least in New Who. 

-The GI isn't over powered. His inability to be killed may seem souped up, but the plot didn't rely on it at all. His henchmen only had to stop the hearts of the Doctor's companions, a very simple procedure that doesn't require crazy, rare artifacts or super powers. As Strax says, ""The heart is a simple thing.""

-He actually got physical with the Doctor. Usually the Doctor yells and points his screwdriver to make his enemies go away, but the GI isn't intimidated by him or his reputation. The GI becomes animalistic, trying to be the alpha male in the situation by making eye contact, being above the Doctor, grabbing him in a way that incited violence, etc. I can't even remember the last time a villain laid hands on the Doctor, and it made him seem incredibly vulnerable without the armor of his reputation. 

So, what do you think? Is the GI better than most? Have I gone stark raving mad?

It's one of the most unique relationships on television, and their dynamic has only gotten more lively as the TARDIS has been given more and more ""alive"" qualities since the 1996 film.

But my real point is that the magical quality of their bond hinges on the very thing that makes it unique: the fact that it's unspoken.

I'm quite firmly of the opinion that giving the TARDIS a voice is a lazy (or at the very least, much simpler and easier) way of giving her personality and poking the plot along easier. 

As the TARDIS is given a more literal voice I can't help but feel that a lot of the character's magic goes away. The idea of the TARDIS having a ""holographic voice interface"" not only makes very little sense and flies in the face of common sense and show history, but it drastically cheapens the character and makes prior events seem virtually meaningless.

***THE DOCTOR'S WIFE***

*The Doctor's Wife* was the first episode where we really see the TARDIS and the Doctor entering into a dialogue. In fact, this very unique opportunity is addressed quite explicitly in the episode:

&gt; DOCTOR: You did. Look at us talking. **Wouldn't it be amazing if we could always talk, even when you're stuck inside the box?**   
IDRIS: You know **I'm not constructed that way.** I exist across all space and time, and you talk and run around and bring home strays.

#

&gt; IDRIS: It's sad when it's over. I'll always be here, but **this is when we talked, and now even that has come to an end.** There's something I didn't get to say to you.   
DOCTOR: Goodbye?   
IDRIS: No. I just wanted to say hello. Hello, Doctor. It's so very, very nice to meet you.   
DOCTOR: Please. I don't want you to. Please. 

The scene. That incredibly heart-rending, passionate, moving scene *hinges* on the Doctor not being able to speak to the TARDIS, on the TARDIS not being able to speak to anyone.

This entire moment is *ruined* by having the TARDIS have a little chat with Clara. Once you show the TARDIS being able to bicker and hold proper conversations then you've *completely* drained the power out of that scene. You've made it *meaningless*.

***THE MAGIC OF THE TARDIS***

The TARDIS is one of the few truly mysterious and magical things in Doctor Who. We've learned about the Doctor's home planet, his people, his love life, and now up-and-coming (apparently) [S7E14 SPOILERS](#s ""his name""), but we've never really explored the TARDIS.

It's been this mysterious being, something that's beyond the corporeal, something that's got this inexplicable magic to it. 

The beauty of the TARDIS is that she's not the Enterprise. There's no ""onboard computer"" that you can ask to analyze things and give you a report on your blood's toxicity levels. She hasn't got an EMH or holodeck or some interactive virtual personality. She's so much more than that, and it irks me to no end to see something as beautiful and mysterious as the TARDIS get turned into one of the most pervasive cliches in science fiction.

1366260849.0,113,self.gallifrey,1cl6cl,On the Sonic Screwdriver as magic wand that does everything the plot needs it to,135,22,91,http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/1cl6cl/on_the_sonic_screwdriver_as_magic_wand_that_does/,"I've always thought the Sonic part implied that it manipulated the air waves, much like sound, except on a much more advanced and accurate scale. [Which isn't crazy to imagine alien technology doing it very well, sufficiently advanced to be indistinguishable from magic, Gallifreyan after all, since we humans are getting very good at it to even at this point in history.](http://youtu.be/myWxwNQfo-8?t=2m37s)

It's operated simply by a button, but it's controlled through a telepathic field. If it is controlled through your thoughts with the very air as its tool (and with a telepathic field one can assume an advanced Wi-Fi is in there) there isn't much that would be out of its range. 

/r/gallifrey, or at least a vocal part of it seems to be so distressed by how much the Doctor uses it (occasionally taking the opportunity to  single out Eleven and Moffat. Though rewatchs of Ten and Nine show they use it a hell of a lot too). 

Its functions seem spectacular but it is a spectacular tool, which is why the Doctor chooses to use it. Yes there are some things that just seem odd (like the Doctor using it to scan to see if someone is hurt), but things like holding up a really heavy door, or repelling a force field, hacking, all feel like it would fall squarely within its range and not be too crazy to do, it just depends on the energy level its using, which is why the Doctor seems to take a lot of effort in using it for heavy tasks, like that door in the Rings of Akahten. 

Saying its a crutch isn't a vacuous complaint, but it's not as if every episode goes crazy with using it as storyline resolutions. ",DISCUSSION,False,,t5_2tf29,1366305803.0,h,,True,t3_1cl6cl,http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/1cl6cl/on_the_sonic_screwdriver_as_magic_wand_that_does/,

Okay, new and last post for discussion about the actual announcement. [Part1](http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/1jo7s6/aug_4th_bbc_special_event_mega_thread_this_post/) &amp; [Part2](http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/1joujy/aug_4th_bbc_special_event_mega_thread_part_2_this/)


This is the last Mega post we will be making, sorry for all of these. I really didn't think the first two would be so inundated with comments before the announcement.


This will be the Official thread for discussion about the casting announcement, not the BBC Special.

This will be a spoiler 'free for all' post. Comments do not need to be tagged with the (#s) spoiler code. Read the comments at your own risk.


New posts about this announcement will be removed so we don't have clutter all about the same thing. The mods will be removing both links and self posts about the casting news during the day but will go back to the normal routine late Sunday/Monday.



Please note that going back to the normal routine means 'No Spoilers in Titles'. If you want to discuss the casting news, do not put that directly in your title or the post will be removed. ""Why I disagree with the recent casting news"" is perfectly fine, ""Why I love that Actor-so-and-so is the new Doctor"" is not.

1370249507.0,110,self.gallifrey,1fkkr5,"A fun ""What If"" based on recent news [Spoilers - 50th &amp; possibly S8 if I'm a psychic of some sort]",141,31,66,http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/1fkkr5/a_fun_what_if_based_on_recent_news_spoilers_50th/,"Ok, first I'm going to preface this with my assumptions:

- I'm going to assume that John Hurt is either a very old 8 or the true 9th that they don't count in the Doctor numbering because he did something so against who they feel they are that the Doctors disowned him.

- I'm going to assume that the rumour/news that Matt had signed on to be in who in 2014 came from somewhere BBC way but wasn't meant to come out and misunderstood

**The idea:**

*The 50th:*

A self encapsulated story where 10 &amp; 11 try and stop Hurt doing bad things. They either realise straight away or later (not important when) that he is a part of them and while they succeed in stopping him SOMETHING is done to 11 by Hurt that effects him. You see hints of the dark side of the Doctor come out, the more manipulative shrewd, controlling parts. Still slightly subtle at this point but you know that SOMETHING is happening and that it's not good.

Fast-forward to...

*The Christmas Special:*

The Doctor is losing control of himself. Whatever was triggered in the 50th is slowly taking over him. He has Clara more or less guarding him, making sure he doesn't do anything bad until he can figure a way to rid himself of the darker personality. From time to time it fully takes over, it's getting more and more difficult. They then find some sort of device, a PlotDevice^TM if you will. This can be whatever the writers want, a chanting collection of uber-nuns, a genetic altering supercomputer made by apple in the year 3298, whatever. The important thing is that it is to be used to split the dark personality from the Doctor so he can regain himself.

Frantic things happen to get the Doctor into THE DEVICE^TM a couple of times the darker side takes over and it looks like he is trying to flee. Each time he is put back and finally the device starts, the dark side of the Doctor is pulled away from him. We get some awesome dark glowy cgi to represent the evil personality as it hovers away from the Doctor, we think we've won. Then something happens. Something (an automated defence system, a bribed guard, whatever) comes out and kills the Doctor while he is still in the machine's effect. 

Regeneration begins, we see the usual energy flowing out from the Doctor's limbs and head, he's changing into the 12th (or 13th depending on how the 50th screws up numbering). There's just one difference. Instead of dissipating as normal there is a place for the excess regeneration energy to go, there is a Timelord soul hovering above us. The golden energy mixes with the CGI representation of the darker side of the Doctor, it starts to grow and take the shape of a humanoid. 

The room starts to go into meltdown as things go pop around the new &amp; still unconscious Doctor as things tend to do in New Who when there's a regeneration. There is some sort of announcement that life support is about to give up or something. We see the new Doctor still motionless in the background as a shadowy figure exits, leaving him for dead. We cut close to the face of the newly created being. The look is smug, evil and determined, the shot pulls away as we see him in new clothes from ""plot convenient location"", something all in black, it's Matt Smith but not the fun and jovial Matt Smith we've seen before, he's serious and a little scary. 

We've just witnessed **the birth of the Valeyard**.

That odd joke is probably what I remember most about the episode outside the excellent use of ELO's ""Mr. Blue Sky"".

Another example of something trivial that becomes more disturbing when thought out is the scene in ""Gridlock"" in Thomas Kincade Brannigan's car when The Doctor meets his newborns. The implication being that Brannigan's human wife, Valerie, gave birth to a litter of kittens while trapped in a car stuck in a never ending traffic jam. Can you think of other instances where something trivial or a simple throwaway line in Doctor Who had disturbing or horrifying implications when thought out?

The real threat to the TARDIS and other violences aside (which all seem to genuinely shock our favourite Time Doctor), we saw in the previous episodes that he is orchestrating situations and encounters to flush out the Clara answers.

Was *Journey* a test that went horribly wrong? Or was it a test that went very well for The Doctor's agenda?

Is the urge to find Clara driven by the opportunity to find out more, or genuinely concern for her safety?

Was the TARDIS engine event merely a backdrop to the scene (depicted in the link) where he gets what appears to be an answer he can trust? How is the answer undermined by Clara's knowledge gained via the Library excursion?

Do you think that they were scary in the episode? Do they frighten you?

Or did they mess up one of the series' most iconic villains *again*, with cheap effects and underwritten motives?

1361712088.0,107,self.gallifrey,194qi6,Why I Like The New Daleks (x-post from /r/doctorwho),131,24,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/194qi6/why_i_like_the_new_daleks_xpost_from_rdoctorwho/,"Ok. Hear me out here. I don't mean to flame anyone here, but I'd like to lay out my reasoning for why the New Paradigm Daleks are - to me - much more creepy than the RTD design.

Probably the most common complaints against the NPDs are: the colours, the profile (their seeming unsightly behinds), and their height. I'll address these, and possibly some other issues, too.
The colour: As we know, the original Dalek color scheme featured baby blue globes on a silver body. The RTD Daleks featured what could be described as a utilitarian combination of bronze shades. Being sometimes maligned as the 'Power Rangers' Daleks, the NPDs get a constant rap for their shades - something that seemed to be taken to heart by the production team by *Asylum of the Daleks*. However, to me, this makes the Daleks ever more menacing. As heavily mutated cephalopoids bent on the destruction of anything foreign to them, the Kaled mutants would have little knowledge - or care - for our human asthetic. Their designs would exist purely for functional reasons. The use of colours easily distinguishes the ranks (or, we could say 'caste system') or each Dalek. Using these colours with little regard to what a human may perceive as ""cutesy"" or ""cuddly"" makes it even more terrifying to realise that holed up inside a 'less threateningly coloured' exterior is a creature of pure hate.

Similarly, the NPDs appear less streamlined than their predecessors. If we are to assume that Daleks value function over form, then there is a clear advantage for this. We had been told early on by the production team that the posterior section would unveil new weapons, though possibly due to fan backlash to the redesign or budget we haven't seen this yet. However, this still may exist as an in-universe explanation for why the back of the NPDs is bulkier than in previous MKs.

As for the height on the wholes the NPDs appear to be more technologically advanced than their predecessors. This is only logical as they are created well after all previous MKs. If they house greater technologies within, then perhaps they need more room to fit it all. Besides, there may be side benefits to appearing taller and more menacing?

As I said, these are my reasons. I don't believe they are merely 'fanwank' explanations, as I generally find the NPDs more creepy than the RTD model now. The mysterious quality about them - less gritty, more 'space age' - terrify the child in me more than ever before.

**tl;dr Daleks don't share human asthetic, so their conception of colours is different. Daleks value function over form. New Paradigm Daleks appear more technologically advanced than RTD Daleks.**",,False,,t5_2tf29,False,,,True,t3_194qi6,http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/194qi6/why_i_like_the_new_daleks_xpost_from_rdoctorwho/,
1357931799.0,110,self.gallifrey,16e6ip,The Time of Angels and The Great Intelligence,125,15,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/16e6ip/the_time_of_angels_and_the_great_intelligence/,"In *The Time of Angels* River reads a passage from a book about the Angels which doesn't seem to have any connection to the story being told in that two-parter. However it does seem to bare some resemblance to what the Great Intelligence says in *The Snowmen*. In *The Time of Angels* it seems to be implied that the book was written by the Doctor (in the future I presume). 

First of all, here's my evidence that the Doctor is supposed to have written the book:

**The Time of Angels** 

RIVER: I found this. Definitive work on the Angels. Well, the only one. Written by a madman. It's barely readable, but I've marked a few passages. 

(The Doctor riffles through the pages of the book.) 

DOCTOR: Not bad. Bit slow in the middle. Didn't you hate his girlfriend? 

**Flesh and Stone**

OCTAVIAN: [asking about the Doctor] Doctor Song, I've lost good Clerics today. You trust this man? 

RIVER: I absolutely trust him. 

OCTAVIAN: He's not some kind of madman, then? 

RIVER: [beat] I absolutely trust him. 

I think the use of the word 'madman' is supposed to imply a connection. We also have the ""I am definitely a madman with a box"" quote a few episodes earlier in *The Eleventh Hour*.

Secondly, here's the 'out-of-place' passage that River read from ""the very end of the book"" in *The Time of Angels*.

**The Time of Angels**

RIVER: [reading from the book] What if we had ideas that could think for themselves?  What if one day our dreams no longer needed us? When these things occur and are held to be true, the time will be upon us: the time of Angels. 

**The Snowmen**

SIMEON: [possessed by The Great Intelligence] Now, the dream outlives the dreamer and can never die!

So could there be a connection here? Or am I reading too much into it? It seems like a lot of words to waste on something that has no impact on the story at hand, so it must have some relevance to something that's still to come. I don't think there is enough evidence to speculate on the specifics of what the possible connection could be yet but I wanted to share it incase anyone else could offer some insight. 

Thanks to /u/greendude33 who originally drew my attention to the River quote on [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/15vxot/spoiler_laden_oswin_thingy_thoughts_on_snow/) thread by /u/abrightmoore.

Even Dinosaurs, on a lesser extent, could have been.

Maybe not have them back to back in the season, but still.
I loved both of them, a lot, but they ended way too fast and they feet rushed in the end because so many things happen in that 45 minutes you rarely have the time to catch your breath.


I know that Moffat explicitly said that [the two parters are a waste of money and that the public doesn't like them](http://doctorwhotv.co.uk/no-two-parters-in-series-7-29062.htm), but I think the two parters make awesome stories, and the wasted potential really bugs me, especially in TPOT

A two parter could have explored more on the feelings of all the characters, or flesh out the villains more, it would have given time to fill some plot holes. It gives the opportunity for cliffhangers and to pace the story differently.

TPOT is the worst offender, because the whole episode feels like a first parter.
 That episode basically is 80% build-up, 15% montage and 5% resolution. To see such a cool idea as the Slow Invasion being wasted like that really bugged me. The villain was not fleshed enough, the resolution was WAY too short and, while being a good episode over all, I could see the potential for one of the greatest episode ever.

TATM is one of my favourite episode of Doctor Who (I've seen only the 2005 series). But, again, while liking it a lot, I saw some crack here and there. These are more choices I would have made than critique to the episode, by the way.

First, the way Rory got out of the basement. He is the last centurion, not a damsel in distress. With more time, he could have gotten out in any other way that wasn't a freaking jumpcut. 
Second, more time between Amy and River, or Rory and River. How much time did Rory and River have on screen together? I bet not that much.

Third, the moment right after the Doctor said to Rory that the old man dying was him really screamed for a cliffhanger. Even better, if maybe Rory realized that himself. 

Fourth, more time to explore the Invasion in New York. Because it was an invasion, after all. The way they portray it, every statue in New York seems to be an Angel now, even the big ones.
Or explaining why and how the Angels can now take any form or possess any statue. Case in point the freaking Statue of Liberty, while a direct application of the [Rule of Cool](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool) (warning: TvTropes), needed an explanation to make sense. To be put there just because it's cool (which it is, by the way) feels like a slap in the face. 

Dinosaurs because I wanted more dinosaurs. Everything is better with more dinosaurs.

EDIT AFTER 700 MILLISECONDS: I cut out the part where I say that I really liked both episodes, so much so that the thought that they could have been so much more annoyed me to the point of feeling the need to write a wall of text about it on reddit

So I thought I'd offer up a more light hearted post that reminds us of our favorite little moments throughout the series. References to past episodes, perhaps the way a character acted that suggested something a little extra that's easy to miss. Little things that perhaps took you a few viewings to catch.

For instance, I have two. The first one was from the recent episode The Bells of St. John when The Doctor first runs off to meet Clara. When The Doctor asks her if she remembers him, she claims she hasn't. Immediately, he takes a look at himself in the mirror, slaps his face a little, says something to her, then checks his face again. It didn't hit me until the second time I watched it, but The Doctor was making sure he hadn't regenerated in between the Christmas special and The Bells of St. John as a possible reason as to why Clara didn't recognize him.

The second one was from The Eleventh Hour. I literally watched this episode a dozen times before I caught the reference, and the fact that it took so long just blew my mind. It also made me appreciate the episode that much more, since I had watched it so many times and was still catching little things. It's the scene in which The Doctor is having his random cravings, but nothing tastes good to him. At one point, I believe right before The Doctor grabs the fish fingers and custard, little Amelia offers him carrots. The Doctor replies with something like 'Don't be ridiculous'. This was a call back to his distaste of carrots during his 6th incarnation, in which his companion constantly tried to get him to drink carrot juice.",DISCUSSION,False,,t5_2tf29,False,h,,True,t3_1btxsh,http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/1btxsh/what_are_your_favorite_little_easily_unnoticed/,

The 'me that isn't me' that John Hurt is playing is the regeneration between eight and nine, but not a Doctor as Eleven states.

I was thinking about it, what if the Eighth Doctor is on Gallifrey just as the time war is starting to brew and witnesses the death of Susan by an early invading fleet and gets mortally wounded causing The Doctor to regenerate into his next body. (Whom I will call the 'Tactician')

This next incantation addresses the high council, demanding that the Time Lords go to war for the peace of the galaxy.
The Doctor becomes Gallifreys most brilliant tactician, assisting with the war efforts.
Some time during the war, He realizes what he has become and what he turned the Time lords into. He stops assisting with the death and tries to stop the war with peace, allowing the tides to turn and the Time lords loose their advantage. 

The 'Tactician' tries to talk the Time Lords into some sort of diplomatic resolution but Rassilon has become the Time lords new leader in the time of crisis and proposes to become Gods (As we see in the End of Time). The Tactician contests against it and is attacked and mortally wounded by Rassilon. Causing him to regenerate into the Ninth, who uses the moment to end the war and escape Gallifrey.

When we see Nine in 'Rose' (I might be way off with this I haven't seen it in a bit) he is held accountable for the War by the Nestine, telling them that he 'couldn't save anyone'.

The r/gallifrey stylesheet has gone through a major overhaul. The **FAQ link** now sits at the top of the page and r/gallifrey sports a **header bar** to sort posts by date/popularity/etc. The **episode discussion** of the week has also been moved to the top of the page (you can find all past threads in the Gallifrey Wiki). Hover over text appears whenever one chooses to submit a link or self post and the colour scheme has been created. All tagged posts will appear green.

We have rewritten the **Subreddit Rules** as seen in the sidebar. The Gallifrey Wiki (also in the sidebar) will take users to more detailed explanations of Submission and Spoiler Rules. You can also find external links to other Who related websites.

**Spoiler Rules** have also been clarified. You can read full details inside the Gallifrey Wiki in the sidebar, but the short list is also in the sidebar itself. Do not put any spoilers in titles. This includes the title of the episode itself. It doesn’t matter if it came from the BBC. The spoiler policy is designed to let people peruse this subreddit in total ignorance of upcoming episodes. To let information from the BBC be posted would be to undermine the purpose of the spoiler policy.

There is a new **Report/Tag for Moderation** button. People may feel hesitant about reporting users’ posts and comments, but it is actually a very useful tool for moderators. It allows us to quickly find and address problems in the subreddit. It doesn’t get people banned or shouted at by moderators. People bring that upon themselves.

The changes you can’t see are the ones that will be enforced by us. As the new respect and courtesy paragraph in the sidebar says, personal attacks will not be tolerated and civility is to be maintained at all times. **People who violate these rules will be banned.**

We want to maintain the spirit of this subreddit: a place where people can freely express their opinions and have civil discussion. Attacks and offensive language silence people. We won’t allow this to happen.

**Downvotes** do this too. Other than removing the downvote system (which we won’t do again), we can only discourage people to not downvote others, hence the shrunken downvote arrows. All downvoted posts will also appear greyed out to the downvoter.

Downvoting is bad. It discourages discussion and it creates an unwelcoming environment. It tells people that their opinions don’t matter or aren’t wanted or aren’t legitimate or worth discussion. Don’t downvote. Don’t silence others. Write a response to them instead. And if you see a person being mass downvoted for unjust reasons, **speak up**.

Lastly, I have greatly **expanded the FAQ** section to include various frequent questions and topics regarding the Doctor. There is also a link to the original background notes for *Doctor Who*.

We welcome any **suggestions for the FAQ**. Anybody can suggest a topic, or even write the topic themselves. People who write the topic themselves will be credited in the FAQ. Comment in this thread, make your own post, or message the moderators to make a suggestion. We will take all suggestions into account excluding one: **we will not discuss canon in the FAQ**. For obvious reasons. People can read the FAQ and interpret its contents in relation to canon in whichever way they choose.

Thank you for reading this post and we hope you enjoy the changes we’ve made. Even now we are planning more improvements.

However, Clara is no ordinary girl. That leaf caused the eventuality of her birth and she is The Impossible Girl, The Woman Twice Dead. There is so much else we do not know about her other than that she died twice before. Maybe she knew this when she made her speech or was just chancing her arm and to her luck came out winning due to the leaf having more importance than even she knows. 

At this stage we don't know who she is and she could be The most important woman in all of creation (Sorry Donna), in which case it really is The Most Important Leaf In Human History. 

I think it is more due to the paradoxical fact that she exists so many times and this leaf caused her creation. She was born because this leaf brought two people together and she is impossible by nature. This leaf caused an impossible thing to happen and therefore it's psychic energy is impossible.

While I supremely hope that there is a resolution for River knowing the Doctor's name in the library and the constant, ""Doctor who? Doctor who?"", I am terrified of him naming him. 

Given Moffat's track record, the name would just be given and would be completely inconsequential to anything that would happen after that point.

Classic Who actually credited the role as 'Doctor Who' and I think part of the intrigue of the show has been that little bit of mystery. As much as I want this (going on three series) story arc to be compelling and satisfying, I think the show will lose some of it's magic if he actually names him. 

**TL;DR**- If Moffat names The Doctor, we will lose something, not gain. Am I wrong?

1357117401.0,105,self.gallifrey,15th09,"The Doctor and Power - Very long post, controversy",125,20,88,http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/15th09/the_doctor_and_power_very_long_post_controversy/,"I was reading a chapter in *Chicks Unravel Time* about the power dynamics in series 3 of the new series. This chapter ""Maids and Masters"" argues that one of the most attractive qualities of the Doctor is his power. Rose decides to go with the Doctor because he mentions his ability to travel in time.

It's the Doctor's power that allows him to travel through time and space and show people new worlds and his ability to change events throughout history, topple empires and save planets. He can't even truly die and he can read minds.

The chapter brings up the often unaddressed topic of power in relation to the Doctor's companions. They are always inferior to him. Companions don't like to admit it (like when Rose states she isn't his ""assistant"" in School Reunion) but there's no denying it. No matter how assertive and loud -mouthed (Donna) they are, the power is always in the Doctor's hands and he's not afraid to use it.

He stole Donna's memory despite her clear no, he disabled Jack's ability to time travel, he destroyed Harriet Jones's job in six words. He trapped a little girl inside a mirror. But it's series 3 that this chapter focuses on.

Martha and the Doctor. Martha is in a way, the companion with the most power in her own life- she's a doctor, she comes from an affluent family, she joins UNIT when she leaves the Doctor, *she* chooses when she leaves the Doctor which rarely happens.

But Martha is often at a disadvantage and the Doctor fails to acknowledge the difference in power between them (I think he fails to notice Martha much at all really). Like in the Shakespeare Code when Martha reminds the Doctor that she can't exactly walk through the past without trouble.

**Martha**: Oh, but hold on. Am I all right? I'm not going to get carted off as a slave, am I?

**The Doctor**: Why would they do that?

**Martha**: Not exactly white, in case you haven't noticed.

**The Doctor**: I'm not even human. Just walk about like you own the place. Works for me.

This right here shows the way in which the Doctor totally misses the point. The power difference between the two of them is a big issue. The Doctor really could walk around like he owns the place, Martha couldn't. And Martha doesn't have the advantage of 900 years of experience, a screwdriver, or knowledge to pilot a TARDIS to get herself out of a jam like he does. No companion has all that really.

The chapter goes on to talk about the Master/Lucy relationship and how it's basically what goes wrong when a Time Lord takes advantage of this power difference. Lucy is seen with a bruised eye and a limp, she's dressed in a low cut red satin dress obviously chosen by the Master and her empty eyes reveal her emotionally drained state. We know where that one's going...

The book also talks about the Master/Doctor relationship and how the Master drains 10 and treats him like a dog with a bowl that even reads ""dog"" outside of his tent. He totally humiliates him. Which is pretty much what 10 wanted to do with the Master- keep him like a pet in the TARDIS. The two of them are in this constant power play that frankly can easily be looked at sexually (it's even in the classic series) even if I don't ship those two.

Though it's clear both of them want to have relationships with their companions, the Doctor doesn't take advantage of his companions like the Master did but we get a window into what it could look like.

And even though the Doctor wouldn't do that kind of thing it's an issue. It's like when your teachers or parents (this is the books' analogy) tell you to treat them as friends. But obviously that can't work out because they are the ones who grant you your grades and allowance and privileges. What if you accidentally mention when you went partying with your friends? But at the same time you can't refuse their friendship. It's a tricky thing. The same way, the Doctor always has the power to control where the companion goes.

Joan Redfern knew this and it's one reason why she wouldn't go with 10. She tells him, ""But that's not fair. What must I look like to you, Doctor? I must seem so very small."" Redfern knows she can never be his equal; they can't have a romantic relationship like that, assuming she ever came to love him. Joan is perceptive and realizes the imbalance of power. This is also one reason why I've found 10's statement to Wilf about humans looking like giants to be disingenuous (and 10 ignoring the power dynamics again).

This doesn't mean the Doctor is evil or anything. He's a good guy, he wants to be equals with his companions. But glossing over the imbalance can be dangerous (just like denying ads' power of you is). Series 3 is cool because it addresses this stuff. With great power comes great responsibility. As the book says, ""Don't ignore how that affects your relationship with humans. Don't use it to manipulate and exploit others,"" (127).

The Doctor does just that in Waters of Mars and even has that problem again with the TLs in End of Time. Nothing changes when we get into *The Eleventh Hour* either. ""We're encouraged to see Amelia and the eleventh Doctor as the same - adventurous and childlike - rather than what they actually are: a small and vulnerable child and a powerful alien,"" (128).

This chapter about exploring the power distribution between the Doctor and other characters really interested me. It also reminds me (and is mentioned in the book) that this issue would be addressed should the Doctor ever regenerate into anything other than an able, young, white, cisgendered male. Obviously he wouldn't be walking through human history as easily anymore. Why haven't we had a female Doctor or Doctor of color? If the Doctor lost some of the power he owns by belonging to any of those categories would he also lose appeal for fans?

I found this extremely interesting and I'd love with all my hearts to hear other peoples' thoughts. But please, let's focus on the power dynamics and leave out the what-if discussions and continuity arguments regarding possible regenerations.",,False,,t5_2tf29,1357117792.0,,,True,t3_15th09,http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/15th09/the_doctor_and_power_very_long_post_controversy/,

However, I recently rewatched it and liked it a lot more, I thought it was much more subtly written than it appears to be on the surface. I'll explain my ideas in the forthcoming wall of text. Thanks in advance if you read all of this theory.

To start off, I don't think this episode is really about Amy and Rory at all, that's just the story on the surface. I feel like what makes this episode really really great is that it gives such subtle insights into the doctor and that's the main point of this story. I didn't catch most of this the first time through because I didn't know who the dream lord was, but once that's been revealed I think there's a lot more to catch on subsequent viewings.

To start off, one of the first pieces of dialogue in the episode goes along the lines of Amy saying ""Doctor what are you doing visiting us?"" and the Doctor replying ""Well you know me, I always like to stop by and visit old companions"" which just isn't true. I think this is the first big clue that the scene takes place within a dream and while this particular scene is in the dream that's hinted at being more what Rory wants for Amy than what the Doctor wants (Amy later chooses between the two worlds/men), I think this line of dialogue shows that the Doctor really wants to see his companions well off and would like to be the type of person who goes back to just visit his old companions, but that's not who he is. Meaning, that this world isn't just ideal for Amy and Rory, it's ideal for the Doctor too.

I really like the dream lord, too. I feel like in the scenes where the dream lord pops up and it's just the doctor and the dream lord, we get a look at inside the doctor's head. The dream lord is like a little voice in the back of his head, always questioning himself and hating himself. I feel like this is the way the doctor always thinks or the way he thinks during a lot of his adventures, but this episode is the only time we really see it.

Obviously the dream lord shows how much the Doctor hates himself (I mean they straight up say it in the episode) but the last piece that I think is really interesting about the episode is that the biggest verbal blow to the doctor over the course of the episode doesn't come from the dream lord (doesn't come from the doctor himself) but from Amy right after Rory dies when the Doctor says he can't do anything to save him and Amy replies ""Then what is the point of you?"" I thought it was a pretty brutal thing to say to somebody. Not entirely sure what I think that means in terms of the whole episode but it's interesting to me.

It's hard for me to put everything into words. I haven't covered everything here because I can't think of every little point I thought of, but I think this is the important part.

Anyways, I'm just interested to hear what other people think about this episode. It gets discussed a lot, but it's interesting to me and has become my favorite episode recently. I'm doing a complete rewatch of matt smith's run since he's regenerating and this episode really stuck with me. I'm interested to compare it Nightmare in Silver but haven't gotten there yet (I'm in the middle of series 6)

Right. So Clara = Roses.

ALSO

The Doctor's granddaughter's real name translates to Rose. And I don't need to even mention the other Rose, love her or hate her we can all agree on the fact that she was and is very precious and loved by the Doctor. Also, there are some parallels between her and Rose.

Is she a figment of his subconscious? Is Moffat screwing with our heads? He knows that of course we are going to draw the parallels between a rose and the Rose. Why a rose? What is he playing at? Here is all the evidence.

This has one downside: we'd have a ""I'm the doctor"" moment every episode. So I think this story arch would then be condensed to the next half of season 7, ending with him finally saving the companion and traveling with the one he saved.

There is a moment (around :38) where River looks up from a book and says ""it's called marriage, honey"" and it just brought back to me how much I really don't like this story line.


I think the CHARACTER of River Song is cool - and would have made a really fun companion, sort of like a girl Indiana Jones companion - lots of adventures to be had!   And when she first appeared in the Library, I was intrigued by her, and the emotional connection that eventually linked Ten to her was really palpable in that episode, so I was willing to believe that there might be such a woman in his future (though I was skeptical that he would ever actually marry out of love because in +/- 900 yrs, he only came close to that what, two, maybe 3 times and never actually tied the knot?).  


But every story line that has included her has just not convinced me at all that there is a deep connection between The Doctor and her beyond her own adventurous imaginings.  She is as much of a groupie as Amy or Martha and I just sense no true chemistry between the two of them in a way that makes me want the Doctor to be married at all.  (I felt more chemistry between the Doctor and JACK!)  By S6, I was just bored by the whole thing and felt like the side story that was taking over the whole plot line was so weak and I just disliked it.  


I guess after seeing the trailer, I am worried that now that they're coming back, there's going to be all this ridiculous ""marriage"" stuff (like with her being bossy and him completely without that emotional connection that appeared in the Library) and I just want there to be Doctor Adventure.  As a Lady Whovian, I am as much enthralled with the romance of the Doctor as anyone - but I really love the Doctor for so much more than just that -- the adventure, the scope of emotion, the learning of wisdom, the discovery -- all that just feels dull within the River-Marries-the-Doctor story line.

First I want to bring attention to just how young Piper was when she took the role, and how her and Eccleston managed to hit it off immediately. It's not easy to take such a major role, let alone act it so believably, but in many ways Rose managed to make believability a strength in her performance. At no point did I feel that Rose wasn't a real ordinary person and a lot of that came from Piper.

Her chemistry with Eccleston was superb. They would banter and share a laugh over chips and do that weird three person ""into the future!"" fist pump thing. They would dance and look at both death and life together. The two just clicked exceedingly well and it really helped to sell Doctor Who coming back.

And then we move into the second season, a particularly weak one that was rife with episodes that most would much rather forget than repeat. Now this was due to a lot of things, but it isn't helped by the fact that a major element of the show (the Doctor and Rose dynamic) had fundamentally changed.

Is Doctor Who overdoing it with catchphrases?",123,24,72,http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/y58zt/timeywimey_xs_are_cool_hello_sweetie_come_along/,"A recent trend in New Who is a penchant for ""lines"".

Not just lines of dialogue but soundbites of quotable nuggets that get regurgitated over and over. Unlike the sparsely used (and notably versitile) ""Fantastic!"" of Eccleston's run or the self aware should-I-start-saying ""Allons-y"" of Tennant's Moffat in particular has a notable tendency to perpetuate these memetic phrases.

I'll first take note of ""wibbly-wobbly timey wimey"". Initially the flub of an explanation that ""got away from"" the Doctor in Blink it was later reused in Time Crash, this time used as if the phrase itself was some sort of inside reference in-continuity, with Ten expecting a high-five from Five (heh) while saying it (ignore the fact that Five would have no clue what the phrase means, but says it in unison with him anyway.

The phrase later resurfaces again in The Eleventh Hour, this time as a quick chant by Eleven (that frankly comes out off nowhere). It's pretty important to note that despite the phrase having been used three times in the show now there is only one writer repeating it: Moffat.(Unlike the previous catchphrases which were indeed used by multiple writers).

It's actually a bit sad. It's like he's trying to make ""fetch"" happen.

Anywho apparently he did get it to happen because we see it transform into the fairly nonsensical ""spacey wacey"" in The Doctor's Wife then again as ""timey wimey"" in The Girl Who Waited. Then finally as... dear god, I hate saying this... the completely asinine ""**humany woomany**"" from The Doctor, the Widow and the Wardrobe.

But why does the show do this? There are far more tiny ones that crop up (""penny in the air"", ""eyes front, soldier"", etc.) that take a line and repeat it. Why?

Ultimately this factors into the trend of Moffat's run. Many mistake him for being a ""bad showrunner"" and in many ways he does slip, but the reason for this isn't sudden onset incompetence. It's playing it safe.

Catchphrases are inherently easy  to write. Hell, it's already written for you! Most are shoehorned or otherwise forced in just to piggyback on some form of nostalgia for past episodes and creates cheap continuity without commitment, creates the illusion of a character without exploration. Like most 80's children's cartoons, catchphrases are a cheap and easy way to have characters memorable and seemingly unique.

But I want to hear the other side. Doctor Who's been no stranger to catchhrases (would you like a jelly baby while I reverse the polarity of the neutron flow?) and they can be used properly in the right context and with moderation. Ultimately, what are your thoughts?

**EDIT**: I also want to make it clear that catchphases themselves, however numerous, are not always a bad thing. This is television and some characters have a go-to phrase that makes them memorable. What I'm really noticing is how a great deal of these catchphrases don't fit naturally with the story and even in-context serve little to no real purpose and ultimately only distract from the story.",,False,,t5_2tf29,1344869570.0,,,True,t3_y58zt,http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/y58zt/timeywimey_xs_are_cool_hello_sweetie_come_along/,

What if they had parallel Doctor Who's going.  One Show dedicated to the 12th Doctor and his adventures keeping the name Doctor Who and doing what it does best.

But they had another show, either airing in the off season, or as a companion series staring Paul McGann giving him a proper season and displays the events leading up to his Regeneration in the Hurt Doctor, and this show giving a different name, something like just The Doctor, or a subtitle Doctor Who: The Lost Doctor.

It wouldn't have to keep airing, even just a season or half season, but something to give viewers who are not familiar with the Big Finish productions an idea to get to know the 8th Doctor.

They can even be smart about it, and events in this secondary series could be catalysts that trigger events in the 2005 series that we've seen.

Every episode or two, the Doctor goes through a violent regeneration into a new body and personality, each being an aspect of the personality of the final body he takes as his permanent next incarnation. 

For me, I'd definitely choose a strongly pacifist Doctor in a war situation. Many of the Doctor's incarnations have attempted to be as peaceful as possible (the best examples have been Five, Ten and Eleven). I'd have him be extremely bright, but not willing to be manipulative like Two, Four, or Seven. His outfit would be reserved and he'd be more philosophical and curious like One, Four, and Eight. I'd put this transient incarnation in the middle of an endless war (like we see in Destiny of the Daleks) and make him struggle with the inevitable conclusion that he must help one side defeat the other. The episode would be more about the Doctor dealing his own existential issues than the war itself. 

EDIT: It could even be a two-parter. As he finally comes to terms with his decision, he goes through another regeneration. This one one is cold and shows no empathy. Manipulative like Seven, a solider like Nine, and arrogance like Three and Four. He's the perfect Doctor to lead them into war. However, as his side is about to reach victory, we realize he was never on their side in the first place - he has just caused the mutual destruction of both sides.

So...In this episode, we learn much more of Clara than many people are willing to see. In the opening scenes, we see the theme revolving around this particular episode - which I'll come to in a moment, but I believe that Rings of AKhaten will be one of the few episodes that I'll look back at since the re-launch of Doctor Who as a global superstar and view as some of the best writing. In fact, between you and the few thousand readers of /r/doctorwho and /r/gallifrey, I'm a big enough man to admit that Neil Cross is one of the few writers in television today that has constantly managed to enthral, delight, and in this case, cry like a little baby at the beauty and simplicity of the story.

Seriously. Between Neil Cross and Neil Gaiman, if they ever got together and collaborated, I think I'd find myself in front of a product that would be revelatory to nothing less than the entire human condition. (Yes, I genuinely believe that Gaiman is *that important* as a writer in the late 20th/ early 21st century, and if you haven't read neverwhere or American Gods by now, you bloody well should have. In fact I'll wait right here while you go into town and by them both, or download them to your e-reader.)

But I digress. The undertones of this show are wonderful; they're written by a person who has a wonderful grasp on the concept of Causality and synchronicity; in the opening scenes, we're introduced to page one - the story behind a leaf, that, as Clara's father explains, had to grow in that precise space, to be blown off of the tree at that particular point in space and time to give birth to this entire future whereby two people fall in love, and give birth to the new companion - Clara. It establishes the caring, nurturing environment in which Clara grows, and establishes a vital difference between herself and the former companion of Amy.



**The past: Where we've been.**

Amy, for example, is a companion that I never felt had any real sense of wonder; very British in a very typical way, as she seemed to be very underwhelmed by many of the things she saw - she filled a role in the Doctor's life though, and provided something that he very much needed at this point in life - someone matriarchal, bullish and take charge, who didn't appear to be afraid to Scold the doctor like a naughty schoolboy when she felt he was getting out of hand. I recall a few points, particular during the lucid moments of the insanity that *is* the Tenant era where RTD and Moffat have written it into their scripts *in a very specific way* that the regeneration process, at least in part is guided very much by the life experiences of the previous incarnations. 9 was  guided by the grief of having freshly escaped from the ravages of the much talked about, but never completely shown time war. 10 was guided by necessity, and a need to cope with the grief of having lost not just a few people, but *any* people in his life that may have, will have and ever did hold any importance to him. We glean from the End of Time parts one and time that he's in the final moments of acceptance, and this culminates in a scheme for the return of Rassilon, the redemption of the Master, and release from any grief that he may have held over the time war. Despite the Daleks tenacity, the return of Rassilon strengthen's 10's resolve that he did in fact *do the right thing*... In condemning his own species to exist outside of space and time, he did the one thing he's always done and continually be relied upon to do. To meddle, and to act in the greater good.

This, incidentally is always why, in the back of my head, I've always always considered the strong possibility that the Doctor is ""the other"" - that third aspect of the Timelord society that was responsible for the enlightenment and subsequent birth of Gallifreyan society into the race of Gallifreyans, and the society of Timelords...But I'll tell you all about that some other time. Once again, I digress.



**The Present: Where we are, and where we're going.**

The point is, that 11 is something different. 11 is a reflection of the passions of Stephen Moffat and the people he has on the writing staff. The 11th regeneration is a choice influenced by the choice to remember the *best* of himself, and indeed of Gallifreyan and Timelord society. I'm actually again, fairly convinced you saw the seed of this during the children in need special that Moffat wrote a couple of years ago, where we're treated to a five minute dialogue of David Tennant and Peter Davidson conversing, and remembering quite fondly the past, and how the past influences the future. Isn't that a lesson we should all learn and remember? That what we do in the present matters every bit as much as the past, because it dictates what happens in the future? Matt Smith represents rebirth, and absorbs many aspects of the previous incarnations - the childlike wonder of 2, the stern and cockiness of 3, the curiosity of 4...These are all examples of things I *personally* see, but...I'm often reintroduced to Many of the doctors with every episode I watch.

Even in the title sequences that have been introduced this year, we see not only nostalgia, but a love for themes of the older episodes of Doctor Who - I believe this is Stephen Moffat's way of telling us that the past has not, and will not be forgotten under his watch.

And looping back into the point about the companions, this is why I believe Clara has been introduced; whereas Amy reins him in and treats him like a child in many ways, Clara actively *encourages* him to run - this is actually the crux of the thread for her storyline. Clara, I believe will nurture and comfort, and encourage him to once again find his feet in the universe. In letting go of page one, Clara is demonstrating a resonating theme through all the 7 series of the new who era - that despite all those moments when he feels like he's let his companions down and *feels* like he's alone, he never truly will be. The long loved, and sorely missed Elizabeth Sladen demonstrated perfectly that he will *always* have a home, *always* be loved, and will never be forgotten. Even if the worst should come to pass - and it's interesting, because I see more than a little of Sarah-Jane in Clara.

The rings of Akhaten is very important in this respect; you have a wonderful piece of dialogue that made me cry more than a little, as you see Matt Smith letting go of over a thousand years of grief to feed this beast in front of him. I actually think this moment is a wonderful metaphor, and the moment that we've probably been waiting for since Christopher Eccleston closed the doors on the series. This is Matt Smith monologuing not just to the demon in front of him, but the demon *within him*, finally letting go of all of the grief and sorrow that has held him back, and acknowledging that it's time to move forward. To run. We even see, for the first time, the Doctor starting to acknowledge his history again, by dropping the revelation to Clara of the existence of his Grand-daughter, Susan. I had *actually* briefly considered that Clara could be a regeneration of her, but I disregarded that almost immediately. I look forward to Stephen Moffat's explanation though.

This, if anything, is the second great lesson of the second half of season 7: It never does to hold on to grief an sorrow for too long. It can sour the soul, and turn grief into madness, which, with a man that can travel in time and space and do *pretty much* anything, is no good combination. In series 7, I believe that as the question will be answered, so will the final vestiges of his scarred psyche be healed, allowing him to truly move past his limitations and become more than even he thought he was capable...For good or ill.


**So where is this all heading?**

I personally believe that this may well culminate in one of two possibilities; the doctor facing his demons of the last great time war, or, keeping up with the themes of rebirth, will see 11 fall through all of space and time, and in his closing days, meet Rassilon and Omega once more, and re-form the ancient society of Time lords, by going back to a point *before* Gallifrey was consumed by the void, and hoping that by surrendering himself to the loom, will present the possibility of a divergent timeline whereby the Great time war can be actively awarded, and the Gallifreyan race redeemed much in the way that the master was.

Either way, I'm positive that with the more than competent staff in Cardiff, the 50th anniversary episode will make me laugh, cry, and reminisce about all of those times as a child that I would sit on my grandfather's lap, and cuddle into him as I witnessed Jon Pertwee and Tom Baker save the world once more from the multitude of evil that lies out there.

Some are good, some are okay, and some are fandamntastic. Today I was reading the EDA novel Vampire Science and noticed a couple of things. First was how the Doctor introduced himself to another character in the novel: ""'I'm a Time Lord,' said the Doctor. 'From the planet Gallifrey in the constellation of Kasterborous.' 'Moreover,' said the Doctor, 'I'm a former President of the High Council of the Time Lords, Keeper of the Legacy of Rassilon, Defender of the Laws of Time and Protector of Gallifrey. I'm called the Bringer of Darkness, the Oncoming Storm, and the Evergreen Man.'"" That sounds so similar to the introduction the Doctor gives his fellow passengers on the Titanic in Voyage of the Damned. Second of all was a confrontation between the Doctor and UNIT's General Adrienne Kramer. She was calling him out for manipulating his companions for their own good, and for endangering them because they all wanted to impress him. Sound familiar? It should. We hear Rory and later River giving him almost the exact same speech. The themes that we're seeing explored now in New Who have been brought up before, and it's wonderful. Heck, the new character, Kate Stewart, is from one of the novels.

It made me realize that most of the people who have worked or are working on Doctor Who now, R.T. Davies, Stephen Moffat, Nicholas Briggs, David Tennant, probably a lot of others too, they were fans during the dark years when the show was off the air. When no one was making Doctor Who except fans. And those people, they did in the late 90s what we're all doing now. They got on their message boards and they shared their fan theories, and they obsessively read the books that kept the show alive, they wrote their own books, filmed their own fan movies.

I know that some of us prefer the emotional connection of Davies stories. Some of us niche players prefer Nicholas Briggs' descent into madness and darkness in the Big Finish stories. And some of us prefer Moffat's timey wimey craziness, but Doctor Who is really, REALLY big. It's probably the biggest coherent story telling feat that we've got on the planet. Star Trek comes close in scope, but there isn't a lot else. Not really. I mean, Harry Potter is seven books. Seven pretty good books, but that's it. The Whoniverse is big enough to get lost in. Big enough to stake out your own corner and claim that it's better than all the other corners. But we shouldn't be doing that. We should be celebrating how awesome the whole is, and how lucky, how truly lucky we all are to be along for the ride. Maybe Moffat's created a character you just can't stand. Maybe R.T. Davies created a character or two you just can't stand. Maybe David Tennant haunts your dreams and you just can't stop wishing he would come back. But they're all bits and facets in this wonderful, awesome world we're so privileged to share in.

We're in good hands folks. These people loved the show as much as we do. Nobody is ruining Doctor Who. They loved it so much they freaking brought it back from the dead. We all have different tastes, and none of us are going to get everything we want, every season. I just hope we can stop all the fan hate and the nerd rage and actually enjoy the damn show.

I'll close with a quote from the acknowledgements section of the book I just finished: ""And finally, a hearty thank-you to Phil Segal and everyone else who helped make the telemovie – you folks gave us all these neat new pieces to play with in the greatest Lego set ever invented."" That's what these stories, characters and arcs are: neat new pieces in the greatest Lego set ever invented. EVER.

My theory is he just saw the cult again, and he is freshly doused in a pit of grief. He is very obviously thinking of the last encounter he had with them, and what happened there.

A few months ago, I came here ranting about the Moffat run. At that time, I've only started on S5. At the recommendation of the redditors here, I took a break, and watched Moffat with fresh eyes (not coming from RTD era).

Still disappointed. The pacing was off, the writing wasn't as sharp, and oh my god, plot holes that were made just in the sake of looking cool. WTF is up with so many paradoxes. So I took one of the most often repeated things that people say here: that Moffat returned DW to its classic roots.

So I watched all the classics that are available. Totally enjoyed it. And while I got the feeling that 11's stories have undergone a similar slump to 4's (the first few Colin Baker episodes were meh), there are really really essential DW things that persisted all throughout the series that Moffat changed. I vehemently disagree that Moffat's run is more akin to Classic Who. If anything, it's drastically more different. Here are my observations:

1) Moffat's writing for DW seems to me like it caters more to an American audience. The tropes used, the humor, the exchange of lines--it's less British that it used to be. But the Doctor's a Time Lord, not a Brit, you say. Sure, but decades of writing hinged on silly, witty, subtle British humor is replaced by the rather overt and superficial Hollywood comedy. It's kind of disappointing. And it seems like Moffat is pandering to a wider pop audience.

2) Moffat's run has less camp, and more superficial ""complexity."" Classic Who was incredibly campy. And that's what made it work. When things got rough and dark, that campiness made it rougher and darker because of the contrast. RTD used this to great effect (although he usually made it so grand and the solution INCREDIBLY CAMPY that it sometimes made you go WAT.) Moffat seems to have gotten rid of that delicious campiness and made this into a dark, albeit humorous tale of a mad man in a box. DW, from the Classic to the RTD era, is about a humorous tale of a mad man in a box, albeit with a dark undertone. The difference is that drama and complexity are NOT what the Classic and RTD era was hinged on. It was hinged on FUN, but in the course of that fun we encounter fantastic problems.

3) In relation to campiness, Classic Who accepts its suckiness, which is why it's so great. There are no pretensions of being cool, Classic Who just wants to tell a story, whether that story looks or sounds cool or not. Moffat's run seems to be concerned with making everything cool--cool enemies, cool people, cool story arcs--that it seems like they're trying so hard. Sure, you can say that RTD tried to made everything GRAND--but we're talking about scale here.

The way I see it, RTD took Classic Who and made everything larger, but in essence the same.

Moffat took Classic Who and thought of ways how it could look cool. Think of someone taking a classic car and pimping the hell out of it, with spoilers and decals and stuff, eventually making that car not have the original's essence at all.

The recent Christmas special though--that one's a bit good. I wish I could have skipped the whole Pond arc with the abysmal pacing and the stupid exploding TARDIS and all of those insane plot holes, and instead started 11 with Oswin and Strax. :P",,False,,t5_2tf29,False,,,True,t3_17lxev,http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/17lxev/i_dont_get_why_people_say_moffat_brought_doctor/,

###The Seemingly Exponential Growth of this Community


When I first discovered this subreddit 6 or 7 months ago, it was still a fairly new community and had not even reached 3000 subscribers. Despite it's small size, there was never a lack of interesting discussion, and it quickly became my favorite and most visited subreddit. I was obviously not the only one that fell in love with this community, and since my first visit, the subscriber base has more than tripled in size and is quickly approaching the quintuple digits. On one hand, this is a great thing. A discussion based community thrives when more opinions are thrown into the melting pot. Because of this influx of new redditors, /r/gallifrey has become a place with a wealth of different insights and perspectives, and has become a much more active community. On the other hand, this creates a few issues that we must learn to deal with. I am always excited to add new people to this great community, however, in some cases, more people means more problems.    
   
I apologize in advance for this annoying list of grievances. 


###The Hive Mind and the Circle Jerk
   
Yes, us redditors are no strangers to the incessant complaining about the ""hive mind"" and ""circle jerking"", but unfortunately, these phenomena are very real. I see many of the same ideas rehashed over and over in the top comments and it can become a chore to search through them for new insights. One example of this that I recently saw was in the ""Least favorite major villain thread"". Not only was the top comment about Slitheen, but also at least half a dozen other highly voted comments were about them! I don't even see them as major antagonists! This is not the best example, but this is just one of many instances I have seen recently.   
  
We can counter the influence of the hive mind by using the down vote button sparingly and using the up vote button liberally. Don't just up vote posts that you agree with, but up vote posts that are well written and interesting. Think about it, do you really want to read a flood of posts that all agree exactly with your views? It is far more interesting and engaging to read things that you never would have thought of yourself.     
  

###Factual Questions  
  
Opinion based questions, even some as general as ""What is your favorite episode"" etc, are welcome, in my mind, because new people can bring different ideas to the table. Questions regarding factual information, however, should not be asked multiple times. Regeneration limits, for example, is a topic that has been asked about countless times on this subreddit, and the answer is a simple search away (either by searching this subreddit or checking Tardis Wiki. Hint: it's 12).   
I don't mean to say that all inquiries about facts and trivia are useless, as many obscure questions can be quite interesting. Just try to do a quick search to see if it's been posted before.  

  
###Let's be Nice to Each Other

I'm sure many of you have seen Loki's recent post about the importance of canon and the heated argument it instigated. I always enjoy reading Loki's posts and having the occasional chat with her and I was very disappointed to see the way in which vulgar language was used against her. I rarely see that kind of discourse in this community, and it was disheartening to see.    
  
Arguments are valuable. They are the very basis of a discussion based community. Conflicting opinions, however, should always be respected and dealt with in a civil manner.   
  

   

        
While instances of these things are still relative rare, they are becoming more and more frequent. Let's try to nip this at the bud and keep our community fresh, engaging, and accepting. 
  
  
As a side note, while I rarely find myself disagreeing with LokianEule, I do not completely agree with her about canon. I have already wasted my time rambling on about this however, and I have to start studying for finals... so I'll save my thoughts on canon for a future post.

A lot of complaints seem to center around her romantic interest in the Doctor and her inability to let go of those romantic feelings (something that the Doctor doesn't help by being flirty and misleading on a number of occasions).  So  I figured where better to speak out in Martha's defense and start a conversation then /r/gallifrey? Here we go:

I'm one of those fans that likes just about everything and every part of the show (started with New Who and it's the basis of my obsession but I've seen a fair amount of classic and liked a lot of it and I'm in love with 8's audios) and just about all the eras/companions etc.  That in mind I subscribe to many of the same complaints about Rose that others here have.  I mostly like her but she wasn't exactly great at being a companion.  Her romance with the Doctor was a little too prominent, she wasn't very skilled or talented and she often came off as a bit childish.  

Martha was a great replacement.  She's a med student, a woman of action and incredibly smart.  I just rewatched Smith &amp; Jones (underrated episode) and her enthusiasm and embracing of the adventure is great.  As is her resourcefulness and quick thinking. 

As her season goes on (and it has some of my favorite episodes *Gridlock*, *Human Nature/Family of Blood*, *Blink*, *Utopia*) many claim she gets whinier and fault her for being in love with the Doctor.  Let's get real people. An attractive man falls from the sky being a charming kickass space wizard and literally sweeps her off her feet and gives her access to all of space and time.  In their very first meeting he kisses her (as part of his solution to the moon situation) and then comes back to take her on a trip.  She has every reason to develop feelings for him.  It's a realistic story beat and the more time she spends in close proximity with the Doctor the more those feelings develop.  Can you argue that fresh off the Rose romance this was the wrong kind of character arc to introduce and perhaps a Donna type companion would have been better?  Sure.  But that doesn't make Martha a bad character.  She's a really enjoyable one whose intelligence and competence are a welcome change from 9 and 10's time with Rose.  Martha is much more pro-active and action oriented and it's one of the reasons season 3 is where New Who really takes off (don't get me wrong, there was a lot to love in seasons 1 and 2). Her decision to leave the Tardis is based on her unrequited feelings and it's a nice character beat that shows that she's a strong woman who doesn't want to be defined by loving a man that doesn't love her in return.

Her season 4 episodes are great too.  She thrives after the Doctor becoming a vital member of UNIT and bringing a lot of the Doctor's philosophies with her.  She even delivers one of my favorite companion moments in *The Doctor's Daughter*.  (""I'm doctor Martha Jones, who the hell are you?)  Then by the finale she's prepared to pull the trigger on Earth (agree or disagree this takes a lot of conviction) to end everyone's suffering at the hand's of the Daleks.  

All in all she's a well rounded character who brought welcome change to an early era of New Who and I feel like she deserves more credit than she gets.  Agree? Disagree?  Wanna punch my nose?

How it will be avoided remains to be seen.

**Is the Valeyard a direct incarnation of the Doctor?**

It depends on whose canon you're going off of. According to script editor Saward and writer Holmes, absolutely canonically yes. According to producer Nathan-Turner, no. When writing Trial of a Time Lord, N-T forced Saward to change the Master's line from naming the Valeyard ""the penultimate incarnation"" to ""an amalgamation"" ([source](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/The_Valeyard#Behind_the_scenes)). The former appears in the novelization, but the decision was *explicitly* made to not call the Valeyard a regeneration of the Doctor.

I have read some theories as to why change would be horrible for the show. However, honestly.. I feel change is in order. Yes, RTD build the new Doctor Who without Gallifrey, and had essentially killed the Time Lords. And honestly, that was a wonderful way to bring back The Doctor.

I am pretty new to Doctor Who (just been watching for the past year or so) have only really seen New Who episodes, but am fascinated with the lore of Classic Who and how it all ties together. I have been mulling over a Clara theory since just before 7B started, and its evolved a bit since then, and have been wondering what others might think here (really been enjoying reading this communities theories, responses, and knowledge of Who lore). So lets get to it!






**Clara and the Second Doctor:**

First, I gotta say. Clara is a normal girl. I think Moffat has made sure to tell us enough now, that the companion Clara we have been watching is exactly that. Time and time again in 7b, this is being stated and restated, and each time the Doctor accepts it, doesn't understand it, and keeps searching for his answer.

Now, if this Clara is a normal girl, why does she keep re-appearing through time? I will get to that answer, but first I gotta give some explanation of what I think Clara is as a character (a theory of the writer's perspective) and why that character is relevant.

We know this 7b season is full of Classic Who references and shout-outs due to the 50th anniversary coming. But one Doctor in particular seems interesting here. The Second.

I haven't watched almost any Classic Who, so hopefully Who Scholars here can give some more weight to this, but lets look at 7b and the Second Doctor.

I recently watched the Doctor's Revisited about the Second Doctor. We can see the influence on Matt Smith's (and Tennant's) Doctors, as well as it being stated that the Second is Matt's biggest inspiration for his Doctor.

Well I noticed a couple things (and one part that I think brings this all together). First, we can see a few of the monster this half season come from the era of the Second Doctor. The Ice Warriors and the upcoming Cybermen both debuted during the Second Doctor's run, but even more importantly so did the Great Intelligence (I will get to why I think this is possibly even more important in Clara's story). These are only known ""Classic"" villains I can think of during 7b, and it seems possibly deliberate, especially when we look at the two companions they highlighted in the special...

The Second Doctor's two female companions that were talked about in the special were Victoria and Zoe. Who are these two characters? Well Victoria is a girl from Victorian times, and Zoe is a technological genius from the future. It seems no mistake that the ""other"" two ""Claras"" we meet are... a Victorian girl and a technological genius from the future... Hell, if you combined Victoria and Zoe the result would even look like Clara.

Now I think the comparison to those past companions is not to say Clara has any in-show relation or connection to them. Just that this half-season is a love letter to the Second Doctor, and we need to keep the Second in mind when thinking of the explanations and villains.

There could be theories connecting it all with Jenna's statement of ""meeting the doctor more than 3 times"". But I don't have enough to connect her to anything else for certain, and will leave that for a reveal of what that means and how. I think its more related to what will happen with Clara's character, and not what we have already seen, but it is possible to connect her to the past in many ways (the ""Second Doctor"" theory, could do it, but I am not currently using it for that reason).

Well now that we have that: ""Clara is a normal girl"" (for now) and ""7b is a love letter to the Second Doctor"", lets look at what we can assume is the ""main villain"" this season, and how he ties into it all... The Great Intelligence
  
  
  
    
    
    
**The Doctor, the Godslayer:**




After I learned that the Great Intelligence was from Classic Who shortly after The Snowmen, I had to do some wiki digging. I was fascinated by the concept of the GI being a [Great Old One](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Great_Old_One) and how that ties into the who universe.

These Great Old Ones were once similar to the Time Lords of their universe, and when it died and they entered ours, they became like gods (with a borrowed Lovecraftian mythos, which adds to the intrigue). I really first thought that the GI would play into a larger part of the Doctor versus the gods this season, especially after the Rings of Akhaten (which I thoroughly enjoyed seeing him fight another, similar or related monster/god, but the rest of the episodes didn't seem to support this season focusing on the ""gods"" much more).

What is truly great about these characters, is what we can see in the Doctor's speech to Akhaten. A concept brought up in God Complex. That the Doctor himself can sometimes be like a god, and his own desires are influencing his companions, civilizations, an the entire universe at times. It leaves a great question of ""What could the Doctor become, in his own hubris, if given the same power as The Great Old ones?""

(I have further speculation of the future of Who with that, but its pure fan thoughts on the nature of the Doctor, and what could be done with it, which I will elaborate on in another post to r/Gallifrey). 

So, back to the Great Intelligence. The Second Doctor was the first to encounter him, and since then the Doctor has met him a few times. His encounters with the GI seem to be pretty linear in the GI's perspective, but we can see the Doctor influenced one of his past encounters with him (unknowingly?) when he gave him the plans to the London Underground in The Snowmen.

So here we have the Doctor fighting a real life ""god"" (well a god in a sense of immensely powerful extra-dimensional being, quite an enemy to tackle, even compared to renegade Time Lords and hostile alien Robots). A fight he has been a part of for a very long time now (and probably more so from the GI's perspective than the Doctor's).

We don't know a lot about the GI's complete motivations or plans, but he has always sought a body, and he is usually accompanied with snow or ice, using powers to influence and manipulate sentient beings.

So to conclude this theory, lets see how these interesting coincidences might align to connect Clara and the GI, and what that means for Clara's future.







**Clara Reincarnated:**





My earliest theory was that Clara must be tied to these ""old gods"" I read about (either as one unknowingly, reincarnating throughout time, or related in some other way). But now I think it is far simpler than that (if you can call any of his simple).

I think Clara is in some way being used by the Great Intelligence. Either he is planting her in each encounter, or she somehow does something in the future to attach herself to the GI's timeline.

This could be related to the GI's desire to have a body (trying to use Clara as some kind of vessel?) But I don't give that idea as much weight as Clara (the ordinary girl) herself doing something in the Finale to go back in the Doctor's timeline to help him (and help him *remember* something).

Now you might wonder how the GI is related to Clara's first appearance in Asylum, but think of the prison world itself. It was covered in snow and ice, and the Dalek nanotechnology worked very similar to the way the GI spreads and influences. It could very well be the GI was there (its physical presence is very muddled as it isn't a physical being) but we just weren't made aware. We know Victorian Clara, and Current Clara both met the Doctor with the appearance of the GI, so I think its possible to see some connection.

The way this villain is constructed allows him to be inserted into many theories, and many past events in the Moffat era. I can't say with any certainty how much, but I think we will see him emerge in the Finale. And if the Finale is when we learn the Doctor's name, it could very well mean a connection to the Silence and past arcs as well. I don't know the exact stakes the GI would have in the Doctor's name itself (plenty of other theories on its importance and how that will play out), but I don't think he was re-introduced with Victorian Clara, and again with Current Clara, defeated but not extinguised, is no mistake or coincidence. I am sure we will see him again, and very likely in this finale if we are learning what the reincarnations of Clara really mean.

That is about it for my theory, just a lot of perceived connections that leave room for lots of interpretation. But these are just interesting things I don't see discussed too often, and would love to see someone else's thoughts who knows more lore than I (a New Who lover who also goes Wiki Diving).

Apologies for the unorganized mess this might be to read, but they are strings of many thoughts over this season, and I finally just had to jot them down. Hope to hear what you think!

If you like any of the theories, I will bring more for the future of our Doctor in:

Unlike many shadowy groups in Doctor Who they kept a mystique-filled build up for *four years*.

The Shadow Proclamation was a set of rules, a force of governing order so powerful that it set rules that would make massive armies grow hesitant in breaking. They were the constant throughout all of the Doctor's travels in New Who.

Now I know they weren't as hyped up as Torchwood or ""Bad Wolf"" but that's one of the things I really liked about it. It was gradual, it's inclusion felt like the natural leaving of breadcrumbs culminating in what (I had hoped, at least) would be an amazing climax.

What we got was an albino in a waiting room full of Judoons standing next to the Doctor as he fiddled with the holograms. Woefully disappointing especially  considering that the Judoon were previously established as being ""thug police for hire"" and certainly not in the level of official capacity (they actually *broke* some of the articles of the Proclamation, for Pete's sake!)

Anyway, I know this is a wound long since healed over but I was seriously bummed by how the Proclamation got this amazing ""**WE'RE GOING TO SEE THE SHADOW PROCLAMATION**"" by the Doctor followed by a pathetic fizzle that only acted as a plot segue.

Some interesting ones to highlight are:

* Genesis of the Cybermen - As the title suggests, a cyberman origins story; this would have been interesting as aside from *Spare Parts* and *Age of Steel* we haven't really had one.
*  The Six Doctors - Robert Holmes' version of the 20th anniversary. I can't find much on it but I'm presuming somehow a sixth Doctor would be involved (future incarnation sort of thing perhaps?)
* Dalek Labyrinth - Rejected for being too expensive to produce, I'm presuming it would have been the Doctor navigating a maze full of daleks and traps. EDIT: It appears I misread it, it's *Dark Labyrinth*. 
* Gallifrey - Written by writers of the acclaimed *Time and the Rani*, Jane and Pip Baker, this story would have told how the Doctor's home world was destroyed. It would close the gap between the two-year hiatus, similar to the time war in the modern series.
* The Suicide Exhibition - One of the few unmade episodes of the modern series. A Mark Gatiss story involving Nazis and monsters trapped in a museum. It was later re-worked by Moffat into *The Big Bang*.

A sort of realistic scenario of Doctor-swapping.

-----------------

First Doctor: Why am I standing around with a bunch of monks?! one meddling one is enough. Oh well, I had time to work on my water colours, who is this woman anyway?

*Reads ‘run clever boy and remember’* Hmmmm, no, can’t remember, oh well can’t be important, time to move on.

At Clara’s house she is being uploaded. The Doctor rushes in and looks at the robot thing. He starts bashing it with his stick. Eventually it explodes.

The Doctor wraps a blanket around Clara and nose bops her.

First Doctor: Silly Child. Hmmm. Rest now dear girl.

He eats a jammie dodger and yelps in pain. he mumbles and groans. 

First Doctor:  (Mumbling) My fuffing tooth.

He leans over to see if Clara is alright, she opens her eye and his beaming wide grin is staring back at her.

First Doctor: Back with us, hmmm? 

*Clara lets out a loud piercing scream.*

Clara: Get out of my bedroom you old perv!

…

Clara: is that a snogging booth?!

First Doctor: *scoffs* I knew Chesterton and Barbara would leave a reputation. No, my dear, none of that business I’m afraid.Not since Cameca stowed aboard anyway.

The plane is heading for Clara’s road.

Doctor: Oh dear, dear me, goodness gracious, hope you weren’t fond of this road, come along dear girl, into the TARDIS. Nothing can be done. There’ll be a big crater here soon. Oh by the way, you won’t be able to go home for a while…

…

The First Doctor rides the motorcycle across London and arrives near the Shard.

First Doctor: The bike’s a bit temperamental, let’s hope she works, set the anti-gravitational button! Ha ha, here we go!!!!!!!!

The Doctor drives forward, nears the building and instead of the motorcycle going up the building, it simply crashes through. The Doctor shakes his head and heads for the lift.

First Doctor: There’s a problem with the Wiffy? 

Woman: You mean the Wi-fi?

First Doctor: Don’t correct me madam. Anyway, I’m not ‘me’, haha, I’m a robot version of myself, hmmm? Hahaha. Now you’re going to get a taste of your own medicine. 

…

First Doctor: Come with me Clara.

Clara: Ask me tomorrow.

First Doctor: I’m not a boomerang, nor am I a bus service. dear dear, if you don’t come with me now who knows when I can come back to ask you.

First Doctor: So Clara Oscarson Oswinwald, time to find out who you are! But not really because I’ve taken off and I’ve no idea where you are and I’ll probably never see you again. Except apparently I keep meeting you anyway, so I’ll wait til I jump a time track or something.

So there's a couple of references in there, try and spot them! Plus that whole part about the Doctor being a perv?

However, I'm not entirely sure how well that consistency translated into a successful season of television.

Moffat &amp; Co. intended each of these episodes to be its own big blockbuster, without any significant links between them.  I think this was a big mistake in a season where two long-running characters were making their final exit from the show.  While I feel that Manhattan was for the most part a fantastic episode, the whole thing felt kind of sprung on us.  It wasn't built up well enough at all.  It felt like just another story and then, ZAP They're gone!  Hardly a way for the longest-running companions to leave the show.

Another problem was the order and time of each episode.  It was unclear how long it had been for the Doctor (hell, even what order the Doctor was experiencing this stuff in), how long it had been for Amy and Rory, and what kind of changes they'd been going through since we last saw them.  It was almost like Amy and Rory were different characters in each episode because they went through so many experiences on their own that we didn't see.  The Power of Three really illustrated this problem: somehow Amy had been through several jobs and we found out that they had been traveling with the Doctor for ten whole years.  It really made me feel like I wasn't witnessing all of this important stuff, and that I didn't know these characters as well as I should have.  

Part of the fun of past Doctor Who is that there was that rentless forward momentum that made us feel like we were traveling with the Doctor, and this year it feels like we're outside observers.  This is why we don't follow companions after they leave the TARDIS; It makes for a disjointed experience.

The big blockbuster approach to each episode was an overcorrection from last year's arc heavy season.  It really makes you wonder: since Moffat is not the kind of guy to answer to any criticism, was this a bad decision on his part or did the BBC push him to make the episodes more accessible because of the new big-tent global audience?  Either way it wasn't successful, and I'm *so* looking forward to a new permanent compaion.

I therefore decided to create my own guide with reasons why I believe the stories are important when using them to introduce people to Classic Doctors. This will be x-posted to other subs as well, but this is a more nit-picky one and a perfect place to do a test run. I'll only be submitting 1 story per Doctor, and I'll be defending my reasons for it. I'll be going all the way to 11. Let's get to it, shall we?

1. William Hartnell - 1st Doctor: The Dalek Invasion of Earth
 The story is a great introduction to Hartnell's initial Doctor, and he shines in this one. We get Daleks and we get to see what they are capable of in context of future stories. The Doctor's granddaughter is also involved and it helps when she is referenced later. The main reason to watch, however, is the performance. Hartnell's Doctor was silly to a degree, with the ability to keep composure but still be a fun old man. He had a playful personality and it comes out to a degree here and makes it a perfect introduction to him.

2. Patrick Troughton - Second Doctor: The Mind Robber
 A Master story, can it get any better? Oh wait, it can because this is also a battle of fictional characters within a fiction. This episode was what got me into the show as a real fan, and shows why Troughton solidified the show's popularity throughout its early trials.

3. John Pertwee - Third Doctor: The Curse of Peladon
 James Bond of the Doctors! Pertwee was trapped on Earth in exile from Gallifrey, and as a result had a car named Bessie and worked with UNIT as a science advisor and such. This story highlights the 3rd Doctor's personality the best (in my oh-so-humble opinion) and shows his suave yet action-oriented story style. Fun fact, I believe if I'm not mistaken he was also the first Doctor to use a Sonic Screwdriver.

4. Tom Baker - Fourth Doctor: The Ark in Space
 Sorry to those who would put forth *Genesis of the Daleks* as the story to watch, but this one is my favorite. He's just so...alien. There's a reason he's got a bandwagon about him, and it was because he was the least human Doctor yet. His buggy eyes, his huge shock of burnette curls, and the odd smile he gets when he offers someone a Jelly Baby all contribute to his strange performance, and putting him on a ship meant to save humanity? Perfect. The story of the Wirrn possessions and transformations give this a darker, meaner, yet fairly lighthearted story that makes it a grand introduction to arguably the most popular Doctor (even if he isn't your favorite, the statement is objectively true).

5. Peter Davison - Fifth Doctor: The Caves of Androzani
 Unfortunately for Davison his final story was also his best. I love most of his run, don't get me wrong, but some of his stories are a little...well silly. At least to me. Androzani, however, is special. Its such a rough story, and shows the Doctor's regret as he whispers the name of a fallen companion on his deathbed. He shows his youth here, but now is where we begin to see him for the Old Man in a Young Body that he is becoming. He was young for the first time in years (centuries by his reckoning) but he had a rough time.

6. Colin Baker - Sixth Doctor: Trial of a Time Lord
 I recommend this one not because its perfect, but for its flaws mixed with its triumphs. The show was hit and miss during this period (it always was, but here especially) and it became difficult to guess if you'd enjoy the episodes at this point. The Doctor was portrayed with a bit more eccentricity than necessary (you'd overact in that coat to, don't deny it) but with a darkness to it. We get to see him silly, angry, triumphant, and an utter failure. Its a bit of a watch at 14 episodes but well worth it. Bonus! We get the Master and the Valeyard, and the latter's appearance has sparked so much debate and discussion that one might find watching the whole thing worth it merely for that.

7. Sylvester McCoy - Seventh Doctor: Remembrance of the Daleks
 Its McCoy, its Daleks, he wears a sweater vest covers in question marks! Seriously though, this story is also chosen to highlight the history of the series with references as well as for McCoy's manipulative ability as the titular character. Enjoy.

8. Paul McGann - Eighth Doctor: Doctor Who TV Film
 This is a ridiculously hard one to talk about because while I despise Eric Roberts's portrayal of The Master I love McGann's Doctor (yeah, he kisses someone, one of them is going to be a romantic). He brings a fun and lighthearted spirit to it amidst the plot-hole-ridden script and always manages to keep that at the forefront. He is one of the youngest in spirit amongst the incarnations, even feeling like a man in his early 20's at times, and he adds something to the role even if the story is thin as hell.

9. Chris Eccleston - Ninth Doctor: The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances
 Moffat makes his entrance! After the dark portrayal of this Doctor got bogged down with fat, farting aliens and awkward interactions due to scripts he got this creepy story set in WWII with a small zombie child in a gas mask and we got Jack Harkness for the first time. We got a discussion of the Doctor and the fact that in his 900-ish years of life he's 'danced' with women at some point. Overall the eerie story and the mean, angry portrayal finally balanced and we got the first truly excellent story from this era.

10. David Tennant - Tenth Doctor: The Girl in the Fireplace
 Many will cite *Blink* and while that is usually the first episode of the show that I have people watch my favorite will always be this entry. The Doctor shows affection, the Doctor drinks a daiquiri, The Doctor hides the fact that he fell in love, and there is a lot of discussion about what being with the Doctor does to people. 

11. Matt Smith - Eleventh Doctor: Amy's Choice
 Arguably the best of his episodes (yes yes, I'm aware that Gaiman wrote one) this one involves the Doctor's own darkness coming at him. Smith is whimsical and youthful even though he carries the weight of an old warrior. His anger is an issue and even worse he is a constant wrench in the gear with his friends, but his Darkness takes on form (something I consider to be a hint at the still-coming Valeyard) and messes with them all. Its a vicious look at what truly lies in The Doctor's heart after all he's done, and its not a bad place to start with this Doctor.

1369000974.0,86,self.gallifrey,1enltl,[Spoilers] How I think a certain Doctor might be coming back for the 50th.,109,23,61,http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/1enltl/spoilers_how_i_think_a_certain_doctor_might_be/,"Disclaimer: this is not exactly what I think will happen as much as it is what I hope will happen, but I certainly think it's plausible.

Alright, so one of the most popular theories I've seen on this subreddit is that our mysterious Not-Doctor is either a missing regeneration between Eight and Nine, or, alternatively, and aged Eight after his experiences in the Time War.
Personally, I subscribe to the ""aged Eight"" theory, but it just doesn't sit right with me that they're going to bring back Eight and have him be played by somebody other than McGann. After all, he's aged incredibly well and seems rather eager to come back- in fact, he's probably the most readily available past-Doctor besides Tennant.
Another thing worth noting: Tennant and Smith hinted in their behind-the-scenes video that, in relation to their Doctors, there was a third character that they ""couldn't talk about,"" and that this mysterious character seemed rather ""bemused"" by the two Doctors, even though Ten and Eleven rather enjoyed each other's company. Some have speculated that this is the Not-Doctor, but that doesn't quite make sense because he seems more likely to be a villain than a Doctor that the other two can team up with and have very much interaction with. Other, much more crazy fans say it'll be Eccleston, but c'mon, he's not coming back.

You probably see where I'm going with this by now. Yes, I believe McGann could be returning for the 50th.

""How?"" you say. Well, this depends on what role John Hurt will play. For all we know he's a good guy, but based on the way they've set him up I think he's going to be a Valeyard-esque villain.
So that being said, let's say that, as a result TNotD's ending, John Hurt goes on some kind Doctor-hunt across time and space, trying to alter the Doctor's timeline.

This might explain how Ten and Eleven meet, Ten manages to dodge John Hurt's scheme and he meets up with Eleven to stop him. Now, this theory gets blown out of the water if it turns out Tennant is actually going to be playing the meta-crisis Doctor, but I don't think that's where they're going with this because hopping between universes just seems out of place in this story, how would the need for that be justified?

So now we've covered how Tennant comes back, why can't McGann do the same? Now there's Eight, Ten, and Eleven, all joined forces to stop the John Hurt Doctor, who, like I said earlier, is an aged version of Eight. This could be interesting, because Ten and Eleven would know who the not-Doctor is and why they're fighting him, but Eight would be left in the dark and Ten/Eleven would have to dodge explaining it to him, not wanting to let him know how he ends up in the future.

This is also an opportunity to finally clear up the McGann-Eccleston regeneration, which is a major gap in Doctor Who continuity. Picture this: John Hurt has prevailed in his evil schemes, Ten and Eleven are helpless, hooked up into molecular dispersal chamber or whathaveyou, Eight is lying on the ground, trying to reach his sonic but Hurt kicks it away, and, seeing the situation as being utterly hopeless, someone lets out that Anti-Doctor is actually future Eight. Eight is shocked, but then sees suddenly how he can prevent all of this from happening. In an unexpected act of heroism, Eight regenerates, thus effectively preventing the John Hurt Doctor from ever existing, because now McGann can never become him.
Hurt lets out a throaty ""NOOOOoooo..."" and disappears in a puff of plot resolution. The walls begin to crumble, the timeline is returning to normal. Just before time snaps back, the newly regenerated Nine stands up and we see the back of his head or something, but it's just worked in from old footage- Eccleston hasn't reprised his role.

And so, the day is saved, Ten and Eleven say goodbye and return to their own timelines. The 50th has now featured doctors 8-11 without having to actually bring back Eccleston, and has shown the 8-9 regeneration.

With the final fan spinning oat top speed the Doctor closes his eyes and concentrates and then simply walks through the blades untouched. Now the new series was my first exposure to Doctor Who so I assumed that he had some sort of ability to control time. But he hasn't done anything similar since. So what exactly did he do?

Second, In ""Father's Day"" The Doctor is able to use the Tardis key to summon the Tardis itself. But how many times has the Doctor's biggest problem been being unable to reach the Tardis? Was he only able to do this because he was in a Paradox at the time?

Even Dorium states that The Doctor has had a dangerous past, but his *future is infinitely more terrifying*.

Cold War had both the HADS and the Ice Warriors.  The HADS is only ever mentioned in the TV series in a Second Doctor episode and then later in Cold War.  The Ice Warriors were introduced during the Second Doctor's run and he had three serials mentioning them.

Hide had the blue crystal of Metebelis III, a very important plot point during the Third Doctor's reign.

In Lets Kill Hitler someone in the Teselecta mentions that JFK's death may have been rewritten (they do it in a very off beat way so it may be a bit hard to remember/find) and in The Wedding of River Song River mentions her hallucinogenic lipstick working on Kennedy.  These may just be call back but I don't think so.  We are way to close to the 50th to assume things are just done for the fun of it.  I think there setting up for the 50th were they will be a three Doctor (9th, 10th, and 11th) crossover taking place during the JFK assassination.  We already know 9 was there (we see a picture of it in Rose) so all the pieces are in places. 

What do you guys think of a three Doctor crossover during the JFK assassination?

Even the [music](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5D-QPDGhCtM) exudes heroism and grandeur.

Sometimes this can be fun.  I admit, I kinda enjoyed [this scene](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbihgxRYMCE) despite its over-the-top nature.  Yet, to me it always feels slightly out of place to try and achieve that ""hollywood"" atmosphere in the structure of a 45 minute long episode for a family show.



The writers get too caught up in trying to create great tales of heroism, and as a result, things can feel unnatural.  I can't be the only person who though [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ecycHAZtaM) was a little overblown.  I'm always disappointed by season finales, because it feels like so much effort is put into making them ridiculously epic, that important things, like satisfying plot resolutions, are consistently overlooked.  It feels like every series tries to 1-up the last in the 'oh-my-god-we-are-so-dead' department.  


I imagine the monologue taking place in Russel T Davies head as he thought out the plot arc for series 1 and 2 went something along the lines of: *""What's more deadly than 1 dalek?  An invasion with LOADS of daleks.  What's more deadly than loads of daleks? An invasion of LOADS of daleks AND cybermen.""*



The Doctor is becoming an almost legendary figure, and whilst sometimes this is pulled of with a degree of subtlety, far too often it just makes me cringe.  [This line](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuxeKeuzsU4) sounded akin to some of the cheesy one-liners said by the superheroes in Marvel movies - it just doesn't suit Doctor Who.



[This scene](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIj21QuJoAg) was generally [appreciated](http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/1bt15e/the_rings_of_akhenaten_discussion/c99s069), so I understand I'm in a minority here, but to me it felt like an entire episode of nothingness had been built in order to shoe-horn in this B movie-esque monologue, that sounded like Carl Sagan with brain damage.  I won't even bother to comment upon the naff music in the background, or the fact he's talking to a giant fiery pumpkin - just watch it.



So what do I like?  I know the episode has already achieved a God-like status here, but 'Blink' is a truly brilliant example of an episode which plays to the strengths of Doctor Who.  Its concept driven, small-scale, atmospheric, with well integrated [emotional scenes](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACN8G6FDO0E) that don't obstruct the flow of narrative.  Similarly, 'The Empty Child' and 'The Doctor Dances' are concept driven episodes, in which Moffat successfully strikes a balance between having the Doctor be a very charismatic and likeable protagonist without it seeming like the episode was created as a tribute to his awesomeness.

For me, I love Miss Evangelista from The Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead. I think her character development made a brilliant point about societal pressure to act a certain way based on appearances. Initially, she is not taken seriously, and you get the impression that, because of her looks, she has never been taken seriously in her entire life and has been told that she can't possibly be smart. The crew are constantly belittling her and treating her as 'just a pretty face', which is a role she has accepted. She obviously believes them when they tell/treat her as if she is stupid and her opinions don't matter until she is saved by CAL and is changed by the transcription error I think the fact that Moffat chose to include a physical distortion in that transcription error speaks volumes of how much value society puts on looks/exterior value, especially for women. When she tells Donna,  ""I have the two qualities you require to see absolute truth: I am brilliant. And unloved."" the idea is that she is unloved because she has lost her value as a woman(person) in society because she is now ugly. This one sentence also speaks to the idea of conflict between societal norms and the idea of moral truth: the two shall never co-exist. I am sure there's a lot more going on here that I haven't touched on/sorry if this is a bit jumbled.

You could have half-reverted Cybermen in conflict over how much farther to go on the path back to humanity, worried about losing their ruggedness and information sharing abilities and being left vulnerable against unknown future agressors.

I'm aware Star Trek already did it with the Borg, but so what?  The Borg can easily be seen as a Cyberman rip-off.

1372551714.0,81,self.gallifrey,1hc702,The Cartmel Masterplan and The Hurt Doctor...a theory,101,20,47,http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/1hc702/the_cartmel_masterplan_and_the_hurt_doctora_theory/,"Now, we've all heard plenty of theories regarding the end of ""The Name of the Doctor"", and just who John Hurt's ""Doctor"" is. We've heard that he's the Valeyard, that he's Doctor 8.5, that he's Doctor 2.5 even. While those theories have some merits, they can also easily be argued against. So, I suggest we instead go even further back in the history of the Doctor. In fact, let's go so far back as to the dawn of the Society of Time Lords. 

Now, as most of us know, there are two figures responsible for Gallifrey's ability to time travel and the founding of the Society of Time Lords: Rassilon and Omega. However, it has also been heavily implied that there was a third figure who worked with them in the shadows...a figure known as The Other. 

Now, if this is starting to sound familiar to you, then you are aware of what is considered ""The Cartmel Masterplan"", which began in the final two years of the Seventh Doctor's run, but was never realized due to the show's cancellation. On the episodes that did show, however, there was hints that the Doctor was ""more than just another Time Lord"", even going so far as to have the Doctor slip up and say ""**we** had trouble with the prototype (with the Hand of Omega)"",  in *Remembrance of the Daleks*. The plan was to exentually reveal that The Doctor was with Rassilon and Omega, but not as The Doctor. 

This in itself answers several questions from the classic series: The ""other Doctors"" from the mind war sequence in *Brain of Morbeus*, Omega's interest in The Doctor during *The Three Doctors* (he says he just wanted a Time Lord, but why go out of his way to get to Earth when Gallifrey was right there), and, of course, the aforementioned hints in the Seventh Doctor's run.

With the Cartmel Masterplan in mind, is it really that hard to surmise that the Hurt Doctor is in fact The Other from Time Lord history? My guess is that what he did is huge, and without a doubt involves his betrayal of Rassilon and Omega (which I think is part of the Cartmel Masterplan, but I could be wrong). As a result, The Other changes himself to become The Doctor and flees Gallifrey to escape the Time Lords (the whole ""you've been running your whole life"" bit in virtually every Stefan Moffat episodes, but most notably in *The Wedding of River Song*). What he did (which involves stopping Rassilon and Omega), he did in the name of The Other, not in the name of The Doctor.

Also, for those curious [here's an in depth analysis of The Cartmel Masterplan](http://thatguywiththeglasses.com/videolinks/teamt/nash/specials/36631-doctor-who-classic-the-cartmel-masterplan), which involves its implimentation in both canon and non-canon sources (for the sake of the argument, I've chosen to ignore the parts involving the non-canon realizations of the Masterplan, as well as the parts with Ace)

Any thoughts? I feel like this theory has the most to back it up, with evidence from both the old series and the new series.

We want to welcome all of our new subscribers and give a big Thank You to our older members for making /r/Gallifrey as great as it is. 

And with this new surge in subscribers it seems like now is a good time to go over some of the rules and policies here, and to make some minor announcements.

---

####Spoiler Policy/Link Flairs or the 'why isn't my post showing up?' section:

* **Spoiler Policy**

    The spoiler policy here in /r/Gallifrey is, in it's simplest, don't put spoilers in the title of posts and mark comments with the (#s) spoiler tag for spoilers not related to the topic of the post.

    A spoiler for this subreddit is, ""plot related topics for future and current episodes up to 48 hours after their original air date"". Official BBC announcements affecting the plot of the show are spoilers for titles. Factual casting news, set changes, shooting locations are spoilers. Stating who the protagonist of a future episode is in the title is a spoiler.  
   
    Examples. If there is a rumor that the T.A.R.D.I.S it is getting a makeover, that is not a spoiler. If it's confirmed that it's getting a makeover, that's a spoiler. A vague, non-spoiler title is what we are asking for. ""What do you think of the new T.A.R.D.I.S design"", bad title. ""What do you think of the new set changes? [spoilers]"", good title. If a location shot is leaked for a future episode, don't title the post ""The Daleks on the set of the season premier!"". 
    
    *If your post title contains spoilers, it will be removed by a moderator. If your post has been removed, you can resubmit it with a different, non-spoiler title.*

      As for comments, if a post has been tagged ""Spoiler"" it's assumed the comments will contain spoilers, therefore we do not require commenters to use the (#s) spoiler tag for their comments in those posts. This is a warning if you want to avoid spoilers, do not open those posts.

   If the topic of the post is about a new set design and is marked [Spoiler], the comments do not need to be hidden with a (#s) code when you mention it. If you are in an unrelated post and want to comment on the redesign, the comment needs to be hidden with the (#s) code  or the comment will be removed by a mod until it is properly marked. (See sidebar for how to use this code)

    The moderators understand that certain news items, big announcements from the BBC, will be all over the internet and here in /r/Gallifrey but we ask that you to stick with our spoiler policy and be vague in your titles. This does not limit what you are allowed to discuss, it just allows people the ability to not be spoiled by titles.

    We really do want to have a light spoiler policy here, requiring you to do as little as possible while still giving the option to avoid learning about future episodes.


* **Link Flairs/Filtering**

    All posts are given link flairs by the mods to help identify whether or not they will contain some degree of spoilers. 

    These link flairs are used for our filtering options listed in the sidebar. (Please note because not all mobile users can see these tags we ask that you continue to mark your post with [Spoiler] in the title if it contains spoilers.)

    The filters in the sidebar give people the option to hide, or even show, all spoilers. These filters should be used by those wishing to avoid spoilers, we put the tag system into place but it is on you to use the filters. If you want to be as spoiler free as possible we recommend unsubbing from /r/Gallifrey and bookmarking one of these filters. The degree to how much you want to show or hide is up to you. 

    For way more detail about the specific link flairs and filters [here is the post](http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/1fhqnu/new_features_now_available_in_gallifrey_filtering/) explaining them.

* **""Why is my post not showing up?""**


   Lately we have been getting more people wondering why their posts are not appearing after they have been submitted. This normally happens for three reason. 

    1) Your title contained a spoiler and was removed by a moderator.

    2) It was caught in the reddit spam filter.

    3) And the most likely reason; it has not been tagged yet by a moderator:

    The filter/flair system is setup so the default viewing of /r/Gallifrey will not display posts until they have been tagged by a moderator. We have this in place due to people purposely trying to post spoilers in titles to troll the subreddit. (For those new here, this has happened in the past.) Because of this setting, your post will not appear in the default 'new' queue until a mod has added a link flair. 

    To verify that your post has been submitted and not removed by a mod or stuck in the spam fitler, use this link: http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/#header. This will show all untagged submissions.

###Respect, Civility and for the love of the Doctor, please don't click the downvote button:

* **/r/Gallifrey is meant to be a place for friendly, open discussion about Doctor Who.**

    The rules for respect, courtesy &amp; civility are required for posting and commenting in this subreddit. This has not become a big issue recently but I wanted to make sure the rule is clear. Personal insults, no matter how they are dressed up, against others member here are not allowed. If you cannot maintain civility, the moderators will issue a warning. If the behavior continues, a ban will result. This includes sending PM's.

* **Please use the downvote with careful and deliberate discretion.**

    Downvotes are not for disagreeing or for topics you are not interested in. A subreddit specially for discussion has little use for downvoting if the post or comment adds to the discussion. If a post is not relevant, report it and a mod will review it. If you do not agree with the poster, think their theory is silly, or have seen the topic far too often, it does not mean it should be downvoted. Too often for this subreddit, posts are downvoted for being an unpopular opinion or because people feel it was a not well thought-out post.

    One reason downvoting is not a good thing here, posts that go into the negative are removed from the front page. You might not be interested in the topic but by downvoting it you are potentially causing people that might be interested to not see the post. The other reason, downvoting discourages people from expressing their thoughts about the show. That goes against what this subreddit stands for. Downvotes should be reserved for comments that are not part of the discussion or add little value. A rant about why someone doesn't like a new episode should not be downvoted, a one-off joke or meme or just a link to a reaction gif, those are what are not relevant to this subreddit.

    We should be encouraging discussions and discouraging puns and jokes, and not making people feel uncomfortable expressing why they disagree with a point or for asking a question.

###A few small announcements:

* **IRC**

    The /r/Gallifrey community has an IRC now, a 24x7 chat room. Come on over and hang out. *Please note that this chat has no spoiler rules.*

    [irc.snoonet.org/gallifrey](irc://irc.snoonet.org/gallifrey)

    [Web Client link](https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.snoonet.org/gallifrey)

* **Minor layout changes coming soon.**

    We will be doing some very minor layout changes in the next few weeks, adding in a couple requests such as making a more prominent link to the FAQ. Some other changes will be purely aesthetic but nothing drastic.

    We would like to hear your suggestions before making these changes. Is there anything in the sidebar you would like to see added? Do you want even more orange!!?? We want to hear from you.

**1. First Doctor**: I think generally this is the obvious choice for longest lived, he certainly looked the part and if Eleven can parade around for 200 years and look like he's 30, One has to been *old*.

**2. Eleventh Doctor**: 200 years is sure a heck of a lot longer than some of the shortest lived incarnations. 

**3. Eighth Doctor**: Who knows how long he lived? Heck, Hurt's Doctor could simply be a really old Eight for all we know. He had quite the long life

**4. Seventh Doctor**: He is older in the TV Movie, and also has had quite the long life in spin-off stuff. And even discounting that, the fact that he looks older in the Movie is enough.

**5. Sixth Doctor**: The possibility for travel after Trial of the Time Lord is quite limitless, he could've lived hundreds of years before Mel met him

**6. Second Doctor**: The majority of his life was spent in Season 6B, as the only time he could actually travel was almost entirely with Jamie who didn't age much at all. But the Second Doctor aged in later appearances.

**7. Fourth Doctor**: Here the television duration does matter, that alone cements him in this spot.

**8. Ninth Doctor**: I like to think the Ninth Doctor had been messing around a while before he met Rose, doing Nine things.

**9. Third Doctor**: Spent a lot of his life in linear time on Earth, got freedom to use the TARDIS late in his life, and spent a few years on Earth. First of the short-lived incarnations.

**10. Tenth Doctor**: 901-906 (as he claimed) is only five years and quite short for a Time Lord's incarnation. 

**11. Fifth Doctor**: Considering Tegan was there most of the run and barely aged followed by not many adventures, Five did not last long.

The Doctor's name is the key to unlocking the timelock, this makes since we have seen before that words, especially names, hold a lot of power in the Doctor Who universe.  If the only other people in the universe who know his name(the other Timelords) are all in the timelock then the Doctors name would be the safest word to use.

Someone (hopefully the master) will lure the Doctor to the fields of trezlalore where he will have to anwser any question asked. After being forced to say his name and unlock the time war this will be the lowest point of the eleventh, the fall, unleashing both the timelords and the daleks back in the universe.  Moffat has said there wil be a somnething that will change Doctor Who forever and bringing back the Time Lords would certinly do just that.  He is a huge fan of the classic series which is why it wouldnt be a suprise that he would want them back since they  were such a big part of them.  All of the classic reference this season support something big from the old series returning.

This would also explain why the slience is so adamant about the Doctor not making it there because they know how horrible having the time war unclocked would be.  I think this would be a great set up for the 50th by having both 10 and 11 being chased by the timelords for what they did to them.

Anything that has not aired on TV yet or anything that aired less than 48 hours ago is considered a spoiler. If you want to discuss something that a lot of people haven't seen such as a novel or audio drama, then any spoilers related to that should not be in the title, although I can't think of that ever happening. Anything that has aired, either as part of classic who or new who is fair game (after the first 48 hours). Anything that was read in an article or on twitter or anything like that is a spoiler if it is related to anything that is unaired.

I started to buy CDs, T-shirts, books and even Records of the Beatles. This soon led to me discovering other 60's bands like The Guess Who and Jefferson Airplane and their songs. It introduced me to the Rock music scene which eventually led me to bands like Nirvana and Hendrix and ELO. I started picking up a guitar to learn the songs I was hearing and sing along to them.

Second, the idea of 'what defines a person' was brilliant, both on paper and in execution. The point where Amy treated the real Doctor bad, thinking he was the Doppelganger was excellently done.

Think about it. Consider what it would be like if you didn't have a name, meeting so many people over such a long time. Usually, we use a title like ""the doctor"" or ""the plumber"" or ""the waiter"" in a few ways. 

The first way is using titles to assign anonymity to or dehumanize a person. When you call ""the plumber"" to fix your drains, you aren't calling an individual, you're calling a complex tool to do something for you. You don't consider *who* (so punny) they are; the title makes their intrusion into your life as subtle as possible. They are an anonymous servant, essentially faceless.

Another way that we use titles like ""the surgeon"" is to put emphasis on someone's accomplishments. When we say, ""she's *the* astronomer,"" we attribute an air of originality or authority to someone in their actions. She is so damned good at astronomy that she pretty much invented the whole field. 

Finally, we use titles like ""the professor"" to refer to a person who is a common point of reference between multiple people when one of them doesn't realize whom we are talking about. ""Oh, John? He's the professor I was talking about earlier."" We contextualize a person's identity with their profession or their actions. 

So while it may be fascinating, I think it's somewhat fitting that the Doctor chooses a moniker. He wants anonymity; saving the day has never been about [posing for newspaper photographs while punching bad guys](http://imgur.com/8WHdcJO); it's been about stepping in, outsmarting the bad guys, and popping off to go have an adventure somewhere else. The Doctor doesn't do fame. But he's also the hero of countless living beings. He's so damn good at saving the world that he practically invented it. But finally, and most fittingly in my opinion, he is *mythos*. We speak of him in hushed whispers, describing him to others by telling tales of his great deeds. We look to him in awe, and he is defined throughout the universe by his actions. 

So I love the Doctor's concealment of his name, and I think it defines him. But perhaps it's time to change that. Perhaps it's time for him to stop running and examine why he is running in the first place. Maybe it's time for him to figure out *who* he is.",SPOILER,False,,t5_2tf29,1366414045.0,g,,True,t3_1cphkj,http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/1cphkj/lets_stop_for_a_moment_and_consider_the_doctors/,

Okay, so after watching 7B's finale, we know a few things:

1. John Hurt is an incarnation of the Doctor
2. John Hurt committed an act so terrible that he does not deserve the title of ""Doctor"" anymore.
3. Clara never saw John Hurt, and never saved John Hurt when she saved all the Doctor's incarnations up to 11.
4. The name you choose is a promise you make.

**So first question, what incarnation is John Hurt?**

The most popular rumor (and possible leak) is that Hurt is an incarnation in between McGann and Eccleston. However, if that were the case, once Hurt did no. 2 as above, any and all future incarnations of the doctor (including Eccleston, Tennant, and Smith) cannot be called Doctor anymore. The name you choose is a promise, and promises don't reset themselves once you regenerate, you're still the same person.

Remember also, in The Beast Below, this idea is reinforced when the Doctor states that once he kills the star whale, he cannot call himself the Doctor anymore.

Ergo, that means John Hurt, because of his actions, and because promises cannot be reset, cannot possibly be a prior incarnation of the Doctor. He's a future incarnation, possibly the Valeyard because of the callback this episode, or possibly also the Final Incarnation.

**Second question, if that were the case, how is it possible that the Doctor recognizes him?**

Simple. The Doctor has met this future incarnation before.

We all know that's certainly possible. The Doctor has met his previous/future (depending on which doctor) incarnations before; and we all know, thanks to the Valeyard, not all incarnations of the Doctor can/will be good. 

**Third question, why didn't Clara recognize him?**

When the Great Intelligence entered the Doctor's time stream, his plan was to ""rewrite every living moment"", I would presume that meant killing the present Doctor by killing all his previous incarnations, not his future ones. So when the Great Intelligence entered the time stream to enact this plan, the time stream was effectively cut short up to the present Doctor. 

Ergo when Clara jumps in to save the Doctor, she only visited all previous incarnations of the Doctor and save them. John Hurt being a future incarnation, he did not materialize until after Clara achieved her goal.

**Fourth Question, when did the Doctor previously meet John Hurt?**

My guess is that John Hurt was also involved in the Time War and met the 8th Doctor during those events. Remember, it's a *Time* War, and therefore it's conceivable that past / future incarnations of the Time Lords could have also stepped in and gotten involved.

**Fifth Question, what did John Hurt do?**

The popular theory is that John Hurt was the one that created the Moment which resulted in the Time Lock and ended the Time War. However, remember that in previous episodes, 9th, 10th, and I think even the 11th Doctor already mentioned that they did not regret their decision (and in 10's case, he made that decision again during ""The End of Time""). So that particular action therefore does not deserve the title of Doctor being revoked.

My guess is that John Hurt was instrumental in advising and/or creating the Ultimate Sanction that Rassilon was planning to use to win the Time War, forcing the Doctor's hand and creating his own counter-measure, the Moment, that would stop the Time War but not destroy the universe.

This also explains why the Doctor gets so mad everytime he sees his own future, because he knows that the moment he sees his own future it becomes a fixed point in time, and he can never change it. That means that by being witness to Hurt's actions during the Time War and knowing who he is, he knows that some day, somehow he **will** be that person...

1365364644.0,75,self.gallifrey,1bvbkt,[Spoilers TRoA] Some thoughts about suspension of disbelief in Doctor Who,92,17,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/1bvbkt/spoilers_troa_some_thoughts_about_suspension_of/,"Reading the discussions people have had about the Rings of Akhenetan, I saw that many people have found it hard to suspend disbelief in a lot of episodes because the show is too out there. I would argue that 1) the newest episode is not too hard to believe, and 2) expecting some sort of explanation in the show would be detrimental to the message and story of the show.

**About the Seven Worlds and Rings of Akhenetan:**

They are obviously a highly advanced society, with members from 7 worlds, but in the show we see a site of tradition. You wouldn't see much of the full potential of their technology. I assumed, since the Doctor and Clara were able to breath between the rocks in the ring, that there was air all around them. 
See Niven's The Integral Trees for an imagined world that consists of a ""Smoke Ring"" of gas orbiting a neutron star at such a distance that their is a breathable atmosphere and normal temperatures. This is a hard sci-fi story.

Obviously Doctor Who is not hard sci-fi, but the same could probably exist. There is a ring of gas and rock around the brown dwarf-like star with sufficient density that they would breath (though at least one of the species required a gas mask). The seven worlds could then exist in orbit slightly outside and slightly inside, so that all could adjust to the temperatures inside the ring, and the planets could act as keepers of the ring, as Saturn's moons do. It would be slightly unstable, but there are many ways it could work. Perhaps instability caused one or more of the planets to collide, creating the ring in the first place.

It is also possible that the seven worlds are moons of a gas giant in a further orbit. Heat from the gas giant would make it livable.

It reminds me of the Xindi in Star Trek Enterprise. In this, six sapient species evolved on a single planet. When the show meets them, their original homeworld had been destroyed. One of the species was extinct. The five species were scattered wherever they could find a place to live. They hoped to find a new homeworld. 

Perhaps in the past this happened to Ahkenaten's species. They evolved on one planet (perhaps only one was intelligent, and genetically engineered the others a la Uplift, another hard sci-fi where humans have ""uplifted"" dolphins and apes). At some point, their homeworld is destroyed, and they escape to the other worlds in the system. In fact, the destruction of their world would be a good reason for the intelligent species to experiment with genetic engineering.  They could create beings to live on other worlds, and having other intelligent species with different capabilities could be helpful on worlds that were dissimilar to their own. Perhaps all of the species were originally the same, but have been engineered and have diverged over many, many years.

Since then, the original story has been lost, but they still believe that life began in the Rings of Akhenaten. This story makes sense. It is speculation, but it could happen, even in a hard sci-fi universe, with some tweaks and a lot of backstory and explanation.

**About Doctor Who in General:**

The point is, I don't find it any harder to suspend disbelief on Doctor Who than any other sci-fi show, though some are closer to reality than others. The difference is, Doctor Who isn't about the science or explanations. Star Trek is much more, because their stated purpose is to seek out new life on a scientific exploration mission.

The difference between Star Trek and Doctor Who is the focus, I think. Star Trek is very much about humans, so new discoveries are placed in (somewhat) scientific terms. The characters are at the forefront of science in Federation society, and frequently, experts from around the Federation have important roles in episodes. There are episodes with Warp field specialists and genetics specialists just about every season. It makes a point that the universe can be explained. There are interesting things out there, and we will be able to explain them someday. The show is an optimistic view of the future, where humans take their place in a wider interstellar community, founded on scientific and humanist (sapient-ist?) ideals.

The Doctor Who is about a Timelord. Their society was so advanced that compared to us they are post-science. [Clarke's Third Law](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClarkesThirdLaw) applies to them. The Timelords waged war such that lesser species did not know, even as their existence was threatened. Even their outdated technology could destroy the universe. They were gods. The Doctor realizes that they have gone too far. His story is about him recognizing the wonders of the universe and what ""lesser"" species can do. They rightly do not explain the science in most episodes. Sure, The Doctor often understands how things work, but would rather just appreciate it, rather than trivialize the accomplishments and/or traditions of the other species. Why else would he be so excited about humans? He loves to watch the human's accomplishments. He visits the first human colony on Mars as a big fan. He loves to show his companions the extent that humans will reach. He loves humans, because they show him that even the ""lesser"" species, with primitive technology are worth saving and their accomplishments are worth celebrating. He needs them because his companions are the ones that keep him in check. The keep him from being the vengeful god he could be, a vengeful god like the sun in the system of TRoA.

So yes, Doctor Who could explain more things in the stories, and allow you to suspend disbelief more. I believe that the Rings of Akhenetan or Bells of Saint John could be explained to fit in a sci-fi universe that is much closer to reality, but they shouldn't spend time doing that. With a few allowance for psychic stuff and visual effects, like pieces of the ring appearing so close together and magical artificial gravity, something that no TV series I have ever seen treats realistically, the world we are shown could be hard sci-fi. The hardest thing to explain would be the Tardis, something that people accept in every episode. The show just leaves that for you to figure out. The Doctor doesn't much care about the way other place's technology works, and it would be too difficult for him to explain to humans anyway. He just wants to show them the wonders of the universe.

1361733222.0,77,self.gallifrey,1957gd,My thoughts on Rose Tyler. ,101,24,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/1957gd/my_thoughts_on_rose_tyler/,"Hello /r/Gallifrey!
I should preface this with Rose Tyler is my favorite companion. This much will be obvious in the following paragraphs. I posted this to r/doctorwho to find out why most people on that subreddit hate Rose. I thought you might appreciate the 'defense' part of that post. So here is why I love Rose. 
.

I can understand why she is not a favorite; she comes off as clingy, possessive and common. But she was so, **so** human. 
The Doctor was broken. He had just come from the time war and was absolutely grief-stricken. Rose fixed him. She made him better because of how stunningly caring and human she was. He needed her. She was the one person who could fix him. 
 

Rose doesn’t just stand around, she puts up a fight.  She’s always sympathetic towards humans and aliens alike. Rose cared for a dalek and made it change, she made the Doctor better, she saved her father’s life because she couldn't let him die. But she gave him up in the end to make things right.


 Rose Tyler is brave. Fucking crazy brave. She’s encountered some of the scariest things in the universe, and she stood up to all of them on her own. Daleks, Slitheen, Cybermen, Sycorax, and a Werewolf just to name a few. Rose Tyler defeated Satan. It doesn’t get much braver than that.


 She fell in love with the most powerful man in the universe and he fell in love with her right back. Her love made him want to live and his love made her realize who she could be.


 She is the Bad Wolf. She came back for the Doctor. She took all the power in the universe inside of her and used it to take down the Dalek empire and save the world. She traveled through the void. She walked alone through lord knows how many different universes to save them all and find the Doctor. Who knows how many lives she saved and how many horrors she encountered by herself. 
Rose Tyler is a regular girl who became extraordinary. She was not rude. She was not annoying. She was brave and strong and caring and Human. She is the Only person in existence to show mercy for a Dalek. [Interesting character foil, River is the only person to ever make a dalek beg for mercy]


She brought the Doctor out of the darkness that was the time war so he could be here today, all bow ties and elbows. She is his true love, and will remain in his hearts forever. 


“From the moment they meet, the Doctor and Rose are soul mates. They understand and complement each other. What Rose brings to the Doctor’s life is completion. It’s completing a circle – he’s male, he’s alien, he’s a traveler. Between the two of them together they complement each other and discover each other. And are in love with each other – absolutely, unashamedly, unreservedly.” – Russell T Davies

“She’s the one woman, the one human, that can make him better – that can make him a bigger character, a better man.” – Julie Gardner

“From first holding the Doctor’s hand to a farewell on a beach, Rose is the Doctor’s reason to fight, to endure, to ensure there’s light in the darkness. Together they can achieve anything. As Episode 9 describes it, they are the stuff of legends.” – Julie Gardner

I would say mine is that most of the things we saw in the Tenth Doctor's tenure - his love for Rose, his thoughts on regeneration - were unique to that particular regeneration, and as much as they are a part of the Doctor on the whole, they're not reflective of the man in his entirety. In other words, if it was any other Doctor standing in Bad Wolf Bay in ""Doomsday"", they might have outright told Rose that they couldn't love her in return; if it was any other Doctor in *The End of Time*, they would have faced their regeneration square in the eye and said ""Bring it on.""

EDIT: Maybe a better starter would have been that I don't want to see what happened during the Time War. I think it works best in our imagination, and any on-screen depiction would fall woefully short of meeting millions of expectations.

It always comes down to people claiming, factually, how there is no more regeneration limit because either there are no more Time Lords, or because River Song somehow gave The Doctor more regenerations when she healed him.

So, for once, I'd like to have some discussion that doesn't make wild claims about the regeneration cycle(Such as the idea that Time Lords simply decide to obey the regeneration limit, and willingly die after their 13th life), and consider that, as far as we know, The Doctor really only does have a few lives left. I think the only obvious assumption we can make in this matter is that the Beeb is not going to let their longest running star simply die, and then never speak of him again. So then, that leaves the question, how do you think/hope he will eventually circumvent the regeneration limit? Do you want him to find a way to have unlimited regenerations, like Rassilon is rumored to have, or would you think it better to have him just gain a new cycle of 12 regenerations, leaving future writers to once more find a creative solution to his regeneration problem?

And, as a note, just please please **please** leave any theories about how regeneration limit is set by the existence of Time Lord society/Time War/River song theories out of the discussion. If it's what you truly believe, then at the end of the day I can't really stop you. Like I said before, I would just really like to see some discussion that doesn't involve the same assumptions I see that pop up every time the regeneration limit is discussed.

Please, I'd like to take a moment to remind people that /r/gallifrey is a place of discussion, and it is discouraged to use downvotes simply for not agreeing with an opinion.

To give you a better idea of how the show would have turned out, take a look at [**the ""Leekly Bible""**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unmade_Doctor_Who_serials_and_films#1990s_US_reboot_-_Leekley_bible) that the lead-writer developed to plan out some episodes for the series.

Now while Amblin did not end up liking his pitch (which involved getting the Doctor's father involved) and he was not kept on as lead writer, but his bible would have doubtlessly had a lot of impact on the show.

Plots included the Doctor visiting London during the blitz (as he did in **The Empty Child/Doctor Dances** and **Victory of the Daleks**), a trip to Ancient Egypt, a team-up with Blackbeard, and a visit to Skaro (where the Daleks are ""just being created"").

There were also several ""remakes"" that they'd be making, including:

* **The Talons of Weng-Chiang**, set in New York

* **The Celestial Toymaker**, who was to have been under the control of the Master.

* An episode called **Don't Shoot, I'm the Doctor**, a more historically accurate remake of **The Gunfighters**

* **The Yeti**, a remake of **The Abominable Snowmen** featuring the Dalai Lama and Sir Edmund Hillary

* A remake of **The Ark in Space**

* A remake of **The Sea Devils**, set in a Louisiana oil rig

* **The Land of Fear**, a conflation of **The Reign of Terror** and **The Claws of Axos**

* A remake of **The Dæmons**, set in Salem, Massachusetts

* A completed version of **Shada**, which would have introduced Romana and Professor Chronotis as Romana's uncle.

He also had several ideas in general for the show, including a redesigned version of the Cybermen called ""Cybs"" that were more ""piratical"" than robotic. The Master would also be a very frequent villain.

There are also several other possible ""What Ifs"" about this series, including Speilberg himself directing the pilot and anyone from Tom Hanks to Jim Carrey to play the Doctor himself.

So far, the most popular theory seems to be that the Doctor will meet her at an earlier time and/or rescue her from being blown up along with the asylum.

This seems unlikely as:

* That's already the storyline River's been given.
* Why would the Doctor either travel with someone he knows he'll have to take back to their death (note that he doesn't travel with River - she just keeps turning up), or bother to change time for this one person when he hasn't for all the others who've died (and thus undoing the Dalek memory loss)?
* Oswin's full name is Oswin Oswald. The companion is named Clara. They are *different people*.

I think even the most die-hard Moffat critic would admit that he'd be a colossal moron to reuse something from the last two series.

This means she is also not:

* A ganger clone.
* A Teselecta pretending to be a Dalek (???)
* A Timelord (or just ""Timelord-esque"")

About the only original idea I've seen is her reappearing as a Dalek and using a perception filter to appear human. Bust as interesting/bizarre as that would be, it seems pretty unlikely. And it still doesn't explain the change of name.

---

I'll admit that I have no better suggestion (the best I've managed is ""quantum entanglement, something something...""), but I at least know that it won't be any of these options.

There's a few things I think are important:

* The Doctor never saw Oswin in human form, only heard her. Only the audience knows that her and Clara are the same.
* Moffat has said [that the Ponds leaving will be ""tragic"", that this will ""change"" the Doctor (making him darker), and that there's a *reason* he takes on this new companion. ""I liked Oswin"" is not good enough](/spoiler).
* Oswin's ""remember"" line and look to the audience. Is this purely ""only you've seen me, and you know you'll be seeing me again""? Or is Who about to go a bit meta (I am imagining a Deadpool-esque assistant)?
* I think that the Dalek memory loss is the crux of why any ""changing time"" theory doesn't pan out. The Doctor wants this, and Moffat did it deliberately. I don't think either of them would plan to undo it.

Sometimes I enjoy those episodes, and I know it's a big rift here -- whether these unconnected standalones post the Ponds are better or not -- but either way, I like it when stuff matters....the Doctor doesn't just pull a rabbit out of his hat (often on accident) or never really show a ton of concern about what's happening on screen.

I just wanted it to be it's own thread. I've always believed that in his room, he saw that River was there, and realized that she was his killer.

At this point we only know that the Doctor knows when and where he is going to die, and this is him finding out who, but not necessarily why. That is why he can respond in The Wedding saying ""hello, River."" knowing it would be her. 

When he says ""who else?"" he was confirming his suspicion that her stopping his death in Lets Kill Hitler was too easy, and he figured the Silence would use her once again. And who else would finally fully kill him but the Woman raised to do just that. 

At this point he knew that she was in Stormcage for murder, and he knew that if she was done exactly as she was programmed she wouldn't have been able to live with herself whenever she met him in her future but his past (ie Byzatium) So he knew he probably finds a way out of it. 

As he goes on his farewell tour he is searching as to why he needs to die, but also how he can keep himself from dying. So by the point when he meets with Craig in Closing Time, he is still fighting back, but by the end of the episode he knows the fixed point is nearing. By the beginning of the Wedding of River Song, he is resilient and trying to fight back, but with the Death of the Brigadier, he knows it's his time and basically gives up fighting death. 

UNTIL! he delivers the letters to the Tessalecta and suddenly remembers the full capabilities of the machine. The Doctor's mind turns and his loophole is found. He ""dressed for the occasion"" and he survived.

Anyways thats my theory solving the mystery of the room and how it ties everything back together.

I work in a Korean middle school and am currently re-watching a lot of Series 4 with my students (who have never heard of Dr Who but go funking mental for it like you wouldn't believe). Recently we watched Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead and it struck me how super depressing River's death and and the Dr's 'saving' her is, especially for a woman who is appears so strong and independent. Here are my reasons:

1) The library has been sealed for 100 years since the Vashta Nerada (sp?) hatched but Charlotte hasn't aged at all, in the node or in the virtual world. Presumably that this means that River and the others won't age either. Does this mean that they're stuck there indefinitely, for eternity, or until the computer fails? That's pretty depressing in itself. The library's lightbulbs will burn out the sun, will the computer do the same? Bloody hell, that's a long time.

2) This whole plan was kept a secret from her (fair enough, spoilers and whatnot) so she has absolutely no say in whether or not she wanted to be resurrected. The Dr had years and years to plan his supposed rescue of her, couldn't he have played 'Would You Rather?' at some point just to make sure she wouldn't prefer to go out in a blaze of glory?

3) Everything seems to suggest that the Dr is the absolute most important thing in River's life, so perhaps an eternity without him is more punishment than happy ending...especially when she knows that he's the one who signed her up for it.

4) She's totally aware before she sacrifices herself that the Library patrons are trapped inside a virtual world overseen by CAL and the Dr Moon, so she knows full well that her new life isn't real..but she has no choice other than to live it anyway. Forever, presumably, as mentioned earlier.
5) Charlotte Lux thought she might be lonely, so she resurrected her work colleagues to hang out with. Would you want to spend eternity with your workmates??

6) If I remember rightly, River is telling the bedtime story of the Dr to Charlotte (which is fine) and two other children (which is less fine). These kids are the same as Donna's were, copy and pasted lines of code...why are they there at all, and isn't that a bit creepy?

7) River Song just doesn't seem like the kind of woman who would want to spend forever looking after 3 children in a lovely white dress, knowing that nothing she does will ever make a difference to the real world. She's a super cool gun-toting action woman and it seems to me that placing her in a fabricated world (one more time, FOREVER) is unfair, cruel and completely against what her character would want. Whenever I see her in a later episode I can't help but be sad.

8) There are loads more reasons why I don't like this ending but I won't go on and on. 

What do other people think? I'd love to hear a positive spin on the ending so that I could feel better about it!

PS: I've only seen the Matt Smith episodes once each, so if I've missed a crucial line or bit of plot explaining this then please forgive my foolishness.

""Labour camps, that's what they called them last time""- Wilf in Turn Left

""Goodbye Susan, goodbye my dear""

""I owe it to my friend to try because I got her into this, so you see I'm not going to let you stop me now!""- from possibly the greatest Doctor Who cliffhanger in ep3 of Caves of Androzani.

Probably the only thing it was missing was the gratuitous use of newscasters.

He didn’t get enough chance to flesh out his interpretation of the character, and 2. We could get a proper Eight to Nine regeneration scene, finally. (Almost the exact same arguments can be marshaled for Chris Eccleston’s participation in the 50th anniversary) Like I said, I haven’t seen these sentiments around quite as much lately, but the topic has been on my mind enough that I wanted to give my arguments against these things.

My main argument against showing anything to do with the Time War is pretty conventional – it could never live up to our expectations, and is much better used by letting the audience imagine whatever grand, horrifying thing they want. Show don’t tell is one of those cardinal rules that writers are supposed to follow, but in this case I think we keep the mystery going by telling only a little and showing nothing at all. It’s like the shark in *Jaws* or the alien in *Alien*, it’s all the more impressive for only getting little peeks at what it is, never the thing itself. But even more so. For anyone who follows *Sherlock* (and I suspect that may be a respectable number of people here), that was one of my complaints with the treatment of [Sherlock Spoiler](#s *The Hounds of Baskerville*, the poorly-done CGI dog at the end. It would’ve been much more effective to keep the dog entirely offscreen and not show us what the characters were hallucinating. So think of the Time War like the dog, except on a much larger scale.) Alternately, think of another great galactic war – the Clone War. Think about how it felt to hear about that almost mythic history in *A New Hope* and then compare that feeling with how you felt watching *Attack of the Clones*. There’s the argument that if only it had been done *right* or at least done *better* everything would’ve worked out… but there’s still the argument that they could’ve just not shown it at all and left it up to the audience’s imaginations.

So that’s my case against the Time War. But even supposing we could be permitted just a peek into the final moments of the war, maybe even just following the Doctor’s actions that ended it and his regeneration from Eight to Nine. That would be all right, wouldn’t it? I still think no, but for different reasons.

To begin with, is it necessary for us to see Paul McGann regenerate into Chris Eccleston? In almost every instance when regeneration has occurred, the former Doctor has handed the role off to the new Doctor. But the key word is “almost,” since it didn’t happen that way in at least three instances. Working backwards, we have Eight to Nine, but also Six to Seven (in which a regeneration scene was filmed, but it’s not Colin Baker turning into Sylvester McCoy), and Two to Three.

The lack of continuity between the Second and Third Doctors is probably the most relevant instance for this argument. Does anyone feel cheated that we didn’t get to see Troughton become Pertwee onscreen? Or, for that matter, if we could go back and film such a sequence, would it make a difference? Those aren’t just rhetorical questions – if there actually are people upset over the non-existence of this scene, I don’t know of them but would like to. But I think that the regeneration of Seven to Eight is also relevant here. In a nice nod to the classic series and incumbent Doctor, McCoy got invited back to do the first ten or fifteen minutes of the movie and then hand things off to McGann. It was a nice gesture, but I’d argue that it didn’t add enough to be worth it other than for sentimental reasons. If anything, I expect that it would’ve confused audiences unfamiliar with the show – the main character dies in the first ten or fifteen minutes, after all! It’s literally meeting the Doctor just before he dies and regenerates – “What just happened?” is the much more pressing question of “What happens now?” for people unfamiliar with how Time Lords work, whether that’s within the show or people unfamiliar with the show watching it.

So along similar lines, bringing McGann and Eccleston both back to film a regeneration sequence would be sentimental, but not much else in my opinion. I have no doubt that it could be done better today than how the regeneration of McCoy to McGann was handled, but still feel it’s not necessary for the same reason it’s not necessary to have seen Troughton become Pertwee. What would it add?

What it would add, I suppose, could be a real cementing of the characters. Final moments are important, because almost nobody wastes their final moments doing something frivolous – no, you do what’s important to you, and so showing off a regeneration scene would be that memorable last impression of that particular incarnation of the Doctor. Sort of how people love the “You were fantastic… and you know what? So was I” speech by the Ninth Doctor at the end of his run.

However, I’m going to present one last argument against showing the Eighth Doctor regenerate into the Ninth. I don’t think this is a trump argument, or even necessarily a very good one. But it’s one that I particularly like, and why I think it’s aesthetically appropriate not to show the regeneration.

In “The Forgotten” (comic; haven’t read, but have read about), the Tenth Doctor tells his companion that when the Eighth Doctor died, he died alone. Although having the Doctor say this in a comic book isn’t as “this is definitely how it happened” as it would be for him to say it onscreen, it’s good enough for me. Now, this is a bit of a jump, but think about the episode *Blink* for a minute. Of the many things that made that particular episode brilliant, how the camera was used was one of the most brilliant. The Angels can’t move if someone is looking, and even if none of the characters were looking, *the camera was still looking*! It’s also part of why the Angels’ return in *Flesh and Stone/The Time of Angels* was derided, because something about seeing the Angels move on-camera was just wrong. It’s that little meta-nod to the audience, that small acknowledging of our presence. It’s the same thing for Oswin/Clara looking to the camera just before she dies and saying “Remember me.” She’s telling the Doctor to remember her, sure, but it’s also very purposely done that she’s looking directly to the audience and saying it – we’re supposed to remember her too!

So jumping back to how this relates to the Eighth Doctor’s regeneration into the Ninth, there’s something sad and poetic about the Doctor being alone at the end of that life. And my thinking is that perhaps there’s something sad and poetic and also meta about letting the Doctor be truly alone in this instance of regeneration, with not even the camera and the audience to witness it.

So! Those are my arguments. What do people think? Have I missed something or do you have an answer for any of the questions I posed? What could be a good reason for needing to see the regeneration sequence from Eight to Nine?",DISCUSSION,False,,t5_2tf29,1364088123.0,h,,True,t3_1716op,http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/1716op/regenerating_the_eighth_doctor_an_argument_against/,

[Link to trailer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1KRHlh-pRU&amp;list=FLFIMQkZUiXRUsriPy8ehzZg&amp;feature=mh_lolz)

We've got three officially-released episode titles thus far:
    
    7.10 - The Crimson Horror

    7.11 - Journey to the Center of the TARDIS

    7.13 - The Last Cyberman 

Based on casting for the role of a ""Captain"" in 7.8, we can pretty confidently say that scenes from this episode are in the preview trailer:

* 7.8 - Doctor-on-a-boat episode - [The Captain](http://i.imgur.com/8k27F.jpg) / [Another] (http://i.imgur.com/qbZKu.jpg)

That leaves four more total mystery episodes, and gives us a start in determining which clips came from where. Now let's see what else we can get from that trailer.

I've tried to chunk up scenes as best I can, based mostly off scenery and wardrobe, but I'm sure you fellow Whovians can one-up me in some areas, particularly with the ""Mystery"" portion. There's also no guarantee we've seen bits from everything; in fact, there's no real way to know how many episodes are actually sampled in this trailer. But we've got four months to kill, so we may as well try! [Link to full album.](http://imgur.com/a/7DHB6#0)

I'm thinking maybe Journey to the Center of the TARDIS for this one?

* Mystery #2 -  [Big crystal apparatus](http://i.imgur.com/IqSek.jpg) / [strap-on edition](http://i.imgur.com/1k4sV.jpg)

I feel that the Cybermen incident may occur at a different time / in a different episode than the other ""red collar"" scenes, considering the variation in technology, but without seeing that badge (and is that the UNIT eagle?) I can't say for sure.

After seeing all of the BBC clips, I realized the radio clip where Clara says she is everywhere at once and the images of her in different companion's outfits/times are all too reminiscent of the Fourth Doctor serial City of Death, and I think we are going to see that the episode is making a big meta Classic reference, as City of Death is one of the most popular Classic episodes (if not the absolute most).

In the episode, Scaroth was fractured throughout time much like it seems Clara is and will be after tomorrow. He experiences all of his selves at once, just like Clara (according to the radio clip). They each work coopertively, leading humanity to it's future. As Clara says, she was born to ""save the Doctor"", and like the Scaroth, she is leading him to his future.

In City of Death, they end the serial at where it all begins - the Jagaroth ship. At this point, Scaroth becomes fractured in time, and this point catalyzed everything that happened in serial up until that scene. It sounds like this will be happening at Trenzalore tomorrow - Clara is going to be split throughout time in the the finale of Season 7, and we have seen the results throughout the season.

Matt Smith mentioned that paintings were important for the 50th, so this may be a lead up to that. In City of Death, the painting were the essential bridge from the past to the future. Might something happen in this episode which requires a bridge?

So, the theory. I once posted that I thought that everything we saw involving Clara pre-TBOSJ may have been a result of her becoming the Doctor's companion in TBOSJ. People don't normally show up across space and time multiple times. However, as we've seen a lot in New Who, ordinary people can become extraordinary when traveling with the Doctor. 

Clara has saved the day in nearly every episode she has been in. In the finale, she's going to warn the Doctor after receiving an impossible conference call - it is obvious that this impossible call is going to be a call from herself. 

Time in DW isn't linear, so some events could occur next season which ultimately directly the events this season. Why is that important? The Clara's all throughout time could be a result of something that happens to her while adventuring with the Doctor in the future (in reference to the Doctor and Clara's current time line). Why and how has she met the Doctor more than 3 times? I think Clara was sent throughout time to aid him and warn him to prevent something from happening in his future (something that Clara must have been present for). She is simultaneously throughout all of time, much like Bad Wolf, thus the essence which is Clara has met the Doctor any number of times. She could meet future Doctors and past Doctors, but for some reason, the Doctor can't remember.

Think about the repeated phrase - ""Run you clever boy, and remember"". Remember what? We've been assuming she means her remember her. What if there is a message the Doctor needs to remember? What if the Doctor has run into Clara are far more times than he can remember? And why run? While in AOTD it is clear he should run, it isn't in The Snowmen, and it's out of context in TBOSJ. The message has a meaning, and I think she's trying to get him to run from something, to save himself, and it will only occur if he remembers something he has forgotten.

Moffat says the Doctor needs to be saved. I think Clara is the one saving him, by pushing herself throughout all of space and time to be exactly where he needs her to be.

EDIT: Is it possible that in the 50th, the Bad Wolf (aka Rose) is the one to send Clara across time? We know there are tons of Rose references, and a very specific Wolf reference in Cold War. I really was hoping this wasn't the case, but it really makes a lot of sense. This would tie the theory into the 50th. I'm not sure if this makes me happy or not.

Maybe he has his own ""companion"" and she's wearing the Fourth Doctor's scarf for a darker reason than suspected.

Maybe it's not Smith getting Gumped into the old footage. Maybe it's Hurt. And a Time Lord-killing elephant gun macguffin of some kind. The reason it's only Rose, Ten, and Eleven in the 50th is because they're the only ones left. Hell, maybe Ten gets offed a little early.

Surely there's some kind of TARDIS-y and/or timey-whatever reason someone could kill off the Doctors in order.

1346115198.0,69,self.gallifrey,yxnxe,I Met Sylvester McCoy,78,9,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/yxnxe/i_met_sylvester_mccoy/,"I met him in the kitchen of my aunt and uncle’s house. He walked through the door with my uncle and two other guests.  He wore a dark blue pinstriped jacket with a handkerchief in the pocket, light blue shirt, slacks, white socks, brown lace-up shoes and a black cane with a silver handle. Sylvester McCoy is as tall as I am. I'm round about 5’3”, 1.6 m.

The man shook all our hands and boy did I put a lot of focus into doing it correctly. More people turned up than we expected. Word got out about McCoy and we had approx.. 20 people. We all sat in the living room, McCoy in a large chair, and he proceeded to tell us all kinds of stories.

The man is down-to-earth, friendly and very funny. And not just jokes he’s probably told again and again. He’s quick and sharp. I (and others) got to ask him a few questions which I’ll do in Q &amp; A format, they weren’t asked in this order.

**What do you know about the 50th anniversary?** Apparently he knows nothing other than what’s already been made public. I asked for the sake of you guys, but I expected as much.

**Did you watch Doctor Who as a kid?** Yes, McCoy watched Patrick Troughton’s run, all the original episodes before they were destroyed. I remarked about that in awe, he joked about opening up his head and giving them to me. He watched up to part of Tom Baker’s run, but he got busier.

**What is the Minister of Chance?** A special “sequel” to the first audio drama, Death Comes to Time. The first featured the 7th Doctor, but this second one isn’t Doctor Who, but more like Doctor Who meets Lord of the Rings. Featuring McCoy, McGann and other names McCoy promised me were well known to British people.

**How did you get into acting?** McCoy had always been good at doing physical tricks and gimmicks. People always told him he had a knack for it, and if he hadn’t been interested in becoming a monk (gee like Tom Baker) he would’ve done acting. During a series of odd jobs McCoy joined up with the hippies. They were looking for someone to count tickets at the booth- or someone who *could* count, and that happened to be McCoy. He became friends with another actor who sometimes ran the booth. When the actor’s director came around asking if the man knew anyone who could play a real crazy character, he referred McCoy.

**How do you choose your roles?** McCoy lives his life by saying “Yes,” so he was always flattered to even be asked, and he so he said yes.

**What about the Hobbit?** Well I am sworn to secrecy on divulging the behind-the-scenes of filming the Hobbit itself, but McCoy had a fun time round the place they stayed. It was a small town, basically a crossroad really, with a name that resembled a sound effect more than it did a word. *Plee-oo plee-oo!*  And there the locals were paid to let the actors and crew to stay in their houses for the duration of filming. McCoy’s house was a small thing at the top of a hill; its occupants were on vacation. All he had for company was a cat. He told us about how he went down and hitchhiked to the bar. A man with a thin yet extremely long beard picked him up and before McCoy could enter the bar, it turns out people had been freaking out because they couldn’t find him. Crew members and set people had been running all over. *Get the helicopter!*

Originally The Hobbit was planned on being split into two parts, but according McCoy, Jackson had so much extra stuff they decided to expand it. So after McCoy heads to the University of Oklahoma (to speak to a theater class) he’s heading back to New Zealand to finish up some scenes.

**In General** McCoy talked about how he met my uncle- at a horror convention, making different accents, about growing up and living most his life in London (current residence), how Big Finish audios now air on the radio (something Americans don’t really do anymore, dramas that is).
I told McCoy about how I got into the radio dramas because I was interested in Davros. He said to me, “Oh my greatest enemy!” And I replied, “Exactly! That’s why Remembrance of the Daleks is my favorite. Favorite Doctor, favorite villain.” In response to my flattery, “Oh, well that makes up for it!”

 What’s best- he played the spoons and a song for us and then graciously **signed a bunch of photos and took pictures with us.**

At this point I was the center of attention. Modesty aside, I was recognizably the biggest Whovian in the room (and the youngest person by a few decades!). I brought out my pictures of myself and my ½ scale Dalek. Everybody in the room had a look round at my Dalek. McCoy’s eyebrows raised, he joked that baby Daleks were all fun but it’s when they grow up that one needs to watch out. He signed one for myself and one for my dad. Then he signed my Remembrance of the Daleks DVD and a picture for a friend. With all this new hullaballoo and fandom I started to freak out a bit but I was doing pretty good.

**But here’s my favorite part**. I stood up next to McCoy for a picture, arm around my shoulder. I was looking straight ahead, breaming from ear to ear, ecstatic that this was actually happening. I was holding it together nicely enough. But right before the picture was taken, I heard Sylvester McCoy’s voice in my right ear. In a near whisper and low voice like that of the Doctor’s I heard him say: *""TARDIS.""*

And I lost it. The camera flashed and now I have a picture of my stupid face all scrunched up funny because I doubled over right after the picture, trying to not die from the awesome. Seriously, that voice was right up in my ear. I wish I could’ve seen the look on his face- he totally did that to me on purpose. I quickly straightened up for a second picture with him and my dad, got permission to post the video, said thank you and left. Along with everyone else, including McCoy. It was 9pm.

Recently in *Journey to the Centre of the TARDIS* we saw The Doctor make a personal delivery of an artifact because the previous attempt to deliver the BFB didn't succeed, if ""previous"" means anything with respect to time travel.


Both these seem examples of ""Ground Hog Day"" style time loops that are only broken when an unsatisfactory outcome serves as a lesson to The Doctor to change his method

It raises these questions in my mind:
(1) Was there a ""first iteration"" of Forest of the Dead where the Doctor didn't give River the screwdriver, and so she was really, properly lost. This is the model suggested by *Journey to the Centre of the TARDIS*. We saw the BFB first arrive without explicit instruction at the start of the episode, then a different (successful) approach at the end.

(2) or does the Doctor always give River a hacked sonic screwdriver? I.e. the knowledge to save River's ""matrix"" is always applied and he never experienced the permanent loss associated with her sacrifice?



The reason I ask for your opinion is that there is something very sad about the idea that there is a time stream that The Doctor may remember where he doesn't save River. If this first iteration of the sequence ends without River being saved then The Doctor will have actually seen her sacrifice herself to save the day.

What do you think happened first time around? Did River turn up without a screwdriver? How would the first iteration of the story been affected?

Oh - and how is River's diary in the data core for her to read again?

Oh - and is this the first reference to the Doctor and companions always  *running*?

Now, I'll say from right here that I may be wrong, for all I know some of those straws are right and ALL of the old Doctors are in the ep. But as it stands every Doctor bar Tennant and Smith have said outright that they have not been approached. 

This does **not** mean that the 50th won't be special, it doesn't mean it will be bad. Yes, there have been multi Doctor stories as milestones in the past but that doesn't mean that every milestone needs one nor does it mean that if they made a multi Doctor story that it would be good.

The only thing that a lot of us are setting ourselves up for at the moment is disappointment as we're telling ourselves that the only way for it to be the true and great 50th is for it to be X.

If you set yourselves thinking that you're getting a Matt Smith special with a David Tennant cameo and lots of nods to the old Doctors I think we'll be fine and any extras will be amazing but at the moment I don't see how anything we will get is going to satisfy what most people seem to be building it up to ""NEED"" to be.

After watching the show for a while, it's easy to become desensitised to it, but very occasionally, the show will pull off a warped and disturbing death which will give the enemy a real sense of sadism and unrestrainability.

So the question for you all is this: **what is the most horrible death you have seen in *Doctor Who*?** 

For me, there is one death in particular which deeply shocked me.

This would be the execution of the nameless old man in the Seventh Doctor's episode 'The Happiness Patrol'. For those who haven't made it to the classics yet, the death is as follows: the man is placed on a platform to be executed by a firing squad; the squad is dismissed so that he is tricked into believing he has been spared; and finally, the man is sealed in a metal pipe which is filled with a thick, boiling solution of melted candy mixture, drowning the man (and most likely melting some insides too). This was a very shocking death because of three things: the lack of dignity, the pain involved, and the sadistic mind behind it all. 

Helen A. was a brillaint villainess and the delight she showed in the execution really showed the superficiality of her emotion. In trying to create a happy society, she had created something cheap, something which was only happy on the surface. In a world or tacky buildings, bright obtrusive colours and seriously *annoying* lift music, the only happiness was that shown out of fear and repression.

Sadly, 'The Happiness Patrol' is often derided by fans, who call it childish and camp. Admittedly, it's a little over the top, but it's supposed to be. With the painful deaths and merciless repression combined with the childlike imagery of the Kandyman, you actually have a very dark story at core, full of political imagery and warped ideas. 

But meh, ramblings. I can't articulate it very well. I want to know what you think.

Her duty was/is to save the Doctor. She saved the Doctor from the Daleks, she saved the Doctor from the Ice Lady. Perhaps she'll save the Doctor several more times, not as herself, but occupying companions through space and time.

It's like two opposite forces at work trying to either make the Doctor forget or remember (Run you clever boy and...) with two pawns: River and Clara.

The goal of this is to hopefully curtail and minimize the effects of bandwagon voting, both positive and negative. Highly voted, or lowly voted, comments tend to illicit a knee-jerk vote from people, subconsciously suggesting that the post is better or worse simply because of its score. We know that's not necessarily the case, but it is true that a top comment after the first hour is likely to remain the top comment for the duration of the post, whether higher quality submissions come in after it or not.

As opposed to 'contest mode' which randomized the sorting and obscured child comments, hiding the vote score will not affect the sorting and child comments will continue to be displayed as usual. The difference now is net vote difference between submissions will not be visible until the time limit is up, at which point the scores for those comments will appear.

Ideally this will level the playing field for the first little while of the post few new comments being submitted, and will hopefully discourage piggybacking on top votes for karma or weaker comment making it to the top just because it was there first. Now a comment will more likely be voted on based on its merit and appeal to each user, rather than having its public perception influence its votes.

The scores may be hidden anywhere from 1 minute to 24 hours, the current time for this subreddit is set for 3 hours. It can be tweaked as necessary, which we will likely have to do. Saturday when the newest episode airs we should hopefully have a better idea of a time period to use.

Sorting follows how you have it selected (new/controversial/best/top), only the counts are hidden.

Unfortunately it's not like the CSS where a user can elect not to apply if if they dislike it, it's a feature of the whole subreddit. It is RES-compatible, meaning that even with RES it still obscures the vote count and spread until the time limit is up. All mobile apps should be effected by in the same way, their display may differ slightly until they catch up to adding a '[score hidden]' type message.

After watching the scene in which The Doctor talks to the giant parasite god a few hundred times, the quote from The God Complex (above) came to my mind. Did anyone else feel like The Doctor was relating himself to the parasite? He is very frightened and doesn't know what to do for a second then he gets the idea of giving his memories. Because he thinks those memories can take down such a creature, just like those memories are making him hurt all the time - and perhaps will be the end of him. I think especially this quote (below) fits The Doctor quite a bit.

Now while this could obviously be a classic case of one's mind slipping after who knows how many centuries of travel, I pause to wonder whether this will lead into something a tiny bit larger.

You see, ""The Web of Fear"" and ""The Abominable Snowmen"" are most well known for being one of the many episodes tragically lost when the BBC decided to clear house on its films. The only way to have known about these stories is through reconstructions or novelizations.

I can understand a really obscure reference being tossed in now and again, but this was a central plot-point. A blatant reference, a key reference even, to something so wholly obscure that even Classic Who aficionados would have to rush to a wiki to sort it all out.

So what's the deal? Well, I posit (and mind you this is a very, *very* early speculation) that the missing adventures of Doctor Who are somehow missing from the Doctor as well.

Be it the Silence, more cracks, or something else entirely I posit that those adventures are just as lost to us as they are to him, with only vague and distorted parts remaining in his mind. 

Now I understand this is a pretty hard knock against the fourth wall, but seeing as they said ""Doctor Who"" six bloody times this special I can see this perhaps being in the realm of possibility.

As a amateur storyteller myself, I'm going to explain his purpose. First of all, he was in a cold open. Often, cold opens teasingly introduce the threat and in most crime and sci-fi shows, someone dies. That's what happens here. But not just that. He goes to the Winter Quay, meets an older version of himself and promptly gets sent back by Angels. This is *exactly* what happens to Rory later, so when you get the sense of what will happen to Rory later in the episode it sends chills up your spine. It's a storytelling device, almost a sort of foreshadowing.

Also, we see River typing her book during the opening. She is later seen working with detectives. The cold open also introduces the noir feel. It sets the stage, as cold opens are supposed to.

And concerning the specifics of the Doctor going back to get Amy and Rory: Gillan wanted to leave the show permanately but in a happy way. It essentially boils down to that production reason. And besides, the Doctor could go back and get a lot of his companions from the classic series who left with less of a send-off, but he doesn't.

As I've mentioned earlier (right [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/10oex1/episode_discussion_thread_s07e05_the_angels_take/c6fdhuu here)), getting caught up with the little story elements and trying to keep a consistency (seroiusly, there hasn't been one for a while, and deux ex machinas and pseudo-science explanations have been prevalent since the reboot) ruins the overall point of the story. Getting caught up in the technicalities isn't what the show is about. It's about a crazy alien who explores time and space and manages to save the day without much of a plan. Anything can happen. To question some of the minor points and let that get in the way of the enjoyment of the episode would ruin the spirit of the show.

EDIT: I think I'd like to mention that I tend to be more of a character than plot person. (I'm pleased in the direction this is going with the character of the Doctor, for instance, and how this will be explored with the new companion). So I may not quite view this as everyone here does. ""The Big Bang"" and ""A Christmas Carol"" are two of my favorite episodes, and while I agree mostly with the time travel in ""The Big Bang"" and not ""A Christmas Carol"", I love both for their storytelling power.

Also, I haven't found an episode from the new series that I just have downright hated. I've found there are ways of appreciating just about everything (and I didn't hate ""Fear Her"" or ""Love &amp; Monsters"" the first time around either).

There are a few reasons this is concerning to our small subreddit.

1 - These are happening on self-posts that are opinions/discussions. If you don't agree with an opinion you shouldn't be downvoting it. It goes against [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/help/reddiquette) and discourages open dialog. 

2 - As a smaller subreddit downvotes pull the topic off peoples front page quicker because of the low upvote count. Two posts were made in the last two days that didn't show up on our front page because of just one or two downvotes.  Both these posts got people talking, there was no reason for them to be dropped from people seeing them.

3 - Some might be thinking it's reddits algorithm adding downvotes but these have been happening more often and too quickly lately. And its not just one or two downvotes.

Here is an example of what I mean. 

http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/w7d2i/just_started_new_who_amy_discussion/

There was no reason to downvote this post except for disagreeing with the topic.  It's someone's opinion, it generated a good discussion and that's just what this subreddit is supposed to be about. Yet it was downvoted below zero. This is not good.

4 - And this is my biggest concern. Downvoting posts because you don't agree or don't find the topic interesting is going to start discouraging people from posting. 

I hope this doesn't come across too rude but I want to get it out. This sub isn't elite, we aren't the special group that has their secret place to hang out. This sub was created to talk about Doctor Who, a place for people to be comfortable discussing this great show without the imgur posts. I want everyone here to feel welcome to comment and post. 

I am making this post today in hopes that it will help. There is the option to remove downvoting from this subreddit but we don't want to go there if we don't need to. 

Please just help make people feel at home here no matter if you disagree with their opinions. Let's make people feel comfortable making posts.

When Rose and Nine came back and found out Mickey had been tried for her murder, I got a little protective. And then every subsequent encounter it just seemed like Mickey was treated awfully by both main characters, Rose or whichever Doctor (Rose was offended when Mickey went out with another woman even though she'd been missing for over a year with no particular indication that she would ever return, for example, or the Doctor comparing Mickey to a big dumb horse for comedic effect). But the weirder thing was that the show wasn't even making any point about it. It was like they didn't expect that stuff to interfere with my respect for the main characters at all. That was the most unusual and morally offensive part of it, to me. They were always mocking him, mostly for absurd stuff like not being an experienced time traveler. And though I was quite pleased with his ending and how Mickey sort of ""comes into his own"", that sort of confidence really should not be necessary for you to treat someone with a little decency, particularly if you happen to be in the act of slowly stealing his girlfriend (if you'll forgive the sexist language there).

Later we see a lot of these same tropes with Rory. The difference being, he eventually becomes a protagonist, and yet there are few consequences of Eleven's mocking treatment of Rory, or the show's. The initial episodes make fun of Rory, for his looks and his lack of confidence, and that is a bit cruel -- to have that character later become so central makes the early appearances even more cringe-inducing.

We do hear more about the Doctor's treatment of Martha. But to be fair, that's because he treated her horribly. You know when he fixed her cellphone to recieve calls from Earth? 42. He does that for Rose at the beginning of the second episode. He even notices himself that he regularly takes Martha for granted (e.g. Gridlock), but seems to forget it just as quickly. In the Lazarus episode, she insists on being upgraded from ""passenger"" to ""companion"" if she comes on more adventures, and is so ready for rejection that she sees it when it isn't even there. There are the well-known examples of Martha ""getting a job"" to support the Doctor in Blink (mentioned only in passing) and the Doctor subjecting her to bigotry and prejudice (including his own, ugh) in the Human Nature double-ep (neat fact about those episodes -- humanity is the bad guy. After I realized that they made way more sense. I could do a whole other post on this but brevity wit etc). Not to mention the finale. But really, those larger issues bother me less than the smaller ways he shows his lack of consideration for her, that he simply doesn't put much thought into her well-being beyond basic safety. 

I'm going to go ahead and include the Ood here. Include the Ood. Incluuuuude the Oooooood. Okay I'm done. The first time we see them, they get summarily destroyed and we're not given any particular cues to feel bad about it, which I found slightly disturbing. Then later they make a return, and Donna calls the Doctor out on that very issue, which I find very telling (yeah okay I love Donna).

OKAY so, my issue is not with the Doctor's treatment of these people (and yes I do have to point out that two of the three are black, classy as always) because he is fallible, and sometimes, a douche. My problem is that it never really gets addressed, or warned against, or comes back to bite him in the ass in some clever way, or any of the other things that usually happen to the hero when he's a jackass. And it's not even presented as something worthy of negative consequences, which I find a bit surreal (I think the term for it might be moral dissonance?) on a show I can usually relate to. So...

All the actual people the Angels ""killed"" by sending them back in time turned out (as far as we know) to be happy, didn't they? At least in Blink and Angels Take Manhattan.

Sally Sparrow's friend fell in love and grew old with someone special. The guy she was flirting with did the same. After Rory was sent back to that specific point in time, the Angel could have sent Amy anywhere, but it chose to send her to be with Rory.

They seem like merciful killers. Like they do what they have to in order to survive but by and large any suffering they create is a side effect not a goal.

In other words, while both are ""big scary monsters,"" they're almost the complete opposite of the Daleks. Daleks seem to enjoy *being in the process of killing something* and do it even though they don't have to. Weeping Angels have to kill and, without going out of their way, generally do the best they can not to cause undue suffering.

They got married because River wouldn't let him go back to the fixed point. You have to understand that River was programed to be obsessed with the Doctor, raised under the sole purpose of killing him however in Lets Kill Hitler her views shift and she realizes that she was used and thus exerts that obsession to love, she doesn't want to kill the Doctor on the beach and so she finds a way to change a fixed point thus endangering all the universe by stopping time just for him.

(The Wedding of River Song) RIVER: It was such a basic mistake, wasn't it, Madame Kovarian? Take a child, raise her into a perfect psychopath, introduce her to the Doctor. Who else was I going to fall in love with?

....... HOWEVER, while River at this point is madly deeply for the Doctor, he is not of the same sentiment yet in their relationship (remember not too long ago on HIS time line he didn't even know who River was) She knows to some degree she will be the woman who marries the Doctor - and the Doctor knows for a fact that in the Library (during his last regeneration, the point in HIS time line he first meets River) she knows his actual name, meaning they are by that point in HER time line married in all sense of the Galifreyan/Timelord meaning for marriage- she knows his true name. So while he knows its inevitable since he and she are in a paradox, he is not ready for that level of commitment yet- after all, still early for their relationship in the timeline, and lets face it- the doctor doesn't do domestic.

RIVER: Am I the woman who marries you, or the woman who murders you?

DOCTOR: Oh! I don't want to marry you.

RIVER: I don't want to murder you.

....... SO by this point the universe if on the brink of falling apart, after all you can't just rewrite fixed points. The Doctor has to save all of time and space and to do that he needs to be able to let River and he touch long enough to start time again and set them back on the beach for her to 'kill' him. How can a man convince a woman who loves him enough to tear apart time itself just to save him to let him 'die'? Marry her!

DOCTOR: River, no-one can help me. A fixed point has been altered, time is disintegrating.

RIVER: I can't let you die.

DOCTOR: But I have to die.

RIVER: Shut up! I can't let you die without knowing you are loved by so many, and so much. And by no-one more than me.

DOCTOR: River, you and I, we know what this means. We are ground zero of an explosion that will engulf all reality. Billions on billions will suffer and die.

RIVER: I'll suffer if I have to kill you.

DOCTOR: More than every living thing in the universe?!

RIVER: Yes.

......... RULE number 1 the doctor lies- so we have this 'wedding' which for in all intents and purposes follows some Galifreyan traditions -the wrapping of the hands with one cloth- assumable representing the joining of one time line and life, and the the act of actually telling your significant other the name you were given when created at the loom. However the Doctor does just enough to make the young river feel like she has 1st made her point clear about her love for him and then 2nd lets her know by not whispering his name but rather having her look in the Tesalector version of his eye to show that he the Real Doctor is safe inside so she wont be killing him by starting time again, and 3rd without her knowing since he doesn't share his name, they are not Really married (at least not yet in the series since we do know for a fact they do finalize tying the knot since River in the library knows his name)

DOCTOR: Now, River, I'm about to whisper something in your ear, and you have to remember it very, very carefully and tell no-one what I said. [The DOCTOR whispers in RIVER’S ear] I just told you my name. Now there you go, River Song. Melody Pond. You're the woman who married me. And wife, I have a request. This world is dying, and it's my fault, and I can't bear it another day. Please, help me. There isn't another way.

They kiss time moves on, the fixed point happens and all is well since the Doctor didn't really die.

So My question- will we get to see this turning point at all with him and River where he really does marry her (since we know as a fixed point he must since she knows his name in the library) and if so how/when do you think it'll happen?

TLDR: The doctor and river don't REALLY get married in 'The Wedding of River Song' it was a Doctor's ruse to get a woman holding the universe's safety hostage for the love of a man and not wanting to kill him. He never gave her his name, therefor not married- will we get to see that turning point/ actual marriage scene? If so when/how?


[[EDIT// Adding supporting evidence that River will know his name and that its tied to marriage]]

""When a good man goes to war"" 

RIVER: (lightly) Oh, look, your cot! Haven't seen that in a very long while. (backs up to the cot)

DOCTOR: No, no, you tell me. Tell me... who you are.

RIVER: (takes his hand) I am telling you. (holds his hand on the cot) Can't you read?

The DOCTOR looks at the Gallifreyan writing on the cot and then up at RIVER. He suddenly realizes who she is and smiles.

DOCTOR: Hello.

RIVER: Hello.

DOCTOR: (laughs nervously) But... but that means...

RIVER: I'm afraid it does.

DOCTOR: (looks at AMY and RORY) Ooh! But you and I, we, we, we, er... (kisses the air)

RIVER: Yes.

.........

This kinda affirms the idea that she knew his name (not just read it off the cot), and the instant connection between name and marriage backs my point that it is part of the ceremony.

However, it's started to bother me that every time we learn something about it, it takes the meaning of the word in a new and sometimes unrelated direction.

Throughout Series 5, silence seemed to be a consequence of people and objects being removed from time and space by the cracks, a physical phenomenon due to the suddenly-altered timeline. If we look at the uses of ""silence"" in Series 5:

""The Pandorica will open. Silence will fall."" - *The Eleventh Hour* (I'll admit there's only a strongly-implied link between these two sentences).

""We ran from the silence""; ""some [cracks] were tiny, some were as big as the sky. Through some we saw worlds and people, and through others we saw silence, and the end of all things.""; the market's sudden silence at the end of the episode - *Vampires of Venice*.

The unseen voice saying ""Silence will fall""; the literal silence as the stars go out - *The Pandorica Opens*.

In Series 5, every time we get more information regarding the silence, it is linked with the cracks. Then, in the last moments of the series, the Doctor says ""the Silence is still out there"", referring to the force behind the TARDIS explosion. As far as I'm aware, before this point there was no hint that ""silence"" referred to anything other than physical silence due to the cracks. How did the Doctor know this? Where did the information come from?

When we get into Series 6, things get more complex. By the end of *The Wedding of River Song*, ""The Silence"" also refers to:

* The memory-proof alien species: ""Silence, Doctor. We are The Silence."" - *Day of the Moon* (I know some people call them The Silents, but this is never confirmed in the the show)

* The religious order that they command: ""The Silence is not a species, it is a religious order or movement."" - *Let's Kill Hitler*

* The Doctor's silence that the religious order desire when The Question is asked at The Fields of Trenzalore: ""'Silence must fall' would be a better translation. The Silence are determined that the question must never be answered."" - *The Wedding Of River Song*

All of these new definitions take our understanding of ""silence"" in new, interesting directions to serve the developing plot but they also get further and further away from the original meaning. My question is: were they all planned in advance? Did Moffat have a master plan when he took over the show or was it made up on the fly?

While there are plenty of extra scenes, these appear to be extras rather than something that was intended for the main episode. The problem is that some of Smith's episodes are crying out due to poor editing. A good example is the curse of the black spot, which a few scenes added would have at least meant that characters that went missing could be explained. Isn't that what a home release supposed to be, chance to not be constrained to the timelimits of the show. If they just added them as a deleted scenes pile fans could edit them back in...

I developed this idea when ruminating on the show's many similarities to the show Avatar The Last Airbender. In this show there is a nearly season-long arc in which the main character Aang is separated from the giant sky-bison Appa who has been his dutiful steed and closest friend throughout the series.

This event radically changed the dynamic of the show and greatly tried the main character. I believe that a similar application to the Doctor and the TARDIS could bring out some equally interesting if not surpassingly entertaining material and would do wonders to really testing the Doctor's character.

You see, the Doctor is and always has been free. He may land on other planets and other times, but he's always an outsider. He may always get involved with some disaster, getting his fingers into some mystery or adventure, but he never truly gets involved with his surroundings and never really attaches him to somewhere.

So much is said of the Doctor being god-like and being lauded as such a powerfully amazing man free from the shackles of space and time but all of that power really is the TARDIS. Alone from that, away from all that which makes him godly, what is the Doctor?

Now this would be no permanent development, the TARDIS being the massive element of the show as it is, but to imagine an arc in which the Doctor has lost and must aimlessly travel the universe in desperate search for his TARDIS is to imagine something truly interesting.

Basically, the idea behind 6b is that, though he begins to regenerate (twice, actually, [once](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/The_War_Games) on screen and [once](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/The_Night_Walkers_%28comic_story%29) in what's now a really, really obscure comic), we never actually see Troughton complete his transformation into Pertwee, and owing to a couple of inconsistencies in some of the multi-Doctor specials, there's evidence that there must have been a gap between the end of *The War Games* and the Third Doctor stumbling out of the TARDIS in *Spearhead from Space*. There's a bunch of extended universe stuff that takes place in this period, with most of it having Two coerced into working for the Celestial Intervention Agency (see what they did there?) from *The Deadly Assassin*. 

It's all a bit arcane, I'll admit, but season 6b has got pretty good official support. Apart from its appearance on the BBC website, Paul Cornell (one of the guys who first made a big deal of the inconsistencies) has been a scriptwriter for the revived series, and Terrence Dicks- the writer of a lot of the Classic episodes the Season 6b theory is based on- has officially [endorsed](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Season_6b#Established_as_narrative_fact) it and used it in some of his Second Doctor Novels. 


So at any rate, we have a gap in the Doctor's timeline between the final on-screen appearance of one doctor and the first appearance of another, in which he was working for a particularly shady and interventionist sector of the Time Lords' intelligence community under threat of forced regeneration.

 HurtDoc could fit in there pretty easily.  He could have been a failed attempt by the Doctor to escape or subvert the CIA (or at least deal with them on his own terms), for instance; a more likely possibility is that he was created by the CIA to do the sort of dirty work that his other incarnations wouldn't have, then fell in battle (with one or more of his other incarnations?) or was killed by the CIA itself when he became more dangerous than useful: he would have been living evidence of their activities that would need to be covered up, after all, and perhaps he took things farther than even his controllers were comfortable with, or went rogue and posed a very real danger to them and/or the universe at large. 

All that said, I'm mostly posting this to lock in gloating rights on the off chance it turn out to be the case- I've got even less invested in it than the [other tentative theory](http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/1eqdbg/finale_and_anniversary_spoilers_could_hurts/) I posted, to the point that I think I'd prefer if it didn't happen. Officially recognized or not, 6b is a pretty damn obscure bit of Whoviana, and without the extended universe stuff (which, IIRC, the BBC isn't supposed to reference too blatantly), the whole thing relies on the nit-picking of throwaway lines from decades ago. It'd require an awful lot of clever writing explain to all but the most attentive fans of Classic Who what the hell is going on and why they should care without bogging down the plot.

This turned out to be correct, proving, once again, that Occam's Razor is usually correct.

However, there were other theories, because there were other clues.

After *Bells of Saint John* and *Rings of Akhaten*, there was a lot of talk about the small details. How Clara's leaf in *Rings* is different from the ones in *Bells*, how there were some ages missing from her edition of *101 Places to See* - and also, how it was likely a different book from the one her mother gave her.

Was that all really just a mummer's farce, or mistakes from the production team? Seems rather anticlimatic. I really believed they wouldn't overlook such important details, like the two leaves being entirely different from one another. But, alas, I don't think they'll be coming back to these small things. Bigger questions have been left unanswered.

Another thing that bugs me is: why did he only see Clara twice before *Bells*, in *Asylum* and *Snowmen*, if she jumped back to all points in his timeline? What was special about these two stories?

The way I see it is, after GI and Clara meddled, every DW story happened three times. Once as we saw them, once with the Doctor getting killed by the GI, and once more with Clara saving him. Thing is, what's so special about those two occasions that the first time we saw them Clara was already there?

And on the times we *didn't* see her - why was she dressed up as the old companions? Is everything retconned now, has every companion become Clara?

There is so much about Clara that is still a mystery. What bugs me is that I believe they'll never come back to explain this stuff. They're already moving on into the next arc - ""who the hell is this John Hurt Doctor?"" - and not really bothering to answer all the questions left by the last one.

This was made by the BBC to promote the modern series. To me, it seems useful to use it to fill in some of our gaps regarding what happened between 8 and 9. For instance:


Steven Hudson
I saw him a couple a years ago outside a new building development in Totters Lane, East London. The guy seemed really confused and keep muttering, ""They’re all gone, I'm the only one left"". The man was either a complete loon or was drunk. Looking back I think he was probably drunk as he looked as if he'd been to a fancy dress party. He was wearing some old Edwardian outfit, not a leather jacket.

The end of the Time War and his regeneration.

j q public
Saw someone who looked like him in a university campus not too long ago. Seemed to be arguing with a little man with an umbrella.

So Nine met Seven!

Dinah May
I saw this man several years ago, dumping some old clothes at the local tip. There was a flute, a velvet jacket and a long scarf. I asked him about them, and he just said he was having a clear out. Then he said he had never really liked cricket either.

He got rid of a lot of his old stuff. Clearly trying to forget his past.

R Spendsmith
I don't know if he's the same bloke but he's the spitting image of a bloke I saw broken down at the side of the road the other day. He was driving some old yellow vintage thing and the AA man was looking well confused.

Yet he's driving Bessie!

Richard J. Kingston
I briefly worked in a private psychiatric institution during the summer of 1962 and I can vividly recall this so called ""Doctor"". He was the last patient to be admitted into our facility. The man was obviously delusional, reckless, and seemed to delight in agitating his fellow inmates. Prior to his arrival, a number of strange “incidents” had stirred up the patients and we, the staff, openly feared a mass breakout attempt. Violent confrontations between the staff and their wards were increasing daily. This “Doctor” only succeeded in making a bad situation worse. We would often find him wandering the corridors or searching through the staff quarters at night, despite the fact that we sedated him and placed him in a securely locked cell after his evening meal each day. How he escaped from him cell and evaded our security guards each night, I will never know. After only one week of incarceration, he vanished. I have no idea how he escaped our hospital, but I often wonder if his escape was somehow connected with the disappearance of our head physician Dr. Sirius Drake, and a mysterious fire that destroyed Dr. Drake’s private quarters and laboratory that same night. We never had time to recapture this “Doctor” - and I never found any answers to my questions - because, a few days later, our institution was ordered to close by the government, and our inmates were transferred to other institutions. I must warn you: Beware this man. Trouble circle him like vultures above a corpse. Do not be fooled by his friendly demeanour. Do not trust him. Do NOT follow him. I say again, beware this “Doctor.”

That's an episode I'd love to see.

As we all know, the Doctor has been getting darker and darker.

The Time Lord Victorious, who 'won' the Time War, has seen the return of the Daleks, as well as wars and insurmountable odds, The Silence, The Cybermen, the deaths of the Ponds, etc.

He lived on a cloud atop Victorian London in isolation, occasionally visiting with the closest thing to friends he has. 

The misery and loneliness of a Timelord is a powerful force, and may eventually lead him to become the Valeyard. The Valeyard was said to occur between his 12th and final incarnation.

Now. Assume for a moment that the Silence are correct, and, in some screwed up morality - right. They intend to stop the Doctor before the fall of the eleventh at the Fields of Trenzalore. 

“On the fields of Trenzalore, at the fall of the eleventh, when no living creature can speak falsely or fail to answer, a Question will be asked, a question that must never, ever be answered.”

I think the answer will be the answer to the ""time lock"", whether its the Doctors name or anything I don't much care. The Silence are attempting to kill the Doctor before the Eleventh (inadvertantly?) unlocks the Time War at his death on Trenzalore. 

Here's an even more insane theory. Trenzalore is on Gallifrey. 

Something to do with Clara allows a breach of the Time Lock. As she appears to be able to die and reappear in a different region of space and time, I don't see any reason she couldn't appear on Gallifrey, either before or during the Time War. 

As the Doctor is chasing her 'signal', as it were, he would be left with an item that existed inside the Time War (ala the white point star). 

The Doctor travels to Gallifrey to save Clara, and ends up at Trenzalore.

The Doctor, and Clara, at Trenzalore. When the Eleventh fell. 

The Valeyard was obviously able to travel to Gallifreys past, as he was there during the time of the sixth Doctor, so either they will ignore his storyline entirely or at some point soon, the time lock will be broken. 

Due to the release of the Time War, the twelfth witnesses the evil created by the release of the insane Time Lords, Daleks, and the other monstrosities of the Time War, and becomes the Valeyard... it'd make a hell of a moment for the 50th... ;)",,False,,t5_2tf29,False,,,True,t3_160bdz,http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/160bdz/season_5_6_7_and_50th_theory_spoilers/,

Now I have always been of the opinion that a racial change is more likely than a gender change both in-universe and in terms of casting and I'd like to start off the discussion by explaining why.

The Doctor technically *has* changed his ethnicity several times. It's all been Caucasian but it has happened. Even the fact that Eccleston was using a northern accent instead of RP was a pretty forward step in who was playing the Doctor.

Rumors of actors like [Paterson Joseph](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paterson_Joseph) and [Chiwetel Ejiofor](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0252230/) taking the role of the Eleventh Doctor are reported with honest legitimacy and the issue of race is becoming less and less divisive in society.

Unlike gender which is *vastly* divided in a *huge* amount of ways, particularly in media, race is much more homogenized. Basic things like ""can they wear the same clothes?"" and ""can they look good in the same pose?"" change drastically with gender but stay very much the same with ethnicity.

Things like how the character interacts with other characters, including those who were unaware of his regeneration, would require a great deal of reformatting and explanation for gender but require little to no accommodation. Issues like what gender the companions need to be in accordance with the Doctor need absolutely no change at all.

Where ethnicity is really just a change in appearance and would be (for the better part, but obviously with exceptions) treated as such.

**However** I admit that such a change can easily look like a gimmick, not so much as a gender change perhaps but a gimmick nonetheless.

Then in the final moments he regenerates, and gives the audience a very brief look into the new Doctor. Enough to make people excited to see him, but not giving him enough time to establish a full personality yet. This way, the current Doctor gets his final moments, and the new Doctor can actually have a bit of extra time to have his real personality fleshed out before his first series begins. 

Besides, wouldn't it not be as interesting to see the new Doctor in action, then have to wait months before seeing their first dedicated episode? By that point, to me at least, It'd be kinda like, okay he's cool but I know how he is, so why tune in for the premiere to find out the mystery?

It's a little bit of a leap, but hear me out...

During the ending of The Big Bang, when Amy re-creates the universe, Amy remembers the Doctor back into existence.

We all remember this scene if we saw it--Amy sees River, she notices the TARDIS journal, and she remembers the Doctor--*HER* Raggedy Doctor.

She doesn't just call him back into being, she calls him home.

She doesn't ask him to come, she scolds him for being late to her wedding. And her specific invocation for bringing back the Doctor and the TARDIS, the words that finish bringing them back into being?

Something old. Something new.
Something borrowed. Something blue.

Now, Amy initially speaks these words while trying to describe the TARDIS--but how well does this describe The Doctor himself? He is old, but re-created to be something new. He might be a person, but time with him is only borrowed, not forever. And what is the Eleventh Doctor eternally? Blue. Sad. Especially over his loss of the Ponds at the end of the Angels Take Manhattan.

Wait, that last part ended up being tangential, but I like it so I'm leaving it in.

Anyways, when he shows up he's just the way that Amy would want him at the wedding: dressed up and ready to go. And when she brings the Doctor back, Rory remembers... everything. He's not only Rory, he's Rory and the Lone Centurion. He's better than just plain old Rory.

Anyways, when this happens, Amy imprints the need to return into the Doctor. He isn't just the Doctor--he's Amy's Doctor. He can't quit the Ponds until they won't let him back anymore, and even the departure is difficult.
What isn't said, though (because it isn't realized within the confines of the series), is that it is not only because of the potential paradox of running into the Ponds after knowing that the end of that adventure is ""The Final Farewell"" but also since Amy actually wishes him away forever--she lets go of him, she rejects any further experience with him. And The Doctor falls into a depression because he has lost his newest and literalest raison d'être (literally ""reason to be"" or ""reason of being"").

**TL;DR**: At the end of The Pandorica Opens/The Big Bang, Amy not only brought the Doctor back into being, she merged him with her ideals of him (as she did with merging Rory with his Auton counterpart), making him her Doctor. She is his reason to live, and it is only her complete rejection of further interactions with him at the end of The Angels Take Manhattan (well, moreso than the paradox thing) that keeps him away, crushing him.

He literally has no reason to continue to be after the woman who re-created him to be her loyal companion rejected him. He is no longer her Doctor.

has been. This has been in evidence since the very beginning.
His only real drive throughout the entire series is to 
impress people. He's very seldom concerned with actually
helping people, but (much like Sherlock Holmes) he helps people
so that the people will be impressed. It's classic narcissism.


That's why he can't ever connect with his companions. When Rose 
was trapped in the other dimension, before the window closed,
The Doctor seemed very sincere. He made Rose really believe
he loved her, but he purposely dragged out his, ""Rose Tyler, 
I love you."" So that he didn't have to say it.
He also claims that travel between universes will be impossible,
but Rose figures out a way to cross universes only a few years 
later. A 900 year old genius alien time-traveller couldn't figure
out a piece of technology that a 19 year old who worked in a shop
figured out in 1 year? No, the Doctor just lied. He knew that 
travel between universes was possible, but he got bored with Rose
Tyler. He got bored because sociopaths can't stay interested in
one thing for very long. 

Even in the classic series, after the Fourth Doctor spent the last few years with Sarah Jane Smith, when it's time to leave her
behind, he's cold and dismissing. Because he doesn't feel
emotions. The only person he seems to have a real connection with
is the Master, just before he refuses to regenerate. The parallel between Sherlock Holmes and Moriarty to The Doctor and The Master are obvious. 


Most importantly, this suggests that his apparent personality 
changes during each regeneration are a concious decision.
He's not really becoming a new person. He just gets bored letting
other people believe this is his personality. Each ""personality""
is due to the Doctor wanting to appear that way. 


In a way, 
the Doctor is the bad guy in these stories. He insanely lets these
naiive, helpless young girls accompany him on insanely dangerous
trips around the universe. Just so that he can appear to be the 
smartest one in the room. He can't feel love, and the only human
emotion he can feel is an infatuation with other sociopaths like
himself. (i.e. The Master)


He also travels for a long time exclusively with K-9, a robotic
dog. It doesn't seem to strike odd that he would treat a collection
of metal cogs and wires with the same affection that he would give
a living breathing human, because to The Doctor, that's all people
are. Wiring and cogs, just a thing to be manipulated and used.",,False,,t5_2tf29,False,,,True,t3_xez2i,http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/xez2i/is_the_doctor_a_manipulative_sociopath/,

The concept of what might live *inside* the TARDIS has always fascinated me. The Doctor travels around in this big blue box, and we only ever get to see the control room. What lies within it, though? What are the secrets lurking within? What sort of trinket has the Doctor stored in there throughout the years?

Just a headstart: I'm about to get carried away.

**The Doctor Who story I always wanted to tell.**

I never wrote or read any sort of fan fiction. That does not mean I've never daydreamed of writing a Doctor Who story myself. Actually, it's just the opposite - I do that all the time. One of these stories I thought of was called *The Impossible Mug*. It would be about what happened to the Reapers, and why they had never appeared until Father's Day, and why they have never appeared since.

On my musings I always assume the Reapers were created during the Time War, perhaps by the Time Lords themselves, as a weapon to use against the Daleks. Whenever the Time War comes to my mind, I imagine it as the timey-wimey-est thing of all. The Daleks might have at some point become immense paradoxes for some reason or other, and what the Time Lords did was set the Reapers loose on them, while developing some sort of protection for themselves. Maybe what the Doctor did to end the war was simply find a way to allow the Reapers to erase everyone, Dalek and Time War alike, from the face of history. Anyway, this is not the point. I digress.

What *The Impossible Mug* would be about is what happened to the Reapers. Why did they never show up again? Well, the story I'd like to write is about the Doctor *trapping the Reapers inside the TARDIS*. This is how it would go.

This would most likely be the Tenth Doctor, an undefined period after hearing his death was approaching, but before he became Time Lord Victorious in *Waters of Mars*. He'd be looking for ways do to the unthinkable, to break the rules of the Time Lords and change his future, even though it had already become a fixed point in time.

In 19XX England, the Doctor goes to a house, any abandoned dusty old house, and picks up a mug that was left there by the old inhabitants. An empty, white, featureless coffee mug. He puts it inside the TARDIS, and then he travels back half an hour into the past. He lands in the exact same house, the exact same spot, and the mug is still there, waiting to be picked up by him again half an hour later.

Except the Doctor doesn't leave it there. He throws it to the ground and it breaks into hundreds of tiny white pieces, and then he goes back inside the TARDIS... Where the mug is waiting for him, sitting on top of the console. Unbroken, white, featureless, even though it had just broken to hundres of pieces half an hour ago. A perfect, if small, paradox. 

Reapers feed on ruptured fixed points in time. When Rose saves her father from dying when he *should* have died, this calls forth the Reapers from wherever they live into the real world. The mug is not that strong a paradox; it was never a fixed point in time to begin with. So it doesn't attract any Reapers.

But the Doctor knows where to find them. They live in the Time Vortex, and the Doctor has the tools to get them there. He closes the TARDIS doors and dematerialises, only to reappear in the middle of the Vortex. There, he catches the impossible mug and waves it around in the air, shouting for the Reapers to come and grab a bite.

And come they do. With all Time Lords dead, actually meddling in time has become rare. Paradoxes are scarce - the Doctor does something to feed them every once in a while, but still, not enough, not for a race that was created during a time where paradoxes were an everyday ocurrance. So they come, lured by the delicious, sweet and, most of all, *impossible* mug that the Doctor holds in his hand.

As the Reapers approach the TARDIS through the time vortex, the Doctor begins to do what he does best. He runs. As the Reapers enter his ship and being to chase him, he runs deep inside the ship, passing hallways and doors and libraries and swimming pools and wardrobes and Zero Rooms, until he gets where he wanted to: a big, big, empty room. He puts the mug in the ground and gently kicks it forward. He steps aside, watching as all of the Reapers enter the empty room and quickly devour the mug.

But not quick enough. The Doctor closes the door on them, and they can't get through. They can't materialise through the door, because the TARDIS is old, and old walls are impassable barriers for the Reapers. And then, the Doctor gets back to the control room, where he burns up every hallway that lead to the Hall of the Reapers, where they are now trapped forever.

The Doctor believes he was won. There are no Time Lords to enforce the old rules anymore; there are no Reapers to feed on the paradoxes anymore. He can do it, he can stop the prophecy and live on, ""four knocks"" nonwithstanding. The first step towards becoming Time Lord Victorious and towards  discovering how terribly, terribly wrong he was.

**And what has all of this made-up crap got to do with this week's ""Next Time""?**

Well, after ""Hide"" we see a clip of next week's episode. For a brief second, while Clara is saying ""If we're gonna die here, you're gonna tell me what they are!"", we see through the eyes of some creature who growls, and who sees things in a weird, distorted fashion. Much like the Reaper's in *Father's Day* did. And they live inside the TARDIS! Seeing this got my heart pumped, even more than it was already pumped after such a fabulous episode. 

So, after writing this much I'm not even sure what I'm expecting anymore. Half of me is just hoping some people will like my story. The other half wants to see if anyone else thinks it might be the Reapers that live inside the TARDIS, or if it's just me seeing things because this is something I'd previously thought of.

Recently I've been seeing a different sonic screwdriver for sale at the ABC Shop (that's our BBC, but with an A), and it was split into four differently designed parts. (Sorry I don't have a picture but I'm abroad at the moment. I promise this happened.)

There was a little blurb on the back that explained that this is a sonic screwdriver that the Doctor got when the TARDIS was split in time in some way, so when the TARDIS made him a new one because his was destroyed, it became a fusion of four different time zones: Victorian London, Modern Day, the far future, and another one that predates Victorian London that I can't remember. I also recall that it noted that the Doctor was very excited that it had a wood setting.

When I saw this I was very confused, because I have a fairly encyclopedic memory when it comes to Doctor Who and I don't remember a concept like this happening before. However, it did get me thinking - maybe this has something to do with Jenna Louise's different roles? Like the Clara character exists in four different times (we've seen her in the far future as Oswin, we'll see her in Victorian-ish London in *The Snowmen*, and the promotional shots of her costume looked modern) and the Doctor is somehow exposed to every single one because the TARDIS is on the fritz?

1. Eleven has cheated death so many times that his actual death and regeneration will have to be something unusual and interesting (i.e. not just getting dosed with radiation or shot)

2. Steven Moffat loves twisty, ""timey-wimey"" storylines in which present and future characters interact (""The Girl in the Fireplace"", ""Blink"", ""Time Crash"", ""Silence in the Library"" / ""Forest of the Dead"", ""The Big Bang"", ""The Impossible Astronaut"", ""The Wedding of River Song"", ""The Snowmen"", ""The Name of the Doctor"")

My hypothesis, not really supported by any kind of evidence other than the above, is that in a first for the series we will actually see the Twelfth Doctor prior to Eleven's regeneration into him. In other words, it would be like if ""The Three Doctors"" was from Two's perspective instead of Three's.

Perhaps in the Christmas special, in a continuation of whatever happens in the 50th anniversary special, Eleven meets Twelve and they go on an adventure. Twelve ends up inadvertently (or maybe even intentionally?) killing Eleven and causing him to regenerate, thus causing his own existence. Wibbly-wobbly, timey-wimey.

So this is a something i've noticed and i think it's brilliant.

The Angels can't move when they are being observed, this is established canon. So why don't the angels move when they are trying to wreck the Tardis in ""Blink""? My theory is that they can't move because we, the audience, are looking at them. In that scene the lights are switching on and off and every time we can see them they can't move. 

Expanding that theory, even the moving Angel in ""Time of the Angels"" (i hope that's the name of the episode) can be explained. The human eye is considered to be able to see about 150 frames per second, common media is filmed in 24-30 FPS so there is plenty of frames we can't see. They are moving between the frames and our human eye perceives it as a fluid motion. yeaahh grasping straws i know...

So that's my theory what do you think. I hope this hasn't been discussed here...

BTW: While I'm at it, the Statue of Liberty Angel makes sound while moving because every time a new-yorker looks at it, it materialises. We don't know how weeping Angels move so considering they hover, a Statue of Liberty crashing down on the street is probably making a loud noise. But the Statue of Liberty can't move when observed so why is it walking/hovering so consistently, you might ask? Well, what do people do when they see something unusual? Correct!

The infertility isn't sexist because it's Amy herself who thought she was worth less because she was infertile.

In fact she has more emotional problems and turmoil than most companions. So it's not unlikely that she'd have this issue.

And because Amy is a human being with flaws (like any human) that's why she isn't supposed to be a role model sending out bad/good messages to people. If anything, their infertility at least addressed an issue that happens in real life.

Now, with all the emotional/relationship problems Amy and Rory have, you think Moffat could pick any one of them? Well we already did the cheating with Amy, and general breakup from lifestyle differences just isn't dramatic enough. Infertility is dramatic. (That's also why the bridal-style carry of Amy by the Doctor isn't sexist- it's just for drama).

The happiest ending for the Doctor would be the return of his loved ones; Susan, Susan's mother or father (the Doctors daughter or son), and Susan's grandmother (the Doctors wife). It may just be enough to melt that sliver of ice in his heart.

Earlier today he announced, ‘As part of the BBC's blockbuster celebrations to mark the Doctor turning 50, fans will be able to see the Time Lord and his adventures like never before - in 3D!’ 

&gt; To be broadcast using some of the BBC’s HD capacity, Steven Moffat, lead writer and executive producer, said:  ‘It's about time. Technology has finally caught up with Doctor Who and your television is now bigger on the inside. A whole new dimension of adventure for the Doctor to explore.’

This statement has been and continues to be the best way I can describe what it's like watching Doctor Who to people who haven't watched the show. The attachment and emotions you feel towards the characters are unlike anything else on television which in turn only makes it that much more painful when companions and doctors are taken from us. While I think each Doctor has a number of defining moments in their time I would like to look at and talk about special moments we experience with each companion.

When looking back at the companions and the Doctors I see myself as the overprotective helicopter parent^[1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter_parent) meeting my child (the doctor)'s date (the companion) for the first time. I initially think that this person isn't nearly good enough for my doctor and then wonder why my doctor couldn't have stayed with their last significant other (the last companion) because I'd grown to like them so much, but over time you begin to warm up to the new significant other and (since this is television and not the sad sad real world) there is eventually a single moment in which the new significant other becomes the significant other and we as the crazy parents accept them for our dear sweet child. I've found this metaphor sums up my feelings toward the doctor and his companions and hope it at least somewhat translates for others.

Metaphors aside, I think every viewer has a single moment when a new companion ""clicks"" for them. By ""clicks"" I don't mean you fall in love with the companion and think they're the greatest thing to happen to the universe since before the dark times, but rather I mean the moment when you decide that this new companion isn't a perfect person, but they're perfect for the doctor at this stage in his life and I as a viewer finally see that and accept it.

Now on to the companions....
(I've only seen the post 2005 series so that's all I can really offer)

**Rose**

*The End of the World*

""The end of the Earth. It's gone. We were too busy saving ourselves. No one saw it go. All those years, all that history, and no one was even looking. It's just""

Up until now we've had crazy space dude and silly earth girl on their wacky adventures, but this single line changed everything. The gravity of what Rose has been through has finally sunk in and now Rose is established as our proxy to the doctor and his surreal world. With this being the ""first"" episode a human context was necessary so that we as the audience can understand the magnitude of these adventures  and it wasn't until the music cued with the great shot of Rose and Nine that it really started to sink in for me what this show was about and what it was going to become and I think Rose's line here epitomizes the show perfectly.


**Martha**

*Last of the Time Lords*

""I traveled across the world. From the ruins of New York, to the fusion mills of China, right across the radiation pits of Europe. And everywhere I went I saw people just like you, living as slaves! But if Martha Jones became a legend then that's wrong, because my name isn't important. There's someone else. The man who sent me out there, the man who told me to walk the Earth. And his name is The Doctor. He has saved your lives so many times and you never even knew he was there. He never stops. He never stays. He never asks to be thanked. But I've seen him, I know him... I love him... And I know what he can do.""

Oh Martha, the lovesick puppy. For most of her time she just seemed like rebound action getting in between the Ten/Rose love fest, but after Rose isn't that what he needed? Martha gave us a whole season focused on Ten rather than a season focused on Ten's relationship with X companion. That's why I thought Martha's moment is when she is on her trek being the hero and makes the reveal that it's not actually about her, it's about the doctor and it always has been.


**Donna**

*Planet of the Ood*

""You idiot! They’re born with their brain in their hands, don’t you see? That makes them peaceful! They’ve got to be because a creature like that would have to trust anyone it meets.""

This is the one that made me write this post, I read [Munkzxilla's comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/177zlz/the_best_moments_of_donna_noble/c8345q0) and remembered how strongly that single statement hit me. Donna's obnoxious brash personality drove me nuts, but I think this moment cut through all of that and struck a chord with both the doctor and the viewer. Donna was an outside perspective we both needed to hear (even if she had to shout), the doctor because he was so used to getting his way and was losing sight of himself and we the viewers because we'd grown so attached to Ten that we were overlooking his faults. (Just imagine how Waters of Mars would have gone if Donna were there to keep him in line)


**Amy**

*The Best Below*

""What if you were really old, and really kind and lonely, your whole race dead. What couldn't you do then? If you were that old, and that kind, and the very last of your kind, you couldn't just stand there and watch children cry. ""

Well, I fell in love with Amy the second she stepped on screen, she's beautiful. But, what makes her so important in relation to Eleven? Why her? I thought her first reference to children crying set this moment up perfectly to establish Amy as the Doctor's moral compass to guide him through his own hubris. Eleven showed up loud and sure of himself, but  when he was faced with the difficult decision of taking a life he needed someone to make him think and see beyond the straightforward solutions. Amy won me over from the start, but I wasn't ready to accept her for my doctor until this moment when she shows what he would be without her.

1357339544.0,56,self.gallifrey,15z4ft,Rory and The God Complex,73,17,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/15z4ft/rory_and_the_god_complex/,"What I find most curious about this episode was how it went for Rory. There is a moment where he looks up to see a fire exit, thinking it was an escape. After a double-take, it is now replaced with a room door. I don't know what this is exactly, but I suspect this was just the prison's way of trying to lure Rory into his own room. Fortunately, Rory's drawn away by the Doctor before he can investigate. The next strange thing happens when Rory skulks up beside Amy and scares her, saying in monotone: ""Every time the Doctor gets pally with someone, I have this overwhelming urge to notify their next of kin"". He then acts a bit shocked when he notices Amy, as if he was momentarily lost in thought and not actually speaking to her, saying: ""Sorry. The last time I said something like that, you hit me with your shoe. And you literally had to sit down and unlace it first."" Rory makes another remark after getting knocked down by the Minotaur ""Somebody hit me. Was it Amy?"" This can either be said for comical reasons, or Rory keeps thinking about Amy hitting him.

When the Doctor asks Rory if he's found his room yet, and that he might not be scared of anything, he says: ""Well, after all that time I spent with you in the TARDIS, what was left to be scared of?"" Rory answers in the past tense, which the Doctor picks up on, but Rory denies it. I think that in reflecting on the danger which the Doctor has now put the three of them in, Rory believes that they will probably die in this hotel. I find this more believable, considering that this episode makes the point that in traveling with the Doctor, the only end for the Ponds is death or to walk away from it all. I'm not sure if the fire exit that Rory saw was his own room or something else, if he was telling the Doctor the truth about not finding his room, or if he even had enough time off screen to see his room anyway. I would be very afraid in this situation, thinking about what my worst fear is (though you can never be sure until you see it, as the episode points out in the beginning), and I believe that this is exactly what Rory has been doing, since he most likely hasn't seen his room. After protecting someone he loves for over two thousand years, I think the worst thing in his mind involves that person turning on him, beating him, or choosing the Doctor over him. Someone he has occasionally been resentful towards for putting Amy and himself in so much danger, especially after the previous episode when Amy is separated from them and ages 36 years. After all, Rory is only a companion by accessory, and would be with Amy at home or in the TARDIS. Rory seems to be as aware as the Doctor is at this point about how they will eventually get killed if they continue to travel with him, and I think this fire exit he perceived is not just an escape from the hotel, but from the Doctor.

Here goes.

Okay so I know that the question of the Doctor's age is kind of a gray area, but for the moment lets assume what the Doctor has said about his age is true. 

So, when the Fourth Doctor is said to be 759, Romana noted that he had been traveling in the TARDIS for 523 years. This puts the Doctor at 236 when he first stole the TARDIS and began his adventures. This is further supported when the TARDIS matrix is transferred into a human in ""The Doctor's Wife"" and she says that she had traveled with the Doctor for 700 years. This was in the Tenth's time when it has been stated numerous times that he was around 900. 

Just before Ten regenerated, he told Wilfred that he was 906. At Lake Silencio in Utah, the younger Doctor said he was 909 which would keep with the show's years. And finally, this past week he has said he was 1200. Rather big jump, right? If we use the above stated numbers, we can see that the Doctor has spent over 30% of his TARDIS days as Eleven. Why that much time? It is not common for the Doctor to spend this much time as a particular regeneration or without gaining any new companions. 

I feel like this could be connected with the Ponds' leaving and the Doctor's growing darkness. I saw a very good theory on here that whatever happens to the Ponds has already happened for the Doctor and we're seeing the episodes out of order. Just something I noticed/bugged me.

**TLDR:** Doctor has spent a weirdly large amount of time as Eleven, might be connected with Ponds' leaving.",,False,,t5_2tf29,False,,,True,t3_10a4q3,http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/10a4q3/disproportional_amount_of_time_the_doctor_has/,
1368996167.0,63,self.gallifrey,1enfrf,[Theory]The Doctor has a secret that he will take to the grave... vs The Prophecy of The Silence! (X-Post),76,13,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/1enfrf/theorythe_doctor_has_a_secret_that_he_will_take/,"""Doctor has a secret that he will take to the grave... it is discovered. **He wasn't talking about my secret**. He was talking about my grave.""

On the other hand...

The Silence tried to kill the Doctor to prevent the fruition of a specific prophecy, which stated: ""On the fields of Trenzalore, at **the fall** of the eleventh, **when no living creature can speak falsely or fail to answer**, a Question will be asked, a question that must never, ever be answered.""

+ But the Doctor fails to answer when G.I. asks him the question!

+ EVERY living creature failed to answer. With Clara's memory back there were 2 people who knew the Doctor's name. Yet it was River who answered, and River is dead.

+ It was ""a fall"". not ""THE fall"". The Doctor fell a million times before!

What I am getting at is that the prophecy is not yet fulfilled, and maybe, just maybe, it refers to a completely different event. The Silence ARE trying to stop the Doctor, but not this event. It'll be something in the future.

Other proofs:

~17mins: the Doctor says the graves in Trenzalore are from his final battle.

~22mins: Doctor lives in darker and darker hues day upon day. And he will have other names before the end. The Storm, The Beast, The Valeyard

**EDIT 1/Further Proof:**

http://i.imgur.com/YwThqu2.jpg

I am betting there will be a war, and it will be soon. The Doctor needs not die (he escapes certain death before many-a-times ala Tessalecta) but I sincerely doubt that this was the prophecy of the Silence. We were promised a showdown in the Fields of Trenzalore, and there will be one. The graves prove it.

+ Silence will fall when the question is asked... Silence MUST fall

Was there any Silence or even ""silence""? You could argue that the stars were going out would qualify, but the stars also went out during Big Bang Two and the exploding TARDIS was caused by, as far as we know, by the Silence.

Of course that could have easily been explained by a single line ""G.I. was behind it"", but it wasn't. And I don't think the Silents would not show up for a battle, a battle their cult was formed to prevent. After all, they created River Song to fight on their side in an ""endless, bitter war"" (according to Madam Korvian)

It's still a theory though. But it will be very Moffat-y for two similar events both of which coincide with a single prophecy.

**EDIT 2/Further Speculation:**

Now that we know the nature of The Name of The Doctor, we can also perhaps extrapolate that when in the Fields of Trenzalore, when he will be asked *Doctor Who?* He will have to make a decision on who the Doctor is. The morally ambiguous John Hurt Doctor or the Matt Smith Doctor? 

The answer to Doctor Who? is a choice between the nature/Name of The Doctor, not the Doctor's name that would open a lock!

Perhaps by choosing the wrong nature of The Doctor... he had caused the horrors that Madam Korvian is afraid off. The endless war she referred to, leading to the creation of the Silence. Maybe that is the event that the Silence are trying to prevent. Maybe the Silence are not here to protect the past from G.I, but protect the future from... The Doctor.

Proof:

Wedding of River Song, ~10 mins, Dorian: ""You are a man with a long and dangerous past, but your future is infinitely more terrifying. The Silence believe it must be averted.""

~12mins, The Doctor: ""All the times I have heard the question I didn't realize it was my silence... my Death...

&gt; **DOCTOR:** It's an unreasoning dread of robots. You see, most living creatures use non-verbal signals. Body movement, eye contact, facial expression, that sort of thing. 

&gt; **LEELA:** Body language. 

&gt; **DOCTOR:** Exactly. While these robots are humanoid, presumably for aesthetic reasons, they give no signals. It's rather like being surrounded by walking, talking, dead men. 

&gt; **LEELA:** That's what Poul said. 

&gt; **DOCTOR:** Yes. It undermines a certain type of personality, causes identity crisis, paranoia, sometimes even personality disintegration. 

This conversation comes from *The Robots of Death*. It speaks of [**Grimwade's Syndrome**](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Grimwade's_Syndrome) or robophobia, and is a clear mirror to the real-world effect of [**the Uncanny Valley**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_Valley). 

Now compare that to this exchange from *The Waters of Mars*:

&gt; **DOCTOR:**
I hate robots. Did I say?

&gt; **ROMAN:**
Yeah, and he's not too fond of you. What's wrong with robots?

&gt; **DOCTOR:**
It's not the robots, it's the people. Dressing them up and giving them silly voices, like you're reducing them.

&gt; **ROMAN:**
Yeah. Friend of mine, she made her domestic robot look like a dog.

&gt; **DOCTOR:**
Ah, well, dogs, that's different.

Here the Doctor says that he hates robots and attributes this hate to how humans will give them more amiable features. Even though he rationalizes this with claiming that these superficiality are ""reducing them"" he makes an irrational exception for when the robot looks like a dog (almost certainly due to his companionship to K-9).

The Doctor has plenty of cause to hate androids. He's grappled with some artificial human countless times, almost always once a season minimum. But has it actually gotten to the point where the Doctor has a bias?

Interestingly enough the Tenth Doctor was called on to check his prejudices not too earlier in his tenure by Jack Harkness in the episode *Utopia* and there's a decent amount of parallel to be drawn here:

&gt; **DOCTOR:** You are. I can't help it. I'm a Time Lord. It's instinct. It's in my guts. You're a fixed point in time and space. You're a fact. That's never meant to happen. Even the Tardis reacted against you, tried to shake you off. Flew all the way to the end of the universe just to get rid of you. 

&gt; **JACK:** So what you're saying is that you're prejudiced? 

&gt; **DOCTOR:** I never thought of it like that. 

&gt; **JACK:** Shame on you. 

&gt; **DOCTOR:** Yeah.

That last ""Yeah"" seemed like the Doctor was pensive and genuinely understanding the opposing moral side to his actions.

1356545111.0,57,self.gallifrey,15h5sd,My thoughts/speculation on Clara and her role as companion.,62,5,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/15h5sd/my_thoughtsspeculation_on_clara_and_her_role_as/,"This isn't so much theories as to Clara's time-scattered existence (though a bit of that), but rather her as a character and how I predict her role will be.

First off, though, briefly about her predicament. I was a bit disappointed when it sounded as if she was the same character, but the twist was great. Credit to another redditor for pointing this out: this is very similar to how Scaroth was misplaced in time in *City of Death*. There was Future Clara in ""Asylum"", Past Clara in ""The Snowmen"", and it looks like he's going to find Present Clara. Sure, there could be other stuff tying into the 50th anniversary with the Time Lords or the Great Intelligence, but I wouldn't mind if it was as simple as finding out what caused her to split. Also, since they seem to have a few things in common (though not completely shared memories)...what if Present Clara is a baker, specializing in souffles?

So yes, it's disappointing that we didn't quite get a companion from the past, but I can understand why the producers have gravitated to present-day companions. They are, after all, supposed to be an audience identification figure. A companion from the present could make connections to today's world, and would me much more competent with computers and such. Also, stories set in events from the 1900s would properly be historicals. (For example, see *The War Games*: Jamie doesn't know about the Civil War--which is comical--but Zoe, who is from the future, is aware of the many events and devises out how to fix the problems.) Potentially, the companion could be more competent and equal if she was from the modern day, but still have time to grow as she learns the wonders of the universe. I know several of us complain of lack of diversity, but I think it's all done for several reasons--and that is all the more true if you look through the show's history. (Although it's another topic, I don't think it would work with a male companion if there was no one else.)

Another note: watching the trailer, some of those corridors look really similar to those in ""Asylum"". I wonder what that means. (Unless they're reusing sets again.) Also...doesn't Clara seem to have a lot of different costumes, most of which seem to be more complex than casual dress?

Okay, so back to Past Clara for a second. I don't think this relationship was completely romantic, which everyone seems to jump to. (Now, I do happen to be one of those people who doesn't like to categorize relationships, because in reality they're much deeper.) Throughout the first half or so of ""The Snowmen"", she's drawn to him through curiosity, as she says herself. She meets this mysterious man the minute she meets a mysterious snowman, and he seems to know about it. And she's not going to let him get away with brushing her away, because then he would have had the upper hand (I get a sense of competitiveness in Clara). So she's determined to find out, and those scenes where she finds the ladder, hides around the TARDIS, and talks to Vastra are great--here's a companion that's going to take matters into her own hands. And she really does a great job of forwarding the investigating while the Doctor ""sulks"".

Brief note about the ""pond"": I don't think it was meant to do with her seeping memories from ""Asylum"". I think it was just the most practical word. If he refused to help, then when things started going bad he would have some idea of a location to look for.

The relationship takes a turn in the house, and from my perspective, there had not been a suggestion of romance until then. And it's the Doctor who claims he is her ""gentlemen friend"", which is really him just trying to fit in to the time period and underestimating things. Next is the kiss, which she initiates, and then calls him out for blushing. To me, it's almost as if she is just reciprocating because she's getting to know him and he seems interested in her. I didn't see her at all seem to be going after him, but rather they were having some Victorian Christmas fun--and Smith and Coleman have *great* back-and-forth rapport. Overall, I think her main drive is that she doesn't want him to have the upper hand or withhold information from her (see the scene where she climbs up the ladder and follows him in the TARDIS). She wanted to be treated equally--which is not something that happened to women every day in Victorian London. In addition, she doesn't have the most balanced life and wouldn't mind getting away, and she also seems to sense that something was troubling him.

So now, the Present Clara who, based on the trailer, it looks like we'll be spending time with next year. First of all, I think will be the first time we'll have the Doctor show interest in a someone coming with him *first*, again showing the flip. Right now, the Doctor is heading to find the next version of Clara. This is part out of curiosity, but I think he has a competitiveness to him as well. He's a little frustrated that she has alluded him twice now, and he also has taken a liking to her like any companion and wants her safe--especially since she seems destined for death. This part ties into the theme that has been running since the second half of series 6, where he started to feel that he had only hurt everyone who traveled with him. (This also relates not just the 50th anniversary but the recent death's we've had of several classic companions: Elisabeth Sladen, Nicholas Courtney--whose character was mentioned dying on-screen--Caroline John, and Mary Tamm. RIP.)

At the same time, Clara has expressed the need to escape in both ""Asylum"" and ""Snowmen"", so I doubt this next version will be much different. She won't be unwillingly dragged along, like Teagan. Much of her introduction can be skipped because the Doctor (and us as the audience) has just seen it. In fact, I imagine her slightly confused and demanding of information when he drags her in the TARDIS. But above all, I think she will be a challenging partner-in-crime sort of character. Moffat has said that the Doctor has to work to impress her, so I imagine that they continue to one-up each other playfully while still remaining buddies. It's not too different from Romana in *The Ribos Operation*. These actions could be interpreted as flirty, and they might be, but that doesn't mean there will be a full-blown relationship. Meanwhile, they will continue to partner up in saving the world. It's a bit different from Amy, because with Amy the Doctor was also the father figure. Now, they're just friends.

What do you guys think of my interpretation? I tend to get fed up when things are narrowed down to ""romance"" or ""no romance"" because overall I think it does not matter in defining the character or the relationship, and rather drags down from what should be seen. Anyway, I'm really looking forward to the back-and-forth between Clara and the Doctor. And the Cybermen and cyber-things, fun monsters, more of the new TARDIS, and the Doctor attempting to fly a plane (as seen in trailer).",,False,,t5_2tf29,False,,,True,t3_15h5sd,http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/15h5sd/my_thoughtsspeculation_on_clara_and_her_role_as/,

I liked it, but not as much as Asylum. It was ridiculously silly, and I chuckled at many parts, so that's good. Though when they started riding the triceratops I couldn't help feeling it went a little too far on the silly. I'm a fan who prefers their episodes of the more serious persuasion. Nevertheless, it was entertaining.

A couple things that came to mind:

* I'm shocked the TARDIS wasn't the most valuable thing.

* Nefertiti's outfit. I didn't notice it until that above-shot by the camera of her boobs when Filch has his crutch against her neck but now that I notice it, it's a bit odd. Could women wear that in Egyptian times? (thinks of Erimem...)

* It's very clever how the Doctor resolves the situation. The bait and switch with the ships and the Rory/Brian gene chain.

* The opening with the Doctor running around and doing various things seemed a bit...thrown together. I mean, chaos is how episodes start nowadays in the realm of Moffat Who but this one is even more disorganized. Chibnall...

* I laugh at the prop Matt Smith put on Filch's ship. The green ball thing. Lol. That guy really deserved to die. I have no qualms about the Doctor murdering bad people. He does it alll the time.

* I grinned and facepalmed at the two very obvious innuendos.

* I can't believe none of them noticed that they were standing right over a t-rex. Or at least that none of them said ""Wow how did we miss that.""

* Biggest thing that gets my goat: I can't believe they used David Tennant's TARDIS in that photoshop job! How sloppy of them.

* I really liked that camera shot from the pterodactyls POV.

So, pretty nice, very average episode. I like Rory's dad. I was surprised and happy at how resourceful Amy was in this story. Rory too with his nurse gear.

As another example, if the episode was set at some point after The Next Doctor (from Ten's perspective), could we see a Tenth Doctor who is (initially) skeptical of his successor's identity?  Even better, if it was set after Planet of the Dead, would he be outright antagonistic towards 11 as a means of rejecting his predicted death?

Also, with Moffat's penchant for stable time loops (Melody's name, the wibbly lever, etc.), could the Eleventh Doctor introduce something to the Tenth, and would you like to see it?  Personally, I think it would be a bit too cheesy and obvious to have 11 say ""wibbly-wobbly timey-wimey"" and thus inspire 10 to say it during the events of Blink (not to mention raising issues with the 5th Doctor saying it in Time Crash).  Is there a way to do this sort of thing well though?

Then we have an episode (The End of the World and RoA) clearly featuring a star, and an important event surrounding the star, with many aliens featured (not to mention the overall color schemes of these two episodes are very similar). Next we have a lone alien episode (Dalek and Cold War) both of which take place in a more modern setting in an extremely enclosed location with an alien that has a significant interaction with the companion and who was dormant until the Doctor arrived. Then next week we have the upcoming ghost episode, Hide, which I anticipate having several parallels with ""The Unquiet Dead"".

River Song is an echo (pun, unfortunately, intended) of the character she *could* have been. She was built up from the very beginning to be something so incredibly important, something that would *last* and drastically change things for the Doctor.. for a while, at least. And now, it appears as if she is being written off of the show. She has said that she knows all of the Doctor's faces. I took this to mean not all of his previous ones, but all of his future. And what? She had one adventure with 10 and then everything else is with 11? I assumed she would be a major player for a few regenerations, at least. 

This is my ideal River: she never gave away her regenerations to him; he was saved another way. River becomes the Doctor's on again off again companion/wife for a *while*. Years, seasons. I'm not very familiar with Classic Who, so I'm not sure if there is a previous companion I could point to who was like this, but I'm thinking a good version of the Master, or the Rani (I believe? Really sorry if I get this character incorrect). New interpretations of both of them having adventures throughout the series. 11 and River 1. 12 and River 1. 12 and River 2. 13 and River 2. It'd be *interesting*.

Edit: See, the thing I think I may be trying to get at, is that while the character of River should be able to stick around and come back from different points in her timeline, that can't happen. Because Alex Kingston is a human, and she ages, and the way Doctor Who ingeniously avoids that little catch is with regeneration, which they removed as a possibility promptly. It'll be odd when middle-aged River looks drastically older than River at her oldest.

What if the reason Clara is appearing throughout time isn't because the Great Intelligence has put her there (a common theory), but rather because she/the Doctor put here there?

What if there is something the Doctor needs to remember? Clara is his companion, and we know that sometimes, the companion goes great lengths to send messages to the Doctor. What is ""and remember"" is like Badwolf? The same message, appearing throughout time. A warning for the Doctor, either created by the Doctor, or Clara herself.

I'm picturing that there will be some huge battle between the Great Intelligence and the Daleks. If Clara is somehow involved with the GI, the GI would not be happy to find out that the Daleks have converted her to a Dalek. After Asylum, I had posted that I thought the Dalek's tried to turn Oswin because she was the ultimate weapon - the companion of the Doctor, the one he cared about most. Perhaps the Daleks will be after who soon. If the GI is also after her, which seems like an obvious next move after the last episode, there could be a huge conflict between the GI and the Daleks to obtain her. Both would like to use her as a weapon.

I think the Doctor forgets something. Perhaps, to warn him, Clara has sent him a message throughout time. She sent herself throughout time (who knows how), to everywhere he would need to be, with hints throughout. It's definitely a Sparrow-type deal, she sends herself throughout time so all the events occur that lead to him searching for her and her becoming a companion. It's all done so that he remembers. He need to remember to remember not just Clara, but whatever happened that she's trying to warn him about.

Here comes the wild speculation: I wouldn't be surprised if this has to do with the Time War and how it begins. Somehow, the conflict isn't between the Time Lords and the Daleks, but the GI and the Daleks. The GI has made everyone believe it was the Time Lords so that the Doctor would lock up both of the GI's greatest enemies, leaving it free to take over.

In the past, I really enjoyed Steven Moffat's episodes, but now that Doctor Who is gaining notoriety in America, I feel like the show is going a little downhill. I'm sure this is not entirely Moffat's fault, as he has to cater to the needs and wants of all the viewers, but it's making me dislike him as a writer more and more. I feel that he has some brilliant ideas, such as the ark, and a dalek asylum, but in the delivery of those ideas, he's fallen a bit short. While watching Dinosaurs on a Spaceship yesterday, I really couldn't get into the episode since it was so fast paced, and I kept thinking that it was as if they had taken a 2 hour movie, cut bits and pieces out and slapped it into a 43 minute episode. Although RTD did some really terrible episodes himself, I did love that throughout a season, you never knew what was going to happen next, even though he put tiny sneak peeks to the season's end all over the place(ex. Bad Wolf, Rose's face on the screen.) Overall, I really dislike what Doctor Who's fame in America has done to it. (Yes I do live in America, but I grew up watching old Classic Who episodes since I was born in, and my family came from South Africa, and a long line of British ancestors.)

On to Matt Smith.
I honestly don't believe he is a bad actor, but that he's been written to be so different than what the Doctor has always been. Change can be good, yes, but when you take out all the wit and dark humour of him, you're stuck with a random, whimsical guy who sometimes kills people. It just doesn't fit in the Doctor's body(s). He also seems to make shallower connections to people he meets. He'll meet someone new, they'll automatically have a relationship, but the emotion is completely missing.

Alright, my rant's nearing it's end, so please share what you think of the new take on Doctor Who, positive or negative.
Thanks.

EDIT: Sorry, Dinosaurs on a Spaceship was written by Chris Chibnall. Also, thanks for sharing all your different viewpoints.

I liked pretty much all of Sarah Jane's run. I do think Genesis of the Daleks was fantastic, and she was just spectacular in Ark in Space. Her last Classic episode, as well as School Reunion, always make me tear up. 

As far as SJA, I enjoyed it all, but my favorite was probably Death of the Doctor. The stories aren't as complex as Doctor Who stories, but they were, for the most part, very good...despite lots and lots of Slitheen. 

I wanted to post the Babelcolour tribute, but I can't seem to find it. So, instead, here is the end of the Sarah Jane Adventures.

Most of it focuses around him being a *past* incarnation. The reason I've usually seen cited for this is because if Eleven knows who he is, then he must be from Eleven's past. That makes perfect sense, but I don't think it is necessarily the case.

If Ten is in the 50th anniversary then Eleven will remember experiencing the events of that episode as Ten. If Ten meets the John Hurt Doctor then Eleven will remember meeting the John Hurt Doctor when he was Ten. Just like in [Time Crash:](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szuP0oBZX4g)

TEN: Don't worry, I know how this all works out...

FIVE: You remembered being me watching you doing that. You only knew what to do because I saw you do it.

It's been around 300 years since the Doctor was Ten. That's around the same amount of time that passed between Five and Ten. Enough time that he doesn't remember every detail of what happened word for word - like in [Space](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51JtuEa_OPc) and [Time](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkmiefoRcfU) - but he remembers the big important things. 

I'm not saying that I necessarily think that the John Hurt Doctor is ~~a future incarnation~~ *from the future*, but if he is, this is how it would be possible.

Edit: I meant he could be *from the future* rather than a fully fledged incarnation of the Doctor (although that could also be possible).

(SPOILERS)",67,17,61,http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/15prht/some_things_that_bother_me_about_the_angels/,"Two things, actually. They really are just about consistency.

1) Kind of a given, but I haven't seen a single person mention this yet. How the hell does the Statue of Liberty even move, if it's an angel? For one, its super massive, and there's bound to be at least hundreds of people looking at it at any given moment, ever (most of them would be at a far distance, considering it's located on an island off the coast, but still, that counts as looking). Even if there were, somehow, a moment where absolutely nobody was looking at the statue, or had it in their peripheral vision, and the statue moved, Rory and Amy were on top of a building. The Winter Quay, to be specific, and that's not a building located on Ellis Island. The statue would be miles out of place by then, and now that it's located on the mainland, there certainly had to be somebody looking at it. There was, in fact, as neither Rory or Amy were looking at it at some points while they were on the building (unless you count the camera man.. which I don't). Meaning, someone besides them who has no idea about the plot line with the angels and is basically a bystander has found the statue of liberty angel, and would no doubt be constantly staring at it, as it is miles out of place. Other people would soon look at it, and within an hour, the entire city would be in complete confusion as to why an angry version of the Statue of Liberty is located on the Mainland, staring at the roof of the Winter Quay.

This isn't even what bothers me the most; what really gets to me, is the fact that the statue of liberty literally played **NO PART IN THE EPISODE** besides being in the back looking spooky. Normally, Moffat only makes plot elements that don't make sense if they are essential to the plot, like River and the Doctor all of a sudden concluding that a paradox would *spoil the well*. But the statue of liberty was just there, and it did nothing. I would have been much more content with the episode had it just not been there at all.


2) I recall the season 5 episode with the Angels (I forget the episode number or what it's called.. sorry) saying *the image of an angel then becomes an angel.* Then Amy started believing she was becoming stone, etc, etc, because she had looked at the image of an angel, and it came out towards her. Why, then, in TATM, were that first dude and rory not attacked by the image of the statue of liberty that was on the back wall of the elevator they both went up on?

1349040029.0,53,self.gallifrey,10q79n,[Love Week] Part One - The Works of Murray Gold,62,9,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/10q79n/love_week_part_one_the_works_of_murray_gold/,"Due to popular demand for ""more love"" here at /r/gallifrey I propose starting a ""love week"" where the point of interest is discussing and examining those little things in Doctor Who that you love. 

**EDIT**: This is just a suggestion for an overall ""theme"". Others are warmly welcomed to join in if they'd like.

To start the ball rolling I'm going to discuss one of my favorite things in New Who: the works of Murray Gold.

I've always been one to say that score is 50% of any movie or show. Whether a scene is touching or suspenseful or triumphant is deeply determined by what message the score is conveying. The flavor and feel of a show isn't just in performances and cinematography. A great deal of it is formed by the almost subconscious presence of music to set the mood.

And when Doctor  Who rebooted itself it hit the *jackpot* when it came to score, lucking out on the *incredibly* talented Murray Gold who is the best composer I have seen in television since Michael Giacchino.

I could sing his praises all day but for the sake of brevity I'd like to crystallize his tenure into three separate parts: his work during the Ninth Doctor, his work during the Tenth Doctor, and his work during the Eleventh Doctor.

**Ninth Doctor**

The first thing we experience in all of New Who is [**the new opening title sequence.**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRE1aOogdPI) We're leapt straight into it and it is a *massive success* with an opening ""Wawawaawaaaaaaaaa"" that creates the ""leaping in"" excitement of the [**1980's lead in**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4On0uLqH_I) while feeling very modern. The addition of accompanying strings is *magnificent* and the piano at the finish was *brilliant!* Seriously, Doctor Who could not have had a better step forward than the one that Murray Gold gave them.

The next thing we experience is *also* shaped by Murray Gold and it's really these first few minutes that the scale of RTD's Doctor Who is shown. [**Westminister Bridge**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_rkVcat-WA), the second thing we hear, begins with a slow orchestral build. It's mysterious, grand, and maybe a bit sad. Then we launch into this very quick and moving pop-synthy beat. It not only shows off the diversity of Gold as a composer, but it really sets the fantastic/mundane contrast that this season of Doctor Who would play so much off of.

I would be remiss if I didn't mention [**The Doctor's Theme**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRrOI7By5fc). It's so... beautiful. It's wholly original and so different from everything Doctor Who has ever done before but it so perfectly embodied what the post-Time War Doctor was. This theme pretty much defined RTD's Doctors, sad but so mysterious and wonderful.

**Tenth Doctor**

During the Tenth Doctor Murray Gold was given the entire BBC Orchestra and a lot of freedom. He managed to create two great action themes for the Doctor: [**All the Strange, Strange Creatures**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67goV9LyI5o) and the lesser-appreciated (and much more swashbuckle-y) [**The Doctor Forever**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmAZCI_9C60). 

He manages to explore a great range from the very tribal [**Tooth and Claw**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB2FCUnJPwI) to the Elfman-ish [**Donna's Theme**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3OyVsrVGm_c) to the bizarre and spacey [**Cassandra's Waltz**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXyiVpnd6Po) to the old-school throwback meets dubstep of [**The Master's Theme**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcagHjJRl4I) (which worked in the four beat wonderfully and felt madly unhinged, much like this new Master). 

At the same time he creates *another* brilliant title sequence [**for Torchwood**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eqnml1VO7s) and creates some of the most moving work in Doctor Who's history which is, quite frankly, at the level of *film scores* like [**Vale Decem**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAeu7_jRySA).

**Eleventh Doctor**

Doctor Who changes hands and Gold has to set a wholly new feel for the show, which he does and does *amazingly*. He completely reinvents the opening with a [**New Theme**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G8G0P__dwI) that exchanges it's launching-in wail for a brand-new build that helps with a new highly-orchestral style.

But his greatest triumph is no doubt [**I Am the Doctor**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5D-QPDGhCtM) and the many variations therein. An amazingly versatile theme that embodies the Eleventh Doctor just as well as The Doctor's Theme embodied Nine and Ten. It's fun and bouncy and whimsical and just perfectly *Eleven*.

1348692975.0,53,self.gallifrey,10iytd,The Moffat Paradox - Are the Companions the True Protagonists of Doctor Who?,64,11,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/10iytd/the_moffat_paradox_are_the_companions_the_true/,"Not long ago Moffat made the (fairly bold) [statement](http://www.metro.co.uk/tv/896754-steven-moffat-the-doctor-who-companion-is-the-main-character) that the protagonist of Doctor Who were not the Doctor but were, in fact, his companions.

Now while in many of his interviews he'll cite standard formula and there being ""good, dramatic reasons"" why companions must be of [a certain age, gender, and romantic interest](http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/features/steven-moffat-would-a-middleaged-person-abscond-in-a-magic-caravan-8096356.html) along with [having to be attractive](http://www.geekosystem.com/steve-moffat-doctor-who-companions-attractive-girls/) this time he seems to be less following the established order out of necessity but honestly believing that Doctor Who is [""their story"".](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lC5O68JLPg)

But by the same hand Moffat's a *huge* fan at heart. He adores the Doctor and says himself that *Blink* can't possibly be the best episode of Doctor Who because [""It's hardly got the Doctor in it!"" [@ 1:52]](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bWyzeTFGPI&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=112s)

This leads us to a difficult paradox. If the story's protagonist is the companions than the Doctor would naturally become a mentor or partner to compliment or in other ways catalyze their story but being the *enormous* fan that he is Moffat wants the Doctor to be the hero that he knows and loves.

But having both is a precarious edge to tread. Having the Doctor be the ""hero"" but not be the protagonist causes a plethora of storytelling troubles. 

An excellent example of this causing issues is in Series Six where the show tries (and in many ways fails) to juggle the weight of a Doctor-centric death, an Amy-centric abduction and pregnancy, and a River-centric supplot that runs all throughout it. 

Some of Moffat's most successful stories have the Doctor either edge aside and act as a catalyst for the events of a character (A Christmas Carol, Blink) or take center stage and be a very primary participant (The Eleventh Hour, The Girl in the Fireplace). Rarely does trying to have the Doctor *both* take the hero role *and* give primary focus on the companions actually pan out.

But what are your thoughts? Is there really a conflict here? Any opinions on Moffat's stance or style?",,False,,t5_2tf29,False,,,True,t3_10iytd,http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/10iytd/the_moffat_paradox_are_the_companions_the_true/,

Making the 9th Doctor really the 10th, the 10th really the 11th, and Smith's Doctor really the 12th. In one of the novelisations of DW The Master says ""The Valeyard, Doctor, is your penultimate reincarnation... Somewhere between your twelfth and thirteenth regeneration"". This makes Smith either The Valeyard all along, or a ticking time bomb until the events that turn him into it.
The person behind door number 11 in God Complex is not Hurt, but Tennant; because he is the actual 11th doctor, and the last before the Valeyard. This also helps to explain why Tennant's doctor was so angry about his death saying ""but me? I can do so much more"". Tennant's doctor was angry knowing that his next incarnation would become The Valeyard.",DISCUSSION,False,,t5_2tf29,False,h,,True,t3_1j013i,http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/1j013i/the_ultimate_valeyard_theory_xpost_from/,

However, I have become increasingly worried about one aspect of his time as showrunner.

After getting into the rhythm of things with series 5, he went huge for series 6; big arcs, shocking revelations, the whole shebang. And I loved it.  Then, with the first half series seven, it seems like he's setting the show up for something even bigger.

If this trend continues, the show will be forced to get bigger, and bigger, and bigger. More action, more mystery, more everything. Which will be great. For a while. Then, after a few series of one-upping the series before, it'll eventually become just a caricature of the show that we all love. It'll be a procedural action show, about a crime fighting alien. Entertaining, but nothing worthy of another fifty years.

The fear of this potential fate of my favorite television series is also tied to my biggest hope for the anniversary special.  Throughout the remaining episodes of the seventh series, it gets bigger, and bigger, as it's doing. Then it pops. Everything explodes.

Forget the multi-Doctor hopes (though I am happy about Tennant's return), forget returning companions (again, yay Rose!). My hope is that the fiftieth serves as a celebration of the rich history of the show, but more importantly, I hope it serves as the catalyst for a big change.

I, for one, trust Moffat to deliver a game-changer.  Something to keep it interesting, but set it on a path that breaths another fifty years into it.  If Moffat stays, I want to see a change.  If Smith stays, I want to see a change. If the show stays, I *need* to see a change.

We've seen shifts all throughout the show's colorful history. We've seen it start to get sillier, we've seen it start to get darker, and we've seen it start to get more action-oriented.  The show handles change beautiful, and this is the time for a change.

Before 9 realizes the Dalek is currently powerless, we see him run to the door banging on it screaming to be let out.
 
With 10 I think of the episode ""Midnight"" where The Doctor literally lost all control to the unknown entity, something he is not accostemed to.  A being he cannot reason with and can render 10 powerless. He looked scared as sh*t when he was paralyzed 

11 I remember having a similar moment to 9 in the ""Asylum of the Daleks.""  The scene when 11 is right outside Owsin's door and the crazy Daleks are closing in on him he is basically begging Oswin for help and in. A noticeable panic.

I for one fell in love with this series from the off - I loved the characters, I loved the aliens and I just adored the idea of Sarah Jane Smith, one of the best companions, hunting down and stopping aliens with her sonic lipstick and her giant alien computer. I found the second series to be the show's weakest output, with Anjli Mohindra still getting to grips with her acting and some of the poorest episodes of the series' run. But one thing I found with all the other series is that they perfectly maintained one thing - consistency. Bar the second series, I didn't think there was a single episode I would have called bad. Infact, I'd go as far to say that it often put out episodes that were as good as the best of *Doctor Who* - examples being [*Whatever Happened to Sarah Jane?*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c9kVV9xOKg) and [*Death of the Doctor*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KbXAq-Fi8JI) - one of my favourite stories which featured the Eleventh Doctor and classic companion Jo Grant.

But enough of my boring ramblings, I want to know what *you* thought of the show. Did you enjoy it? If so how come? And if you didn't, why not?

Daily Motion has many uploads of old episodes and seems to be the best (non-legal) way of watching the show.

They've done such good work in restoring the footage, it's really evident in the black and white serials, it's just so clean, the sound is also fantastic. They've been great with commentaries, special features such as 'Cheques, Lies and Videotapes' on the Revenge of the Cybemen where it was mainly about how fans had been taping episodes and selling them also leading onto the first VHS being released, not forgetting the documentaries about the origins and why the programme ended. The simple and effective design of each case and how they have remained consistent over the past 13 years.

One of their biggest achievements is the animating of two missing episodes of Patrick Troughtons serial 'The Invasion', which has given hope that all the missing or incomplete serials will be released at some point, which has been indicated by the upcoming release of William Hartnells 'The Reign of Terror' which will have another 2 episodes animated. 

The other achievement has been the colourisation of a few Jon Pertwee episodes, which is being put into a whole serial of his which happens to be 'The Mind of Evil'

They will also be releasing Spearhead From Space on Blu Ray in 2013 as I believe it's the only classic serial to be filmed completely on film.

I only got into Doctor Who with the 2005 series, my first jump into classic who was the DVD's Remembrance Of The Daleks and The Resurrection Of The Daleks. It seemed like a good place to start with the Daleks, ever since then I've been collecting the DVD's. I've been a bit slow recently and I only need about 4 more to be completely up to date. But it's been a fun few years, they've been really good at filling the voids in the months when new Who has been off air. I'm looking forward to finally being able to marathon the entire series. 

The restoration team have done a great job in bringing the classic serials to the modern time.

What's everyone else's thoughts on the DVDs and how they started collected and watching them.

**60. INT. CRUCIBLE VAULTS - NIGHT**

**THE DOCTOR &amp; ROSE still in SPOTLIGHTS; looking up, hearing the sound of MASSIVE HYDRAULICS. DAVROS calmer, now:**

DAVROS

It begins! Finally, we will achieve all that I have ever wanted. Peace. Everlasting peace.

THE DOCTOR

They’ll kill you, Davros. Once it’s done. Cos the Daleks despise you, for being flesh. Ohh, you will be exterminated.

DAVROS

As I said, Doctor. Peace.

Silence, as Davros glides away from them. Hold. Only the noise of huge hydraulics from above. The Doctor looking up, trapped, helpless. But Rose is looking at Davros. She’s quiet, sad:

ROSE

What happened to you? I mean your face. Your eyes. What happened?

DAVROS

Are you showing me pity, Miss Tyler?

ROSE

Someone must have. Once upon a time.

DAVROS

(quiet)

Not for so many years. But I was like you, back then. Walking tall, so young and so proud. On a world called Skaro. A world at war.

ROSE

With who…?

DAVROS

With each other. My race, the Kaleds, in perpetual battle against the Thais. My very first memory; hiding underground, with the screams of battle above. I saw the surface of the planet, only once…

**On CU Davros…**

**61. EXT. SKARO - DAY**

**FX: CU DAVROS, the MAN. Gaunt, strong, in a dirty-white medic’s coat. FX for the BOILING RED SKY behind him…**

**FX: REVERSE. DAVROS a small figure on a VAST PLAIN. DMP of a RUINED WORLD. A shattered domed city; weird, warped cliffs in the distance. NUCLEAR CLOUDS in the sky.**

**CUT TO:**

**62. INT. CRUCIBLE VAULTS - NIGHT**

DAVROS

And I swore, then. To end it. I pledged my life, to help my people, to ensure their survival.

**CUT TO:**

**63. INT. HOSPITAL HARD - DAY**

**These images are now cranked up, wild &amp; jittery, only glimpsed. It’s like a WORLD WAR I WARD. But WINDOWLESS, underground. INJURED SOLDIERS, bandaged, WOMEN in simple nurses’ uniforms, running, panicking.**

**JUMP CUTS of DAVROS the MAN, going from bed to bed. Studying one SOLDIER, opening his eyelid, shining a torch; preparing a syringe; injecting the soldier. The soldier thrashing in agony; Davros &amp; Nurse holding him down.**

DAVROS 00V

I studied the soldiers. Their frailty. Their pain. I sought to find a way, to free them from the agonies of the flesh. And then…

**PRAC FX: EXPLOSION, Davros silhouetted against FIRE -Glimpsed, jagged images - nurses - screaming - running - CU Davros, his head now BALD, red, peeling; holding both hands over his face, so he can’t be seen. He’s screaming.**

**CUT TO:**

**64. INT. CRUCIBLE VAULTS - NIGHT**

DAVROS

…I became victim myself. Perhaps it was necessary. To inspire me.

THE DOCTOR

…except you weren’t helping those soldiers. You were experimenting on them. You even experimented on your own family. Twisting the evolution of the Kaled Race, until they became the Daleks.

DALEK CAAN (giggling) We were born! Out of blood!

DAVROS

(still at Rose)

Can you imagine? I had one idea! An idea that has never stopped. Rolling out across the centuries. I have slept, and woken, and died, and every time I open my eyes, there they are. My Daleks. Outlasting eternity. And all from one man!

THE DOCTOR

Oh, but every time you open your eyes, Davros… There’s me.

**You know what** I'm just going to assume this happened off-screen because it's brilliant and now I like Bleach's Davros much more.

I started with New Who a few years ago, rapidly watched every episode and immediately started craving for more. I then went on to watch almost every episode of the classics, listen to a good deal of the audio plays, and obsessively collect bits of merchandise.  
Looking back, I think what sparked my infatuation with *Doctor Who* was the scene where Eccleston's Doctor gives his spiel that goes something like this:  
""Do you know what we were saying? About the Earth revolving? It's like when you're a kid. The first time they tell you that the world's turning and you just can't quite believe it because everything looks like it's standing still. I can feel it. {he grabs her hand} The turn of the Earth. The ground beneath our feet is spinning at a thousand miles an hour. And the entire planet is hurtling around the sun at sixty-seven thousand miles an hour and I can feel it. We're falling through space, you and me. Clinging to the skin of this tiny little world and if we let go... {he drops her hand}. That's who I am. Now forget me, Rose Tyler.""  
After that, I couldn't forget this new, wonderful, and mysterious man. And just like Rose, I decided to chase him, and ended up going on a journey through the universe that I hope will never end.

How?,60,10,60,http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/1dqcnf/would_you_be_in_favor_of_changing_doctor_whos/,"One of the most common concerns I've seen posted here recently, to which I'm somewhat partial, is that this series' episodes have featured rushed endings or deus ex machinas. The writers are evidently attempting to make each episode bigger and more movie-like, but are still working with the 45-minute run-time. It seems to me that this sensibility is more applicable to a longer format, ala Moffat's other series *Sherlock* (which features 90 minute episodes). 

How well do you think *Doctor Who* would work with longer individual episodes, but fewer episodes per series (converting the total run-time of a current 13-episode series in this manner would give us 6-7 90 minute episodes)? Or would you change the run-time in some other manner? Might the old format of shorter episodes making up longer serials still work? I'm curious to hear /r/gallifrey's thoughts on this. 

Edit: Coming back to this thread just now, I am pleasantly surprised at how many people suggested a run-time of around 60 minutes.

If you feel that I have broken Reddiquette please report me to the mods but please do not abuse the downvoting system, thank you.***

First I'll start off (as usual) with a thanks to those that have been writing about what they love in Doctor Who. It's been really awesome for these often-underappreciated facets get their ten minutes in the limelight. Goodness knows they deserve it. Right, moving on!

Clothes make the Doctor. Don't believe me? Look at [**this**](http://i.imgur.com/U1fSa.jpg) or [**this**](http://i.imgur.com/WwRz9.jpg) or [**this**](http://i.imgur.com/l1kq0.png) or [**this**](http://www.slantmagazine.com/images/house/television/doctorwhoeot2_10.jpg).

Yeah, it's freaky. (In fact the clothes are so iconic that nearly every Doctor is quickly ushered into some ""transitional outfit"" to segue Doctors like [**here**](http://i.imgur.com/QvIp7.png), [**here**](http://i.imgur.com/t6Iun.png),  [**here**](http://i.imgur.com/C9Beq.jpg), and [**here**)](http://doctorwhotv.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/Doctor-Who-The-Eleventh-Hour-2.jpg)

And while the Doctor may not have the wear-the-exact-same-thing-all-the-time wardrobe that many Doctors during JNT's era had, they each have their own distinctive style and look. It is this look that creates that Doctor, that becomes the inextricable image of that character.

Seeing as there's *so much* to tell from that infamous scarf to umbrellas with punctuation for handles I can't imagine that I'll be able to cover the Doctor's *vast* array of styles. For now I'll focus on the wardrobes of New Who (and hopefully elaborating on the others in the comments).

**Ninth Doctor**

A really bold departure from Doctor's past. Not formal, not complicated, not colorful or extravagant. We got a dark and informal getup for a dark and informal Doctor.

Designed by then-costume coordinator [**Lucinda Wright**](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Lucinda_Wright) the Ninth Doctor's style includes (as Jack so flippantly put it) a U-Boat captain's jacket, an array of v-necked jumpers, black trousers and combat boots. 

I really can't say enough how bold it was to make a suit so incredibly different from everything else the Doctor's ever worn. It really sets Nine (and New Who as a whole) apart from the rest of the show.

**Tenth Doctor**

Doctor Who Confidential did [**a marvelous piece**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z32s1tO23SI) on the Tenth Doctor's wardrobe. How Tennant felt getting in it, the choices to make it more stylized and fashionable than Nine's. It's certainly an interesting watch.

Created by [**Louise Page**](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Louise_Page), the costume designer and director for Ten's run. To date she is the longest-running and most prolific designer in Doctor Who's *entire history*, creating the iconic wardrobes for Rose, Martha, Donna, the Master, Rassilon and virtually every single character in between. She does a *marvelous* [**series of interviews**](http://www.youtube.com/user/stevenricks?feature=watch) where she answers everything from why they chose Converse for Ten to how they picked his glasses.

Ten's look was described by many as ""geek chic"" and it's no secret that he's considered by many Who fans as ""the dreamy one"". His look right down to [**his stance**](http://i2.listal.com/image/1703166/500full.jpg) is incredibly iconic.

**Eleventh Doctor**

What can I say? Whether it meant to or not this thing brought back the bow tie. This Doctor's one of the few Doctor's to actually have remarks made and remark himself on his clothes.

In fact the clothing is so intertwined with the character they actually have a run-down of the Doctor's clothes in a a bit of a [**special for Children in Need**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaKPJpSMMjA). 

The style was created by the costume designer for season three of Torchwood (and the current costume designer for both Doctor Who and Sherlock) [**Ray Holman**](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Ray_Holman). Here's [**a sketch he made that eventually became the Eleventh Doctor**](http://clothesonfilm.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Doctor-Who_Matt-Smith_Ray-Holman-sketch.jpg). He describes [**his thoughts on the Eleventh Doctor**](http://clothesonfilm.com/doctor-who-interview-with-costume-designer-ray-holman/9611/) as ""[...] a mixture of professor and student; he is still learning yet is an authority on many, many things"" and based a lot of the design on Matt Smith himself.

It's also worthy to note that Matt has [**a unique stance of his own**](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_s59ARuFLHSs/S7jGswVfdaI/AAAAAAAABA0/JYOl-SVN6Dc/s1600/TheEleventhHour14.jpg) (bowlegged with a hunch leaning forward).

I just think that if Moffat's main takeaway is what I think it is, he might try to make it fit.  Also, I'm dumping way too much text.  I'll do a suitable TL;DR soon.**

I've been mulling this around and don't have time to get it all out right now, so bear with me!

I think Moffat is going to wrap up the entirety of the show (as it stands so far) as a story about love, family, and the importance of doing what's right for those you love most.  With the ongoing themes of remembrance, memories, and loved ones in the last few years, it would bring a lot of things full-circle. Doctor Who had always been a family show...now it's a show about family.  Sounds like fluff, but there are some interesting ""hard"" details that could back this up - just a bit for now since there's a LOT of evidence.

1. **The Doctor's Love:** Progression of the Doctor from non-romantic character who loves in a familial/friendship sense (Susan through all other companions) to one who loves passionately.  The passion love begins with slight interest (Grace) then moves to passion (Rose,) matures to time-traveler ""co-habitation"" (River,) and all the while experiences the ups and downs that come with love (infatuation, bliss, heartbreak, depression, etc.)  Now we have Clara...

2. **Remember Me:** It goes without saying there's been a memory/remembrance theme overload the last couple years.  Note the people who want to be remembered or who are looked back on/discussed at length: Rose, River, Amy, Clara, the Doctor.  Now the Doctor's previous adventures are being called in here and there...including Susan in the latest episode!  There is keen attention paid to the importance of remembering - particularly remembering those you love.  That's a pretty big theme in life.  Nobody wants to be forgotten and alone. Considering that the Doctor is the loneliest being in the universe and the show title explicitly ""forgets"" him or doesn't know him...having family/loved ones to surround you and remember you is especially poignant for him.

3. **A Rose by Any Other Name:** I think Rose/Clara/River are tied together somehow given the recent episodes and the fan theories around them.  Between the Bad Wolf time/space manipulation, River's eternal life on a hard drive, and the past-and-future memory absorption of the Doctor and Clara respectively, there are interesting bits of evidence on this subreddit that suggest they are the same entity.  Also interesting is the wiki note that Susan's name supposedly means ""Rose"" in High Gallifreyan. (Though ""Susan"" itself means lotus and it's not directly in the show, so it's not necessarily evidence.)

4. **Grandfather Time:** I also think that Susan is involved here. The last episode's reference to his granddaughter firmed up any question of Susan's relationship to the Doctor in preparation for the 50th.  I think she is River/the Doctor's granddaughter.  How is this possible?  If in fact the 50th is a ""fan-service"" multi-Doctor story and has something to do with the Time War (stretching,) Gallifrey could be unlocked and River's child sent there.  Beyond the other multi-Doctor specials, it gives more credence to 1's ""I will be back"" speech since he will have again met his future self.  Also, this can give a fun explanation to why the 1st Doctor speaks like a sooth-sayer and a stereotypical wise old guy - he's seen how far he will go, he's seen his own future, and he knows via story what he will go through.  But he's never actually FELT it.  Paraphrasing the Doctor, he ""acted older and smarter than everyone else like you do when you're young.""  If he has an idea of the fate/family to come, he'll be even more sure of himself. 

4. **What's in a Name?** We have an interesting duality with the importance of naming starting to appear.  Your name is your identity, it is how the history books remember you, and sometimes it is all that you own - sometimes, it is worth dying to save.  When asked why he is opting to hang versus admit a crime he did not commit, John Proctor from Arthur Milller's *The Crucible* says, ""Because it is my name! Because I cannot have another in my life! Because I lie and sign myself to lies! Because I am not worth the dust on the feet of them that hang! How may I live without my name? I have given you my soul; leave me my name!"" When your name is heard, how does the hearer feel?  What do they remember?  What does it inspire them to do?  Long after we are dead, our name tells many stories.  For the Doctor, it's even more important - he's a time traveler.  He sees his impact on history and feels it first-hand. But then, who cares about someone's ""real"" name?  Aren't the person behind the name and the deeds they do what matters?  This is where heroic archetypes/titles are more relevant.  This is what the Doctor's been doing.  He's wrapped himself in the myth of ""the Doctor,"" a preposterous-yet-unstoppable hero (or villain) tied to trillions of stories throughout time.  In the span of space and time, he is mostly known as a legend, a myth, a fable.  I believe he's either using it to A. protect something/someone or B. prove something to someone.  Something drives the Doctor away from his given name, which might be very important to this theory.  Given names are, after all, given by family.

5. **Can't Stay in Neverland Forever**  Ever since Matt Smith' head poked out of the TARDIS to find his 7-year-old mother-in-law living alone, children and children's themes have been at the forefront.  As discussed on /r/gallifrey previously (can't remember where,) ""I grew up without parents"" and ""where are my children"" are the standout struggles. Seasons 5, 6, and 7a have plenty of examples with the three Ponds (don't forget the Doctor's cradle!)  Season 7 brings us Clara, and she's a crescendo.  In all three incarnations, she's lost her mother and she loved her very much.  In TRoA, Clara's mother's death is critical to resolving the conflict.  Also in all three cases, her life doesn't allow ""childish"" wiggle room.  First she's in a survival situation against killer robots.  Then she lives two Victorian lives, ever-vigilant to keep them separate. Finally, we see her with her dreams on hold, committed to raising her best friend's children.  Clara's so busy in this last one that she struggles with a basic communication technology that her 26-year-old peers in 2013 use daily.  Her questions sound more like... well, a stereotypical mom's. Not to beat this to death, but Clara also looks after children in all of her incarnations.  It's what drives her. Raising children (that aren't hers? that don't have mothers?) is a primary function of Clara Oswin Oswald.  Seems to me that she's something like a paragon of adulthood/parenthood.  She works tirelessly for the right reasons. She is giving of her time.  She is selfless, willing to die so that others may live.  She is loyal through death and beyond resentment.  She has big dreams and wakes to follow them.  Despite her past tragedies and her current burdens,  she does not allow sadness, self-pity, or righteous martyrdom to rule her life or imprint on others.  She is a motherly ""ideal."" And ""clever boy"" seems like a motherly phrase.  I'm not saying that Clara is the Doctor's mother (yet,) but she's certainly maternal.  I think these themes and characters lend credence to a 50th that deals mainly with the Doctor's family.

And while there's some light commentary on humanity's need to collect, observe, and post to the internet until something amazing becomes something mundane, it's not really sent home and it's not the episode's core message.

The last episode I can pin down that makes truly solid social critique was *The Beast Below* and it's skewering of the follies of a democracy that would rather benefit from cruelty unaware than seek the truth. Since then episodes haven't really focused on making a social statement so much as telling a character-focused story or mythos-heavy episodes that push plot along.

However, I do encourage New Who fans to read the comments if they are looking for more of an insight into the classic series, whether it's just for further knowledge of the Doctor Who universe or recommendations on what classic stories to watch. That being said, let's continue.

Robert Holmes (1926-1986), for those that don't know, was the script editor for Doctor Who from 1975-1977, and wrote stories for the series from 1969 (first story being *The Krotons*) to his tragic death in 1986 (his last story being *The Mysterious Planet*, although he contributed to *The Ultimate Foe* before he died). He is considered by most to be the best script editor for the series, as well as the best writer, penning stories that were commonly believed to be the best among Doctor Who's 50 year run. 

Since I have been on a huge Robert Holmes binge lately (Netflix hasn't been helping...with classics like *Spearhead From Space*, *Pyramids of Mars* (credited as ""Stephen Harris"") *The Ribos Operation*, and *Caves of Androzani*), a few questions have popped up into my mind concerning the writer's work:

*The first (and obvious one): What is his best story?

*What is his weakest story?

*Do you think there's a noticeable evolution in his writing style in his nearly 20 years on the program?

*What aspects of Holmes' scripts made them work so well? (Provided you agree that they work)

*Robert Holmes didn't write a story between 1978's *The Power of Kroll* and 1984's *Caves of Androzani*. Do you think this affected his story telling style at all?

*And lastly (and relevant to New Who fans): Would you use a Robert Holmes story to introduce a New Who fan with no previous experience with the classic series to said television program? Why or why not? If so, which story would it be?

Sorry if it sounds like I'm going a bit overboard here, but I find the man to be sort of a genius and really wanted the see the perspective of different fans on the subject.

I originally wasn't planning on picking this up since it's written by the same people who wrote the underwhelming Assimilation^2 crossover comic, but I'm glad I changed my mind.  It's not the most exciting Doctor Who story ever told, but it nails the characterization of the First Doctor and his companions.  You can tell the writers have took a lot of care to make this fit in with the type of stories they were telling in the First Doctor era.  It features a return appearance of a villain who I hadn't seen before, so I assume the story has a bit more impact if you're more familiar with the First Doctor's stories.

The artwork is also fantastic.  The series will feature connecting covers done by the fantastic Francisco Francavilla, who you might know from the [posters he draws for every episode](http://francesco-francavilla.blogspot.com/search/label/Doctor%20Who), so picking this one up physically instead of digitally or collected in a trade paperback has its benefits.  The interior art is also nice.  It doesn't feature the painted art like Assimilation^2 which I found to be far too static and not dynamic enough.  It's not incredibly detailed, but it gets the characterization of the First Doctor perfectly.

I am trying to avoid the cliché claim that it was darker, as Series 6 was far darker than series 5, and yet it still had the fairytale edge.

In fact, the general vibe I got from the episode and trailer was more outright Gothic horror. The trailer was very focussed on showing of the monsters, and they all look like pretty grotesque creations, even the Cybermen in that one second seemed to move in a very creepy fashion.

Then there was in The Snowmen itself, the Ice Governess, while the effects were not great, the design was like something out of a child's nightmares (yes, I realise why that is) The scene where Simeon is possessed by the Great Intelligence evoked a strong Gothic vibe.

What we know of series 7.2, it's very Victorian era orientated, and even the ones not based there seem to have been pitched with the intention of horror. The Cyberman episode has actually been confirmed with the pitch to make them as terrifying as possible.

I'm just getting the feeling that the rest of this series may have a tone that harkens back the the Hinchcliffe/Holmes years of the show.

More importantly, (and hopefully in my opinion) I'm wondering if this is the start of the Doctor Who that everyone was first expecting when it was announced that the creator of Blink and The Empty Child would be running the show. I'm not saying that I wasn't pleasantly surprised with the fairytale approach, I did enjoy it, but I was hoping for a show less afraid of actually giving people nightmares when Moffat took over.

I'm just wondering if it was just me imagining this and having wishful thinking, or if anyone else got a similar impression.",,False,,t5_2tf29,False,,,True,t3_15i5p2,http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/15i5p2/the_tone_of_the_snowmen_and_the_72_trailer_minor/,

There is so much I want to talk about in this scene between Amy and the Doctor, and I know that there's a perfectly good episode discussion thread up and running, but since I wanted to focus in on this moment in particular, I hope to be pardoned for opening up an independent channel for discussion.

So basically, what do you think of this view? It's very much a movement against the Ninth and Tenth Doctor's take on running. ""RUN!"" is the first thing we hear Nine say, and Ten is all about the running. It's been touched on with Eleven when River tells the Doctor that he can run, in *The Wedding of River Song*, and it's what Oswin tells the Doctor to do. But here we very definitely hear Eleven talking about *why* he runs. So like I said, it's a very definite and conscious movement in the opposite direction from Nine and Ten running from himself, from the Time War, from responsibility. And it's also been a minor theme of Eleven's recent relationship with the Ponds, that real life is what goes on when he's not there - again, running away from responsibility.

So like I said earlier, what do we make of this line? Do we like it, does it work, do we believe it? The idea of running to something is very much in the character of the Eleventh Doctor's constant wonderment at the universe, I feel, but his delivery of the line - utterly excellent, I shouldn't have to add - is so uncharacteristic. He's so serious-earnest when he says it, rather than bubbly-earnest; the first time I heard the line, it almost sounded as though he's trying to convince himself that he's not running away. I like the line a lot, and I very much want to believe it. And a good argument can be made that this is just the further evolution of the Doctor's outlook on life and his view of self.

(A response to Human Nature/Family of Blood by /u/Forgotmypasswrd from /r/DoctorWho),60,13,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/18pyia/the_best_two_hours_of_television_ive_ever_seen_a/,"*SPOILERS BELOW*



Thank you, Dr. Who, thank you.

Let me explain. Home on a Saturday afternoon with nothing to do, I turned on Human Nature and The Family of Blood (S. 3, ep. 8-9), fully expecting to be a simple affair where the Doctor and Companion X get into some trouble and make their way out at the last second. I have never been happier to be wrong in my life.

For those who have not seen the episodes, the doctor and Martha are chased by a group of killers but to survive, the Doctor must hide his soul inside an watch while his body lives another life. That body becomes inhabited the persona of John Smith, who develops a distinct personality, morality, and consciousness from that of the Doctor. The program then goes on to explore the nature of existence and sacrifice, and in doing so instills a sense of profound existentialism in the audience.

I've never felt more during a television show before in my life. I saw the life that John Smith had and realized that he was *a real person*, even though he never existed in the 'real universe.' When Martha asked him to change back into the doctor he cringed and said that he didnt want to die, because he didn't want to give up on the future that he knows could happen. He says why would he want to go back to being the Doctor, a lonely man? Why not stay John Smith, the man with a love? Why should his consciousness be replaced by the doctor, who could never feel what John Smith feels? His feelings, his hopes, his dreams, and his weaknesses are all real, but all are extinguished when the doctor re-enters his body.

I thought about the nature of being, about time, about loyalty and love, about the future, and as cliche as it sounds, about the meaning of life. Now I have never been religious and have always held onto the idea that in the world in which we exist, each destiny is self-determined and that therefore we must strive to *achieve* the most that we can. After watching John Smith live out his life from a young man till old age, seeing his wedding and his children, his joys and his triumphs, all the while knowing he was considering giving up all that for the good of others on information he only discovered less than a day ago, after all that, my confidence on this has never been more shaken. We as people could have a key to a device that lets us travel throughout all of space and time, but travelling to the edges of the universe will never make us as happy as feeling the only thing that makes life worth living: love.

Live John Smith, our time on this earth is fleeting. While many of us may imagine a fancy man with a blue box leading us from a monotonous existence to a wonderful adventure, if given that option we may forfeit the one unique thing that makes the interim time between birth and death so special. The doctor lived for thousands of years, and John Smith for merely hours. The doctor saw vast stars and experiences many things, and Smith spent his life as a simple schoolteacher in England. But, John Smith knew what it was to live, while the doctor continues to travel through time. At the end of the day, whose life was better spent?",,False,,t5_2tf29,False,,,True,t3_18pyia,http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/18pyia/the_best_two_hours_of_television_ive_ever_seen_a/,

In my opinion it's the most plausible Clara theory yet. The gist of it is:

- The Doctor takes off the nanogene protective wristband and thus becomes infected with the nanogenes, but has some Time Lord immunity so he is just a ""carrier"".
- Oswin saying ""remember me"" at the end of Asylum of the Daleks was her inserting herself into the nanogenes, in the same way that she is so easily able to hack the Dalek technology.
- If the Doctor stays still for long enough (like he did in Victorian London) the nanogenes will create a new Clara.

Since I consider the TV show as the only true source of canon (if you want to debate that point there's another thread you can visit) and I don't recall an episode stating that she isn't his biological descendant then I think she definitely must be and I'm curious to know why people don't think she is, or more importantly WHY they don't WANT her to be?

As far as I'm concerned the Doctors early years consisted of him going to school, graduating, making a name for himself, popping out a couple of children with a wife (or Gallifreyan equivalent) and then becoming a grandparent before stealing the TARDIS and stepping onto our TV screens for the first time. I have no concerns with that process. I know in the early days the producers didn't want the Doctor to be considered 'sexually active' which is where I think the Susan theories started.

But for me it makes me respect the Doctor more to think he had that life before some mysterious fate befell his child/children and he left everything behind to travel. I actually think it would make a good 50th anniversary story.

So as far as I'm concerned, and until an episode states that Susan was some picked orphan needing a disguise, she will always be considered the Doctor's biological grand daughter. I do believe 10 stated in one episode that he was a 'father once'.

I have a few questions and thoughts, and I figured this would be a fine place to put them. You can reply if you want, but I'm just gonna dump some of my thoughts and some of the things I liked or didn't like. Enjoy. Or not. Either way. 


**Starting the Show and its Strengths**

Nobody told me anything about this show, I only knew that people liked it, so I told myself I'd give it a shot... Nobody warned me that I'd have to scrape my way through the first few episodes (first 4 I think) as they were really not the best, and they were difficult to get into without any prior knowledge of anything. (I bet I'd enjoy them now that I know the characters and what the show is all about) The show starts out really cheesy (which is fine) and doesn't have the best flow... But you start to get to know the characters through relationships that start to form. This is, in my opinion, Doctor Who's strong point. Relationships. The Doctor, the companions, their families and friends... It's all good. 

**Musing on the Episodic Nature of the Show**

So after finally getting into the show a little bit more I had a couple problems. It bothered me that individual episodes didn't seem to necessarily... matter? There are a few blips here and there that carry over, but there was no overlying plot. There were also some really creepy and excellent episodes that I really did not expect. Really good stuff. But still some episodes that really didn't hit home... and I wasn't really sure what to make of the ""first"" (9th) Doctor. 

**Finishing Series One**

It wasn't until we started reaching the end of season one that I really was in love with the characters. Rose was EXCELLENT. The Doctor was great, Jack was great...even the ""background"" characters were coming into fruition in a good way... The last couple episodes of season 1 were REALLY fantastic. Loved it. Rose not allowing herself to be separated from the Doctor, the Doctor trying to hopelessly save everyone be destroying himself... Just all sorts of good. The massive army of Dalek's that were supposed to be extinct made these episodes EXTRA important. The future of the earth was going to be decided in a second. 

The whole ""bad wolf"" thing gave the series some much needed continuity as well. The way it ended was... well... excellent. It was emotional, characters were changing, and the plot progressed in a MAJOR way. Also, Rose was AWESOME. Given all of the power she had, she showed her true self. She was truly good. BUT we were losing the 9th Doctor and he was being replaced with somebody new. Somebody I had doubts about because I liked number 9. Doubts that REALLY didn't last very long AT ALL.

**Series Two**

Season 2 was more of the same hit or miss for me... But again, the best thing about it was the relationships. Rose and the new Doctor had some REAL chemistry, and other characters progressed as well. At this point I assumed that the series was about Rose and her adventures with the Doctor. Again I had the complaint that individual episodes didn't necessarily matter and there were some points that just really didn't hit with me... But again, as the show went on and we approached the end of the season... it just got better and better.

**Losing a Companion**

As I said before, at this point I thought that this show was about the Doctor and his adventures with Rose Tyler. Doomsday came as a... surprise. The finale did not pull any emotional punches, and I was upset. I'm not really a crier when it comes to entertainment, and this wasn't an exception... But it made me.. grumpy. I was grumpy and a bit emotional. Rose was gone, but Rose in my mind COULDN'T be gone and have the show continue. When they said their goodbyes I was even more grumpy and emotional. The Doctor didn't get to tell Rose that he loved her. Upsetting. 

**Series Three**

Season 3... Season 3, season 3, season 3. Evidently my attachment to Rose Tyler at this point was pretty strong. I was upset, he just sort of immediately got a new companion (a Rose replacement?!) and that seemed to be that. I appreciated the fact that he seemed to be hurting at least, although he was kind of unintentionally a jerk to Martha… I spent the first 6 episodes grumpy that Rose ""wasn't back yet"" and that the Doctor didn't even seem to be trying. 

**More on Losing a Companion**

Then I realized... She's not coming back. This show isn't about Rose and the Doctor. It's about the Doctor. It took me that realization to even give our new companion a chance. Martha Jones was fine. She was strong in a different way. Helpful, smart, different. But I was still bitter that there was no Rose. 

This is where things got tougher to keep watching for me. Don't get me wrong, Martha was pretty cool and definitely wasn't like Rose and that's not a bad thing. Here we get more episodes that don't really matter at all, and some good ones. The Doctor himself continues to be fun to watch. The later episodes once again were fantastic. The Master was an excellent villain, and things REALLY escalated in a good way. Still no Rose. Hmm… But a great finale. 

**More Frustration With the Episodic Nature of the Show**

At this point, however, the frustration is growing. We're all the way onto season 4, and most episodes STILL don't matter. When I say that what I mean is that there is no cohesive PLOT to go through from episode to episode. 

This bothers me. It's like watching a kids cartoon where you could simply pop in and out of watching without missing much. Not only that, but the things that they DO build up (the EXCELLENT relationships) tend to be shoved to the side a bit whenever we DO get into something new. BAH. But I press on towards season 4. 

**Donna as Companion**

Season 4 gets us a new companion yet again. Here we have Donna Donna is NOTHING like the previous companions. That is not a bad thing. Their relationship is unique. They don't obviously love each other like Rose and the Doctor did, she doesn't feel like second best and a replacement Rose like Martha did, she's just unique. Through the season you realize the best thing about her is that she's ""ordinary"" and that she doesn't seem special. But oh is she ever special. 

**Series Four Plot**

This season we get hints sort of like the whole ""bad wolf"" thing that something special is going on. It's minor, but it seems like an effort to have plot progression. I approve… and then… We get to see Rose again! Yeah, Rose. I keep bringing her up. I thought the show was about her and the doctor from the start, so leave me alone. haha. 

**Thoughts on the Finale**

Moving forward a bit we get into the AMAZING season finale again. FANTASTIC. Not only does EVERYTHING finally come together, all of the characters all of the relationships all of the companions all of the everything. It ends in spectacular fashion. All of the characters stories are completed. Martha is married and living an adventurous life on Earth… Donna saves everything that ever was and unfortunately has to lose her memories of the previous events to live her life away from the Doctor,  and Rose gets her very own Doctor. EVERYTHING was wrapped up neat and tidy, and it was good. The series could have easily ended right here and now, and it would have been a great ending. 

**Looking back at Series 1-4**

This show just got better and better and better during seasons 1-4. For me, it went from meh, to solid, to actually being pretty good. I still wished that the episodes had more continuity and meaning, but the finales were so good and the relationships were done so well that things were just dandy. The emotional range of the Doctor himself was REALLY impressive. Things were good. 

Here is where I start to have some serious problems. 

**Enter Moffat**

I didn't even like in Season 3 (or 4) when we had to just move on with the new companions, but at least the previous seasons really mattered. The previous seasons impacted the Doctor in major ways and he carried that with him with every passing moment. I watched the specials and whatever was ""in between"" season 4 and season 5. Those were all well and good. HOWEVER when we move into the actual season 5, there is a problem. 

It is as if they stealth re-booted the series. NOTHING that happened previously has any significance at all. None of the previous companions. None of the lessons learned as the previous Doctor… Nothing. I've never seen anything quite like it. 

How frustrating is this? I can't possibly be the only one who thought this. It's not the new Doctor's fault either, he does very well and shows good emotional range, he's unique, it's always fun when he says something is ""cool"" like bow-ties and what not. 

**Moffat's Companions**

So the problem isn't the Doctor. So is it the new companions? Amy Pond is unique, and she's traveling with her husband, so that's a… different… sort of relationship. Rory also DEFINITELY has his moments. Some of the stuff is really cool, the lone centurion for example was really great. He really, REALLY loves Amy Pond. 

And that's great… But wait. I find myself just not caring at all. I just do not care about these characters, I do not care about these episodes, and I do not even really care about the Doctor. Alright, that one might not be true. But I'm just so frustrated. So many things are done wrong in the midst of so many things being done right. 

**Overarching Plots in Moffat's Era**

My previous complaints about episodes not mattering is completely gone in seasons 5 and 6, the overarching stories of these seasons is done VERY very well. It can't be easy to write and overarching story for a time traveling guy who goes from place to place backwards and forwards on whims, but it was done wonderfully. 

The quality of the show had risen, I didn't really notice when it happened but some time ago the series just stopped being cheesy in a negative way. The scale of the episodes was grand and well done. 

**River's Tale and Connecting the Doctors**

River's storyline was REALLY cool. HOWEVER, I find myself not enjoying it nearly as much. They just brushed everything previous under the rug, and I just really do not like that. Yes, the story lines of the previous companions and characters were pretty well completed. It makes sense to not just thrust them into new seasons where that isn't necessary… HOWEVER, the DOCTOR is still here, and because the Doctor is still here, there should be memories… Reflections… SOMETHING that pulls the series together.  

I'm sure that in between this new Doctor Who and the series that existed long long long ago the same thing occurs, there is no reference to much anything that happens before our 9th Doctor… But there is a problem here. THAT was a reboot, and this was just SEASON 5! 

Am I the only one who feels this way? Is the ""fandom"" split? I just can't stand it, and don't have any drive to catch up past season 6. I also feel like season 6 is YET ANOTHER spot where the series could have/should have ended. 

I don't know why I've typed all this up, and I don't even expect anyone to really reply because its so much text, I just figured I'd put down some of my thoughts. 


**TL;DR**:

The series grew a lot on me all the way from season 1-4 in a very good way. I love the relationships that develop between characters, but I'm frustrated by lack of story importance from episode to episode. 

Season 5 feels like a stealthy reboot where nothing that happened before matters. It fixes a lot of the problems that I had with no overarching story, but I find myself not enjoying it as much. The stories of season 5 and 6 were awesome, but COMPLETELY ignore any previous events from seasons 1-4. That frustrates me. A LOT.

I'd like to talk about why I loved his character and why I think he was so important for Doctor Who.

1. Every teenage boy got to live vicariously through him.

How many teenage boys dreamed of the day they'd get to travel with the Doctor? Most of the male companions are too old for the 10-14 year old crowd to identify with, so here was a character for them. He was going through all of the typical teenage coming-of-age troubles you'd expect young viewers to be going through. He was gifted intellectually, but socially awkward. He wanted to be treated like an adult, but still acted like a child, leading him to be rebellious. However, he struggled to impress the ""cool"" older kids, so he ended up feeling like a bit of a social outcast. These are all things boys go through at his age, and while we can hate him from the outside, you know you probably acted a bit like him when you were young (and undoubtedly cringe at the thought).

2. The Doctor got to play the father figure

Adric is struggling for attention, struggling to prove he's smart and brave and cool. Here comes the Fourth Doctor, who is all of these things. Adric finally has someone to look up to, to strive to be like. Many of the previous companions treated the Doctor as a father figure, but Adric and the Doctor shared a more natural bond - Adric wanted to be the Doctor, and the Doctor saw himself in Adric. The Doctor even bragged about him like a son, always mentioning how great he was at mathematics. While I love the Jamie/Two combo, I think Adric and Four/Five shared a more interesting father/son relationship. The relationship was often tried when Adric met other potential father figures like the Doctor, but we see that in the end, Adric was always loyal to the Doctor, and the Doctor to him. 

3. The Doctor needed to lose a companion.

The death of Adric is definitely a traumatizing moment in the life of the Doctor. The Doctor, like Adric, is often over-confident. Up until that point, companions always left in one piece. Adric's death in important because it made the Doctor realize that while he is essentially immortal, his friends aren't. This experience plays a role in his relationship with Amy/Rory/Clara for sure.

4. He could do Block Transfer Computation

That was bad-ass.

&gt;
&gt;Time Lord of the High Council: ""That weapon won't work in here. TARDISes operate in a state of temporal grace.""
&gt;
&gt;The Doctor: ""Well actually, mine hasn't done that for years.""  

You might think that is an odd thing to inform my characterization of the Doctor, but it's not the line itself; it's the implications. When I first listened to this I very suddenly realized that ""the TARDIS operates in a state of temporal grace sounded"" very familiar and it should: that is what the Doctor tells Mels in *Let's Kill Hitler"".

&gt;
&gt;DOCTOR: That was a clever lie, you idiot! Anyone could tell that was a clever lie!

It still may not seem horribly significant, but it made me consciously think about something I had had in the back of my head since I was first introduced to the show: *the Doctor is an alien. No matter how much he may choose to interact with us in our cultural context, it's not his. He has his own culture that takes things for granted of which we could hardly even conceive.*

To a human, ""We are in a state of temporal grace, don't shoot that gun"" sounds like made up nonsense. To a Time Lord, this seems like a reasonable thing to say--something lesser species shouldn't even mess around with to test. The Doctor's cultural understanding is such that he actually did think that was a clever, credible thing to say. That Mels ought to take him at his word in any temporal matter (which is further interesting, because River never does). It snowballs from there, we have no idea what Time Lords think of things like personal space, proper eating habits, or social niceties. The Doctor isn't an average Time Lord by any stretch of the imagination, but his self perception has to be informed by (or maybe it's a reaction to) his culture.

I think that it's been pretty clear that New Who has made many leaps and bounds past the confines of Classic Who most notably being it's incredibly progressive handling of different genders, sexual orientations, species, race, and belief. RTD's work in particular managed to push a message of ""universal acceptance"" without bashing you over the head with it.

I think that [**this interview with Christopher Eccleston conducted before the series aired**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgpT0wjC-iY&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=144s) is particularly insightful on the message of New Who saying:

&gt; The Doctor's message seems to be ""you have a short life, make sure it's a happy one and seize every moment **and accept life in all it's forms**"", which is a central message with him. Y'know he doesn't react with horror when he sees a blue three-headed monster. He reacts with wonder and I think that's a very important message to send out to children.

That theme really resonates with the second episode of the revitalized show, flinging us into a world of the totally strange and bizarre and foreign being accepted and treated as equals. Themes of a highly accepting future come into play and the show handles issues that plagued Classic Who with impressive finesse. For the purposes of brevity I've distilled the broad concepts down to three talking points but you're all welcome to discuss what I may not go deeply into in the comments:

**Women**

Classic Who had a long battle with the underwritten female role. Female companions who served as eye-candy in tight spandex or bikinis who would get kidnapped almost as much as they'd scream. While some of their companions shined as jewels of complexity and self-reliance (Ace, Sarah Jane, Romana) a great deal had difficulty and were often reduced to someone to ""hand the Doctor beakers and tell him how brilliant he is"".

In New Who we really get a full-bodied character through Rose. She has a job, a family, a boyfriend. She has her own fears and desires that actually get explored. Martha is an accomplished medical student who acts as the glue to keep her dysfunctional family together (the fact that she's the first black female companion is another massive step forward as well). Donna is a relateable everywoman in her late thirties. Nothing special about her, not clever, not important, not beautiful or buxom. These characters all get rounded, get explored, and most importantly act as independent partners for the Doctor and not just liabilities.

**LGBT**

Probably the most bold step the show took was it's handling of sexual orientation. Having a pansexual main character (in a children's show) is arguably the biggest step forward the show took. Jack's kiss with the Doctor, a kiss that was genuinely emotionally charged, was not just a step forward for Doctor Who, it was landmark for science fiction as a whole.

Doctor Who is one of the few shows that will frequently include homosexual and bisexual characters and make very little deal of it. The concepts of homosexual marriage is treated as a standard right and their sexual preference doesn't define who they are as a character. The fact that New Who has *consistently* continued this theme is *very* impressive.

**Religion**

Ha! Bet you think I was going to talk about Mickey and the Doctor's Northern accent and all the different cultures that have been steadily better represented throughout the series! But I *didn't!* (Mostly so that someone else can yak about it elsewhere).

Instead I'd like to focus on how Doctor Who has (fairly gradually) gotten more and more talkative on the subject of religion. ""*The Satan Pit*"" actually discusses the Doctor's views on religion (albeit in a rather skittish and indirect way) and ""*The God Complex*"" takes the first major step by showing the clever and independent Rita who is the first Muslim semi-companion.

Overall I'm just bowled over by how casual and effortless Doctor Who is about portraying diversity and I'm glad that it seems this trend will only continue into the show's future.",,False,,t5_2tf29,False,,,True,t3_10s8uh,http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/10s8uh/love_week_part_two_lgbt_portrayal_enthnic/,
1348806672.0,44,self.gallifrey,10lrnv,Want to know the chronological order of Series Seven so far? Here it is.,54,10,44,http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/10lrnv/want_to_know_the_chronological_order_of_series/,"The first and most obvious thing we can ascertain is that ***Dinosaurs on a Spaceship*** **must occur before** ***The Power of Three*** as Brian Williams first meets the Doctor in *Dinosaurs on a Spaceship* and recognizes him in *The Power of Three*.

The second most obvious order is that ***Asylum of the Daleks*** **occurs before** ***Dinosaurs on a Spaceship*** (and thus before *The Power of Three*). We know this because when the Doctor talks to Amy about the modeling job she had she responds by telling him that she quit it. Seeing as we see her having this job in *Asylum of the Daleks* (and other things like how Rory and Amy don't seem to be on the verge of divorce in later episodes) we can safely affirm that ***Asylum of the Daleks*** **happens before both** ***Dinosaurs on a Spaceship*** **and** ***The Power of Three***

The third and likely least noticeable clue is the timing of *A Town Called Mercy*. Now some rumor has been going about claiming that Amy and Rory's ""entirely different clothes"" they return to their friend's reception in in *The Power of Three* are the same as worn in *A Town Called Mercy*. However after double-checking for myself it's clear that [**Amy and Rory are not wearing the same clothes as in** ***Mercy***.](http://i.imgur.com/7O35c.png) However *Power of Three* does have a yellowish cowboy hat with a bullethole in it that is, indeed, [**the same hat as seen in** ***A Town Called Mercy***](http://i.imgur.com/4OnpT.png) (it has a belt on it, which the Stetson Craig gave him does not possess) meaning that ***A Town Called Mercy*** **happens before the scene where you see the hat in** ***The Power of Three*** (this still includes the possibility that it happened during).

And though we can say for absolutely certain that ***A Town Called Mercy*** **happens before the last half of** ***The Power of Three*** we **cannot say for certain that it happened after** ***Asylum of the Daleks*** **or** ***Dinosaurs on a Spaceship***. Meaning that it is the only really uncertain variable on this list, however it **must happen before we see the hat in** ***The Power of Three***.

So our pieced together timeline is as follows:

In the beginning of Matt Smith's run as the Doctor, I was skeptical due to having just watched 3 seasons of Tennant. But the more I watched, the more I realized that I liked MS, but I found it impossible to enjoy Moffat's writing.  This came as an especially huge letdown after ""Blink"" and ""Silence in the Library"".  

Yet I forced myself to watch all of the 5 and the dreadful (IMHO) 6 season.  I tried talking to other friends about it, but they couldn't understand why on earth I didn't worship Moffat.  

I posed this question on /r/doctorwho but was attacked by Moffat fans.  I'm looking for a conversation in which I can find some people that agree with me (or respectfully disagree), and exchange ideas about the flaws in Moffat's writing style.  I don't want to attack the actors or their portrayal of the characters, as that wont get us anywhere. 

I think one of the things that I enjoyed about Classic Who and RTD Who was the extreme character AND arc development, not just a convoluted arc that encompassed some characters that were seemingly already established (Doctor, his companions who you are supposed to like, they go on zany adventures through time, sassy lady who you are supposed to like.) I feel an extreme disconnect from the characters and feel that that has had the most negative impact on new Who enjoyability.  HOWEVER, I could watch ""The Doctor's Wife"" over and over again... 

I hope this helps get a conversation rolling.  

Again, I'm not trying to sling hate, I'm just looking for a conversation. 

Edit: Just to clarify, I know that ""The Doctor's Wife"" is Gaiman. Used a non-Moffat episode to clarify the point made that I like Matt Smith, but not Moffat's writing for him.

This appears to contradict the established timeline of eleven Doctors shown on several occasions in the show. The current explanations for this range from, ""He wasn't acting as The Doctor, so he doesn't count"" to theories involving amnesia.

I don't think these explanations are strong enough. For one thing, it seems incongruous to think the Doctor, after any normal regeneration, would commit an act so atrocious that he would be forced to deny his own self.

So, if the Hurt Doctor isn't the result of 'normal regeneration', what if he's an 'abnormal incarnation'? In particular, what if this incarnation was somehow manipulated to be more ruthless - more of a weapon - than the Doctor, possibly with the explicit intention of putting an end to the Time War.

For example, what if the Timelords decided to force a regeneration, fundamentally altering the personality of the Doctor, with the intention of wiping out the Daleks? Given his past dealing with the Daleks, the Doctor may be the natural choice.

Or, for that matter, what if the Daleks somehow forced a deviant regeneration, with the intention of wiping out the Timelords? To turn the greatest predator of Daleks into their deadliest weapon?

1366332876.0,46,self.gallifrey,1cnazq,"I genuinely believe that bringing back Tom, Colin, Peter, or Sylvester to physically reprise their roles for the 50th is unlikely and an overall bad idea",65,19,112,http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/1cnazq/i_genuinely_believe_that_bringing_back_tom_colin/,"Now please don't downvote based on a kneejerk reaction. /r/Gallifrey was designed for intellectual discussion and debate, and that's precisely what this post attempts to create. 

I'd like to preface by saying I feel that it's *immensely* important for Doctor Who to pay homage to its Classic Era during the 50th Anniversary. It's a culmination of half a century and the content should reflect that scope. Doctor Who did not begin in 2005, and I strongly believe that the work the previous Doctor's did should play a big role or at least be given a huge nod.

That said, I think that it's vitally important to keep in mind that Tom Baker is really the face of Classic Who. When people think of Doctor Who before the reboot, when they close their eyes and picture ""the Doctor"", nine times out of ten they'll see Baker's massive grin wrapped in an enormous scarf.



But Baker [barely resembles his character anymore](http://ww1.prweb.com/prfiles/2011/11/24/8980761/French%20thoughts%20Tom%20Baker.jpg) and Colin [looks absolutely nothing like Six](http://images.ok.co.uk/dynamic/3/451x567/56532_1.jpg). Neither are even remotely fit for a big feature-length shoot, and would barely fit into their old costumes.

Further, I'd much rather have a focus on *story* rather than trying to cram as many characters in as possible. Remember that this feature will already be starring Matt, Jenna, [50th  SPOILERS](#s ""Billie, and David""). That's already a weighty cast of big personas. How much further can the budget be strained?

Doctor Who's about leaping forward and not turning back, now more so that ever. Seeing a badly bloated set of aging actors reprising a role doesn't fill me with joy, it fills me with depression. I know it sounds harsh and even callous but the role's moved on. 

Contrived suspension-of-reality-shattering explanations for their age aside, we really don't need to cart these people out of retirement for the sake of tradition. We need to look at what will create the best possible story.

**PREFACE**

I'd also like to say that other attempts to work around the age issue would result in similar issues. 

I'm sorry, one cannot simply recast Tom Baker. Disrespect aside, there's really nobody capable of accurately duplicating that wholly iconic role. It would be tantamount to recasting Captain Picard, the role's just too intrensically tied to the performance to even contemplate a recast.

So what's the other alternative? Well, there's the route of CGI, but I cannot stress enough that this would be a **terrible** idea. One need only watch Tron: Legacy to see how a *massive budget* production can't get a de-aging done right. I don't want to see a horrifying uncanny valley Doctor.

Voice acting, as the Big Finish audio plays can attest, are certainly an avenue, as are the clever use of pre-existing material, but it would require a ""less is more"" mentality in practice. You would have to limit the Classic Doctor's roles as small as possible.

Overall I see there being one viable Doctor choice. Two, counting McGann (who's unfortunately a bit of a long-shot). That's Tennant. ",DISCUSSION,False,,t5_2tf29,False,h,,True,t3_1cnazq,http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/1cnazq/i_genuinely_believe_that_bringing_back_tom_colin/,

I recently edited the 8th Doctor movie as a way to celebrate the 50th. I feel Paul McGann deserves more props for his superb take on the Doctor (for those who dont follow the audios), and I also wondered what the movie would actually seem like without all the 'stupid' bits. My edit basically took out the initial monologue intro (the story now starts directly after Lee and his cohorts shot at the car which has a result of making him not an explicit gangbanger, and jumping right into the action). I also took out the kisses and dialogue leading into the romance between Grace and the Doctor, the half-human aspect (ugh), most mentions of clairvoyance and the intercutting of the climax with the 30-second NYE parties countdown (leaving just scenes in TARDIS). The theme song intro was also moved to directly after the regeneration scene (which also took out most of the Frankenstein parallels). About 14 minutes were chopped out, and the pacing is much improved as a result. Essentially this is an as little-Will-Sasso-as-possible edit, and the final video actually feels much like a regular old episode of Who that I know and love. 

Long story short, I would love to get the community's reaction on this and share it for your enjoyment, but I am unsure as to the most effective way I could share this without it getting taken down on youtube. Any suggestions? Thanks!

EDIT: For those of you discussing, I edited from a video file directly off the BBC Two-Disc Special Edition DVD. I'm not an editing expert by any means so some edits/audio dont match up perfectly, this was simply an attempt at taking out the things that seem to be the traditional complaints about the movie and what bothered me most. 

EDIT: I did keep the first kiss between the Doctor and Grace, that was a very Doctor-ish reaction. The rest of the needless snogging was what I edited out.

For those who aren't aware of the history for these films, let me give a little bit of the history behind them.

These are two original films made by the BBC that were released in theaters in the 1960's. In these films, the Doctor is oddly not a Time Lord, but simply just a human named Dr. Who.


So why would the BBC make these films that completely ignore the Doctor's backstory from the show? Because while these films do have the Doctor as the protagonist, the Doctor isn't really the main focus of the story. The Daleks are.

During the 1960's Doctor Who was just another average BBC television series. It had it's fans, but it wasn't extremely popular. Then in 1963 the episode ""The Daleks"" aired. These new villains made the series explode in popularity. This caused an phenomena dubbed ""Dalekmania"". The Daleks were everywhere. Merchandising, of course, brought in huge profits for the BBC. Their booming popularity inspired the BBC to create these two films starring Peter Cushing.

Had it not been for the Daleks, the BBC might not have had insert in continuing the series after William Hartnell left. They might have just eventually ended the series. Patrick Troughton might not have taken over as the Second Doctor thus meaning the concept of regeneration might not have been introduced to the series. I'd even say that if it weren't for the Daleks, we might not have had Doctor Who today.

Like, the children being used as drugs, and concentration camps and gas chambers in London or Cardiff or whatever? Would the Doctor do more to step in and save the people of Earth, or would he shrink away, out of shame for human kind? What would his interactions with a companion be like? I always imagine him saying to a companion 'You have no idea how hard it is, living forever, being immortal.', and them retorting 'Well, actually, I do.' I also see him taking the companion to UNIT and that companion freaking out and going berserk, trying to hurt as many higher ranking officials as possible out of revenge.

My second question: In what direction do you think the show would go if Gwen Cooper or Luke Smith became the new companion? I'm a massive fan of both Eve Myles as an actress (Gwen, Merrill, Frankie) and Gwen Cooper as a character, and so I'd love to see more of her. But, Luke Smith is Sarah-Jane's son, he could be very important to the Doctor, who might even become a surrogate dad of his or something. Would either of these two make a change in the show, at least for their runs?

Yes, but he has done it before and given how dreadfully things ended for his last few companions, it could be made clear that its out of his love for them that he abandons them. Because he knows that after a while it will inevitably end poorly for them. If Amy thinks he is dead she wont go out looking for him and we still get a nice tied together ending. Instead we have to waste half the damn season concluding their story line. Yes, I enjoyed some of these episodes a lot, A Town Called Mercy in particular, but the Power of 3 was poor and felt more like a clip show filler than anything else. 

But what did we have to give up for more Amy thinking she is the only person who has ever been important to the Doctor? A full season about Clara. Instead we get a handful of episodes to explain a relatively complicated companion, whose story line rivals River Songs in complexity. If we had more episodes we could have had more individual episodes with new companions. We know know that the Doctor doesn't always find Clara or hear her, so he could be searching for her, not find her, but go on an adventure with whoever happens to be around in the mean time. I still absolutely LOVE The Lodger, why not have another episode or two along that vein? I have always found myself enjoying the infrequent companions a little more than the regulars, not to hate on the regular companions (sorry Rory and Rose!). For example, I enjoy Amelia more than Amy, loved Craig and Stormageddon, not to mention Wilfred. This would have been a great chance to meet new characters and for the show to be creative with who they might be, why not another Alien for an episode? We also could have had more episodes dedicated to Clara in different time lines as different people, or even in the background of his adventures with other companions as she tries to get his attention but he is too distracted to notice. 

Lastly, what I would have absolutely LOVED, during these theoretical extra episodes, is a little more River Song. I mean we have never seen River and the Doctor together just to two of them. Why not an episode or two covering a night out on the town for the two of them, one that ends with him dropping her back off at the prison? I feel that Moffat ended River's time line with Amy and Rory's for no real reason. Nothing says that she had to end right then. I was so happy to see her back during the finale, and that it was post Silence at the Library River was perfect. I just would have loved to see her a few more times, instead of the rather lack luster ending she had in NY with Rory and Amy. 

This is just my dream for a season. I didn't think it was necessary to have a few more average episodes with Amy, who I had definitely gotten my fill of. This, in combination with a rushed explanation of Clara for the conclusion of one of the best story lines, was just a waste. I would also hope that Clara ends here and now, or at least after the 50th. I feel like so many of her questions were answered that this would have been the perfect place to end her. She could have had her 1 season like Martha Jones and then we could have had a complete fresh start after the 50th.

In the original series, it's stated that he was an evil version of the Doctor that was created sometime between his 12 and final incarnation. What if the source of that evil within the Doctor was his exposure to the nanocloud around the Dalek Asylum? He left himself vulnerable to it after giving Amy his protection bracelet. During the time Amy is without her bracelet, she begins to show signs of memory loss and love being replaced with hate. What if The Doctor's memory loss in the latter half of Season 7 and his darker side coming out are the result of his exposure? 
The Valeyard would then be created by The Doctor purging himself of the evil that the Daleks nanocloud introduced during his next regeneration. The Valeyard would likely have the full knowledge of The Doctor and be able to break the timelock (perhaps by using the true name of The Doctor, which he would know), releasing the Time War back into the universe. The Valeyard could then travel back to Gallifrey and set the events in motion for ""Trial of a Timelord"".

And so once again, I apologize for creating a space separate from the main episode discussion to do so, but once again I'd like to focus in on a particular moment.

Around 21:16, the Doctor tells Amy that ""You were the first. The first face this face saw."" And he goes on to explain that he keeps coming back to her because she's been imprinted on this regeneration of himself. And to me, this is a lovely addition to how-regeneration-works-theory, and a very Moffat-esque idea (And yes, I know that he didn't write this one; I can't account for *why* it sounds Moffat-y to me, it just does).

I like the idea, and I'm going to stick with it as being true, or true enough. The Doctor's take on regeneration changes with each regeneration, of course (see Ten's view on regeneration being like dying and having a different man get up and walk away; also true, to an extent, but a much more bleak way of looking at it than I like). But I'm interested right now in retrofitting the Doctor's previous post-regeneration moments to see if we see them differently, in light of this new statement.

That might not make sense, so perhaps I should give an example. So, for example, Rose was the first face that Ten saw, immediately following regeneration. He'd grown attached to her as Nine, but her's was the first face that face saw - she was the one who got imprinted. One of the reasons I like this theory so much is because it helps explain, to me at least, why Ten was so attached to Rose, and why he loved her so much. He liked her well enough as Nine, and maybe there was a little something there or maybe not, but Ten is when their relationship changed definitively in a romantic-attraction direction.

So let's go backwards again, what about Nine? In [The Forgotten](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/The_Forgotten) (haven't read, but have read about), the Tenth Doctor states that Eight died alone. Which is incredibly sad to think about, but that's a different heart(s)-wrenching subject to deal with. But what dose that mean for Nine, then? We don't know enough of what he did prior to meeting Rose (the photos Clive owns aren't necessarily from pre-Rose adventures, because time travel), and looking in the mirror at Rose's flat is apparently the first time Nine has stopped to examine himself. So was Nine able to imprint himself on anyone, and what does that mean?

This is sort of my next point - what *does* imprinting do or mean? My personal theory, unsubstantiated by anything at all, is that imprinting helps to further define the Doctor's new personality - he becomes, a bit like the Tenza, whatever is needed. Amelia needed someone who was brave and approachable to children and just a little bit smoke-and-mirrors distraction-y, Rose needed someone fun and reckless, someone who did exactly what her perception of the Doctor did (Someone who ""doesn't give up, doesn't let things happen,"" someone who makes a stand, who says ""no""), and Ten turned out to be a lot of those things. So what does it mean that Nine may not have had anyone to imprint on? That he only had his previous death to go on, in shaping his personality, I think.

Let's complicate things just once more, because Eight and the TV movie is the only other regeneration and media I can definitely speak to at this point - what does it mean for Eight that Seven also died companionless and the first face Eight sees is his own, in that weird Gothic horror fractured mirror ""WHO AM I?"" scene? What does it mean, that the first face that face saw was... his own?

I have no answers at all past this point, nor any ideas on how to even further retrofit this theory back into Classic or much of the Eighth Doctor's further adventures. I welcome any and all discussion on the matter, however.",,False,,t5_2tf29,False,,,True,t3_10f0j4,http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/10f0j4/imprinting_the_doctor/,

The Eighth Doctor, a Doctor considered by many to be underappreciated and overlooked. This Doctor may have only came to our screens in the aborted 1996 American Television Pilot but flourished in a plethora of expanded universe materials from novels to comics and most notably, audio plays.

But there's an issue with these audio plays, and it's not just their relative obscurity. It's the terribly expensive pricing. 

Ever since I caught word of this audio series I was eager to devour them as I had done with New Who via Netflix. But my excitement was quickly dashed once I looked at the going rates.

Here are the figures:

    Eighth Doctor Adventures - Series 1 (Download):  $40.00
    Eighth Doctor Adventures - Series 2 (Download):  $55.00
    Eighth Doctor Adventures - Series 3 (Download):  $55.00
    Eighth Doctor Adventures - Series 4 (Download):  $80.00
                                             Total: $230.00

Now perhaps comparing it to Netflix's comparatively paltry $7.99 a month (which gives you two years and four months before becoming more expensive than Big Finish) as that is *streaming* and not *downloading*. This is a *huge* difference as with a download you can enjoy watching and rewatching the episodes at your leisure as many times as you'd like for as long as you'd like.

For that let's look at the cost of New Who on iTunes...

    New Who - Series 6 (Download):   $37.99
    New Who - Series 5 (Download):   $22.99
    New Who - Specials (Download):   $23.92
    New Who - Series 4 (Download):   $24.99
    New Who - Series 3 (Download):   $24.99
    New Who - Series 2 (Download):   $24.99
    New Who - Series 1 (Download):   $24.99
                            Total:  $184.86

That's the *entirety* of New Who *with* specials, monster files, Confidential interviews, and featurettes. It's also important to note that while New Who has at least thirteen episodes a season **the Eight Doctor's seasons only contain *eight* episodes (save the fourth season, which has ten).**

But let's assume that you want more than a download. You want a nice physical copy of everything. For that let's compare Big Finish's CD's to New Who's DVDs *and* BluRays.

    New Who - Series 1    (DVD):  $57.95
    New Who - Series 2    (DVD):  $51.76
    New Who - Series 3    (DVD):  $51.32
    New Who - Series 4    (DVD):  $53.93
    New Who - Specials (BluRay):  $40.95
    New Who - Series 5 (BluRay):  $59.95
    New Who - ACC      (BluRay):  $14.94 
    New Who - Series 6 (BluRay):  $63.85
    New Who - TDtWatW  (BluRay):  $16.93
                          Total: $411.58

And now Big Finish...

    Eighth Doctor Adventures - Series 1 (CD):   $95.23
    Eighth Doctor Adventures - Series 2 (CD):   $95.23
    Eighth Doctor Adventures - Series 3 (CD):   $95.23
    Eighth Doctor Adventures - Series 4 (CD):  $142.85
                                       Total:  $428.54

Now here I should note that there are cheaper alternatives to purchasing the New Who DVDs and CDs from other readily available outlets. On Amazon alone I found used and bulk outlets selling the same products for cheaper. Let us also note that I included *all* of the BluRay editions when applicable despite the fact that I could just as easily purchase the DVDs and have sound quality equal or slightly greater to that of the Big Finish productions. Let's also note that the DVDs and BluRays include featurettes, cast and crew interviews, deleted scenes, bloopers, and all sorts of extras that you would not have with Big Finish. Note once again that I am purchasing these items as cheaply as regularly available from Big Finish through their subscription program.

Now I think that the figures speak for themselves, but let me underscore my point: the Eighth Doctor Adventures are far too expensive to be a practical purchase. Unless you've got a disposable income that can allow such purchases it's very unlikely that you'll be able to hear *any* of the Eighth Doctor's adventures *at all*.

Than having said I'm sure one could find both New Who *and* the Eighth Doctor Adventures in their entirety available for download from other... less reputable ports of call.",,False,,t5_2tf29,False,,,True,t3_zh4j8,http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/zh4j8/the_real_reason_so_few_listen_to_big_finish/,

Most people cite the idea that knowing one's future making that future inevitable a change to canon, at least within this series--the Doctor himself says that knowing your future is what helps to avoid it.  Well, I guess that works... but with a few caveats.

When Amy reads ahead in the Melody Malone book, she creates an inevitability.  When Rory witnesses his own death (once the Doctor realizes the man in the room must be Rory, by the nameplate), he creates a fixed point.  When Rory reads his tombstone, he creates another fixed point, and when Amy sacrifices herself after the Doctor reading the chapter titles and noticing Amelia's Last Farewell (or whatever it was), she creates a fixed point.  

What do most of these have in common?

Writing.

History that has been witnessed can be a screwy type of fixed point, allowing some wiggle room to exist (see the Doctor's death at Lake Silencio).  Personal accounts of history that have been written and read are a bit more tricky.  

Even going to the Waters of Mars, when we see the written history of the Bowie Base One disaster it creates a bit of a fixed point.  We see that writing changing, but the foreknowledge of what happens is what causes the Captain to commit suicide shortly after ""escaping.""  

Even the history of River Song depends upon avoiding ""spoiling"" the future.  Were River to tell the Doctor a spoiler, he would probably try to find a way to avoid it (creating a paradox) or try to ensure that it happened (making sure that history was the same).  The same with the Doctor telling River about their past.  I wonder if River mentioning the Byzantium in Silence in the Library creates the eventuality that the Doctor would find a way to that time.  

TL;DR: Reading and witnessing your future makes it a Fixed Point, and this is consistent for Moffat's era because of the rules regarding River's diary.

Edit: Okay, so someone pointed this out to me on one of the cross-posts that it's not so much about the writing as the actual EXPERIENCE and awareness--that if River knows something must happen and makes the Doctor aware of it, his not doing so creates a paradox.  Being aware of and experiencing/witnessing one's own future are the key points more than the writing itself.

I believe that the core difference between the two is that Nine and Ten talk with people, but Eleven just talks to them.

In episodes like Boom Town and Gridlock and so many others you see Nine and Ten just shooting the breeze with their friends. Laughing, enjoying each other's company, in general displaying this realness, this approachability. 

Nine and Ten felt like full-bodied people with a sense of humor and a philosophy and their own likes and dislikes. They've seen Ghostbusters and Back to the Future and The Muppet Movie and they're willing to just plain enjoy being in the company of others. They felt like real people.

Eleven is more of a character. Rarely does he make a *joke* that you laugh at. With Eleven you don't laugh with him so much as laugh at him and his bizarre quirks and offhanded odd remarks.

Come to think of it, I don't believe I've ever seen the Eleventh Doctor laugh at a joke, or out of genuine enjoyment.

Ten and Nine made friends, Eleven just seems to get friends. In Gridlock and The Voyage of the Damned and The End of the World and so many other Nine and Ten stories we see them being amiable and gaining friends. With Eleven he just seems to either already have them (like in A Good Man Goes to War) or he just suddenly attains them offscreen and everybody just acts like they like him without really having much a reason (The Lodger and Closing time provide good examples here).

Just a few theories I've been thinking about when I've had nothing better to do and some ways the discrepencies shown between Victory of the Daleks and Asylum could be explained or expanded. Naturally, the ending to Victory would be spoiled (and probably a little bit of Asylum along with a few other episodes between) so I hope you guys have seen them all. I'm also only going to go off information from the TV series and not the video games. :3

Naturally a lot of this is conjecture, and I'd love to hear opinions on the matter.

1. **The Time War structure**

So, to talk about the Paradigm Empire we need to look at what came before, namely the structure of the Daleks during the Time War. Some would say we can never see the Dalek army from the Time War (the Time War is unfilmable, etc etc), but we do get two *very* good glimpses at the structures of the Dalek armies in the show, the ""rebuilt"" Dalek Empires in Parting of the Ways and Journey's End. Both were built by beings who had just come out of the Time War (Davros from a year after the start, the Dalek Emperor presumably from the end and the burning of Gallifrey/Dalek Fleet), so I think we can kinda take some assumptions from both fleets. 

First we can see that neither really use a planet as a base (yes, the Emperor had the idea of the ""Heaven on Earth"" but that was less strategical HQ and more ""Hey, I'm insane, build me a temple and kill some humans while you do it 'kay? Great"" IMO) but rather specially designed mobile spacecraft (the Emperor's Saucer and the Crucible). From that I think we can see a big part of the Dalek's strategy in the Time War: Instead of being based on a planet (which could be intefered with in the past by the Time Lords by crashing a meteor into it or using supernovae) the Daleks seem to have been based from a large, mobile fleet, probably moving in and out of the Time Vortex often enough to be protected from Time-Retcons by the Time Lords. Another aspect of the Time War was the uniformity, nearly all Daleks were alike because nearly all Daleks had to be soldiers, instead of whatever they would have been otherwise (all Daleks kill yes, but what's the point in cloning many builder Daleks when you could clone Trooper Daleks) the only difference being the extreme higher-ranking Daleks (the Emperor and his Guard for example) same with their spacecraft. They built everything to maximize assault capability since war was their main purpose. And, finally, Time War Daleks ran on background Time radiation, as we see in ""Dalek"", a sensible change from Solar radiation slats.

2. **Rebuilding an Empire**

So, at the end of Victory of the Daleks we have five Paradigm Daleks with a single Progenitor device and a single Saucer's worth of equipment. These are Daleks that haven't experienced the Time War itself so they would only be aware of it through databanks if the saucer even had it, let alone the limits they'd have on Time Travel technology (more on that when we get to the Eternal, but we know they use Time Corridor tech to leave, a decidedly low-tech way to Time Travel as the Doctor says in Remembrance). Obviously, they succeed, but we have to admit they'd have a tough job ahead of them. A few points I want to make here: Resources would have been hard to come by for them.

1. The act of physically building an Empire would be shockeningly hard. Without raw resources with which to build casings and saucers and buildings to house Dalek Scientists, without the raw numbers of Daleks working to build the tools to create those buildings and casings and saucers, etc etc. This is why, I personally believe, the Paradigm Daleks ""set up shop"" on a planet to rebuild, it may have been Skaro (though that would have had to have been later abandoned, and may have been little more than wreckage afer the Time War), it may have been a planet with rich resources, personally I'd give it a name like Edanar but that's my own bad naming scheme, but we'll call this hypotethtical planet the ""Home"" planet be it Skaro, Edanar, or any other planet.

2. The Progenitor especially would have had limited uses to create Paradigm Daleks before it's genetic material would have ran out. Even then, cloning only works for so long before Telomeres start shortening to unclonable lengths. The point I'm trying to make here is that Paradigm Daleks are too precious to be sacrificed as troops (as the Drone's name suggests) and too few in number to build an entire army around. So, the Paradigm Daleks probably would have found a way to ""create"" Daleks from other organic material, such as humans. These Daleks wouldn't have been seen as ""pure"" as the Paradigm Daleks so they were given the old casings (at least physically, I don't think they'd be on the level of Time War Daleks in power personally), with the Paradigm serving as the ""elite"" caste and the RTD casings serving as the lower plebian caste. Not to say they wouldn't be valued, in my mind if a Dalek could prove it's individual worth it would end up higher in the system along with any clones it may produce since it's stock may be taken as more ""worthy"".

3. After using up enough of the Home Planet's resources, the fledgling Empire would start moving across the stars conquering worlds. I'll describe the relation between conquest, civil order and science later but I don't believe the Paradigm would have had the ability to conquer throughout time, at this stage IMO their Empire as a whole would probably be a linear time entity and not a time-travelling empire, though individuals would certainly have had limited travel. Also, I see the Paradigm Daleks being more on par with the TV21 Empire, conquering and waging invasions of entire systems, exterminating or enslaving the local races and using the materials to fund it's conquest of more systems, all the while having a clear goal to reach once more: The ability to have entire fleets conquer the whole of Time. That is where the Dalek Paradigm Empire should be at this stage of the story, in my opinion, conquering systems and returning to being a more linear-time Empire while having individual Daleks and Dalek Squads for Time-orientated operations where the Doctor is involved.

4. The Doctor - In a word, the Daleks are *scared* of him, so much so that we see their alliances just to get rid of him. This is another reason why they don't branch into invading through time; they know they'll get the attention of the Doctor (though the main reason I'll explain in the Eternal's paragraph). Of course, with the events of Asylum, the Daleks will start to branch a little bit at a time into time-raiding and maybe even sending a fleet or two through the Vortex.

3 - **The Triumvirate of the Empire**

Now that we have the goals and methods of the Empire out of the way, let's talk about the way the Empire is organized. In my opinion the Dalek Empire should be split into three core constiutants of the Empire, each with a goal, a leader and/or council, and a set of responisibilities. I'll state the sector of the Empire each third is responsible for, and who calls the shots in each. All three of the Sectors need the others to succeed yet all three have infighting with the other two, the leaders of which are in practically open competition so that the overall Dalek Paradigm Empire has no single ruler or group of rulers working in tandem, but works forward due to the most efficient or succesful strategy or strategist finding it's way to the surface.

First Sector - **Internal - Imperial Control - Led by The Parliament of the Daleks**

This is the core of the Empire, it controls everything the Empire's worlds do. We see the Parliament in Asylum being concerned with a planet already owned by the Daleks, and that's it's job. It concerns itself with slaves, resource collection, creation of infrastructure, defense from attackers for colony worlds, and any other issue that may arise. Of course, the Parliament alone doesn't make up this sector but it is the ultimate power in the First Sector. The Parliment itself is made of individual Daleks, called ""Consuls"" whose worth has been proven in it's field, either by a Strategist successfully invading a system with a minimal resource use, or a Scientist successfully creating a new type of defense system for an entire planet. These Daleks may come from any of the Three Sectors, and it is a great honor amongst them to join the Parliament. Out of each of the numberless Daleks invited to the Parliament, the most prestigious amongst them is chosen to become the head Dalek of the Parliament (roughly translated to ""Prime Minister"") who sets the issues for which Daleks debate and reach a concensus via the ""Concensus"", a low-range pyschic field that permeates the Parliament so that the Dalek Consuls can communicate via thought. Speaking aloud is usually only done to non-Dalek parties inside the Parliament such as slaves and hollowed out Puppets, though a Dalek Consul who speaks aloud about a topic to the rest of the Parliament is the equivilent of our MPs shouting at each other over rabble in the Houses of Parliament. The Parliament is also unique in that the members are turned over most, with a replacement rate of once every ten years. This is to ensure no one Dalek has more power over the internal Empire than any other Dalek, a sharp contrast to the Second Sector. In my mind, the Parliament is usually held on the Home Planet but in Asylum the Saucer Parliament was used to bring the Doctor to the Asylum personally, it is not the rule.

Second Sector - **External - Invasion Force - Led by the Dalek Emperor**

This Sector probably seems a lot more exciting than Daleks deciding the tax on bins, this is the Invasionary Force. The Daleks' fleets, ships, and armies are commanded by an elite group of strategists and generals who are lead by the Dalek Emperor, a ruthless and strategic Dalek who is permenantly sealed inside a battle computer casing in the spearhead ship of the Empire's fleet. I see this Emperor less as the Parting of the Ways Emperor and more like the Emperor from Evil of the Daleks, physically it looks as if he is a spider in the center of a web, waiting and planning each strike with a cunning viciousness. The Emperor is always there at the Vanguard of any and all invasions, stragegizing and ordering forces around initially and then waiting in silence as the invasion goes off successfully. A noteworthy thing about the Emperor is that instead of multiple Emperors or a successive line of Emperors, the Emperor is constant, being replaced by his own clones and having an extensive DNA reserve on the Home Planet for recreating him (in my mind, the Emperor was originally the first Supreme from Victory of the Daleks) The Dalek army in itself is naturally strong either invading systems by force, hurling meteors into planets whose races show resistance yet do not offer any mineral tactical advantadge. The Second Sector also takes care of cases which need to be descretely and carefully taken care of instead of sending a whole army. Finally, a small but important part of the Second Sector is Time Exploration, the operations in Time which must be surgical.

Third Sector - **Scientific - Imperial Technological Development -- Led by Head Scientist** *

The Third Sector is less focused on the Empire as a whole machine and more of the cogs that make the machine. The Third Sector is the overarching term for the Dalek groups scattered across the Empire, on the Homeworld, on the frontliine saucers, and on specialised research outposts, who research and discover all the Empire's technology. From manufacture of Dalek Casings to researching weaponry to even attempts at Time Travel, the Third Sector develops, manufactures and researches everything the Empire needs, which is then put into practice by the First or Second Sectors depending on what the technology is.

As you'll see, I put a ""led by Head Scientist\*"". This is because, honestly, it could be one of three ideas for the Third Sector. The First, and perhaps most obvious, is Davros. He's always seen as a scientist, and he's often seen in direct competition with the Emperor or Supreme he's up against. But, I don't think we'll see Davros anytime soon, or at least not as a regular enough to give this position to him. The lead scientist could be a single Dalek, who would be bred specifically to think less like a killer Dalek but more as a scientific sapient being, similar to the Cult of Skaro, but I'd imagine a lot less stable mentally. Perhaps named Yttral to make the Second Empire homage complete. Or, finally, it could be a council but I think there's enough councils in this convelouted mess.

The Great Intelligence gains its form from feeding off of the thoughts of creatures. In the Christmas special, for instance, they formed the shape of snow/snowmen due to Richard E. Grant as a child first coming into contact with the GI while building a snowman.

So then I thought, where have we seen a creature that was based off of the thoughts of people, and I suddenly remembered ~~Zagreus~~ the Shakri from The Power of Three. Supposedly, from what The Doctor has told us, the Shakri are merely supposed to be part of children's bed time stories on Gallifrey, yet there they were.

So, could this possibly be a sign that the GI had been to Gallifrey, fed on the fears and thoughts of the Time Lords, and focused itself into the shape of the Shakri? Perhaps, considering the nature of the GI, it was able to force its way out of the Time Lock.

_____________________________________________________________

Presumably if you're reading the Doctor Who subreddit then you like the show. That said, that doesn't mean there aren't things about it that irritate you and you'd like to see change. If you could talk to the creators of the show and get them to change it accordingly, what would you tell them in order to make Doctor Who better?

For me:

**1)** Quit using [deus ex machina](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deus_ex_machina) ALL THE TIME. It seems that over half the episodes since the reboot have ditched creating satisfying plot resolutions in favour of making-shit-up-as-we-go-along. A good ending should make me go: ""Ahhh, I should've guessed that!"", not ""Wtf just happened?!""


**2)** Try and tone down the cringe a little. I have nothing against emotional scenes, and sometimes they are handled brilliantly, but at other times it seems the more tender scenes involve being violently beaten over the head with cliches (the greatest criminal being Russel T Davies).  I've said this before, but Russel's scripts often seem to descend into what I would expect from a doctor who fan fiction, with [this scene](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdeF8eg8bIU) summarising perfectly almost everything I didn't like about his writing style.  Having built up tension for three whole episodes, he resolves it by having the public chanting 'doctor' repeatedly, only to have the doctor begin flying, sprouting some science jargon at the master, who has at this point become some whimpering disney-like villain, and then the doctor proceeds to use some kind of unexplained telekinesis to disarm the master. The whole thing is ridiculously over the top, and hard to watch.


**3)** This goes to Moffat: usually a good idea executed with simplicity is better than tons of good ideas shoehorned into one episode.  One of your greatest strengths as a Doctor Who writer is your ability to come up with tons of imaginative ideas and obscure ideas, the kind that doctor who thrives on.  The first episode you wrote 'The empty child' and 'The Doctor Dances' is a great example of taking one brilliant and imaginitive idea (gas masks that spread via touch) and making sure you utilise the idea as well as possible. Some of your more recent episodes have too much shit going on. The Silence were truly inspired monsters, yet I felt 'The Impossible Astronaut' and 'Day of the Moon' did not reach their potential, as the Doctor's death scene and Amy's discoveries made the plot feel bitty and less satisfying.


**4)** This also goes to Moffat: Stop writing all your female protagonists the same. It's not that I don't like women who are feisty, assertive and flirtatious, but why does every woman have to be that way?  Also, it seems with every passing episode the script seems to incorporate an increasing amount of one liners into the dialogue, and recently its as if entire conversations can just be a string of witty one liners. Whilst this is often highly entertaining, it does somewhat destroy any realism and can make situations less believable.


**5)** And just to reiterate what every fan has already screamed a thousand times already, stop using the sonic screwdriver as a magic wand to get out of tricky situations.  (Refer to my first point if you don't understand why this is annoying).

Obviously I don't think they should ever SAY his name, that would just be the show shooting itself in the foot, but I do think they can play around with the idea of what his name means.  Through out the whole series (the new run especially) They've played up the idea that the Doctors name is more than just a name.  They basically come out and say it in the fires of Pompeii.  So why waste such good set up?  They should play with that concept for the 50th and if they are this is how I think they should do it.

Let's go back to before The Doctor was born.  Galifrey is in a crisis, Time is falling apart at the seams.  They've been meddling with time to much and are now paying the consequences.  Moffat could even work this into the Cracks if he so wished.  Now lets say the only way to mend the universe is to enrapture all of time into one being, make them the epicenter of all time and space.  They take a Time Lord baby, The Doctor, and do this.  Time is safe as long as no one utters the name of the infant which could possibly mean The Doctor doesn't even know his own name, but that's only if you want to take it in that direction. They could work this all into the prophecy, the fields of Treselor and all that, and make one hell of a 50th.

I've always felt that Doctor Who, being the time-travel based show that it is, has a great opportunity to tell a story similar to this (and flirted a bit in doing so with *Remembrance of the Daleks*).

This allows not only for some interesting contemplation on the Doctor's part, looking back at how he used to be, but it also gives a reminder to the scope and history of the show as well as allowing a bit of a ribbing at the show's more dated qualities (I'd actually like to see Murray Gold attempting a soundtrack in the style of Classic Who).

What made the Simpsons last twenty-three seasons and made The Greatest American Superhero last longer than it's pilot? 

That's right— A great theme song.

Say what you want about amazing acting, scripts, direction, and an adaptive ability to change literally everything about itself but it is the *theme* that keeps shows on the air. Don't believe me? Name a long-running show with a terrible theme song. Ha! You *can't!* 

[**1963-1967 \(First Doctor\)**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?fmt=18&amp;gl=GB&amp;hl=en-GB&amp;v=3dEHeWWE10g)

Composed by [**Rob Grainer**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Grainer) and realized to electronica by [**Delia Derbyshire**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delia_Derbyshire) (whose pioneering of a psychedelic, smooth techno soundscape was *miles* ahead of her time) this theme lets the four beat take full precedence. It's such a mysterious theme for such a mysterious character and sets the precedent for *every* theme to follow.

In my personal opinion it's this theme's stark simplicity that makes it so splendid. This is probably my favorite theme for that very reason. It's also interesting to note that this televised version is only one [**of**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?fmt=18&amp;gl=GB&amp;hl=en-GB&amp;v=EwUgh073qqE) [**three versions.**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?fmt=18&amp;gl=GB&amp;hl=en-GB&amp;v=yuzrBDXjgZ0)

[**1967-1970 \(Second Doctor\)**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?fmt=18&amp;gl=GB&amp;hl=en-GB&amp;v=Pi_aPoaK4Tg)

The theme gets a bit more busy and adventurous with a more busy and adventurous Doctor. The theme stretches out with a few more garnishments but holistically not much has changed.

[**1970-1980 \(Third Doctor and Fourth Doctor\)**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?fmt=18&amp;gl=GB&amp;hl=en-GB&amp;v=Pi_aPoaK4Tg)

The drums are slightly (very slightly) toned down in favor of the thermin in this theme. It's also interesting to note that for [**one time only**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51m7cnwoiog&amp;list=PL13B12073A834A439&amp;index=6&amp;feature=plpp_video) this theme was aired with a cool (possibly accidental) ""stutter"" in *Spearhead from Space*.

[**1980-1985 \(The Fourth and Fifth Doctor\)**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?fmt=18&amp;gl=GB&amp;hl=en-GB&amp;v=v2oCK89xxNQ)

Knock-knock. Who's there? It's *the friggin' eighties*. 

[**Peter Howell**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Howell) knocks it out of the park with this amazingly bold reinterpretation of the theme, introducing an *electric friggin' guitar*. For many this is the embodiment of Who in the eighties and for some it's their favorite rendition of the theme *of all time*. It got a slightly different variation just [**a few years later**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CyS7IQ_Qw4&amp;feature=bf_next&amp;list=PL13B12073A834A439)

[**1986 (The Sixth Doctor)** ](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcTl9cczMSY&amp;feature=BFa&amp;list=PL13B12073A834A439)

A warped an distorted theme for a warped and distorted Doctor? (I think I'm getting too complacent in my analogies). This one's a little less bold and triumphant, perhaps attempting to dial back and mirror the unexpected nature of this brief Doctor.

[**1987-1989 (Seventh Doctor)**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?fmt=18&amp;gl=GB&amp;hl=en-GB&amp;v=rDK_2ZB4_xs)

I like this one. It's doing just enough with itself to be like Peter Howell's first works but the focus on the (synth?) piano makes it a bit different, a bit less noisy.

[**1969 (Eighth Doctor)**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?fmt=18&amp;gl=GB&amp;hl=en-GB&amp;v=40dewhJkGpQ) 

For one night only we got a new Doctor with a new theme. A new *fully orchestrated* theme. This theme's also noteworthy for *coming in* with the more heroic ""Eight Bar Melody"" that's normally only heard in the closing credits.

[**2005-2007 \(Ninth and Tenth Doctor\)**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?fmt=18&amp;gl=GB&amp;hl=en-GB&amp;v=uRE1aOogdPI)

You all know this one! I've spoken on how amazing Murray Gold's rendition was in an earlier post so I won't be gushing too much here suffice to say that this theme is *amazing*.

[**2007-2010 \(Tenth Doctor\)**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O34Por_fqQU&amp;feature=BFa&amp;list=PL13B12073A834A439)

Bit of a subtle change here but for the good Doctor's last hurrah Murray Gold redid the theme, introducing drums and an electric guitar into the mix. The effect is quite epic.

[**2010-Present (Eleventh Doctor)**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV6bbP1rZ84) 

Here we are, the present. In many ways it's quite divergent from prior themes (slow build, much more orchestral) but in others it's a return-to-form (reintroduction of a thermin). A brilliant theme from any angle.

Welcome to The Travels of A Time Lord, where a renegade reddit poster decided to take the classic Doctor Who streams series and travel the Whoniverse with it. 

I'm going to separate the streams into a season of 7 classic stories, each with their own twist, in which I'll have one story a week for you to enjoy. We should get at least two seasons done this summer.

In addition, I'm going to ask that everyone live post to the thread with episode comments as they happen with an episode marker (like ""Episode 3-"" as opposed to just giving an episode a run down summary/review. It'll help people to space out the episode for pacing purposes and help to avoid ""Classic Who Marathon Fatigue"".

The twist to this series is that to this series, we're going to be looking at major turns of character for The Doctor through each of his incarnations. Each of these stories will feature a dramatic change in the Doctor's character from the previous episodes, and in the mean time will provide a brilliant jumping on point for those looking for something more than the first episode.

With the exposition out of the way that I'll probably never do again, here's our first story: The Dalek Invasion of Earth 

Watch it here: http://www.dailymotion.com/playlist/x2cgxh_WHOat50_the-dalek-invasion-of-earth/1#video=xvexgf

Why you should care:This is famously the point at which The First Doctor went from a jerk who kept getting himself into worse and worse situations into the full blown hero that we know him to be today! It more or less rewrote the entire series into the show we all know and love. 

Now, I've never seen this story, so I'll be posting in the comments alongside all of you. Feel free to post your thoughts going into the episode. As a general warning, spoilers won't be marked through the thread.

if the great intelligence knew so much of the doctor and his future, then it makes sense for him to know of Clara, multiple ones at that since he would have encountered her during the events of the snowmen and the bells of saint john. seeing her at trenzalore would tell him exactly what she is and how she could be possible, therefore letting him know that his ruse was going to fail because of her.

what I think the GI's plan actually was ties into John Hurt's ""doctor"". when Clara was done in the time stream she found herself in some sort of doctor limbo. it only makes sense for the GI to have ended up here as well. what if his plan wasn't to kill the doctor but to imprint himself into the doctor's memories to trick him into thinking that john hurt is a ""forgotten"" doctor when in reality its really the GI pretending to be a doctor? he spent time in the doctors time stream so its safe to say he couldve rewritten a complete history of this ""doctor"" and 11 would believe it actually existed.

this finale wasn't a real finale. the 50th will be the finale.

[Spoilers for Bells of St. John]",64,21,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/1bexc1/about_the_sixteen_i_might_have_figured_it_out/,"Clara's (the Victorian one at least) birthday was at **23** November. Now, there's a tendency (obviously caused by production issues and the inability of BBC to see into the future) that the Doctor follows along the timeline on a straight line when dealing with late 20th and the 21st century, or when Doctor Who is and could be airing. It would be a bad idea for example to set a Fourth Doctor adventure on the early 2000s for example, because they have no idea what would happen then, and DW might still be running. So when the Doctor time travels into the future, it's mostly far enough from the present time.

Now, based on that, I think it's safe to assume that the latest episode was set in 2013 also. Which means, when Clara was 16, it was 2004 (remember that her birthday is on 23 November). In other words, judging by that tendency I said earlier, it's on the end of the Eighth Doctor's era. Time war. Also, 16 years before Clara's 24th birthday was 1996, or the year the TV movie was released, which was the start of the Eighth Doctor's era. But that one is probably just a coincidence.

(This one is completely unrelated to the above, and probably pretty stupid, but what if the lost 16 and 23 refer to the age where the Doctor meet the previous Claras? Yes, Clara doesn't seem to be 16 in either ""Asylum"" or ""Snowmen"", but neither does the girl on ""The Doctor Dances"" seemed like a mother, which was also a Moffat episode. So what if that this new Clara is the original Clara (seeing she had a childhood from the prequels), and she somehow ""lost"" her age because she appeared on different time periods.)",,False,,t5_2tf29,1364813294.0,,,True,t3_1bexc1,http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/1bexc1/about_the_sixteen_i_might_have_figured_it_out/,

I get that the cast majority of the creative style and structure of the show come from the writers and producers. I even understand that the vast amount of the episode's cinematography is determined by the arguably even more underappreciated director of photography.

But by the same token, many fans treat them as if they're totally non-existent. If the Doctor quips a splendid line and get in terrific banter with a companion it's the actors that get showered in praise. If it's a tense scene where every word falls heavy with meaning everyone praises (or damns, if the scene falls flat) the writers.

But I argue that the directors pull much more of their own weight and really should be given a *huge* pat on the back for making Doctor Who what it currently is.

So much of the written dialogue in Doctor Who is clunky, expositional, and cliche. A huge amount of the show's success depends on how these frequently on-the-nose scenes can be executed well. 

I mean, just take a look at this:

&gt; OLD AMY: Okay, Doctor, Two-Streams is back on air. Right, okay, so this is big news, this is temporal earthquake time. I am now officially changing my own future. Hold on to your spectacles. In my past, I saw my future self refuse to help you. I'm now changing that future and agreeing. Every law of time says that shouldn’t be possible.

Bit on-the-nose, particularly that last bit underscoring how impossible this is supposed to be (which has already been well established), but hey: you want to recap and make it clear what we'll be doing next.

&gt; DOCTOR: Yes, except sometimes knowing your own future is what enables you to change it, especially if you're bloody minded, contradictory and completely unpredictable.

Okay, a silly quip from the Doctor. It's exposition, but it's dressed in a joke so I suppose—

&gt; RORY: So, basically, if you're Amy, then?

Um, yes. That's the joke. Amy's stubborn, let's not—

&gt; DOCTOR: Yes, if anyone could defeat pre-destiny, it's your wife.

Gah! Yes, thank you for that joke. It was great to hear the punchline three times.

This is just one example (and possibly not even the best example). Here's another highlighting a different facet of the directing versus the writing:

&gt; RIVER SONG: 
Look at you! You're young.

&gt; DOCTOR:
I'm really not, you know.

&gt; RIVER SONG:
No, but you are. Your eyes. You're younger than I've ever seen you.

&gt; DOCTOR:
You've seen me before, then?

&gt; RIVER SONG:
Doctor... please tell me you know who I am?

&gt; DOCTOR:
Who are you?

Very important sequence to the episode, very easy to write. Doctor Who actually has quite a few scenes where there's not too much dialogue aside from quick back-and-forths. But the power of the scene comes for the delivery, from the *direction*. A massive amount of Doctor Who depends on this. *Vincent and the Doctor* is a great example of the direction being more vital than the writing.

Now I know the lines of what's the director's handiwork and what's the actors are *extremely* blurred, but there's a clear effort behind the scenes there that I'd like to take a moment and appreciate.

First off, what was up with the Weeping Angels?  Doesn't an image of an angel become an angel?  Besides the obvious ""the wrighters didn't want this to become an Angel episode"" excuse is there any actual explanation for why the angels didn't come to life?  Also why was it Gibbis who saw the angels?  That was kind of weird.  

This one is more of an observation than a question.  I know there has been discussions on this sub-reddit about what was in the Doctors room and while I don't have any concrete theories on this I did notice something.  The sound in his room sounded exactly like the Cloister Bell.  Just something to think on.

My last question has to do with the prison (hotel) itself.  We know that some type of Society built the prison to get the creature away from there planet so why then would they have it snatch up people?  I know the beast feeds off of peoples faith but why would they want to keep it alive?  Just let it die out there in space!  Any theories?

Feel free to correct me, as I don't claim to be an expert on the timey wimey stuff. :)

So the premise is this. When the Doctor leaves the Tardis with his companions they become locked in time. That point in time will happen, always happens for the Doctor and nothing can change it. 

With that in mind, let's say he takes a companion from a later point of life. Drops in to say ""Hello"" with them and instigates a situation that prevents that moment in time from being changed by anyone.

After that, he can then travel to earlier in that companions timeline and go on journeys (i.e. Meet them for the first time), safe in the knowledge that they can't be killed, and by extension he can't be killed either.

Which would explain his indifferent attitude to danger. You could say he even orchestrates some of it a little to give the companion the illusion of free will.

In the final episode of 10th doctor we have him sacrificing his regeneration to save Wilf. Before he does that he complains about how Wilf had to step in that box and lead to this situation. The point is somebody had to be in there all the time, so if it wasn't for Wilf, another person would be trapped there. Do you think that Doctor's decision would be any different then?

**EDIT:** I have to admit, that I wrote somewhat enigmatic and too short opening post, because I was on a train and I wanted to write it down before it got away from me. The reason I found this especially interesting is that I don't recall anything similar to happen throughout all the modern series (admittedly I haven't watched classic ones yet). Nine sacrificed his regeneration and was willing to sacrifice his life for Rose. Ten himself was willing to die for example in the library. The thing is, it always involved someone he cared about or at least had some time to get to know. Now imagine this situation: a complete stranger, someone absolutely not important (yes, I know what 11 said, but I recall 10 calling someone unimportant at least twice) is in a death trap and the only way of saving him/her is to sacrifice his regeneration, which he grew really fond of and was really scared of losing. It's far from obvious for me.

now if we think about the oddity that is clara, the fact that she appears to be the ""same"" person with a similar personality in multiple periods of time we need to ask what race of beings have the capability to make something like that even happen. timelords, quite obviously and the outside possibility is the silence. and with her appearing just before the lead up to the 50th brings about all sorts of possibilities, none of them good.

if her existence is somehow the result of the timelords, in some attempt to yet again try to get out of the time lock, then it makes sense for her to be a mystery that the doctor will unravel until he finds out the horrifying truth behind her, which undoubtably will come too late which would lead into a 50th anniversary special where the multiple doctors try to save/stop her while trying to prevent the return of the timelords. plus this gives us the chance to see any earlier incarnations of the doctor oppose this action since they don't see the timelords the same way that 9, 10 and 11 do. plus it gives you the opportunity to see the doctor face off against himself which his always been his greatest foe.

now, if oswin is a creation of the silence it would also make sense since they want the doctor dead and their previous attempt failed. what better way to kill the doctor than to trick him into taking the cause of his demise on as a companion? she's a trojan horse. this of course would also lead into a possible 50th plot. the fields of trenzalore where the doctor is on trial and the previous doctors are brought in and put on trial as well.",THEORY,False,,t5_2tf29,False,c,,True,t3_15m3ha,http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/15m3ha/yet_another_oswin_theory_as_if_there_arent_enough/,

This seems like a big difference between Davies era and Moffat era stories. Moffat seems to rarely kill groups of civilians. In fact, he sometimes goes out of his way to unconvincingly avoid it (ex. Power of Three when tons of people ""die"" but then come back to life). Do other people find this the case as well or am I forgetting some major Moffat events?

If this is the case, what are the benefits or disadvantages of both approaches?

Who is he?  How does he fit in?  Well, this is just me thinking out loud, so the amount of coherence in this theory may vary.  Naturally, spoilers follow.  Also, spoilers for the webcomic ""The Ten Doctors"" follow, if you ever plan on reading that.

One thing people noticed about Doctor Malpractice (or whatever you want to call him) was his outfit.  It seems to be an amalgam of McGann and Eccleston's garbs, leading to the theory that Hurt happens between them, who fights in the Time War, and actually is the one who ends it.  But what if it is more than that?

A while back I read a fan webcomic called ""The Ten Doctors"", (entertaining read, highly recommend it), and at one point, there's a whole ""Journey to the Center of the Mind"" in which all the minds of all the incarnations of the Doctor merge together into one telepathic representation of the Doctor.

We've also heard it said that the Valeyard is the aggregation of all the negativity of the Doctor incarnated in a single body.  You probably see where I'm going with this.

Well, as we know, the Time War was, well, not a good place to be.  Millions were dying, being erased from history, being written back in, only to be killed again.  However, it was also a war ACROSS time, involving Time Travelers.  McGann, being clever while trying to fight the war, decides that maybe it is time to call in reinforcements.  So he manages to recruit others of himself.  Maybe all of himselves.  Selves that were, some that never existed, some that might never be (which could sort of lead into part of the 50th, but we'll burn that bridge when we come to it).  But having multiple Doctors on hand is not enough to solve the problem of the war, to preserve all those lives.  And then (because as we know, the Doctor does have a bit of an ego when he doesn't have someone to ground him), one of them gets the idea that, ""Hey, if all of us come together, literally, maybe we'll be more than the some of our parts.  After all, we're good and fantastic and whatnot.""  So, using whatever technology created the Valeyard, they merge ALL of the Doctors together, believing they'll create the Ultimate Good who can CURE the problem of the Time War.

Only they don't.  The creation, the sum total of the Doctor's experience, his personalities, his endless potential lifetimes, does not end up creating a kindly, benevolent wizard who can just solve the war with a wave of his hand and have everybody live.  Because war isn't that easily solved.  This amalgamation turns out to be ruthlessly pragmatic, authoritarian, cold.  He attempts to solve the war turn out to be far worse than the war itself.  And its not just his actions that terrify the later unmerged Doctor.  The fact that his sum total ends up as a complete monster terrify him, shakes him to his core.  After all, how would you feel if your entire lifespan was summed up and you found that the evil outweighed the good?

And that's who Hurt is.  He is ALL of the Doctors that ever were, ever will be, ever might be, and never existed, all rolled into one ruthlessly pragmatic package.

My main problem with this theory is one people have mentioned about other theories:  The Doctor has spoken about the Time War before, and whatever it is that Malpractice did, it is something he really, REALLY doesn't want to talk about.

1362439965.0,36,self.gallifrey,19o4ck,"My theory regarding The Question, Silence Will Fall, and the 'Doctor Who?' arc.",53,17,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/19o4ck/my_theory_regarding_the_question_silence_will/,"Okay then, first post on this board, so let's see how it goes.

Right, we all know that Silence Will/Must Fall when the Question is asked. We know that the Question is most likely ""Doctor Who?"" This is the basic plot of the arc spanning from ""The Eleventh Hour"" right the way up to ""The Snowmen"" and most likely leading all the way up to the 50th Anniversary/Series 7 finale.

My theory is that The Doctor and Clara will end up on the Fields of Trenzalore at some point very soon, the place where no living creature can speak falsely or fail to answer. It is here that the question ""Doctor who?"" will be asked, by who, I do not know. But, think about it; since ""The Wedding of River Song"" The Doctor has been erasing himself from every data bank in the universe. Even 'Future Oswin' deleted the Daleks' memory of him, he is becoming more and more unknown throughout the universe. This HAS to be leading to something, and as always with Moffat, it probably is.

I think that when The Doctor reaches the Fields of Trenzalore, the Question will be asked, and not a single person in the universe will know, also questioning ""Doctor Who?"". This includes River Song, who at this point does not know The Doctor's name. Yet.

Now, The Doctor's real name obviously has some serious meaning and implications. Personally, I think that he used his name, the one thing that could not be taken away from him, and has so much meaning, his entire identity, and sacrificed it by using it (somehow) to lock the Time War. Now, how do you unlock a lock? You use the same key. That's right, his name will unlock the Time War.

BUT, only by The Doctor saying it himself will the Time War be unlocked. Anyone else can say it all they want, which explains why River is able to tell 10 in 'Silence in the Library' and his reaction is one of horror, he KNOWS that for her to know his name, HE would have to have said it, meaning that at some point in his future the Time War will be completely unlocked.

SO, when the Question is finally asked, The Doctor will be the only person able to answer, unlocking the Time War, as no one else will know his name and be able to answer it for him. The tragedy then comes from the fact that it was The Doctor's own doing that has lead him to this. He has been erasing himself from data banks everywhere, causing knowledge of him to become lost.

Now, we know Silence MUST Fall, this is literal silence, and it MUST fall to protect the universe from whatever horror's the Doctor's greatest secret hides. The hypothetical phrase could be 'Silence must fall or the universe will perish' or something like that. This is why THE Silence (religious order) and Silents (alien race) want to kill him, to STOP the unlocking of the Time War.

TL;DR The Doctor will unlock the Time War by answering the Question, because he will be the only person who knows the answer.

Right, think I made that clear enough, sorry if it's sporadic or convoluted, but I'm totally set on this theory and also excited for the discussion!",,False,,t5_2tf29,False,,,True,t3_19o4ck,http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/19o4ck/my_theory_regarding_the_question_silence_will/,

I don't know if I think he should move on. I'd like to see him start a fresh new season after this one, personally. Often the fact that no one knows who would even take over- I think this comes from the fact that no one is really familiar with the writers. 

I would nominate [Toby Whithouse](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0925980/). If you ask me, he has written the best episodes during Moffat's time and he also has the experience from Being Human as showrunner/creator. He seems to be perfectly suitable to me and he also walks a very similar line between fun/whimsy/drama that RTD did. Not to mention that he has been around since season 2 so he knows everyone and the culture at the production. 

Here are the episodes that he has written:

* School Reunion

* Vampires of Venice 

* God Complex

* Town Called Mercy (my favorite episode since midnight that wasn't a guest writer like neil gaiman or richard curtis)


I'm just curious what other people think about him in general, because I haven't seen his name mentioned once here and I just think he is fantastic. About the title, I wrote that because he seems to have a past that is pretty similar to Moffat's. Regardless, Whithouse is a name you should remember and get excited by when you see it in the title credits.

Myself? As much as I love the current Moffat days (yes, come at me with bashing, I've loved everything from series 5 to now), my pick is the Hinchcliffe/Holmes era, seasons 12 to 14. Short as it was, it was fantastic; a series of adventures that took dark, adult themes and Gothic Horror elements to create some of the most unique television ever. The Fourth Doctor, with either the wonder that was Sarah Jane or the badass breath of fresh air that was Leela, was always on top form, and these seasons illustrate why he is one of my favorite Doctors. 

I'm also completely in love with the first two seasons of the Second Doctor, another favorite (they just went through about two different producers and at least three script editors...). The Second Doctor is probably my favorite of all the incarnations, and the relationship he builds with Jamie and Victoria (once Ben and Polly go) is truly something special. This was the era which first introduced the Cybermen, the Yeti, the Ice Warriors, and saw two of the best Dalek stories in the entire show's history. I'm also a sucker for black and white cinematography, and I love the atmosphere it gives Sixties DW. The fact that most of this era is completely lost (thank god for the *Lost in Time* set, audio tapes, and telesnaps) is an unfair twist of bitter fate.

My biggest concern would be, how can you verify that the source of the future knowledge is accurate.  In the Angels Take Manhattan, the Doctor claims that because they read it in a book about them from the past that it was now a fixed point in time.  But how did they know that the book was completely accurate? Could the Doctor tell Amy that when she writes the book in the past to add certain parts in, thus negating the fixed-point as a work of fiction?

This lead me down a path of wondering if an enemy of the Doctor could force him to do certain things against his will by using this new found rule of ours.

Could someone feed the Doctor false knowledge of his own future, and thus force him to do those things for fear of creating a universe ending paradox?  How could the Doctor tell what is the real future, and what is an inaccurate future?

A friend of mine on FB posted the following:

&gt; A while back, Benedict Cumberbatch was asked if he'd appear in an episode of Doctor Who.
&gt; His response was ""Not AN episode, no"".
&gt; I will be very surprised if dude isn't the new Master.

My initial reply was along the lines of ""Yeah, it's been rumoured but nothing has been seriously announced"", to which he replied a want to see a John Simm cameo as a regeneration in to Benedicts version of The Master, and a regret that Derek Jacobi didn't get more screen time as The Master.

The following is my reply, and I figured I'd post it here to see who else agreed with me. I apologize in advance, it's a bit longer, took me a while to type and proof, and there's no funny pictures about how my SO got me something remotely DW related, so there's that out of the way.

I agree wholeheartedly on seeing Derek Jacobi being the Master for longer. He was a fresh spin on this older styling of The Master, like how Roger Delgado played, you got the sense this guy had made a life out of being just fucking evil and there wasn't a single bone of remorse, sympathy, kindness, or love in his body for anything other than sheer chaos. For the parts he was playing The Master, I expected a pontification scene like no fucking other, because it was the kind of Master Jacobi was playing and goddamnit it would have been glorious. Not so much with Simm.

The thing with Simm is that he obviously took the same spastic, cheeky approach to The Master that David took the same approach to The Doctor, hell, they were even prone to the same type of insane outbursts, but whereas The Doctors was ultimately rooted in benevolence and the want to help, The Master is the exact opposite, evil, dark, fucking horrible, but cheeky and funny as shit about it.

That's why I think John Simm's portrayal of The Master was so beautiful: he was the consummate yang to David Tennant's yin, exactly the same character but the exact moral opposite of Ten, and oh so subtle about it that it took me a good two years to figure this out to be the case.

Which brings me to The End of Time.

Both of these episodes weren't just about The Doctor regenerating into Eleven and us mourning Ten. The more background of it? They explained just WHY The Master is such a bastard. And it's not because of something trifle, it's not because he was BORN that way or because his parents never loved him, it's because of the Time Lord Council, it's because of Rassilon and being too goddamned proud and fucked up to not warp a child in to his own puppet. What we saw happen with the White-Point Star diamond was momentary, a fleeting gesture by a corrupt Lord President to further his mission. The deeper implication of that almost casual tossing of the diamond meant centuries of pain, problems, and heartache for everyone involved. Fucking predestination paradox'.

We saw why The Master was so fucked up, and in a way that didn't make up for his past atrocities...you kind of almost felt sorry for the guy. He never had a chance. I mean, okay, the implication was there, that some Time Lords looked at The Untempered Schism and went mad, but what I took from it was that The Master went mad because of the drumbeat, not the actual viewing of the Schism. And I just felt sorry for him, he got fucked royally and there wasn't a thing that could be done....

Until he shoved Ten out of the way and fought down his demons, his actual physical demons. He pushed the Council back in to the Time Lock and saved Earth, he became the centerpoint for The End of Time, the focus, the main character, putting The Doctor in the backseat without him having resolved anything other than shooting the generator, and we TOTALLY forgot that Wilf was in that glass box for just a second, and we thought we were gonna have Ten for a little while longer. When the Time Lock closed back around all of them, that was it for The Master.

We had his reasoning for everything he'd ever done, and while it didn't make it right we almost kind of understood all the problems and schemes, we saw him become one of the good guys, even if you want to say it was solely based on that moment and wasn't a complete turn of character for him. I'd like to think that if he had stayed he might've started on the path of redemption somehow before burning out entirely, but that's getting in to Fanfic territory pretty fast.

I love the character of The Master, but I don't know how I'd really feel having him back after that fucking brilliant send off. You could keep him evil, sure, but it'd sully the actions of The End of Time. You could turn him in to a sort of anti-hero, but that'd be cheap too. Knowing Grand High Moff, he'll pull something brilliant out of his ass, because I truly hope he does, my expectations are really, really high for it all.

**TL;DR: I don't know if having The Master come back right now is a good idea no matter who portrays them, but I won't cast my final judgement until I see it happen. I also read in to things WAY too much. And I capitalize the word way a lot randomly.**",,False,,t5_2tf29,False,,,True,t3_zsvva,http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/zsvva/on_the_master_reading_between_the_lines_xpost/,

Not sure if it's been thought about before, but;

As we all know Moffat has stated the finale will ""change the show forever."" A lot of us seem believe the Time Lords will be making a return via the Doctor's name being a key. Hell, there's even an entire thread on it: http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/1d9t0d/i_think_i_have_figured_out_what_will_change_the/

But anyways; my version of the same theory.

The show is suppose to change forever and returning the Time Lords to New Who could certainly do that. Now there's this:
&gt; If the only other people in the universe who know his name (the other Timelords) are all in the timelock then the Doctors name would be the safest word to use.

So all this has been said and ""done."" But why do I believe that this theory in particular holds a degree of validity? Clara's clothes.

People mentioned as early as the Bells of St. John that Clara always wore red. I wrote it off, thinking it was simply her favorite color. But she literally *always* wears red. I only took note of this in the latest episode. Then there's the red sonic setting which we've finally gotten to see. and The next episode is even named The *Crimson* Horror. Red. Red. Red. Red has been such a prevalent theme this half of the season. Isn't it plausible the color is a hint at the future?

We all know that the Doctor is no stranger to loss. His companions are left behind, leave him, or in the case of Adric, die. His people are locked away in the Time War, which is locked (And, hey, they're kind of a big back of dicks, so they sort of had it coming). Even the closest thing he has to a brother, in the Master, is little more than a constant cycle of loss and reunting, only to lose again. To travel with the Doctor, or even have him as any part of your life is to invite loss and pain into your life.

Though the Doctor lives up to his namesake. He strives to ease suffering, to mitigate pain. He exists to try to make things better, even if he is the cause of it. Looking at just NewWho, Rose, who is 'forever' locked away from the Doctor in a parallel world, ends up with the man she loves, and even avoids the Mayfly-December problem. The Doctor makes no qualms about destroying the lives of Martha and her family, but we see a better relationship among her family, and a much stronger (and happily married, to another of the Doctor's damaged castoffs, no less) by the time her story comes to a close. Donna (lovely, brash, lemon-juice-in-a-papercut Donna) seems closest to a tragic character, with the audience knowing that she was, for one shining moment, the most important person in all of creation, and she's not allowed to remember. This is soften immensely when you look at the fact that the woman that never felt that she was anything special finds a man that loves her for her, and not for the things she's done (universe saving does tend to make you popular with the blokes, after all), but for who she is. Being filthy rich does help, though. Even Amy and Rory, who were stuck in the past, had a happily ever after living with each other, without the danger of traveling with the Doctor.

The Doctor seems to be particularly talented at turning tragedy into happily ever after, or at least bittersweet.

To me, Clara represents a concept that the Doctor has a hard time grasping, or at least is having trouble remembering as of late. Remember how ecstatic Nine was at the end of ""The Doctor Dances"" when he was actually able to say ""Just this once, Rose. Everybody Lives!""? We have gotten away from the idea of a Doctor that understands that he can't fix everything. We saw at the end of Ten's run, the hubris of the Time Lord Victorious, and the folly of him believing he could fix everything. 

We see occasions where the Doctor does not save the day, or at least not everybody. We see his ego deflate when, after saving the crew of Bowie Base One, Capt. Adelaide Brooks decides to take her own life. We see the pain when Astrid sacrifices herself for him during ""Voyage of the Damned"". 

I'm a little fuzzy still on the how, but I think that Clara is there to try to teach the Doctor that when the stakes are as high as he plays them, he doesn't always win. Somebody (And I'm half-convinced it's River, given how she is appearing in the season finale) is trying to teach the Doctor that he needs to learn that he can't save everybody. He needs to come to terms with the fact that Doctors lose patients, no matter how hard they may try to save every one. 

We have met Clara before. Clara is every person he has failed to save. She is Adelaide. She is Astrid. She is Adric. Clara is everything that the Doctor cannot come to terms with, and is holding him back. She is his greatest weakness: His own compassion.

Or maybe I just need to get some sleep....

I feel like there were a few hints buried in TBOSJ in regards to the 3 Clara/Oswins.  Clara was fully uploaded to the Great Intelligence, and although the people at the ""Shard"" dumped all of the people back out of the system, maybe the GI kept a copy of Clara, knowing The Doctor and knowing his feelings towards Clara.  The GI, being part of a race as old and as wise as the Time Lords, is now using Clara as a trap or a device to get the Doctor to the fields of Trenzalore.  The Silence has been the overall arc since Moffat grabbed the helm, but maybe the Silence are working for the GI.  I don't think Clara is River, I'm not a big fan of that theory, nor do I think she is a regenerated Jenny.  I think the Clara that the Doctor is currently traveling with could be a ""ganger"" Clara, and that the real Clara is being held at Trenzalore.  I can foresee another Clara death in the upcoming season, which leads the Doctor to Trenzalore to rescue the real Clara.

That is one of many theories, I know.  My only problem with my own theory is ""run you clever boy, and remember..."", it's been said 3 times now and has to be something important.  So, I know this is a rough theory so far, but I haven't really read much else in this direction.  I think the Great Intelligence has a really big part in the Clara/Oswin mystery.
