Just point out some flaws so I can argue with my mom. Thanks.

Where is his Nobel prize. xD Oh wait, I forgot, Its a conspiracy.

I thought /r/evolution would be more appropriate than /r/atheism

I don't know, maybe...

UPDATE:

For anyone wondering how the argument with my mom went. I showed her this thread and allowed her to read the comments.

She admitted the way Kirk presented his argument trying to use the ""facts"" of evolution was kind of ridiculous. I even got her to say that he is probably a little biased. She said the bee thing didn't line up with what evolutionists believe.

She still thinks evolution is a lie of the devil. I can't change that. 

I am very familiar with /r/atheism, The Atheist Experience, and other things alike. So I know the logical arguments, I like to talk about Noah's ark with her when she brings up evolution.

There is no changing her mind, and I rarely bring it up unless she sends me something like this.

...but she is 55 and works 2 jobs all day long, most days of the week.
She needs some fuckin' hope. She worries for my soul. =[

However, this thread has been informative to me and has encouraged me to do more research on evolution on my own because I find it very interesting or cool.

3. Circular Reasoning.  This was a big one.  Basically I was taught that an evolutionist says ""This rock is 5 million years old."" (How do you know that?)

1. How can life come from no life? or non living non replicating material begin to replicate itself? (Can science study this process or elements of this process or is this a matter of philosophy

2. Why would life evolve reproduction or the drive to propagate its species? What is the purpose in that specific evolution?

Thank you for contacting me about H. Res. 81, legislation expressing support for the designation of February 12th as Darwin Day. I welcome your thoughts on this legislation.

 

As you know, the monumental work and ideas of Charles Darwin laid the foundation for humankind's modern understanding of our own origins. We stand on the shoulders of those who come before us, and the ingenuity exemplified by Darwin has promoted scientific discoveries that have solved countless problems and improved living conditions across the globe. I'm very proud to represent Silicon Valley, where much of our nation's cutting-edge innovation, advanced research, and technological revolution occur. 

 

H. Res. 81 would formally recognize Darwin's contributions to modern science, and would formally express Congress' support for the designation of February 12th—Darwin's birthday—as  
""Darwin Day."" This legislation has been referred to the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee where it is currently awaiting further action. Should it come before me in the House, I will certainly vote for it.

Most gratefully,

For this week's discussion, the topic is sex and sexuality and why (or how) these two evolved. Additionally, this may also be a good time to discuss sexual selection.

It should go without saying that sex is one of the most important evolutionary events in earth's history, [and has been shown to be extremely beneficial compared to asexual reproduction](http://www.biology.uiowa.edu/neiman/pdf/Neiman%20et%20al.%202010.pdf). However, despite the advantages [many eukaryotes have made a switch to a pseudo-asexual or fully asexual lifestyle](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2001/07/0702_wirefemalemites.html). How could these evolutionary switches have occurred?

The evolution of sexuality is open to much more speculation than the mechanistic sexual acts that it originates from. This is especially true in ourselves; we are a species with a wide range of sexualities and sexual tastes. Heterosexuality may be the ""norm"", but there is still homosexuality, asexuality, bisexuality, as well as fringe practices that we often find repulsive (and usually make illegal): pedophilia, bestiality, necrophilia, etc. Additionally, though the typical Western society praises monogamy as the ideal we still have adultery, polygamy, polygyny, polyandry, and polyamourous relationships. How could this impressive range of tastes, fetishes, or desires have evolved? What purpose could it possibly serve?

The last major aspect you may want to consider is the evolution of the orgasm. Chimps, Dolphins, and Humans are famous for feeling physical pleasure during sex, and seeking sexual release without actual reproduction. The drive to have sex is clearly strong enough to keep most sexual species reproducing, so why have a select few evolved to feel pleasure? Is it simply a reward system?

It may also be interesting to consider the [the evolution of the female orgasm](http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=6GFNvA6TvlwC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=female+orgasm+lloyd&amp;ots=OSNLqENr-n&amp;sig=E4MGmMcLyv3U_-awoZJZl5529AA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false) [(Book review here)](http://hiram-caton.com/documents/review%20Lloyd%20orgasm%20twin%20research.pdf). In short, male reproduction and sexuality are very closely linked but female reproduction seems to be dissociated. Men cannot orgasm without ejaculation, and afterwards feel an intense need to rest; however, women do not ovulate or become more fertile with an orgasm and do not feel as intense of a need for a rest after an orgasm. This leads to the question of whether female orgasm is a byproduct of male orgasm (tied to development of the fetus), or whether they are two separate developmental processes.

**I linked to Elizabeth Lloyd's book on female orgasm (worth the read), but I know that she has a much shorter summary article somewhere. If you can find it, please pm me the link and I will add it**

I've put forward several questions that I find interesting (or that I think could lead to an interesting discussion), but please don't feel the need to answer or even address any of these specifically.

Please feel free to speculate as much or as little as you want; we wish to encourage the discussion of peoples' ideas and opinions, not punish them for it. If you find someone's ideas lacking scientific support or sense do not downvote them, instead try finding counter-evidence and state your opinion in opposition to win them over to your side.

I was going to post  in /r/science but it felt too far removed from a true scientific discussion.

Anyway, I had a realization today--this may be partly philosophical or ethical, however I'm looking for any kind of response to this, whether it is scientific or social.

Humans do not seem to really follow a natural selection--what I mean by this is: within our society, we go out of our way to protect the weak and we define ourselves as ""human"" based on this compassion for being heroic. We view those who bypass or dismiss helpless individuals as ""cruel"" and ""inhumane"". We're brought up from a young age being taught chivalry and heroism through fairy tales and how to be a ""good person"" by helping those in need, but doesn't this completely contradict the natural order? This means the weak genes will stick around in the pool (of all humans) forever without ever being weeded out by natural selection because the weak are constantly being pulled up by the strong. 

In other words, *stupid people will always exist*. How can we expect to evolve as a species if we consider our humanity a defining characteristic that, if lost, would make us no more than ""savages"". I see many fictional plots such as The Walking Dead that shine a light on this ethical subject of ""keeping our humanity"" vs. ""fighting to survive"". If we embrace this mentality it would seem that we, as the collective human race, are facing inevitable doom without the ability to evolve in such a way that would ensure our survival long term.

EDIT: Sorry again, I'm new to the sub so pardon some of my ignorance surrounding some of the fundamental knowledge of evolution and biology, I'm still learning.

For our first discussion, we're going for a widely debated and multifaceted  discussion topic -- the levels of selection.

The ""levels"" are often described as being at the level of the gene, cell, individual, group, or a multi-level combination of these. Consider the implications and consequences of selection at one level for another level when thinking about where selection acts upon.

Here are some things to consider (some more leading than others):

* At which ""level"" does selection act?

* Has selection always acted on the same level?

* Was the evolution of altruism a consequence of selection at a specific level?

* What does it mean to be a ""unit of selection""?

* What does the future hold for the selection (Note: These will be very speculative)

* What level of selection affects humans the most?


Please feel free to speculate as much or as little as you want; we wish to encourage the discussion of peoples' ideas and opinions, not punish them for it.

1363832515.0,34,self.evolution,1aph4b,Released a book today about evolution and Christianity,47,13,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/evolution/comments/1aph4b/released_a_book_today_about_evolution_and/,"Well, today my tiny little publishing company released a book that my co-author and I have been working on for quite a while now: *Evolving out of Eden: Christian Responses to Evolution*. It's about the dilemma that the reality of evolution poses for the dogma of ancient beliefs.

There have been a lot of books about evolution, and plenty of them that cover the faith-science conflict. But it seemed to us that most authors had an axe to grind one way or another. From the theistic evolution side, there is a lot of trying to patch up the holes in theology, put on a smile, and say all is well. And from the opposite extreme it seems that there has been a certain glee in demolishing the claims of religion.

Our book ""began as a collaboration between an atheist, Robert M. Price, and a believing but troubled Christian, Edwin A. Suominen [me] who was wrestling with what he perceived as a grave conflict between evolution and his inherited faith. Having both accepted the reality of evolution . . . , we agreed to research its theological implications and the various ways that Christian writers have tried to smooth things over"" (p. 13). I'm no longer a Christian, in part due to the evolution issue. But when the book project began, I still was one, seeking some resolution of what I saw as a potential death-knell for my childhood faith. And my conclusion now is that it was just that. It is for good reason that fundamentalist Christianity denies and fears evolution: ""Here there be tygers,"" as the old maps used to read on their margins.

The issues aren't just the design argument and Original Sin, though those are major ones. There is the question of Jesus' own nature as an evolved primate (well, half of one anyhow), the credibility of the Bible after being so wrong about the origins issue, and the whole idea of ""sin"" given that our human nature is evolved (biologically and culturally) from ancestors who were doing what it took to survive and reproduce.

If this isn't the right subreddit for this, I trust you'll let me know. I just thought it might be a bit more on target than /r/atheism. Ours isn't really a religion-bashing book, just one that examines theology in light of evolution (co-authored by an atheist theologian and Bible scholar) and concludes that there seems to be little basis for thinking the two can be reconciled. We hope it will be read by believers and nonbelievers alike, though realistically, the fear &amp; loathing factor will probably keep many of the faithful away.

1361745860.0,32,self.evolution,195max,"My main complaint with ""evolution simulators""",36,4,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/evolution/comments/195max/my_main_complaint_with_evolution_simulators/,"I've noticed that this occurs in many evolution simulations I have seen. I can really divide them into three classes:

* CLASS I - Simulations of artificial selection or anything where there is one ultimate desired morphology/behaviour to be reached. Examples include the ""biomorphs"" in Dawkins' *Greatest Show on Earth*.
* CLASS II - Even though there is no one ultimate goal, artificial constraints like a fixed generation size and/or a ""fitness function"" exist. Examples include [BoxCar2D](http://www.boxcar2d.com) and the clock simulation in CDK007's video.
* CLASS III - The most realistic of them all. All you need to do to pass on your genes is survive and reproduce. Examples include [Darwin Pond](http://www.ventrella.com/darwin/darwin.html), its descendent [Swimbots](http://www.swimbots.com), and [Species Game](http://www.speciesgame.com).

Despite this, I've noticed a problem that exists even in Class-III evolution simulations. As it was pointed out by Ventrella (1996), the pattern is ""initial population → die-off → survivors replenish the earth"". I've noticed in all the Class-III simulations I've mentioned that although it's initially a simulation of evolution by natural selection, once some dominant race emerges, it becomes more a simulation of the work of Thomas Malthus than anything else (especially in Darwin Pond, where I've seen many times food rise linearly and population rise exponentially, only to crash). The reason for this? I think it's because the environment never changes. Darwin Pond and Swimbots just have a big square pool with dots spontaneously forming all the time; Species Game just has jungle and inhospitable desert. In the real world, environments continually change. As Gould pointed out, an unchanging environment will mean little evolution. Does anybody know of an evolution simulation that has a dynamic, changing environment?

[TL;DR version: Even the best evolution simulations never have a changing environment and so very little real evolution after the initial die-off. Are there any evolution simulations where the environment changes over time?]",,False,,t5_2qhs7,False,,,True,t3_195max,http://www.reddit.com/r/evolution/comments/195max/my_main_complaint_with_evolution_simulators/,

On an evolutionary scale, with human intervention via selective breeding for intelligence, is 5,000 or 10,000 years enough time to get something drastically different than the dogs we have today?  



Granted on a technology scale humans will probably be doing some pretty interesting things 5000 years from now if we don't kill ourselves first.  I suppose genetic manipulation to create a braniac dog isn't out of the question on that time scale either (maybe the wrong subreddit for that conversation)

Edit - Just to draw a line in the sand for arguments sake. Do you think dogs will be able to read in 5,000 years.

1369592411.0,28,self.evolution,1f3bi5,"Someone had an interesting question about RNA self-replication, but then deleted it",33,5,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/evolution/comments/1f3bi5/someone_had_an_interesting_question_about_rna/,"I thought it could've sparked a great conversation, because it's a really interesting topic.  Basically they linked an article demonstrating an RNA-only, two-step system capable of replication, and their question was whether RNA could replicate itself, what connection to abiogenesis it might have, and whether RNA was only capable of replicating 10-15% of its length, which was their impression.

I wrote a long response and I'd like to share it, because the RNA world hypothesis and how it developed is a really interesting part of abiogenesis (a topic I think everyone interested in evolution should also explore), and because I wish the poster had gotten a detailed answer.  

So here it is:

&gt;I tried writing a bit of scientific history but I think it may be filled with too many unfamiliar concepts if you have no organic chemistry background.

&gt;The short version is: yes, SYSTEMS (not individual strands) of multiple RNA molecules exist which can copy themselves completely (given a supply of ""raw material"" input in the form of the 4 precursor bases for RNA: [adenine, guanine, cytosine, uracil](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide)) in a two-step process as your article says.  

&gt;--------------
Here's the long version:

&gt;The reason why there may be some confusion about whether RNA can self-replicate and what its purpose is might be because RNA's self-replication wasn't discovered first.  The ability of RNA to self-replicate as a system of molecules (as in your article and hsfrey's comment) is only a more recent discovery.  

&gt;In the beginning of our understanding of genetic material, we only thought of RNA as an intermediary ""information-carrying"" molecule, because we discovered that it acted as an intermediary between DNA and proteins when DNA created proteins in a multiple-step process.  

&gt;In the scientific vocabulary, DNA is [transcribed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics\) ) into RNA (a ""mirrored"" RNA strand is created using a DNA strand as a ""template""), and then RNA is [translated](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_(biology\) ) into proteins (a sort of ""mirrored"" protein strand is created using the RNA strand as a ""template"").  These proteins then served functions in the cell.  

&gt;------------

&gt;We weren't aware RNA was ALSO capable of acting like a enzyme, which are usually a part of any biological process.

&gt;(Enzymes are highly selective biological catalysts.  Catalysts are molecules that make a chemical reaction easier to happen or let a chemical reaction happen more often. In more technical vocabulary, we say enzymes act as a [catalyst](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalyst#Biology) when they lower the [activation energy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activation_energy) of the reaction).  

&gt;---------

&gt;So.  We discovered in 1981 that some RNA strands would spontaneously fold into functional enzymes molecules.  We called them [ribozymes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribozymes).  Ribozymes, like enzymes, catalyze (make easier to happen/let happen more often/lower the activation energy of) a specific reaction. 

&gt;From this, scientist began wondering about RNA's relationship to the beginning of life.  They knew that RNA was a potentially simpler molecule than DNA.  If it (when specific sequences of RNA folded into a ribozyme) could catalyze its own replication, it might have been the first genetic material.  We labeled this the [RNA world hypothesis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_world) &lt;-really interesting idea!

&gt;------
&gt;Since then, different experiments have uncovered various RNA-only systems of molecules capable of replication to varying degrees.  At first, simple systems that were discovered usually had very low fidelity (the accuracy of replication) or were capable of replicating only shorter lengths of RNA.  For example, [this experiment](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/292/5520/1319.abstract)
found a system with fidelity of only 98.9%.

&gt;(98.9% is very low compared to what we were used to seeing in sophisticated [DNA replication](http://www.pearsonhighered.com/mathews/ch24/c24fdr.htm) in modern cells.  ""DNA replication is, by far, the most accurate of known enzyme-catalyzed processes. The error rate per base pair per round of replication is about 10^-9 to 10^-10 "" i.e. a fidelity of 99.999999999%.  This may be where you got the impression that RNA was only capable of replicating 10-50% of itself- the first RNA-only systems of replication we investigated didn't always work so well in terms of replication fidelity or length of RNA they could replicate. Some only were capable of replicating the first, as in your example, 10-50% of their length, and so were only capable of 1 or 2 generations of replication.)

&gt;I don't know the specifics (fidelity percent, base pair length) of your example article, because I don't have access to it, BUT more recently through further experimentation we HAVE hit upon systems of RNA molecules capable of replicating themselves with higher fidelity, and sustaining systems (given raw material inputs) which both include longer pieces of RNA and are capable of replicating those longer lengths of RNA in their entirety.",,False,,t5_2qhs7,1369777828.0,,,True,t3_1f3bi5,http://www.reddit.com/r/evolution/comments/1f3bi5/someone_had_an_interesting_question_about_rna/,

1331650217.0,26,self.evolution,qukvh,So I went to a Christian conference....,35,9,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/evolution/comments/qukvh/so_i_went_to_a_christian_conference/,"My original post in r/debateanatheist, it was suggested I bring it to ya'll. 
A couple of weeks ago I went to a Christian conference because they were having a seminar on evolution. Having a curious and uneducated mind I wanted to compare what they say to what I find on Reddit. As I said, I am very uneducated when it comes to evolution so I thought perhaps my friends on Reddit could help me.

The presenter’s aim was to compare both evolution and intelligent design to form predictions based off what the two theories state. He would then take these predictions and compare them to the evidence we find. If you could help me out with responses to these statements I would greatly appreciate it. My friends are taking me to the creation museum in a month and I would enjoy having challenging questions to ask based off the information below. Also don’t feel like you have to answer all 4 questions, if you feel you have a strong argument for only one then please state that and let the others be. I appreciate your help.

1.Are the building blocks of life simple or complex?
a. Evolution predicts the basic building blocks of life: amino acids, DNA, RNA, proteins, etc. would be a simple process that gets more complex as life evolves.

b. Intelligent design predictions of the complexity or simplicity of the building blocks of life can go either way.

c. The evidence given: based on what we observe in the natural world the evidence leans toward life beginning with complexity and not evolving into complexity- They showed this video ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdBJt6sdDfI&amp;feature=relmfu) to demonstrate the complexity.

i. Additional claims made during the discussion: How were the cells able to reproduce without this complexity?

1.Do animal &amp; plant phyla (body types) appear in the beginning or at the end of the timeline? 
a. Evolution predicts animal and plant phyla will gradually transition or develop into a different species through small changes. Therefore the phyla (body types) will appear gradually over time.

b. Intelligent design predicts that the a variety of phyla will appear at the same time.

c. The evidence presented was when we look into the fossil record, during the Cambrian period, there appears to be a sudden appearance of dozens of major complex animal types with no trace of gradual steps.

1.Do we see evidence of life forms appearing to change over time?
a. Evolution predicts that we will see transitional changing over time. Darwin predicted innumerable transitions would be found in the fossil record.

b. Intelligent Design predicts that we will not see transitional changing over time.

c. To this date no transitional evidence has been found.

1.Would biological forms come with assembly instructions?
a. Evolution predicts the amino acids would arise and organize themselves without DNA.

b. Intelligent design predicts the DNA process would be started by a creator.

c. The evidence suggests amino acids need DNA to produce proteins. Amino acids have been unable to organize themselves into proteins on their own into a meaningful sequence. The chances of amino acids sequencing themselves into a meaningful code are astronomical in a single celled organism. Better explained in this video (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb6xdaC9hrM&amp;feature=relmfu) 

Edit note: I changed the building blocks of life question because it did not accurately communicate what the presenter was demonstrating, as evidenced by the video.

""Ignorance is simply not knowing facts and the ""theory"" of evolution is just that! No fact. Assuming what happened at the dawn of creation and filling in large gaps with guesses. I respectfully disagree and suggest you read the Bible for what it says happened ""in the beginning"". Order never comes from disorder and evolution never adds DNA information like the theory suggests! Info will always be lost never added. Adaption takes place all the time but no species changes from one to the next...from monkey to Neanderthal to modern man. There's plenty of scientific ""facts"" supporting both sides it all comes down to what religious belief you choose to have faith in evolution religion or creation religion.""

However, I've read most of his popular published books and he seems to convey a sound, understandable argument when discussion evolution, natural selection etc.

I am not looking for a debate. I am looking to learn. 

To give a little background, I was born and raised a bible thumping Christian. I was very active in the church, even giving a bible based talk on Evolution vs. Creation. 

I have since questioned everything I was ever taught. I take that back, I always questioned what I was learning and there were many things that just did not make sense to me. After listening to a friend discuss Evolution, I determined it would be perfectly logical if God created the Earth and everything on it, and then let Evolution take over from there as I did not believe the timeline for the Earth and man's creation (6,000-7,000 years). 

Since I stopped going to church six years ago, I have become more open to the idea of Evolution and can more clearly see evidence of Evolution around us. (I was HEAVILY indoctrinated). I still have not started reading more about Evolution...probably mostly from fear, but also just from a lack of time. 

I do have two nagging questions though. 

1. Why are our brains MORE developed than what we need? From my previous research, I learned we use less than one percent of our total brain's capacity. If we have evolved, why would our brains develop PAST the capacity for what we need? Wouldn't it be more logical that we use 90-99% of our brain's capacity, with some having more ability than others? 

2. Why do flowers have colors? In my bible-based sermon, I demonstrated how flowers have an ultra-violet pattern on them. [Example](http://www.educatedearth.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/flowerview.jpg) I then reasoned that flowers did not need color to continue to be pollinated since the insects would see the flowers using ultraviolet as opposed to the colors we see. If that is the case, why do the flowers need any color? For the flowers to survive, wouldn't they only need the ultraviolet patterns? Was my research on this faulty? 

I appreciate your time. I am willing to overcome my fears and learn, but those two questions have really been bugging me lately. ",,False,,t5_2qhs7,False,,,True,t3_ve2qq,http://www.reddit.com/r/evolution/comments/ve2qq/two_sincere_questions/,

Why do we believe that life only originated once? The typical response is the ubiquitous DNA code, but I'd like to know more about that. If the structure of DNA is the only way for a self-replicating, information-carrying large molecule to form, then the fact that all life has DNA doesn't prove anything. Because of RNA, we know that there are at least ways for there to be slight variances, but again, this doesn't seem to confirm or deny a single origin. 

How much of the structure of DNA is arbitrary, and how much is vital for it to function as it does? Are the base pairs the only vital parts of DNA for its function? Is the phosphate at all necessary in anything like its current form? The ribose/deoxyribose? Is there any other way that some base-pair equivalent could work about as well?

What about proteins? I've learned that all life forms seem to use about twenty out of a pool of twenty-two or so amino acids, but that isn't the exhaustive list of all possible amino acids. Does this point to a single origin or is there a chemical reason for which these ~20 are are the only ones used?

It is with great respect that I write to urge you to mark this special day, the 12th of February, 2012, to cosponsor H.Res.81.IH- designating February 12th Darwin Day in honor of the esteemed founder of modern biology the precursor to our study of genetics.

Regardless of how passionately you may feel about the need to designate a day after Darwin, there is a compelling reason to honor his work in forming the backbone of the 14th district as it is known- Silicon Valley. Without the work done on evolution by natural selection, there is no biotech, no advanced medical research, and with it much of the technology and computers that have been developed to study such things. My own father came to Silicon Valley after studying biophysics- making computer models of how creatures behaved and evolved, eventually working for tech companies.

Rep. Stark, your colleague in the California Democratic caucus, is correct- Darwin should be honored in some way by the House for his contributions to our understanding of life, and the practical contributions to what makes our economy vibrant and stronger every year. Let us wish him a happy birthday.

With warmest regards,

Kazmarov

For this week's discussion, we're going for another widely debated and multifaceted discussion topic -- the species concept and other classifications of organisms.

Historically, species were easy to define and obvious for most people; dogs were one species, cows were one species, and humans were one species with little ambiguity. However, with the emergence of modern scientific techniques at the genetic, morphologic, and ecological level this once cut-and-dry concept has been destroyed. Now we are left with the question, what exactly is a species?
I will very briefly outline four of the ""big"" species concepts, though [there are many more than this](http://scienceblogs.com/evolvingthoughts/2006/10/01/a-list-of-26-species-concepts/)

* **Biological species concept:** A group of organisms is only a species if it can breed and produce fertile offspring with another organism.

* **Typological species concept:** A group of organisms are members of a species only if they have a certain set of fixed phenotypes (often morphological phenotypes). This is the historical species concept; if it looks like animal X, then it IS species X.

* **Phylogenetic species concept:** A group that has a common anscestor and maintains integrity within its lineage and then makes an obvious split from another group can be counted as a new species. The parent species MUST have gone taxonomically extinct for this concept to be used.

* **Evolutionary species concept:** The same as the above, but the parent species does not have to go extinct taxonomically

There should be obvious advantages and disadvantages to each of these concepts (and all others not listed), as well as interesting implications for using one over another. 

Something else to think about are the consequences of using higher and lower levels of classification. Why do we use Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species, Subspecies? Using this form would appear to confuse what we normally think of as easy distinctions; for example, this makes all birds cladistically dinosaurs. Is this a problem? And much like the species problem, how do we tell when something is a species or a subspecies?

Here are some things to consider (some more leading than others):

* Do hybrids pose problems for any of these concepts?

* How do we determine species in single-celled, possibly asexual organisms?

* Do any of these pose problems for current ecological protection laws?

* Who really cares? Does this have any effect on science? Why do we need these classifications?

* Are higher level classifications--Kingdoms, Phyla, Orders, etc.-- any more or less ""real"" than species?

By evolving to have a great amount of intelligence (including our verbal and especially written communication skills), humans have become masters of the planet. Sure, dinosaurs may have been around for a much longer time than we have so far, but no other creature has been able to manipulate the environment to suit them the way we have.


For example, we no longer need to adapt to changes in climate since we just modify our clothing/housing to fit the location. We can live in extremely resource scarce places simply by creating farms or by importing food, rich in all the vitamins and minerals we need. If a disease starts killing us, we simply create a cure. There isn't a predator on Earth that humans couldn't kill with the right tools.


I realize we are still subconsciously guided by our evolutionary history - by our instinctual desire to reproduce, for example, and the traits we desire in mates. And yet we still have people of all shapes, sizes, colors, and personalities reproducing and carrying their genes forward, regardless of their 'fitness' (Not trying to promote eugenics here, I'm just making an observation). We have created societal safety nets that mean we largely don't fall prey to survival of the fittest, a good thing in my opinion, but contradictory to every other organism on Earth.

For most creatures, geographical barriers can easily lead to speciation, but humans see a lot of crossover, especially with the advent of modern travel technology. Aside from a few tribes, no one is truly cut off from the rest of humanity.

So...have we transcended evolution? Or are we simply evolving in different ways?",,False,,t5_2qhs7,False,,,True,t3_13gczs,http://www.reddit.com/r/evolution/comments/13gczs/are_humans_still_evolving/,

For this week's discussion, the topic is on evolution of ageing.

Though from the outside ageing seems like a simple process, causing organisms to degenerate due to ""wear and tear"", the process itself seems to be more complicated than this. Organisms age in different fashions, degrees, and at different times so the question becomes simply why? There are mechanistic theories that are reminiscent of the ""wear and tear"" idea, basically that starting at the level of DNA the body eventually cannot keep up with the constant damage and eventually succumbs to it. However, with recent advances in molecular genetics it has been discovered that many organisms have ""ageing genes"" that have no other apparent purpose other than to cause the classic symptoms of ageing. This would suggest that ageing is a process that was evolved like all other biological processes and cycles.

[A fairly representative list of historical and modern theories of ageing can be found here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_ageing)

Here are some things to consider (some more leading and speculative than others):

* Why do some organisms age while others don't?

* Why are some organisms subject to indeterminate growth, while others are not?

* Is DNA damage the ultimate cause of ageing? Are there other causes that may contribute more to the classical signs of age?

* Can humans ever beat ageing? Can humans beat death?

&gt; An interesting *hypothetical* outcome based on release of selection by C-section would be a rise in IQ in the population delivered by C-section and in the total population. This advance in intelligence would retrace on a smaller quantitative scale and shorter time scale the dramatic increase in brain size and presumably IQ in the hominid lineage. This hypothesis would be based on the following: Selection has been acting against big brained newborns; these newborns are more likely to have had a C-section birth; and there is a correlation between newborn brain volume and later IQ. Wilcox’s data from the weight specific newborn mortality curve demonstrates selection against newborns with birth weights heavier than 3,600 grams (Wilcox &amp; Russell, 1983). An algorithm from the University of Florida is available to predict the risk of C-section in nulliparous patients based on six variables, one of which is newborn birth weight (Geng &amp; Uryasev, 2006). In their analysis of 3,355 patients, the risk of C-section for cephalopelvic disproportion increased with newborn weight. **Newborn brain size does correspond to birth weight, and in normal birth weight newborns there is a correlation between birth weight and IQ at age seven (Matte et al., 2001). The three intermediary supports for the hypothesis are in place, and an increase in IQ in the C-sectioned cohort is a testable hypothesis.**

between in vivo brain volume and intelligence](http://www.pdf-archive.com/2011/10/25/mcdaniel-big-brain/mcdaniel-big-brain.pdf) (2005)

&gt; The relationship between brain volume and intelligence has been a topic of a scientific debate since at least the
1830s. To address the debate, a meta-analysis of the relationship between in vivo brain volume and intelligence
was conducted. Based on 37 samples across 1530 people, the population correlation was estimated at 0.33. The
correlation is higher for females than males. It is also higher for adults than children. **For all age and sex groups, it
is clear that brain volume is positively correlated with intelligence.**

* [Rare Copy Number Deletions Predict Individual Variation in Intelligence](http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0016339) (2011)

&gt; The measure of CNV deletions we used aggregates many different deletions. The genetic effect demonstrated here is different in kind than that revealed by studies of individual SNPs or large aggregations of SNPs (e.g., [20]). The rare or infrequent deletions we tabulated were scattered across the genome, and by definition occur at a given locus in less than 5% of our sample (that is, 9 of 196 individuals). But in fact, most had fewer. In that sample, we detected 3363 distinct rare or infrequent CNVs (that is, ones at different sites). Of those, nearly 80% were detected in fewer than ~1% (1 or 2). A mere 3% were detected in more than 3% of individuals (7–9). The mean, median, and mode of the percentage detected were ~1%, 5%, and 5%, respectively. And these values include insertions; deletions tended to represented in rarer CNVs than insertions (see also [35]).

&gt; These facts have two important implications. First, different people have different deletions. Indeed, given the distribution of infrequent deletions, it stands to reason that the large majority of random pairs of individuals share none of these deletions. And for any two individuals possessing even a handful of them, the probably that they share precisely the same ones is vanishingly small.

&gt; Second and relatedly, it must then be the case that many different individual CNVs have common effects on intellectual functioning, with no one CNV deletion possessing any more than a very small effect. (Indeed, though total CNV deletions predict FSIQ much better than any SNP does, any particular deletion may do no better than any individual SNP). Our sample is of insufficient size to examine the effects of many individual CNV deletions. But with 3364 individual rare variations possible, it seems unlikely that only a small subset carries the effect we observe. The reason is simple: Each CNV deletion can possibly account for only a tiny amount of total variation in the aggregate measure of infrequent deletions. Were it the case that only a small subset (say &lt;10%—still, well over 100) had reliable associations, their variation accounted for would be overwhelmed by the variation in the remaining non-relating deletions (say &gt;90%), leaving a very small amount of variation accounted for. **Hence, the only plausible view is that a sizeable number of infrequent deletions covary with IQ.**

...

&gt; As emphasized in the introduction, a primary impetus for examining associations between rare CNV deletions and intellectual functioning is the theoretical perspective that argues that genetic variation in psychometric intelligence is largely due to the existence of individually rare but, at a genome-wide level, ubiquitous deleterious variants—mutations that are selected against—rather than the existence of recently arisen, positively selected variants [23]. Our results are consistent with this proposal. Although CNV deletions may constitute a major form of deleterious variants, this theoretical perspective also expects that some mutations at the single nucleoside level affect intelligence as well. **Our findings are also consistent with Miller's theory [68] that mate selection based on intelligence may provide a mechanism to optimize “good genes” in offspring (but see also [69]).**

* [Diversity of Human Copy Number Variation and Multicopy Genes](https://www.sciencemag.org/content/330/6004/641.short) (2010)

&gt; Copy number variants affect both disease and normal phenotypic variation, but those lying within heavily duplicated, highly identical sequence have been difficult to assay. By analyzing short-read mapping depth for 159 human genomes, we demonstrated accurate estimation of absolute copy number for duplications as small as 1.9 kilobase pairs, ranging from 0 to 48 copies. We identified 4.1 million “singly unique nucleotide” positions informative in distinguishing specific copies and used them to genotype the copy and content of specific paralogs within highly duplicated gene families. **These data identify human-specific expansions in genes associated with brain development, reveal extensive population genetic diversity, and detect signatures consistent with gene conversion in the human species.** Our approach makes ~1000 genes accessible to genetic studies of disease association.

Why do you read r/evolution? I've thought of a few possible common answers below, but please add a different reason if you have one!

* Is it for popular science news regarding evolution-related discoveries? 

* Links to relevant scholarly/journal articles about evolution? 

* Discussion of the details of evolutionary theory (ie. selection models)? 

* Debate regarding evolution vs. intelligent design?

* Discussion of religion as it relates to evolution?

* Answers to your questions about evolution?

I'm genuinely curious! 

I study evolution, and so I'd say my main motivations for subscribing lie with the second and third points (journal articles, and discussion of theory). I've noticed a lot of religion/ID-related posts lately (not an overwhelming amount, but more), and while they bother me, I've not downvoted them because I recognize we all have different reasons for being there. I'm just curious what others think!

***

Edited to add: thanks for the responses, I love reading everyone's replies! It seems that there's a bit of consensus around points 1, 2, 3, and 6, which is as I predicted. I may make another self-post if this gets buried in the comments related to the following points...

&gt; I am angered to see the ignorance of those fighting to have creationism tossed into science class as a viable alternative to evolution, but this is not the place. 

I tend to agree with this sentiment.

It sounds like the majority of the readers of this subreddit come here for the science, not the ""controversy.""

A few of the top links/titles/articles of late:

* ""This is the most bunk piece of literature I have ever read, and it hurts my brain to think people can read this and claim it as fact.""

* ""Rosa Rubicondior: Where Creationists Get Confused.""

* ""Do Catholics believe in evolution?""

* ""Bill Nye, Creationism is Highly Appropriate for our Children - YouTube - [3:24]""

* Kentucky Republicans realize that they screwed up: students will have to learn evolution!

These all relate to religion/ID/politics first, and science second (if they even relate to the actual study of evolution at all). Of course, not ALL or even most topics are this bad, and we have had some great links/articles posted. However, this growing minority of unscientific posts is cause for concern, primarily because it legitimizes the notion of the ""controversy"" of evolution.

Is it a sort of defense mechanism to discourage us from eating their food store? Also, I know this is a pretty loose and weird question, but any insight would be appreciated.

Pineapples are fruit, so aren't they meant to be a seed distribution mechanism? Why, then, are they so difficult to get into? They have huge spiky leaves on top and a tough, spiky exterior.

An evolutionary process created that sharp sense for us to use. This probably progressed from an array of light sensitive cells. But the thinking here is that you trace it back far enough there needs to be a place where you get a trait from nowhere. Or is that not the case?

If they were true, he says, then those people wouldn't exist, or we would kill them off, because survival of the fittest is one of the main components of natural selection and evolution.

1374711247.0,16,self.evolution,1izs90,Please help me answer a couple of questions regarding evolution that a friend has brought up. He is writing a book.,20,4,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/evolution/comments/1izs90/please_help_me_answer_a_couple_of_questions/,"One of my friends has derived his own ideas regarding the origins of man. He's attempting to write a book on the subject. While I applaud his drive I have a lot of issues with how he is representing evolution in the book so far. I’ve got most of it covered but there are couple items I could use some help with. Could you provide me some info as to why these topics are incorrect? 

1) He contends that Homo erectus, Homo heidelbergensis, Homo neanderthal, Homo floresiensis, Homo denisovian and Homo antecessor are actually the same species that have just gone through micro-evolution or morphology. He likens it to a Clydesdale being slightly different than a pony. I know this is inaccurate but I’m having trouble articulating why very well.

2) He asks why species such the platypus and echidna have fossils dating back to millions years that are unchanged. He contends if evolutionists were right there would be some evolved creatures in the bottle-necked environment that would resemble these two in some way. He states science does not know where to place these two in species category so they call them extant. He defines extent as supposed to be extinct. I have never heard of this premise or of extent meaning supposed to be extinct. I am ignorant on this topic but would it be suffice to say that these are in fact mammals (albeit with some primitive features) and have not evolved because their environment has not required them to do so?

Thank you. Any input is much appreciated.  

Edit: Grammar

Edit 2: Just wanted to say thank you r/evolution. You provided me with the information I needed and more. This is a great subreddit.

1) It does not take into account reciprocity - I might die for some unrelated brothers-in-arms or children, because others would do the same for me. 

2) Don't we all share most of the same DNA with everyone? Aren't the genetic differences between us mostly trivial when compared to what are share? In fact, wouldn't it be true that looked at completely from the genes perspective, saving a gorilla would in fact be ""saving"" a lot of my own genes?

3) It doesn't take into account that other people are part of your environment and social group - saving another individual might be very important for the social group as a whole.

However this new species of hybrid black tip sharks was discovered in Feb of 2012 of the coast of Australia. It's from a result of a common black tip and an Australian black tip sharks that normally never come in contact with each other but because of climate changes and rising water temps, it seems these two species found each other and mated to created this hybrid black tip shark. 

So my question is, is this a result of artificial selection or natural selection? I'm assuming it's natural selection since it was a cross-breeding result out of pure happen-chance that these two types of black tip species mated.

For this week's discussion the topic is noncoding or ""junk"" DNA. According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noncoding_DNA), noncoding DNA is ""components of an organism's DNA that do not encode protein sequences. Some noncoding DNA is transcribed into functional noncoding RNA molecules (e.g. transfer RNA, ribosomaal RNA, and regulatory RNAs), while others are not transcribed or give rise to RNA transcripts of unknown function."" There have been many discoveries in this area of research but also a few controversies, such as last year's publication of the results of the [ENCODE project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENCODE) which was widely criticized for its broad definition of the term ""functional."" 

Here are some things to consider (some more leading than others):

* Does transcription suggest function?
* Why do genome sizes vary so drastically?
* What new functions might be discovered for noncoding DNA in the future?
* Could large stretches of noncoding DNA provide a selective advantage for some organisms?

Please feel free to speculate as much or as little as you want; we wish to encourage the discussion of peoples' ideas and opinions, not punish them for it.

It's about the Text State Board of Education and the far-right conservatives on the board attempting to force the teaching of ideologies that support their personal beliefs while attempting to exploit the ""weaknesses"" in the theory of evolution.  I put weaknesses in quotes because I don't think there is currently any scientific evidence that does not support the theory of evolution.  Furthermore, there are working examples among us today.  For example, viruses and bacteria constantly evolve ways to resist the drugs we throw at them.  

Story:

I was speaking with a friend this morning about the docu and he says there are weaknesses in evolution to which I asked him to provide an example.  His example consisted of him stating that a new species cannot be create without human manipulation of the genetic makeup of a species in order to create a new species.  He then added that evolution means a new species would evolve from another species.

My retort:

Evolution does not necessarily mean a new species will come into existence.  it means that a species' genetic makeup will change so that new abilities will allow said species to survice in a given environment.  These changes would span generations and thereby be considered an example of evolution.  Bacteria and viruses constantly evolved defenses to different drugs we develop to fight them, which has resulted in a never-ending  battle to develop new drugs to fight their adaptations.

He procedes to tell me that I need to understand evolution and it's flaws before we can talk further, to which I asked him if he was serious and just walked away.

Tomorrow at ""work"" I'm going to have to sit down and examine it in detail, any pointers you could offer would be much appreciated.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

I'm on somewhat of the opposite path as you are, raised agnostic and taught abiogenesis + evolution as the explanation for all life and never even knew that there were thinking people who disagreed. Rejecting that was one of the first things that sent me searching and I found Christianity a compelling alternative. And like you, I've never had any type of religious experience. I can't answer every question but I'm finding that more of it makes sense than I ever thought could.

Fossils of Homo species show a line of evolution and that our species did not arise from itself

In the hominid fossil record, you have neanderthals and erectus/ergaster that are fully erect/bipedal and big brained. They leave signs of tool use, fire, [1] clothing, [2] huts with post-holes, [3] boats, burials and cremations, possibly [4] painted stone dolls and even medicinals and [5] simple flutes for the neanderthals. Both morphologically [shape-wise] (and genetically for the neanderthals, we don't have confirmed erectus DNA), Eskimos and some African groups are as different from each other as what they differ from us.

Then you have orrorin, ardi, and the various australopiths, which were small-brained quadrupedal tree-dwellers that show none of the above characteristics. Habilis (placed in-between by some) is a very fragmentary ""[6] wastebasket taxon"" that has small bits of skulls and teeth likely belonging to multiple species, isn't at [7] the correct time, and in many features is [8] more ape-like than the australopiths. The famed biologist Ernst Mayr describes the large gap:

""The earliest fossils of Homo, Homo rudolfensis and Homo erectus, are separated from Australopithecus by a large, unbridged gap. How can we explain this seeming saltation? Not having any fossils that can serve as missing links, we have to fall back on the time-honored method of historical science, the construction of a historical narrative."", What Makes Biology Unique?, [9] p.198, Cambridge University, 2004

Other (entirely secular) anthropologists such as Charles Oxnard and Herbert Tuttle doubt that australopithicenes were human ancestors at all.

vs natural evolution

Arguing against evolution is a lot easier than in favor of special creation. So I'll have a go at that :P

Consider the diverse collections of genes/protiens we observe among living organisms--the meat and potatoes of functional genomes and what it would take to create them. As a benchmark, take observed evolution among the microbes. HIV (radically different from cellular life, but the highest dN/dS I know of) took a population of 1020 all mutating random combinations to evolve a few new binding cites, malaria (p falciparum) 1020 before finding the right two nucleotides to flip to gain chloroquine resistance under strong selective pressure, and all other examples among hundreds of well-studied microbial species are as slow or slower. Yet among about 1012 ancestors since a chimp divergence, millions of times fewer mutations and selections than the microbes, we would've had to evolve something like [10] 280-1400 new genes/proteins through duplications, fusions, de novo from non coding DNA, and some without homologs at all. These are members of over 20 new gene families and are found active in human neocortal development, among other areas.

Attempting a crude quantification, that gives homo a million times less mutational search but a thousand times the result--meaning we would have had to evolve genes/proteins a billion times faster than any observed rate. Functional variants are simply too rare and it requires vast mutational search to find even very small gains.

Then came the modern human out of africa migration and we reconvened, had some sex, and probably wiped them out.

For this week's discussion, we're going to take a look at a topic that has less to do with hard science (whether it can be done) and more about the moral and scientific implications (should it be done) of bringing extinct species back to life.

[National Geographic has a fun interactive webpage that deals with ""de-extinction"" if anyone is interested in an overview of the popular pros and cons.](http://www.nationalgeographic.com/deextinction/) The basic idea is that since humans are in many ways responsible for the extinction of many species going back to the Ice Age, that we also have some sort of obligation to bring them back. While it may be a while before we will see Woolly Mammoths roaming the Great Plains again, it's becoming increasingly imaginable to bring back species that have gone extinct within the last few decades. So the basic question is, should we?

Do we have any obligations to these species to bring them back?

There is also the idea floating around that bringing back certain keystone species back into their (still existing) habitats could be immeasurably beneficial to these habitats that have had niches left empty for thousands of years. 

[A more feasible version of this plan is to bring the ecosystem back to life using extant species as proxies for their extinct relatives.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleistocene_Park) Is this ecosystem resurrection any more or less acceptable for humans to do than species resurrection?

Here are some things to consider (some more leading than others):

* Is it acceptable to bring back *any* species? If so (and ignoring technological problems), then where is the cut-off? 10 years? 100 years? 1000 years?

* Do humans have a *specific moral obligation* to bring back [species whose extinction](http://www.wbu.com/chipperwoods/photos/passpigeon.htm) was directly caused by us?

* Related to the above, would this include the Neanderthals? Who we may have bred and competed out of existence?

* Is ecological resurrection any better or worse than species resurrection?

* Bringing back even a single species would bring about a completely new, human-assisted clause in evolution: that extinct species may not be gone forever. Is toying with the natural evolution of the earth a new problem? Or is it no different than artificial selection?

Please feel free to speculate as much or as little as you want; we wish to encourage the discussion of peoples' ideas and opinions, not punish them for it. If you find someone's ideas lacking scientific support or sense do not downvote them, instead try finding counter-evidence and state your opinion in opposition to win them over to your side.

[The article on this is here](http://www.reasons.org/articles/chromosome-2-the-best-evidence-for-evolution) on his organization's web site, but in short, he argues that telomere-telomere fusion is nearly impossible, that the fusion of an intact chromosome with another chromosome fractured near its telomere in a gamete cell resulting in a viable and fertile offspring is highly unlikely, and a selective sweep throughout the hominid population also highly unlikely. 

What is the biggest flaw in his argument?  Why shouldn't I consider Chromosome 2 to be unhelpful as evidence for common descent?

Edit: Rana answered my rebuttal to his argument on this episode of [*I Didn't Know That*](http://www.reasons.org/podcasts/i-didnt-know-that/unlikely-telomere-tango-the-gravity-god-insight-into-speciation); it starts at the 3:07 mark.",,False,,t5_2qhs7,1374264002.0,,,True,t3_1f8jxr,http://www.reddit.com/r/evolution/comments/1f8jxr/fazale_ranas_creationist_argument_regarding_human/,

So, how did the first pair of cheetahs survive? With only two organisms of a single species, inbreeding must be a real problem.  The only answer I can think of is to say that the first cheetahs were really cheetah-leopards, and so there was a much larger population. So perhaps they could continue to breed with leopards even while they're becoming cheetahs. No, that doesn't make sense because then the two species would never separate.

Even if cheetahs were originally a cheetah-leopard, how did the first cheatah-leopards survive the genetic bottleneck and inbreeding problem. This just pushes the problem back a step without solving it.

I get the idea of countless forks in the road, some leading to dead ends, others keep going.

I've also heard or read somewhere that our common ancestor is most likely something like a shrew.  So I guess my question is if this is true, why is the picture of a monkey gradually standing up to end in a human such an iconic image?

From what I'm aware, evolution advances a species by natural selection and changes on the genetic level. 

My question is what was Homo sapiens last major evolutionary change/benefit? Chimps and apes can do many of the things we can do now, use tools, walk upright, communicate...are our differences just brain size? 

Since humans are still evolving, is it possible to predict what our next change will be? Can we detect what genetic changes (if any) may be happening within our species over the past few thousand years?

Also, I'd like to pick up some evolution 101 reading material. Suggestions?",,False,,t5_2qhs7,False,,,True,t3_bq8ag,http://www.reddit.com/r/evolution/comments/bq8ag/a_question_about_human_evolution/,

Primarily though, it seems that any organism that gained pleasure from sex, and uses sex to reproduce, would eventually come to out-represent other organisms in that species that didn't get pleasure from sex, why does sex not lead to pleasure more often in more species then?

For instance, something like a bird evolving into a horse could never happen (in addition, monkeys to humans). He believes that evolution within species does happen (successful traits are passed on), but only within its own species (bird evolving into a better bird).

I was taught back in high school that evolution occurs over a long period of time and I tried to explain the theory of common descent to the best of my ability. It may not seem like a bird could evolve into a horse but over a long period of time, successful mutations being passed on can cause a species to diverge. In the short term, birds may still be birds but in the long term, this could change completely so that there exists two completely different species but with the same common ancestor. 

In response to this, he expresses the doubt that a species could diverge completely and reasons if humans evolved from monkeys, the fossil records should show this but it appears there is a missing link. The fossil record supports evolution but only up to a certain point and somewhere along the line, there must have been some external interference which triggered the evolution to humans.

So my question is this: Is there an example of a complete divergence of species with a common ancestor? 

With such an example, I think I can convince him that such an evolution is possible.

After thinking about it, I'm genuinely confused about how a trait like that could become fixed in a population.  I tried doing a google search but all I could find were creationist arguments.  I just keep thinking that after the initial fusion in the original gamete, you'd still end up with a zygote that has two incomplete pairs of chromosome.  Or that the resulting organism would have trouble mating with members of his species because they have different numbers of chromosomes.

Does anyone have an explanation or links?

Edit:  Haha so after thinking about this for a week, I had a bit of an epiphany 20 minutes after posting.  I suppose the homologous regions of the 3 chromosomes (fusion + 2 originals) could pair up during mitosis/meiosis.  Does anyone know if this happens?

What type of behavior do hive minded insects or wolf pack like creatures demonstrate, when presented with the realization that all of their hard work has paid off? In the case of bees, I'm talking beyond the stage of swarming. They have all the honey they need , there are no wasps or ants preparing an attack so their defenses are up to par. Do we even have any observable data on this phenomenon? What do these tribes do when their hard work pays off and they have nothing left to do? Do they die of boredom? Develop new missions? What else is out there besides fulfilling your potential? My goal is to use these responses as a seed of inspiration so that i can begin to investigate what occurs at the end of human fulfillment?

I was thinking about it, and the idea behind Natural Selection is that traits that are negative end up not being passed on because they'll limit the ability to survive long enough to mate. Now, though, with modern medicine people are living long enough that the most common negative traits aren't expressing themselves until very late in life, after people have already had the chance to reproduce (and in fact their children may even be having children). Those traits wouldn't be affected by natural selection I assume. 

I want to end this post with a question like ""Does this mean we're mostly done evolving?"" but I know that's a stupid question because there's genetic components, things we may have to adapt to, etc so I guess the better question is are we the end of the line and from here on out it'll always be ""Modern Humans"" but like ""Modern Humans with whipped cream topping"" instead of ""Modern Humans a la mode""?",,False,,t5_2qhs7,False,,,True,t3_rl0kt,http://www.reddit.com/r/evolution/comments/rl0kt/do_you_think_i_would_be_correct_in_assuming/,

When I've thought about the origin of species, I assumed life spawned, then began its journey into looking like we do today.  But techincally, life probably had to spawn multiple times before living long enough to reproduce itself, or simply having the ability to reproduce itself.

Has there been a discussion on this yet?  The probably of life (amino acids) spawning is relatively low (hence it took a long time), but don't we have to factor in that it probably had to randomly spawn a few times?",,False,,t5_2qhs7,True,,,True,t3_f6vr6,http://www.reddit.com/r/evolution/comments/f6vr6/how_many_times_did_life_actually_spawn/,
