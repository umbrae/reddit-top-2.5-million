1352438956.0,2549,self.AskHistorians,12wfcz,"[Meta]  Okay, I'm going to explain this for the last time.",3847,1298,351,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/12wfcz/meta_okay_im_going_to_explain_this_for_the_last/,"In the past two days we have had two threads, one about Puerto Rico statehood and one about ""Why is the South so Conservative"".

Both threads were rather popular, but both were full of empty answers, stereotypes, pun threads, circle-jerking, outright bad information, wild baseless speculation, political soapboxing, and outright awfulness.

Both threads have been nuked from orbit.

We have had a massive influx of new users, who apparently have not bothered to familiarize themselves with the culture of this sub.  The top tier/lower tier answer and casual comment rule is being wildly abused.  Subjects are drifting WAY off topic.  There is to many unsupportable answers.  There is to much of getting up on a soap box to lecture the sub about your political beliefs.

Simply put, it is being abused, and the moderators are going to have to play Social Worker.  

1. Unless the jokes are relevant, they will be removed....and even that is getting pushed to the breaking point.  Meta threads are really the only place where we are looser with the rules on this.

1. Stay on topic or relevant.  Your trip to the gas station today or the pizza you ate today had better be relevant, or it goes.

1. Keep it in /r/politics.  No seriously, I'm not kidding.  Any discussion of modern politics after the early 90's will be nuked.  It has to be VERY RELEVANT to be allowed after that.

1. Posts had better start being backed up, no more idle speculation.  There are far to many posts that are just random wild guesses, half-informed, or are based on what is honestly a grade-school level of understanding of the material.  

This sub has grown massively based on it's reputation, and we are going to maintain it.  You, the user base has to help maintain that reputation, downvote posts that are not fitting of this subs standards, report spam and garbage posts, and hold each other to a higher standard.  

The moderation team does not want to have to turn this completely into /r/askscience in it's strict posting standards, but if we cannot trust the user base to police itself, we will have to continue to enact tougher and tougher standards until this sub becomes what is honestly an overly dry and boring place.

A dead body is discovered in the middle of a well populated area and the overwhelming evidence suggests he was murdered.  Is anyone in charge of finding the killer?

So what was the process to figure out who did it without the modern police?  I assume most murders happen in private.  If someone killed my brother I'd want to know who was responsible.  It's in everyone's best interest to catch the person.  Any special methods or rights given to investigators?

The Eagle Has Landed,2740,806,206,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1h1ogy/special_ama_announcement_the_eagle_has_landed/,"About two months ago, the moderators were discussing amongst themselves who we would get to do an AMA if they could.  This resulted in first our ""Special Guest"" AMA from [Benerson Little](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1fpy0w/wednesday_ama_piracy_from_antiquity_to_the_present/), my personal favorite Pirate Historian, who delivered one of the finest (if not *the* finest) AMA's we've ever had.

Then we decided to swing for the fences.

We hit a Grand Slam.

On July 17th, we will have a multi-participant panel from the [Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum](http://airandspace.si.edu/).  That's right, one of the world's premier institutions of History and Science will be answering your questions about the Apollo 11 Moon landing.  On this panel we are expecting archivists, curators, historians, and more, answering your questions about the Apollo 11 Landing, the Apollo missions, the history of the early space program, it's technology, and what it's like working in a world class museum.  ~~As a special treat, it's likely we also have a person on the panel who is one of the foremost ""Hoax"" debunkers, who is also one of the premier Space and Aviation historians in America.~~  


We hope that you are as excited for this as the moderation team is.

Edit:  I just spoke to the Smithsonian and the gentleman who speaks about hoaxes (amongst many other things) will be unavailable that day.

I will answer questions about the Museum’s Apollo artifacts and current plans to completely redo our exhibit on the early U.S. Human Space flight programs through Apollo. I am especially interested in what people want to see in a Smithsonian Apollo exhibit and what about that period is deemed most interesting and important (and why).

Jennifer Levasseur, museum specialist in Space History
I will address questions regarding small astronaut equipment including space food and hygiene equipment, astronaut photography and cameras, our post-Apollo spaceflight collection, and acquiring objects from NASA.

Cathleen Lewis, curator of international space programs and spacesuits
I will answer questions about the museum’s spacesuit collection and the history of spacesuit development.

1364749573.0,1649,self.AskHistorians,1bd62c,[META] Some Changes in Policies and Rules **Please read**,2413,764,1698,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1bd62c/meta_some_changes_in_policies_and_rules_please/,"Over the past year r/AskHistorians has grown from a small community of historinerds to a subreddit that gets touted on r/AskReddit as a “must-have.” While the consistent influx of new subscribers (~10K per month on average over the past 6 months) has brought new contributors and new viewpoints, it has also meant that a lot of the same historical ground gets covered, re-covered, and covered again.

The mods of r/AskHistorians have attempted to contain this repetition by pointing questioners to our FAQ, and many contributors to this sub have done the same (for which we thank you!). This has not been enough though, and certain topics get brought up so frequently as to drown out other areas of inquiry. We mods have thought long and hard about how to handle this, but have unanimously settled on the following rule changes as the only viable solution to the problem:


1)  **No more questions about Hitler**  We are constantly saturated by questions about what did Hitler think of cap and trade, the infield fly rule, Coke or Pepsi.  It delves into the absurd at times, and honestly blocks the access to better questions.  Therefore, in order to improve the quality of the sub, we will spin all Hitler questions off into /r/askaboutHitler.  A sub completely dedicated to the history of Adolf Hitler.

2)  **Starting next week (4/8), r/AskHistorians will no longer be accepting questions about World War II. Those posted will be removed.**  This may seem like a drastic measure – we mods acknowledge this – but we also feel that it is the only way to keep our community asking fresh and interesting questions about history. At this point, there is simply nothing left to ask and answer about WWII in this subreddit; everything has been covered already. In the future, we may phase out other topics that have been frequently and completely covered, such as Rome and Vikings. In the meantime, make sure to visit the new queue and upvote intriguing and novel questions there! Just not ones about Nazis.  Please visit the future /r/askaboutWWII for your questions.



3)  **Poll type questions will return with a twist**.  We removed poll type questions like ""Which General had the nicest uniform,"" or ""Which King was the most Kingly"" because they were heavily subjective and full of bad information.  However, they were also immensely popular.  So, we decided to re-allow them with a twist.  If you want to ask a poll question, as the OP you must now keep editing your post to keep a tally of all the answers and reasons within your top post.  This allows people to keep from repeating answers.

4)  **Jesus is real.  End of story**.  After constant incessant and heated argument, in order to prevent further discord, we have decided to go with the majority opinion of the historical community and state that Historical Jesus is real.  If he was the son of God is still debatable, but it is outside of the purview of this sub.  We will delete any further questions or assertions that Jesus did not historically exist.

5)  **All first hand sources from Greece or Rome must be posted in the original language.**  Due to the heavily contentious nature at times of various translations and word usage, only citations of Greece and Roman literature must be in the original language so that we may see and be able to interpret the wording that you are using.  This allows us to further analyse the first person source.  We will be partnering with /r/linguistics to properly interpret these posts.  

6)  **Going forward all conspiracy nuts, racists, homophobes, and sexists will be pre-emptively banned**.  Going forward, AnOldHope, Eternalkerri, and Algernon_Asimov, will begin going through sexist, racist, and biggoted subs collecting user names and pre-emptively banning those users before they can participate in this sub and try to sneak in bad history.

7)  **Artrw will be stepping down as mod at the end of May**  Art will be backpacking through Europe this summer, and not have access to the internet regularly.  This will leave me as the senior moderator on this sub.  I know this might be a source of concern for you, but I assure you, all the other moderators support this, and will usher in some major changes in the sub going forward.

8)  **We will be allowing pictures from /r/historicalrage and [Historic LOLs](http://roflrazzi.cheezburger.com/history).**  People have often complained that we are to serious here, so we will begin experimenting with allowing a few meme jokes.  This will allow us to not be seen as such a stuffy and unfun sub.  We want users to enjoy themselves, and feel that these are relative comics and can serve a decent purpose here.

9)  **Due to complaints from multiple users, all dates must be cited in both Gregorian, but culturally specific dates**.  This means all dates involving Muslims must be cited in the Muslim Calender, Chinese the Chinese calender, Jewish dates in the Jewish calender, etc.  We do not wish to offend any users culture, and are doing this to accommodate them and bridge a cultural divide. 

10)  **Sports questions are exempt from the 20 year rule**  Due to the growing disinterest in academic study of sports, we are exempting all sports from the 10 year rule.  This will hopefully increase the academic interest in athletics not only currently but in the study of the past.


We understand the gravity of these changes, and understand that they will be contentious, that is why they will not be implemented for a week.  This will allow the community to adapt to these changes, and discuss it amongst themselves.  However, they will not be subject to being dis-allowed; the moderation team has discussed this heartily in back channels and agree that these changes are for the best for the sub.

Thank you, and enjoy your Easter.  God Bless.


**EDIT**  I know some of you are very pissed off about these changes, but any impolite dissent will be removed.

And sticky posts are a thing now!  Yes!

***--Preamble--***

/r/AskHistorians has grown from humble beginnings to become the leading community on Reddit when it comes to historical discussion.  It could never have happened without the almost 175,000 people who have chosen to read and contribute here, and we thank you sincerely for all the help and content you've provided!

Nevertheless, this community expects the moderation team to uphold certain standards in /r/AskHistorians, and one aspect of that is providing guidelines for what constitutes a good answer.  This community has justifiably high expectations when it comes to the content that gets posted here, and it's important that those expectations are obviously and properly articulated.

If you've been reading regularly over the last two years (yes, it has very nearly been that long!), you'll have noticed from time to time that not every answer to the questions asked here is created equally in terms of its quality, accuracy and overall usefulness.  With /r/AskHistorians growing all the time, and new readers constantly joining us, it would be worthwhile to return to the question of what makes a good answer.

The moderators in /r/AskHistorians are frequently asked about this.  Usually this happens while we're in the unhappy process of removing someone's comment, but it's a subject that could stand to be expanded on somewhat.  The official rules [have a lot to say](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_all_answers_are_not_created_equal) on the matter, but one can always say more.

Before we get to that, I would like to emphasize a matter of principle which informs everything that follows.  It is not meant as some stern rebuke or haughty dismissal, but just as something to be considered.  It's a thing that may at first seem surprising.  I say this not because it's counter-intuitive, but rather because so many of those who end up posting in here seem to forget it.  It is this:

**We do not have to post here.**

Let's pause for a moment to consider that.

We do not have to post here.

You and I both have no obligation to post a single word in /r/AskHistorians, and this is true no matter who we are.  Everything that happens here is strictly voluntary.  You chose to subscribe, if indeed you are a subscriber, and you're choosing to read this right now.  Everyone who asks or answers a question does so only because they want to, not because they have to.  Every flaired user had to voluntarily put in the work necessary to earn that flair, and then voluntarily maintain a standard of posting sufficient to retain it.  Each and every one of our moderators is here purely by choice.

There are two important consequences to this:

1. We are not obliged to post.
2. We are not entitled to post.

It would be perfectly fine (if not at all desirable) for every question asked in /r/AskHistorians to go completely unanswered.  Many questions do, in fact -- and that's okay.  I'll explain a bit more about why below, but this is important to keep in mind as we examine what it means to post here.

Pursuant to the second point, no post we make absolutely *has* to show up here.  If a question is too hard for us to answer, or our question is redirected to another subreddit, or our comment is removed for violating one of the subreddit's rules, in no sense have any of our rights been infringed upon.  This is not meant as any kind of rebuke, to be clear -- just something, again, to keep in mind.

So, given all of the above, it is important to further note that **every word we post here is a choice**.  We choose to do it; nobody forces us to.

With that in mind, what sort of choices should we make when answering a question in /r/AskHistorians?

---

***--Self-Examination--***

If you're choosing to answer a question in /r/AskHistorians, there are three questions you should ask yourself first in turn:

1. **Do I, personally, actually know a lot about the subject at hand?**

2. **Am I essentially certain that what I know about it is true?**

3. **Am I prepared to go into** ***real detail*** **about this?**

If the answer to any of these questions is ""no"", please think twice about posting.  If the answer to *all* of them is no, **do not post at all**.

Let's break down what is meant by the above three questions.

- **1. Do I, personally, actually know a lot about the subject at hand?**

In /r/AskHistorians, we are looking to connect inquiring readers with people who are **actually knowledgeable** about the subjects at hand.  It's as simple as that.  If you are *not* actually knowledgeable, please *do not post at all*. You're certainly allowed to ask a follow-up question, if you have one, but do not attempt to answer a question unless you, personally, have done a great deal of research on the subject at hand.

If you have to suddenly research something you've never heard of before...  If you have to preface your comment with ""I don't really know"", or something like it...  If your answer is based on something you only may have heard in school a decade ago...

**Do not post.**

- **2. Am I essentially certain that what I know about it is true?**

While ""truth"" is a notoriously tricky concept, we earnestly request that you not post unless you have personally conducted enough research into the subject to be convinced that a particular position has good warrants.  This is not to say that only mainstream opinions are permissible in /r/AskHistorians, for the nature of historiography demands that it constantly be open to revision based on new information and new perspectives, but anything you choose to post here should be something that you believe in enough to defend, and that you would be prepared *to* defend if challenged.  It should go without saying that you should have good reasons -- and good sources to back it up -- for believing in the truth of what you say.

Pursuant to the above, if you wish to present a perspective on a matter being discussed in /r/AskHistorians that you must candidly admit to yourself is not that of the mainstream, but which you nevertheless believe to be correct, you are absolutely welcome to do so -- just be prepared to make it clear *why* you feel justified in saying it, and *why* you feel the more widely held view of the matter should be challenged.  In short, revisionism is [not necessarily a dirty word](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1ito8g/open_roundtable_what_we_talk_about_when_we_talk/) -- just be absolutely open about it from the very start.

Otherwise: If your prospective answer is mostly speculation...  If you think you may have heard it on TV once, but aren't sure...  If the basis for your answer is anything other than historical facts that you could personally reference and support if asked...

**Do not post.**

- **3. Am I prepared to go into *real detail* about this?**

This is important.

As many contributors have found out to their dismay, single-sentence answers are never, ever good enough in /r/AskHistorians.  There's always more to be said about a given subject, and our readers come here to receive in-depth and substantive answers from people who have put a great deal of time and effort into their study.

By ""real detail"", we primarily mean this: a comment that *actually answers the question in depth*.  Consider the following possibilities...

A user asks this question: ""What is the historical consensus on whether or not King David was real?""

If you were asking it, which answer would you rather receive?

- 1a. ""The Bible is stupid and should not be trusted."" (whole answer)

- 1b. ""I'm not a historian, but I remember reading once that some scholars are unsure if he was really a historical figure.  He probably wasn't.""  (whole answer)

- 1c. [Link to ""Let Me Google That For You"" with ""King David"" as the search term] (whole answer)

- 2a. [A paragraph saying that he didn't exist, concluding with a link to a Wikipedia article]

- 3a. [A short multi-paragaph essay explaining what the Old Testament says about David, what has been discovered archaeologically since the 19th C., what scholars in the field think today, and some ways in which that might be complicated]

Lest you think that answers 1a through 1c are strawmen, I can assure you that I and the rest of the moderating team have to remove comments of that caliber and depth on an hourly basis.

Answer 2 is perhaps useful, but it's still not what we're after here -- but I'll leave that to my colleague /u/caffarelli to explain in greater depth in a bit.

Anyway, if you're anything like the typical /r/AskHistorians reader, you'll be wanting something like answer 3.  And why shouldn't you?  We have thousands of active users here providing answers of this sort every single day, on any number of different topics, and getting such a useful, comprehensive answer from one of them is the hoped-for consequence of asking a question here in the first place.  

**So why do so many users think that 1a through 1c are worth posting?**  They obviously do, because we get literally hundreds of comments like this every day.  If you're reading this, take it to heart -- *don't post answers like those ones ever again*.  Unless you're both willing and able to work towards an answer like 3, please think twice before answering a question at all.

Detail isn't always a matter of length, either; it is abundantly possible to say in a single paragraph all that needs to be said on the matter, and it is just as possible to spend an entire essay saying nothing whatever of value.  Over the course of my career I am confident that I've managed to achieve both, from time to time, but obviously they're not of equal merit.

So: if you only feel like providing a sentence or two... If you know so little about the subject that your facts are fewer than your speculations... If you don't understand the terms of the question and want to talk about something else instead... If you have to preface your comment with an apology about its probable lack of utility...

**Do not post.**

All of this having been said... what does an actually good answer look like?

Let's take a look...

---

***--What you SHOULD do--***

In /r/AskHistorians, our mandate is to connect inquiring readers with people who possess deep reserves of knowledge on the subjects at hand.  Over the course of this subreddit's existence, we've been remarkably fortunate in the quality of specialists we've been able to attract.  We have university professors and published authors; practicing attorneys and globe-trotting archaeologists; research librarians and digital humanities wizards.  We also have plenty of people with jobs that have nothing to do with history, whose education was in another field, and who routinely post high-quality answers all the same.  In /r/AskHistorians, it's not about where you come from -- it's about what you can *do*.

So... what *should* you do?

There are five things to keep in mind once you've decided you're able to post an answer in /r/AskHistorians:

**A)** A good answer answers the OP's question in the terms it sets out.  This obviously becomes difficult if the question itself is afflicted by problems, but in that case the good answer will be the one that identifies those problems and attempts to produce a better question in its stead -- and answers it.  

**B)** A good answer is based upon and expressive of a deep reserve of knowledge of the subject at hand.  Your choice to answer a question in /r/AskHistorians reflects your serious degree of confidence in the truth of what you say and your ability to say a lot about it.

**C)** A good answer anticipates likely follow-up questions rather than ignoring them.  If, in the course of providing your answer, you have to make reference to people, places, things or events that are likely to be news to the OP, don't just wait for them to ask you about it -- provide proper context and explanation up front.  So, for example, if you're answering a question about who the most prominent British propagandists of the First World War were, don't just say ""Lord Northcliffe"" and leave it at that.  The inquiring poster is likely not going to be casually familiar with Northcliffe, or with Crewe House, or with the War Propaganda Bureau, or with the complexities of the Ministry of Information.  These are easily-anticipated questions, and it behooves you to try to provide at least a modicum of substance about them up front.

**D)** A good answer *accepts that the person asking does not know a lot about it* and attempts to remedy this in a polite and friendly manner.  While there are absolutely [certain types of questions](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_questions) that we officially discourage in /r/AskHistorians, there are no questions that we believe to be intrinsically stupid unless they're intended as such.  The people asking questions here are doing so out of an honest desire to learn, and if you can only respond to them with condescension or contempt we request that you find some other subreddit in which to ply your trade.  

**E)** Finally: better no answer than a poor answer.  The mandate of /r/AskHistorians can be expressed in two simple terms:

- To promote a better understanding of history on Reddit.
- To do so by connecting inquiring readers with people capable of providing in-depth and accurate answers to their questions, as all of the above should show.

This is what we do here.  This is the job before us.

In light of this, poor, speculative, sketchy, uncertain answers **are not contributions -- they are obstacles**.  Do not post answers you aren't sure about in the hope that someone will come along and correct you.  Do not post hopelessly incomplete answers based on a skimming of a Wikipedia article just because nobody has yet replied after a few hours.  *Do not guess.*  **Do not invent**.

---

***--Conclusion--***

I'll wrap this up with a **TL;DR:** 

Answering a question in /r/AskHistorians is a choice, and when you make that choice you affirm that you have given the subject on which you're writing a considerable amount of time as a researcher.  You are confident that what you say is true, and do not have to qualify it untowardly; you are going to go into significant detail as you describe what you know, and will not resent or reject requests for further information; you will respect the person asking the question and attempt to help them however you can.  You will say everything you need to in order to provide an immediately useful answer to the question at hand, and you will be prepared to say more if necessary.

These are the pre-requisites for properly answering a question in /r/AskHistorians.

As such, we have had a massive influx of new users who may or may not be aware of our culture, or methods, or how we work around here.

  So, firstly let me cover the old rules [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/z9uyg/meta_widescale_revisions_to_the_official_rules/).

You need to read those and remember them.

Now, what I'm about to talk about next are *not* rules but may become rules, and are most definitely approaching deletion and moderator intervention.

1.  **REDDIT POLITICS IS OFF LIMITS**.  None of the SRS/anti-SRS/Gawker/VA/SRD stuff is allowed here.  **Period.**  If you want to discuss the finer points of SRS/SRD, etc., go elsewhere.

1. **Top tier/bottom tier guidelines are being abused, and will be brought back within tolerable limits**  There is far to much topic drift, idle speculation (more on that in a second), off topic humor, bad humor, etc.  We do not want to make this /r/askscience, but constantly running off topic, bad jokes, meme's, etc., have made us decide we are going to have to tighten up.  **All posts must be somehow relevant to the thread**  

1. **Academic rigor is a slipping in this sub, and will be addressed**.  With a lot of new members showing up, who aren't familiar with [Historiography](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historiography), and [Historical Method](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_method).  Additionally, my personal pet peeves... [Presentism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentism_%28literary_and_historical_analysis%29), [The Historian's Fallacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historian%27s_fallacy), and [Chronological Snobbery](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronological_snobbery).    For those of you who may not understand.  If you want to criticize Churchill, Gandhi, Columbus, Caesar, George Washington on moral issues, the decisions they made, and why they made them, you must consider *what they knew, when they knew it, and why it was that way*.  Don't criticize Columbus for human rights concepts that wouldn't exist for another 250 years.  Don't get upset at Gandhi for doing something that was perfectly normal culturally for him.  Don't criticize Churchill for acting completely within the Victorian value system he was raised in.  

1.  **You want to introduce a wild theory?  Bring your A-game**  So you want to claim that the Navy let Pearl Harbor happen and hid evidence from Roosevelt?  You better have your sources stacked up next to you and where others can view them.

1.  **Baseless speculation is HIGHLY DISCOURAGED**  Don't know? Don't answer!  You are gumming up the works with baseless guesses that are usually terrible answers.

1.  **Go to the political subreddit of your choice if you want to soapbox**  Seriously, you aren't advancing any new political theories here, and no one wants to hear your manifesto.  Go somewhere else.

1.  **Broad questions like: 'What are some of histories greatest Generals', 'What is a crazy fact about your period?', 'Tell me a cool story about...' Are tiresome, and becoming repeated regularly, we HIGHLY discourage them, they are essentially trivia warehouses, and often become simply over-run with really terrible, terrible information.**

1. **WE HAVE AN FAQ!  PLEASE CHECK IT BEFORE ASKING!**  

1. **Use quality sources.**  We will still allow wiki in a pinch, but citing *angrydemocratblog.com"", or ""secrettruthabouttesla.net""  probably won't cut it.  Basically, if you wouldn't include it in a paper you are turning in for a grade, don't use it here.

I pester the subreddit a lot about all matters North Korea, and because the country's been in the news so much recently, we thought it might be timely to run an AMA for people interested in getting more information on North Korean history and context for their present behavior.

A little housekeeping before we start:

 - **/r/AskHistorians is relaxing its ban on post-1993 content for this AMA.** A lot of important and pivotal events have happened in North Korea since 1993, including the deaths of both Kim il-Sung and Kim Jong-il, the 1994-1998 famine known as the ""Arduous March"" (고난의 행군), nuclear brinkmanship, some rapprochement between North and South Korea, and the Six-Party Talks. This is all necessary context for what's happening today.

 - **I may be saying *I'm not sure* a lot here.** North Korea is an extremely secretive country, and solid information is more scanty than we'd like. Our knowledge of what's happening within it has improved tremendously over the last 25-30 years, but there's still a lot of guesswork involved. It's one of the reasons why academics and commenters with access to the same material find a lot of room to disagree.

I'm also far from being the world's best source on North Korea. Unfortunately, the good ones are currently being trotted around the international media to explain if we're all going to die in the next week (or are else holed up in intelligence agencies and think tanks), so for the moment you're stuck with me.

 - **It's difficult to predict anything with certainty about the country.** Analysts have been predicting the collapse of the Kim regime since the end of the Cold War. Obviously, that hasn't happened. I can explain why these predictions were wrong, I can give the historical background for the threats it's making today, and I can construct a few plausible scenarios for what is *likely* happening among the North Korean elite, but I'm not sure I'd fare any better than others have in trying to divine North Korea's long-term future. Generally speaking, prediction is an art best left to people charging $5.00/minute over psychic hotlines.

 - **Resources on North Korea for further reading:** [This is a list of English-language books and statistical studies](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1403l7/askhistorians_master_book_list_ii/c78zzl9) on North Korea that you can also find on the [/r/AskHistorians Master Book List](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/books). All of them except Holloway should be available as e-books (and as Holloway was actually [published online](http://www.aidanfc.net/a_year_in_pyongyang.html), you could probably convert it).

While this has not often come up in /r/AskHistorians, certain recent events have put the question on our radar and we feel bound to come to some sort of decision on the matter. I will stress at once that we are not on the verge of implementing any particular rule -- this post is meant to seek reader opinion in a bid to make any eventual decision one that has a semblance of consensus.

The situation is this:

While it is very rarely a concern, it is sometimes the case that questions asked in /r/AskHistorians are phrased in such a way that the very questions themselves are NSFW. There is an existing Reddit-wide provision for tagging NSFW question as such, but this doesn't necessarily help those who are accessing /r/AskHistorians on a network that has content filters that will pick up NSFW words and react accordingly. To put it another way, an NSFW tag may stop you from looking at such a thread at work in full, but it may not stop the *title* of that thread being brought to your IT department's attention even if you're just looking at /r/AskHistorians' front page.

**Edit:** Since there seems to be a primary focus in the commentary below about the implications of this for those at work, I should say that I was remiss in forgetting to mention that the same thing could apply to those accessing /r/AskHistorians from a school computer.

There appear to be two potential options before us:

1. A ban on obviously NSFW language in post titles; users asking questions are encouraged to make their titles as SFW as possible, and are free to subsequently go into whatever graphic detail they wish in the body of their submission.  Questions with titles in violation of this rule will be removed, and those asking the question will be PM'd a request to resubmit with a revised title.  An acceptable title would be something like ""I have a NSFW question about [culture/epoch/whatever]"", but that's only one possible way to approach it.  It could also simply involve rephrasing everything in the question title into a more clinical, reserved sort of tone.

2. No change; users may continue to include NSFW language in their question titles, though they would still be required to put a ""NSFW"" tag on the submission itself.

We're hoping to get some feedback on these possibilities before moving forward with anything.  Alternative viewpoints are gladly welcomed.

And just to be **absolutely clear:** we have **no** intention of banning questions about NSFW subjects.  You can ask about anything you wish.  What should be under discussion here is how such questions are presented, not their very existence.",Meta,True,,t5_2ssp3,1365112377.0,meta,military,True,t3_1boh63,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1boh63/meta_seeking_reader_opinions_on_possible_rules/,moderator

[Here's the comment I talked about.](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1jxpt3/til_when_alexander_the_great_was_a_child_his/cbjdn12)

I concluded that you'd have to know something about ancient history and the context of the story: what was Alexander's life like, how reliable was the person wrote this down, how often Alexander did things like this, did the contemporary people often make up something like this for the sake of propaganda or a cult of personality, was there lots of outlandish stories like this that actually have been verified by multiple sources etc. 

I don't even know if these factors are important or if there's more things you'd have to take into account. Until you know something about the context, it's really hard to estimate how likely or unlikely this event actually was.

I don't know any of that so that's why I am asking you. How likely is it that this event actually happened in some form? Whether or not this took place: why was this written and who was meant to read it?

&gt;This is a work of fiction. Names, characters, places and incidents either are the product of the author's imagination or are used fictitiously. Any resemblance to actual persons, living or dead, events, or locales is entirely coincidental

So this question might be pointless...

I'll be departing from the usual format of Tuesday Trivia to return -- somewhat fittingly for this subreddit -- to the past.

We've gained over a *hundred thousand subscribers* in the intervening time, and vastly expanded the participation of those with special areas of focus, so I'd like to ask it again!

So, readers of /r/AskHistorians -- what's the one that sets your teeth on edge even though you can see it coming from a mile away?  What does everyone just seem to zero in on?  What are you sick of having to talk about?  Obviously we're all here because we *like* sharing our love of history with others, but that doesn't mean it's all smiles and sunshine.

As is usual in the daily project posts, moderation will be considerably lighter here than is otherwise the norm in /r/AskHistorians.

I really hate to put this out here while we have another Mod post that is trying to [collect the FAQ,]( http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/zirmo/meta_lets_do_this_faq_together/) but this needs to be said.

We are almost to 40k subscribers, which has been an insane amount of growth in the few months this sub has been here.  With growth comes growing pains.  There was the AMA debacle (sorry!), and now we are starting to experience an increase in racist revisionists and outright trolls.

We don't want to make this place /r/askscience because the simple nature of history is open to interpretation and opens discussion on a million other topics that can branch off.  People who want to stir up trouble will take this as a sign of weakness and try to exploit this sub and ruin it for everyone. 

That's why we, the Mod team need your help.  All of us have either full time jobs or are full time students and can't dedicate ourselves to this sub 24/7.  We receive at least twenty new questions a day, some of which can generate hundreds of responses in just an hour or two.  This can create quite a headache for this sub as we want to maintain the standard we have set for ourselves (great job to you the members of this sub for helping set it).  So, we are asking for your help.

**Could you please use the ""report"" button to report any trolling, verbal abuse, racism, sexism, or other bigotries to the mod team.**  That will be the most valuable role that you can play here to help us keep this sub at a higher standard.  Only use the report button for blatantly obvious incorrectness i.e. ""The South Won the Civil War,"" type stuff.  That way we can use it mostly to police up the occasional riff raff that drift into our fair sub.

This sub is your home, your place to discuss history and learn something new.  We the Mods are the facilitators and custodians, and we need your help to keep the standard high.

Oh, and a final point.  Please keep the speculation on questions to a minimum.  If you can't provide a quality answer, please don't throw something to the wall and hope it sticks.

Recent events in my life have caused me to re-evaluate priorities in life.  This ranges from my job, to my academic career, to my love life, my hobbies, to well...a ton of things. 

With what I want to accomplish in my life going forward, the internet will be a bit of a distraction. Instead of looking at history subs or web comics, short news articles, etc., I'm looking to accomplish things that will improve my quality of life, my personal happiness

So, I want to take a step back from moderating for a while until I can achieve a balance in my life. I don't want to quit at all. I love this place. I'm proud of it. As lame as it sounds, it's actually a source of pride for me when I talk to people in real life. I discovered this place when I went to create ""askhistorians"" myself, just to discover Artrw had already created it. I knew right away, I wanted to make this place awesome, just like askscience. I started participating, helping to create the academic, professional atmosphere it has today. I created many of the formative rules that we adhere to still, and helped pick some of the first of the new moderators. I've enjoyed every bit of it.  This is my internet child.

That's why I don't want to quit in total and walk away. I still like this place, and want to be a part. What I would like to do, is take on the role of 'moderator emeritus' (my flair would change to denote that status). I would not always be involved in the daily running of this sub, I would not be active in deciding flair, or bans, or major rule changes. I would sometimes offer my two cents worth if I feel it is necessary, advise on things, participate if summoned. This would mean that I still am a moderator, I'm just...less active and not necessary to make minor changes to the sub.

Perhaps in time I would be more active once I have achieve a work/life balance that works better for me. Yet, as it stands now I want to start to step back, and well...take some me time. Become a better person in the world away from the internet.

Oh, and I will always be ready to smack the taste out of racist bigot's mouths.

My understanding/summary from y'all's help; comments/discussion on this would be great, especially if I've misunderstood something:

Carter isn't **technically** correct because at least one shot was fired by Americans during Operation Eagle Claw. However, that was *extremely* small, and was literally just a few shots, so he's right there were no major boots-on-the-ground operations or aerial campaigns by the US military under his administration

HOWEVER - he funded actions that were arguably proxy wars, providing logistical support to Mobutu (but not lethal weaponry directly) in Zaire. His administration also funded the mujahideen, Ethiopian fighters, and later Somali fighters when the Soviets began supporting the Ethiopians. Support for the Nicaraguan contras began under Carter as well.

All this was largely logistic support, and Carter did indeed generally avoid directly providing weapons to anybody for proxy wars. 

Not so in Indonesia. The Carter administration, according to comments below, **provided weapons and funds to support the brutal and murderous Indonesian invasion of East Timor.** where the number of civilian casualties, while disputed, [seems comparable to the ongoing war in Iraq](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_invasion_of_East_Timor#East_Timorese_casualties)

With this information, we can all be the judge of how peaceful the Carter administration was - I argue that we need to also consider it in relation to other post-war administrations, but should be careful in using such relativistic standards as basis for normative judgment.

I first heard about this a few years ago when I read [this post](http://www.cracked.com/forums/index.php?topic=71139.msg1594966#msg1594966) on the Cracked forums:

&gt;Most of us are incapable of fathoming such evil that is child molestation, especially incest.  And so we almost never suspect it, even under the most dire evidence.  I read once that the misconception that it's possible to catch an STD from a toilet seat arose because of such obliviousness.  Doctors couldn't understand why children were catching the same infections their parents had.  It seemed the only possible answer.

That post caught my eye when I first saw it, but I never looked into it. For whatever reason, I recently remembered it and decided to do a bit of research.

From [Lynn Sacco](http://works.bepress.com/lynn_sacco/):

http://www.faqs.org/childhood/Th-W/Venereal-Disease.html

&gt;Doctors were vexed as to how so many girls had become infected, particularly those from white middle- and upper- class families, which white professionals considered respectable. Many white professionals believed that only foreign or ignorant men abused their daughters and so assumed that INCEST occurred only in poor, working-class, immigrant, or African-American families. When the evidence increasingly pointed to men from their own class, doctors, public health officials, social reformers, and educators speculated that girls could become infected from nonsexual contacts with toilet seats, towels, or bedding–modes of transmission doctors had already rejected for adults and boys. Doctors based their speculation on the fact that the epithelial lining of girls' genitals is so thin that it provides little protection against bacteria. They knew it was unlikely that soiled objects could spread gonorrhea because the bacteria dry quickly when exposed to air, yet without proof that even one girl had become infected after using the school toilet, from 1900 to the 1940s, health care professionals ignored the possibility of sexual assault and insisted instead that girls faced the greatest risk of exposure in the school lavatory.

http://www.faqs.org/childhood/In-Ke/Incest.html

&gt;Historians have shown how twentieth-century rhetoric may have hidden more abuse than it exposed. The strangerperpetrator, so threateningly portrayed in mid-twentieth-century media, diverted attention from more likely perpetrators in the home. Freud's notion of children's innate sexuality and his belief that memories of sexual abuse represented unconscious wishes stressed the erotic nature of children and caused many professionals to question the validity of memories of sexual abuse. Even as concern about sexual abuse grew throughout most of the twentieth century, most experts resisted the idea that incest might be common.

&gt;Conclusion

&gt;While the bacteria which cause gonorrhoea could survive for several hours in dried purulent discharge on a toilet seat, the survey failed to find any. Nonsexual transmission from toilet seats is not impossible, just very unlikely. The authors give some interesting ways in which pathogens can be transmitted.

1361232821.0,778,self.AskHistorians,18s8yr,[Meta] Why I'm leaving this subreddit,1196,418,395,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/18s8yr/meta_why_im_leaving_this_subreddit/,"Today I came across several posts to a question about how Lincoln was perceived.  Unholycheese copy-pasted in several relevant, informative and timely sections from two different high-quality sources which answered OP's question, and he cited where he took them from.  EternalKerri stated this was not acceptable on this sub, and I asked (and still wonder) why copy-paste info, *when it's of high quality*, is not wanted here.  

This led to a series of back and forth posts between several other users and mods, and ended with most of the comments being deleted, and a new rule specifically outlawing copy-pasted information being the bulk of a post.  Here's what I have a problem with:

Sometimes there won't be a user who's an authority on a subject.  If it's proclaimed that the only good content here is original content, some questions will not get answered.  Sure, the user in question could have added some BS lines of his own commentary to supplement the quotes, but he/she probably wasn't an expert on the subject, and that would have at best added nothing to the discussion.  Also,

One of the replies I got to my [polite question on what was the matter with his post](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/18rhoh/how_was_lincoln_portrayed_in_the_confederacy/c8hfovv), from /u/eternalkerri was downright rude.  The comment was deleted, so I've pasted it below:

&gt;Because anyone can bloody google and go look at an article. People come here for discussion, for an analysis, and for information, not any little thing they can look up themselves.
&gt;And this was addressed in a moderator post over a month ago..
&gt;Copypasta is against the rules. Period.
  

Ignoring the fallacies in his/her argument, I'm not going to continue to contribute to a subreddit where I get berated and swore at by the mods, especially when their own rules state ""Flaired users are held to a higher standard. They must be polite, helpful, and comprehensive in every comment they make.""  

This subreddit still has a lot of great content - probably the majority of it is.  The issue I have is the mods have swung so far to the dictatorial side of moderating that good, quality content is getting deleted even when it's the only answer to a question, and users are getting flamed for asking questions.  /r/askscience should be a model for how an academic subreddit should be run - they ask for and strive to get the most helpful, usually original content answer to each question that's possible, but their moderation isn't so onerous as to delete completely accurate, helpful information which probably answers the question better than any redditor could, just because it was copied from a historical journal.

And they definitely don't delete it, then edit their rules retroactively when the users protest.  I'd paste in that post too, but the thread I'm referencing has now been obliterated.

tl;dr, this is a quality thread that's being stifled by moderation for the sake of moderation.   And also mod's like eternalkerri posting quality posts such as:

&gt;Okay William Wallace (or based on your posting history Che).
&gt;Spare us the ""MAH FREEDOMS!"" rhetoric.
&gt;I get it, you believe in the freedoms of teh interwebs. Well, sorry. Thats not how it works here. The moderators create and enforce the rules. These are the rules, and they are enforced. You don't like it, go kill a Russian nobleman.
&gt;And yes, I am the mean mod.

**Edit** - I want to clarify that while I disagree with not allowing copy-pasted posts of quality material, the reason I'm abandoning this subreddit is because of the behavior of the mods.  /u/eternalkerri chose in this thread to double down about his/her behavior.  If the mods are going to judiciously enforce rules that are not posted on the rules list, while ignoring their own rules, I'm not going to contribute any more [quality](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/16fdu8/strong_supporters_of_the_us_constitutions_2nd/c7vo90o) [posts](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/14vjli/were_people_allowed_to_move_freely_within/c7h0cb3) to this subreddit.  /r/AskSocialScience might be smaller and a bit lawless, but I'll take that to what's happening to this subreddit.",Meta,False,,t5_2ssp3,1361323088.0,meta,,True,t3_18s8yr,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/18s8yr/meta_why_im_leaving_this_subreddit/,

* /u/caffarelli can cover the castrati (castrated male soprano/contralto singers), as well as general eunuch questions about the physicalities of castration, including sex, what they looked like, and how ‘the deed was done.’ And, as someone here once saw my flair and asked me if I *was* a castrato, let’s get it out of the way: I’m a lady, with all my ladyparts! 

(Quick disclaimer: /u/caffarelli is too poor for cable and does not watch Game of Thrones, so if you’re asking a question based on the eunuchs who are in that show please give me some background!) 

* /u/lukeweiss can talk about the Chinese court eunuchs and their role in Imperial China 

* /u/Ambarenya can talk about the Byzantine imperial eunuchs and their role in Byzantium and the early Christian church

So, fire away! 

**EDIT: Greetings visitors from other subreddits,** we noticed this had been posted in other places. Please be mindful of [our subreddit's rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules) and stay on-topic and polite, but otherwise welcome! 

**EDIT the Second:** I am glad so many of you are eager to talk about some of the coolest dudes in history, but please, let the panel answer the questions, that's what we're here for! I'm a bit behind right now but we will respond, I promise! 

**EDIT the Third** The Panel is tired and needs to go out for the evening, so no more answers tonight! If you still have a question that we didn't cover, feel free to post it, but we won't get to it for a little while, so be patient! I am also happy to do follow-ups on the same delay.

I want to know, from a proven and historical standpoint, what the overall consensus was on Hitler as far as what motivated him to be arguably the most influential figure of an entire century, when many of you here at AskHistorians basically make it out to seem like he basically caught lightening in a bottle, got lucky early via the element of surprise, but ultimately fell victim to his Breaking Bad-esque pride.

Being raised a Jew I was taught, and I quote (from Hebrew school): ""The guy was just batshit insane."" This isn't to oversimplify what he did in reality or what you all research, but people don't just flat out surprise the world and try and conquer it all the time. I'm an uninformed, genuinely curious person who is just wondering: with ALL that has been said about the guy, is there a uniform idea within the historical community about just what he felt he was put on Earth to do?

I apologize if this seems like too vague a question. I appreciate the subjectivity/difficulty, not to mention understanding of psychology involved in getting something truly ""historical"" to verify an answer to a question like like this.

I mean look, as I tried (and seemingly failed) to say at the end of my original post, I realize that this is difficult to answer from a purely fact-based and historical sense. I'm not a historian/nor do I know what qualifies as officially ""historical"" versus psychological or philosophical. But I wasn't looking for philosophical musings on ""how could this happen?!"" Obviously, even if Hitler HAD flat out said to someone holding a tape recorder, ""Look, guys, I knew my whole life I wanted to rule the world, kill the Jews, etc,"" that'd only be his own self-analysis with his own personal self-awareness, which it seems he didn't have much of.

What were the slaves rooms like? Were they in the villa compound?




What were the kid’s toys like?




How does our villa look so far? (what should be changed etc)

Two examples from nordic lore:

**""Skogsrå"" or Huldra**
http://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skogsr%C3%A5et
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huldra

A beautiful woman, sometimes naked, that seduces wanderers and hunters in the forest. Seen from behind, her true form appears, either hollowed out lik an old tree or ugly. In some parts of sweden its only a foxtail that peeks out from her dress that can warn her victims.
Can also give gifts from the forest, such as luck with hunting.
Steals the souls of the men she beds.

Also, this creature has a counterpart in the folklore of the coast, where she comes to sailors and fishermen and trades their soul for sex, luck with fishing and most importantly for the fisherman - the promise that the sea will never take him, no matter how horrible the weather.

To understand the implications of this story, you must know about the superstitions regarding women and ships that prevailed  for a long time in sweden. No woman where allowed onto a ship, even meeting a woman while on the way to your boat was enough to bring bad luck.



**""Näcken"" The Neck** 
A young attractive naked male, appearing in water streams, often depicted as playing an instrument, often a fiddle.
Is said to lure people into the stream, where he drowns them.

It is said that the melody of his fiddle is magical in itself, any human who learned to play it was cursed, as he would never be able to stop playing it. Any who dances to the tune, was unable to to stop, and they would play and dance until they died, or where lured down into the waters.

The tales also said that for the price of your soul and/or blood, he could teach you to play the fiddle as masterly as him. For this to happen, you would either seek him out by the stream, or according to some stories at crossroads. It was espescially likely to meet him during the midsummer festivities.

My name is [Geoff Keelan](http://uwaterloo.academia.edu/GeoffKeelan), I am a PhD Candidate at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/history/) in Waterloo, Ontario, and I am a Canadian historian.  I am in my 3rd year and am currently writing a dissertation on [Henri Bourassa, a French Canadian nationalist](http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?id_nbr=8422&amp;PHPSESSID=pr9hf4t19h27c8f96a8suu0sp3), and his understanding of and his impact on Canada’s experience of the First World War.  Since 2008, I have worked for the [Laurier Centre for Military, Strategic and Disarmament Studies](http://www.canadianmilitaryhistory.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/2012-Newsletter-LCMDS-final-ss2.pdf), a [military studies/history research institute](http://www.canadianmilitaryhistory.ca/), where I am a [Research Associate](http://www.canadianmilitaryhistory.ca/geoff-keelan/).  Through the Centre, I have had the opportunity to participate in many different projects and several guided battlefield tours over the years as a student and as a teacher/driver.   I have been fortunate enough to personally see some of the [Canadian battlefields](http://www.canadianmilitaryhistory.ca/category/publications/guidebooks/) of the First and Second World War in northwest Europe (for the First World War battles in France/Belgium and for the Second World War battles in Normandy, Belgium, Netherlands, and a bit of Germany).  I mention these tours and the Centre because they deserve some credit for the historian I am today.

While I would like to say I can answer every question about Canadian history, there are some areas I specialize in over others.  I am primarily a Canadian political historian, but I have also read a lot of military (or War and Society) history and some aboriginal history.  I can’t say I know much about the literature of other fields, like social, labour, or economic history. I focus primarily on Canada’s history from 1867-1919, with a few other subject-specific concentrations I’ve looked at for various projects.  Still, I wanted this to be as open as possible.  So today I am answering all questions about Canadian history, not just the areas where I’m familiar with the literature (that is, exactly what some historians say versus others).  I am hoping my general (but still formidable) knowledge can answer most of your questions. Who doesn’t love a good historiographical question though.

That being said, I’m going to repeat a caveat I sometimes put on my answers: I am always open to corrections (ideally with sources) and clarifications!  I can misremember, not be up to date with recent research, not be aware of another interpretation, or just be plain wrong.  (By the way, if you are another Canadian historian, I’d love to hear from you.)  I know a lot about Canadian history, but certainly not everything. I’ll try to add sources if I think knowing the literature will help the answer, or if I’m asked.   Like any good historian, I should clarify potential problems of plagiarism.  Sometimes there’s imaginary footnotes in my head that I don’t necessarily put into answers. I might take parts of my other answers from Reddit, or essays and articles I’ve written, and re-use them for questions here. I assure you it’s all my own words though.  Sometimes facts/interpretations/ideas will be pulled from historians uncited (never words though), but again, ask if you are curious where I am getting my information.

I want to end with an important point for me.  I think it’s essential that “professional” historians communicate history to the public.  Not that the amateur historians here aren’t informative and interesting, but I believe that there is a professional duty attached to my chosen career.  I see /r/AskHistorians as the perfect place to fulfil that duty.  When I first discovered this subreddit, I didn’t jump right in to answering questions because I was a little wary about “taking it to the streets,” that is, the general public.  But I realised this subreddit is what historians *should* be doing - **explaining, communicating, and enriching the public’s knowledge of history** - and I started to participate a lot more.  Publications, conferences, even lectures, are all well and good, but I can’t think of a better medium than this subreddit to reach such a varied and interested audience and pay attention to a duty I feel is often minimized by my profession.  I hope that today, as a “professional” historian, I can convey to you some small part of the why and the how of Canada’s history alongside its facts.  

**For my fellow Canadians**: our history helps us understand who we were, who we are, and who we will be.  All Canadians know our history. It is the story of our nation and our people, a story that (unbelievably sometimes) ends with all of the Canadian people who live here today.  Simply by being a Canadian in 2013, you are a part of that story and you are a part of our history.  I hope I can help you find out how you got there.

Almost every man is wearing a suit. Very spiffed up.

Documentary shots seem to agree. As xiaorobear kindly pointed out, [it was very common](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEykTo0n9yk).

Is this Hollywood over-idealizing, or did men generally wear suits when in public? Were men who did not mildly looked down upon (much as a man walking shirtless would be today)?

There were ranges for ""good"" suits and mass-produced ones, but it seems hard to imagine *every* man being able to afford *multiple* suits, often dry-cleaning and pressed, with nary a complaint. Were ""common"" suits cheaper back then versus now (inflation adjusted)? Or, did most lower-to-middle class men adapt other tricks to mitigate the costs (wearing the same clothing more times in a row than we do now, etc)?

I'm making this post as a part of the reason why I contribute to r/AskHistorians : I have been disappointed at the level of discourse, but before I unsubscribed I thought I'd make an effort to be the change I'd like to see.

To that end, I'd like to bring the community's attention to today's news:  as a result of the work of independent scholars and activists, the premier database of academic journals has made a slight change to their website.  JSTOR has pdfs of thousands of academic journals, and usually the full run of that journal, extending back sometimes a century.  Access to JSTOR is so expensive that, in general, only research institutions can afford it; faculty and students at 4-year colleges or community colleges might have limited access, or none at all.  And it's prohibitively expensive for most individuals.

But now JSTOR is offering read-only access to most of these materials to everyone -- three articles every two weeks to those who register, and no downloads.  

It is limited access, but is still an incredible opportunity for those interested in history.  Access to academic journals has, in previous generations, required physically travelling to some research library with a subscription.  It might have even required student or faculty status.  In general, these academic articles are written for other historians, not for the general public.  But in a great age of the democratization of information, this expensive resource is now available to all.

I'd like to encourage all the interested historians on this sub who don't already have access to JSTOR to take a look.  It's a hell of a resource; basically the scholarly output of generations of historians, available to the public.

A little background on Chechnya, and on myself:

Chechnya is nominally a part of the Russian Federation in the North Caucasus. Chechnya first came under Russian control in the late 19th century, and has essentially a part of the Russian Empire since then.

The Chechens fought a long war of independence in the 19th century, and fought two more wars with Russia beginning in 1994, and ending roughly in 2004. The Chechens are historically Sufi Muslim. Within Sufism there are several 'paths' to the divine, somewhat like denominations. Sometime in the 20th century, most Chechens followed the Naqshbandiyya path (tariqa), while today they are predominantly Qadiriyya.

The North Caucasus are extremely diverse, with hundreds of ethnicities and languages over the past few hundred years, although the republic of Chechnya is one of the most homogenous countries in the area, with a vast majority of ethnic Chechens.
The issue of language in Chechnya is, like nearly everything regarding contemporary Chechen culture, extremely politicized and pregnant with the politics of history. The native language of Chechnya is Chechen (noxchiin mott in Chechen), a Caucasian language in the Nakh-Daghestanian language family. It is unique to the Caucasus, and is spoken by the great majority of ethnic Chechens living in Chechnya. Throughout Chechnya’s history Cyrillic, Latin, and even Arabic alphabets have been used, depending on the influence of Russification policies, Islam, or anti-Russian nationalism in vogue at the time. Like most other ethnic minorities in the Soviet Union though, most Chechens throughout the twentieth century also spoke Russian. In the early 1990s all non-Cyrillic alphabets were made illegal for use in the Russian federation, and Chechen has since been written in the modified Cyrillic.

I am not a linguist, nor an expert in the language, but I can answer basic questions.

I received my degree in Russian History, with a Thematic Specialization in Political Violence. My dissertation was on the motivations behind Chechen terrorists, particularly suicide bombers. This AMA is a bit of a hybrid, as I am willing to field questions on Chechnya and its history, and also on theoretical terrorism, suicide bombing, and guerrilla warfare as it pertains to Chechnya. I have published two peer reviewed articles on Chechnya, one on the Russian counterinsurgency operation in Chechnya from 1994-1996, and the second on the Chechen insurgency and the development of terrorism.

I will not answer nor address any questions or comments with racist or hateful undertones. This sub is for enlightened and educational historical dialogue, not as a venue for bitter diatribes and hateful rhetoric. Please be respectful. I will not speak on the morality of terrorism. I do not condone terrorism. I recognize terrorism as a form of political communication. Even so, the 'ism' ending on the word implies not only a communicative act, but also an ideology and mindset of 'terror,' and so I recognize that terrorism comprises much more than a single act. There is no universally agreed upon definition of terrorism, so the definition that I use, a combination of two common definitions, one provided by Boaz Ganor and by Rhonda Callaway &amp; Julie Harrelson-Stephens:

&gt; ""Terrorism is defined as any intentional act of violence against civilian targets that do not have the authority or ability to alter government policy, with the purpose of attaining or furthering political aims.""

I will be here for several hours, will be away for the weekend, and will continue answering any left-over questions on Monday.

1366211400.0,597,self.AskHistorians,1cjatl,Meta: A pair of rules announcements,772,175,225,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1cjatl/meta_a_pair_of_rules_announcements/,"***Rules Post Part the First***

Recently there has been a growth in posts asking extremely general questions. These questions often sound extremely similar, and in particular many of them use the phrase ‘in your area of expertise’. Though the questions themselves are well-intentioned, we have received numerous complaints about them. They encourage extremely short replies, and often extremely bad answers. This then often requires moderator intervention due to the large number of responses ignoring our guidelines and rules. The subreddit is intended to be a source of in-depth historical knowledge, and these questions are not taking advantage of that.  

The mod team has therefore agreed that we want to take direct action, much as we did previously regarding poll questions; we are going to be removing these extremely general threads from now on. The aim is twofold; to have less generalised questions posted in the subreddit, and to redirect those generalised inquiries to more appropriate places.  

For those seeking clarification about what ‘more appropriate places’ means, we have two weekly meta threads which suit more trivia-oriented questions and answers; the Tuesday Trivia thread and the Friday-Free-for-All. The former has a particular topic each week, but the latter is explicitly designed to fit questions that don’t quite fit elsewhere.

These are the guidelines that we will be using when removing these kinds of questions:

**One of our key principles regarding questions is that they should be as precise as possible; we do not want threads that will attract only bad answers, or are so generalised that they cannot be answered. We will therefore remove questions that are seeking trivia rather than informed answers.**

**Our guiding rubric is; if a thread can be summarised as ‘tell me random stuff about X through history’ then it falls into this category of trivia rather than looking for in-depth answers which are this community’s main focus. Questions likely to be removed are those asking about all periods and all places at once. If your question begins with the phrase ‘In your area of expertise’ strongly reconsider posting it, or consider making it more specific. For example, perhaps narrowing your question to a specific time period or area, or focusing your topic to enable more informative answers.**

***

***Rules Post Part the Second***

Following our recent meta thread on the issue (found here) we have also decided to implement some measures regarding NSFW threads. For anyone unfamiliar with the term, we mean questions whose content can cause problems in non-private environments.

We would like anyone asking a NSFW question to put the ‘nsfw’ tag on their question after posting it, and we would like them to make the title as SFW (safe for work) as possible. If questions violate this, they will be removed and we will message the OP about reposting that question with a changed title. We are operating on a ‘we know it when we see it’ principle regarding NSFW content in titles.

This is only ever likely to be relevant to a small number of threads, as NSFW questions are not asked that often here. But our aim is to help anyone browsing the subreddit for whom NSFW text may be a problem. In addition, *our only concern here is the titles of threads*. When it comes to the actual posts within the thread, we aren’t concerned about NSFW content at all. These rules are about allowing people to a) know that a thread has NSFW content before looking at the comments and b) making sure no-one gets in trouble for accidentally viewing a NSFW title.",Meta,False,,t5_2ssp3,1366214743.0,meta,middleeast,True,t3_1cjatl,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1cjatl/meta_a_pair_of_rules_announcements/,

&gt;Dear Mr. Andropov,

&gt;My name is Samantha Smith. I am ten years old. Congratulations on your new job. I have been worrying about Russia and the United States getting into a nuclear war. Are you going to vote to have a war or not? If you aren't please tell me how you are going to help to not have a war. This question you do not have to answer, but I would like to know why you want to conquer the world or at least our country. God made the world for us to live together in peace and not to fight.

&gt;Sincerely,  
Samantha Smith

As you may read from the linked article, the letter was published in a popular Soviet newspaper and, while Andropov did not reply immediately, he did respond with this:

&gt;Dear Samantha,

&gt;I received your letter, which is like many others that have reached me recently from your country and from other countries around the world.

&gt;It seems to me – I can tell by your letter – that you are a courageous and honest girl, resembling Becky, the friend of Tom Sawyer in the famous book of your compatriot Mark Twain. This book is well known and loved in our country by all boys and girls.

&gt;You write that you are anxious about whether there will be a nuclear war between our two countries. And you ask are we doing anything so that war will not break out.

&gt;Your question is the most important of those that every thinking man can pose. I will reply to you seriously and honestly.

&gt;Yes, Samantha, we in the Soviet Union are trying to do everything so that there will not be war on Earth. This is what every Soviet man wants. This is what the great founder of our state, Vladimir Lenin, taught us.

&gt;Soviet people well know what a terrible thing war is. Forty-two years ago, Nazi Germany, which strove for supremacy over the whole world, attacked our country, burned and destroyed many thousands of our towns and villages, killed millions of Soviet men, women and children.

&gt;In that war, which ended with our victory, we were in alliance with the United States: together we fought for the liberation of many people from the Nazi invaders. I hope that you know about this from your history lessons in school. And today we want very much to live in peace, to trade and cooperate with all our neighbors on this earth—with those far away and those near by. And certainly with such a great country as the United States of America.

&gt;In America and in our country there are nuclear weapons—terrible weapons that can kill millions of people in an instant. But we do not want them to be ever used. That's precisely why the Soviet Union solemnly declared throughout the entire world that never—never—will it use nuclear weapons first against any country. In general we propose to discontinue further production of them and to proceed to the abolition of all the stockpiles on Earth.

&gt;It seems to me that this is a sufficient answer to your second question: 'Why do you want to wage war against the whole world or at least the United States?' We want nothing of the kind. No one in our country– neither workers, peasants, writers nor doctors, neither grown-ups nor children, nor members of the government–want either a big or 'little' war.

&gt;We want peace—there is something that we are occupied with: growing wheat, building and inventing, writing books and flying into space. We want peace for ourselves and for all peoples of the planet. For our children and for you, Samantha.

&gt;I invite you, if your parents will let you, to come to our country, the best time being this summer. You will find out about our country, meet with your contemporaries, visit an international children's camp – Artek – on the sea. And see for yourself: in the Soviet Union, everyone is for peace and friendship among peoples.

&gt;Thank you for your letter. I wish you all the best in your young life.

&gt;Y. Andropov

Noting the escalated tensions during that period it was a blessing for the Soviet leader, once cast as a threat to world stability, to declare straight that their main priority is not to wage war but instead to focus on economy. The entire operation played a large part in humanising Soviets and Americans from each side and may have played a part in defusing aforementioned tensions.

There's also something else, if you guys don't mind [a second example](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Wall#The_Fall) also from the 1980s:

&gt;After hearing the [news conference] broadcast [announcing relaxed border control between East and West Germany], East Germans began gathering at the wall and at the six checkpoints between East and West, demanding that border guards immediately open the gates. The surprised and overwhelmed guards made many hectic telephone calls to their superiors about the problem. At first, they were ordered to find the ""more aggressive"" people gathered at the gates and stamp their passports with a special stamp that barred them from returning to East Germany—in effect, revoking their citizenship. However, this still left thousands of people demanding to be let through ""as Schabowski said we can.""

&gt;It soon became clear that no one among the East German authorities would take personal responsibility for issuing orders to use lethal force, so the vastly outnumbered soldiers had no way to hold back the huge crowd of East German citizens. Finally, at 10:45 pm, the guards yielded, opening the checkpoints and allowing people through with little or no identity checking. As the Ossis swarmed through, they were greeted by Wessis waiting with flowers and champagne amid wild rejoicing. Soon afterward, a crowd of West Berliners jumped on top of the wall, and were soon joined by East German youngsters. They danced together to celebrate their new freedom.

This will be identical to the previous list, only I will insist much more strongly on the proper format. This format is:

* *Book title* by Author (date--optional): short, two-to-three sentence description here.

Do not put author name first. Do not give just a list of books. Do not put your descriptions in the first person (no ""I really like this book because..."", rather ""this book is good because..."").Make sure the description is actually descriptive (Don't just write ""this is a great book on early modern France!"" Obviously it is, because this list should consist of *exclusively* really great books, and I am, after all, putting it in the Early Modern France section). In general, more detail is better than less--if someone is planning on reading an entire book on the subject, have faith they can wade through a few sentences on the book.

General/Historiography
------------------------------

**General**

1. *The Human Past* by Chris Scarre (ed.): A very readable, although also very expensive, overview of all of human history from an archaeological perspective. It's very detailed, and used as an introductory book in many universities. Still updated.

2. *How Humans Evolved* by Boyd and Silk: Everything is also discussed by The Human Past, but Boyd and Silk have slightly different opinions and reading both keeps you updated not only on 'how it was' but most importantly what the current debate is and what arguments are used. Also very readable and almost compulsory for everyone into 'evolutionary anything'.

-----------------------------------------------------
Modern
-------------------------------------------------

**General**

1. *The Birth of the Modern World: Global Connections and Comparisons 1780-1914* by C.A. Bayly. The book, written by someone who is not a specialist in Western Europe, shows the myriad ""modernities"" that started emerging in the long 19th century and showing how the Western, eventually dominant one, interacted with them. It also raises the issue of this age as the first true globalization.

2. *Replenishing the Earth: The Settler Revolution and the Rise of the Angloworld 1783-1939* by John Belich. Why is it that British colonialism made the largest impact, in terms of lasting sense of Anglo-connections, whether with America or Australia? In a somewhat controversial book, Belich draws attention both to the economic cycles that made the British Empire the paramount power, and the revolution in settlerism as an ideology that allowed for a wide-ranging cultural expansion.

3. *The Red Flag: A History of Communism* by David Priestland. One of the dominant modern ideologies, communism has often been treated in just its Soviet guise. This book, however, creates a theoretical framework for understanding its different manifestations (dividing it into three large currents - romantic, radical and modernist) and pays close attention to Chinese, Cuban and other communisms, rather than concentrating on Moscow alone.

4. *The Global Cold War: Third World Interventions and the Making of Our Times* by Odd Arne Westad. Tracing the origins of modern Third World interactions with the developed world to the geopolitics of the Cold War, Westad also greatly expands the scope of Cold War history to move beyond Europe. He also takes the ideological clash between the USA, USSR and eventually political Islam more seriously than many scholars.

5. *The age of...* series by Eric Hobsbawm. This series of books (the Age of Revolution, Age of Empire, and Age of Extremes) is one of (and is thought by some to be the best) introduction to modern history. A phenomenally well researched and analysed series of books from the greatest Marxist historian of the last century.


*WWI*

1. See [NMW's incredible list here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1403l7/askhistorians_master_book_list_ii/c78pg65)

2. *The First World War*, by John Keegan (1998): a fine single-volume introduction, and one of the most accessible. Keegan was one of the best popular military historians going, and he was generally believed to be at the height of his game in this particular work. It situates the war in the ""senseless tragedy"" school of cultural memory, but this is hardly a fringe position. Still, very good.

3. *The First World War*, by Hew Strachan (2004): offers a remarkably international view of the conflict, and in a compact single volume at that. This was meant as a companion piece to the (also quite good) television documentary series of the same name which he oversaw. Still, if you want more, look to his much larger The First World War - Vol. I: To Arms (2003) -- the first of a projected three volumes and absolutely staggering in its depth. This first volume alone runs to 1250 pages.

4. *The First World War: A Complete History*, by Martin Gilbert (2nd Ed. 2004): The title is a bit of a lie, but this work from Winston Churchill's official biography is as lucid and sensitive as anything else he's written. Gilbert takes great pains to situate the operations described within the context of their human cost -- not everyone has always found this to be a satisfying tactic when it comes to the critical distance of the scholar, but it's a decision for which good arguments can be made.

*WWII*

1. *The Struggle for Europe* by Chester Wilmot. A detailed account of the European theater during World War II, starting with the allied preparations for D-Day, subsequent invasion of Normandy, and major battles / strategies of the rest of the war.


**Europe/ ""The West""**

1. *Postwar* by Tony Judt - a fantastic in-depth history of Europe after the second world war more-or-less up to the present day by one of the greatest historians of Modern Europe. There are some fantastic insights (like a chapter on the formation of welfare states) as well as a general overview of the period to be found here.

2. *Dark Continent: Europe's 20th Century* by Mark Mazower. Less a comprehensive history of the continent than a piece to explain how ""civilized"" Europe became the bloodiest continent in that century, Mazower brings fascism back into the picture as a really competing opponent to communism and capitalism; and looks at how imperial practices cultivated abroad were copied and applied to Europe itself.

*Eastern Europe*

1. *Magnetic Mountain: Stalinism as Civilization* by Stephen Kotkin. The book takes the building of Magnitogorsk, an industrial city built from scratch, as a way to show how people learned to ""speak Bolshevik"" and thus both survive within and use the regime; thus it complicates hugely the usual top-down view of the Soviet Union.

*Western Europe*

1. *Lourdes: Body and Spirit in the Secular Age* by Ruth Harris. Taking the Lourdes site and the original visions supposedly seen there in 1855, Harris uses this as a microcosm to tell us a lot about emerging civic and patriotic identities in France, raises questions of science versus religion in the age of modernisation, and the question of faith and belief. It is a beautifully written book, and goes far beyond what the title suggests.

2. *A History of Contemporary Italy: Society and Politics, 1943-1988* by Paul Ginsborg. Examines the Italian society from the end of World War II to 1988 with particular emphasis on the transformation of the Italian economy and Italian social structure.

3. *A History of Western Society* by McKay, Hill and others, 2008: A good overview, picks up where The Human Past left off (with an overlap in antiquity) and provides the historical, rather than archaeological, perspective. Very readable, and though it's a textbook and thus most suitable for students (with plenty of 'summaries' and lists of important key words), I'd still recommend it to people who are interested in history without having access to the formal education (and to archaeologists who only study prehistory!).

4. *The Decline and Fall of the British Aristocracy* by David Cannadine. A massive (800 pages) look at everything to do with the downfall of the British aristocracy at the end of the 19th century. I'm not done it yet, but so far it's absolutely engaging.

5. *The French Enlightenment and the Jews: The Origins of Modern Anti-Semitism* by Arthur Hertzberg. This work focuses on the development of modern, secular antisemitism (i.e., antisemitism not based in religious beliefs), examining how ostensibly humanist Enlightenment thinkers could justify the continued exclusion of a group. Fascinating reading, not only for its investigation of Jewish history, but also for examining an aspect of the Enlightenment that doesn't often get to the general public.

6. *The Conquest of Nature: Water, Landscape, and the Making of Modern Germany* by David Blackbourn. An excellent investigation of how industry and society shaped and were shaped by bodies of water in modern Germany. Starts in the 1700s and goes to the twentieth century, with really interesting sections on Frederick the Great, the reshaping of the Rhine, and how Nazi racial and environmental policy intersected.

*Australia*

1. *The Federal Story*, by Alfred Deakin (1900). A behind-the-scenes description of the events and people involved in bringing Australia to federation, written by a man who was at the centre of it all. Deakin wrote this manuscript over a period of years as the events happened. This is history in real time, with no hindsight or after-the-fact analysis.

2. *Alfred Deakin*, by Professor J. A. La Nauze (1965). A biography of Alfred Deakin: a central figure in Australian federation, and later three-time Prime Minister of Australia.

3. *Federation Fathers*, by L. F. Crisp (1990). A collection of essays about various key people involved in the Australian federation movement.

4. *The First Decade of the Australian Commonwealth*, by H. G. Turner (1911). Turner’s personable history of federal politics following federation, describing the people and events that moulded the new country during its first years. His bias against the labour movement and the deluded Labor Party is a bit obvious in places, but it’s sweet.

5. *Australians*, by Thomas Keneally (2009, 2011, ???). This trilogy (which is still being written) is essential reading for anyone interested in Australian history. Keneally, the author responsible for ‘The Chant of Jimmy Blacksmith’ (made into a classic Aussie movie) and ‘Schindler’s Ark’ (filmed as ‘Schindler’s List’), shares the stories of the “little people” in Australia’s past. These are real stories of real people, set in their proper context of Australia’s larger history, and described with a novelist’s style.

*Holocaust*

1. *War &amp; Genocide: A Concise History of the Holocaust* by Doris L. Bergen. A brief, yet comprehensive, and accessible overview of the Holocaust, tracing from the prewar Nazi ascent to power through the end of World War II. Written by one of the best academics currently working on the subject. Includes a good amount of analysis of postwar Holocaust scholarship, too.

2. *The Destruction of the European Jews* by Raul Hilberg. Basically the original work on the Holocaust by the father of Holocaust studies. Originally published in 1961, and revised in 1985, it is available in both an abridged version and as three volumes. Hilberg was a stellar scholar, and while some of it is naturally out of date, it still holds up well today.

3. *Ordinary Men: Reserve Police Battalion 101 and the Final Solution* in Poland by Christopher R. Browning. This focused case study investigates the nature of German killers in the Holocaust, and concludes that the majority, at least in the unit surveyed, were ""ordinary"" guys without any particular ideological commitment to Nazism or antisemitism.


**Africa**

1. The Fate of Africa* by Martin Meredith, 2005. I think this is the best single, readable volume on post-colonial Africa. Entertaining largely because of the ridiculous behavior of many of the characters. It runs 700 pages but it's worth it if you want recent African history.

2. *We Wish to Inform You That Tomorrow We Will Be Killed With Our Families* by Philip Gourevitch, 1999. Probably the best account of the Rwanda genocide of 1994.

3. *Across the Red River* by Christian Jennings, 2001. Another very good look at the Rwanda genocide.
In the Footsteps of Mr. Kurtz: Living on the Brink of Disaster in Mobutu's Congo by Micheala Wrong, 2002. A close look at the rise and fall of Zaire's dictator. Very readable.

**East Asia**

1. *Daily Lives of Civilians in Wartime Asia: From the Taiping Rebellion to the Vietnam War* by Stewart Lone: Fairly straightforward. Not just China but basically every major Asian conflict. It is a behemoth of information that has been collected from far and wide for the reader's convenience. It covers history, provides detailed and cited statistics, and gives insight to culture, art, social chances and upheavals, family and even romantic impact from living during all these wars. An excellent reference.

2. *English in Singapore* by Lisa Lim et al: Discussion of the evolution of the English language in Singapore after independence, related domestic policy, how it affects education, social movements and chances, and even how it affects foreign policy and international standing in economics and business. It also gives a solid history on the developments of Singapore's economy and political system. Awesome read.


*China*

1. *China's Rise in Historical Perspective* edited by Brantly Womack: [fishstickuffs note: If I had to suggest just one book to read from this list this would be it] If anyone is seriously interested in what trends have shaped the current Chinese political landscape, this is the book to read. The perspectives of the contributors are diverse, and so are the topics covered, which include religious cosmology, identity crises in wake of the revolution, ecological issues, and international relations.

2. *Chen Village* by Chan, Madsen and Unger (2nd ed. 2009). This is a beautiful book that traces the life and growth of a village in Southeast China through the entirety of the communist revolution until 2009. Its ambition is incredible, and its execution satisfies its aims. It is effectively an anthropological ethnography written by historians, and the work reflects some of the best of both disciplines. Rarely have I felt as connected to historical characters as I have in learning of the exploits of low-level, unimportant peasant officials in Chen Village. This book communicates the trends in political and social change in China in the last 60 years in a way that is hard to replicate from pure analysis.

3. *Taiwan-China: A Most Ticklish Standoff*- edited by Adam W. Clarke. Besides having the most fantastic name of any academic work on the subject I've seen, this book provides a survey of the triangle of relationships between the US, China and Taiwan through a mixture of excerpts from declassified/public primary sources and academic analysis.

4. *Managing Sino-American Crises: Case Studies and Analysis* edited by Michael Swaine and Zhang Tuosheng. Pretty much THE book on the issue. By far the most extensive analysis of crisis behavior by China and America during Sino-American crises that I know of. Begins with the pos-WWII period, and continues to 2006.

5. *US Taiwan Strait Policy: The Origins of Strategic Ambiguity* by Dean P. Chen This book actually came out this year, and I'm very excited about it. It provides a fantastic summary of the US approach toward China in regards to the Taiwan issue, and is the first major book to do so in regards to the Obama administration's policies. However, certainly not for casual reading. This is an academic analysis of the policy making process, and is making an argument for how to conduct US policy into the future. But in the course of its analysis it provides a fantastic history of the relationship between the US and the Taiwan issue.

6. *Charm Offensive* by Joshua Kurlantzick: An excellent history and analysis of the People's Republic of China's (PRC) international politics, plays in the geopolitical arena, and how foreign policy affects domestic policy as well as vice versa. It is a concise and thorough introduction to the PRC's commitment to the 'soft power' grand strategy, and a must read for any student of the PRC's foreign policy history.

*Korea*

1. *The Koreans: Who They Are, What They Want, Where Their Future Lies* by Michael Breen: This is the primer for all things South Korean history during the 20th century. Starting with the history and effects of the long embedded Japanese occupation, then moving through the Korean War, the rebuilding, the Korean economic development and social &amp; political upheaval, the Seoul Olympics which was instrumental to South Korea's rise to the global stage, and North &amp; South relations through out. A must read.

2. *Nothing to Envy* by Barbara Demick: A heart wrenching piece on the effects of the North Korean regime on the lives of regular North Korean people. It's half based on oral accounts that were taken down by Demick as she interviewed many defectors from the North. The other half is grounded in well researched statistics, diplomatic papers, and economic studies of the North. It is a very compelling read, more focused on telling a narrative of famine, oppression, and strange social constructs than standing as a historical reference but one of the essentials on getting a ground eye view of what life was like in the North.

3. *The North Korean Economy* by Nicholas Eberstadt: Focusing on the economic history of North Korea, this text, in my opinion, is essential to understanding how the North started so strong but is today, practically a failed state. Eberstadt worked tirelessly to check and recheck, then check again all of his numbers because North Korea is notorious for inflating or deflating numbers as they see fit so much that often the records that they present to the outside world cannot be trusted, nor can they be verified. The economics of the North affected every other aspect of life in the North, as well as shaping its political, domestic, and foreign policy because of necessity. The extensive and easily digested statistics, often presented in text and reinforced visually with many graphs, tables and charts, give credence to the analysis of the two Koreas by Eberstadt, starting from the division in 1950 all the way to today.

*Japan*

1. *The Making of Modern Japan* by Marius Jansen: This is the definitive work of modern era Japan. Jansen's work is a chronicle of not just the rise of railroads, of factories, the modern firearm, electricity and gas, the telegraph, milk!, and other interesting developments of early modern Japan. He gives background, history, cultural and political analysis, event and timeline breakdowns and more. An expansive work that takes the reader through decades upon decades of Japanese development and progress that happened at break neck speeds, but can now be looked at retrospectively at our leisure, guided by Jansen's steady hand.

2. *Inventing Japan* by Ian Buruma: I've joked to friends before by calling this ""The Making of Modern Japan Lite"" but this is essentially an extremely succinct look at the changes and developments Japan went through, and its metamorphosis as a nation as it moved from the 19th century into the 20th. This book is seriously tiny, a slip of a book and you could breeze through it in one sitting but its depth of content is surprising for its deceptively small size. I highly recommend this book as a solid introduction, a way to get your foot in the door of the maze that is early modern Japanese history.

3. *Early Japanese Railways 1853-1914: Engineering Triumphs That Transformed Meiji-era Japan* by Dan Free: Surprisingly enough, is not just a book on trains. It is definitely a must read for studies on the Meiji Period and the development going on at the time. It details the massive influx of modern technologies that various Japanese companies were more than happy to incorporate and invest resources into.

**Western Eurasia**

*Prehistory*

1. *The Horse, the Wheel and Language* by David Anthony: A slightly polemic book from 2007 providing his view on the spread of Indo-European language and, in his opinion, culture at the beginning of the Bronze Age. The most current version and most factual (and least political) of the Indo-European debate, for critical readers it's still very valuable because of the large amount of archaeological data that is presented while the polemic writing style makes it accessible to non-specialists as well.

*Mesopotamia*

1. *A History of the Ancient Near East: ca 3000-323 BC*, Marc van der Mieroop: It's an expansive history of the region that at once shows off its scale but also avoids overwhelming with information. It's a must read to acquire a sense of perspective over the region's history.

*Iron Age Europe*

1. *The Celts* by Nora Chadwick: Introduction to Celtic studies. It's an older book (first published in 1970), and focuses on a wide range of Celtic topics including religion (both pre and post Christian), culture, art, and society. It also does a fantastic job of explaining how ""Celtic"" isn't a homogenous entity, but rather many different cultures over a large area over a large period of time.

*Carthage*

1. *Carthage Must Be Destroyed: The Rise and Fall of an Ancient Civilization* by Richard Miles. One of the few general histories of Carthage with a decent detour into syncretism of the Herculean and other cults. Can't fully vouch for the accuracy as this isn't my specialization but it appears well researched with a decent amount of cross reference to the archaeological evidence.

*Classical Greece*

1. *A History of the Greek City-States, 700-338 BC* by Raphael Sealey, whilst the developments of Greek cultures are presented in a narrative fashion the book is arguably more focused on introducing the reader to problems within understanding Greek history. It's therefore a good way to both understand changes in Greek history over time and the reality of interpreting it academically.

2. *A Social and Economic History of the Greek World*, by M. Rostovtzeff, for those interested in ancient economics this book is a must have, and a good introduction into how ancient Greece's economics have been interpreted. It is a little dry, so do not take this as a casual read.

3. *Ancient Greece: From Prehistoric to Hellenistic Times* by Thomas R. Martin. This provides a survey of Greek history focusing mostly on political and military events. Good for those looking for an introduction but also provides fairly in depth analysis of key subjects.


*Rome*

1. *The World of Pompeii* edited by John. J. Dobbins and Pedar W. Foss, a comprehensive collection of papers on every aspect of Pompeii as a city and all written relatively recently. It's very up to date and deals with a lot of aspects of Pompeii's archaeology that don't get much coverage outside of the field itself.

2. *Ancient Rome: A Military and Political History* by Christopher S. Mackay. This is another survey from the ancient world, this one is primarily political and military history. It provides a solid understanding of events, their significance and implications on the Roman state. It covers both empire and republic very efficiently.


*Medieval Europe*

1. The Viking World* by Stefan Brink: A 2008 book which combines many short chapters on any topic relevant to Vikings or the Scandinavian late Iron Age. Strong point is that many chapters are written by the relevant specialists instead of a single author who is trying to specialise in everything. Bad point is that this means that there's not much of a central theme connecting the chapters, which makes this more of a reference work than a bedtime story.

2. *The Discovery of the Individual 1050-1200* by Colin Morris. This is an older work but represents a shift in thought regarding the individual on a personal level. Framed within the context of Western Christianity, Morris looks at the 12th century renaissance as a period of heightened awareneess and self expression.

3. *Britain After Rome* by Robin Fleming. A comprehensive guide to Anglo-Saxon England. Its kinda hard to jump into (it assumes you already know the politics, wars, and events), but does a fantastic job of creating a narrative tale of the Anglo-Saxon people. More of an archeological look than a historical look.

*Early Modern Europe*

1. *Tudor England* by John Guy, a really good introduction to the period with plenty of detailed analysis of the major events that occurred under the Tudor monarchs (Henry VIII-Elizabeth I)

2. *The 16th Century* edited by Patrick Collinson. (Good god, three of the four people I've recommended here have died in the last 3 years). A fantastic collection of essays relating to the Tudors including some really insightful ones on culture, religion, and the fringe areas of the British Isles - great for both dipping in for short chapter-length essays but also for detailed study.

3. *Reformation: Europe's House Divided 1490-1700* By Diarmaid MacCulloch - pretty much the definitive book on the European Reformation, a sweeping, detailed and actually readable account of the European Reformation.

4. *The Elizabethan Puritan Movement* By Patrick Collinson - a bit more specific but the best account of perhaps the most interesting period of religious change in English History by one of its greatest historians, though it is quite a dense book.

5. *Montaillou* by E. Le Roy Ladurie. One of the first and best microhistorical books, this is a highly interesting account of the inquisition of the small village of Montaillou in the 14th century and the insights it can reveal to us.

* France

1. [Night Hawk's fantastic list on France](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1403l7/askhistorians_master_book_list_ii/c78t1q0)

2. *A History of Modern France*, Jeremy Popkin: exactly what it sounds like. It's not one where you can just sit down and read for fun, like these other ones are - it's a textbook, and it's written like one. Very dense and not much verve, but extremely useful in providing context for a lot of these other books and clearing up their ambiguities.

3. *The Village of Cannibals*, Alain Corbin: a ""microhistory"" of a small town in southern France during the Franco-Prussian War, and how the local peasantry reacts to the ousting of Napoleon III. His writing style is a little hard to get used to, but it's an interesting tale of shifting ideas of social class and political thought in a particular setting. Bonus feature: gory murders of French noblemen! (well, one French nobleman, but you can't have everything)

4. *Peasants into Frenchmen: The Modernization of Rural France 1880-1914*, Eugen Weber: a classic if there ever was one. It's easy to get enamored with Paris and the Eiffel Tower and the Belle Epoque when we think of this period, but France has always been tricky: it's much more rural than you think, especially the southern half. Weber does a great job explaining how France was rural and how the Third Republic worked to bring rural France into the fold: peasants into Frenchmen.

5. *Marianne in Chains*, Robert Gildea: how did people actually navigate Vichy France? Gildea's case study of one region in occupied France helps clear the air on this question - like Nemirovsky's work, he's asking about collaboration and resistance, and has some really interesting points to make on historical memory after the war, as well. Not a political history - he references Pétain and Laval on some occasions, but the most political he gets is going into local governments.

6. *Suite Francaise*, Irene Nemirovsky: I throw this book at everyone who asks about Vichy France because it is such a fantastic picture of the choices people had to make during wartime. What is collaboration? What is resistance? Can you be both a collaborator and a resister? It's a thought-provoking historical study and a good novel in its own right. Unfortunately, Nemirovsky died before she had a chance to properly finish it, so what we have is constructed from her drafts and her unfinished notes.


**South Asia**

1. *Forging the Raj, Essays on British India in the Heyday of Empire* by Thomas R Metcalf: Very good book if you want to really look into how the 1857 revolt changed the way Britain acted in India. The book breaks down the essays into sections which include Land Policy,Land tenure architecture and much more. It gives a good view into the different Raj's or mini prince's in India. Lot's of tine going into detail on an an individual one and their life before and after the revolt.

**Africa**

1. *Africa in History* by Basil Davidson, revised ed., 1995. This is a broad survey of African history/prehistory. The first edition is often considered the first culturally neutral attempt to document African history.

2. *The African Slave Trade* by Basil Davidson, revised ed., 1988. As he was an expert in Portuguese colonies, his research and knowledge are particularly strong in that area.

3. *The Strong Brown God* by Sanche de Gramont, 1991. The history of early European attempts to reach Timbuktu and to map the entire Niger River in the 19th century. It's a highly entertaining read; I strongly recommend it to all audiences.

**East Asia**

*China*

1. *Cambridge Illustrated History of China* by Patricia Buckley Ebrey (2nd ed. 2010). Fantastic general survey of Chinese history, and a standard in college courses. I put this under the ""Imperial"" section because there are better resources dealing strictly with modern China.

2. *Chinese Civilzation: A Sourcebook* edited by Patricia Buckley Ebrey. Another standard find in intro Chinese history courses in college. This is a great introduction to

3. *Soldiers of the Dragon* edited by CJ Peers. Osprey publishers have a wide variety of awesome military histories. You wouldn't be likely to find this in a college classroom, but that can be a plus. It's not a hard read, but extremely informative.

4. *This Is China: The First 5,000 Years* by Haiwang Yuan: This should be the standard text in every introductory class to Chinese history. It is an incredibly short, brief book that is a crash course on Chinese history to the uninitiated as well as a solid quick reference for the more experienced. It is a work that runs over the surface of almost everything Chinese history has to offer and dips its head under the water at select places to try to give the reader a real taste of what lies before them. More than cover Chinese history, it is a great book to illustrate the fact that trying to understand all of Chinese history at once is impossible and is as much art and dynamic dialogue as it is inexact science and lively academia. Another must have.

5. *The Archaeology of China: From the Late Paleolithic to the Early Bronze Age* by Li Liu and Xingcan Chen: Only recently having finished reading this myself, I highly recommend this book for its compelling points about, well everything. It sheds light on topics ranging from the structures of societies, agriculture, tools and warfare, regional and inter-cultural influences on development, to even diet and health. Most of the research comes from archaeological studies as well as interpreting inscriptions, artifacts, and other reputable academic sources.

6. *Chinese Ceramics: From the Paleolithic Period through the Qing Dynasty* by Laurie Barnes et al: This incredible work not only talks about porcelain and other Chinese pottery, which are all exquisite, but also its impact on culture, life, trade, and politics. It is an extremely good book for general Chinese history as well as an in depth look at Chinese art over the centuries, which relates heavily to Chinese cultural, philosophical and religious thought, all through the lens of pottery.

7. *Daily Life in Traditional China: The Tang Dynasty* by Charles Benn: Extremely accessible book that is based completely on secondary sources and cites other reference books. It is a very handy introductory primer to what life generally was like for the average Chinese person. While obviously focused on the Tang Dynasty, it is a solid place for a start as serious readers/history buffs can build off of this solid foundation as they research more on their own. It is a very light read compared to the more academic texts that I usually recommend but personally this one of my favorites.

*Japan*

1. *The Samurai Sourcebook* by Stephen Turnbull (and any other book by Turnbull for that matter): An extremely detailed and thorough, yet highly readable, work on all that is samurai, the warrior class that shaped Japan. It covers everything anyone ever wanted to know about samurai, from daily life during piece, life during war, equipment, pay, rank, military organization, politics, to things like diet, music and art, high culture &amp; low culture. This is the samurai book.

2. *The Economic Aspects of the History of the Civilization of Japan* by Takekoshi Yosaburou: Exhaustive in its breadth and scope, it covers the economics of Japan throughout the centuries. A monstrous book filled with more numbers, names, places, and dates than one could ever hope to find in one consolidated text, this is everything you ever wanted to know about Japanese money, economics, and value and more. I recently went back to this monster of a book to fulfill a request to find out what the koku(measure of wealth) value of all the individual Japanese provinces were. Sure enough, it was only a matter of picking out the relevant statistics and information, compiling and a short outing with the calculator and BAM. Incredible resource for the impact of money on salaries, prices, access to goods by various people of society, etc. Simply amazing.

**The Americas**

*Mesoamerica*

1. *Codex Chimalpopoca* by John Bierhorst (1998): This text actually contains two sources, the Annals of Cuauhtitlan and The Legend of the Suns. Readers unfamiliar with religious features of Mesoamerica may find this book a little confounding, however it does have a notable place in academic understandings of precolumbian faiths. Bierhorst was also kind enough to include the original Nahuatl which is useful for students of the language.

*North America*

1. *Archaeology of the Southwest* by Linda Cordell and Maxine McBrinn (Third Edition is from 2012): A comprehensive look by two of the most respected names in the field.

2. *The Chaco Meridian* by Stephen Lekson (1999): One of the most interesting and innovative books about the area, by one of its most famous scholars -- he posits a unified theory of the Pueblo world centred on Chaco Canyon.

3. *Archaeology Without Borders: Contact, Commerce, and Change in the U.S. Southwest and Northwestern Mexico* (Southwest Symposium Series) ed. by Maxine McBrinn and Laurie Webster (2008): A collection of papers about the connections between the US Southwestern Pueblo period and Mesoamerica.

---------------------------------------------
Cultural/Intellectual/Religious Studies
------------------------------------------

**Religion**

*Christianity*

1. *Border Lines: The Partition of Judaeo-Christianity* by Daniel Boyarin (2004): although it has serious problems of readability if you do not know enough about the period, Boyarin's work is easily the most revolutionary thesis about the 'parting of the ways'--between Judaism and Christianity--to come out in recent memory. He argues that, in fact, neither Judaism nor Christianity existed before they constructed each other. See also Judith Lieu's Neither Jew nor Greek (2004).

2. *The Parting of the Ways: between Christianity and Judaism and their significance for the character of Christianity* by James D. G. Dunn (1991; 2nd. ed. 2005): a thorough survey of the status of Judaism at the time of Jesus, and how Christianity slowly positioned itself as 'not Jewish.' A readable classic in the field.

3. *The Quest of the Historical Jesus: a critical study of its progress from Reimarus to Wrede* by Albert Schweitzer (1905, German original): although weighed down by over-faithful English translations, Schweitzer's book is literally the beginning of all contemporary attempts to understand Jesus in a non-theological light, to the point that the historiography of historical Jesus research in split into 'quests', the first of which begins with Reimarus and ends with Wrede (and Schweitzer). This book is essentially a historiography of the Jesus question, and introduced one of the most enduring questions in Jesus research: was Jesus eschatologically minded?

4. *The Five Gospels: What Did Jesus Really Say? The Search for the authentic sayings of Jesus* by the Robert Funk, Roy Hoover, and the Jesus Seminar (1993): This is effectively the result of a panel of experts, assembled by Funk, to determine the 'authentic' teachings of Jesus by voting on each one with coloured beads. This book contains both their own translation (the ""Scholar's Translation"") of the four canonical gospels and the Gospel of Thomas, coloured sayings of Jesus, and a guide to their methodology. Incredibly controversial, both within and without the field, the Jesus Seminar's work is best appreciated when compared to the work of others in the ""Third Quest.""

5. *A brief introduction to the New Testament* by Bart D. Ehrman (2004): a very good introduction to the methods and contexts of New Testament studies, going book-by-book. Written at the level of an interested undergraduate student.

*Chinese*

1. *Death Ritual in Late Imperial and Modern China*- Edited by James Watson and Evelyn S. Rawski. A rigorously researched academic treatment of its subject based on both ethnographic fieldwork and collection of primary resources.

2. *Three Ways of Thought in Ancient China*- by Arthur Waley (1939). This book has been criticized and expanded upon with the increased study of the intellectual history of China, and suffers from the traditional failure of historians to take Chinese lay-religion into account when evaluating the broader intellectual trends in China. Nevertheless, it is an excellent introduction to Chinese religious and philosophical thought.

3. *Religion in China Today* edited by Daniel L. Overmyer. A wonderfully informative collection of articles on the resurgence of Chinese religion under communist rule. Academic in nature, but not a terribly difficult read. Anyone interested in how China has attemped (and failed) to repress religious practices in the last 60 years should read this book.

This question and similar others emerged last night when my brother and I had a little debate about this topic and some others regarding national identity. It is my impression that there is people in the Spanish-speaking world that seem to have an issue with this and consider that US citizens have somehow co-opted this term out of some feeling of superiority. Although this feelings might or might not be part of the American present or past identity, the fact is that US citizens simply call themselves Americans because there is no other name for that in English. Our little discussion was not about the present but about the past and origin of this usage of the word ""American"". However we found ourselves somewhat lacking the historical references to properly discuss this topic. That is why I came here to ask.

In order to further illustrate the nature of our little midnight debate I will throw out some more questions. I am not really asking for a list of anwers matching this list of questions, I just want to know more about the topic.

- When did the term ""American"" become the denonym of citizens in the United States?
- Did the inhabitants of the English colonies called themselves Americans?
- If they did, did this term coexisted with other terms like ""colonist"" or any other? Were this terms equally popular?
- Did citizens in some other  North American colonies like Quebec called themselves ""Americans""?
- If they did, how and when did the term started to clearly differentiate US citizens from, for example, Canadian or Mexican ones? In other words, when did it started to refer exclusively to US citizens?
- How is this identity linked to American Revolutionary War and Independence? Did authorities such as politicans or the ""Founding Fathers"" encourage the use of the word ""American""? Did they discouraged other terms or denominations?

I understand this questions may be too broad or difficult to answer but I hope that the wonderful redditors that post in r/askhistorians could add some insight to our ignorance. Thanks!

Allow me to explain: 

My grandfather was sixteen when he enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1943. Needless to say, he lied in order to do so. For some reason, he really wanted to be an Airborne Ranger. And that he was. 

Upon completing his training, he was assigned as a medic to the 17th Airborne Division. Less than a year later, his division was deployed. At the ripe age of 17, he found himself parachuting into gunfire . 

""We were tough. Not so tough as trees, the trees that broke our backs and made us easy targets, but we were tougher than the bones in our knees when we landed. I remember we went into the barn after the shooting stopped and we had to shoot the cows. The grenades, too many grenades, you see, they threw pieces of wood at them, at the cows in the barn. They were on the ground, in their hay and their shit, screaming like cows don't scream with splinters bigger than ribs in their ribs. So we shot them good in the head, the poor things. After, we went outside and walked around to see what we could keep. I heard a soldier. He was moaning. When I found him, he was holding his arm and I knew it was bad. He took one in his right. Went clean through. Hit him in the face. His eye was hanging down on his cheek. Didn't want to go the way of the rest of them. Had to cut it clean, but his arm was bleeding dry. And that's bad. When I tried to wrap him up, he screamed, 'Mein auge!' And he fought. I didn't know what he was saying, but I said, 'I know. I know.' I grabbed his arm. I wrapped it good. He screamed, 'Mein auge!' I thought maybe he was calling for his nana, so I told him he'd be good as new if only he stopped screaming, and cut that wire on his eye. He screamed again, 'Mein auge!' And he poked his other eye and out it came. A glass eye sitting in his lap, his other sitting in the dirt. I told myself only God would put me here to help a blind man be more blind, German or not. So I don't like Him. He never did any good by me in that war. And if that German can't see me, then I can't see Him anymore. Not like I used to.""

It seems equally ruthless to separate them from their parents as it does to separate them from their country, and I'm astounded that so many people would willingly place their children between that rock and that hard place. end of edit

Specifically, I'm asking about long-term spies who would assume a new identity living as a Westerner in the West.  Because I am an American, experts or people knowledgeable on Soviet spies in the U.S. are especially but not exclusively welcome.

I feel ok in assuming that ordinary people across the world are generally well-meaning and nice, or at the very least uninterested in malice. I assume, then, that the people these spies interacted with in their daily activities; e.g. their coworkers, friends, maybe even their children; revealed themselves to be people just like them.

This part is certainly a little ethnocentrist, but I doubt I'm alone in thinking that life in the West was better than life in the U.S.S.R, and I understand the difficulties and problems that come with attempting to analyze the psychology of a *particular* historical figure, let alone an entire class of them, but what motivation would these presumably very intelligent, very educated, and very adept at seeming Western people have had not to simply join the enemy, so to speak?

I understand that it need not have been hatred for the people they had gotten to know in the West; it's possible that they might have been trying only to keep the balance of power and information even so as not to allow their government to fall.

I'm hoping the answer is more interesting than the threat of death for turning their coats.

As I understand it, the Roman Catholic Church forbade dissections, disliked doctors with medical knowledge or innovative ideas about health as a threat to their authority, and instead encouraging a focus on prayer. 

My teachers also told us that though much Greek and Roman medical knowledge was lost in Western Europe, some such as Galen remained and was held as the ultimate truth of human anatomy. From a textbook: ""although students did debate the ideas of Galen, any new ideas were judged on the debating skills of the student, not on scientific proof. The Church said that Galen's ideas were so correct that there was no need to investigate any further"". Chaucer also mentions his Doctor was ""well-versed in Aesculpaius too | And what Hippocrates and Rufus knew |
And Disocorides now dead and gone, | Galen and Rhazes, Hali, Serapion"". It seems that Classical medical thinkers were held in the greatest esteem in the Middle Ages.

From this, I have a few questions:

1. Why was the Church more accepting of sources from Greece and Rome (presumably more fallible than contemporary Christian doctors)?
2. Did this attitude apply across the arts, sciences and philosophy?
3. If the Church saw the Greeks and Romans as the pinnacle of human achievement and knowledge, did they consider later times to be in a downward decline?
4. What, if any, influence to the Arabic world have on Medieval understanding of science and human progress through their contact with the Middle East during the Crusades?

I hope these questions make sense and I apologise if I've used some terms incorrectly. Also, I read that people in the Middle Ages had a much more elastic view of history, and frequently conceptualised Biblical events as happening within their own geosocial context (Benedict Anderson, *Imagined Communities*).

Ok, all joking aside, I would like to remind everyone of the homework rule.

We will *help* you, but we won't do it *for* you.

It's pretty obvious to us who have been here a while what are and are not the homework questions, things like ""What were the strengths and weaknesses of the Magna Carta"", ""What role did Thomas a'Becket play in the dispute of Church and State in early Medieval England?""  Those questions usually won't get any answers because it's obvious you are fishing for an answer.

However if you tell us that it's a homework question up front, we will gladly help steer you to the right answers or at least get you started.  We will give you resources to your answers, help you narrow down your essays, and even proofread your homework.  We just won't do all the work for you.

I am [Alex Wellerstein](http://nuclearsecrecy.com/blog/about-me/). I have a PhD in the History of Science from Harvard University, where I focused on the history of biology and the history of physics. My all-consuming research for the last decade or so has been on the **history of nuclear weapons.** I wrote my dissertation on the history of nuclear secrecy in the United States, 1939-2008, and am currently in the final stages of turning that into a book to be published by the University of Chicago Press. I am presently employed by the Center for the History of Physics at the American Institute of Physics in College Park, Maryland, near Washington, DC. 

I am best known on the Internets for writing [Restricted Data: The Nuclear Secrecy Blog](http://nuclearsecrecy.com/blog/), which has shared such gems as the fact that [beer will survive the nuclear apocalypse](http://nuclearsecrecy.com/blog/2012/09/05/beer-and-the-apocalypse/), [the bomb doesn't sound like what you think it does](http://nuclearsecrecy.com/blog/2012/07/13/the-sound-of-the-bomb-1953/), and [plenty of other things](http://nuclearsecrecy.com/blog/archives/). 

I also am the creator of the NUKEMAP, a mashup nuclear weapons effects simulator, and have just this past week launched [NUKEMAP2](http://nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap/), which added much more sophisticated effects codes, fallout mapping, and casualty estimates (!!) for the first time, and [NUKEMAP3D](http://nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap3d/), which allows you to visualize nuclear explosions using the Google Earth API. The popularity of both of these over the past week blew up my server, my hosting company dropped me, and I had to move everything over to a new server. So if you have trouble with the above links, I apologize! It should be working for everyone as of today but the accessibility world-wide has been somewhat hit-and-miss (DNS propagation is slow, blah). 

So please, **Ask Me Anything about the history of nuclear weapons!** My deepest knowledge is of American developments for the period of 1939 through the 1970s, but if you have an itch that gets out of that, shoot it my way and I'll do my best (and always try to indicate the ends of my knowledge). Please also do not feel that you have to ask super sophisticated or brand-new questions — I like answering basic things and ""standard"" questions, and always try to give them my own spin. 

Please keep in mind this is a history sub, so I will try to keep everything I answer with in the realm of the past (not the present, not the future). 

I'll be checking in for most of the day, so feel free to ask away!

However lately, I have been having to clear out the filter for the most innocuous of comments.  I actually had a comment flagged because they were asking for the dimensions of a sword.  *The dimensions of a sword!*  Why was that flagged?  

The other comments flagged were about religious questions.  Let me make this perfectly clear.  **THIS SUB IS NOT HERE TO CONFIRM YOUR BIASES**  That has been on the sidebar for months now.  Now, most of the contributors here have the sensibilities to realize that a discussion of sensitive topics are touchy, and treat it as such.  If you want to mock, defame, or complain about religion, go to another sub.  We discuss religion, sexuality, and other complex issues in an academic sense here.  If someone favoring Christianity, Ronald Regan, or Hitlers ability to design cool uniforms makes a comment, don't flag it, I will unflag it and move on.  Why?  Because flagging it *does nothing*.

When you flag a comment, it does not hide it from everyone, just you.  You are honestly wasting the moderators time clearing out the filter for flagging comments like [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/tawl9/when_was_homosexuality_first_restrained_and/c4l4569).  Why was this flagged?  Was it an accident?  Did it offend your preconceived notions of the world?  Tough.  History studied in depth is to study the world, warts and all.  

This sub will make you uncomfortable about your world view, your beliefs, and your ideas.  If you can't hack it, go look at cats.

Quit flagging things that are not spam, or deliberate antagonism by users.

**Today:**

The ""Monday Mysteries"" series will be focused on, well, mysteries -- historical matters that present us with problems of some sort, and not just the usual ones that plague historiography as it is. Situations in which our whole understanding of them would turn on a (so far) unknown variable, like the sinking of the Lusitania; situations in which we only know that something did happen, but not necessarily how or why, like the deaths of Richard III's nephews in the Tower of London; situations in which something has become lost, or become found, or turned out never to have been at all -- like the art of Greek fire, or the Antikythera mechanism, or the historical Coriolanus, respectively.

**This week, we're going to be discussing examples of historical conspiracies for which we do, in fact, have compelling evidence.**

Not everything that happens does so for the reasons that appear on the surface.  This is simply true; a great deal of work often goes into concealing the real motives and actors behind things that occur, and it is sometimes the case that, should these motives and actors become widely known, the consequences would be very significant indeed.  There are hands in the darkness, men (and women) behind the throne, powers within powers and shadows upon shadows.

What are some examples from throughout history of conspiracies that have actually taken place?  Who were the conspirators?  What were their motives?  Did they succeed?  What are the implications of their success or failure -- and of us actually knowing about it?

Feel free to discuss any sort of conspiracy you like, whether it political, cultural, artistic, military -- even academic.  Entirely hypothetical bonus points will be awarded to those who can provide examples of historiographical conspiracies.

Moderation will be light, as usual, but please ensure that your answers are polite, substantial, and posted in good faith!

**Next week on Monday Mysteries: Get ready to look back -- way back -- and examine the likely historical foundations of popular myths and legends.**",Feature,False,,t5_2ssp3,False,feature,military,True,t3_1j9zv8,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1j9zv8/monday_mysteries_verifiable_historical/,moderator

1372029684.0,448,self.AskHistorians,1gxnvf,[META] I'd like to seriously request that the r/History AMAS stop being advertised in r/AskHistorians,638,190,125,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1gxnvf/meta_id_like_to_seriously_request_that_the/,"First, it's true that I am not a flaired user and could never hope to be.  I am interested as an amateur in things like ancient Rome and World War Two and the crusades, but I have no real training in those areas and don't feel I could contribute even a tenth as well as the users in this sub do already.  I'm just another unflaired user reading along.

That being said, I like to think I know quality when I see it, and the events of the last few days have shown that I'm not alone in my opinion on this subject.

In the last few weeks, r/History has been having a series of AMAS from popular history podcasters.  Some of them have been pretty okay, but none of them have been up to the amazing standards that this sub has set for itself and it hurts to see them promoted.  This has been especially frustrating with two of them in particular.

- Mike Duncan of the History of Rome podcast [did one here](http://np.reddit.com/r/history/comments/1fff0g/hello_i_am_mike_duncan_creator_of_the_history_of/).  Rather than repeat my complaints, [check them out here](http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/1fh62j/rhistorys_users_are_really_defensive_about_their/).

- Ray Harris, of the History of World War II podcast, [did one here](http://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/1gntgm/i_am_ray_harris_creator_of_the_history_of_war_war/).  It was even worse; by any standard it was awful.  This was like getting a guy who wasn't even smart enough to consult wikipedia properly to do an AMA.  I've laid out some specific complaints [about it here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1gsat2/friday_freeforall_june_21_2013/canf8sd?context=1), in response to r/History's top mod's defending it, but I was not alone.  There were several flaired users in r/AskHistorians who complained about it [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1gsat2/friday_freeforall_june_21_2013/cancws3), and on [the day of the AMA here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1gnu3s/ray_harris_creator_of_the_history_of_world_war_ii/), and who contributed really welcome challenges to the podcaster in his own thread too.  Just scroll down and look for rusoved, prufrock451, renoXD, and there may be more too.  To put it bluntly, this podcaster spent the whole day providing absolute shit in response to really simple questions, and there's not a single thing he posted in there that anyone should respect.  Please go take a look and see for yourself.

I know that these two subreddits need to get along because that have so much overlapping community and interests, but the thing I love most about r/AskHistorians is the high standards it sets for everything that appears here.  Promoting this sort of thing seems to go against that, and I am offering a formal complaint.

I hope it's okay to make a thread like this.  I searched up past METAS and it seemed like it would be, but I can delete it if not.

Edit edit: I had earlier said I thought I was banned from r/History for this post, but the ban actually came in a few minutes before I made it and I just hadn't noticed.  It seems instead to have been because of [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1gwlcq/day_of_reflection_june_17th23rd/caot8xf), based on the time stamps, but no actual reason was given to me so I don't 100% know.

Edit edit edit: As of earlier this afternoon the ban has been lifted, so that part of it at least seems to have been resolved.  Thank you everyone who asked about this and protested.

We have seen a recent amount of sizable growth in the past few months with our repeated posting to /r/bestof and winning ""Best Large Sub"" from truebestof 2012.  We are flattered and excited by this growth, but at the same time have seen some growing pains occurring, so we wanted to go ahead and address them.


Lately we have seen quite a few rules debates occurring around here.  They have gotten so bad that they ended up exceeding the actual number of posts that actually addressed the issue.  Its fine that you want to debate the rules, however, if you feel passionately enough about them, contact the moderators and ask for a clarification, or ask to take them to a meta thread.  We are here to answer questions, not bog down a thread with debates over the definition of ""is.""

Now, let me go ahead and clarify a few thing outright.

1. ) **The rules are the absolute bare minimum that must be met**.

Most top tier posts fit these guidelines.  However we have seen quite a few mediocre posts (using those terms loosely).  We prefer that you exceed the rules.

2.)  **Copy pasta of an article is lazy posting and spammy**

Someone the other day simply copy and pasted the text of a wiki article as their entire post.  Firstly, always assume that the OP has read the bare minimum of information to include Wikipedia.  You can quote it in your answer, but as your only answer, its just spammy and lazy.  This leads me to...

3.)  **Simply throwing a link up is also a bit lazy** 

If you are linking to a web site or another /r/askhistorians thread that already answered this question, please give a ""TL;DR"" for the links.  

4.)  **Don't post just to ""save for later""  There is a save link feature to reddit.**

Please use it.  You are just spamming up the thread.

5.)  **If you can't answer now, don't answer**

If you do not have to the time to answer, don't throw up a ""I know the answer, but I can't answer now.""  Just wait until you can answer please.  It's not a race to karma, and even though your answer may not end up at the top, you can still use it later to get your flair if that is what you are after.

6.)  **If your answer begins with ""I'm guessing"" or ""I don't know, but I think.."" or god forbid, ""I was told by a guy I once knew"" just don't post.**

If you are not **100,000% sure** of your answer, just don't bother.  It spams up the thread.  This isn't a test you are taking, and its not a contest to answer.  I myself have stopped halfway through more posts than I have finished here because I wasn't 100% sure of my answer.  Quit guessing, you aren't being graded.

7.)  **Source PLEASE if asked, especially if you are not flaired**

If you are being asked for a source, it completely behooves you to find *something* to back up your claims, especially if you are not a flaired user.  Flaired users have shown that they are reliable and are able to substantiate their claims.  Non-flaired users should really substantiate their claims with a source.  No, it doesn't need to be a citation down to the page, but something should be available if you are asked.  You probably aren't the only person to read that book, so it allows people to check your work.

8.)  **In any debate, the mods pretty much are the final word**

Unlike many other subs, the moderator team here are actual experts in their fields varying from college professors to grad students to published writers to highly read amateurs.  We also spend much of the day debating back and forth about new policies, new rules, and the way controversial posts are handled.  Very little is done arbitrarily by ""power tripping mods"" outside of elimination of posts that blatantly violate the rules.  When a mod says the post is not good enough and deletes it and you want to object, take it to mod mail.  When a mod asks for a source, they are doing so for a reason, just give sources.  If you have any problems send it to mod mail, do not spam up a thread with your Braveheart style ""FREEEDOM TO POST!!!!"" speech.

And before you ask, yes, mods here have changed their minds about things after they have been clarified.

9.)  **""UPVOTED FOR AWESOME!""  ""You rock!"" etc. are spam.  Stop it**

'Nuff said.  Let your upvotes speak.

10.)  **Two sentences does not an answer make.  If you are going to answer the question, give an in depth quality answer.**

If your answer is something like this exchange, Q: ""What did pirates really sound like?"" A: ""Pirates came from like all over and they really wouldn't have sounded like you think they do.""  Then you have given a bad answer.  You need to explain yourself, clarify things, show why.  Anyone can write a two sentence answer, someone who actually cares writes a paragraph.

11.)  **Actually answer the question.  Quit trying to redefine the question for them and obfuscate that you don't actually know the answer.  Just bloody answer it.**

Lately, I have seen a lot of hand waving that doesn't actually answer the question.  For example, I myself asked the other day ""How many members of a Roman Legion were from the upper classes?""  The response I got was telling me all about how you had to be a leader in the legions to gain high office.  Yes, thats nice and all, but it doesn't answer the question.  If someone asks, ""Why did Hitler have a mustache?"" don't answer with a bunch of half thought statements about the history of facial hair, answer that specific question.  

12.)  **Stop with the non-sequitors.  Only post something that is relevant.**

Similar to #11.  If OP asks about the history of Islam in the Philippines, don't say something like, ""Bangladesh is Muslim too!""  It's irrelevant and makes you sound like Ralph Wiggum.

/u/bemonk:

Fell in love with the history of alchemy while a tour guide in Prague and has been reading up on it ever since. I do the [History of Alchemy Podcast](http://historyofalchemy.com/podcast.html) ([backup link](https://itunes.apple.com/cz/podcast/history-of-alchemy-podcast/id601738089?mt=2) in case of traffic issues). I don't make anything off of this, it's just a way to share what I read. I studied Business along with German literature and history.

/u/Bemonk can speak to

* neo-platonism, hermeticism, astrology and how they tie into alchemy

* Alchemy's influence on actual science

/u/MRMagicAlchemy

First introduced to Carl Jung's interpretation of alchemy as a freshman English major. His interest in the subject rapidly expanded to include both natural magic and alchemy from the Middle Ages and the Renaissance to the 19th-century occult revival. Having spent most of his career as an undergraduate studying ""the occult"" when he should have been reading Chaucer, he decided to pursue a M.S. in History of Science and Technology.

His main interest is the use of analogy in the correspondence systems of Medieval and Renaissance natural magic and alchemy, particularly the Hermetic Tradition of the Early Renaissance. 

/u/MRMagicAlchemy can speak to

* 19th century revival

* Carl Jung's interpretation of alchemy

* Chaos Magic movement of the late 20th Century - sigilization

**We can both speak to alchemical ideas in general**, like: 

* philospher's stone/elixir of life, transmutation, why they thought base metals can be turned into gold. Methods and equipment used. 

* Other occult systems that tie into alchemy: numerology, theurgy/thaumatargy, natural magic, etc.

* ""Medical alchemy""

* **facepoundr**: 
I studied Russian history and more specifically Soviet Union history from high school to university. I received my Bachelor's in History from one of the best public schools in my state. I did my honor's thesis concerning Khrushchev's visit to Iowa in 1959. I've also done research into the Gulag system, WW2 (The Great Patriotic War), Napoleon's Invasion of Russia, and probably too much about grain. I am currently reading more Russian Literature and would like to continue my education and receive a graduate degree. Furthermore currently I am employed as non-academic staff at Cornell University. 

* **Fandorin**
I've primarily focused on Russian history between 1700 and 1917, with particular attention to language and culture. Recently, my interest has shifted to the Soviet period, particularly the development of the Soviet Army during WW2, from the strategic and tactical failures at the outset of the war, to the development of the Soviet Army that was able to successfully conduct theater-wide operations against the Wehrmacht. I'm a native Russian speaker.

* **TenMinuteHistory**
I am a graduate student studying Soviet history. The focus of my research is Soviet culture. I received my masters in World history (with a thesis focusing on Soviet Film), and am now working on my Phd in Soviet history. My time period of greatest interested is the Revolution itself, really up until World War II. A great deal of good work is currently being done on the post war era currently and I foresee myself doing a project in that era down the road

* **occupykony**
Soviet Russia

* **MYGODWHATHAVEIDONE**
I worked for two years at a bipartisan foreign policy think tank as the research assistant to a former U.S. National Security Adviser who served during the Cold War. My Ph.D. studies have included a course on Soviet foreign policy taught by a long time member of the intelligence community who was working in the DNI during the Bush administration, a course on the Eastern Bloc taught by an advisor to the Policy Planning staff at the Department of state, and a course on modern Chinese history (which necessarily covers its relationship with Russia/USSR) taught by the former State Department historian for China. I have done a significant amount of graduate work on my own on geopolitics and nuclear weapons, both of which focus centrally on the foreign policy and international relations of Russia/USSR.

Later, another lady asks the player (in the guise of the ruggedly handsome Booker DeWitt) for the time in a rather lewd tone.

So, my question is this:  Was asking for the time ever used as code for a sexual hookup?

In part of the movie, Albert ""confesses"" that he was abused and neglected in his early childhood. It's insinuated in the movie that this is the cause of his stutter. The [Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_King's_Speech) talks about the inaccuracies of the movie but doesn't mention anything about this portion of the movie.

Was that true? Was Albert really abused by his nanny? That his father was difficult (to put it mildly, according to the movie) and that he wasn't close to his parents isn't particularly surprising because of the time period. Were the depictions of his life accurate or was it more dramatic license on the filmmakers' part?

(And yes, I finally got around to watching a 3 year old movie. One of these days I'll get to Saving Private Ryan too.)

I have been trying for some time to figure out why this is so.

Not just Ancient Egypt, the panel has been specifically gathered so that we might conceivably answer questions about Egypt in any period of history and some parts of prehistory.

Egpyt has a long history, almost unimaginably so at some points. Egypt is a fairly regular topic in the subreddit, and as you can see from our assembled panelists we have quite a number of flaired users able to talk about its history. This is an opportunity for an inundation of questions relating to Egypt, and also for panelists to sit as mighty pharaohs broadcasting their knowledge far across the land. 

With that rather pointless pun aside, here are our eight panelists:

* **Ambarenya** will be answering questions about *Byzantine Egypt*, and also Egypt in the *Crusader era*.

* **Ankhx100** will be answering questions about Egypt from *1800 AD* onwards, and also has an interest in *Ottoman, Medieval, Roman* and *Byzantine Egypt*.

* **Daeres** will be answering questions about *Ptolemaic Egypt*, in particular regarding state structures and cultural impact.

* **Leocadia** will be answering questions about *New Kingdom Egypt*, particularly about religion, literature and the role of women.

* **Lucaslavia** will be answering questions about *New Kingdom Egypt* and the *Third Intermediate Period*, and also has an interest in *Old Kingdom* and *Pre-Dynastic Egypt*. A particular specialist regarding Ancient Egyptian Literature.

* **Nebkheperure** will be answering questions about *Pharaonic Egypt*, particularly pre-Greek. Also a specialist in hieroglyphics.

* **Riskbreaker2987** will be answering questions regarding Late *Byzantine Egypt* all the way up to *Crusader era Egypt*, including *Islamic Egypt* and *Fatimid Egypt*.

* **The3manhimself** will be answering questions regarding *New Kingdom Egypt*, in particular the *18th dynasty* which includes the Amarna period.

In addition to these named specialties, all of the panelists have a good coverage of Egypt's history across different periods.

The panelists are in different timezones, but we're starting the AMA at a time in which many will be able to start responding quickly and the AMA will also be extending into tomorrow (31st January) in case there are any questions that didn't get answered.

This isn't an attempt, of course, to justify the horrific behavior of the Europeans, but I'm wondering whether that might be an indication that Native Americans did have notions of ownership in their culture as well.

- The Mongols believed that religion was tied to your birthplace and saw no reason why someone from one area would need to believe the same thing as someone from another. 

-The Mongols benefitted from religious refugees from other places, accepting in intelligent, trained persecuted individuals from all faiths. 

-The Mongols themselves were very diverse religiously and so therefore they were tolerant and accepting of each other so why wouldn't they be tolerant and accepting of the people in their empire. 

-The Mongols believed that any religion could potentially be correct, so by stipulating that the faithful pray for blessings on the Khan of Khans, they would be protected and blessed from any of them if that particular religion was correct.

**We will, however, not be talking about the Holocaust today.** Lately and in the popular imagination, Jewish History has tended to become synonymous with Holocaust studies. In this AMA we will focus on the thousands of years of Jewish history that do *not* involve Nazis. For the sorely disappointed: there will be a Holocaust AMA in the near future.

Anyone interested in delving further into the topic of Jewish History may want to peruse the massive list of threads on the subject compiled by /u/thefuc which [can be found in our wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/jewishthreads).

Our panelists introduce themselves to you:

* **otakuman**	Biblical &amp; Ancient Near East Archaeology

    I've studied the Bible for a few years from a Catholic perspective. Lately I've taken a deep interest in Ancient Israel from an archaeological viewpoint, from its beginnings to the Babylonian exile.

    My main interest is about the origins of the Old Testament : who wrote it, when, and why; how the biblical narrative compares with archaeological data; and the parallels between judaism and the texts of neighboring cultures.

* **the3manhimself** 	ANE Philology | New Kingdom Egypt | Hebrew Bible 

    I studied Hebrew Bible under well-known biblical translator Everett Fox. I focus on philology, archaeology, textual origins and the origins of the monarchy. I wrote my thesis on David as a mythical progenitor of a dynastic line to legitimize the monarchy. I also wrote research papers on Egyptian cultural influence on the Hebrew Bible and the Exodus. I'm competent in Biblical Hebrew and Middle Egyptian and I've spent time digging at the Israelite/Egyptian site of Megiddo. My focus is on the Late Bronze, Early Iron Age and I'm basically useless after the Babylonian Exile.

* **yodatsracist** 	Comparative Religion

    I did a variety of studying when I thought, as an undergraduate, I wanted to be a (liberal) rabbi, mostly focusing on the history and historicity of the Hebrew Bible.  I'm now in a sociology PhD program, and though it's not my thesis project, I am doing a small study of a specific Haredi (""Ultra-Orthodox"") group and try to keep up on that end of the literature, as well. 

* **gingerkid1234** 	Judaism and Jewish History

    I studied Jewish texts fairly intensely from literary, historical, and religious perspectives at various Jewish schools.  As a consequence, my knowledge starts around the Second Temple era and extends from there, and is most thorough in the area of historical religious practice, but Jewish history in other areas is critical to understanding that.  My knowledge of texts extends from Hebrew bible to the early Rabbinic period to later on.  It's pretty thorough, but my knowledge of texts from the middle ages tends to be restricted to the more prominent authors.  I also have a fairly thorough education (some self-taught, some through school) of Jewish history outside of religious text and practices, focusing on the late Middle Ages to the present.

    I'm proficient in all varieties of Hebrew (classical, late ancient, Rabbinic, and modern), and can figure out ancient Jewish Aramaic.  Because of an interest in linguistics, I have some knowledge about the historical development of Jewish languages, including the above, as well as Judeo-Arabic, Judeo-Romance languages, and Yiddish.

* **CaidaVidus** 	US-Israel Relations 

    I have worked on the political and social ties that bind the U.S. and Israel (and, to a lesser extent, the U.S. and the Jewish people). I specialize in the Mandate Period (pre-state of Israel, ca.1920-1948), particularly the armed Zionist resistance to British rule in Palestine. I also focus on the transition within the U.S. regarding political and public support of Israel, specifically the changing zeitgeist between 1967 and 1980.

* **haimoofauxerre**	Early Middle Ages | Crusades 

     I work on religion and violence in the early and central European Middle Ages (ca. 700-1300 CE). Mostly I focus on the intellectual and cultural roots of Christian animosity towards Muslims, Jews, and ""heretical"" Christians but I'm also at the beginning of a long-term research project about the idea of ""Judeo-Christianity"" as a political and intellectual category from antiquity to the present day USA.

My understanding of this period in history is limited to what I was taught in school (very little between the Norman Conquest and the late Tudors), so I only really have what’s been in the [news recently](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leicestershire-21083005) to go on. There have been a lot of points made that the story of a hunchbacked tyrant was not true and that Richard was actually a well-respected Duke who was simply betrayed by those he thought he could trust.

I'd like to announce a new sister subreddit to /r/AskHistorians and the rest of the /r/Ask... family, **/r/AskAnthropology**. It's devoted to anthropology, which to the uninitiated is the holistic ""science of humanity"" and traditionally encompasses human evolution and physical diversity (biological anthropology), cultural and sociolinguistic diversity (sociocultural and linguistic anthropology) and archaeology. We get a lot of questions on those subjects here; but while we have a number of fantastic flaired users who specialise in some aspect of anthropology, they unfortunately don't always get high quality answers. So the idea of /r/AskAnthropology is to have a Q&amp;A subreddit focusing on anthropology alone, giving them a better chance of getting answered.

Myself and our very own /u/Pachacamac have started the new sub, and I've invited some of our anthropologically-minded flairs to start the panel, so it will very much be run in the same mould as /r/AskHistorians. We're already off to a good start with a number of interesting questions (some shamelessly pinched from recent questions here that weren't answered), so please do come along, subscribe, ask questions, and help us get it off the ground! And if you're knowledgeable about anthropology or a related discipline, we of course need people to answer them too! 

I should point out that **this by no means implies that questions about prehistory and archaeology are no longer appropriate for /r/AskHistorians!** Rather, archaeology, and especially historic and late prehistoric archaeology, is the nice fuzzy overlap zone, and questions about it are welcome in either sub. We may gently steer questions that are *exclusively* about, say, evolution or ""human nature"" towards /r/AskAnthropology, in the same way we often suggest people crosspost questions about historical linguistics to /r/linguistics. But otherwise it's business as usual here.

Many of us (mods and general users alike) have noticed a sharp increase in questions and comments in /r/askhistorians recently that are less about historical discussion than they are -- implicitly or explicitly -- about hashing out the upcoming presidential election in the United States.

In a bid to avoid the infighting, flaring tempers and circle-jerkery that so often attend discussion of this subject in so many hundreds of other subreddits, we would like to encourage /r/askhistorians subscribers to **leave this matter aside** while posting here.

/r/askhistorians is a subreddit dedicated to historical discussion, not present-day politics and economics. The somewhat arbitrary cut-off year of 1992 in the sidebar is meant to exclude the present day, which is -- so to speak -- an unsettled country. The choice of a 20-year window is certainly one that invites complications, but there should be little debate about the validity of spending a lot of time in /r/askhistorians on something that's not only currently happening but which hasn't even concluded yet.

Temporal concerns aside, we seek comments in /r/askhistorians that are informed, humble and delivered in a spirit of charity -- many of the comments that we've had to address on this subject over the past couple of weeks have had none of these qualities. We want our subscribers to be able to read through the submissions here without having to keep stumbling across irrelevant tripe about Stalin just being a precursor to Obama or the Golden Horde having nothing on Romney's Bain Capital.

/r/askhistorians serves subscribers from all around the world, not just the United States, and they come here to discuss history. We want to keep it that way.

Being that I enjoyed this job so much, I went on and got my Master's in Public History, with a focus on museum education. Along the way, I worked at a few other museums (mostly historic houses), and served as the education coordinator for two small, struggling museums.

Almost every Homeric hero rapes someone at one point or another. The gods are constantly raping people. Even in ancient culture, the inhabitants of a conquered city were typically raped.

On the other hand, rape seems at times like it's condemned. In the Greek myths, a number of men are punished in the Underworld for raping women or attempting to rape a goddess. Homer in particular seems contradictory -- on the one hand, the major feud between Achilles and Agamemnon is that Agamemnon took Briseis away from him; she was *his* to be raped. On the other hand, the gods do punish people for raping others. Ajax rapes Cassandra on the altar of Athena and is later killed by Poseidon in punishment. In some myths, Orion tries to rape Artemis and is killed either by her or Apollo. Tityos tried to rape Leto and was punished in a manner similar to Prometheus.

With the Romans, rape seems to be the cause of a number of problems historically. The rape of Lucretia sparks the creation of the Roman Republic. The rape of Verginia incited the people to drive out the Decemvirs.

Naturally the ancient world was full of palace hallways riddled with concealed spy-holes and spies to peek through them, but what exactly did spies do in those days, and do we know anything about the formal structure of Roman (or other) intelligence gathering efforts?

I suppose the inherently secretive and clandestine nature of an intelligence agency is such that perhaps above all other organizations, it would be the hardest to find hard evidence for, especially if you are looking for that evidence thousands of years after the organization has ceased to exist.

It would be pretty cool if the Emperor had some secret order of assassins or spies, sort of like a cloak-and-dagger alternative to the Legions... not unlike America's use of both the CIA and the military, sometimes separately, sometimes together, depending on the situation.

Since this subreddit’s inception nearly two years ago, we’ve grown to be one of the bigger subs on Reddit, arguably the most active history board on the internet (depending on how one defines that), and we’re often lauded as one of the most consistently academic and reliable sections of Reddit.

All of this is thanks to the work of many people, but one of the groups that deserves a special amount of recognition is our flaired users.

Alas, as we have grown larger than I ever imagined, we could use some additional flaired users. While we have many skilled people currently answering questions for us routinely, we are also aware that we have pretty big gaps in our collective expertise. For example—our India specialists are particularly scant. 

Even in those disciplines for which we *do* have good posters, *more* commenters can only diversify our focus, taking our current status as a sub for historical *explanation* among experts, to the next level—a sub for historical *discussion* among experts. I know, for example, /u/NMW has been itching to get into some deep WWI discussions.

For these reasons, the moderating team is opening, for this week, our first ever **FLAIR DRIVE**! Here’s what that entails:

1. There are people on this subreddit who consistently post fantastic answers, yet continue to muck around without flair. We want these people signing up, ASAP. Signing up for flair allows us to more easily pinpoint where our experts are, so we can organize our subreddit better. So, *please*, if you know your historical niche quite well, *please* apply! We’ll be messaging people who we think make good candidates, but if you don’t get a letter, that doesn’t mean we don’t want you applying—it just means you’ve gotten lost among the piles of great posters we have on this sub.

2. Tell your historically-inclined friends/family about the sub! We know that there are history buffs hidden in the woodwork all over the place—please direct them to /r/askhistorians for us!

3. We (the mod team) will be going around to other subreddits, asking their respective mod teams for names of particularly knowledgeable individuals, whom we will then proceed to invite to our sub, encouraging them to make the requisite 3-5 quality comments for flair.

So here’s what we ask you:

•	If you fit in the description in the above number one, APPLY!

•	If you know some history buffs, follow the instructions in number two!

•	Let us know if you have any other ideas to encourage people to sign up for flair!

Thanks, 

Your Local Mod Team

My name is Heribert von Feilitzsch. I grew up in Germany, only yards from the East German border, the ""Iron Curtain."" In 1988 I came to the United States as a student. Fascinated with the ""Tortilla Curtain,"" the Mexican-American border, I pursued a Masters Degree in Latin-American History with focus on Mexican-American relations at the University of Arizona. The Mexican-American border still constitutes a barrier that divides two cultures, two distinct national identities, and creates a complicated economic and political framework worth studying. Last year, after 20 years of research, I published a book about the German spy Felix A. Sommerfeld, who became a very influential actor in the Mexican Revolution and the German intelligence organization in the USA during World War I. 

As a historian I believe in three basic premises: Let the information lead you to the story, do not use hindsight to judge historical actors, and triangulate all available information to form your theses.  

I will answer any questions that concern the time period of 1906 to 1918 that have to do with Mexico, the United States, and Germany. My special interest is intelligence history and German involvement in U.S. and Mexican relations in that time period.

This will make us one of the 125 largest subreddits on this site.  This is going to present a few new challenges for us.  Here they are with their answer.

**1)  Default status.**

Askhistorians WILL NEVER BECOME A DEFAULT SUB IF WE HAVE ANY SAY SO.  I believe the way we put it in moderator discussion was, ""I would rather burn this sub to the ground than let it become a default sub.""  That was me, I said that, and everyone agreed.  We have already set the system to not allow this sub to become part of the default set.

**2)  More posters**

We recognize that there are more people posting here.  Therefore we have a few things in place.  Firstly, we will be contacting users we have singled out for their quality posting to become moderators.  This will bring the team up to about 17 moderators.  This will allow moderators to participate as well as moderate as it will take some of the stress off of them.  Additionally we would like to direct you to [the Panel thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/13kurw/the_panel_of_historians_iv/) and the [Quality Contributor thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/16hjgd/meta_flaired_users_list_quality_contributor_flair/).  If you feel that you would like to receive flair or nominate someone for flair, feel free to use these links to nominate yourself or others.

Additionally, more posters means more users unfamiliar with this subreddits rules and culture.  So let me direct you again to [OUR RULES](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules) as well as our [GUIDELINES FOR RULES](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/16r63g/meta_some_reminders_and_clarifications_about/).  Think of them like this, the Rules = Constitution, Clarification = The Laws.  Both are enforceable, and will be.

We also request that you view the [POPULAR QUESTIONS](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/faq) thread before you ask.

**3)Now we need to also make a few of our rules clear to you guys, again.  These are the important rules**

1)  20 year rule.  If it has occurred in the past twenty years, it is off limits pending moderator review.

2)  NO RACISM, SEXISM, HOMOPHOBIA, OR OTHER BIGOTED BEHAVIOR

I am so not kidding.  Do not think you are being clever, we have many historians in this sub who actually specialize in racial, sexual, or gender history INCLUDING A MOD.  We have had more than enough experience in recognizing the behavior.  Yes, if you come here and post something racist and you are from one of the several racist or other biggoted subreddits, we will not only thoroughly thrash your propaganda, but we will also ban you.  Yes, we will read through your posting history to see if you have a history of bigotry.

3)  No soapboxing or speechifying.

You hate America?  Fine, go somewhere else.  You a die hard college communist?  Great.  Go somewhere else.  This is not the place to recruit, to rabble rouse, to instigate.  At this point we have plenty of experience spotting that too.  You will have your post removed.

4)  Copy Pasting **ANY SOURCE** as your only way of posting, is VERBOTEN.  People come here to receive quality, in depth analysis from historians, history students, and history buffs.  Please assume the OP of the question isn't a complete moron and has googled for the answer.  Additionally, this is /r/askhistorians, not /r/askgoogle.  Yes, you can copy and paste a source and give a summary of that link and source,  but simply throwing up a link or a wall of copied text is intellectually lazy and will result in the post being removed.

5)  On topic, relevant humor only.  No memes, advice animals, reaction gifs, or funny videos are allowed.  The humor cannot be top tiered comments.  Humor is allowed to stray more off topic in *meta threads only*.  Jokes otherwise must be relevant, on topic, and hopefully funny.  I personally hate puns.

6)  Topic drift.  The original Godwins Law stated that the longer a UseNet conversation went the more likely Hitler was to be brought up.  It meant the thread was dead.  Here we also avoid topic drift.  A logical progression of topics being brought up is allowed, but please, don't let a thread on 19th Century agriculture end up about cow tipping.

7) Anecdotes are frowned upon.  Unless you were there yourself at the event, its probably not a strong enough source.

8) If you are guessing, or you heard from something somewhere some time ago, don't bother.  We will delete with extreme prejudice.

9) Wikipedia is the worst possible source you can use.  Its acceptable at times, and in a pinch, but it really isn't a good source.  If you couldn't use it in a paper, it probably wont work here.


**4) Eternal~~kerri~~ September

In light of the ever expanding number of users, of course there will be cries of Eternal September.  The moderation team can only do so much.  We need the user base to assist us by flagging violating posts as spam.  We also want you to understand **we enforce rules here**.  If you have a problem with the rules, address them to the moderation team, but Braveheart style speeches do not endear us to your plight (neither does calling us faggots after we ban you).  The level of our enforcement and strictness of enforcement, as well as our patience is directly inverse to the level of chicanery in the sub.  The more the rules are violated, the more people flagrantly violate them, the more people thumb their noses at the mods, the more likely we are to increase the intensity and harshness of our moderation.

If the book averages two or more footnotes per page, think twice and justify its inclusion. Secondary and tertiary sources are *strongly* favored: this is for general readers. Feel free to ignore these suggestions, but include reasons for why you are ignoring it (ie, ""This is an academic work, but is highly readable""). As Agentdcf pointed out, we don't want this turning into the ""History"" section at the Barnes &amp; Noble, but also bare in mind that these works should be accessible both in terms of content and in terms of availability. Anything, however, is acceptable with sufficient justification.

So, without further ado:

**General**

1. *Why the West Rules, for Now* by Ian Morris: An excellent overview of both Western and Eastern history. Morris combines a readable style and an ability to explain historical concepts in an easy manner with a historian's rigor. An excellent introduction to the topic of historical studies.

2. *A Little History of the World* by Ernst Gombrich. It is essentially a summary of human history to around the 1930s. I read this when I was younger - it's aimed perfectly at interested children, and manages to be accessible and entertaining without being condescending.

3. *Cities* by John Reader. A social history of the development of cities - particularly good chapters on the Renaissance and Mexico City stick in my mind.

4. Winchester's *Atlantic* is a very interesting history of the Atlantic Ocean, and particularly of the relationship between Britain and the Americas. It is somewhat similar to Kurlansky and Bryson's work but still enjoyable. Winchester has also written a book on the invention of the dictionary - I haven't read it but it's supposed to be excellent.

5. *The Mediterranean in the Time of Philip the Second* by Fernand Braudel: Possibly the most important work of history of the 20th cen. I probably wouldn't argue this, but my point is the case can and has been made. It's a major major work -- and tremendously written. When we talk about Jared Diamond, we're talking about big, long, slow processes as determining the shape of history. That's Braudel, in a nutshell--except he tried to deal with everything from trade, warfare, religion, urbanism, naval technology, culture, individual agency, etc. He may not have succeeded in explaining everything, but he literally changed the game in France in the 1950s and 60s (and 70s in America, when his work was translated into English).

6. *Empires of the Word* by Nicholas Oster: A great work of general world history for the general public. Exploring history through the lens of languages give a new perspective on many eras. As a bonus, a historian's work is often based around reading primary sources - knowing why the primary sources are in a particular language helps you appreciate them all the more.

7. *The Prize* by Daniel Yergin: Describes the history of the oil industry beginning in the 1800s through the 1990s. Combines many historical narrative types to create a sweeping, global narrative of how oil has impacted all aspects of society. Particularly good at explaining the science aspect of the oil industry--how oil is found and produced, how oil varies from region to region, etc.

**Historiography**

1. *Who Owns Antiquity?* by James Cuno. Title is self-explanatory - discusses issues of nationality and imperialism in the management of historical artefacts. The author is making an argument against nationalistic retention, but still provides a very good overview.

2. *The Landscape of History* John Lewis Gaddis: If you are interested in how History and Historians view the world around them and the world of the past this is for you. You'll often hear references to 'thinking like a lawyer' or some other profession. Gaddis sums up what it means to think like a historian. He also provides a strong line in the sand between historical inquiry and the social sciences and I personally enjoyed him sort of tearing into the objectivity and the 'scientific' approach that social scientists shroud themselves in.

3. *What is History* E. H. Carr: Read this for the same reason you would read Gibbon's decline and fall. Its extremely eloquent and flat out beautiful in its prose at times. E H Carr was a leading man in the historical field in the mid 20th century. He treads a middle line between empiricism and idealism. To quote from a review 'Arguably the central ideas in the book constitute today's mainstream thinking on British historical practice'.

4. *History: A very short introduction* John H Arnold: Its short. Its less a true 'historiography' in that it doesn't get into method or theory and is more a history of history. Again I will quote a far more able reviewer.
""This is an extremely engaging book, lively, enthusiastic and highly readable, which presents some of the fundamental problems of historical writing in a lucid and accessible manner. As an invitation to the study of history it should be difficult to resist.""--Peter Burke, Emmanuel College, Cambridge

5. *That Noble Dream: The ""Objectivity Question"" and the American Historical Profession* by Peter Novick. Addresses the naivete of the ideal of objectivity. A nice complement to Gaddis in some respects, though Gaddis is probably the better volume.

**Modern History**--The study of history beginning with the 19th century globalization.

*East Asia*

1. *A Modern History of Japan* by Andrew Gordon

2. *War without Mercy* by John Dower is pretty much the best comparative look at race and ideology in the Pacific War. It's long and a bit academic, but there's none better. (WWII)

3. *America's Geisha Ally* by Naoko Shibusawa Is a very readable account of the cultural and media politics of the US occupation of Japan. It examines the transformation of Japan from implacable enemy to ""geisha ally"" in US eyes, and in doing so, explains much of Japan's current relationship with the US. (US occupation of Japan)

3. *Under the Loving Care of the Fatherly Leader* by Bradley K. Martin: It blends into journalism by the end (plenty of descriptions of current happenings), but his explanations of Japanese occupation, revolution and Kim Il-Sung's rise to power was quite good.

4. *Embracing Defeat* by John Dower: The benchmark book on immediate postwar culture in Japan. It is a bit more readable than War Without Mercy. (Immediate Post-WWII)

5. *Rearranging the Landscape of the Gods* by Sarah Thal: Nominally this work is about the Konpira Shrine and its changes from the late Sengoku to the modern world. But it goes far deeper, and provides a vivid illustration of the extraordinary changes in Japanese socity, particularly during the tumultuous times after the Meiji Restoration.

*Europe/""The West""*

1. *Cod and Salt* by Mark Kurlansky are similar to Bryson - both use a somewhat obscure but still fascinating subject matter to narrate the rise of America (among other things). His work is very readable.

2. *The Balkans* by Mark Mazower: A Brief Summary of Balkan history to the present day, but nevertheless very insightful. A great starting point to see why people tend to have been wrong about the Balkans.

3. *Yugosavia: Twice there was a Country* by John Lampe: A great overview of the turbulent 20th century and the brief existence of a Yugoslav state.

4. *Postwar: A history of Europe since 1945* by Tony Judt: Very detailed and good overview of Europe's post war history.

5. *George, Nicholas, and Wilhelm* by Miranda Carter: A very good account of the politics leading up to WWI; Carter's thesis is that the actions of George V of England, Nicholas II of Russia, and Wilhelm of Germany had repercussions and led the countries to war. It helps if you have an understanding of late 19th century politics, but it's not necessary. Carter's writing is pretty scholarly, but I caught myself laughing a few times while reading - really readable.

*Eastern Europe*

1. *Bloodlands: Europe between Hitler and Stalin* by Timothy Snyder. Very readable account of the events in countries caught between the Soviet Union and Hitler's Germany during the beginnings of WWII, starting with Ukraine's Holodomor and the political tensions that rose from Stalin's paranoia of outside influence during those events. Really gives you a sense of the suffering of the people.

2. *The Dictators* by Richard Overy. This is not quite a readable as Snyder, but a very well-written and well-documented comparative history of the regimes of Hitler and Stalin, highly recommended for the enthusiast already familiar with the general details of each regime's history and wanting to really gain an understanding of their similarities and differences.

3. *Darkness at Dawn: The Rise of the Russian Criminal State* by Satter. Very readable and recent history of the rise of the criminal influence in Russian government following the downfall of the Soviet Union. Really uses his understanding of Russian psychology gained by years as the Moscow correspondent for the WSJ to give insight into what happened and why.

4. Three books by Richard Pipes: *Russia Under the Old Regime, The Russian Revolution* and *Russia Under the Bolshevik Regime*. Pipes has a somewhat conservative take on events, but the writing clearly quarantines his opinion away from his facts, and, well, for someone who still remembers standing in line around the block for stale bread in winter of '92, like myself, his harsh criticism is not unjustified.

5. *The Russian Revolution* by Sheila Fitzpatrick is a shorter summary of the Revolution which is extremely readable.

6. *The Oligarchs: Wealth and Power in the New Russia* by Davis Hoffman. A very well-written account of the rise of the current Russian inner-circle in the highest echelons of power under Putin in the years during the downfall of the Soviet Union. Starts with short biographies of the 6 main players in this history, and then gives a fascinating detailed account of their accumulation of and fights for power.

*North America*

1. *1861: The Civil War Awakening* by Adam Goodheart: A popular history book that discusses the mood of the nation in the lead-up to the Civil War.

2. *Arc of Justice: A Saga of Race, Civil Rights, and Murder in the Jazz Age* by Kevin Boyle: Winner of a National Book Award, this book is a great introduction to housing discrimination and racial tensions in Detroit in the early part of the 20th century.

3. *Red Hills and Cotton: An Upcountry Memory* by Ben Robertson: Provides a history of the upcountry of South Carolina as memoirs.

4. *Black Majority: Negroes in Colonial South Carolina from 1670 through the Stono Rebellion* by Peter H. Wood: Discusses the early history of African slaves in Colonial South Carolina to the plantation period.

5. *The Glorious Cause* by Robert Middlekauf: Rather by definition the master book on the Revolution. Not formative or revolutionary in its approach, but a comprehensive look at the entire war.

6. *Who Killed Canadian History?* - Jack Granatstein. If you want to go in to any depth in Canadian history, reading Granatstein is a must. This is one of his more controversial books, it's always under fire from other scholars, which makes it an interesting read about Canadian history.

7. *The Empire Within* - Sean Mills. Important because it provides detailed information about the rise, and existence of the FLQ. Important to show that Quebec has a distinct history from the rest of the country.

8. *Towards Defining the Prairies: Region, Culture, and History. A Collection of Essays about the Canadian West* from Gerald Friesen to W.C. Morton. Way more academic. Shows how unique the Canadian west is, and much like Quebec, how it has its own distinct history.

9. *John Adams* by David McCullough: Very readable account of an often misunderstood man. Particularly great at juxtaposing Adams's vanity with his genuine belief in the ideas of the American Revolution.

10. *Battle Cry of Freedom* by James McPherson: Widely considered as the seminal one-volume work on the Civil War period, focusing holistically on the economic, social, political, and military aspects of the time.

11. *Oxford History of the United States* series, of which I don't think I have seen anything negative written about any of the books in the series.

12. *Parting the Waters: America in the King Years, 1954-1963* by Taylor Branch: a Pulitzer Prize winning book detailing, as the title implies, the civil rights movement in the United States.

*Middle East*

1. *Palestine and the Arab-Israeli Conflict:* a history with documents by Smith. This is a nice, concise history of the conflict that contains accessible documents that are relevant to the previous section. It is largely low-bias and perfectly captures both sides of the debate.

2. *Turkey: A Modern History* by Zurcher. This book, while lacking in primary source references in some spots, is the most expansive modern history of a country that I've ever read. It manages it's events in a clear way, and connects the important events to the overall history of the middle east.

3. *A History of the Arab Peoples*: Albert Hourani, a classic in the discipline.

4. *The Modern Middle East: A History* James Gelvin, I think this book wants to avoid being a textbook but ends up in the same place, but does it better and in fewer pages than Cleveland.

5. *A Brief History of the Late Ottoman Empire* M. Şükrü Hanioğlu, because none of the other synthetic histories of the late Ottoman Empire are as brief or succinctly worded as this one.

6. *Osman's Dream: A History of the Ottoman Empire* by Caroline Finkel: the best, and really only, single-volume history of the OE. Most of the rest are a snore to read.

7. *A Quiet Revolution: The First Palestinian Intifada and Nonviolent Resistance* by Mary E. King:
The title is fairly self explanatory, but I think it gives a good analysis of the events. Also the focus on the non-violence movement and its effect are frequently missing from the popular discourse on the matter.

8. *The Middle East: A Brief History of the Last 2,000 Years* by Bernard Lewis -This is a very readable book by the fields leading scholar.

9. *A History of Iran: Empire of the Mind* by Michael Axworthy

10. *Rule Of Experts: Egypt, Technopolitics and Modernity* by Timothy Mitchell: an innovative take on the history of the modern world in eight interlocking essays about Egypt in the 20th century which deal with everything from land surveys to the plagiarisms of mid-century anthropology to a history of the Aswan Dam from the perspective of a mosquito. This book challenges traditional ways of talking about history by deemphasizing human agency and focusing on the formative power of knowledge practices and technology.

11. *Afghanistan: A Cultural and Political History* by Thomas Barfield: Broad history detailing the political changes that have taken place within Afghanistan over the past few centuries, along with a readable description of the various ethnic groups residing within the country.

12. *All the Shah's Men* by Stephen Kinzer: A great read about the overthrow of Iran's shah, the role of the U.S. in that coup, and the eventual rise of the revolutionary movement in the region.

**Western Eurasia**--The study of civilizations ultimately derived from Mesopotamian agriculture.

*Near East*

1. *Persian Fire* by Tom Holland: is a really great introduction, whilst also being a great book about Greek History at the same time. Now, because he is deliberately constructing a comprehensive world for readers he is having to fill in quite a few gaps, and in my opinion not always correctly. But nonetheless his style of writing will leave you with a very clear image of the cultures he writes about. 

2. *Rise and Fall of Egypt* by Toby Wilkinson It's very well written with a superb narrative style and from an academic perspective its predominantly spot on. It tends to gloss over some of the debates which are still ongoing but only to maintain a cohesive narrative.

3. *The Twilight of Ancient Egypt* by Karol Mysliwiec. It covers the cultural melting pot in the Nile valley quite nicely and is very accessible in terms of style. Not quite as general a history as Toby Wilkinson though.

4. *The Tomb in Ancient Egypt* by Salima Ikram: which is comprehensive and full of beautiful pictures to properly track evolution of funerary culture. 

5. *Complete Pyramids* by Mark Lehner: Of a similar ilk but more focused on the old kingdom complexes.

6. *The Bible Unearthed* by Israel Finkelstein and Neil Asher Silberman. Among the most popular introductory level books on any biblical subject ever written. Just be a little bit careful, Finkelstein works in his ""low chronology"" without preface, which is good for his inteded audience, but bad for a broader view, as it remains contentious. It's worth picking up Grabbe's book to help spot where he does so.

7. *Did God Have a Wife *by William Dever. Dever has a decidedly more conservative flair, but trumps other more conservative scholars by being an archaeologist, and--for the most part--giving the archaeology priority.

8. *Israel's History and the History of Israel* by Mario Liverani. Liverani stands out as being perhaps the truest scholar of the Ancient Near East generally to write on the history of Israel, and this is valuable on that basis alone.

9. *Ancient Israel: What do we know and how do we know it?* by Lester Grabbe. Despite the somewhat colloquial feel of the title, this is not light reading. Nor is it intended to be, it provides a succinct, easily understandable discussion of all of the major debates in Israelite archaeology today. It wonderfully fills a fairly obvious gap for a quick and dirty reference for recent discoveries.

10. *Biblical History and Israel's Past*, Megan B. Moore and Brad E. Kelle (2011). I can't say enough about how fantastic this book is. The breadth and accessibility of this overview of the current state of research is incredible. The suggested reading at the end of each chapter provides a wonderful selection of equally readable texts (at least among ones I've read). Just. . .fantastic.


*Classical Civilization*

*Iron Age Europe*

1. *The World of the Celts* by Simon James: Provides a condensed overview of the Celtic world including everything from theoretical beginnings to the idea of modern Celts and from fighting Rome to farming practices.

2. *The Atlantic Celts: Ancient People or Modern Invention* by Simon James: A very short book which outlines the development of the Celtic ""myth."" Its conclusions are fairly controversial, but some very interesting light is shone on the creation of national identities.


*Greece*

1. *Thundering Zeus: The Making of Hellenistic Bactria, by Frank L. Holt* (1999): It's quite a current book, it's well researched, it's a great introduction to Bactria and to Central Asia as an entity.

2. *From Samarkhand to Sardis*, by Susan Sherwin White and Amelie Kuhrt. It's very well written, it introduced the approach of looking at the Hellenistic world and Seleucid Empire in their own right as opposed to just an extension of Classical Greece, and it is very comprehensive.


*Rome*

1. *Why Rome Fell* by Adrian Goldsworthy: Goldsworthy is the author of numerous works of popular history and is very familiar with the form. He provides and excellent and detailed narrative, as well as an analysis focused on political systems.

2. *The Fires of Vesuvius* by Mary Beard: Readable and lively, Beard captures the vivacious character of Pompeii along with providing an introduction to the field of classical archaeology.

3. *Rubicon* by Tom Holland: A great read that really brings Republican Rome to life.

4. *Mediterranean Anarchy, Interstate War, and the Rise of Rome* by Arthur Eckstein: I'm probably biased because Dr. Eckstein is one of my professors, but this book brought up an idea of why Rome came to be the preeminent Mediterranean power that hadn't really been explored extensively yet. Eckstein chose to explain it in modern Realist terms of political relations and alliances, rather than the raw brutality and tendencies towards violence which characterized the period - something he argues was not unique to Rome at all, nor were they ""better"" at it than anyone, as was the prevailing theory.

5. *The Fall of Rome and End of Civilization* by Bryan Ward-Perkins: A work that has quickly become a standard, it uses archaeology to provocatively draw a harsh line between the Roman and post-Roman world. It also functions as an excellent introduction to archaeology and the Roman economy.


*Medieval*

1. *The Year 1000* by Robert Lacey and Danny Danziger: a fascinating narrative history of the year 1000. It is short and certainly aimed at a mass market but still informative and entertaining.

2. *Exploring the World of the Vikings* by Richard Hall: Written by the former head of the archaeological digs in York, it's the best and most up-to-date overview of the Viking age. It's a bit archaeology-heavy, but in that field that's a must, due to the basically non-existing genuine historical tradition.

3. *The Crusades: The Authoritative History of the War for the Holy Land* by Thomas Asbridge: Asbridge is one of the leading modern scholars of the crusades, and this books is not only expansive in its scope, covering the crusading movement from genesis to the aftermath of the fall of Acre, but it is also quite readable. Plus it's quite inexpensive for a scholarly work. Heavily focused on the Third Crusade, particularly on Saladin and Richard.

4. *The Grand Strategy of the Byzantine Empire* by Edward Luttwak. Luttwak focuses on the general narrative of Byzantium in this book. He spends time detailing the military, social, political, and cultural realities of the Byzantine Empire and outlines why it was able to function as long as it did in spite of a great many internal and external stressors.

5. *The Civilization of the Middle Ages: A Completely Revised and Expanded Edition of Medieval History* by Norman F. Cantor: he is able to explain the schism of the Catholic church very well, as well as the various societies. He also presents a theory on why Eastern Europe opposed the use of icons.

*Early Modern*

1. *Natasha's Dance* by Orlando Figes is a very readable record of Russian history and cultural identity, from Peter the Great to the Soviet Union.

2. *The Origins of Modern Europe 1660-1789 by James L. White. Readable summary of European history during that period - I've only used a few chapters for papers but it was extremely useful.*

3. *Crucible of War: The Seven Years' War and the Fate of Empire in British North America, 1754-1766* by Fred Anderson: It was a great book about the events that proceeded (and Anderson asserts helped to bring about) the American Revolution while also touching upon the broader war between Britain and France throughout the world (Havana, the Philippines, India, Europe). But don't be fooled, this is mainly focused on the invasion of Canada and what would become the Midwest and the immediate aftermath.

4. *The Dutch Republic: Its Rise, Greatness, and Fall 1477-1806* by Jonathan Israel: An impressive scholarly well-documented account of the history of the Low Countries (in relation to the rest of Early Modern Europe). Yet, very accessible for the general reader.

5. *The Rise of Modern Warfare 1618-1815* by H.W. Koch: Absolutely full of etchings, portraits, and diagrams. Divided into several sections based on country: England, France, Russia, etc., as well as general discussion of modern warfare. Each section discusses uniform, armament, and tactics. Suitable for in-depth study or just looking at the pictures.

6. For Russian history, anything by Robert Massie. *Peter the Great, Catherine the Great, The Romanovs.* Very readable, well-written, well-researched, very detailed and in-depth and yet never boring accounts of Russian history.

7. *History of Russia* by Vernadsky. A readable overview of Russian history from Kievan Rus' through WWII, if you get one of the later editions (the earliest edition was published in 1929). Much better written than Riasanovsky's still-in-print book of the same name, which I could never understand why people enjoy reading.

8. *The Return of Martin Guerre* by Natalie Zemon Davis: Heavy archival research backs an exploration of common culture in a 16th-century French village. Particularly present are questions of identity, evidence, and community. This is a very popular work by a celebrated American cultural historian of early modern France

9. *The Cheese and the Worms: The Cosmos of a Sixteenth-Century Miller* by Carlo Ginzburg: The author uses archival research to address questions of how common people lived in early modern (northern) Italy. The book offers a glimpse of the ways common people participated in the discourse of ideas in counter-reformation Italy.

*Early Modern Colonial*

1. *Mayflower by Nathaniel Philbrick* - a very good book about the founding of Plymouth Plantation, and the first 50 years afterwards.

2. *Mayflower Bastard* - An interesting book, about a young boy on the Mayflower, and his life afterwards up to and including the Salem Witch Trials. The style of the book is offputting to some, and the author has been criticised for including too much supposition, but it is worth a read.

3. *Savage Kingdom* by Benjamin Woolley - a very well written account of the Jamestown colony, including a lot of detailed build up explaining the background to the colony's founding. Almost as much of the book is set in England as it is in the new colony.

4. *Big Chief Elizabeth* by Giles Milton - Giles Milton is definitely popular, rather than academic, history, but he has a great readable style and his books seem to be well researched. This book is about the precursors to the Jamestown colony in Virginia, including the lost colony of Roanoke.

5. *The Island at the Centre of the World* by Russell Shorto - the story of the founding of New York (New Amsterdam) based on 17th century Dutch records which have only recently been discovered/translated. An extremely good book.

6. *A Voyage Long and Strange* by Anthony Horowitz - a popular history book about early European colonisation attempts of America, before the successful Jamestown colony. Written as a semi-travelogue by the author, but an interesting read.

7. *The Age of Reconnaissance* by J. H. Parry: A formidable classic on the Western Expansion and the age of exploration. Parry provides a dense but excellent description of how the west was able to conquer and their motivations. His section on the development of scientific navigation is particularly good.

**East Asian History**--The study of civilizations ultimately derived from the Yellow River Valley

*China*

1. *China: A New History* by John K. Fairbank: An excellent introduction to the topic by the doyen of American Sinology. China's modern history is the main concern, but the earlier periods are treated sufficiently.

2. *The Search for Modern China* by Jonathan Spence. It's a pretty good overview that starts with the Ming and goes through the late 1980s. Covers all the bases. Nothing is covered in exceptional depth (with a subject like China it rarely can be in a single book) but for a general idea of recent Chinese history it's more than adequate. Also, a very readable book.

3. *A History of Chinese Civilization* by Jacques Gernet: A readable and detailed survey of Chinese history that is notable for not prejudicing modern history over earlier periods. It heavily focuses on intellectual and cultural history, and at times the details of the political history get ignored, but any survey this ambitious must make cuts. The account of the nineteenth century is particularly vivid.

4. *China's Cosmopolitan Empire: The Tang Dynasty* by Mark Edward Lewis: Divided between sections on history, geography, the economy, society, and culture, this book is comprehensive without being overloaded--whether your interests are agriculture, the status of women, or the nature of the poet in society you will find information here. It also does well at torpedoing national mythology.

*Japan*

1. *As We Saw Them* by Masao Miyoshi is a highly readable account of the first Japanese mission to the west. It offers an interesting reversal of the typical narrative of Westerners observing inscrutable ""Orientals."" (1860)

2. *Civilization and Monsters* by Gerald Figal: an academic book, but extremely readable (in my opinion- the one amazon reviewer disagrees). Its central thesis that discourse on monsters, ghosts, the supernatural was central to the formation of modern Japan is surprisingly innovative, and fun to read. (Meiji period)

*Mongolia*

1. *Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World*: Entertaining, interesting and good for history geeks and the general population. There are some misrepresentations that the author makes, and I also think that he relies on the Secret History a little too much, but all in all, awesome!

**South Asian History**

1. *Modern South Asia* by Sugata Bose and Ayesha Jalal: A very concise (less than 200 pages of narrative) history of South Asia from around 1600 CE onward. A very accessible and complete explanation of British colonialism in South Asia with a well-rounded perspective of the subsequent nationalist movements.

**Native American Peoples**

*Pre-Columbian*

1. *1491* by Charles Mann: A popular history book that covers the general history of Native Americans until European contact. It discusses both North and South America. Although Mann is not a professional historian, his work is very thought-provoking and approachable for a lay-audience. He also has a follow-up book, 1493, which covers interactions between Europeans and Native Americans post-contact.

*Post-Columbian*

1. *The Cherokee Cases* This book isn't too difficult, and it adds in a great deal about President Jackson, which is always a crowd pleaser. Although, this might sadden a great deal of Jackson lovers. This book details the politics behind Worcester v Georgia and Cherokee Nation v Georgia, which are the cornerstones of Native American Law.

2. *Custer Died For Your Sins* by Vine Deloria Jr: This book went a long way in shifting the focus of Anthropology and History away from Indians as objects and victims towards Indians as active participants. Written in 1969, I make sure students read this before they are allowed to talk about Native History. Indians have fantastic senses of humor, and this book really shows it.

3. *Landscape Traveled by Coyote and Crane* by Rodney Frey: This is is a representation of the perfect way in which to work with tribes to do Anthropology and History. He uses old stories and modern stories told by living Coeur d'Alene people to contextualize everything he writes. He involves the Coeur d'Alene people without losing his focus or professionalism.

4. *Trail of Tears: The Rise and Fall of the Cherokee Nation* by John Ehle: A very readable history of the Cherokee Nation. It follows the life of John Ridge, a Cherokee leader whose rise and fall parallels that of the nation.

**Cultural/Intellectual History**

1. *A Most Dangerous Book: Tacitus's Germania from the Roman Empire to the Third Reich* by Christopher B. Krebs: Provides an interesting history of Tacitus's Germania from contextualizing its writing to how it was sought after in Renaissance Italy to how it was eventually used for propaganda purposes.

2. *Buddhism in China: A Historical Survey* by Kenneth Ch'en: An excellent history of Chinese Buddhism, including its intellectual development and the societal reactions to it.

3. *From Dawn to Decadence: 1500 to the Present: 500 Years of Western Cultural Life* by Jacques Barzun: A magisterial work of cultural history, an end-of-life summa penned by one of the most civilized men ever to exist. It's both scholarly and accessible, narrated in gorgeous prose, and deserves a place on your bookshelf next to Thucydides, Tacitus, Gucciardini, Gibbon, Macaulay, and Burckhardt.

4. *Pioneers of Photography* by Aaron Scharf. Contains personal writings of Nicephore Niepce, the inventor of the first photograph, as well as biographies of other pioneers and an in-depth discussion of their techniques.

5. *Picture Machine: The Rise of American Newspictures* by William Hannigan and Ken Johnston. While mostly a collection of photographs, there is a very nice preface that discusses the adoption of photography by newspaper companies.

6. *Hippie* by Barry Miles: An excellent, detailed history of the counter culture from 1965-71 in both England and the U.S, from Ken Kesey and the Magic Bus, to the music scenes, to hippies, and Vietnam protests, he covers a lot. Also, there are a lot of pretty pictures and it looks great on a coffee table.

7. *Possessing Nature: Museums, Collecting, and Scientific Culture in Early Modern Italy* by Paula Findlen: This book looks at the development of scientific culture in Europe, using early modern (northern) Italy as a case study. Cultural forces like patronage and identity have large roles in proto-scientific circles.

8. *Playboy and the Making of the Good Life in America* by Elizabeth Fraterrigo and Bachelors and Bunnies: The Sexual Politics of Playboy by Carrie Pitzulo - both excellent books about not only Playboy magazine, but also postwar culture, American consumerism, and shifting gender roles in the 1960s and 1970s. You don't even have to have read Playboy to understand them!

*Exploration*

1. *The Last Expedition: Stanley's Mad Journey Through the Congo* by Daniel Liebowitz and Charles Pearson: This is the ideal book for anyone interested in Exploration. Stanley represents the end of the colonial explorer because of the intense and frightening stories brought back to England.

2. *Over the Edge of the World* by Laurence Bergreen: Bergreen is not a professional historian, but he presents the story of Magellan's circumnavigation in an entertaining way. He doesn't add anything new to the table, but I can respect someone who can take primary documents and make them enjoyable to read.

3. *Longitude* by Dava Sobel: This book details how the world figured to procedure of finding longitudinal coordinates in the world. Great Britain offered a huge cash prize to anyone able to work out a way to find longitude. Without a way to track longitude reliably, ships had been getting lost and running aground.

4. *The Worst Journey in the World* by Apsley Cherry-Gerrard: This is a first hand account written by one of the scientist on the expedition to the South Pole. The book is impressive because of how disastrous and pointless their expedition turn out. Terrific examples of the conditions near the pole.

*Terrorism*

1. *The History of Terrorism: From Antiquity to Al-Qaeda* by Gerard Chaliand and Arnaud Blin: Two French scholars trace the path of terrorism from the ancient world to the present day, with a particularly lucid section differentiating terrorism from other acts of violence. (academic)

2. *A History of Terrorism* by Walter Laqueur: Another broad history of terrorism. Laqueur takes an interesting stance, arguing that history and the social sciences can't accurately explain terrorism; instead, he believes studying literature is the best method for arriving at accurate conclusions about the phenomenon.

3. *Inside Terrorism* by Bruce Hoffman: Maybe considered the best work on terrorism. Holistic study explaining the era of modern terrorism (1968-present), with particularly adept analysis of the relationship between the media and terrorist groups. (academic)

4. *The Looming Tower* by Lawrence Wright: Excellent narrative history of the birth and rise of al-Qaeda, told mainly through multiple biographies of the key players.

5. *Bringing the War Home: The Weather Underground, the Red Army Faction and Revolutionary Violence in the Sixties and Seventies* by Jeremy Varon: A comparative work detailing the similarities and differences of German and American society in the 1960s and 1970s, as well as between the two terrorist organizations.*

*Christianity*

1. *The Historical Figure of Jesus* by E P Sanders. A popularization of his important work Jesus and Judaism. Intended for non-specialists, which may find the former incomprehensible.

2. *The Historical Jesus: Life of a Mediterranean Jewish Peasant* by John Crossan. I personally disagree with pretty well every word Crossan writes. But even when he's wrong, he's wonderfully productive. A contrast to Sanders view, representing two sides of one of the major debates of the last quarter century or so.

3. *Paul: A Very Short Introduction* by E P Sanders Sanders' work on Paul in his more academic books revolutionized Pauline studies over the last half century. The VSI series is always excellent, and this is no exception. A wonderful introduction to recent work on Paul and the so-called ""New Perspective on Paul.""

*History of Science*

1. *The Pasteurization of France* by Bruno Latour: I think Latour does a good job at showing the social and cultural prerequisites necessary to encourage the French to accept Pasteur's microbes as revealed truth, as well as the process by which these conditions are obscured in favor of the ""Great Man"" thesis.

2.  *A Social History of Truth: Civility and Science in Seventeenth-Century England* by Steve Shapin: Shapin deftly argues that the practice of science in seventeenth-century England relied heavily on the reliable word of ""experts"" in a particular field, as experiments were expensive and laborious to reproduce. Trust emerges as a critical element in the production of scientific knowledge, and Shapin demonstrates that what we assume to be objective in science often rests on this foundation of trust in the scientist (as it does in every academic field).

3. *Galileo, Courtier: The Practice of Science in the Culture of Absolutism* by Mario Biagioli: Biagioli shows how crucial the patron/client relationship was for scientists in early modern Europe - particularly for Galileo and his principal patron, Pope Urban VIII. Again, this is another work that unpacks the social networks that undergird(ed) scientific study.

4. *Objectivity* by Lorraine Daston and Peter Galison: The book traces a critical problem of representation in the Scientific Revolution, particularly relating to representing objects of scientific study in atlases. For example: when making an entry for oak trees in a botany book, what kind of picture should one include? No two oak trees will look the same (though they will look similar), so how does the artist draw it so that it can be easily recognized in real life by referencing the atlas? How do you draw something like cloud formations in an atlas to demonstrate the difference between Cirrus and Cumulus clouds, even though clouds are constantly changing shape? Daston and Galison do a great job explaining the context of these debates and anxieties and what they reveal about the practice of science.",,False,,t5_2ssp3,1369697436.0,,europe,True,t3_timi4,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/timi4/the_askhistorians_master_book_list/,

But 'the city' has been part of the conversation about the human past for a very long time.

The term 'city' can deal with many variagated kinds of state and society throughout history. We have the ancient cities of Mesopotamia, such as Ur, Uruk, Babylon and Assur. We have the *poleis* of the various Greek speaking cultures. We have various Roman built settlements and refoundations. We have the medieval merchant republic, and the medieval urban environments to which a *burgess* belonged. We have the industrial cities of the 19th and early 20th centuries. To dip out of Eurocentric perspectives a second, we have the great capitals of the various Chinese Empires, the city-states of Mesoamerica, the planned grids of Kyoto, post-Timur Samarkhand. There are probably many other variations on the concept of 'the city' that I've missed out here as well.

To clarify exactly what I'm asking;

* Are we right to refer to all of these as cities, and imply they are such directly comparable phenomena?

* What is the dividing line that makes an environment urban?

* Are there features of any particular period/culture's take on 'the city' that you think mark them out?

* Conversely, do you know of any pre-modern examples of cultural contact resulting in completely new ideas regarding 'the city'?

* Are there examples of cultures observably encountering cities when they possessed no similar concept of their own, and if so what resulted from this?

You can stop asking those questions now, we've solved those problems forever. Also, I think most of us are calling it a night. If you're question didn't get answered today, make a wish for the morrow (or post it later as its own question).

Your esteemed panel for today consists of:

- /u/snickeringshadow who has expertise in cultures west of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, especially the Tarascans and the cultures of Oaxaca, but whose magnificent knowledge extends to the Big 3, as well as writing systems.

- /u/Ahhuatl whose background is in history and anthropology, and is not afraid to go digging in the dirt. Despite the Nahautl name, this thorny individual's interest encompasses the Mixtec and Zapotec peoples as well. (Ahhuatl, due to time and scheduling constraints, will be joining later, so please keep the questions rolling in. We're committed to answering until our fingers bleed.)

- /u/historianLA, a specialist in sixteenth century spanish colonialism with a focus on race and ethnicity, who will also adroitly answer questions regarding the ""spiritual conquest"" of Mesoamerica and thus expects your questions about the Spanish Inquisition.

- /u/Reedstilt is our honorary Mesoamericanist, but also brings a comprehensive knowledge of Native American studies and a command of the kind of resources only a research librarian could have in order to answer questions on North American connections and the daily life of the past.

- and finally myself, /u/400-Rabbits. I have a background as a true four-field anthropologist (cultural, biological, archaeological, and pretending to know something about linguistics), but my interests lay in the Post-Classic supergroup known as the Aztecs. I am also the mod who will ban anyone who asks about aliens. Just kidding... maybe.

In this week's AMA, we'll be discussing the geocultural area known as Mesoamerica, a region that (roughly) stretches South from Central Mexico into parts of Central America. Mesoamerica is best known for it's rich pre-Columbian history and as a one of few ""cradles of human civilization"" that independently developed a suite of domesticated plants and animals, agriculture, writing, and complex societies with distinctive styles of art and monumental architecture. 

While most people with even a rudimentary historical education have heard of the Big 3 marquee names in Mesoamerica -- the Olmecs, Maya, and Aztecs -- far fewer have heard of other important groups like the Tarascans, Zapotec, Otomi, and Mixtec. Though these groups may be separated by many hundreds of kilometers and centuries, if not millennia, far too often they are presented as a homogenous melange of anachronisms. Throw in the Andean cultures even further removed, and you get the pop-culture mish-mash that is the [Mayincatec](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mayincatec).

The shallow popular understanding and the seeming strangeness of cultures that developed wholly removed from the influence of Eurasian and African peoples, bolstered by generally poor education on the subject, has led to a number of misconceptions to fill the gaps in knowledge about Mesoamerica. As such, Mesoamerica has been a [frequent topic on AskHistorians](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/nativeamerican) and the reason for this AMA. So please feel free to ask any question, simple or complex, on your mind about this much misunderstood region and its peoples. Ask us about featherwork and obsidian use, long-distance trade, the concept of a *Cultura Madre*, calendrics and apocalypses, pre-Columbian contact hypotheses, actual contact and the early colonial period, human sacrifice and cosmology. Ask us why all of this matters, why we should care about and study these groups so seemingly removed from daily life of most Redditors.

In short, ask us anything.

I'm setting this up now, but I will start answering questions about 12-12:30 EST--have a few things to attend to. I will try to get to all of the questions, even if not all today. :)  


I’m a cultural historian, focusing on two fields: History of the Book and History of Pornography. Specifically, I focus on printed/literary pornography from Early Modern Europe (about 1400 or so) to about 1850  (the term ‘pornography’ was coined in 1849, and laws were passed against it in 1857). My geographical focus is Europe, especially Great Britain, but I also know a good amount about Anthony Comstock and his crusade. In a sense, I deal with the ‘prehistory’ of pornography.  


History of the Book is a much more established field, and has been around since at least the early 1990’s, though with many prefigurations of the field much earlier.

What exactly is the common narrative concerning these events? I have heard two things in particular from the Turkish side: 

* without reducing the significance of the events and their faults, what occurred was ethnic cleansing rather than genocide (this is more semantic than anything else - according to the Turks, Armenian populations were moved to Syria to prevent defection to the Russian Empire in a possible war between the two states. *edit: completely forgot my WWI history, the Ottomans and the Russians were already at war by that stage*); and,

* there was never any actual intent from the Ottoman government or any highly-ranking commanding officers to exterminate Armenian populations, with the deaths that occurred not having been the result of a systematic policy but a widespread racism brought to the fore by the death throes of the empire and a lack of discipline in the field on the part of both soldiers and lowly-ranking COs.

Before the introduction to the topic, I just want to say that I know that this topic can be sensitive to some people and that while I keep myself as unbiased as possible, some readers may take offense at some of my answers that goes against their belief or understanding of a certain conflict, group or event. In particular with the recent conflicts, it can be rather politically charged. I just wanted to put this disclaimer up to let people know.

In the studies of military history, the use of guerrilla warfare and the response to such tactics are often overshadowed by other, contemporary events and field battles. It wasn't until modern time that guerrilla warfare and counterinsurgency has taken the central stage in the annuals of military history. Starting with the Cold War up until the present day conflict in Afghanistan, the refinement of both guerrilla warfare and counterinsurgency have managed to make it both more civilized as well as more brutal - a paradox worth investigating. From the streets of Belfast to the highlands of Vietnam all the way down to the bush country of Mozambique - these wars of irregular tactics and counterinsurgency have led to some of the most unexpected outcomes, horrific crimes and lasting historical personalities. 

Ask about anything related to modern guerrilla warfare and counterinsurgency. To make it even more precise, 1899 up until now would be a good way to measure it properly. I am also qualified to answer questions on modern warfare in general, in particular from the perspective of the ordinary infantryman.

The author's claim is that India was always inclusive, but that the Europeans could not ""understand"" this inclusivity, and decided that India is not actually a single country.  The article quotes John Strachey (but misspells his name):

&gt; This is the first and foremost thing to learn about India that there is not, and never was an India, or even any country of India possessing, according to European ideas, any sort of unity – physical, political, social and religious, no Indian nation, no ‘people of India’, of which we hear so much.

Is there validity to the claim that India was a single inclusive nature of religious and cultural diversity and that the Europeans simply could not understand it, or is this more along the lines of a wishful retelling of history?

Love them, love them, love them.  So with my rather long list of films from all era's I've seen, it's interesting to me to see how acting in the films themselves changed.

Films from the beginning of the ""talkies"" up until about the mid to late 60's have an especially different flavor.  The dialogue is more formal, enunciation is more pronounced, fight scenes are stiffer with more exaggerated moves (the wind up and punch), faces don't seem to be as expressive and the voice seems to carry more expression.  Also the actors seem to be much louder or at least their voices carry a lot of weight behind them.

My personal theory is that many of the actors from that era came from theater, where facial expression is not as important as vocal expression.  Additionally movements had to be more pronounced to be visible to the entire audience.  Additionally, the audio recording equipment of the time was not as high of a quality as it is today requiring the actors be be more formal in their pronunciation.  By the time the late 50's into the 60's and beyond, a new generation of actors and directors had arrived in Hollywood who were more exposed to film than theater, causing them to shift to a more naturalistic style.

Although this is undoubtedly true, it does not provide an explanation.

*The term cobra effect stems from an anecdote set at the time of British rule of colonial India. The British government was concerned about the number of venomous cobra snakes in Delhi.[3] The government therefore offered a bounty for every dead cobra. Initially this was a successful strategy as large numbers of snakes were killed for the reward. Eventually, however, enterprising persons began to breed cobras for the income. When the government became aware of this, the reward program was scrapped, causing the cobra breeders to set the worthless snakes free. As a result, the wild cobra population further increased. The apparent solution for the problem made the situation even worse*

Something very similar happened under French rule in Indochina but with rats instead of snakes. While the rat version of the story seems to have historical proof (though I'm no too sure - my French is a bad joke and I just assumed the sources were good because they looked fancy) I didn't find any for the Cobra version.

This post has three purposes behind it:

1. To give you an account of where we've been, where we are, and where we're going.
2. To thank our subscribers for their submissions and their support.
3. To gauge reader opinion of the weekly project posts and inquire after new possibilities.

It's amazing to think of how far /r/askhistorians has come in the previous year.

In August of 2011, this subreddit received just over 10,000 page views, 2000 of them unique.

In August of 2012, /r/askhistorians blew past ***1,000,000*** page views without even trying, with 225,000 of them unique.

In September of 2012 -- so far -- we have had ~600,000 page views and 260,000 uniques.  ***So far***.  And that's only accounting for the data we currently have... it takes a day or two to update, sometimes.

What makes something like this possible is the constant stream of contributions from you, our subscribers.  You ask questions, provide thoughtful answers, and engage in the kind and caliber of discussion that has provoked approving comment even from those inclined to be scathing.  We're proud that our contributors' work makes frequent appearances in /r/bestof and /r/depthhub, and while we're not as thrilled about occasional appearances in /r/subredditdrama or /r/circlebroke, even those tend to involve the problems at hand being received as the surprising anomalies they are rather than just what's to be expected.

It's been a year fraught with incident.  Things like the ""Bill Sloan"" debacle have taught us skepticism and caution (we hope), while countless instances of popular discussions attracting hundreds -- even thousands -- of new subscribers per day tell us that things are also ticking along as they ought to be.

The moderators have had a hand in all of that, for good or bad, but we rely on our subscribers to produce all of the content that appears, report bad comments, and generally strive to keep the level of discussion in /r/askhistorians as high as one might hope for it to be.  We thank you for all your work.

But our own isn't over, and won't be getting any easier as time goes on.  We are currently in the process of reviewing a number of possible new moderators, and hope to have an announcement to make about that in short order.  In the meantime, your current team is happy to keep on plugging away at it.

All of this is where we are -- but what of the future?

The general popularity of the daily project posts (Tuesday Trivia, Friday Free-for-All, etc.) has more or less spoken for itself, but we'd like your feedback on what you've thought of it all so far and what you might recommend to improve it.

That's all we've got to say just now.

Hey Historians,

Found this book at a garage sale for $5, turns out it's pretty rare and worth about $700 in fair condition. The book is from 1856 and has ~36 uncolored maps of various areas in the United States. The paper (sorry, at the end of the album) is titled ""List of unreturned swamp land"" and has an embossed eagle above the initials ""P&amp;G"". Hope that helps everyone who decides to hop in the Mystery Machine with me.

Thanks everyone for their interest and help!

**Edit**: First of all, great response! Thanks a lot, you guys are great.

Second of all, I was wrong about ""P&amp;G"", it's ""P.&amp;S."" sorry about that. More pics of the paper:

&gt;""Phineas, eldest child of Manassah and Caroline Andrews Ball, was born January 18 1824 in Boylston Massachusetts and is worthy of more than casual mention. In his youth he assisted his father in the labor required in farming. Although physically frail he possessed great energy. He attended the brief terms of the district school until sixteen years of age. Two terms of six weeks each in 1841-2 at Josiah Bride's English boarding school closed his schooling. In the winter of 1840 he spent some weeks with his uncle, who taught him surveying. Equipped with an old compass once the property of his great grandfather, Phineas Ball practiced surveying as opportunity offered, but until his employment by the Nashua and Worcester railroad 1847, he had seen no surveying done by men of experience. He taught several terms of school and finally settled in Worcester. In April 1849 he became associated with Elbridge Boyden under the firm of Boyden &amp; Ball architects and engineers. His field books covering a period of twenty five years show how closely he was identified with the growth of the city. He was an engineer of great ability. He patented a number of appliances used in connection with the construction of water works. He became a member of the Worcester County Mechanics Association serving with great acceptance in the various offices. In 1862-3 he served the city in the common council was mayor in 1865 from 63 to 67 was water commissioner and from 67 to 72 was city engineer. For thirty one years he was deacon of the First Unitarian Church and for seven years president of the Worcester County Conference of Unitarian Churches. He was a member of the Worcester County Society of Engineers and the American Water Works Association and was also a member of the Worcester Society of Antiquity. He was married (first) December 21 1848 to Sarah Augusta Holyoke. Two children were born to them: a son who died in 1857, and a daughter [who] survives.

Hi all!

I've been browsing the /new section of this great subreddit for a while and I've noticed a certain trend - almost every new question posted to this subreddit begins its life with a downvote or two, some of them stay with 0 karma or in the negative even a serious answer to OP's question was posted.

Now, I'm not saying you shouldn't downvote, but there should be a reason for your downvotes: people come into this subreddit to receive answers and learn new things, downvoting a newcomer's post for no reason makes us look like some gated off community on an ivory tower,  which isn't really the purpose of this subreddit.

If a question is too broad (what happened in pre-Colombian America?), ask OP to narrow it down or clarify himself; if a question was asked before (Why do Israel and Palestine fight eachother?), link to the relevant thread; if someone made an error or a fallacy (Why was Italy's army so bad?) explain to him the error of his ways. Don't just downvote and move on without at least giving an explanation, and if you don't feel like doing any of the actions mentioned above, just leave the question there undownvoted.

Also, do not downvote because the question sounds silly or trivial to you - the history of bovine domestication is just as relevant as the social-economical structure of the Soviet union, and not everyone online received the same education as you did. Unless someone is clearly trolling, there's no need to downvote a basic question.

Just after the fall of France there were serious efforts by Germans to negotiate a 'Generous' peace, I don't understand why these were rejected by the British government. The following support the hypothesis:

1.) Allowing the British army to evacuate at Dunkirk without catastrophic losses could be seen as a gesture of 'good will'.

2.) Flight of Rudolph Hess could have been ordered by Hitler with the planned deniability in case his mission failed. 

3.) Even in Mein Kampf and at other times, Hitler expresses his affinity towards the British and shows that he feels that the British Empire has a kinda stabilizing effect on the world.

British ultimately won the war but in effect lost its empire and bankrupted itself. 

**Update**
The above 3 aren't the peace offers but are serious hints to the German desire of peace with British. I have read that there was considerable effort from German side, both before the invasion of Poland and after the fall of France to avoid war/negotiate a peace through back channel talks.  

**Update 2: Hitler's 'generous' peace offer:**

Hitler offered **total cessation of the war in the West**. Germany would evacuate all of France except Alsace and Lorraine, which would remain German. It would evacuate Holland and Belgium, retaining Luxembourg. It would evacuate Norway and Denmark. In short, Hitler offered to withdraw from Western Europe, except for the two French provinces and Luxembourg *[Luxembourg was never a French province, but an independent state of ethnically German origin]*, in return for which Great Britain would agree to assume an attitude of benevolent neutrality towards Germany as it unfolded its plans in Eastern Europe. In addition, the *Führer* was ready to withdraw from Yugoslavia and Greece. German troops would be evacuated from the Mediterranean generally and Hitler would use his good offices to arrange a settlement of the Mediterranean conflict between Britain and Italy. No belligerent or neutral country would be entitled to demand reparations from any other country, he specified.

The proposal contained many other points, including plans for plebiscites and population exchanges where these might be necessitated by shifts in population that has resulted from the military action in Western Europe and the Balkans. But the versions circulating in authoritative circles all agree on the basic points outlined above.

**Disclaimer**
I am still learning and *could be wrong about anything*. The *'generous offer'* this post describes is poorly sourced from lurking in few internet forums(*I told you I am just an amateur!*) and without a proper source **should be considered conjuncture**. To support the hypothesis, I provided the 3 hints towards peace, namely Dunkirk, Hess's flight and Hitler's attitude towards the British from his writings and speeches; but such hints aren't proof.

Here's what little info they know so far:

&gt;MdHS’s records indicate that this photo was taken sometime around 1910. Several pieces of evidence corroborate this date. From the lighting fixtures to the suits and hats the men are wearing, this appears to be the early twentieth century, pre-WWI. Additionally, the original medium for the image is an 8 x 10 inch glass plate negative. Glass negatives preceded film negatives. They first appeared in the mid-nineteenth century, but went the way of the dinosaur in the early twentieth century as less fragile celluloid film was introduced.

Every post must be one of three things, an actual question, an AMA, or a [Meta] post. Anything that is not one of these three things are to be reported and subsequently deleted.

	1A. Questions

Questions should be regarding history, either directly (e.g. What events led up to the War of 1812), or indirectly (e.g. How historically accurate is Assassin’s Creed?). Try to be specific, if you are asking whether Nixon was a “good president” or not, try to define what you mean by good. Try to define a time period if the question is ambiguous. History is typically define as 20 years old or older. Anything newer than this should be reported, and will be judged upon case by case. Also, questions should be about what *did* happen, not what *could have* happened. Questions of that type should be posted in r/historicalwhatif.

	1B. AMAs

AMAs cannot take place except when approved by the moderators. AMAs are for either famous historians (authors, historical directors, etc) or special events (if the Olympics are coming up and you are an expert on the Olympics). Whether or not an AMA is appropriate will be judged upon case by case. Verification of identity will be required, either by a picture of yourself including I.D. and a sign saying, “Hi, r/askhistorians”, or a post on an official twitter/facebook page. Other methods of verification can be discussed if these do not work. 

	1C. [Meta]s

Any post about the workings/policies of the subreddit should be made with a [Meta] tag. Do NOT make a [Meta] post about whether something is allowed or not, just message the moderators for that. [Meta] posts are only appropriate for something that requires a discussion among subscribers.

II. Commenting

There are two types of comments, top-tiered and non top-tiered. Here is a graphic defining what I mean by these terms: http://i.imgur.com/vZveY.png  Both these catagories have different rules.

	2A. Top-Tiered

Top-tiered comments should only be answers to the question at hand. Memes, jokes, insults, or other unhelpful words are not permitted (exceptions may be made for jokes if they are only part of an otherwise informative comment). Sources are *HIGHLY, HIGHLY* recommended, but not absolutely required (other restrictions apply for flaired users—see below). 

	2B. Non Top-Tiered

Comments that are not in the top-tier are much less restricted. Comments should still have a purpose—if they exist for no other reason than to insult someone they may still be deleted, but jokes will more than likely not be deleted.

III. Flair

Flair is for users with an extensive knowledge of a given topic area. Flaired users are held to a higher standard than other users. Flaired users commenting outside their topic area will be treated as normal users. 

	3A. Applying for Flair

Applying for flair takes place in the Panel post, which has a link in the sidebar. In order to be given flair, you must link to three comments you have made in the past displaying your ability to give a helpful answer, including sources. At least one of the comments should be in your given topic area. If you have an obscure specialty, contact the moderators for alternative methods of verification.

	3B. Flaired Expectations

Users with flair must have two things—
1.	An *extensive* knowledge of their topic area, with the ability to cite sources on anything they say in that topic area.
2.	The ability to convey their historical knowledge in a way that is understandable to a person with little-to-no historical background knowledge.
Flaired users which consistently fail to meet these expectations should be reported to the moderators via mod mail.

IV. Banning

	4A. Reasons

You can be banned for repetitively and wantonly violating the in sections one or two. You should receive a warning before an official ban, if you are to be banned for these reasons.

You can also be banned for being a spambot, or consistently reposting to downvote-brigade type subreddits, including but not limited to SRS.

	4B. Appeals

If one of your comments has been wrongfully deleted, or you have been wrongfully banned, you can message the moderators explaining your situation. If you do not feel comfortable messaging the entire moderation team, you can contact me directly.


These rules are subject to change at any time. Questions should be directed toward the mod mail.

Most of it seems to be Waffen SS related.  My great uncle was stationed at Dachau during June of 1945 and I have a dated, postmarked letter from that time and location to his aunt confirming that that is where he obtained these items.  The collection consists of several hundred small items (patches, arm bands and postcards).  Myself, my father and my grandmother would all be interested in identifying them and may be interested in selling some.

Without further ado here's what we came accross:

Flags
The small red one I believe is a general issue flag and not all that rare.  The larger black one I believe may be a Hitler Youth flag based on the design behind the Swastika:

Paper Goods
Half Mark Note 1944 Series and an axis aircraft identification guide written in German and inscribed with a name in the front

http://i.imgur.com/Kx9xghjh.jpg

Arm Bands
For the most part these are in great shape, not very faded and stitched on both ends.  Nederlands and Danmark are the only 2 that appear to be cut.  One of the Adolf Hitler ones seems to be slightly faded, the other is in good shape.  I'm aware the Adolf Hitler ones and the SS-Polizei are pretty valuable but a dollar value would be great.

Postcards
I have over 100 of these.  Some are duplicates, others appear to be parts of a series.  This is a small sample of what I have.  None are written on.  All are in pretty good shape other than being slightly curved from being stored in an envelope.

1359435363.0,198,self.AskHistorians,17h9jl,"This explaination of Africa's relative lack of development throughout history seems dubious. Can you guys provide some insight?
",428,230,672,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/17h9jl/this_explaination_of_africas_relative_lack_of/,"This post was on /r/newright, and apparently it was previously banned from /r/askhistorians. The account appears suspect as it relies primarily on circumstantial evidence and takes a lot of interpretive license. However, history is not my field, and I was wondering if the good folks at /r/askhistorians could (i) shed some light on the shortcomings of this account and (ii) provide a more credible explaination of Africa's developmental stagnation. Here is the original post:


Someone asked ""Why has Sub-Saharan Africa been so historically weak?"", and i did my best to answer the question. The answer seems to have been deleted so I'm reposting it here. It's apparently not acceptable to suggest that environmental differences may lead to genetic differences, which in turn make it difficult to sustain complex civilizations.
Multiple factors appear to play a role in this tragedy:


-The geographic isolation of sub-Saharan Africa also results in genetic isolation. For obvious reasons there has been little population exchange across the Sahara for most of history. Genetic studies show that many beneficial mutations that emerged in Eurasia never reached sub-Saharan Africa. Many of these beneficial mutations are related to personality differences and the formation of complex societies. As an example, the A118G polymorphism which makes people more emotionally sensitive to experiencing social rejection has been under recent positive selection, but is most common in East Asia, relatively common among Europeans, and very rare among sub-Saharan Africans.


-Climatic differences. Seasonal climates tend to be associated with the development of civilization, as such climates require people to plan ahead for the winter, and require men to take care of their children, as the winter is a season in which hunting would be important, which is difficult for women who have young children to take care off. In a warmer climate, women can be largely self-sufficient throughout the year, and women can focus on finding a ""stud"", that is, a man who carries good genes but shows no interest in taking care of a child.


-Lethal diseases, including malaria prevent Africa from developing. Irrigated rice agriculture in Africa would increase malaria transmission, as the mosquito that carries the parasite grows in stagnant water. Most places have no such risk. These differences would also prevent Africa from acquiring many beneficial new mutations carried by immigrants (such as A118G), as immigrants do not have the genetic adaptations to survive in an environment that hosts malaria.


-The founder effect in non-Africans. The founder effect is believed to play a major role in speciation. Homo Floriensis shows that humans are no exception to this rule. According to Wikipedia, it has been estimated that from a population of 2,000 to 5,000 individuals in Africa, only a small group, possibly as few as 150 to 1,000 people, crossed the Red Sea. Today Africa is still the continent with the largest human genetic diversity on the planet.

Non-African groups can therefore be expected to have shed certain genetic polymorphisms that still occur in sub-Saharan Africans and can destabilize a society. The most important thing for civilization is internal social cohesion. Genetic polymorphisms that are still common in Africa such as MAOA-2R make it difficult to maintain internal social cohesion, as these cause violent behavior. Similarly, haplogroup D of the microcephalin gene which regulates brain size has spread throughout the world, except to sub-Saharan Africa. At this moment it is not yet known what the effects of this polymorphism are, but we do know that this gene has been under significant positive selection. Similarly, new derived versions of ASPM related to tone perception did not spread to sub-Saharan Africa.


-Some believe that Arab slave trade before contact with Europeans may have played a role, but this does not answer the question, it merely raises the question of what enabled the Arabs to exploit the sub-Saharan Africans, as opposed to the other way around.

Please take a look, and let us know below if you have any questions or comments.

N.B.  There's nothing in here that will be completely novel or unanticipated by the previous rules, but readers will note that II(a) and II(c) contain guidelines that have only been implicit up until now.

=-=-=-=

**I. Submissions**

Every submission in /r/askhistorians must be one of five things:

- An actual question
- A [META] post
- An AMA post
- A daily project post
- A special occasion post

**Questions** are just that: questions.  Users should make every effort to ensure that their questions are clear, specific and novel.  The more tightly-focused your question, the more likely you are to get an answer.  ""Did Blackbeard really wear burning brands in his beard?"" is great; ""Tell me something about pirates!"" is... not.  Anyone may post a question.

**[META] posts** are about the state and process of the subreddit; e.g. ""[META] We need to talk about downvotes""; ""[META] We now have 40,000 subscribers!""; etc.  Anyone may make a [META] post.  Please only make such posts about things that actually invite or require discussion.

**AMA posts** are mod-approved ""ask me anything"" submissions from flaired users, along the same lines as those featured in /r/IAmA.  In these submissions, the user in question makes him- or herself available to answer questions provided by our readers about the user's area of expertise.  Only flaired users may make AMA posts, and only with mod approval.

**Daily project posts** are those catch-all posts that appear each day of the week on [the schedule determined here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/x9c4e/meta_new_projects_incoming/).  Only mods may make them.

**Special occasion posts** draw attention to an occurrence or anniversary that would serve as good grounds for general discussion.  [See an example here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/y94fc/special_occasion_post_243rd_birthday_of_napoleon/).  Such posts can be about anniversaries, museum openings, exciting discoveries -- anything that's a legitimately big deal and likely to be of interest to /r/askhistorians' readers.  Anyone can make a special occasion post, but **only after receiving mod approval**.

If a submission in /r/askhistorians does not fit into one of the five above categories, it will very likely be deleted.

**I(a). Further Question Guidelines**

Questions should be historical, either directly (e.g. ""What events led up to the War of 1812""), or indirectly (e.g. ""How historically accurate is Assassin’s Creed?"").  They may also be about historical method (e.g. ""How should we deal with the biases in primary sources?"") or the ""world of history"" more generally (e.g. ""What are the major collections, archives and museums in your field of research?""). 

Try to be specific; if you are asking whether Nixon was a “good president” or not, try to define what you mean by ""good"". 

Try to define a time period if the question is ambiguous. For the purpose of discouraging too much speculation about current events, we request that users in /r/askhistorians confine themselves to questions about events taking place prior to 1992.  This twenty-year window is not without its complications, but we wish to keep the comments in /r/askhistorians focused on events that have already had a chance to become more or less settled.

Anything focused on events after 1992 should be reported to the moderating team, and will be judged on a case-by-case basis. 

Additionally:

- Questions should be about what did happen, not what could have happened. Questions of that type should be posted in /r/historicalwhatif.

- While we welcome questions about mysterious objects you may have found, you should also try asking about them in /r/whatisthisthing.  They have a much better track record!

- Might your question be more appropriate for /r/asksocialscience?  They'd be glad to receive it, if so.

- Book reviews and requests for same might fruitfully be directed to /r/historyresources/.

**II. Commenting**

There are two types of comments: *top-tiered* and *non-top-tiered*. [Here is a graphic](http://i.imgur.com/vZveY.png) showing what is meant by these terms.  Each type of comment is governed by different rules.

**II(a). Top-Tiered Comments**

Top-tiered comments should *only* be serious responses to whatever the thread is about.  If it's a question, they must be answers; if an AMA, solid questions; if one of the other types, worthwhile points of discussion.  In all cases, it is permitted to ask additional questions to clarify the OP's submission or to follow it up. 

Memes, jokes, insults, or other unhelpful comments are *not permitted*, though exceptions may be made for jokes if they are only part of an otherwise informative comment.  The answers provided in /r/askhistorians should be informed, comprehensive, serious and courteous -- that is, they should be such that a reader would depart feeling as though he or she had actually learned something.

Sources in top-tiered comments are not an absolute requirement at first if the comment is sufficiently comprehensive, but users who choose to answer questions in /r/askhistorians must take responsibility for the answers they provide.  If you are asked for sources or further substantiation, you are required to make a good-faith effort to find and provide them. This subreddit's entire point is to answer questions that are set before you; if you are not prepared or inclined to substantiate your claims when asked, please think twice before answering in the first place.

**II(b). Non-Top-Tiered Comments**

Comments that are not in the top-tier are less restricted.

Non-top-tiered comments should still have a positive purpose -- if they exist for no other reason than to insult someone they will still be deleted.  Nevertheless, non-top-tiered comments have greater scope for jokes, digressions and so on, and will be moderated with a somewhat lighter hand.

**II(c). On Speculation**

We welcome informed, helpful answers from any users equipped to provide them, whether they have flair or not. Nevertheless, while this is a public forum it is not an egalitarian one; not all answers will be treated as having equal merit. Please ensure that you only post answers that you can substantiate, if asked, and only when you are certain of their accuracy. 

It is perfectly acceptable to ask a follow-up question of your own if you aren't sure about something, or wish to generate further discussion, but *please make sure to frame your comment explicitly in those terms if so*.

**II(d). Posts from Novelty Accounts and Bots**

Bots will be banned on sight, no matter how benign.  We are not interested in 'em.

Users may post from novelty accounts provided they do not do so ""in-character.""  This applies both to accounts with a particular gimmick (only posts one word, gradually revealed to be something, etc.) or accounts intentionally modeled upon famous persons.  In-character posting will result first in a warning, then in a ban.

**III. Flair**

Flair is for users with an extensive knowledge of a given topic area.  The different sub-sections of flair can be found in the coloured list in the sidebar.

**III(a). Applying for Flair**

Applying for flair takes place in the current Panel post, which has a link in the sidebar. Consult that post for the current rules governing applications.

**III(b). Flaired Expectations**

Users with flair must have two things:

1. An extensive knowledge of their topic area, with the ability to cite sources on anything they say in that topic area. 

2. The ability to convey their historical knowledge in a way that is understandable to a person with little-to-no historical background knowledge. 

Flaired users are held to a higher standard.  They must be polite, helpful, and comprehensive in every comment they make.  They are permitted to answer questions outside of their area of expertise, but they will be treated just like any other user when they do so.

Flaired users who fail to meet the above expectations should be reported to the moderators.

**III(c). Non-Flaired Expectations**

We welcome the participation of non-flaired users so long as it conforms to all of the above rules.  It is especially important for us to allow such participation given that it is one of the chief ways in which we can find out which non-flaired users should be given flair at all.  Nevertheless, pay special attention to the strictures provided above when it comes to sources and speculation.

It is true that /r/askhistorians is not a peer-reviewed journal or graduate seminar, but we are *severely and grimly uninterested* in seeing these facts held up as reasons why you don't need to take responsibility for the things you've posted.

**III(d). Conduct for All Users**

Regardless of flair, all users are expected to behave with courtesy and charity.  We also have a very low tolerance for racism, sexism, or other forms of bigotry, no matter your credentials.

**IV. Discipline**

Those who break the rules outlined above will likely find themselves under scrutiny.  Disciplinary actions on the moderators' part come in three forms:

- Gentle reminders
- Formal warnings
- Bannings

**Gentle reminders** will see a moderator suggesting you shift your tone, improve your posting style, or what have you, but without any suggestion of the matter being especially severe.

**Formal warnings** will be delivered for especially grievous infractions, and are marked by their inclusion of a serious, declarative command; e.g. ""Do not post like this again.""  Users who receive multiple warnings will likely be banned.

**Bannings** are reserved for users who:

- Commit multiple infractions in spite of warnings and correction
- Respond with hostility and rudeness to attempts to warn them (**note: this does not mean you can't respond at all; we're quite open to being asked why warnings or reminders have been handed out -- just be courteous about it!)
- Are clearly trolls
- Engage unrepentantly in racist, sexist, or otherwise bigoted behaviour
- Are spammers
- Are bots -- even relatively benign ones

**IV(b). Appeals**

If one of your comments has been wrongfully deleted, or if you feel you have been wrongfully banned, you can message the moderators either individually or as a team to explain your situation.

These rules are subject to change at any time, though such changes will be publicly announced. Questions should be directed toward the mod mail.

The moderators will be discussing this, and we will be commenting shortly.

**Edit**

I'll go ahead and make a statement since I was the one putting myself out there.

Yes, *we* should have vetted better.  Next time (if there is a next time), an AMA occurs, we will require the poster to send a picture with their name on it and a mention of /r/askhistorians.

Yes, *we* got suckered.  I'm not alone in this as far as the moderators go with letting this happen, I just happened to be the most active one promoting and participating in it.

*I* apologize for letting this happen.

There will be an increased amount of vigilance in this subreddit.  We have 20,000+ users now, and 3 moderators is simply not enough. 

*No I am not going to step down as mod.*  Yes, I'm inexperienced at moderating, and I had to learn somehow.  I consider this a hard learned lesson, and will use it as a way to get better.  I promise something like this will never happen again.

If you see something suspicious that sounds trollish please message the moderators or me specifically, and I will address this issue.

I do not want to see any ""I told you so's,"" about anything.  Many of us were suckered by this, I was overwhelmed trying to keep things under control and was personally shocked by what was occurring.  I could not maintain constant vigilance on this thread because I had other things occurring IRL at the same time, so by the time things were happening, I was reacting. 

My reactions to the LGBT comments was offense, but respectful.  I myself am a member of the LGBT community, and while I found much of what was being said offensive, I felt that with this subs policy of open commenting and respect for opinion it would be unfair to censor what I thought were actual comments from real people.  At the same time, I apologize to those who took offense and objected and I tried to squelch that line of commentary.  I was trying to keep the AMA on topic and flowing the right way.  In this I was mistaken, and I fully apologize.

*I* apologize to Mr. Sterling for this.  He actually thought he was speaking to two people he knew IRL.  I sent him a personal apology for this.

**agentdcf's comment**

&gt;My thoughts, and mine alone. These do not represent the entire moderator team, as we haven't had time to really discuss this.
This is a compliment. We have made the Big Leagues, and we're now big and noteworthy enough to be worth trolling.
This was a growing pain. We did not do our due diligence in vetting the account. In the future, we will require much more thorough documentation. When this account contacted us, it did not really occur to me that someone could be trolling us. Why, after all? What's at stake here aside from the goodwill of a community? Of course, that was my real-world brain thinking, and not my internet brain. On the internet, there's always someone willing to troll purely for the sake of it. Well, the lesson has been learned. This is now a thing, and I think we can certainly expect to be trolled again in the future, and we will be much more vigilant.

I'm Benerson Little, and I'll be around all day to answer questions on piracy and pirate hunting from antiquity to the present. I've written several books on piracy, ranging from scholarly works on sea roving tactics, Caribbean piracy, and the general history of piracy and pirate hunting, to a couple of more general works on famous pirates and sea rovers, and the myths associated with piracy. I'm open to any questions on this very broad subject, and will do my best to answer them in a manner both detailed and succinct, if such is possible. (I can be long-winded,  I'm told.) 

My interest in the subject began when I read Treasure Island at ten and Captain Blood a few years later, and continued through the years I served as a Navy SEAL. This service was the inspiration for my first book, for it gave me firsthand insight into unconventional tactics at sea and I was able to compare them with sea rovers of the past. However, my interest in piracy and pirate hunting ranges far beyond tactics, from the causes and effects of piracy to its suppression to how piracy has been depicted in literature and film.

Anyway, please ask away! I'll answer as many questions as I can. If I don't happen to know the answer, I'll do my best to suggest possible sources or other avenues where an answer might be found.

EDIT: 5:20 p.m. CDT, I'm going to do my best to answer the remaining questions tonight or tomorrow morning, but am taking a break now for a little while. Great questions, by the way!

I'll keep this brief but my particular research areas are the early and high European Middle Ages (roughly 750-1250 CE), though I teach anything related to the Mediterranean World between 300-1600. I'm particulary interested in religious and intellectual history, how memory relates to history, how legend works, and justifications for sacred violence. But I'm also pursuing research on the relations between Jews and Christians, both in the Middle Ages and today (that weird term ""Judeo-Christianity""), and echoes of violent medieval religious rhetoric in today's world. In a nutshell, I'm fascinated by how ideas make people do things. 

So, ask me anything about the Crusades, medieval apocalypticism, kingship, medieval biblical commentary in the Middle Ages, the idea of ""Judeo-Christianity,"" why I hate the 19th century, or anything else related to the Middle Ages.

Justinian recaptured Italy in the fourth century. Why did he not take San Marino while he was at it?

Italy was a bunch of divided microstates for centuries. Why did none of them ever pick it off?

When Napoleon was tearing Italy up, why did he leave San Marino alone?

When Piedmont Sardinia formed the Italian nation in the 1850s and 60s, why did they annex every nation in the region of Italy EXCEPT San Marino?

When Mussolini was in charge, why didn't he just roll a few tanks into the tiny republic and trump it up for some good propaganda?

Here's the idea:

A profile gives a flaired user a space to add...whatever they want (within reason and relevance). Right now, they're being used to host a mini autobiography, showcase a user's best answers, and provide recommended reading, among other utilities. They are open for flaired users to experiment with, meaning we might get some more interesting developments in coming weeks.

This policy has been implemented to better fulfill our sub's written goal: for historians and other people who are knowledgeable about history to provide informed and well-researched answers to historical questions. We hope that these profiles will be used to publicly provide visible academic profiles for our flaired users, to demonstrate their expertise, and to serve as a hive of links for their research area.

These profiles are restricted to our users with flair. If you have flair and would like to create a profile, either message the mods or myself directly and we can get you set up with one, as well as a template to work from.

&gt;When the Tuareg rebels first arrived in Timbuktu in April, they looted and burned many government buildings, and the institute’s interim director, Abdoulaye Cissé, worried that the institute’s sleek new library building would become a target.

&gt;But when the Islamist rebels arrived a few days later, the library’s officials explained to them that the library was an Islamic institution worthy of their protection.

&gt;“One of the Islamist leaders gave his mobile phone number to the guard and told him, ‘If anyone bothers you, call me and I will be here,’ ” he said.

&gt;But library officials began to worry that the Islamists would discover that the library received financing from the United States, so in August they decided to move almost the entire collection, Mr. Cissé said.

&gt;“We moved them little by little to avoid rousing suspicion,” Mr. Cissé said. They were sent to Mopti, then on to Bamako, the capital, for safekeeping.

&gt;It turned out the worries were not unwarranted. In the chaotic final days of the Islamist occupation, all that changed. A group of militants stormed the library as they were fleeing and set fire to whatever they could find.

&gt;Fortunately, they got their hands on only a tiny portion of the library’s collection.

&gt;“They managed to find less than 5 percent,” he said. “Thank God they were not able to find anything else.”

At the time he was managing a construction project in the city of Lahore, Pakistan around the Lahore Fort where a bunch of these old coins were found hidden inside a clay pot. He asked me to hold on to these and I still have them all. I have never got them dated or anything, they have just been sitting inside this pouch in a suitcase.

They are made of some pliable metal (gray base you see on the coins), not exactly sure which metal. However, they are plated in some gold color metal, which is not very well coated. Some of the coins don't have that coating anymore.

Front of the coin: There is what seems to me as some very very old Indian goddess on the front of the coin. He/She is holding a trident in one hand and MAYBE a sword of some sort in the other.

Back of the coin: There is nothing there, its just the same pliable metal, mostly in gold color.

A few questions: 
1. How do I get these dated? Are there any places in Arizona?
2. Has anyone ever seen anything similar to this before?
3. Can someone provide some more information on these?

I personally think that these are Pre-Mughal era coins and based on the material used for the coins, they could even be up to 2000 years old, but I could be wrong.

*Edit after 5 month: Read a bit of Modern world, completed Iron Kingdom, Why the West rules for now, the Great Divergence and looked into China A History, as well as Orientalism and the Power Broker. It is much harder to read some works because they are very dense (looking at Pomeranz. However, I have to say that it is quite interesting and changed how I look on the state of affairs. Why the West rules, for now is an excellent introduction piece.*

Quoting from a post I made in /r/cryptography:
&gt;The SOE, who the internet suspects sent the message, used double transpositions, but a letter frequency analysis suggests that there was at least a monoalphabetic cipher used as well (thank you Fark). It can't be a traditional Playfair, because it uses the entire alphabet. However, other playfair ciphers do exist--3x9, 6x6, etc.

Is there any indication that the SOE, Bomber Command, or any related divisions of the British Military during WWII would have used a cypher like that?

We have gained over 4,000 subscribers in the since the weekend. Although the sidebar provides a quick overview, I now find it necessary to provide this brief history of this subreddit, as well as the way we expect you to conduct yourself.

This subreddit was started by me, Artrw. I am not a professional historian. In fact, I am currently a high school student, taking an AP U.S. History class (that I probably ought to be studying for). Though I do not plan to pursue a career in history, it is pretty intriguing to me.

Another thing you should probably know about me is I’m pretty libertarian. I think that freedom of speech is a genuinely good idea. Sadly, it seems some of you are pretty intent on proving me on. Regardless, this subreddit’s moderation is very, *very* minimal. As you can see by our sidebar, the only two things that warrant a full-on post deletion are advertisements, or posts that are not a historical question (unless it’s a [meta] thread discussing the nature of the subreddit). Keep in mind, if you are browsing the subreddit and see a comment that you think is in bad taste, please just downvote and move on. The mods are not interested in hearing about it, just downvote the post to hell. You can even comment a little reminder to maintain decorum if you so please, but unless it is advertent spam, don’t bother reporting it. I’m just going to accept it.

Not making racist, sexist, etc. remarks seems like common sense. However, we here at r/askhistorians like to hold ourselves to a higher standard than lots of other subreddits. I’m not going to lie and say I don’t enjoy memes or pun chains, but this subreddit is not the place (again: don’t report, just downvote). If you must be a smartass, r/shittyaskhistorians *does* exist. 

However, please keep in mind that the above only applies to *normal* comments. Comments made by people with a tag (or, as it’s otherwise known, flair) are hold to a higher standard. Please message the mods (not the report button, but send a private message), if you see a tagged member making a post that contains undeniably false information or antagonistic remarks. We won’t ban the member or delete the comment, but we will revoke their flair. We’ve done it before and we’ll do it again. 

This is certainly not a final list of guidelines. Just use common sense.

When we debate, we must do so while refraining from insults, cursing, attitudes, and chips on the shoulder.  I myself will sometimes slip, as most of us will due to frustration, but a continued record of antagonism, insults, and cursing at others will result in action by the moderators.

Everyone is here because this is subs goal is to achieve a higher standard of discussion of history.  It won't always be perfect as Artfw and I do not want to delete, censor, or ban-hammer, our way through this sub; that's not what we are here for.  I have added another bullet point to the sidebar: no name calling, no insults.  I expect a few frustrated exclamations from time to time, but calling someone an ""asshole"" for example is simply not allowed.

Going forward, I hope to have this be such a rare event that it is a huge deal to have to take action.

Thank you for your time.

What happened to the essays after the examination process? Were they published ever? Kept in a restricted archive? Were there famous exam answer essays used as examples?

How long would you have to study for the exam? Would candidates devote all time to study or could they hold down a job as well? Realistically did candidates from poor backgrounds stand a chance?

We officially start at 7pm EDT, (US EDT).

Let me introduce the Chinese traditions Mini-Panel and what we can talk about: 

/u/lukeweiss can cover the Daoist tradition, with roots back to the early texts and particularly the ""religious"" developments after the 2nd Century CE. My specialty is Tang (618-907 CE) Daoism, however I will do my best to answer all general Daoism questions. I holds an MA in Chinese History.
Before you ask, and to give you a light-hearted introduction to Daoism, enjoy [this FAQ, from notable scholar Steven R. Bokenkamp](http://public.wsu.edu/~paths/bokenkamp-faq.html). Or just ask away!!  

/u/FraudianSlip can talk about both the early texts of the Dao and the early confucian texts. He specializes in Song (960-1279 CE) intellectual history. FraudianSlip will begin an MA in Chinese History in the Fall. [see FraudianSlips's profile HERE!](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/profiles/fraudianslip)

/u/Grass_Skirt can talk about Chan [Zen] historiography, late Ming Buddhism, the Arhat cult, iconography and art history, book culture, Buddhist-Daoist syncretism.  He is a PhD candidate with a background in Sinology. He is your go-to on the panel for Buddhism in China.  

lastly, if we are lucky, /u/coconutskull will join us, he specializes in Buddhist history as well.  

So, these are remarkable traditions that span what we call ""religion"" and ""philosophy"" and often challenge those very words as definitions. We are really excited to see what ya'all are curious about!  

Please fire away!   

EDIT: I (/u/lukeweiss) will be taking a very short break, be back in about an hour, so I apologize to unanswered queries, you are not forgotten! I will return!  

EDIT II: So, my goose is cooked. Your questions were really outstanding! I am so happy with the quality of the questions, and a special thanks must go to the fantastic answers of fraudianSlip and Grass_Skirt.

But downvoting a question is *actively reducing* the chance that it will get answered. We feel that there's no good reason to go that far. If a question isn't related a history, or it breaks one of our few other rules for questions (no ""what ifs"", no ""polls""), then the policy has always been that it should be reported and deleted.

So we've decided to trial disallowing downvotes for questions. For the next couple of weeks, the downvote button will be removed in the default subreddit style (this is easy to circumvent, but we hope the majority will respect the new rule regardless). We hope to see fewer good questions languishing unanswered in the new queue. If so, we'll consider making it a permanent change. It will also inform an ongoing behind-the-scenes discussion on further changes to the subreddit style, aimed at promoting high quality comments and upvoting/downvoting for the right reasons (any ideas on this are welcome).
