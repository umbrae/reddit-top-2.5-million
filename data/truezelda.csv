1368389774.0,90,self.truezelda,1e78e0,The Hero of Time as a Tragic Character,99,9,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/truezelda/comments/1e78e0/the_hero_of_time_as_a_tragic_character/,"The following is an analysis/discussion on the character of the Link that appears in Ocarina of Time and Majora’s Mask. 

I’m not necessarily referring to him as a tragic character in the Shakespearean sense (a character whose downfall is the fault of his own attributes) but rather in the traditional sense of the word: as a particularly sympathetic character, with arguably the saddest and most unfair fates of all of the Links. 

- In terms of origin, this Link had a rough start to life and a marred childhood. His parents were killed before he knew them, the other Kokiri –aside from Saria- ostracized him, and he later had to realise that the first 10 years of his life were, essentially, a lie. The death of his father figure thrusts him into his adventure, and during his quest some other notable characteristics and cruel fates await him.

- On his journey, I noticed that this Link appears to have a lonely and reclusive personality, possibly as a result of his outsider status even amongst the Kokiri. His lack of ability to interact with other people reasonably is evident in his running away from almost all signs of affection or social interaction – for example the Gorons, Princess Ruto, Cremia in Majora’s Mask, and his lack of participation in the festival from the same game. While all of the Links were required to witness certain horrors, this Link had just about everything he loved taken from him by the end of his games. All of the friends he had made in OoT became sages, and Zelda herself had to send him away. He could not return to the forest home he once knew. Navi left him. His good deeds in Termina go without reward, and possibly never truly noticed.

I’m actually extremely impressed by this Link’s determination despite his ‘terrible fate’. Where SS Link seemed loving and TP Link had tenacity, this Link seems far more reserved, helping others with no request for anything in return.

- This Link’s fate after his adventures may be the saddest aspect of all. He has 3 outcomes: to die in discontent and linger, for his efforts to last only a while until Hyrule is flooded whilst the people cry for him, or for him to fail and his death lead to a new timeline. Imagine if this Link was somehow aware of all 3 timelines? No wonder he may be absolutely discontent in death. 

He was first a boy trapped in an adult’s body, witnessing what no child should have to see, then an adult in a child’s body. It would also not surprise me if he had severe PTSD. 

For these reasons, I believe this Link died prematurely in the Child Timeline. My own personal thoughts are that he grew up, yes, and as a young adult his complete sense of altruism is what caused his demise, riddled with absolute discontent at not being able to be…a hero to all, I suppose. I imagine he died protecting or helping someone else as he’d always done, and his ache for helping others lead to an early death, as he would not seem content with merely settling down. I own and am aware that Hyrule Historia suggests that TP Link and OoT Link are related; however the word descendant can be interpreted loosely, since we know through SS that every Link is technically a descendant or successor to the last, by carrying the same Spirit of the Hero. To me, it is more gripping, and makes more sense with regards to his character that OoT Link attaches so strongly to TP Link of his consuming desire to help others, help Hyrule, and help his successor. Calling him ‘my child’ strengthens his lamentation of not having children, and living vicariously through his successor.

So, there’s my essay of analysis regarding OoT Link. What are your thoughts? What have you taken away/ noticed/ speculated with regards to his character from both the games and supplementary material?

During said time, I tried an experiment I had always wanted to do, but never did because I'm not too bright at math. I timed Ocarina's day and night schedule (from cock crow 'til wolf howl) and a day of Hyrulian time equals approximately 5:30, four minutes of day and a minute and a half of night. 

Like I said, I was never the best mathematician, so I asked a friend for help. This is what he told me:

A direct conversion Hyrule - to - Earth would be :

(5 min * 60 s/min) + (30s) = 330 s / day

(330 s / day) / (24 hr / day) =  13.75 s / hr

So 13.75 seconds Hyrule time corresponds to 1 hour Earth time. However, that also leads to the conclusion that Hyrule has unchanging days which are (4 min * 60 s / 13.75 s) = about 17 1/2 hours long, and nights which are only (90 s / 13.75 s) = about six and a half hours long. This is entirely possible (you have day/night cycles like that in Alabama in the summer, for instance) but would imply a planet which, like Earth, has an axial tilt (the planet's axis is tilted relative to its sun, which is why the days and nights aren't equal in length) - and if you have a planet with axial tilt, you have a planet in which the length of daylight vs dark would change over the course of the year (like they do on Earth.) You'd also have seasons for the same reason.

However, since the game appears to have unchanging day/night lengths, we might instead assume that (since, so far as I know, you don't have to sit and watch Link sleep for roughly 1/3 of the game) the time you are playing represents all of his waking hours - so the fact that you have nearly three times as much daylight as nighttime corresponds to a standard diurnal schedule, in which most of your waking hours correspond to when the sun is up, with only a few waking hours when the sun is down. In this case, if we assume Link has eight hours a day of off-camera sleeping/eating/bodily functions/etc, then the in-game time represents only 16 hours, not 24. In that case, every 20.625 seconds Hyrule time corresponds to an hour Earth time, and Link has about 11 1/2 hours of sunshine and a little more than four and a half hours of nighttime in which he's up and active. The other eight hours Earth time pass while he steps out to the little elf's room, or sleeps, or whatever, which the game mercifully skips.",,False,,t5_2tfzp,False,,,True,t3_1bbnko,http://www.reddit.com/r/truezelda/comments/1bbnko/hyrule_time_vs_earth_time/,

What if the end of ALttP occurred *solely* within the Sacred Realm.  Specifically, both OoT and ALttP talk about the Sacred Realm changing to reflect the heart of the person who touches the Triforce.  When Ganon touched the Triforce, the Sacred Realm became the Dark World, which was a reflection of Ganon's heart.

My theory is that when Link touched the Triforce at the end of ALttP, the Sacred Realm once again changed forms to reflect Link's heart.  If this is true, then everything we saw in the ending credits--the king returning, Link's uncle still being alive, all of Link's new friends living happy, fulfilling lives--may have been part of the Sacred Realm.  In this sense, when Link touched the Triforce, the Sacred Realm may have become a ""Golden World"" where all of Link's wishes were true, and the ""real"" world may have been unaffected.

This would have dramatic consequences.  If this idea is true, then at the end of ALttP, the ""real"" world would still be without a king.  More than that, since Link's uncle is still dead, and Link is in his own Golden World, the ""real"" world would also be without a hero.

So far, we know that ALbW contains a light world and a dark world.  I think it would be fascinating if, flipping ALttP on its head, the Light World were the Sacred Realm--created by Link at the end of ALttP--and the Dark World were the ""real"" world that had degraded and turned into a wasteland over the years without a king or hero.

After reading [these theories](http://www.flyingomelette.com/oddities/z64theories.html) about the development process of Ocarina of Time and how the game changed during the development process, I began to wonder whether the fact that the fire-themed bosses, King Dodongo and Volvagia, have their own theme could hint at another story-line that was ""lost"" before the game was finished. Why wouldn't the forest-themed or water-themed bosses have their own theme? Why not give every boss their own theme?  
  
The only explanation that I could come up with was that Death Mountain is traditionally an end-game area; so, perhaps at one point during development, King Dodongo and Volvagia were penultimate/antepenultimate bosses. I have no real evidence to back this up, though. Anyone have any hints?

As I think about it, one of the huge factors is the balance between having a wide open world without any instructions (Zelda I) and completely holding your hand and not letting you figure out anything for yourself (SS). 

The downside to the Zelda I way is that it can become quite frustrating. I remember poring over Nintendo Power and Strategy Guides with my brother before we could figure out the original Zelda. But I feel in today's internet age, it would be much better to err on the side of wide-open, no hand-holding. 

So with that said, here's a quick ranking of the console Zeldas based solely on Adventure! 

*(I haven't played Zelda II or Four Swords so I have to abstain from including those).*

1. Wind Waker - we can debate ad nauseum about the sailing, it simply comes down to a matter of taste. I absolutely loved it. Having a wide open sea and a chance to discover every little island was the perfect sweet spot for me.

2. A Link to the Past - I didn't play this when I was young, so it's missing the nostalgia I have with others, but I felt it capture the wide-openness of Zelda I without as much ""burn every bush"" tactics. Big beautiful world with lots of secrets, and basically no hand-holding.

3. Ocarina of Time - I will forever remember the moment, playing on my friend's N64, when I first came out onto Hyrule Field. He pointed at Death Mountain waaaaaay off in the distance and said, ""See that mountain? We get to actually *go* there."" My first real experience with 3d gaming (other than Wolfenstein), and my mind was completely blown.

4. Zelda I - I already mentioned my memories playing with my brother. More than any other Zelda, it really feels like you've just been plopped down and told ""Go!"" Just figuring out what to do is a puzzle in itself and requires so much exploration. 

5. Twilight Princess - What we dreamt of for so long: a massive, humongous world. But it was so sparse. I remember spending a half hour swimming around Lake Hylia thinking, ""there are going to be *so* many secrets here."" I found nothing. 

6. Majora's Mask - Don't get me wrong, I loved the game, but I don't think adventure was its strongest suit. At every point in the game, there is a very specific destination and that's basically all that you can do. One of the great strengths of MM, its side quests, really helps so that you don't feel like you're on rails, but most of the side quests, for me, didn't provide the adventure I was looking for.

7. Skyward Sword - Fi. No real overworld. The sky could have been so great and it felt even more sparse than TP (I remember thinking ""well, once I get into that huge storm cloud, *then* it'll really open up"" Nope). The ways future sections of the map are kept closed feels more and more arbitrary as we go farther along in Zelda. In Zelda I, its because you don't have the ladder. Makes sense. In WW, its KoRL telling you ""don't go there."" And by SS, you have to place a tablet to make a beam shoot up through the clouds. 

Adventure can mean many different things to people. So that's just how I see it. What about you?",,False,,t5_2tfzp,False,,,True,t3_1544y2,http://www.reddit.com/r/truezelda/comments/1544y2/which_zelda_has_had_the_greatest_sense_of/,

The ""Divine Prank"" refers to the fact that when Ganondorf was executed in TP, he had the mark of the Triforce of Power on his hand, which allowed him to survive the execution.  Instead, he was banished to the Twilight Realm.  Fans have debated precisely why these events occurred.

Some fans have argued that Ganondorf did NOT possess the Triforce of Power, because TP occurs in the child timeline, in which Ganondorf was prevented from entering the Sacred Realm and obtaining the Triforce.  From this viewpoint, the Triforce mark merely meant that Ganondorf was somehow chosen or blessed by the gods, even though he didn't have the Triforce of Power.

Well, the Historia clears up the mystery.  On pages 110-113, the Historia states that when Zelda returned Link to the past at the end of OoT, the Triforce of Courage stayed with him (pg. 110).  The Historia doesn't detail precisely how or why, but it does say that this event caused Ganondorf to possess the Triforce of Power in the childhood timeline, despite never entering the Sacred Realm or touching the Triforce (pg. 113).

Based on this confirmation, there are two possible explanations.  I've proposed in the past that events in one timeline affect the others.  Thus, the Triforce splitting in the adult timeline also caused it to split in the childhood timeline.

The other, somewhat more complex explanation I've seen is that when Zelda sent Link back to the past at the end of OoT, she sent the Triforce of Courage with him (confirmed by the Historia).  This creates a paradox where one timeline has 4 Triforce Pieces (2x Courage, 1x Power and Wisdom), and the other timeline has only 2 pieces (only Power and Wisdom).  To fix this paradox, basically the Adult Courage piece returned to the Adult timeline, and the Childhood Triforce split, so that childhood Link would still have the Triforce of Courage in his possession.  The splitting then caused the Triforces of Power and Wisdom to go to Ganondorf and Zelda, respectively.

**TL;DR: The Hyrule Historia confirms that childhood Link had the Triforce of Courage, which also gave Ganondorf the Triforce of Power in the childhood timeline.

Most of the games take place during a period of technological decline. From the hookshot to the pegasus boots, we're always finding the relics from the bygone days of ingenuity. I've always wondered about where the pinnacle of technology was in the series, and Skyward Sword has given the strongest answer yet with robots equipped with artificial intelligence. So, isn't it possible that everything that's ""magic"" about the series, is really technology advanced far beyond our understanding? I'm pretty sure we've had this discussion on here before. But rather than waste our time debating about if it could or couldn't be true, I'd rather just have fun trying to see how much of the magic we could explain as technology. So here goes, I will start my list and then edit it with your ideas as we go along.

1) Teleportion - Quite possibly the most common 'magic' seen in the series. No elaboration necessary, I mean...it's teleportation.

2) Time Travel - Also pretty self explanatory. Lots of science.

3) Lens of Truth - X- ray device.

4) Nayru's Love/Magic Armour/Cane of Byrna - Force field.

5) Power bracelet/glove - Anti-gravity generators.

6) Fire/Ice abilities (arrows, Din's fire, etc) - Extreme temperature manipulation using chemical reactions.

7) Dominion Rod - Another self explanatory one. Practically screams technology posing as magic.

As a result, I missed out on Skyward Sword's release. Being a lifelong, hardcore Zelda fan, it was the first thing I bought when I came home, and I had beaten it within a week. I knew next to nothing about it (having been essentially removed from pop culture for two years), save that it used motion controls and that you could fly. I had heard various reviews about it. My friend sent me a snippet of IGN's review, which called it the best game of the decade and that ""Ocarina of Time has met its match."" I thought, with joy, that Nintendo had returned to form with Zelda, having been slightly disappointed by Twilight Princess (which, don't get me wrong, *is* a fantastic game that I plan to replay soon). I was terribly excited to play through this, being unhampered by hype, expectations, or spoilers.

...I was pretty disappointed by the time I finished. And I've been wanting to discuss it with true Zelda fans ever since. I abandoned the dedicated message boards I used to visit, but I've just now discovered Reddit and I figure I can finally have the long overdue conversation about Skyward Sword I've been wanting to have this whole time.


TL;DR: I played Skyward Sword a year later than everybody else and I finally want to talk about it.

So, what are your thoughts? Did you like it? Dislike it? Was it a return to form or a sad departure? Post anything you feel like. I'll expand on my thoughts if this gets some replies, but my most major complaint was this: 

THERE IS NO WORLD. It felt to me to be the most hollow rendition of Hyrule yet. The only civilization in the game was in Skyloft, with some scant species on the surface. This *concept* to me is acceptable, as it is justified by the story, but the execution, in my opinion, wasn't too great. Skyloft, for the whole game, barely ever felt like any more than the typical beginning tutorial town in a Zelda game. Seeing as it would be the main hub for NPC interaction, they should've made it a much more interesting place to be as the game evolved. The surface dwellers were weak and unremarkable in my opinion, and I was bothered that we didn't get to see any of their communities, like in past 3D installments. A grand total of TWO Gorons roam the surface world, and the other species were all so unremarkable that I didn't feel any grand desire to fight for them. In fact, I like mentally settling with the idea that the Kikwis and Mogmas went extinct when the other tribes moved in. The lack of things to do on the surface made Hyrule effectively feel like one giant dungeon, which took the fun out of exploring anything (not that you really could, as it was too linear as to allow for real exploration). This could perhaps be compensated for if the Sky was interesting to explore, but it wasn't. 90% is accessible within the first hours of the game, and it's largely uninhabited and uninteresting. Not to mention that you're in such close proximity to Skyloft at all times that you never get that psychological feeling that you're exploring new horizons. These factors combined made me disappointed in Skyward Sword, but what do you guys think? I'd love to know and discuss.

Let's have a discussion. This is my opinion on why a game based on the flood would be incredible. Granted, I'm about 103% sure that this will NEVER happen, but it's something that's fun to think about.

3) It Gives us a Hyrule to Revisit

The incarnation of OOT's Hyrule, has been, and most likely will be, the fans' favorite version of Hyrule. For the most part, when fans think of ""Hyrule,"" they think of a Hyrule Field, a Death Mountain, a castle, a forest, Lake Hylia, Zora's River, Gerudo Desert, etc. The child timeline version of this was recreated in Twilight Princess, mostly to favorable reactions. We were able to see the advancements in the land that we grew to love in OOT. In this game, we would be able to see this Hyrule Kingdom in the adult timeline. This would provide several cool opportunities. Perhaps Kakariko would be the most populated city; the opposite of Twilight Princess. The New Deku Tree would be alive in this timeline, providing an opportunity for a sweet revisiting of the Kokiri Forest. It was implied in TP that the Kokiri died off (most likely due to the lack of a new tree), but a world in post-OOT would provide a lot of interesting parallels and contrasts to the aged version of Hyrule we saw in Twilight Princess. Surely, a kingdom recovering from the reign of Ganondorf's destruction would be entirely different from a version that hardly knew who he was. 

2) One More Shot at Ganondorf

Ganondorf (and by extension, ganon), for better or for worse, is *THE* villain of the Legend of Zelda. In most of his incarnations, he has been an incredibly well written and dangerous villain. Unfortunately, the opportunities to use him are being exhausted. Ganondorf, at this point, has been defeated in Ocarina of Time, and then twice more in the respective timelines that branched out of it. To revisit him as a villain, the only solution is to create more convoluted resurrections, which, seeing as how this has already happened twice, has the danger of becoming stale. But this is a chance to have the greatest villain of any Zelda game in history. A game about the Flood would see us up against Ganon(dorf) again, and, seeing as we know how things turn out, it's clear that he's a force to be reckoned with. In Twilight Princess, I feel like Ganondorf had wasted potential, since he hardly even appeared until the very end, and when he did, his destruction was not very prevalent or even well known. In contrast, OOT offered the most satisfying finale of any Zelda game, because *this man destroyed Hyrule*. The stakes were higher and thus the payoff and satisfaction of his defeat was immense. This is a game in which Ganon would, in essence, win (more on that later). It's a game where he DOES wreak havoc on Hyrule, and a game where his power is so strong that the Gods themselves have to intervene. This is the last opportunity to use Ganondorf in a way that would not be stale or convoluted. It's an opportunity for us to see him at his worst. If Nintendo ever revisits Ganondorf, I can't think of a better way to do it, because players have already made the connection between him and this ancient Hyrule.

1) The Stakes Are High

There's something to be said about what you're fighting for in a video game. Some may argue against it, but it's a simple fact: The higher the stakes are, the more you are invested in the cause. The more the game makes *clear* what you're fighting for, the higher the payoff will be. This is why I didn't feel particularly satisfied when I beat Twilight Princess. While a fantastic game, I felt as if the game never put much on the line. The villain never did anything particularly noteworthy. It's as if he was GOING to do bad things to Hyrule if you lost, but we never saw it happen. We dispelled the Twilight, but never even felt the payoff in the real world because the citizens of Hyrule *didn't even know it was there*. Ganondorf made his appearance, and yet, all he managed to do was create a big diamond prism around Hyrule Castle. Most of Castle Town, furthermore, seemed stupidly oblivious to what was happening. So, what were we fighting for? We killed Ganondorf, and yet, I couldn't help but feel Hyrule didn't even notice. When a game validates the player's achievements, or establishes beforehand the stakes that are at hand, the emotional investment we have is much greater. Now, here's why this would work in a game about the flood. 

This is a game where Hyrule, effectively, is destroyed. You are fighting for a land that will ultimately be doomed. Many argue against this idea because *Ganon wins*. We know that. How can you make a game where no hero appeared, and where the bad guy wins? The simple answer is to take the storyline that already exists, and to expound upon it in a way that switches the victory to the player. An example of this is Halo: Reach. (Spoilers follow) We played a game defending a planet that we knew was doomed. We knew that Master Chief was the Last Spartan, and that consequently your Spartan and his team would all die. And yet, the game was able to keep the stakes high and invest the players in completing a mission that would allow us to *win*. The last mission focused on securing the AI Cortana, and safely delivering her to the Pillar of Autumn as the Covenant destroyed the planet. You are ultimately successful, and in the end, it was through Cortana that mankind achieved victory in the subsequent Halo titles. On a smaller scale, the good guys lost, but in the end, the actions of the main hero lead to a victory that could not have happened had you failed.

Bringing this back to Zelda, this could be the case with the flood. There's ways to explain why Ganon ""won,"" and why a hero ""never appeared."" All that would have to be done to make Link the victor is to raise the hypothetical amount of destruction that the villain was capable of, and make the known outcome a lessened version of that. Say, then, that Ganondorf reached such power that he was capable of enslaving or destroying all of Hyrule. Say that, BECAUSE of Link's intervention, Hyrule was flooded and the citizens made it to the mountains to create the kingdom we knew in Wind Waker. Or say that Hyrule was already being flooded. Perhaps Link was the reason that people were able to escape and migrate. Any number of plot devices could place Link as the victor, because, certainly, Hyrule's flood is what ultimately foiled his plans. This would also explain the idea that a hero ""never appeared,"" because certainly, Hyrule would likely not notice Link's deeds unless he literally defeated Ganon, especially a Hyrule that widely recognized Link the Hero of Time as the hero who destroyed Ganondorf. Good writing and meaningful story progression could make this game a cause more worth fighting for than in any other game, and a victory well won.

I could add more to this list, but I'm short on time so I'll just submit this right now. But I'm interested to hear everybody's thoughts on this. Do you agree? Disagree? Again, I know that this is something that, in all likelihood, Nintendo would never do, but it's fun to discuss nonetheless.

For me, growing up with LttP and LA, there were many elements in these games that I enjoyed. For instance, collecting the seashells - There was a reward for your hard work and perseverance, usually involving digging every piece of ground, or bashing every tree. 

Then there are the hidden areas. Yes a crack on the wall indicated where to put a bomb, but again, the most rewarding was finding the unmarked caves.

This was continued somewhat in OoT, with the aid of the rumble pack, and the quest for the skulltulas, or finding every bottle (cause you can never have enough faeries am I right?) but digging every patch of grass, or bombing every wall on a game like OoT would be nigh on impossible, let alone, TP or SS, and I think it's lost something with the advent of a more open world mechanic. 

It goes even deeper when you realise that some of your true ""a ha!"" moments, were remembering where you saw a hole you could jump with the roc's feather, or a bomb-able wall in a previous dungeon (before you got the bomb bag).

I feel it's these little things that made the earlier games great. TP never seemed to re-use new items in older dungeons, as a way of rewarding players with memory, and as i recall, there didn't seem to be much in OoT, although I may be wrong. Maybe it's just a mechanic of a bygone era, used to extend the game life of a limited cartridge. But maybe it's also a mechanic of getting the player to connect with the landscape, the towns and characters.    

Take for instance Skyrim. It's an open world to an extent, and I've spent hours trying to climb unclimbable peaks, reaching unreachable waterfalls. And my reward for doing that? Nothing. There was no special weapon or upgrade, no reward for the hard work I put in.

And so it's things like noticing that those longer patches of grass form an X, swimming underwater all the time, remembering there was a rock I can now lift, and being rewarded for it, that makes the games so fun. I used my brain. I wasn't spoon fed clues. I was informed of the game mechanics and left to find the treasure on my own.

But that's just my opinon, what's yours?",,False,,t5_2tfzp,False,,,True,t3_1arhjm,http://www.reddit.com/r/truezelda/comments/1arhjm/what_makes_you_enjoy_the_zelda_series_so_much/,

**As for controls, I definitely expect the Wii U GamePad to be a huge addition.** 

* If any of you have played NintendoLand's Zelda mini-game, you'll know that moving the GamePad itself would aim the bow and arrow.

The first thing I want to talk about is the most recent game on the franchise and why it feels like it lacks a soul.

We have here a good game, a really good game. Has good aesthetistics, good gameplay, overall technical aspects of the game are good. The sword mechanic (central focus of the game) is great. But there's something missing, something unquatifiable, a certain ""magic"" present in other Zeldas and many Nintendo games. In short, every aspect of the game feels like the developers were filling a template. ""Let's put enemies in this part, a heart piece there and boss must be beaten with the tool you have just found, cus it's the way bosses in Zelda are.""

This means that there were no further purpose than ""making a Zelda game"" so they made a game with all the  characteristics of Zelda games, but without passion, without wanting to take the player into a world of theirs, without actually caring about the game.

Examples of this:

* Short, repetitive and unchallenging dungeons
* Useless artifacts (just a few are somewhat useful)
* Unimaginative bosses with boring desings (specially the one you fight at the ship, I felt like playing a children's iOS game)
* None of the characters inspire anything (The mini love story also feels like they were doing it by requeriment and Zelda just lacked personality)
* The game gives no motivation to keep going (""Save Zelda"" From what? She's fine. ""Fulfill your destiny"")
* Your actions make no sense. Everything you were asked to do it's just because the goddess wanted and designed a quest with an unnecessarily ammount of tasks.

This feeling was prevalent since I defeated Girahim the first time. After that, the game falls and became more obvius when the Steam Summer Sale hit and I downloaded Portal 2, a game made with so much love.

1347146448.0,27,self.truezelda,zksgu,The Origin of Bongo Bongo: From a post I made on Smashboards a while back,30,3,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/truezelda/comments/zksgu/the_origin_of_bongo_bongo_from_a_post_i_made_on/,"&gt;So, I was playing Ocarina of Time (my favorite Zelda) the other day, and was pondering the origins of all of the bosses. I know that Gohma was a parasite created by Ganon, King Dodongo was, well, the king of the Dodongos, Barinade was another parasite created by Ganon, Phantom Ganon was a creation of Ganon's, Volvalgia was some kind of dragon that was revived by Ganon (relation to Stallord, maybe? or that one dragon boss from Zelda II?), Morpha was probably just a corruption created by Ganon's evil, and Twinrova was Ganon's mother. The game never really gives us much information on Bongo Bongo, however, except that it was sealed away by the Sheikah.

&gt;First, let's look at the Well. The game states that the man who invented the Lens of Truth had a house where the well is now. It doesn't tell us why his house was destroyed or why the well was built where it was. The bottom of the well appears to be some kind of torture chamber or jail, noted by the cells. Link also has to fight Dead Hand, which guards the Lens of Truth... this might be the man, but not likely (read on). It was more than likely one of his victims. Given the undead theme, torture devices, hidden walls, Dead Hand, and jail cells, this was most likely a horror chamber created by the man who made the Lens of Truth, and he was a murderer. He was probably executed by the Sheikah and sealed away in his own prison...

&gt;When Link becomes an adult, he visits Kakariko Village and meets Sheik there. Bongo Bongo escapes from the well, where he was sealed by the Sheikah. Impa goes to the Shadow Temple to try to hold him off, or something. This dungeon has the same theme, as well as the same miniboss, AND it is behind the graveyard. Link then fights Bongo Bongo, who looks like this:

&gt;http://www.zeldawiki.org/images/b/b1/Bongobongoscreen5.jpg

&gt;Now, notice a few points of interest. The hands are seperated from the arms. In the Middle East, the punishment for stealing is cutting off the hand. I speculate that this man may have been a theif too, as he probably stole the Hover Boots. Also, note the eye. This is clearly what's left of his neck. He was most likely executed by decapitation (another common practice in the Middle East) and his own ""Eye of Truth"" developed in its place. The guillotines in the Shadow Temple support this.

[Observe Zant twitch his head, and appear to possibly remove Ganondorf's spirit from his body, or just kill him](http://youtu.be/87u1AarcfQA?t=1m45s)

Zant twitches his neck first, and doesn't seem to die at all. It's clearly just a twitch, and Zant popping his neck. Ganondorf is the only one that died here. What seems to be going on is that while Ganondorf was using Zant, Zant was the one that brought the Twilight realm to Hyrule, and the one that brought Ganondorf back his body. After all, the reason that Ganondorf couldn't just re-enter Hyrule in the first place is because he was locked in the Twilight realm. Looks to me that Zant's expansion of his own dominion allowed Ganondorf to enter Hyrule, and that at the end Zant sort of evacuated Ganon's soul before he died, which would allow for Ganondorf to return again, possibly in Zelda U [(Only Rummors)](http://www.zeldainformer.com/news/rumor-zelda-u-a-sequel-to-twilight-princes#comment-980944475).

Notice also, that Ganondorf's body continues to stand there. Could it be that his body is still dying, and that his spirit was just removed from it, causing his eyes to roll up into his head?

Finally, back when Zant dies, he says that [as long as Ganondorf lives, then he will always resurrect Zant](http://youtu.be/rqUCO0LN_Fk?t=42s). Between that point and when Ganondorf is defeated, Ganondorf has had ample opportunity to resurrect Zant. Perhaps their souls are bound together now, and that is potentially what gives Zant the ability to evacuate Ganondorf's soul.

**Edit:** Basically my observation and theory is this:

* Link Kills Zant
* Ganondorf revives Zant off-screen (Theory)
* Link returns to Hyrule and challenges Ganondorf
* Link kills Ganondorf
* Just before Ganondorf dies, Zant evacuates his spirit (Theory)
* Midna leaves
* Ganondorf prepares to return with Zant soon (Theory)

I'm just excited about the possibility.

**Edit 2:** To clarify, the way I see it is that there are three possibilities:

1. Ganondorf was what kept Zant alive. His death kills Zant.
1. Ganondorf was about to die, but was taking too long. Zant, hidden somewhere nearby, uses some kind of neck twitch magic to finish off Ganondorf.
1. Zant saw that his master was about to die, and used some of the power that Ganondorf granted him to pull Ganondorf's spirit out of his body. He would later be able to give that spirit back its body. Like the Elric brothers from Full Metal Alchemist.

But based off of [the rumor originally published by IGN](http://www.zeldainformer.com/news/rumor-zelda-u-a-sequel-to-twilight-princes#comment-980944475), I took number 3 to be the most likely.

I've had this for awhile and realized I should post it to share with my fellow fans. Ocarina of Time is easily my favourite game for many reasons. Strongest of those is the richness of the story, specifically the subtle themes of the game which are open to interpretation. What I want to discuss today may be obvious to some, and mind-blowing to others. So here it is: the three virtues of the Triforce have a correlation to the three phases of time.

Wisdom is the virtue of the past. The longer you live, the wiser you become because you have more experiences to draw from. Those who do not remember history are doomed to repeat it.

Power is the virtue of the present. It's what you can do right here, right now. We live in the present, with the power to make our choices always intact. The past has already occurred, and the future is yet to be seen, and in the present is where our power resides.

Courage is the virtue of the future. There is no fear like the fear of the unknown. The future is for the most part shrouded and uncertain. Courage is required to press onward, where those uncertainties become certain. To know that terrible trials and fates may await us, but we will face them.

Now, I'm not saying this philosophy is ironclad. The virtues can correlate to the other phases as well, for example it can take courage to move on from something in your past.

The Great Deku Tree summons Link to halt the curse placed on him by Ganondorf. Link succeeds and takes possession of the Kokiri's Emerald, and the Deku Tree sends him to see Princess Zelda before succumbing to the curse. Standard stuff so far.

When Link goes to see Zelda, however, she has no idea why he's there, and has no doubts about Ganondorf's allegiance to the King of Hyrule. With nothing to go on, Link departs, keeping tabs on Ganondorf at all times, but without Zelda and Impa's help, he never puts into action a plan to open the Door of Time and reach the Triforce.

Years pass, and eventually, Ganondorf and his band of thieves somehow find a way into the Sacred Realm. Ganondorf attempts to claim the Triforce, but it splits into its three components, imbuing Ganondorf with Power, Zelda with Wisdom, and Link with Courage.

Emboldened, Link attempts to stop Ganondorf from conquering Hyrule, but without the aid of the Master Sword or the various trials that made him a hero in the Adult Timeline, Link is defeated. Ganondorf claims the last two pieces of the Triforce, transforming into the Demon King Ganon. The ancient sages (not the ones from OoT, possibly those seen in Twilight Princess) seal Ganon away in the Sacred Realm, temporarily defeating him.

However, Ganon and his armies eventually break free, leading to the Imprisoning War as described in the backstory of LttP. Through all the carnage, Zelda desperately thinks of a plan to make things right. By her divine power, she prays for the entire crisis to be averted, to have Ganondorf punished before he can rise to power. Unfortunately, she is unable to change her own timeline, but her prayers are indeed answered.

1353901626.0,27,self.truezelda,13slxl,First post on r/truezelda. I was wondering if anyone shares my theory or has other theories regarding OoT's Forest Temple as a former Deku Palace?,31,4,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/truezelda/comments/13slxl/first_post_on_rtruezelda_i_was_wondering_if/,"My theory was that the Forest Temple was a palace that was overtaken or ruined in the Hylian Civil War or catastrophic event. Since then, Saria has been the only one to uncover its whereabouts (I'm assuming she was called there since she is the sage of Forest) and its been haunted by the ghosts of the rulers who once lived there. Perhaps this was a ""deku palace"" of sorts, and the 4 poe sisters are actually deku ghosts. The Forest Temple being a deku palace makes since for two reasons. First, the path to the Forest Temple is lined with deku scrub guards (who are replaced by moblin guards when Ganondorf seizes power). Second, it seems the races perhaps wanted to use the Lost Woods as a labyrinth connecting their royal halls (in case of times of emergency). Within the Lost Woods, there are entrances which lead to Goron City, the outside of Zora's Domain, and the Sacred Meadow. Since the royal halls of the Goron and Zora races (Ruby and Sapphire/fire and water) are connected here, it seems possible to assume the Deku race's (Emarald/forest) royal hall is also connected here. After the fall of the dekus, perhaps their Emerald was found by Kokiri wanderers. Or, maybe the Kokiri are descendants of Dekus. Once they felt safe to leave their meadow, their palace may have been deserted. Just some speculation.

tl;dr - I have a theory that the OoT Forest Temple was a Deku Palace back in the day that has since been abandoned. 4 poe sisters could be royal deku scrub ghosts. Evidenced by the deku scrubs guarding the path to the Forest Temple and Lost Woods connecting Sacred Meadow, Goron City, and Zora's River.

1350356642.0,26,self.truezelda,11jtzo,[SS spoilers] Demise and the lack of agency,34,8,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/truezelda/comments/11jtzo/ss_spoilers_demise_and_the_lack_of_agency/,"Perhaps this is just me nitpicking, but it seems like the quality of Zelda villains has gone down considerably since MC.  We now get really fantastic, well-developed side characters (Midna, Linebeck, Groose, etc), but we haven't had a really strongly-motivated, somewhat sympathetic villain since Vaati's appearance in MC.  Granted, the Zelda series isn't known for having deep, complicated antagonists, but  it seemed like the games were on a role with Skull Kid/Majora, WW Ganondorf, and MC Vaati.

And now we have Demise, and, honestly, he seems to invalidate everything that was awesome about the previous enemies.  For example, in WW, Ganondorf described his motivation for attacking Hyrule during OOT.  He was jealous of the prosperity and wealth the Hylians received, and wanted not only to take that for himself, but to also destroy it for everyone else.

In the social sciences we have a concept called ""agency.""  Wikipedia defines it as the ability of an individual to act independently and on their own free will.  In WW (or, retroactively, in OOT) it could be said that Ganondorf was utilizing his agency to make a decision to overthrow the king and conquer Hyrule.  Other characters can be said to be enacting on their respective agencies when they make a choice.  In theory, you could argue that each Link chose to be good (although the fact that the Links are reincarnations/variations on the same ""heroic spirit"" means you could argue otherwise - that he never has a choice and by his very nature is forced to be ""good"" every time).

But Demise overrides this.  In SS, we learn that he is the source of all evil in the Zelda universe; moreover, that his own spiritual ""descendants"" (Ganon/Ganondorf, at least, but possibly others) will haunt the land of Hyrule and the reincarnated Link/Zelda for the rest of time.  In fact, we can assume that all subsequent acts of evil performed by just about any villain is due to the curse placed on Link by Demise.  It seems to basically remove any character's ability to choose to be good or evil, and seems to destroy agency entirely (which was rather small to start with, since it truly seems like only the evil characters choose to be evil, whereas everyone else just get dragged along into their schemes).

My questions: Do you think agency exists in a universe so laden with concepts of destiny and fate?  Does Demise cheapen the actions of the other villains, particularly the ones who were written with a believable/relate-able backstory?  Can the Zelda series improve upon its villains?  Since it never really seemed to be the aim of the series, should it even try (aka ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"")?

Link is traveling (in what time line or after what game I am not sure yet) and comes to a mountain pass.  While venturing through the mountain pass he comes upon a cave to rest.  Once inside though he finds a group of 6 strange beings surrounding a sphere.  They look extremely strange and alien to Link although he has seen many of the inhabitants of the world in his time.  They had strange glowing, blue eyes and long gangly bodies that were draped in robes.  As he approaches he unsheathes his sword which draws their attention.  They look at him and chuckle amongst themselves.  One announces “there is no need for that… not here at least.”  They go on to introduce themselves as Hurients.  In a cut scene they explain their story of how they were once a tribe of Zora who lived happily long ago but Ganondorf destroyed their tribe and those that survived Ganondorf’s wrath were forced to move to a new area.  As time went on they adapted to not being near the water that they hold so dear and became deformed and strange.  They finally came to this cave that offered a magical water source and they have remained since.  After their story Link begins to stare at the sphere in the center of the room.  They all let out a large chuckle again and state “that is the Sphaera.”  It again goes to cut scene that shows the inside of the sphere and that within it is a society made up of all the races from Hyrule.  They have used magic that they found in the cave to shrink the races of the world and all the necessities of life, grass, water, trees, plants, etc., into the sphere.  They explain that they were working on the sphere to create a way to preserve life in the event Ganondorf were to return and destroy more civilizations.  As the store goes on, they show a darkness that is spreading through the sphere and explain that they need Link’s help to remove it but not to listen to it as it will lie and try to deceive Link.  Link, being the great adventurer and do-gooder he is, offers his help, albeit skeptically. 

After the dialog they use their magic to shrink link into the sphere where he emerges in a temple with only an exit ahead.  Upon entering the outside world he is allowed to explore the area (that is accessible at the time) and speak with the inhabitants.  Some will mention everyday chatter while others will talk about the “gods”.  Those that speak about the gods will talk about how they revere them and how they give and take but most will be very vague, especially about how old their origins.  As an added nuance of the game, Link can look up into the sky and occasionally see one or more of the Hurient’s eyes looking at the world.  Link will then seek out the darkness.  After some trials he will encounter the darkness.  The darkness introduces itself as Linru who looks very much like the Hurients (the creators of the sphere).  He tells Link that he has been trying to stop the Hurients.  He was once one of them but that they began to play god with the civilization and that the people were blind to their actual cruelty because they revered and feared them so much.  They would play sick games with the citizens and sometimes even require sacrifices occasionally.  He tells Link that he tried to stop them but they were too powerful and he tried to stop their cruelty from within the sphere which they would not destroy for fear of losing their play thing.  Link heeds the warning of the Hurients and doesn’t listen.  He commences a fight but Linru will only defend himself.  He eventually tells Link that he has no time for this and disappears in similar fashion to the Skeika.  Link attempts to return to the Hurients but they say that he must kill the darkness to return.  They then tell him of the 6 temples that hold items that can assist him in his quest.  As the story progresses Link finds more and more evidence that Linru was telling the truth.  

After completing all the temples Link can finally try to fight Linru in the final temple that was the same one that he began his time in Sphaera in.  Again Linru tries to explain more about the atrocities of the Hurients.  The Hurients kidnapped the people of different tribes of the world and forced them into the sphere.  The Hurients removed any memory they had and were led to believe that they have always lived in the sphere. He also explains that the whole time that Link was working through the dungeons he was working on a way to bring the Hurients into the sphere (Linru can be encountered in several of the temples).  Link tries to commence the fight but Linru backs off and using magic that he attained from various places he brings the 7 Hurients to the temple.

This is where things get interesting for a Zelda game.

Link can choose to side with Linru or the Hurients.  If he chooses to side with Linru they will fight the Hurients together but inevitably Linru will be defeated (not killed) trying to defend Link.  If he chooses to side with Hurients Link will fight Linru and upon his defeat (not death) the Hurients will turn on Link explaining that they cannot let others know of their “project”.  Once the Hurients are defeated in either event, Link will see that the darkness is gone and Linru, in his dying breath, explains even more.  He says that the people of the Sphaera should stay.  Coming out would be a shock to them all and would most likely make things worse.  Also all the torment that Hurients caused will be no more.  He goes on to talk about how they will be fine, they never needed the Hurients to sustain life and that they will be better off.  Linru passes and Link looks at the Sphaera one last time before leaving.  The final scene is of Link leaving the cave and sealing it.

Obviously there are many things to add such as dungeon styles, the actions of people and what the towns will look like.  Another thought was to add another race; one that the Hurients created in their twisted games.  Perhaps they combine Zoras and Gorons; something of that nature.  Another thing that needs to be thought out are items.  What are your thoughts on this?  I know there are probably some issues somehow.  What are some things that you might add?

1353608497.0,29,self.truezelda,13modw,"The ""real"" problem with Skyward Sword's controls.",38,9,44,http://www.reddit.com/r/truezelda/comments/13modw/the_real_problem_with_skyward_swords_controls/,"Naysayers' biggest complaint of Skyward Sword is its controls. Many people attribute much of the game's difficulty to faulty controls almost as if it were the only way they could have lost otherwise but I've never had a problem with the controls and I had hard time understanding why many people do but I think I've come up with an interesting theory as to why. It all has to do with Bokoblins. Hear me out on this one...

Bokoblins are the most common enemy in the game and besides bosses and mini-boss enemies (like stalfos) are the only enemies that showcase Skyward Sword's sword-dueling combat. Basically they can block your attacks and you have to get around their defenses but these fights work nothing like previews and reviews described for some reason and many people attribute this to faulty controls. They try their hardest to attack where the bokoblins aren't blocking, to lure them to one side and attack from another, but despite their best efforts it never works and a simple fight against a weak enemy becomes a chore.

But the problem isn't the controls being unresponsive. It's that there's a design flaw in bokoblins. Quite frankly it's impossible to maneuver around their defenses under normal circumstances, they are WAY too fast. Say, you hold your sword to the right and they block their left side to compensate, so you want to swing from the left to hit their right sides but either you accidentally swing from the right and get blocked when you try to set up your attack or you slowly move your arm into position and automatically prepared to block from the other side now. Here's what makes it worse:

This does not happen when you fight Ghirahim! He gives you ample time to position your sword and strike him from the side that he isn't blocking. I've tested it over and over, I can fight Ghirahim no sweat but bokoblins are blocking masters. They are impossible to kill the way you are supposed to kill them.

The reason I had no problems with this is because I figured out how to kill them easily and I never bothered getting upset over fighting them ""correctly."" How do you kill them easily? You waggle the controller so that Link attacks from several directions much faster than you would be capable of. A few strikes will be blocked but one will connect and  leave the bokoblin open for several strikes. This is really annoying of course because it was something that was SPECIFICALLY promised that you wouldn't be doing. Every single preview I read said ""you won't be waggling the controller like in Twilight Princess."" But that is exactly what you have to do. I can definitely see why this is a problem and why people would be angry over this but frankly I don't care. I figured out what to do, played through the game and enjoyed it, and got irritated that some previews lied to me about what to expect. Still I feel people expected way too much from this game...

If you're curious then how to fight Technoblins, who will damage you when they block; thus making the waggling impossible, I simply counter-blocked with my shield and attacked them from there. They aren't nearly common enough foes to make this slower strategy too irritating to use.

I actually did find a way to fight bokoblins that was much more similar to the ""correct"" way that we were promised we would be able to. Hold your arm to the right as described before so that the bokoblin blocks his left side, but instead of positioning your arm to strike from the left side; swing to the right from your arm's current position. Link's sword will teleport to the left of the bokoblin to do a proper left-to-right swing faster than the bokoblin can block. Is this the way Nintendo wanted us to fight them? I hope not. I don't prefer this method because it's slower than waggling and isn't as safe as counter-blocking also I'm pretty sure it'll screw up your wii-mote's calibration.

TLDR: The controls aren't bad or unresponsive, staying calm and patient will get you through every battle except for bokoblins who are programmed wrong or were never supposed to be fought like the previews lead us to believe.

The game was released to the American public when I was only a young boy and I always found it too difficult to complete, unlike its predecessor whose 1st and 2nd quests fell like matchstick bridges.  I really liked the game, but I just couldn’t get over the hump and I never finished it in my youth.  As I got older, more Zelda games came.  A Link to the Past was great, Ocarina of Time is one of the greatest games of all time, etc., etc.  I, like many of my friends, am a Zelda guy.  But I always lamented the fact that I just couldn’t defeat Zelda 2.  It was just so different from all the other Zelda games and just too hard when I was a kid.

Many years later, thanks to the vast amounts of free time one has as an undergraduate and the magic of ROM emulators on PC, I was able to revisit Zelda 2 and final complete it.  Childishly, I felt a tremendous sense of accomplishment.  Open chapter from my childhood thankfully slammed shut.  These days, many years after those undergraduate years, I’ve had the chance to revisit all the Zelda games of my youth through the Wii.  As a father, I’ve had the chance to open my son’s eyes to the wonder that is the world of Hyrule, Hylia, etc.  

But it is here and now, upon this third visitation to Zelda 2, that I’ve stumbled upon and crafted a theory that really sets this game apart from the rest from the rest of the series.  Beyond just being an adventure/rpg hybrid, Zelda 2 is actually a brilliantly crafted metaphor for the spiritual journey of a Roman-Catholic, replete with all 7 sacraments.  In the same vein as Pilgrim’s Progress, the game’s narrative and actions follow the symbolic journey of a hero through all of life’s travails.  It is ultimately the iconography and symbolism embedded in the game that reveals it to be an intentional parallel to the reception of the Catholic sacraments.

This is not as far-fetched as it seems.   Christianity was the intended religion for The Legend of Zelda series and some items, especially from the first 3 games of the series, have strong Christian parallels (this is true more so in the Japanese versions of the games; Nintendo of America altered names and images for fear of offending its American audience).  The genius of Zelda 2 then becomes, in spite of the effort to de-Christianize the game, that the game itself stands as one of the most creative and imaginative expressions of the Sacraments and of a Catholic’s spiritual journey through the experience of the Sacraments.  To alter that truth would have been an impossible task without redesigning the entire game.  The entire journey itself is the parallel, not just minor moments or items.  Let me explain.

Link begins his journey in the North Palace, facing to the right and with a sleeping Zelda in the background.  A quick journey to Rauru for the Shield spell and then he is off to the 1st palace.  There’s really no need for any, to use gaming-speak, “grinding” early on in the game.  Also, both Rauru and Parapa Palace are incredibly close to the North Palace starting point so it doesn’t take too long to start on the game’s journey.  What sacrament would this be then?  Well, for Catholics, Baptism comes first.  And Baptism comes early.  Traditionally, it is early on in a person’s life when he/she is baptized into the faith.  Also, it is incredibly difficult, if not near impossible to advance anywhere in the game without obtaining Parapa Palace’s item, the candle.  Back to the sacrament, each baptized Catholic receives his/her own baptismal candle and it is to be kept as a reminder of spiritual birth.  It is also customary to use the baptismal candle for major events later in life and, indeed, Link uses the candle throughout the rest of the game.  Without its light, he is lost.

Leaving Parapa Palace, Link must continue on his journey.  He goes to Ruto and possibly even Saria and earns the Jump spell (with an obvious connection to growing stronger and growing older) and the Life spell (as we get older, we care for ourselves and rely less solely on the goodwill of others), respectively.  Next, he readies himself for Midoro Palace.  This palace, situated in a swamp, requires Link to travel slowly towards it.  There are a few landings of respite on the way, but he must traverse the swamp step by laborious step.  The second sacrament, Reconciliation, also requires this type of step by step preparation.  It is taught step by step, not rushed into.  As to the item in the palace, Link finds the glove that allows him to destroy bricks that would previously have prevented his progress.  The image normally associated with the sacrament of Reconciliation is a child with head bowed and hands folded in prayer.  The item is a glove, the image is a hand.  Also, with this sacrament, the pathway to a cleansed soul is opened just as Link’s pathway becomes cleared.

Growing in experience, Link makes his way through Death Mountain, obtains the Hammer and thus opens his way to the sea.  But before traversing to the eastern continent, he must go the town of Mido where he learns the Fairy spell and the Downthrust sword technique, an interesting juxtaposition of the importance of learning when to be small and childlike (as this is helpful at all stages of life) and the amazing capabilities people gain as they grow in strength. Finally, he goes to the Island Palace.  His adventure here will parallel the most frequently practiced sacrament, the receiving of the Eucharist.  Again, it is in the cleverness of the game’s design that reveals this connection.  This is the first palace where Link can really “max out” his stats with the emergence of the Red Iron Knuckle at the palace entrance (strike the statue, defeat the knight, and gain 100 experience points) and with the palace’s first room containing 3 enemies with a combined 175 experience points to be earned with their defeat.  He repeats this process over and over and over again, just as every week, a Catholic receives the Body of Christ.  Link finds the raft in the Island Palace and he will use it cross the sea.  Even though he is now strong, there is still a great deal more in his journey.

Before he reaches the Maze Palace, Link first goes to Nabooru and Darunia, gaining the magic spells learned there:  Fire, an extension of Link’s growing power, and Reflect, which serves as a connection to his growing intellect.  Geographically, Link must travel farther than he has ever had to get to a palace.  In fact, the Maze Palace is the easternmost and remotest palace in the game.  Link’s will to get there is truly a Confirmation (sorry, couldn’t resist the pun) of his faith.  The enemy of this palace is not one that Link can defeat with the strength of his sword.  Instead, he must use his words.  Thus, this palace boss is not so much a physical challenge as he is a spiritual/intellectual one.  Just as a Catholic confirms his faith to his diocese’s bishop by choosing a new name, so does Link reflect (again!) and stave off the evil of sin by having it bounce off his shield back to its source.  Link finds the winged boots in the Maze Palace, an item he must use to get to the next obstacle in his journey.

After his victory in the Maze Palace, Link returns to Nabooru and walks east to the sea.  Now, he is able to “walk down the aisle” of ocean to The Palace on the Sea.  As another credit to the game designers, there is no other way to get to this palace without walking down the aisle.  Obviously, this is a direct reference to the sacrament of Matrimony.  But the connection does not end there.  The boss of this palace literally wields a ball and chain, which is of course a reference to the somewhat derogatory name for a spouse, “the old ball and chain”.  Link of course defeats this boss just a true marriage of hearts and minds defeats the notion of one’s spouse as “an old ball and chain”.  Also, Link must find the whistle in the Palace on the Sea, which serves as the instrument to the final stage of his journey.

Literally, Link cannot advance without first getting rid of the River Devil who blocks his path.  He does this by playing the whistle.  Really, it’s a heavenly calling that rids the way of the obstacle.  Whistle, music, calling…this action screams of Holy Orders.  The final crystal palace is the Hidden Palace (or Three Eye Palace), but before Link can get to it he must find the Magic Key as there is not a sufficient amount of ordinary keys to successfully complete the Hidden Palace.  Something that goes beyond the ordinary.  The calling.  Again, Holy Orders.  Link finds the town of New Kasuto and finds the Magic Key.  Next, he must use his whistle-calling at Three Eye Rock or Triangle Rock (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit) to reveal the mysterious palace and then use his Magic Key to explore its depths.  What item does he discover?  A cross, which allows him to see the hidden and know the Truth.  I assume there is no need for great explanation here, but there is nothing more Christian than Christ’s Cross.  It is the ubiquitous symbol of the faith.  Also, as Link leaves the Hidden Palace after he’s defeated its boss, what remains on the surface as a reminder of his triumph?  That same symbol of Christ.  The Triangle Rock has become the Cross.  He then goes to Old Kasuto and learns the final spell he’ll need, Thunder.

Lastly, Link must travel to the Great Palace.  What’s the final sacrament?  The Anointing of the Sick or Last Rites.  The end is imminent.  Link must traverse what appears to a river of fire to this final palace.  It is only after successfully defeated all other palaces that he can enter the Great Palace.  He has experienced the first 6 sacraments, but it is only here at the end of his journey that he can experience the 7th.  The largest and most complex of all palaces, the Great Palace is a twisting maze of confusion and sometimes despair.  Through great effort, Link finds the final boss, Thunderbird, and uses the Thunder spell, thus forcing this demon to reveal his true colors.  It is only trusting in the power from above that Link is able to defeat this challenging boss.  But, in the last great twist of the game’s design, Thunderbird is not the final boss.  Link himself is, or at least the darkness that is a part of Link’s, and every man’s, soul.

After defeating Thunderbird, Link returns full circle to the North Palace (“Remember, you are dust, and to dust you shall return”) and must fight “Dark Link” in order to be truly victorious.  This conflict is fitting and apropos of the game’s overarching metaphor.  What is essence of Catholic faith if not the ability of the soul to know and to fight off and reject the sinful self?  Ultimately, all the sacraments are the vessels we use to fight against our own sinful natures.  After Last Rites, what remains?  The judgment.  Has a man done enough good to overcome his own dark, sinful nature?  Can he enter into Paradise?  In the ultimate expression of the power of Christ’s redemption, Link overcomes his dark self.  He’s earned his Triforce.

I believe these things look different as they are altered each time the legend is passed down. For example, the Hyrule seen in Ocarina of Time and Twilight Princess, is very similar in both games, but are not exact. I like to think that this is due to how people tell the Legend, and how it is passed through the centuries.
I also use the same theory to explain graphical changes that may have been made.
So this was just *my* little theory explaining why some things look different in each game. Just thought I'd share. What do you guys think about this?

I also like the theory that the Lanayru sand sea became the Haunted Wasteland of ocarina of time, but that's another discussion. :P

So just for fun, here's some whacked out theories:

THE KING OF HYRULE

This ones kinda out there.
What if during all the events in OOT, the king of hyrule was actually adult Link?
Or the link from the previous age, who during the Hyrulian Civil War united the kingdom and then fell prey to Gannon after the new younger link was born?
I've always thought it was fishy how link's mom just dumped him with kokori. Could she have been the queen? ARE LINK AND ZELDA SIBLINGS? They sure look a like. They're the only Hylians with blonde hair and blue eyes.

FIERCE DIETY

In MM, when Link wears a mask he takes on the shape of the soul that resides within. But it's more than just that, some of HIS features are also present. (Such as his tunic when he's a deku.)
 So with this logic in mind, we can safely assume that a portion of Fierce Diety's features are actually Link's. The shape of his tunic, maybe even some of his Hylian features like his ears.

So here's where my theory kicks in. where/what is the deity-side of Fierce Deity's features? And here's some of the ones I was thinking:

Is Fierce Diety the ""king"" of the Ikana Valley? He has a Triforce of power on his breastplate, and the stone temple is the only place in MM with reference to the Triforce. Could he be the demon with the tongue depicted on the walls of the temple?

If Termina is a causation from the time traveling of OOT, only reachable through the nexus that is the lostwoods, is FD actually the Demise of Termina?

Or could he be a remnant of the ""first race?"" His helix sword is a pretty interesting and futuristic design, and the more ancient times we delve into in Zelda seems to tell that there was highly advanced civilization with robots and the like.

THE SKULL KID
This is pretty probable.

The skull kid from OOT is the same as the one in MM.
The Lost Woods is undoubtedly a nexus. A ""hub"" that all dimensions connect to. If you go wandering in you, you might never walk back into the same hyrule. I'm convinced he is the same given he never leaves the woods.",,False,,t5_2tfzp,False,,,True,t3_19t00z,http://www.reddit.com/r/truezelda/comments/19t00z/vodka_induced_zelda_mindfs/,

The end of Skyward Sword really leaves the player's imagination to wander. Zelda says she will leave on the earth below, and asks Link what he will do next. He looks at the sky.

I believe it is hands down Skyward Sword Link that is the ""Best"". 

Let's take a look at what he did exactly.

 Edit- I'm leaving my original post below what I'm about to post, for consistency sake. I've reworded everything to be more coherent, while making some points more clear.  

* Even though he was the chosen hero by the goddess, he reaped very little benefit from it. All he got was a blessed sword-nothing else. There was no previous Link for him to inherit skills from, he obtained those skills himself. Almost all the other Links after him didn't have to train to get their skills, they just kind of... got them. (TP Link trained, WW Link trained a little bit.)

* Probably the most obvious, but Skyward Sword Link basically created the most powerful, influential, legendary sword in existence for himself and any who comes after him to use.

* He defeated Demise in his most powerful form. In a form so powerful not even the Goddess was able to defeat him. Every Link after him fought a very weakened version of Demise. Sure, Ganondorf has the Triforce of Power, but that's nothing compared to the power of Demise in his original form. Before you try and argue that Demise and Ganondorf are of the same power, let me ask you this: Why does Ganondorf REQUIRE the Triforce to take Hyrule? Demise didn't need it, he just wanted it.

* He saved three of the most important minor deities- Water Dragon, Thunder Dragon, and Levias. Without them, a lot of things would be different.

* He is the ONLY Link to be chosen by all three pieces of the Triforce. Some of the other Links obtained the Triforce, and it listened to him because he's the hero, but SS Link was actually deemed worthy by the entire Triforce.

* He single handedly ran through a land uninhabited by human life, makes contact with several different species, establishing friendly relations with those species for the rest of humanity. He killed thousands of monsters to make the land friendly for the inhabitants, and eventually for the humans.

* Despite being the ""Chosen hero"" he had to prove himself worthy of the Master Sword, and the Triforce an ungodly amount of times.

Objectively-To look at something while not influenced by personal feelings or opinions, considering only the facts.

Everything below the line is my original post, it's not really worth looking at.
______________________________________________________________________________________________


 
 *  First off, other than Fi, he received no real help from the Goddess.  He was not born a hero, he became a hero.  He was not given skills from the get go, he obtained those skills.  He didn't have the Triforce and it's powers, he had himself, a blessed sword, and an annoying robot.


* I feel this one is the most obvious, but he more or less created **the most powerful, influential, legendary sword in existence for himself and any who comes after him to use.**  


* He defeated Demise in his most powerful form, his most evil destructive form, so powerful not even the goddess herself was able to fully defeat.  Every Link after fought Demises' reincarnation, at not nearly the same level of power.  I'm not denying that Ganon is powerful, but comparatively, he's like an angry kitten.  He also sealed Demise a total of 4 times when he was the imprisoned.

* He saved three of the four minor deities in the land.  We can't know what would happen if one of them had died, but it cannot possibly be good.

* He got the TRIFORCE.  He did not just get a piece of the triforce, he got all three pieces.  ~~No other Link can say the same (I think).~~ Most other Links can't say the same.

I call bs. First, we establish that it’s not Skull kid’s dream since this Link appears in TP as a stalfos/ghost. Everyone on board? Good.

To start, people assume that the moment someone walks into the Lost Woods, they start the transformation. In OOT, Grog is sitting in the LW the moment you get the pocket cucco. You can go the whole game without talking to him, and he’ll be sitting there, which is most likely longer than 3 days (or however long Link was travelling). If he, idle as he was, was able to withstand transformation for so long, so can Link. Next, we have the alternate world that is “created by Link’s mind”. Termina is an alternate world, yes, but one that is traversable through some means. Skull kid (that is hinted to be the same one as in OOT) brings Link into this alternate world, and Link is seen leaving into the woods at the end. Not only that, but the Happy Mask Salesman is also referenced to be the same one as in OOT, meaning he also has access to this mean of transportation. If you’re still saying “they could have been made by Link’s mind”, take a look at [Phantom Gannon’s Sword]( http://zelda.wikia.com/wiki/Phantom_Ganon%27s_Sword) from WW. Insignificant? No. On the sword is inscribed “Zubora Gabora” (in hylian). What’s that? [These guys]( http://zelda.wikia.com/wiki/Zubora_and_Gabora). Not only does this prove that Termina exists during the events of OOT (if the timeline splits, to produce this sword), but it also validates that this place is, in fact real, and can be accessed through some mean of transportation.

I've always found its story to be one of the most ""realistic"" ones of the Zelda series to date (barring Skyward Sword, which I cannot rate right now due to not having played through it more than once). The fact that you initially have to go to save your sister makes Link's development from a young innocent child to courageous hero more personal and believable. The player goes through the dungeons honing their skills, and when the time comes to finally save your sister, the player feels as though they've become strong enough to do just that. After you've saved her, the transition from saving his sister to saving Hyrule seems more natural; you've been fighting Ganondorf all along, so it seems fitting to end his evil reign yourself to prevent what happened to your sister to happen to others. 

The way that it's been done in other games (ie. simply thrusting the duty onto Link and him just being the hero from the getgo) takes me out of the game and makes me feel like the Link that we've exposed to in those types of Zelda games too one-dimensional. We're playing the games because we want to, not because we have to; in a similar vein, I feel like Link should take up the duty to save Hyrule because he wants to as well. I feel like Ocarina of Time was unfortunately a victim of this. Link's reason to fight as given by the Deku Tree felt like a parent telling his child to do something ""because I said so"" to me. He was taught how to use a sword not by an instructor, like in Wind Waker, but by signs. His courage is apparently genetic because he is a Hylian, not earned because of his efforts. As much as I loved playing Ocarina of Time, the story didn't grip me as much as the majority of others who have played it because I didn't feel like Link had a reason to want to fight.

While searching for Navi in the Lost Woods (before MM even happens), Link 'dies' and is turned into a stalfos.

1361072198.0,21,self.truezelda,18oa5t,A theory of a One-World Zelda that explains the purpose behind the creation of the world and the origin of evil forces,26,5,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/truezelda/comments/18oa5t/a_theory_of_a_oneworld_zelda_that_explains_the/,"I have a theory I would like to propose to r/TrueZelda that tries to explain why the three goddesses, Din, Nayru, and Farore, created the world in the beginning, how evil forces continue to appear throughout the serieis and how the different lands featured in the Zelda series are actually related to one another. Please enjoy.

---
**The Creation of the World**

In the beginning, there were lots of cosmic beings running around the universe. Some were good deities (greater and lesser), and some were evil deities (greater and lesser). The three greater goddesses, Din, Nayru, and Farore (aka ""The Golden Goddesses), came up with a plan to deal with the demonic forces causing chaos in the cosmos. In an attempt to bind the evil forces and seal them away forever, these three deities created a new place to serve as their prison.

Din, the goddess of power, formed the land of this new world to serve as the physical structure that enclosed the evil. Inside this prison, all the greater and lesser demons of the universe were cast, including beings such as Demise, Malladus, and possibly Majora. Nayru, the goddess of wisdom, created the law and order of the world (i.e. gravity, weather systems, oceans, etc.) that would maintain the structure's hold on the evil. Last, Farore, the goddess of courage, created the plants, wildlife and inhabitants of this world to both maintain the world and follow the order of it.

When it came time for the Golden Goddesses to leave this new world, they left behind the Triforce as a last resort mechanism for the inhabitants to use the power of the goddesses as needed should the evil forces within the earth ever start to break out. Along with the Triforce, the greater goddesses left behind a lesser goddess, Hylia, as an overseer of this world, protecting both the Triforce and the people in their new environment.

---
**The Origin of Evil**

Now we see numerous references in the series that the evil forces are bound within the earth or otherwise originate from the earth:

Demise is referred to as ""The Imprisoned"" and at the start of *Skyward Sword* is bound underneath the original site of the Goddess Statue sealed below the earth with a physical spike. The story states that in the beginning, under the leadership of their ""Demon King"" Demise, evil demons came forth to ravage the land. This could suggest a few possible conclusions: (1) that there are only a few greater demons while there are countless lesser demons and/or (2) that in the time after first being imprisoned, Demise took control over the other demons within the ""Evil Realm"" by default or by dominating them through force and strength. Since Demise is the first recorded Demon King in the history of Zelda to appear and is also described as ""the source of all monsters"", one could also conclude that (1) he was the strongest of all the demons in order to breach the surface first and (2) that because of his first escape, he lead other lesser demons to populate the world above and remain scattered.

Likewise, in other parts of the world, another great ""Demon King"" named Malladus has caused trouble and begun to break free of his bonds. Whether or not he is also a true ""Demon King"" could depend on a number of factors, such as (1) if time had passed after Demise was sealed into the Master Sword and Malladus is the next most-powerful demon to assume the title or (2) if the evil forces within the Evil Realm are spread apart into different sub-groups following different leaders. The backstory to *Spirit Tracks* shows that extra bindings were required to suppress the power of Malladus in the form of the Spirit Tracks.

Could other evil beings have originated from within this prison under the earth known as the Evil Realm, such as Bellum and Majora? Could they also have from within the earth corrupted the minds of surface-dwellers such as Vaati, the ancient tribe that used Majora's Mask and the Dark Interlopers who later became the Twili?

If the world is their prison and the Triforce is the key to the prison, it would explain why the demons are so intent on getting their hands on that precious artifact.

---
**One-World Zelda**

Now my theory also suggests that this world that the Golden Goddesses created is the same world that all the different lands featured in the series are a part of. See the image below for a depiction of my multi-part theory. 

To fully contain the evil within this void in the universe, the prison would need to be three-dimensional. This suggests that the world of Zelda, following my theory on its purpose, is actually a spherical planet. This theory could explain a number of things in the series:

* How many of the same races seen in Hyrule are seen in other lands such as Termina
* How Link travelled to Termina partially through the use of falling down a deep chasm
* How certain objects called Moon's Tears are seen in different lands in the series, suggesting they share the same moon.

In addition to that, in some turn of events the Skull Kid/Majora once again has possession of the Ocarina of Time (and keeps it at the conclusion of the game).

This could open the door for a sequel, in which Majora now seeks the triforce in order to simply bring suffering to the world instead of just Termina. It would bring Link's travels back to Hyrule and perhaps give Majora some abilities to mess with the flow of time Oracle of Ages style. Maybe this would allow for time travel into the past like in the Oracle game (I don't recall if there were any prerequisites to using the ocarina other than just knowing the Song of Time). 

My idea kind of falls apart at that point. Maybe Link could call upon the power of the Master Sword to defeat Majora once and for all. But in order to do that, he would need to get the Ocarina back to open the Door of Time. (Maybe a mid-game battle with Majora?) Of course once he opens the door and pulls the sword that would let Majora into the sacred realm. But then where might Ganondorf be? Majora and Ganondorf could then have their own battle for power in the 7 years Link is sleeping. Possibly ending in one of the antagonists using the other's power to conquer (Ganondorf) or destroy (Majora)....and 3 more timelines...

I'd like to here the dissenting opinion,53,34,69,http://www.reddit.com/r/truezelda/comments/1ix5nm/my_friend_asked_me_why_i_didnt_like_skyward_sword/,"here's my long ass skype message:

The world is SMALL. Despite being hyped as the biggest world yet it’s probably the smallest. There is one town in the whole fucking game. The sky doesn’t take long to explore and what’s with EVERY SINGLE “secret” in a chest somewhere in the sky marked on your map. The land beneath the sky is small too! Three areas, that’s right three… There’s no exploration whatsoever. The game can’t be a grand, epic adventure if the world is small and you’re saving the one AND ONLY town in the game. Because of this there is also a lack of people, maybe 20 and they’re almost all in the same town. The extra stuff for you to do is also lame and located in this small town… Zelda’s suppose to have vast lands to explore and new places to go, people to meet. Skyward Sword has four places to go and you go there in a repetitive order. There’s no exploration at all, fairy fountains, hidden caves, etc. The other games were much more open world then this one.

Fi… MUTHA FUCKIN FI!!! She can go kill herself. Take Navi, take away all personality and usefulness and then also double the amount of times she pauses the game to say something and BOOM! There’s 123.5673% chance you have Fi who can go kill herself. She and the whole game also refuse to let you play the game way too much. Everything and anything is shoved into your ears at least twice and it pauses the gameplay too much.

Controls are bad, people say “it’s never gonna be 1:1 exactly”, well then fucking don’t do it. Doesn’t matter if possible or not, if it’s not 1:1 it’s BAD. Twilight princess did it right, a swing was just another button pressed in an awesome way. Not only the sword movement but somehow the pointing was screwed up too, I never had trouble pointing at shit in Twilight Princess. And you know what makes bad controls even worse? THE GAMES FUCKING BASED OFF THESE CONTROLLS!!!! It makes it boring; almost every enemy, including the bosses are defeated by swinging in a certain direction (even though mad flailing of the arm can kill most of them anyway) and many puzzles are this too…DULL.

I find the story dull and the “epic” quest involving to many tedious tasks like collecting and backtracking through this small world. The world is too static and unchanging. In past games you could change the environment in cool ways such as change time, make it rain etc. This is usually done with a musical instrument, “but wait Skyward Sword has the harp, herpderpderp!” WHOOPDIE FUCKIN DOO! All it does is give a tiny mini game to open a series of places it tells you to open. The puzzles you face throughout the story just seem uncreative, part of this due to it almost all being based off Wii Motion Plus as I said before. RIP Day/Night Cycle. Another cause of this horribly static world is that it’s day all the fucking time. Oh wait you can sleep and make it night! OH WAIT! YOU CAN ONLY DO IT IN SKYLOFT, CAN’T LEAVE SKYLOFT AND THERE’S NOTHING TO DO!!!!!! Time just stands still, it’s just bad. 

Time for just my preferences! I’m just going to list shit I didn’t like. I don’t like the inventory setup. It’s way to difficult to drink a potion in this game and I don’t like not being able to use all my items whenever I want. I also just don’t like how the game doesn’t pause anymore when you go to the item menu. I’m also not a fan of the art, my favorite art is from Twilight Princess and my second favorite is from Wind Waker, this in the middle stuff looks bad in my opinion. While in Wind Waker that style could greatly characterize the characters by appearance alone (so could Twilight Princess with it’s style), Skyward Sword seems to just do it worse because it can’t quite get the full affect from each art style. I didn’t like how they arranged the story; it never had the clean-cut concept of stopping evil. I don’t like the stamina meter, it doesn’t need to be there. WHERE ARE THE FUCKING FAIRES AND MAGIC… for real though, no fountains, magic, nothing. Also where’s the castle? Some one tell me WHERE THE FUCKING CASTLES HIDING!! IT’S A ZELDA GAME GODDAMNIT GIVE ME A CASTLE!!! Nothing seemed super evil and dark to me. It’s like I’m playing a Disney movie. I think there’s a lack of interesting items and uses for said items, I also just don’t like the upgrade system or the durability shield. 

I’m sure I could think of some other things but you’re not worth it *censored friend's name*. 

Damn, this was suppose to be a skype message but when I talk about Zelda shit just adds up. You have better of read it all or I’ll kill you.

1372958028.0,20,self.truezelda,1hn5w4,Finished Skyward Sword a few days ago. Here's an afterthought with a discussion on time paradox (Spoilers),22,2,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/truezelda/comments/1hn5w4/finished_skyward_sword_a_few_days_ago_heres_an/,"It's been a while since I've finished any game. And finishing this one was much less of a chore than most recent ones. In fact, the ending left me feeling happy.

Let's take a moment to despell any plot holes. Near the end of the game, you are asked to plant a seed for the Thunder Dragon. This seed takes over a 1000 years to bear fruit, however, so it's obvious that you got to do some time travel. But here's where things get interesting. Talk to Groose before you plant the seed. He admires the spot and recognizes that the tree is not there. After planting the tree in the past, it appears in the present. Groose then comments on how gorgeous it is. See, he did not say that it magically appeared. *The present you knew was altered because you changed the past*. You learned through implication that the tree has always been there. Remember this for the ending.

At the end, the Master Sword must be placed in it's slot in the past. Once you arrive in the present, the Master Sword is still there in all it's glory. This does not mean that you did not have adventures with the Sword, but rather, that it has always been there. Your job was to restore it and put it there after taking care of this and that bad guy.

So are the Goddess Sword and Master Sword different blades altogether? They are the same. It's implied that the blade loses it's power and seal somehow, which releases Demise's residual consciousness to become The Imprisoned. Did you notice how the room to Zelda's solitude was slightly ajar in the present? Something happened. Anyway, The Master Sword becomes the Goddess Sword and must be reforged by Link.

But hasn't the Master Sword always been there if the tree has always been there? It's there in the pedestal in the present! It shouldn't be there! You changed the present by leaving it in the past! This would mean that they are different blades and Nintendo is stupid right? Not necessarily! The time portal is closed at a certain point in the past and must be reopened in the future. There is only one timeline that can replay itself indefinitely. The blade is there in the present because you do not hold it anymore. At this point, the only thing that prevents this from being a time paradox is that the Master Sword.... is magic. It just wouldn't be the Master Sword if it weren't there. That's all. It's omnipresent. And we kinda have to leave it at that because it's a game.

1370457643.0,21,self.truezelda,1fqkb7,[Spoilers] Let's talk Zelda U! (x-post from r/zelda for maximum discussion),27,6,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/truezelda/comments/1fqkb7/spoilers_lets_talk_zelda_u_xpost_from_rzelda_for/,"**There are probably going to be quite a few spoilers ranging from minish cap, twilight princess OoT, and aLttP.**

Well, to simply put it: [Timeline Placement.](http://imgur.com/owTW1zA)

I know it's not usually in their nature to make games that are chronologically right after each other, but there is SO MUCH they could do there, it seems like a good idea. Plus it's my favorite era of history (note: I'm not sure it would be the same link from SS. It might be, but it's never been confirmed, obviously. The fact that they are using the same art style, and how SS ended, could be a hint that it is, though.)

I'll go ahead and list some of the many things that occur in the era.

* Hyrulean Civil War for control over the triforce and sacred realm, resulting in the Hero of Light emerging and building the Picori blade (Imagine if you got to fight in a huge war battle, it would be a great test of the Wii U capabilities and really fun, I think)
* The Great Betrayal (of the Sheikah, most believe) when those who could wield magic and protected the sacred realm tried to steal the triforces power for themselves, using the Fused Shadow, and then were sealed by the 3 Light Spirits (once the great dragons) into the twilight realm by command of the Golden Goddesses.
* Establishment of the sages? The Sage of Light Raaru places the triforce back in the sacred realm, seals it, and builds the Temple of Time on top of it.
* Hyrule Kingdom Establishment, but not unification, so in this game you actually fight the other races.
* It's a time skip to after Minish cap, but that would be cool to see the hyrule unification war and possibly the scene where Link's mother gives him to the Deku Tree, shortly after the Link before this one dies at the end of the game, or something. 

**Other more random ideas:** 

* An end to one of the ""Hero is Successful"" timelines, such as link going back to the past to when the goddesses were leaving, and stopped them, asking them not to leave behind the triforce, but instead watch over the land because of how much war and evil it's attracted. This is just a random idea I had for a Zelda game.
* I haven't finished the Oracle games, so if they do explain why the Goddesses are in human form, never mind, but if not, they should have a game explaining. (Let me know if they do, but don't actually explain it.)

So what do you guys think on these theories? What are your own?

1364969360.0,22,self.truezelda,1bkmon,Idea for a Ganondorf based spinoff game. (Spoilers of a few games) xpost from r/zelda,28,6,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/truezelda/comments/1bkmon/idea_for_a_ganondorf_based_spinoff_game_spoilers/,"I've always loved the character of Ganondorf, and really love learning more about the centuries long battle between him and Link's descendants. So I always thought it would be cool to have an origin story game for him. I think it should go something like this...

The game takes place During Ocarina of Time, with occasional flashbacks to when Ganondorf was a kid to learn more about the character. The bulk of the game would be you controlling Ganondorf as he does all of the things the characters mention. Thus, you'd be playing the Dungeons from the original game, but trying to accomplish something else. (And they'd probably be redesigned for gameplay's sake) For example, you'd curse the Deku Tree, Fill Dodongo's Cavern with monsters and block the entrance, and do whatever to Jabu Jabu to make him wanna eat Ruto.

We'd learn about the plight of the Gerudos and how the Kingdom of Hyrule didn't aid them as much as they needed. You could have a whole racism thing going on there. Couple that with Demise's presence turning Ganondorf more and more evil and we have a character piece.

We could get his side of the story and see him go from Ambassador of the Gerudos to Power Hungry Maniac. Maybe he wants equality for all area of Hyrule, and the only way his now twisted and Demise filled mind can think of is to make all of Hyrule a wasteland. He learns about the Sacred Realm and the Triforce granting wishes, so he sets off to find what he needs to get there.

I'm also thinking at first he doesn't mean to be evil. I'm thinking he never had an aptitude for magic until Demise starts to take over and some of his initial curses are just Ganondorf showing weakness and submitting to the dark magic. HENCE why he craves POWER...just thought of that, I like that. We might even feel for him. Maybe there's a girl somewhere along the line...whatever.

The flashbacks could also cover things like his surrogate moms, being treated like a king since he's the only male, and learning to fight.

Anywho, then it gets to the point where Link goes into the Chamber of sages to sleep for 7 years. Maybe there's a playable section where you work your way in and get the triforce of power and begin what happens during Link's slumber. Once Link is out cold, you go to all of the temples and literally work your magic within them.

Occasionally you'll have some run ins with a mysterious ninja guy. You also create Phantom Ganon, Revive Volvagia, Make...Morpha happen/drain the lake, release Bongo Bongo, and meet up with your surrogate mothers back in your homeland. At this point, you've taken over Hyrule, so you wait.

Some more backstory, about your moms, Demise's influence, and the possible love interest, whatever.

Fast forward to you capturing Zelda and playing the organ for a while. Link comes and you have a climactic battle. I think it would be a bit different from the actual OoT battle because of how I envision the gameplay (More on that thought later). Anyway you have a sword fight or something and Link wins.

You so desperately want to see equality in the world, you think of your moms and your maybe girlfriend and you can't even fathom how some stupid kid with a fairy defeated you in a sword fight, something all Gerudos train to do, it seems. In his moment of pure weakness and anger, he lets himself get completely consumed by the darkness that Demise has been granting him and becomes the beast Ganon. You have the fight against Link as the beast.

Now, in Oot Link wins. A Zelda game where the player character loses is sort of unheard of. If only there was a version of OoT in which Ganon wins...oh wait...THERE IS. This game would end setting the evens for the timeline in which Link is unsuccessful into motion. I'm thinking Ganondorf is so deep in the darkness here, he remains in his Beast form forever. Hence why Ganon is the main villian in all of the games in that timeline and not Ganondorf.
In the other two timelines, he either doesn't get to that point in OoT and does so later in TP when he's executed by the sages. He hits his weak point just before he dies or gets banished and stripped of his beast powers, I guess, and we never see him again until he breaks out of his 'prison' and then gets legit killed and then we actually never see him again.

I think gameplay would be very similar to the main series. The puzzles could be the same type of thing, but I think the combat should be more like God of War or Kingdom Hearts. Very fast paced. I also think he should wield the two Scimitars that the Gerudos use in OoT. We only ever actually see him with two swords of his own in WW. Otherwise he's only had the sword that almost killed him in TP. SO I think that would be how you'd fight. Quickly killing enemies, with two swords. I think that suits his character more too.

Welp, there's that. I'm not sure if I'd want to play as him as a kid/young adult at all or if that should just be flashbacks. Either way, I just thought of this game and was like...OH MAN. So tell me what you think.

It's pretty cool. But, like almost all Zelda material, it introduces new and interesting canon.

**===Whole plot summary follows===**

Before the events of Skyward Sword, Hyrule stood on the ground, and Link, a knight of Hyrule, and a powerful hero, was imprisoned by his own people over a misunderstanding for over four years. The people then released Link, pleading with him to save Hyrule when the Demon King's arrival was imminent. Grinning, he points out how *convenient* it is that he be released when the people need a hero. However, his bitterness is only superficial: ""My dear land of Hylia! Though people's hearts may change with time, this land's beauty, pride, and purity never change. If you have need of me...then I will forever fight to defend you.""

Through the next several pages, he defeats the Demon King, and forges an eternal bond with the red loftwing (who was ridden by the Goddess Hylia), an event which causes the Triforce symbol to appear on the Master Sword, a blessing of the Three Dragons. With the help of Hylia, Castle Hyrule was split from the land, and the Master Sword became a ""pillar between heaven and earth, guided by the loftwing, rising to the heavens."" Link, however, succumbed to his wounds, praying for their happiness with all his heart.

The Goddess Hylia then reveals that Link's imprisonment was necessary to shape him into the hero they all needed, one worthy to wield the Master Sword. ""But because of this, your life has been full of suffering. I have watched you...and felt your pain like a knife through my body. I will ensure that your gentle, heroic spirit will live on eternally. And I...I shall shed my divinity. The next time we meet, I wish to stand before you as a simple human. Whenever the land of Hylia is in danger...we shall be reborn...""

===End summary===

There are obvious conclusions to draw from this:

* Link, the knight of Hyrule, is the *original hero*, and the Link of Skyward Sword is the *first reincarnation*. All the Links in the games are reincarnations of the Hero of Hyrule.

* Link's ascension to hero status was preordained by the gods, who are well aware of his suffering.

* Link's mysterious connection to the powerful red loftwing is a relic of his predecessor's bond with it.

* The red loftwing is a beast from the heavens, by nature superior to all other loftwings. The Goddess Hylia was its original rider.

* The Demon King, Demise, is indeed the origin of evil. In the manga, he did not die, but was instead sealed away. In the events of Skyward Sword, Link killed him for good, though his hatred will take form through an endless cycle of reincarnation.

There are still a few mysteries, however:

* ~~The Master Sword was borne to Hyrule by the Goddess Hylia, but had to be broken by the Hero and reforged before it could be wielded. Why was this necessary? The Master Sword has always been choosy about its wielder, only awakening its full power once Link undergoes some kind of task. While the tasks early in the timeline were prohibitive (Skyward Sword, Ocarina of Time), in no game was it required to *break the sword and reforge it*. Perhaps such a drastic measure was necessary to tie the Master Sword to Hyrule?~~ Edit: The manga states that the Master Sword was created by the gods for their use, but must be reforged by humans to exert its power on the surface.

* Edit: Why did the Master Sword become the Goddess Sword? In every other game, it was called the Master Sword from the beginning, even if it wasn't at its full power.

* How important are the Three Dragons to the Triforce and Hylian mythology? As I understood, they watched over the surface while the Hylians remained in Skyloft, and together with Levias, guarded the melody which would awaken the Master Sword. But while they have obvious connections with the Goddesses Din, Nayru and Farore, who created Hyrule and the Triforce, the Dragons were not guardians of the Triforce, which remained hidden in the caverns of Skyloft. Is their disappearance from other games due to their gradual loss of relevance, especially once Hyrule returns to the surface?",,False,,t5_2tfzp,1359675531.0,,,True,t3_17ne5g,http://www.reddit.com/r/truezelda/comments/17ne5g/spoilers_xpost_bonus_manga_in_hyrule_historia/,

These are the words Demise utters when you defeat him in Skyward Sword. Now, this would imply that Demise is incarnated into Ganon, but I'm having some troubles with this. In Ocarina of Time Gannondorf is clearly born before Zelda and Link and he wants the triforce.

It seems like it's the other way around. Ganon was born first and later Zelda and Link are born since the world now ""needs"" them to defeat this evil.

Also, in the timeline where Ganon wins which should fulfill the curse, a new Link is born to take down Ganon. That's a pretty bad curse.

To me it just seems like this is something Demise would say to mock Link when in fact, it's the other way around. A hero is born because he is needed, not because Demise cursed them to be born.

* One thing I noticed right away in the E3 trailer (I'm only catching up now, sorry) is that the magic meter is now purple! Compare the two sets of screenshots [here](http://zeldawiki.org/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_A_Link_Between_Worlds). Pre-E3 it was green like every other magic meter since A Link to the Past but now it's purple. Could this mean anything? Perhaps your magic meter gets upgraded at one point in the game (A gift from a fairy or from Nayru?) and changes colour.
* [Eastern Palace is in it.](http://zeldawiki.org/File:ALBW_E3_4.png)
* [Link's house is in it.](http://zeldawiki.org/File:ALBW_E3_3.png)
* [Despite that Aonuma has said it's not the same Link and Zelda as A Link to the Past](http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/125062-A-Link-Between-Worlds-Is-Not-a-Sequel-But-Not-a-Remake-Either). So it probably takes place one or two generations later before Hyrule has changed too much.
* [Official artwork shows Link with the Master Sword and Hylian Shield](http://zeldawiki.org/File:Link-ALBW.png). That pretty much kills the ""Master Sword Sleeps Forever"" thing as being true on that timeline, though it's still weird considering the Master Sword should be golden after A Link to the Past.

[Theory] [Spoilers],24,4,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/truezelda/comments/1jg1ai/the_realm_of_labrynna_ooa_was_the_same_land_found/,"This is going to cause some disagreements, as all references to the timeline do. But please read and consider the possibility.

[**The official timeline for reference**](http://www.zeldadungeon.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Hyrule-Historia-Timeline-translated-Graphics.jpg)

**Lets Begin With [Labrynna](http://zeldawiki.org/Labrynna):**

If you don't know about Labrynna, it's the country that Link visits and saves in ""The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages"" (Hence forth referred to as OoA). In OoA you travel to the past and future to save the realm or Labrynna, but we will focus on the past map for this since it's closer to the Ocarina of Time origin in the timeline split. [In the past it is a large realm, with a town in the center where a giant tower is being built to touch the heavens, a mountain to the North East, a large southern and South Eastern coast, and a strange balancing mountain in the North West](http://www.zeldauniverse.net/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/OoA-Labrynna-Past.png). The balancing mountain in the North West is a strange concept, so let me explain. It is like a giant platform balancing on the top of a mountaintop, and is threatening to topple over at any moment. The people even mirror each others’ lives, from East to West, so that the land doesn’t tip in either direction.

**Labrynna in the Distant Future:**

Scouring the Zelda 2 map, I searched for a location that would fit with Labrynna, to try to connect the games across the timeline. When I did, a possible bleak future for Labrynna was painted. Now remember that this paper is a theory based in established game lore, so take it with an extra grain of salt.

To see what I saw, Examine [this map of the world in Zelda 2](http://i290.photobucket.com/albums/ll248/BEASTMASTERTOAD/Hyrule_AoL_1.gif). Look closely at Mido Town, The King's Tomb, and the Island Palace, as well as the land just beyond the mountains to the North West. The land geography is the same as that of Labrynna. *If this is where Labrynna used to be*, then the future of Labrynna is to become a giant desert, *filled* with graves of the dead. In the center, where the tower should be, we see the King's Tomb, but we see no tower. What could have killed so many people that it would leave a graveyard [nearly the size](http://www.zeldauniverse.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/z1and2compare.jpg) of [Hyrule](http://imageshack.us/a/img709/1402/oldhyrulemap.png)? And why is there such a large path through the mountains in the North West? And if [that *is* Hyrule in the original Zelda game](http://www.zeldauniverse.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/z1and2compare.jpg), then what happened to it?

Imagine if the balancing land in the North West mountains were to collapse. What would happen? The impact of such a massive object would cause a giant earth quake, which would collapse the tower, and might be what is to blame for the destruction of the realm and death of nearly every person in Labrynna. And how would that effect the rest of the world? Such an Earth quake could *potentially* cause a tsunami powerful enough to wash an entire kingdom, Hyrule kingdom, off of the map! And perhaps in the Downfall Era [Rauru wasn't there to protect the world from the flood waters, like he did when the goddesses flooded Hyrule in the Adult Era](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_The_Wind_Waker). After all, the presence of the Kings Tomb in Zelda 2 confirms that Rauru was already dead by that time at least. It is assumed that Ganon killed him in the original Zelda game when he captured Zelda. But that is not confirmed.

This would explain the barren wasteland of Hyrule that we see in the original Legend of Zelda, *and* tie in the existence of Labrynna to the same world.

**The Mountain Collapse, and the Flood:**

In the Adult era, at the beginning of Wind Waker (WW), it is said that Hyrule was flooded, and 1000 years passed since then. When taken at face value, it appears that the legend in WW of the flood happened relatively soon after OoT. But when considered again, you may note that it never says how long it took Ganon to return the second time. Perhaps, the same amount of time passed between OoT, and the legend at the beginning of WW as passed between OoT and the moment that the mountain *potentially* collapsed in Labrynna. 

To clarify what that would imply: the same mountain collapsing caused the barren Hyrule in the original game, *and* the flooded world in WW (With Hyrule protected by a bubble). The same amount of water would clear out one version of Hyrule, as would be held above the other version. And the water would never absorb into that land in WW to clear away, because it is held up by the bubble. Now I’m not saying that the Goddesses didn’t cause the flood. But this could be the Goddesses’ method for flooding Hyrule, and would make sense to have happened in the Adult Era as well as the Downfall Era, considering Ganon’s presence in each.

Not only does the mountain collapse conveniently fit well into its own timeline, and explains the difference in the world throughout that timeline, but it also links the events of the Downfall Era with the events of the Adult Era through a natural disaster that would have happened eventually in each.

Then, at the end of Wind Waker, those waters finally subside when they flood old Hyrule. But if the waters subsided, where is Labrynna in the Adult Era?

**Labrynna in the Adult Era:**

In WW, we know that the world above Hyrule is a flooded wasteland, with small populated islands. After choosing to flood the old Hyrule, and make a new land, the people in WW move on across the sea. In Phantom Hourglass we see that the people from the WW world sail away to explore new lands, and rebuild their ancient Kingdom, but they hit a bit of a snag in the form of the Ghost Ship. After Link solves that problem, the people of that era move on again, and find a great new land.

When the water flooded Hyrule, it also uncovered the land found in the Spirit Tracks prologue by the descendents of the islanders from WW. There, Hyrule is reformed. When examining [the map](http://filemanager.linkshideaway.com/staff_files/larke12/images/z15overworld.png) of [that world](http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7188/6901251795_63f37c1ca6_o.jpg), however, we see that it greatly resembles [the map of Labrynna]( http://www.zeldauniverse.net/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/OoA-Labrynna-Past.png), and that same section on [the Zelda 2 map](http://i290.photobucket.com/albums/ll248/BEASTMASTERTOAD/Hyrule_AoL_1.gif)! All of the same locations match up, except for the area in the North West, which is now a snowy region. Could that be the ancient ruins of the balancing mountain that caused the floods? Could the tower in Labrynna, the King’s Tomb, and the tower in New Hyrule all be coincidentally built in the same location?

**Now, I’m not suggesting that the newly established Hyrule is the old Labrynna directly. Here is my thought simplified:**
&gt;Could the old ruined land of Labrynna, with its tower long destroyed by the flood, be the same landmass found in Spirit Tracks? Could the new tower that was built to lock away Malladus be built upon the ruins of the old tower at the heart of Labrynna? Is this same land mass that same one found in Zelda 2, the game that has the most inclusive world to date, and which seems to have the King’s Tomb located in the same place as those two towers?

So here it is:    
    

I believe the three splits from OoT already represent each of the series' lead characters: - Ganondorf wins = LTTP, Zelda's timeline (adult timeline of OoT that Link leaves at the end of the game) = Wind Waker timeline and Link's childhood timeline = majora's mask

Thus the idea of the three splits being different 'parts' of the triforce could also align with each characters' timeline/their piece of the triforce (power, wisdom and courage)
And why not have an ultimate ending link who joins it all back again? Doesn't mean Nintendo can't put more games between all the gaps- and it would place more value on the events of OoT and its timeline splitting. I.e the events of OoT are so epic, that fucking time and space divided and it wasn't until this theoretical game that the universe is 'fixed' again.

This corruption of space and time also nicely accounts for all the different ways time behaves across different Zelda games (I.e majora's mask being a loop, OoT being a weird past and future thing, even skyward sword's time globe things) - maybe even when Demise first game to fuck shit up, that was the beginning of time and space getting fucked up in the universe of Zelda and thus from that point Hyrule was doomed to eventually live out the events of OoT (history repeating itself because time is trying to be linear but link keeps resetting Ganon's attempts of domination) and thus in this theoretical game you are being the ultimate Link who undoes all of the universe warping started all tet time before?

And then, as an ultimate headfuck, Link from this game should go on to become like, the ultimate God/father of time and since he's 'fixing' the universe, he 'creates' the universe and the end of this game reveals to be just before Demise's original attacks on the earth. Link gets lazy, Hylia has to step in and it eventually leads to the semi-wasteland of skyward sword, with lanaryu being reminenents of God Link's world... Thus all of the timeline forms a super symbolic loop of events - which also explains why some od the imagery is consistent throughout the games

Is this just crazy talk or do you guys think this is at all a good idea?

So, I was thinking that it would be really awesome to have a future Zelda game set sometime after OoT.  This game would span all three timelines, and a la Chrono Cross, Link could jump between the parallel realities created by the timeline splits in OoT.  This would create a really cool way to have mirrored worlds without revisiting the Light/Dark world and/or time traveling.  Just like the Light/Dark world, events in each parallel reality would affect each other.  This could create for some really cool puzzles like the water temple in ALttP.  This game could either come before WW, TP, and ALttP (which would make Hyrule in all three realities a very similar place), or it could come at the end of all three timelines (thus Hyrule would be dramatically different in each reality) and be a story of how Link ""reintegrates"" the parallel dimensions into a single reality.

After I thought of this idea for a game, I realized it would fit really nicely into Zelda lore, and would actually help explain some plot holes in TP.  The biggest plot hole is that TP takes place in the child timeline and in that timeline, Ganondorf never actually touches the Triforce, thus it should still be resting in the Sacred Realm.  However, for some reason, in TP Link, Zelda, and Ganondorf all have the Triforce marks on their hands, and Ganondorf seems to have powers that were only granted to him by the Triforce of Power (e.g., not being killed easily; being able to transform into Ganon).  If Nintendo were to establish that events in one timeline affect other timelines, then this plot hole could be explained by saying that in the adult timeline, Ganondorf grabbed the Triforce, causing it to split and each part to dwell within Ganondorf, Zelda, and Link.  This action could have rippled over into the child timeline, which caused Ganondorf, Zelda, and Link to have the Triforce pieces in TP, despite no one ever touching it.",,False,,t5_2tfzp,False,,,True,t3_153507,http://www.reddit.com/r/truezelda/comments/153507/zelda_theory_and_game_idea/,

This seems fair enough considering how differently Termina is structured (it has its own set of four guardians, its own unique moon etc.).

My issue is with recurring characters between the two universes. There are many examples here, such as the Happy Mask Salesman, the cuckoo lady (""Anju"" in Majora's Mask), Sakon the thief (originally found prancing in the Hyrule marketplace) etc. If Termina is indeed a parallel universe, then it makes sense that these characters could be found in both Hyrule and Termina at the same time (it doesn't make sense to assume that a swarm of characters from Hyrule all decided to travel to Termina, especially considering that child Link ensured Hyrule didn't fall to Ganondorf).

My problem is that Link (and perhaps the Happy Mask Salesman) seem to break the rules here. Link somehow manages to travel between the two universes, meaning he only exists in one at a time. All the other characters, however, seem to exist in both simultaneously (assuming everyone didn't collectively bail on Hyrule).

I get that the developers most likely did this for the sake of including a few familiar faces in Majora's Mask, which is fun. However, it seems to contradict how Link can only exist in one universe at a time.

Background: I grew up with Zelda and my brother and I played a lot of the games, loving OOT the most. For some reason, I remember taking particular interest in the Shadow Temple and its boss ""Bongo Bongo"". 

Grown up now, I just recently played through the game and noticed more of the subtle background story regarding the ""man who could see the truth"". The numerous theories regarding nature of the shadow temple as being ""torture/jail"" for people during the ""civil war"" and Bongo's appearance as a creature with a cut off head and hands. I have connected some of the pieces myself but to be completely honest, I am not qualified to write about this ""Hyrulean Civil War"" or about the nature of Kakariko Village being a Sheikah village for some time before some event.  

So, what I intend to to: 

Write a full length novel regarding the background story of Bongo Bongo and his tragedy and rise.

This will be similar to what ""The Protomen"" did with the Mega Man story. Link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Protomen  

I know at some point there will be conflicting theories, so I will lay the base structure down now. 


The man who could see the truth will be named ""Gabora"" (Tribute to Majora's Mask) and will eventually become Bongo Bongo

(reference http://zelda.wikia.com/wiki/Zubora_and_Gabora) 

Dampe, Guru, Anju, and Grog will be featured as children. A major plot point will explain why Grog grows to hate his parents 

The fabulously rich family will be a major role and mostly an antagonist. 
(a love interest with a family member will be the cause of most of the problems between Gabora and the family)

A class structure will make Sheikah's (who control the town) higher ranking than normal people. Gabora will be forbidden from ""seeing the truth"" due to his non-heritage (source for a lot of conflict)

Impa will be involved more and more as the story progresses until her conflict with Gabora becomes clear. 

Other OOT references will be made, some funny and some interesting. 

Ganondorf will not be featured. I am taking the path that Bongo Bongo came to power on his own and was sealed away by Impa. His release when Ganondorf comes to power is beyond the scope of the books time frame. 

(Suggestions welcome). 


HELP WANTED:
I have read a lot of articles on the two zelda wikis and they proved to be extremely useful in filling in the gaps. 

But my story lacks research in some fields. 

The civil war is mentioned in a lot of the games so I would like your input on what parts may be important or essential to Kakariko Village or the theories regarding the purpose of the shadow temple. 

Any information on the symbolism seen inside the shadow temple and the Sheikah's. The lens of truth will play a major role in how Gabora learns to ""see the truth"". 

Names for family members of the ""Fabulously Rich Family"". Since there are none and I can't come up with any that sound realistic for a zelda game. I need a father, mother, and 3-4 sons/daughters. (at least one daughter for Gabora) 

Some kind of explanation for Dampe. (origins, life, graveyard history) 

And the most important, timing.
I don't know the dates of the civil war or when the Sheikahs owned the village.

So far...
Gabora is 17
Impa 17
Guru-Guru 8
Dampe 13
Shikashi 40
Anju 8
Grog 7 
Mutoh 21
Granny 53   

This novel will take time to compile the research but once the entire plot is set in stone (lol), I can begin writing

EDIT: Impa is now older due to her being the one who opened Kakariko to the normal people  

UPDATE: Story is ready. Writing has begun and contributers will be credited. Novel will be released for free

Today I was thinking about the Twilight Realm. It is basically the reverse world of the world of light right? 

I looked into the history of the Twilight Realm and it was where the evil users of dark magic were banished to. Now, the people have forgotten of their past of trying to rule the light world and they are living normally as are the people in the light world. So the light world and Twilight Realm aren't all that different. 

Zant attacked the light world out of hatred and tried to engulf that land in twilight. This made me think. Since Zant came in with the help of Gannondorf, could somebody from the light world attack the Twilight Realm? 

What if there was a Hylian who was so corrupt and full of hatred he attacked the Twilight Realm? Since both worlds are two sides of the same coin, and neither can survive without the other, Link would have to go on a quest to save the twilight realm. I know it is easy to think of the Twilight Realm as evil since Dark is often associated with Evil, but in this case, the Twilight Realm is just another world. It has cities and kingdoms.

I know that the mirror of Twilight was destroyed in the end of TP, but couldn't it still exist in the hero's decline timeline? It probably wouldn't exist in the adult timeline, but who knows? Maybe it is sitting at the bottom of the great sea waiting to be found.

1358752997.0,14,self.truezelda,16z7xw,An Electric Dungeon,21,7,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/truezelda/comments/16z7xw/an_electric_dungeon/,"After reading another post about different/new types of dungeons we would like to see in Zelda, I came up with an idea for an electric themed dungeon:

To start with, there would be graphics/hieroglyphics on the walls,floors or ceiling in each room. But not in plain sight. These graphics/hieroglyphics should be in inconspicuous places. For example behind some pots. Followed by different pieces of equipment to rotate/move/pickup. What these graphics do is demonstrate what each piece of equipment does as well as Series/Parallel connections.

For those who don't know, these connections in the dungeon only deal with Voltage and Current. In series the Current is the same all around the circuit but the Voltage is split. In parallel, the Voltage is the same and the Current is split. An example of the graphic could show that connecting a wire from the source to the box opens up the box. Except in a ""Zelda"" way, not necessarily a box.

The equipment would represent real life equipment such as AC/DC source, resistors, transformers, diodes, wires etc. Maybe not wires but something very similar like moving tiles to carry the current.

Now in every room there is an x amount of boxes followed by wires/tiles to connect to the box. This puzzle would be very simple, get the current from the DC source (a block you can move around) through the wire/tiles to the closed box. The box is energized and opens revealing a key/item. Another puzzle could be similar except now you have an AC source which comes out of the wall, like the receptacle you plug you phone charger in.

The next few rooms could deal with resistors (objects you can pick up and drop), which limit the current going through the wire/tiles to reach the box. If the right amount of current reaches the box, it opens and if not something bad as in Link being shocked/burned as resistors can get pretty hot, or enemies spawn etc. 

Moving on the puzzles get harder such as using transformers. Instead of getting the right current to x boxes, now link has to get the right voltage to x boxes. But transformers have ratios for stepping up/down voltages. As in a 2:1 transformer would cut 480V to 240V. 

The dungeon gets more complicated now as diodes (place able and rotatable objects) are taken into account. A diode lets current pass from one side but not the other. 

Then comes relays and contacts. There are 2 contacts, NO and NC (normally open and closed respectively), and x amount of relays. A NO contact allows current to pass while a NC doesn't Once a relay is energized, the contacts reverse their state. For example a NC becomes a NO when the relay is energized. To make things harder some rooms require a seal-in contact. These contacts are the same except they stay in their new state even when the relay has been de-energized. 

Of course throughout the dungeon, there would be obstacles to overcome such as kill all the stalfos in the room before you have access to the equipment. And obviously the final part of the dungeon would put all of this together into one big puzzle.

1358166460.0,15,self.truezelda,16jqot,Yet another Majora's Mask theory.,28,13,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/truezelda/comments/16jqot/yet_another_majoras_mask_theory/,"Having just finished my playthrough of Majora's Mask, I've had a braingasm that I feel the need to share. This is probably obvious to most people, but I'm thick, so indulge me, if you will.

A little explanation is required for this one. So, when Skyward Sword was released in Japan an encyclopedia about Zelda was also released: Hyrule Historia. This book, among other things, contains THE definitive timeline to the Zelda series, the holy grail of utterly pointless video game factoids since the dawn of time.

The timeline confirms the existence of what many fans had speculated since Ocarina of Time: that the timeline split at the end of Ocarina of Time. In one timeline, Link loses to Ganon, and he takes over, leading to A Link to the Past. However, the other split is far more interesting. After defeating Ganon at the end of Ocarina, Zelda send Link back to his childhood to live the childhood he missed. This created two timelines, one for Zelda in the future after Ganon is overthrown, and one where Link and Zelda stop Ganondorf from taking over in the first place. Ignoring the insane amount of paradoxes that would inevitably erupt from this, we have confirmation that travelling back in time does create parallel timelines.

What does this have to do with Majora? Well, let me say it, pure and simple.

Every single time Link uses the Song of Time to travel back to the start of the 3 days, he abandons Termina to it's fate, dooming the world to destruction at the hands...er...face...of the moon. Every time you use the Song of Time in Majora's Mask, you are, inadvertently, causing the deaths of thousands, possible millions, because Termina is kinda abstract and it's hard to tell just how many people actually live there.

But wait! It gets better!

With this knowledge in hand, you're probably thinking ""oh, I'll just rush through the game, won't use the song of time"". But, here's the thing: you already do. In the first cycle, you have no choice but to use the Song of Time and abandon Termina to it's fate. And even then, it is basically impossible to go through the rest of the game without using the Song of Time a few times, so inevitably, more and more terminas, and the people in them, are gonna die.

But wait! It gets better!

How many times have you reversed the clock in order to do a side-quest? How many times have you used the song of time in order to do things that have nothing to do with your quest to save the world, or even just to see how they turn out without your intervention? Quite a lot, in my case. That means that you are letting the world die, just to fix the problems of a tiny handful of people, only so that they die in a day or two anyway. Sure, you could use the reverse song of time to give yourself more time, but you're still delaying the inevitable. That moon's gonna fall. And there's only one way to stop it. It may seem cruel, but if you want to save as many people as possible, if you want the least amount of Terminas to die, then you may just have to ignore all these people who need your help. The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few, after all.

But wait! It gets better!

Given all this knowledge, I came to one, horrifying realization.

It is better, in the long run, to let Termina die in the First Cycle without playing the Song of Time. Because, if you do play it, you're just condemning more people to their fate. If you seek to preserve life, then playing the song of time is the worst thing you can do. It is arguably better, in the long run, for Link to wait for death atop the Clock Tower. If Link himself realizes this, there are only really two motivations Link can have for continuing on his quest:

1) Having a compulsive need to find one saved Termina atop the pile of countless dead

or

2) Purely selfishly: Link wants to find the one timeline where he himself can survive.

And then, atop all that, the worst thing about this? It may not be a theory. Given what we know about Time Travel due to the Hyrule Historia and Ocarina of Time, this could very well be Canonical, aside from maybe the last point, because that's just my interjection on the situation. Still though, I wonder if Nintendo knew just how horrifying the levels of Fridge Horror the Zelda timeline has created.

Lifelong Zelda gamer here.  Beat all of the games that came out prior to OoT.  Zelda LttP was tied with Super Metroid for my favorite game back when those were more current.

Was excited as everyone else for Zelda to go 3D.  When I played OoT I didn't care for it as much as I expected.  Combat felt way clunkier than LttP, the camera gave me issues, that owl was annoying, and I didn't enjoy some of the level design like jabu jabu and water temple, which is the furthest I got.

MM I didn't get into because the time mechanic was kind of annoying, but I remember enjoying the deku dungeon.  Didn't get too far in this one, played more Soul Calibur than Zelda that year...

Wind Waker I loved.  The mechanics felt much smoother and they gave you way more camera control.  I loved the art style and I loved all the throwbacks they included referencing older games.  For some stupid reason I sold my GC right before I beat Metroid Prime 2 and getting through the Temple of the Gods or whatever you enter after the 3 pearls are collected in WW.

TP I tried out on Wii and hate it so far.  I beat the first dungeon and it was a complete cakewalk, much easier than WW which was already in the easy side.  Dog sections and Midna's ramblings got old quick, and it feels like its taking forever to get moving.

-----------

Currently trying to change all that.

Had planned to go through them all again in order.  Played OoT up to the Forest Temple, then came across a good condition used copy of Wind Waker.  Been playing that since.

I've gotten the Master Sword and am sailing to the two temples now.  I really liked the scenes with the master sword and king of lions / zelda, they threw in tons of remixed oldschool Zelda tunes like Zeldas Lullaby and the intro fanfare to LttP.  I'm excited to play through this one finally.

I think after Wind Waker I will go back and try to play through OoT and MM for the first time.  I feel pretty dumb owning OoT on cartridge and GC DVD and never finishing it.

Is there anything I need to know from either 64 game as far as story goes while playing WW?

He meets up with Zelda and they start doing their thing to destroy evil but as Link gets closer the power starts to eat at his heart and ultimately destroying it. This would require a much more truly in-depth game in order for the transition to be smooth for if it wasn't a smooth transition then it would be an utter fail. 

Link could start off like an every day child, well not everyday child because he would almost NEED to be an orphan for the transition to be believable for the ever enduring Link. Zelda would also have to be a more controlling character than ever seen before. As Link gets more power through beating the dungeons his childhood horrors flash back to him. Maybe he was beaten as a child by his ""authority figures."" At one point he could attempt to get the Master Sword at Zelda's pressure to hurry. When he failed to get the sword it drives him to questioning his person and at that point he starts to get more and more involved in his own well being. As the story progresses he distances himself from Zelda and becomes his own ""man"" for the first time. He loves the freedom so much that he loses track of the quest and defeat of evil. Demise being the ""evil"" entity that it is then starts to put fears in impressionable mind of Link. At one point Link gets captured and that's where Demise turns him evil. Afterwards Link goes after Zelda in the castle (dungeon in itself) and when he reaches her, Link either 
A. Realizes what he is doing and comes back to the good side and at this point is finally able to obtain the Master Sword and continues his quest to destroy evil (keep in mind it would be nowhere near as simple as that)

B. (and you guys are really not going to like this one) He actually kills Zelda, and this sends him into a state of manic depression, He repents and goes back to the location of the Master Sword and just cries. When the tear hits the soil Hylia appears and explains that hope is not lost and Link gets back and takes the Sword and continues to destroy evil. (Zelda could not see this in his heart in the beginning for she is a mere human albeit Hylia's reincarnation but a still a human.) Hylia saw this coming for she knew that only after your darkest can you see light the brightest. (personally my favorite of the two)

I know it's a lot more movie-esque than gaming but with the way things are heading I could one hundred percent see being plausible. However I would not like this idea being a choose your own destiny because I think it would take away from the underlying theme in the game.

As we all know, Link doesn't speak in his games, and is meant to be an 'avatar' for the player. As such, he lacks detailed characterization. However, apart from the common traits of courage and heroism, unique sparks of personality can be found between the Links. Is there any particular personality trait you realised a Link had?

- For example, when I played through Ocarina of Time, I always had it in my head that this Link was a bit shy, and felt like a loner. Perhaps this was because he seemed to be a bit unused to people being kind to him, or engaging with others (running away from Ruto, Gorons, etc). Him being ostracized from the Kokiri further added to this.

- Twilight Princess Link appears to be tenacious, feral even, which corresponds with his form as  a wolf. He acts like a protector to the children of Ordon Village; however there is always the underlying sense that his ferocity is out of love.

Your thoughts? You can discuss any of the Links from any of the games.

This means that he can be defeated by relatively convencional means: The imprisonment war, where he is sealed by the sages. In other games, however, he has the triforce of power, making him super powerful. Therefore, should Link die, the outcome is simply that ganon takes over the world.

So the map overlay post from a couple days ago got me thinking about my position on Hyrule's geography. Personally, I really enjoy how the TP map vaguely echoes the OoT map (given how similar the two are, this is hardly surprising), but I'd never seen the Wind Waker comparison, which is also awesome. Still, when the maps are just *so similar*, but too different to accurately be called the same, it bothers me on a minor level.

I've heard it posited everywhere that perhaps, in keeping with the word ""legend"" in the title, that each game in the series is simply a retelling of the same story, but I've never been a fan of that idea; after all, recent games seem to be gearing towards creating a sprawling continuity, and I love that about the series. Helps the world feel more alive, I guess.

So how to reconcile the constantly shifting map with a legit continuity? My take on it is that while the series as a whole is one giant, multi-part story, each *installment* is simply a telling of each part of the legend. In other words, in the Child Timeline (for example), Ocarina of Time happens, then a ways down the line, Twilight Princess happens. In the ""real"" Hyrule (insofar as there can be a real Hyrule), the geography is entirely consistent between the two stories; whether it matches one or the other or if it's something in between or entirely different doesn't matter. But when these games come out, the way the storyteller (Nintendo) presents Hyrule is entirely up to them.

This also accounts for things like graphical differences (WW takes place in the same timeline as OoT, after all) and inexperienced players spending tens of minutes stubbornly running at a wall. Basically, each game and player file is a presentation of how an event in Hylian history went down, but the ""true canon"" is more of a broad strokes kind of thing.

Okay, so I've spent quite a bit of space on a one-sentence explanation, but I'm trying to cover all my bases here...what's everyone think about this?

He is an eight foot tall, possible god, character that Link can transform into using Fierce Deity's Mask.

For those of you that don't know, The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask is a direct sequel from it's previous game, The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. In Majora's Mask, Link gets mutated into a Deku Scrub, a small wooden creature. Eventually, Link gets the curse lifted from him. So the Deku Scrub gets trapped trapped inside a mask. Allowing Link to change between his hylian (basically the same concept as human) form and deku scrub form. Throughout the game, Link obtains two more masks transforming him into a Goron, (a rock creature) and a Zora (a fish creature). He also obtains twenty non-transformation masks, most of which are optional to obtain. In the end of the game, Link goes to the moon and meets different children there. If he has all twenty non-transformation masks, he can obtain the Fierce Deity's Mask. 


Fierce Deity, or Oni Link, means exactly what the name is: menacing god. ""Could this mask's dark powers be as bad as Majora?"" Says the in-game description on Fierce Deity. Personally, I believe, and most people believe, that Fierce Deity is stronger than Majora. ""He is the true bad guy"" says one of the children on the moon. They're probably right. As when Link finally fights Majora using Fierce Deity's Mask is so easy to defeat Majora. Kijin no Kamen is the Japanese name for Fierce Deity, which translates exactly to Devil God's Mask. This definitely determines that Fierce Deity is a demonic, evil god.

Oni Link (a nickname for Fierce Deity) means many things from Japanese. Oni means a large monster, usually red, pink, or blue-gray, with horns, three fingers, three toes, or in certain occasions three eyes. Though I don't know how he got his nickname to be Oni Link, I can support the name. Fierce Deity's clothes is a dark-blue, and his ""third eye"" could be the blue indentation in between his eyes.

Theories

One theory suggests that Majora wanted someone to get the mask, as to make them go mad with power, thus joining Majora's ""army"". However, Link did not get possessed because he has will-power and has a kind heart. (as he does in every Zelda game.) so Majora did not see this coming and got overwhelmed.

Majora could just be messing with Link, as he never does kill him right away on their encounters. For example, Majora turns Link into a Deku at the beginning, rather than killing him. Or how he makes the moon fall in a short amount of three days, rather than speeding it up or finding a different way to bring doomsday. Or how he basically gave Link Fierce Deity's Mask. This all could be a sense of fair play. But then again, facts can also oppose this. The reason Majora did not turn Link into a deku rather then killing him could be that he did not know he was a threat at the time. So he turned him into a deku scrub for his amusement. The reason he made the moon fall is that he wanted an interesting way to kill everyone, and he couldn't speed it up because he didn't know how. The reason to oppose Fierce Deity's Mask is that he didn't know it existed, or as I said earlier he could've given it to him as a sense of fair play. When you put this theory in perspective however, it seems much more likely for him to be playing games with Link.

Fierce Deity could be Link's Terminan counterpart, as Dark Link is assumably Link's Hylian counterpart. This is highly likely due to the fact that each Hylian has a Terminan counterpart, Like Malon (Hylian) to Romani (Terminan).

In the beginning, when Link comes back to the Happy Mask Salesman after he retrieves his Ocarina of Time, He tells him more about Majora's Mask. He says a ""Hexed Tribe"" sealed away Majora's Mask and worshiped a deity. I believe this hexed tribe might be the Twili or Shiekah. The Deity they worshiped could possibly be Fierce Deity. The reason he got sent in a mask is that he was too strong so the goddesses banished him into the mask.

Majora could possibly altogether just be simply insane. He could possibly have made the moon fall for his own sick pleasure. Or he could make Link go through everything because Majora is mad. Majora could just give Link the mask because as said earlier, he is insane.

Conclusion


To conclude this, what I believe is that Fierce Deity was worshiped by the Twili or the Sheikah, but got banished into the mask. He is also Link's Terminan Counterpart. He is stronger than Majora and has his own kind of power, his own kind of Triforce of Power. He is not evil nor good, but he works alone, not for Majora or Ganondorf or anyone. Majora is only a distraction and the real enemy, is Fierce Deity.

-----

To add,

I was using the Triforce of Power as an example. I now think that the Triangle on Fierce Deity's armor resembles the triforce and hyrule, whereas the crescent moon on his armor resembles termina. I.e. Link's destiny in Hyrule and his destiny in Termina. I also think that (as mentioned earlier) Fierce Deity is Link's Terminan counterpart.

[if we look at the ending of OoT](http://i.imgur.com/j9KtU.jpg) we'll see that Link brought the triforce of courage back with him, which would mean the adult timeline would be without a triforce of courage. The child timeline will have the full triforce and an extra courage one that Link brought back.

Now I know it's probably nitpicking but this whole timetravel thing doesn't seem that thought through which is a shame since I really like timetravel done right. I've been trying to think of something that would explain why it's suddenly there in WW (broken into pieces though), but I can't come up with something? Any theories?

*EDIT* Thank you all for having an opinion on this, it was a real pleasure to read through it all :D

Anyway, as caiodepauli pointed out, the glowing hand means you have been chosen by the gods as shown in SS (which I didn't know, it's one of the few I haven't played yet, but definately will) so this leaves me with my own theory. When OoT Link is transported back his on timeline the triforce of courage is ""taken"" from him and broken into pieces as seen in wind waker. He still has a mark though, since he has been chosen by the gods. This, however, also means there is proof the triforce has been touched, which which it will break apart in this timeline explaining the ""divine prank"" that gives Ganon the triforce of power at his execution (which also bothered me a little since I wanted a reason for that happening other than just ""it happened"" :D)",,False,,t5_2tfzp,1351837221.0,,,True,t3_12e8at,http://www.reddit.com/r/truezelda/comments/12e8at/why_is_the_triforce_of_courage_in_ww/,

Whether it is ocarina of time/majora's mask with its manga art style, or wind waker and the sequels with the cartoony look, we normally get similar art styles with the same ""story arcs"" so to speak.

Say, ocarina and majora's

Wind waker and the DS games

TLOZ, TAOL, ALTTP, LA &amp; oracle games (I think that the link on these games is the same one, but if I'm wrong please correct me)

What do you guys think will be the next art style the series will take? Most of the fans are on their late to early 20s (I suppose) since this is a 26 year old franchise, so at least for most of us it would be great to have something nitty and gritty, like the katsuya terada art for the late 80s/early 90s installments.


http://www.giantbomb.com/the-legend-of-zelda/62-9/katsuya-teradas-zelda-artwork/52-103557/

It might be a bit too 80s and it gives an akira/bladerunner feel for some strange reason even though those are sci fi/steampunk (A future/steampunk zelda would be too much of a departure in my opinon and the essence would be lost) but it would be interesting to see something like this. Since the art direction is most of the time related to feel of the game (as said by Matthewmatosis, go watch his videos if you haven't), an older link, such as the hero's shade on its last days if it didn't get lost on the woods would be a great opportunity for a darker zelda with an older link.

Any ideas on what kind of art direction you would like the series to have on future installments, and how it could be justified

I know this subreddit was created specifically to part ways with shitty Zelda posts, so let me know if you feel this doesn't belong and I'll delete. But give it a look, because I truly believe this is the most detailed, respectful-to-the-games LoZ film proposal on reddit, and could inspire some great discussions. The film has Link speak only in simple phrases like ‘yes’, ‘no,’ and his name. Stylistically, this would be done closer to the lavish and fanciful aesthetic of filmmakers [Tarsem](http://imgur.com/a/ARlIw) and [Jordorowsky](http://imgur.com/a/yQa6Y/layout/blog), rather than the dark &amp; gritty style of Jackson’s LoTR. Think exuberant colors, iconographic imagery, and crowded shot compositions. Please don’t hesitate to tear this apart! I’m curious to know what true LoZ fans have to say. 

**For those not up for the read, the nutshell synopsis is as follows-** *A stoic and amnesic Link is cast adrift in a nightmarish OoT Hyrule, where he, Rauru, Zelda, and others must free the sages from Ganondorf's prisons/temples. The premise is that Link is the equivalent of a guardian angel of Hyrule/Termina/Windfall etc., who is 'deployed' into the world during times of war and occupation to restore balance to the Triforce (the Hero of Time). The story begins as 'Link's Awakening,' with Link lying on driftwood in the middle of the sea with no memory. After washing ashore on Koholint Island where he meets Marin and Tarin (who give him Epona), he sails to Hyrule. With the aid of Rauru, Zelda, Saria, and Impa, Link subsequently traverses the Fire Temple and the Water Temple, freeing Darunia the Goron and Ruto the Zora. As Ganondorf sees his defeat at the hands of the seven sages is imminent, he sends forces to kidnap Princess Zelda, thus forcing Link into a one-on-one confrontation.

Swedish game magazine Level has (as world first) seen what is to be the new Legend of Zelda for wii u. This is all a few months old, but I haven't seen it anywhere on the interwebs, so I guess we vikings just aren't happy about sharing stuff :)

So, what it said regarding the next Zelda game.

First of all it will be the biggest and most expensive game Nintendo has ever produced (as you already know). Every single region in the game will be bigger and have more content than all of Ocarina of Time. Also the compass will supposedly be useful in some way.
&gt;I search my pocket for the compass. The item that previously had a pretty much useless function has become my best friend. I wouldn't survive a day without it in this enormous unforgiving world.

^ Translated from swedish ^

But the most important part, what will separate it the most from other Zelda games, is that you can play as any race you want. Each race will have a different story-line and different play styles. This leads to the puzzles in dungeons having multiple solutions. Now tell me this isn't the most amazing thing you've ever heard.

As for the story and placement in the time-line, it takes place before Ocarina of Time and Link's quest is to help unite Hyrule, as the races can't get along and things will turn out as a bloody civil war if nothing is done. You might recall a war being mentioned in Ocarina's back-story as well.

I think this is about it. Just remember everything I've said is based on the 82nd issue of swedish game magazine Level.

Have fun :D

(I was waiting to find a GCN copy) My goddesses that game was easy. No a single enemy was threatening. Not one.

In Ocarina, running into the Lizalfos and the Wolfos was frightening. They were difficult and took a rather long time to defeat. They were an equal threat to Link. In TP, the combat favors you. Always. It only takes 3 hits of Master Sword to kill a Lizalfo, which is incredibly easy to do, considering the flinch mechanic. It feels like they didn't bother adjusting the combat to fit well with all the techniques you learn, and even tweaked it to be blatantly easier. I went into the final battle with 3 bottles of Fairy's Tears/Rare Chu Jelly, and a Fairy. I didn't lose 8 hearts throughout all 3 phases. Also, the secrets weren't that difficult to find. They were usually outlined pretty well throughout the world. I can't say they were the easiest in any Zelda game, though, as I made great use of the fortune teller.

Dungeons were another thing. Every Dungeon was streamlined and overall simple. I only got stumped maybe 3 times in all the Dungeons, and the only one I had genuine trouble with was the Lakebed Temple. I can't compare it well to OoT, as I've always had help with OoT whenever I played it throughout my childhood, but I'd imagine without help, Ocarina's Dungeons would be rather difficult.

I noticed a similar trend in Minish Cap. Compared to ALttP, MC is easy. Enemies aren't as quick, they die rather quickly, etc. Admittedly, Link to the Past wasn't a difficult game to begin with (excluding dungeons), but Minish Cap made it even easier. 

As far as Skyward Sword goes: It was actually rather difficult. However, I find it rather difficult to compare, as its mechanics were very different from other Zelda games. However, the biggest player in combat difficulty for it was the occasional unresponsiveness of the controller. Otherwise the biggest player was Fi's handholding.

Don't get me wrong, Twilight Princess is my favorite Zelda game to date. And I've yet to find a Zelda game I don't like for its mechanics. (I only dislike the DS titles for their canonical value.)

(Also my own thoughts),16,5,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/truezelda/comments/1kdto9/opinions_on_voice_acting_also_my_own_thoughts/,"Hey guys. Just wanted to know what you think of voice acting in the Zelda series. First off, let my clarify something right away and say that Link should never ever talk...ever.Obviously, here are my other thoughts on voice acting. I've never been wow'ed by voice acting in video games. There have been some voice actors in a few anime that have been alright. But even if one or two lines have been delivered very well, they are always accompanied by a plethora of really bad lines that take me out of the experience. This happens even more in video games in my opinion.

But focusing specifically on the Zelda series for a moment. Just think about Zelda's voice. Do you guys really want to ruin the voice you kind of make up in your head by replacing it with some voice actor? What if it isnt how you imagined it would be? Doesn't it take away from the imaginative ""link"" between the player and the game? Part of what make those games special is that you as the player must partake in the creation of the game. You breath life into Link, you imagine what the characters voices sound like, and you interpret and pick apart the dialogue they speak.

Additionally, if we have voice actors, it will take away from the dialogue itself. In order to save time, the writers will have to cut down on text so that we are not given long cut-scenes. From there, I imagine that we will be fed the same simplistic and bland dialogue that's delivered in our COD's and Gear's games.

My own idea is that the Interloper War takes place during MM, while Link is away from Hyrule. It is already known that a considerable amount of time passes between MM and TP (as child Link from MM appears to TP Link as an aged phantom), so I think that it would be ample time for th Twilight Realm to develop.

I've only played a few of the games so this list will be woefully incomplete.  
* first off Oot. This Link, based on his upbringing seems a bit aloof. The kokiri ostracized him and I think this gave him a thirst to prove himself, explaining his constant heroism. After his adventures in Termina, I believe the experience traumatized him somewhat and led him to settling down eventually(I like to think with Malon) after a few(smaller) adventures. He never really got over his experiences though, and maybe some obligations to his family(like working a ranch to provide steady income/helping citizens build new settlements near the forests?) made it impossible for him to turn back into the great hero he was once and so he died with a few regrets.  
* WW Link, to me, started out as the most childish. He had a carefree life: a grandma that would cook his favorite soup for him, a sister that looks up to and cares for him though she may think he was a bit of an idiot, all the other islanders obviously seem to care for him a great deal. All in all, he seems to be the happy-go-lucky type of guy. His adventure however forced him to grow up and mature, to be the kind of person that can reliably hold the world on his shoulders and still smile. New hyrule taking his uniform and turning it into a badge of honor for their knights makes me think that he grew up to be a great hero for the new land.  
* TP Link is one very cocky and show-offy person. He could be the handsome ranch hand that made the village girls swoon in a novella. He, however, had a hidden wild side to him and a certain restlessness that I think is the reason why he was chosen to be the one to go to castle town. I believe this Link would most likely join the ~~Companions~~ Resistance and adventure throughout all of Hyrule before eventually coming home and settling with Ilia.  
* MC Link, well, I don't have much to say about. He'd probably be a bit like WW Link but more quiet and sturdy being the nephew and most likely apprentice also, to a blacksmith. He might have a taste for the finer things though, since he's childhood friends with a princess. Seeing as they already have this kind of relationship and the fact that he saved from petrification, I'd see this Link has a likelihood of being a royal consort. 
So there are my thoughts, would definitely love to hear yours.

I love the top down, and how they're putting the spirit of the SNES games in it, but one thing bugs me.

Link is short and chubby in all the 2d games out of necessity. A top down perspective needs to show an interesting character, as all similar 2d games know, so it makes sense. But the art for all of those games still showed Link as a properly proportioned human being, even in the case of Cel shaded Link, in Phantom Hourglass and Spirit Tracks, Link is a full shaped and sized Toon Link. This did work because they weren't strict top down, but for every 3d Zelda game, link has been true to the game art as to proportion.

So what about this Link? For some reason it bugs me that if he is shown in the game art as the same proportions as old Zelda illustrations, that his 3d Model is not. When Link is propelled up into the air, we see more than the top of his chubby self, and can see he is quite cherubic.

What about cutscenes? Personally I'm hoping they stick to top down, text cutscenes, because anything that had a small baby link in it, would be hard to be taken seriously, especially if we saw official game art of him looking properly proportioned or badass.

Now if the Game art does look like this baby-link, then I doubt I'll be able to take the game seriously at all. This may change when playing it, but that's my concern at the moment.

My group of friends and I aren't sure, we separate into both categories. Some argue that a film would look horribly cheesy like Dragonball Evolution, or that OoT film made in america that was screened in cinema's till Nintendo found out. The other side feel that if given the right direction, it could be made quite well. I am on the fence to be brutally honest, part of me would squeal just like I did when I found out about DBZ Evo. But then that excitement died with the trailer of the film, which I fear would happen with LoZ.

Anyway here are some of the things we as a group listed; I've organised them in order of hell yes to hell no!

**Hell Yes**

* Ezlo as Link's guide. Seriously Navi would make the film suffer. Ezlo is a far more animated character who can bring a lot more to the table than the ""Hey Listen' joke.

* Semi-serious tone, having a mega gritty and dark would basically be bad since the series is known for being lighthearted whilst at the same time as being sinister in it's own way. I feel the film would benefit from not going down a too gritty road.

* New storyline, yes whilst OoT is a brilliant game or so is TP, to be honest a new storyline I think would be far more interesting, it would open up the film to the public which in turn means that in order to please both the fans and general public the use of zelda quotes etc would have to be well thought out.

* Wardrobe revamp, yes the costumes and such are great, but whenever I have seen them used in fan films, it literally makes me want to avert my eyes. The costumes for the games work perfectly, but in regards to film they always look out of place. For example that Sonic the hedgehog fan film that came out recently. It was good for a fan film, but Eggman's costume, dear god was it horribly designed. Personally if your taking anything from a game to film, you need to change the attire so that it can fit something that the general public would be comfortable seeing fashionably.  

**Ehh Maybe?**

* Link talking, now I know its blasphemy to say such a thing, however, if we are talking about live action film, having a completely mute character isn't an easy person to cast. You have to be able to find someone who is particularly good at being animated with their body language and facial expression, which isn't that easy. Now I'm not saying have Link be a chatterbox, but talking a bit might be good? 

**Hell no**

* Ganondorf being actually green. If done right it could look good, but personally I think it would look odd. A dark grey perhaps, or not being racist, being black (due to being brought up in a desert like environment (yes I know not everyone is dark skinned when raised in such a place)) Would work better. The red hair would have to become a deeper magenta in order to look better.

* 'Excuse me Princess!' if Link talks he can't say that line, yes it could be used as a perfect gag joke, but think about the film trailer, IT WOULD BE SHOWN AS THE TRAILER JOKE NONSTOP. What starts out as a hilarious quip quickly becomes a shut the hell up.

* Being directed by James Cameron
* Or Christopher Nolan, imagine that 'Zelda Begins'...

These are just a couple we thought about, the last two ended up taking over the conversation for some hilarious moments. Anyway so, what would you guys like to see if one existed, or what wouldn't you!

EDIT: I'm loving the comments, I thought this was going to get brushed aside! Just saying I am challenging people's thoughts because I can't stop thinking about the idea since me and my friends talked about it. Whilst I wouldn't have to skill or money to make anything, I might write something up so I'm curious to see people's thoughts and stuff before I decide if I want to commit to a new evening activity! I think I'll also post this on /r/zelda to see what they think over there!

I've been trying to rationalize in my head a way to make it concurrently canon with the other two timeline splits, and I feel like I have one, which would work perfectly if it weren't for one detail in Hyrule Historia. :(

My theory is as follows: When Link pulls out the Master Sword, we know he's ""sealed away"" for seven years before reawakening as someone old enough to be the Hero of Time.

But during those seven years, what's going on? Obviously Link is aging, but is the Sacred Realm where he's being sealed within the same ""stream"" of time as Hyrule? Perhaps from the perspective of Hyrule, Link is removed from time during those seven years. That would mean there are three timeline splits.

1) Link is removed from the timeline, meaning Ganon succeeds in his endeavors (the downfall timeline).

2) Link reawakens and returns to Hyrule's timeline seven years in Hyrule's future, creating a timeline split from (1) where the world, once again, has Link in it. He proceeds to do what he does in the game and defeats Ganon, before disappearing into the past, and no longer existing in that timeline (the adult timeline).

3) When Link returns to the past, he warns Zelda and changes the course of the future, creating a timeline split from (2) (the child timeline).

I think this would work quite well as a way to explain the three timelines existing concurrently, except for one thing: Hyrule Historia specifically states that Link's death in the downfall timeline occurs during the final battle with Ganon. This completely shatters my theory and really leaves no wiggle room for any others. It's a real shame Nintendo didn't go for an explanation like this, because I think it would work a lot better than the essential cop out they came up with.

So what do you guys think? I'm sure my theory has quite a few holes due to details and trivia I totally forgot about.

**New Legends**

When Nintendo started working on the next Legend of Zelda game they had only one rule: nothing is holy.
Level has as world first witnessed what the future holds for Nintendo's legendary franchise.
Hope you're all with us.

**_______________________________________________________**

**The Legend of Zelda: Hyrule**

I stand on a mountaintop and look out over Hyrule. On the horizon I see the royal castle. West of the castle I see a vast desert. High above the land float the smoke and ash spit out of Death Mountain. It's close to erupting.

I search my pocket for the compass. The item that previously had a pretty much useless function has become my best friend. I wouldn't survive a day without it in this enormous unforgiving world.

Hyrule is the game where Nintendo literally lets us explain every single corner of the Legend of Zelda universe. Despite the series always having placed the player in a fascinating world, it has been impossible to avoid the feeling of limitation. The dream of exploring past the mountains, above the clouds, or behind the invisible walls has always been there.

The new game displays the classic world on a completely new scale. All of the series' most iconic places and environments are still there, and areas like the Lost Woods and Lake Hylia have transformed and expanded, resulting in regions bigger than and with more content than all of Ocarina of Time.

Hyrule takes place in a kingdom divided by the political interests of the different tribes and races. Humans accuse the Hylians, the people chosen by the gods, to have come up with their divine blood-line. The fight against the monsters of the Lost Woods has left the Kokiri tribe on the brink of destruction. The poisonous ash from Death Mountain has forced the gorons out of their home, and in their search for a new place to call home risks turning into an all-out war between them and the zora.

Within the walls of the castle whispers are heard. Whispers of a boy with green clothes and the symbol of the Triforce on the back of his hand. He drove evil back thousands of years ago. Prophecies say the time has come for a new hero to unite Hyrule and save the kingdom from ruin. But so far no hero has emerged.

That is because you are the hero.

The key word in The Legend of Zelda: Hyrule is freedom. You take on the role as a reincarnated Link. You are not only free to play however you want, but as whoever you want. In the character editor you can choose to play as a strong goron, an agile zora or a thieving gerudo. According to rumors one will even be able to play as a shiekah or a rito, the bird race from The Wind Waker. But be prepared for your choice of race to affect your story-line as well as how other characters relate to you.

New for the game is also the freedom of taking the dungeons on in any order you desire. From Hyrule's mountaintops you can spot all nine of them, spread out across all the regions of the land. Monstrous creatures swim, crawl or soar above these structures. They are the bosses of the dungeons, guarding their treasures, and their roars can be heard miles away.

Skeptics usually criticize the recycling of puzzles in The Legend of Zelda, but the dungeons in Hyrule don't follow the formula of previous titles. To reach the top of a dungeon you will still need to solve a number of puzzles, but these are no longer restrained to a single solution and can be solved in many multiple ways. If you played as an agile character you could pass a number of traps without setting them off. If you instead played as a character with magical powers you could conjure items or creatures to help you progress.

Although you are free to act on your own, it's important to remember that your actions will have consequences for Hyrule and its people. The game has a dynamic ecosystem where everything affects something else. If you change this balance it will affect the environment. If you manage to stop Death Mountain from erupting and suppress the lava you remove Lake Hylia's source of heat, resulting in it freezing over. If Lake Hylia freezes over that lowers the temperature in Zora's river, which has always been an incredibly important source of water for all of Hyrule.

And regarding the smaller consequences, let us say this: people will no longer be okay with some stranger walking into their house and breaking all their pots.

**_______________________________________________________**

**The New Legend of Zelda**

""Help me.. Please help me.. I am a prisoner in the dungeon of the castle. My name is Zelda.""

Link wakes up. Or he's still dreaming. The only thing he knows for sure is that the voice in his head desperately is pleading for help.

""The wizard, Agahnim, has done.. something to the other missing girls. Now only I remain. Agahnim has seized control of the wise men's seal.""

A heavy, dark rain falls outside of the warm, safe house.

""I am in the dungeon of the castle. Please help me..""

Link himself doesn't know whether it's because he wants answers or because he wants to help, but he gets out of his bed, gets his lantern and steps out into the cold, black night.

This is one of the most well-known introduction of gaming history, only this time, it functions as epilogue.

The New Legend of Zelda tells nothing about how the stormy night ends, it tells the story that led up to it.

How did Agahnim seize power in Hyrule? Who is the uncle Link lives with? How was the flute boy's life before being twisted by the powers of the Dark World? All of these questions are answered in The New Legend of Zelda, the lovely pixel adventure that takes us back to a time before complex control-schemes, before 3D-graphics, before A Link to the Past.

Nintendo has used everything they learnt from New Super Mario Bros to bit by bit, piece by piece, rebuild the two-dimensional, though never shallow, Hyrule Link once grew up in. The graphics engine is a revamped HD version of Four Swords Adventures, which allows for an enormous amount of detail but still the ability to zoom out in order to get a better overview of the promised land.

Just like what Zelda II: the Adventure of Link did to the world of the original Legend of Zelda, The New Legend of Zelda expands the world from A Link to the Past northward. We finally get to explore past Death Mountain, find new exits out of the Lost Woods and reach as far away from the southern desert as one possibly could. Anyone wondering what lies beneath the clouds north of the Tower of Hera will finally have their fantasies fulfilled. This is a story about the dreams of our childhoods.

Another important point to make is that the story never gets more space than what can be told in a handful of text-boxes each containing three lines of text. The reason that the story of say Link's Awakening is so captivating is as simple as it is obvious: it has a basic idea so ingenious you barely have to mention it.

The New Legend of Zelda is a return to the old ways of game design in the same way. The series used to be pretty much an interactive puzzle-book played mainly for problem-solving, where you had to use your smarts even to defeat your enemies. The Legend of Zelda never had as much in common with action-adventure games and RPGs as it had with Tetris and Myst, where you always had to solve smaller problems with a greater threat looming at the horizon.

Just like New Super Mario Bros, The New Legend of Zelda is a search for the series roots, or rather the core that the roots sprouted from. This means that The New Legend of Zelda won't use most of the Wii U's features, like the controller's built in camera, accelerometer, microphone and gyroscope. Nor is it compatible with the balance board and the right analog stick does absolutely nothing. The only thing shown on the controller's screen is a simple inventory and a map.

Surprisingly though is the presence of online aspects, in ways reminiscent of Sahasrahla's magical stone plates from A Link to the Past. The player will be able to leave clues for other players on these magical stone plates via Miiverse in the New Legend of Zelda, much like in Demon's Souls.

Today The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past is one of the best games ever made. Maybe the only way to surpass the old masterpiece is to return to a time before it existed.

**_______________________________________________________**

The third idea they had was a game where you play as ganondorf. It would be heavily story-driven and very dark.

The last was basically the first Legend of Zelda turned into co-op with the second player taking on the role of Princess Zelda.

Zelda is a love interest in Skyward Sword, Zelda 1 and Zelda 2 (i think?) and somewhat of a love interest in OoT and WW (though not really). She is friendly in TP, and she is his sister in ALTtP and Link's Awakening. I don't remember zelda being in either Oracle game.

EDIT: I looked at the timeline again and not all of these match-up i.e. she is a sister and then a love interest in the same time-stream sometimes (ex: ALttP is ahead of Zelda 1 and 2 in the same time stream).

Everybody's different, so I'd love to see a discussion between both sides of the spectrum go on. Let's converse!

Personally, I always thought it was a bit forced and unneeded to add a timeline theory to the series. Sure, it's great that Nintendo is trying to put these games together, but similar to the Metroid series, the Zelda series has never *needed* to be strung together. It would make much more sense if Nintendo had originally planned out a series, like how Konami planned there to be multiple Metal Gear Solid games. I don't see why they couldn't have just left each game to be separate, just look at how successful Square was with their Final Fantasy games! And none of them are pieced together in some saga-like fashion; each of the games are their own epic masterpiece. But that being said, the timeline theory does add a lot of interesting continuity between games. I absolutely love how Wind Waker ties in from Ocarina of Time, I found that to be BRILLIANTLY executed.

I am excluding MM from this discussion because if you came over from /r/zelda, you are aware immense fandom for the game. we already KNOW why people like the game. It's dark. It has complex themes. Sure. It's a great game, but it has been discussed to death and it's the same reasons every time. Unless there are some really good overlooked points that can be made about the game, we don't really need to discuss it any further.

My favourite Zelda game is Oracle of Seasons. I believe it is one of the best games for the Gameboy Colour system. It has a level of depth that you don't often get with portable games of that era. It seamlessly combines a puzzle mechanic (season changing) with a memorable adventure full of excellent characters, places to explore, and obstacles to overcome.

 A problem I have with many Zelda games is the fact that the games are mostly set in Hyrule. Even though the land changes quite drastically, it's still the same basic format. Mountain, Lake, Desert, Forest, you know. All of the Gameboy games took link out of Hyrule and into brand new lands, giving way for more creative landscapes. I liked Holodrum the most of all. When I played the game when I was younger, Subrosia, the subterranean land under Holodrum, always sparked my imagination. I really wish Nintendo would explore the race of Subrosians in a little more depth, because I feel that they are interesting characters which get less credit than they are due.

The seasons puzzle element was excellent. Each season gave you new ways to progress and manipulate the world around you and move forward. You had a strong desire to acquire the seasons because you know that they are going to help you along with your journey. It was a crucial collectible that paid off; something which is rare in adventure games, I believe. In games like OoT and MM, you get the crucial collectibles (medallions, sacred jewels, boss masks) because you need them, but they don't do squat for you until you reach certain checkpoints. The seasons were more than a simple ""key to the final boss"". They were useful abilities prominent over the entire duration of the game. 

For a Gameboy Colour game, it looked fantastic. The seasons had their own colour pallet which really made the game stand out for me. It looked even better on Gameboy Advance, which was really cool considering the Gameboy Advance had been out by the time OoS and OoA came out. 

I could rave on about this game even more, but these are the main things which made OoS stand out for me.

---

So I just got the Hyrule Historia today, my own copy and in English. I bring this up because for quite a while the timeline we have had from it had been based off a fan translation so when they said that the 3rd timeline was ""Link is defeated"" I thought ""that doesn't make sense, surely they mistranslated and it actually says Link doesn't defeat Ganon"".

Though when I looked at the relevant part in my English copy it was as they said.

---

**Of all possible outcomes, Link, the Hero of Time, faced defeat at the hands of Ganondorf. The thief obtained the three pieces of the Triforce, transformed into the Demon King, Ganon, and continued to threaten the world in future eras.**

...

***The Hero of Time's Defeat***

**Ganondorf the thief obtained the Triforce of Power and managed to get his hands on Princess Zelda. The Hero of Time, Link, challenged him in a battle that would determine Hyrule's very existence, and lost.**

---

The whole problem with this is that if Link is defeated then it is not possible for the timeline to split afterwards because the splits were caused by him heading back in time and changing the past. Nowhere in the game do we see an event like this either.

[I made this image a while ago to explain what the 3rd split actually was](http://i.imgur.com/NRWrE03.png), back when I thought that it was a mistranslation. As you can see, the splits are caused when Link goes back in time and since Link goes back in time during the spirit temple, he leaves behind Hyrule to the mercy of Ganon, failing to defeat him. This is something that can clearly happen in the game rather than a ""what if"".

The only possible way for this to work is if Link survived the defeat, went back in time and fought Ganondorf again without the power of the Triforce yet somehow winning despite being weaker. This is quite ridiculous though and isn't backed up anywhere in the game. We follow Link from start to finish and we never see Link defeated by Ganondorf. If Link is somehow split and we follow the Link that wins then that raises the question, who went back in time and changed things so Link would win?",,False,,t5_2tfzp,1360616613.0,,,True,t3_17dphk,http://www.reddit.com/r/truezelda/comments/17dphk/the_problem_with_3rd_timeline_being_link_is/,

It’s a great community that is going strong, and I love the live streamers who chat with you while they’re practicing – very helpful!

But here’s my main idea: What if the next Zelda game incorporated those same glitches purposefully, so that more advanced Zelda players could explore the world out of order and move through it at completely unique paces. The main glitches I’m talking about are:

[Mega Flip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGPL961Qtc8)
[Super Slide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplPJR7XDnw)
[Hover Slide](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4BUyBosTrk&amp;feature=player_embedded)
[Ground Jump](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=kjWNTuun-tM)
[Bomb Hover](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQW2zxCx90g&amp;feature=player_embedded)

Of course, this is assuming things like the hover boots or Naryu’s Love exist or there are similarly functioning items. Most of these glitches require amazing timing and practice, so new players won’t accidentally fall upon them and have their preliminary experience ruined. And in my experience, it’s hugely rewarding to Mega Flip after practicing with 50-60 bombs. 

**tl;dr** what if game developers purposefully added glitches from OoT/MM into the next Zelda franchise to encourage a new type of exploration?

It was always focused on the adventure, and that being pretty much the meat of the game. 

It was always the story of a hero who had to go through a series of trials to achieve his main goal of saving the Princess, and the land of Hyrule, from evil. 

My question is, how could a Zelda game work if the game was more focused on a ""true story"".  In the past, Link never had much more motivation for doing what he does than it was his destiny. For example, I saw a post on this subreddit about Link's mother, or who she is. What if, say, the game starts off with his mother being killed (sorry, I wouldn't like the idea of her being kidnapped. I don't want a rescue mission.) by Ganon, or the main antagonist of the game, if they decide to leave him out. So there's his motivation, and I think it would make the character of Link more relatable, without ruining the whole basis of his character. It would give him an actual personality, besides the strong, brave hero he's always been. 

I'd like to mention that the adventure-based Zelda we all know isn't really a bad thing, it's always made Zelda feel like more of an experience than a game, although the gameplay is always solid.

My theory is based on Link being asleep.

I don't really like the idea of Termina being a parallel universe along side of the Hyrule universe. Most of the theories I've read about that are usually drawing a blank in most areas. It's also highly unlikely seeing as how Romani and Creamia are both 'counterparts' of Malon from Hyrule. How can there be two counterparts for the same person? What I do believe is that the entirety of Termina is all in Link's mind. I'm aware there are other theories similar to this one, but it makes sense for what I'm about to say. Every character in MM is someone that Link has seen before in his past, not necessarily in just OoT. People that we don't recognize from OoT like Kafei or the mayor are just people that LINK has seen before, but not US.

To explain why Link in his dreamstate, I believe that he wasn't entirely pure of heart when he was returned to his own timeline. He was always isolated from everyone else because he was raised by people he was not related to and he was fighting battles for people he'd never known before with absolutely nothing to show for it. Perhaps while he was pondering his own experiences during the time between when he was sent back to his own timeline and the beginning of MM, he felt a sense of distrust and malcontent towards the people he'd worked so hard to help. The HMS was 'following' Link while he was on his journey and in the very beginning of the game, Link appears to be exhausted and worn out. I believe that the HMS put him into a deep dreamlike state at that point and everything from then on is an internal conflict with his own flaws. 

Majora is all of Link's negative thoughts and emotions while everyone else is a small burden that Link has to overcome. Every person he helps is a representation of what Link did for everyone in Hyrule. He saves everyone, but no one knows him and he becomes a nameless hero. They all seem grateful at first, but as time goes on, or back in this case, Link will have to perform the same trivial tasks time and time again... or not. Link realizes that all of the people he's helping have no clue as to who he his or what he's done for them and while he's gallivanting around Termina, his lack of purity begins to grow. 

The Fierce Deity IS Link's physical representation of his rage and hatred towards the people he's helped who have so carelessly forgotten him. You obviously only get this mask after having collected all the other masks which means you've helped a lot of people with their own problems. The idea of the FD mask is that all that help was entirely futile and that is what throws Link over the edge and he loses control of himself in a blind rage.

The idea behind defeating Majora is Link conquering himself and getting rid of his negative thoughts and feelings. The more people he helps, the easier it becomes to defeat Majora. When Link helps enough people, he gets the FD mask which makes it far easier to defeat Majora. I think that while Link in his state of blind rage, it suddenly becomes so clear to him what his flaws are and what he needs to do to be rid of them which is what makes it so easy for him to defeat Majora.

So, my theory is that Link is in a 'coma' induced by the HMS as a challenge to overcome his own flaws and become pure of heart like the legends says he is.

Why the hell is there an amber gem instead of sapphire?! During the first play through of SS, I was initially confused when I received the amber tablet and saw the yellow light leading to Lanayru. During the second play through, it only made me angry! Faron = forest, Farore, courage, and wind = Emerald. Eldin = fire, Din, and power = Ruby. Lanayru = love, Nayru, and wisdom ≠ amber! Sapphire and the color blue has always represented Nayru in LoZ! Even if the amber is supposed to be indicative of Lanayru's desert, the desert was an ocean when the goddesses created Hyrule. Also, Nayru's Love (a blue-colored stone which produces a blue barrier around Link) is found in the Desert Colossus in OoT. In fact, the Goddess of Sand is often thought to be Nayru. And Nayru likes blue, not yellow dammit! WHY?!

Edit: After researching this topic a bit more, I realized that the Thunder Dragon (Lanayru) has the Mark of Nayru on his robes. This mark is the exact same design as the Zora Sapphire, but is orange instead of blue. Zelda wiki states that Nayru is often associated with water and is worshiped as the Goddess of the Seas. Perhaps, she was formerly associated with electricity and thunder (represented by an orange color) until the death of the Thunder Dragon and extinction of the ancient robots. Afterwards, perhaps she dedicated herself to the seas and Zoras while Farore dealt with the forest creatures.

As far as preferences go: I'm hoping to get the harder of the two games. I'm not a huge fan of sidequests, in OoT, they were minimal and fun so that was fine, but I don't want to have to go to 3 dungeons, a forest, a volcano, back to a dungeon, and lastly to a house just to get an empty jar. I'm not a huge fan of handholding (If I need help I'll look online). Lastly, the controls should be decent, OoT had them almost perfect. I shouldn't have to struggle to look a certain way.

Which of these two should I get? Also, would Wind Waker work on a Wii?

Now, I think it's really cool that Nintendo did that. Making a song sound great both forwards and backwards is amazing. However, now there is a problem. In terms of Hyrulian history, the Ballad of the Goddess came first, as seen in Skyward Sword. But suddenly, in the Ocarina of Time we have the song in reverse, and it is instead called Zelda's Lullaby. Explanation on how that switch came to be over the course of Hyrulian history is nowhere to be found.

Any technology sufficiently advanced so as not to be understood is indistinguishable from magic.

1358120143.0,3,self.truezelda,16imvu,I want to talk about plot in the Zelda series and how we as a collective fanbase take it too seriously.,15,12,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/truezelda/comments/16imvu/i_want_to_talk_about_plot_in_the_zelda_series_and/,"I have noticed that we, the Zelda fans love making up theories regarding things such as stone tower, the fierce deity's mask, the hat, timeline, dead hero branch, hero's shade, great flood, and so on.

But I always like to see a Zelda game as something separate and have come to understand that the series has never truly been about the plot. It's nice and serviceable but it's not a Bethesda, BioWare, Valve or Irrational plot. 

Instead it's a vessel for the game to take place.

Take Majora's Mask for instance. There's a lot of crazy theories (the stone tower temple being my favorite one) but things such as the parallel universe statement (which if I recall correctly is on the instruction booklet) are oftentimes taken too seriously when the game has the ""same"" characters due to the development which took 18 months.

Or about the timelines. I am certain Nintendo didn't start thinking of a connection between the games up until Ocarina of Time but they screwed up and had to do the whole split timeline thing because when developing the games, they always think of the gameplay, dungeons, mechanics and the like before even thinking about a plot. Majora's Mask and Wind Waker are a prime example of this. They couldn't fit properly so it's only natural that they do the whole split timeline thing. Same thing with the classics. 

But when talking about the classics, and seeing how most posts, theories, screenshots on /r/zelda and others are often from the 3D games, I wonder why do most of us seem to enjoy the 3D games more.  Is it because of the ""dated"" controls? The graphics? Or is it because the connection between those games and the 3D ones is kind of blurry despite the now official timeline.

I think we do since the plot sometimes drives us towards completing the game and enjoying them more, but I've been playing Dark and Demon's Souls lately and wonder if we should stop thinking too much into Nintendo's writing skills. I for one think so. I don't say that we should have a plotless Zelda, but I've noticed that in the past two 3D installments, the plot gets in the way of the game a bit far too often. The first 2-3 hours are a tutorial and for a 25 year old franchise, those things should be skippable, but they cannot since the the beginning of the plot is the tutorial.

I know this is a long post and it's got quite a bit of questions/comments, but I've been thinking about this for a while so anyone who agrees/disagrees with me, why or why not?",,False,,t5_2tfzp,False,,,True,t3_16imvu,http://www.reddit.com/r/truezelda/comments/16imvu/i_want_to_talk_about_plot_in_the_zelda_series_and/,

The only thing I didn't enjoy about Zelda was the lack of replayability. I know I might be comparing a Zelda game to a game with an RPG element, but I can't help to feel a little sad once I defeat the main boss: ""What's left to do besides collecting heart pieces and perfecting the game?""

Skyward Sword seemed to up the replay value of the game by adding Hero Mode and Goddess Cubes to quench your treasure hunting spirit. But after all of that, what else can you do? Speed Runs? 3-Heart Challenge? I've done plenty of other methods to keep Zelda games fun, but I have an alternative solution that could possibly make Zelda games more fun:

Nintendo could put a new currency in the game similar to Tales of Symphonia's Grade (it measures how well you do in battle and gives you points to spend on a NEW game). Attributes to this NEW game contain examples such as gain 10x xp per battle, 1/2x xp per battle (for a challenge) or keeping all of your items and collectables in the next playthrough. That concept kept me playing ToS for 200+ hours on a 40-50 Hour playthrough each. This was because the ceiling for the amount of content you can unlock was very high. Some of the high-rewarding attributes you could spend your points on cost a lot of Grade, which disallowed you to get everything after the first playthrough.

This currency can come from Monster Drops or Secret Treasure Chests, or even scripted events like the gratitude crystals for SS. At the end of the game you are given the option to make a new game+ and when you begin the game, you can spend your points on things that alter the outcome of the gameplay, such as enemies do 2x,3x or 1/2x damage; Double rupees or half rupees; You do 1/2 or 2x damage. These sound very undesirable, but again, I think it is difficult to add an element of RPG to a Zelda Game.

I'm not sure what Nintendo can do because what I'm suggesting is a very RPG heavy element. But it would be nice to have that feeling of wanting to create a new game after the quest is finished rather than beating it, then picking it up again 3 years later after having a nostalgia attack...much like what I do with OoT and MM.",,False,,t5_2tfzp,1349901072.0,,,True,t3_119qxb,http://www.reddit.com/r/truezelda/comments/119qxb/replayability_in_zelda_games/,

His ""deaths"" range from falling into lava, to dying in a fight against the final boss of the game. My question is: what happens when Link dies?

We've already seen one official timeline created because of Link's failure. Is it safe to assume there's a timeline created every time Link falls into lava, and another set of timelines for every time Cucco's attacked Link?

If not, what do you think happens when Link dies? Maybe the goddesses give him another chance and put him back at the start (kinda like Gandalf The White in LOTR)? Or perhaps he falls unconscious and wakes up at a later point? Another idea to consider is that he never dies at all, and that when we see him 'die' we're seeing a visual representation of Link's godly premonitions.

In fact, I think I'd go apeshit if there was an official Hylian language and it would be the perfect solution. It gives the characters a global voice and nerds would have something to nerd hard about.

But what happens to the happy mask salesman in the adult time line? He seems to be no where to be found as an adult so I have a theory that when Ganon comes to power, I think he turned him into a redead like everyone else in the town. So if the happy mask salesman is technically dead, he could have never found the mask to have skull kid steal it. So that means that Majora's Mask could still be waiting for someone to find it in its rest place in the adult time line.

One of the things I like about A Link to the Past is it's higher difficulty in dealing with enemies. There's a lot that a new Zelda entry could stand to gain from emulating A Link to the Past. However, there are certain parts of the game's difficulty that I don't think have aged well. The parts that I'm talking about aren't even the hardest parts of the game (I've enjoyed parts of ALttP that were harder than the parts I'm complaining about), they are just the most annoying to me. The reason I play Zelda games is to have an adventure which involves exploring, finding out how to beat enemies, and solving puzzles. What I mean by unnecessary difficulty is game elements that are difficult just for the sake of difficulty and take away from the reason you play that specific game. Here's my take on a few parts of ALttP that annoyed me because they were difficult in a way that took away from the adventure aspect of Zelda.

What is your opinion of these specific things in the game? Also, what other parts of other Zelda games have you thought were difficult in a way that detracted from the ""spirit"" of a Zelda game.

**Moldorm**

&gt;He is hard to avoid and knocks you off a cliff forcing you to backtrack through a room or two and face him again at full health. Being forced to backtrack after being hit only once is not my idea of adventure. If I have to backtrack I'd rather it be because I forgot something I knew that I needed or I'm searching more closely for treasure. Repeating a boss fight after only being hit once is not my idea of adventure. I'd rather fight a boss twice as hard as Moldorm (who wouldn't be that hard in a ""fair"" fight) than deal with cheap moves that cause boring repetition.

**Wallmasters**

&gt;They punish you for being inattentive (as you probably know you can tell they're coming from your shadow). I have no problem with that. They also take you back to where you most recently entered the temple. Again, forced backtracking isn't my idea of a fun adventure. I'd rather they hurt you when they grabbed you, then either left or jumped off you to fight you some more. This way you're still punished for being inattentive but you don't have to backtrack.

**The falling rocks on Death Mountain**

&gt;I have no idea how to dodge these. They generally move down the mountain but often they move randomly to the side. If I'm missing some sort of way the rocks indicate their movement then just ignore this bulletpoint. If they do not give any sign of when they will move sideways then in my book it makes them a badly designed enemy. A good enemy to me is one that has a limited number of attacks. You may not know which attack they'll use but you know the possibilities and you can learn to deal with them better. A good enemy rewards learning and punishes a lack of learning. A random, invincible, unstoppable enemy, especially one that is hard to avoid, randomly punishes you and you don't really learn anything. You just learn to expect you will take a random amount of damage when you walk through Death Mountain.

**Enemies and bombs hiding in the grass**

&gt;(Please ignore this bulletpoint if there is some visual or audio clue that there is an enemy or bomb in the grass, I haven't played long enough to figure it out) The bee is fine in my book. It doesn't hurt you much and can be used as a tool if caught. Every other asshole or bomb hiding in the grass is an example of bad game design. In a game that wants to encourage exploration, why would you randomly punish exploration? If the grass was a different color or moved you could learn to avoid it while exploring. As far as I can tell that is not the case.",,False,,t5_2tfzp,1361164904.0,,,True,t3_18qgdv,http://www.reddit.com/r/truezelda/comments/18qgdv/unnecessary_difficulty_in_a_link_to_the_past/,

Termina is a mirror world to Hyrule. He sees Malon as a child, Romani, and as adult, Cremia.
These two reflect Malon's personalitys.

The folk of clocktown think that Kafei ran off with Cremia, like when Malon dreamed of a knight in shining armor sweeping her off of her feet.

My partner in crime. My candle in the dark. My shining hope.
You have saved Hyrule and countless other lands.  You have stopped demons, evil gods, and massive creatures alike.  Battling through water, fire, earth, and even time.  Your courage only matched by the bravery of whichever sidekick is helping you along the way.  You've done so much for everyone and nothing for yourself. Sometimes I still catch myself, if only for a moment back in the mind set of my 8 year old self. Some of our best battles weren't played on a system.  They were imagined.  The hours I spent just roaming the country side with you, even after completing our quest.  Only you are such a good friend that even after we have had every adventure that there is to be taken, we still find eachother spending time, doing absolutely nothing.  Shooting arrows at trees, making up our own adventures in Hyrule.  Your a damn good friend. 

I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart container.  You gave me the tools I am most proud of in life.  All of my admirable traits come straight from you.  My intellect: Your puzzles and dungeons are beatable no matter how hard they may seem.  You keep pressing forward finding the most logical next step.  You take things slow, you look at the fine details.  My sense of humor:  You still show that even in our darkest hours that there is still life to be had.  My bravery: I never am afraid of being who I am. Embracing my destiny.  Fixing injustices where ever they turn their ugly head.  My **PATIENCE**: Probably the most important lesson you taught me.  If I want too accomplish something great, then I need too wait.  You never go faster than need be.  From the most complicated puzzle to the skinniest rope to cross, you gave me the patience needed to know something worth doing is worth doing right.

You are one of my best friends.  You give me a coda to live by.  I can only hope to be more like you with every passing day.  I owe you more than the price of your games, more than my life, I owe you who I am.  You've helped me to grow into who I am today and for that I owe it to you to be that man to the best of my ability.  

When I hear those first several notes it doesn't just bring me back to my childhood, it reminds me of who I really am.
Thanks Link, you've done more for me than I could ask of anyone.
Sincerely,
Your bestfriend",,False,,t5_2tfzp,False,,,True,t3_1gw2r7,http://www.reddit.com/r/truezelda/comments/1gw2r7/dear_link/,

I want to see some scary looking foes.  Sure Nintendo prides itself on the ""cartoony"" nature of it's classic characters, but in my opinion if they put out a Zelda game with very realistic graphics, kept the classic puzzle style of the game along with the free-roaming ability.  Have a matured Link, maybe have it be say 10 years after the Majora's Mask storyline and Link roams back to Hyrule to discover a new evil has ARISEN?! Then at the end of the game end it with a quick shot of a Ganon like figure.  That way we could have a direct sequel to a Zelda game?  Be a nice first I'd say.  What do you all think? Any ideas on new things they might bring into play? Will Epona be back? Will Link venture to a new area eh?

	I sat in complete silence. The sand beneath me was warm and my feet were placed in the shallow water before me. There was a small waterfall in the distance, and my uncle, Russell, was sitting next to me, enjoying the peace that surrounded us. We were in Faron Woods, the forest just north of my village, taking a short break like we always do. We were heading back to the village after heading out to get some firewood, but the peace of the Spring brought us to a stop. The forest was the most beautiful at this time, with the setting sun shining its golden light through the leaves of the trees. In this forest, the air is never too hot or too cold in the shade of the trees and there was an occasional breeze every once in a while. It truly was a wonderful place, and I liked to believe that it represented me. At least… when I’m calm inside…
	With a sigh, I looked up, my dirty blonde hair gently moving away from my eyes so I could see the darkening sky through the trees. It was getting late; so I should head back home…
	Home…No… that won’t ever exist again…
	I sighed again, shifting my attention back to the water and gazing at my reflection. I hated to look at myself, knowing that I’d see the too-familiar sadness that clouds my sky blue eyes. But sometimes, I like to remember that I’m a lot stronger than I was before… that night 8 years ago… when I lost everything…. 
	I tore my eyes away from that damned reflection, desperately forcing myself not to fall apart. Please Russell; I need you to say something to distract me from this. Say something… ANYTHING!
	“Tell me…do you ever feel a strange sadness as dusk falls?” He finally said, silencing the tirade that was running through my head.
	Silently thanking him for giving me something else to ponder, I thought about what he asked me. It seems like I only feel this way when the sun sets. Almost as if the fading light wakes the deepest emotions I hide inside me. All those emotions: sadness, helplessness, anger, self-doubt, that have been sealed inside me ever since that night seem to get to me the easiest during this time… as if I’m vulnerable to my own weaknesses in the light of the setting sun. I turned to him. “Yeah…but you know that I nearly always feel this way.”
	He nodded, not even daring to look at me. “Yeah…I know. I’m sorry; I shouldn’t bring something like that back into your mind.”
	I shook my head dismissively, turning my gaze back to the spring. “Don’t worry about it; it’s fine. I mean, I was already thinking about it anyways.” I muttered. “But, on a different note…” I said, clearing my throat. “Did you ever talk to the mayor about delivering the gifts to the royal family?”
	He chuckled. “Yeah. But it seems he wants to ask you about doing it. He said that he feels it as the right thing to do to give you the opportunity to explore the land of Hyrule, just like your brother has done.” He looked at me, and I returned his gaze. “Do you think you could take over this honor in my place, Link?”
	Remembering my brother and what he used to do brought a pang to my heart and I instantly thought of something to say to take him away from that idea. Staring at him with my mouth a gape, I violently shook my head. “What?! I can’t do that! I can hardly ride Epona for a short distance without falling off, let alone traveling across the Kingdom!” 
	He laughed, putting his hand on my head and messing up my hair. I hate it when he does that…I’m not a little kid; I’m almost 18. “I’ve seen you ride her at a full gallop before. You’ve even jumped a fence without a flaw, so don’t try that excuse on me. C’mon, the mayor wouldn’t even mention your name if he knew you weren’t up for it.”
	Well then, I guess trying to cover my horseback skills didn’t work out very well. I sighed. “Yeah…I know. Sorry. It’s just that… I don’t want to live in the memory of my brother by doing everything he used to do. I’m nothing like him, and I really don’t want to become like him. It’s too painful just to wake up knowing that he isn’t alive anymore.”
	Before he could say anything in response, I stood up and walked towards Epona, my Clydesdale. She was a magnificent horse with a tan coat and a white, flowing mane. She was a horse breed that was meant to do a lot of heavy duty work, but that didn’t change the fact that she looked uncomfortable with all that firewood loaded on top of her back. “It’s getting late; we should start heading back.” I took ahold of her reins and looked her over, chuckling a little at how she was shifting her weight from side to side. “Plus, Epona looks like she’s about to collapse.”
	Russell got to his feet with a short laugh. “Alright, then let’s go back.” He walked towards me and scoffed. “And Link, don’t get yourself all worked up. Just because you aren’t your brother doesn’t mean you can’t have an adventure on your own. Hyrule is a huge land full of beautiful things and you should be given the chance to see it all with your own eyes.”
	I scoffed. “That’s easy for you to say. Sure, I’ll admit that I can go and do all of that on my own. But I won’t have fun with it. You know what’s been taken from me. You know exactly what I’ve gone through. The last thing I need is another opportunity to experience a painful reminder in the form of a too-damn-good memory.” I tugged lightly on the reins and began leading Epona down the dirt path that would eventually lead us back to our village. Russell silently trailed right beside me, looking strangely like a little kid even though he’s somewhere in his thirties.
	The silence was soothing, and I was starting to appreciate the familiar sounds of Epona’s horseshoes clapping against the ground when Russell shattered the silence. “Regardless of what you think, Link, I believe that everyone deserves a little adventure, even if it gets you into trouble.” He muttered. “That’s the only way you learn.”
	I was about to say something witty and sarcastic, just because I wanted him to forget it. But, before I could open my mouth, I realized what he was saying. We don’t learn anything until we experience it ourselves. We can’t just go by memory or references from some third person point of view and call that learning.  If we did, we’d be clueless about our own emotions. Maybe… Maybe I’m being ridiculous. I said it myself; I’m a lot stronger than I was before. I shouldn’t ignore a great opportunity just because I’m afraid of facing my own emotions. I sighed as I led Epona and Russell onwards, heading across a wooden bridge into our village. “Fine then, I admit it. I’ve been running away from myself for too long and I need to give myself a chance to heal.” I snapped, feeling completely pathetic.
	Russell sighed. “I don’t need you to admit anything; I just want you to be truthful with yourself. It’s completely natural to avoid putting yourself in painful situations. But you can’t do it so much that you depict yourself as a coward…”
	Hearing that word made me stop dead in my tracks and I spun around to face him, giving him a steely glare. “I am NOT a coward.”
	Russell stopped about as abruptly as I did, holding his hands up like he was surrendering to me. “Ok, ok. I take that back. All I mean to say is that sometimes you have to take a risk, even if that risk puts you or your emotions in harm’s way. Some of those risks involve responsibilities. Didn’t you once say that you felt it right to take over your brother’s place in the village?”
I let my gaze soften and I sighed. “Yeah… I remember that. But saying it and doing it are two completely different things.” I said, turning around and leading Epona onwards. 
Russell continued to follow behind me, making quiet footsteps as he did. “Well, running away from his memory isn’t going to make it any easier to fulfill that responsibility. And maybe… maybe travelling the land of Hyrule will prepare you for that. It made your brother very strong; I’d imagine that it will do the same for you.”
	I didn’t answer to that remark. I just walked onwards, waving a silent goodbye as we parted ways. I kept walking past the cottages of our village, Ordon, not even daring to look at the one place where the memory of my family remained; the cottage under the great oak tree in the very middle of Ordon Village. It was where I once lived along with my family for the first 10 years of my life. But then, it happened, and I vowed never to step foot into that horrid memory ever again. I led Epona through Ordon, heading to the very back of the village where we had a huge cornfield, planted and well grown. After walking through the stalks of corn, we came to a lone hill where a single tree stood. There was a house built up in that tree, still in great shape from when I first built it 8 years ago, with only a little help from Russell, when I was only a boy. 
           I tied Epona to a post I kept by my house, unloading the wood Russell and I had placed on her back and laying each plank against the tree. I remembered everything… the times when nothing mattered. When I was young and I still had my family living alongside me, a place where I knew I belonged. I wished so desperately that I had all of that back. I wished that I could see my brother’s face and spar each other with wooden swords again. I wished that I could come home after searching for berries in Faron Woods to the smell of Mom’s cooking and the warmth of Dad’s smoky fire the fireplace. I wished so badly that they were alive and I could feel their unconditional love. When I had them, I felt like I had a beginning. Without them, I feel like I exist… just to exist. Like I have no real purpose.
       It makes me wonder if anyone else in the village truly knows what hell I went through. Especially Russell. He has a beautiful family. He has a son named Colin who’s really shy, but very strong-willed and healthy. His wife, Uli, is a wonderful person who is currently bearing their second child. They’re all a perfect family that stands up for each other and looks out for one another, keeping together with a bond that was so much more than words alone. They have everything I lost. Do they ever think about how scared I am? Do they ever try to understand that I am slowly and painfully dying inside and I hardly have anything left of me?
       I felt my eyes burn as I fought back tears. I’ve told myself so many times that it’s wrong to envy them. I can’t hate them because they have something I don’t anymore. But it’s so hard not to feel a little jealous, or… more like complete hopelessness. I know that they care about me. I know that they have tried everything they could to help me when I was young and that they’re still trying to help me now that I’ve grown. But it’s still so hard. All those memories are still too real… all those emotions are still eating me alive. It’s not like I can just stop it. It’s my curse… I can’t trust myself to be strong anymore… and it’s become a curse I can’t get myself to break.

At the beginning of the Four Swords Adventures manga, Link is referred to as the ""left-handed hero"" after defeating pirates that were raiding a Hylian town.

Not until motion technology did Nintendo compromise this well defined character. The original release of Twilight Princess saw Link as the southpaw that he really is. However when they converted the game for the wii console they made him right-handed to accommodate the majority of the population. Not only did they make Link right-handed but they were too lazy to just remake his character model. They simply just mirrored the entire game. In the original, Link (and the Stalfos spirit that teaches him the advanced sword techniques) is left-handed and every enemy is right-handed; pictured [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=udYixLHp8lg#t=610s). However, when they mirrored it, Link became right-handed and EVERY OTHER CHARACTER became left-handed; pictured [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMVjZApXnE8&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=13s). Even the official artwork for Twilight Princess made him left-handed.

I just think they could have made accommodations for both at least. Like to be able to choose whether you want to play the game right or left-handed. I'm right-handed but i'd still play it left-handed. 

And now, of course, that it's more convenient for Nintendo, they have compromised Link completely and made him entirely right-handed for Skyward Sword.

I just think it's lazy and incompetent on Nintendo's part to compromise the main character of 18 game titles over 25 years.

Link is left-handed. And he always will be.",,False,,t5_2tfzp,1354555959.0,,,True,t3_146xas,http://www.reddit.com/r/truezelda/comments/146xas/link_is_lefthanded_whos_with_me/,
