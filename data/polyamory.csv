1364841934.0,285,self.polyamory,1bfucv,"Dinner with my daughter, her boyfriend, his other girlfriend and her other boyfriend.",338,53,46,http://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1bfucv/dinner_with_my_daughter_her_boyfriend_his_other/,"A few weeks ago, I posted to this community about my daughter, EM, who is in a relationship with a man who has another girlfriend who also has another boyfriend.  Following the advice of this community and the advice of my therapist, whom I see for unrelated anxiety issues, I invited them all to dinner yesterday.  (My husband is traveling, so we are having “our” Easter next week.)  My daughter suggested the group come to our house to make it.

I confess I was incredibly nervous to let a swarm of strangers descend on my kitchen, but it ended up a lot better than I expected.  My daughter made a salad, and her boyfriend, RA, made roast lamb and seasoned rice.  They also made stuffed mushrooms as appetizers.  His other girlfriend, TL confessed to being “rubbish in the kitchen,” and insisted on “staying out of the way” and playing Scrabble with me while we waited for dinner. (I’m sure my daughter told her I like Scrabble, and it was nice to have something to do instead of suffering through small talk completely undistracted.)  She set the table and later did dishes, which was pleasant enough even though she didn’t know where anything was.  Her other boyfriend, JM, made cocktails and crème brulee, and kept checking on us “to make sure TL isn’t committing any war crimes on the English language.”

I’m not sure if any other parents frequent this forum, but if they do, I have some advice for them:  Make-at-home dinner.  I think it helped a lot being able to see my daughter and her “family” working together, laughing together and helping each other, before sitting down to eat.  I also appreciated having tasks to do with TL, both playing Scrabble and showing her where dishes were.  It gave us an chance to talk without having talking be the spotlight of our initial interaction.

TL and I were the ones with most opportunity to talk, no doubt a clever move orchestrated by my daughter because TL is the person who I had been viewing as an obstacle to RA committing to her.  She says she sees EM as a younger sister, and seeing them interact together, I believe it.  They don’t seem to be competing with each other for RA’s attention at all, and in fact they were going out of their way to make sure they each had enough time with him.  TL was even fishing for gift ideas for EM and RA’s anniversary, which I had never even considered was something she, as “the other woman,” would care about.

Talking with my therapist, including in some pair-counseling sessions with my daughter, we discovered a big problem with my outlook had been framing the relationship model as similar to “dating around,” when one person dates multiple partners separately with the intention of narrowing it down to one monogamous partner.  Even though my daughter had been telling me that this is not the case, I was still reacting as if it were.  Seeing the group together really helped me to see that TL was not taking RA away from my daughter.  In fact, they were all solicitous and caring of each other.

I still have concerns about EM moving in with these people, but I think those are the usual concerns of an emptying nest.  I’m embarrassed about how long I have been putting off meeting these people who are so important in EM’s life, how scared they made me, and how angry, and then how they turned out to be…really nothing to worry about.  I’m just thankful that my daughter and her relationship did not hold against me my fears, concerns, or, yes, even my prejudice.  I judged them unfairly and they turned the other cheek.

Next week, when my husband is back home, we are having another Easter dinner.  EM told me she may choose that time to tell him about RA, TL and JM.  If she does, I know I will stand by her side.  By their sides.",,False,self,t5_2qu5n,False,,,True,t3_1bfucv,http://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1bfucv/dinner_with_my_daughter_her_boyfriend_his_other/,

My girlfriend has kids from a previous marriage, both of them are in their teens. She has two policies with her kids: if they ask her any questions, about anything, ever, she will be honest with them. She will also always try to share the most important aspects of her life with them.

As a result, they know that she's poly. They know she's been poly since she divorced their father about ten years ago. They also know she's bisexual.

She went out to dinner with her kids the other night, with the intention of telling them about me. They already know about our boyfriend. So she explained to them that she's not only seeing Boyfriend, she's seeing me, too.

Her son didn't really seem to care. ""Whatever, that's nice, Mom."" Her daughter was much more interested, and asked questions about me. She told her daughter that I was a geek, and was into comic books and video games, and was hoping to go dressed as Chell from the video game Portal for an upcoming nerd convention.

Later, after dinner, she and her kids were at a quirky little book store, and her son wandered away. A little while later, he returned with a bag and said, ""I bought this for your girlfriend.""

It was a key chain.

It was a Portal gun key chain.

I was almost in tears when she told me the story.

Whenever any Free Hug campaign or hippy free love culture is mentioned positively, I somehow link whatever is discussed to polyamory, and immediately disdain the subject of discussion.

If my girlfriend ever suggested polyamory, I would instantly break up with her on principle, no matter what stage the relationship is in.

You probably think I'm an unpleasant, judgmental bastard.

You'd be right.

But in the interest of improving oneself and not being Yahweh in the flesh, I've come here seeking stories of how polyamory gave you happiness. It may not be for me, but I do not want to waste my hate on a concept that is not inherently evil.

I have only met this man a few times, he is no longer welcome in my house because my husband and I think he is taking advantage of our daughter.  She says his other girlfriend is her ""friend,"" but they are both older than she is (she is 27, they are in their early 30's) and I think they are manipulating her.  I think the other woman may be bisexual and trying to seduce her.

I have tried to get along with this man, and have been polite to him on the rare occasions I have met him.  But I believe my daughter is good enough to have a man who really loves her, and I don't think he does, because he has another girlfriend.

Now she is thinking about moving in with this man, his girlfriend, and her other boyfriend.  She says she's happy but I don't believe she can be in this situation.  She is an only child and has never had to have affection split between her and someone else, so I don't think this relationship is sustainable.  I think they are taking advantage of her and manipulating her into thinking she is happy.  I have tried waiting it out, but the fact that she is going to move in with them, and they are even talking about having kids, really worries me.  It means that when it all goes wrong, there is so much more to lose.

She has tried to tell me that ""love is infinite"" and made analogies about children, but it doesn't work. I am glad she's an only child because I don't know if I would have loved her enough if I had more children.  I admit that I loved my husband less after she was born.  She's my baby, my bright star, and she is unique and precious and singular.  In my experience, love is *not* infinite.  Why should she settle for being with someone who only wants her some of the time, who only loves her with half his heart?

He is the only one with an income right now and he was at work while my boyfriend and I are using the kayaks my husband bought and using the gas he paid for. 

He knows I am showing my boyfriend the beautiful lake my husband and I found together. We are out having fun and he is working. He wants me to enjoy myself and my boyfriend too. 

You can't get that from cheating. 

It's not about the money. I just brought that up to show the extremes of his giving. I doubt I can explain but I realized just how giant our love is and how my having a boyfriend I love not just a FWB has made me love and appreciate my husband more. 

Thank you for letting me gush. ",,False,self,t5_2qu5n,False,,,True,t3_1ihwpr,http://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1ihwpr/my_great_polyamorous_epiphany/,

1372426802.0,174,self.polyamory,1h8wd9,Fuck ups I've made in non-monogamy and how to avoid them,207,33,40,http://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1h8wd9/fuck_ups_ive_made_in_nonmonogamy_and_how_to_avoid/,"I put this up on fetlife a couple of days ago and it went down well. Thought you guys might like it.

I’ve got two boyfriends. Two deadly, amazing, wonderful boyfriends. I’ve been seeing one for just over 2 and a half years and the other for a year. Thus far, I’ve managed not to fuck it up completely. Somehow. Fuck knows how. Probably mostly luck. Anyhoo, this track record of having thus far not fucked things up entirely and being actually very happy has put me in a funny position; people ask me my opinion a lot. My opinion on polyamory, open relationships and advice on generalised sluttery. So for those of you who want it, here’s my handy dandy cut-out-and-keep guide/FAQ to what I’ve figured out in the last few years.

DISCLAIMER: There is no one twue way with this shit. Fuck, even the people I’m in a relationship with will probably disagree with bits of the following.

So, in no coherent order whatsoever:

1. Rules. Bollocks to rules. When you put rules in place the natural inclination is to find loopholes. You end up violating the spirit of the rule while following it to the letter, which is sneaky and no good for trust (and, baby, trust is what it’s all about. More on trust to follow). What you want, really, is operating principles; a system of good practice; good motherfucking habits. That’s what you want. Most of this list is kind of an outline of what I think are good operating principles.

There are a couple of exceptions to the “no rules” rule, though. Mostly around sexual health and safer sex. You have to work out where the limits are on that for yourself, though.

2. It’s ALL about trust. Everything else sits on a foundation of trust. Good ways to build trust are:

-Do what you fucking say you will. Be consistent. Never, ever promise someone you’ll do X if there’s a chance you won’t be able to follow through on that. Remember, kids: under-sell and over-deliver. Remember that one time you were waiting for a plumber who said he would show at 11am on Tuesday and you took the day off work and sat around all day and he called you at 4pm to say he couldn’t show today and you hated him so, so much that you wanted to set his van on fire? Don’t be that guy, because people remember when you failed to do what you said you would, regardless of how seldom that is.

-Never fib, fudge the truth or indulge in lies of omission. They will come back to bite you in the ass so very hard. Even little inconsequential ones are dangerous because they set precedent.

-TELL YOUR PARTNER THINGS BEFORE THEY ARE FORCED TO ASK. FUUUUUCK, I AM SHOUTING BECAUSE THIS IS IMPORTANT.

-If possible, tell them about things in advance of them happening. If you are told about something after the fact, when it was a spontaneous thing, try not to lose the rag. These things happen.

3. You love your partner, right? Or at least you like them. I’m going to presume you at least like them because why would you be fucking them / romantically involved with them otherwise? That would be silly. Since you like them, I’m going to presume you don’t think they’re a fucking cretin. I’m also going to presume you don’t think they’re a giant asshole, for the same reasons. If so, cut them some slack! Don’t try to control their interactions with other people too much. They’re with you, so they must have pretty good taste, right? Trust them to manage their own relationships. This is the reason I think vetos are horseshit. They’re too easily abused for a start. The exception to this is if you have privileged information regarding someone that your partner is interested in being bad news of some sort. Then you should present that information to your partner. If they want to bang someone you personally despise, then you can say “I’d rather you didn’t, as I personally despise that person for reasons X, Y and Z.” And you know what? They probably won’t. Because they like you enough to be involved with you and probably don’t want to make you sad. See? There’s no real practical application for vetos. “Because I say so” (which is basically what a veto is) is a bullshit reason for someone not to see someone. If it’s an appropriate reason to give your partner, that is probably because they are 7 years old and you’re a sicko.

4. We, as a species, are unfortunately not yet psychic. You must take someone on their word and not try to second-guess them too much. That way lies paranoia and eventual insanity. For christ’s sake, talk to each other. And work on being a good listener. Don’t argue to win, argue to negotiate. Try to be calm and reasonable when your partner is telling you things you might be less than thrilled about so that they feel safe telling you things in general. Nobody likes feeling like they’re invoking a shit-storm every time they try to voice their feelings.

5. BE KIND! If there is something that will make your partner wildly happy but will bum you out a little or inconvenience you a bit, suck it up. Conversely if there’s something that would make you a little bit happy, but would make your partner abjectly miserable, shut up and stop pestering them to bring you to funderland if it was the scene of the brutal death of their childhood dog Popsy or whatever. But, you know, the slutty sex version of that analogy. DO NOT BE A DOORMAT. Voice your feelings as accurately as possible.

6. Don’t go hunting unicorns (or waterfalls). Relationships and sexual attraction are supercomplex. It’s hiiiiighly fucking unlikely that you’re going to meet someone who is equally attracted to both of you. Just do stuff with people you like and allow your partner to do the same. You never know how things might go.

7. Be careful with your language. I fucking ABHOR hierarchical polyamory. If you label someone as secondary, you’re automatically boxing them into that role. Language shapes our perception of the world. Every relationship, whether you’re monogamous or poly or single or slutty or whatever, de facto starts as tertiary or whatever you want to call it. Fucking shades into dating shades into casual relationship shades into serious relationship. Some stay casual forever and that’s cool. Some get serious. Also cool. But if you refer to someone as secondary you are:

a) telling them from the off that THEY AS A PERSON ARE LESS IMPORTANT THAN SOMEONE ELSE. Which is horrible, and

b)making it difficult for the relationship to progress in its own happy little way. I mean, do you level up from secondary to primary or something? Like, you collect enough relationship tokens and BAM fireworks and a certificate of achievement? Pssshhh.

8. Remember, all people involved are PEOPLE. They deserve respect, autonomy, consideration and kindness. Your metamours are not your rivals. They are someone that someone you like likes. Don’t encroach on their space or generally treat them in any way you would not like to be treated.

9. Question: Hey quellehorreur, how do I navigate social situation Y with my plethora of lovers?
Answer: I have no fucking idea. There’s no etiquette book for this crap. Talk to everyone and check to see if everyone’s happy.

Don’t worry if you fuck up once in a while. It happens. I’m completely certain I’ve fucked up on every single one of these points. Multiple times. I just try not to do it so much as I go. I’m naturally a controlling asshole, though, so it means biting my tongue so much that it’s got permanent teeth marks. But when I think of the two wonderful men I love, it’s oh so worth it.

1352480510.0,174,self.polyamory,12x51d,My girlfriend came out as monogamous,204,30,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/12x51d/my_girlfriend_came_out_as_monogamous/,"Quick history:

My girlfriend and I met a few years ago. At the time she had another boyfriend, but was basically his secondary. I was dating but didn't have anything else serious going on at the time. So we hit it off and quickly became primary-ish lovers and wound up moving in with each other.

About a year and a half ago she broke up with her other boyfriend. Since then, she hasn't had much interest in dating again, and there haven't been any other guys since him. Meanwhile I've dated and had other relationships basically the whole time we've been together (though as I write this I don't have any other relationship to speak of.)

Anyway, the other night we were talking, she brought up the fact that she doesn't really date and told me that she intends to be monogamous from here on out. That I'm all she needs, and she's happiest with me and only me. She's still totally supportive of me being poly; still wants me to date and find another girlfriend, because she knows I'm happiest when I have that and she's happiest when I'm happiest (and vice versa). I told her that was fine, and that of course she's free to change her mind down the road if she ever wanted to be poly again. Which she's grateful for, but says just doesn't interest her anymore.

I don't have any questions for the community or anything. I just wanted to share what an awesome girlfriend I have :)",,False,self,t5_2qu5n,False,,,True,t3_12x51d,http://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/12x51d/my_girlfriend_came_out_as_monogamous/,

Coming into this polyfidelous triad, we were all new to poly, and I was certainly a bit insecure. The one boundary we set to start was no penile sex for the two of them until I was comfortable. They both agreed with no issues, and were willing to wait so as not to disrespect my coming to terms w my insecurities. They even helped me talk about them and start to work through them. They were both incredibly understanding and patient.  Now while this boundary helped me come to terms w my new polyamory slowly, it started to feel confining to their relationship. While we are a triad, I shouldnt dictate their individual relationship. For about a week, I struggled with wondering how Id react, and why did I need tthis boundary. I was talking myself in circles. So finally I said, enough with this! I told my husband and gf that they were ok to explore whatever they wanted/needed too, and that I wasn't going to control any aspect of their relationship anymore. I was soooooooo nervous... it took so much courage to do this. But, last night they had sex, and while I was anxious and stressed about it, im doing great today. Im so happy! Not only is that weight off my shoulders, but they get to enjoy each other completely. I feel that this is a great step towards the three of us absolutely opening up about every aspect of our relationships, and will bring us closer together as a triad.

I apologize for the length, but thank you to the people who read it all. :)


I'm a monogamous woman, and I started browsing this section out of curiosity. The lifestyle of the polyamorous is one I admit I did not know a lot about, but reading your stories and posted articles has helped me learn a lot about the community. 


The more I looked into it, the more I found there were a LOT of really great couples who'd been poly for decades, and I also found couples who said being polyamorous has helped them stay together. 


Thank you, r/polyamory, for teaching me that these types of relationships can work very well for many people! :) Starting out, I didn't know much about this community at all.


But I do have one issue. In my browsing, I saw a lot of comments making monogamous people out to be overly jealous, suppressing of their feelings, not open minded, not honest with their partner, etc. 
I understand a lot of monogamous relationships have things that a successful poly relationship does not. However, please don't label all monogamous people as being like this. 


In my monogamous relationship, my fiance and I have the freedom to discuss how we feel. We both know who the other person finds attractive, who they have crushes on- many of which are close friends, etc. And it's not an issue. (We'll actually point out people to each other if we think the other person would find them attractive!) We're very secure in our relationship- especially when it comes to not being afraid to lose the other person to someone else. 


We're also open minded and accepting of other ideas and lifestyles. The thing is, while we're open-minded for other peoples' actions, there are just some things that we agree are not right for us. We've discussed the idea of bringing another person in the bedroom (just as a casual conversation) and both agreed that while the thought is arousing, the reality wouldn't be one we'd like to have happen. 
Please know that the lines of communication for us on these issues is very much open- we just choose not to take the step that other types of relationships have.


It doesn't mean we're prone to jealousy, that we don't talk about our feelings, or that we aren't open-minded- it just means we've made a different choice for our relationship that we feel works best *for us*.

On that note, I'm also very happy for all of you here at polyamory for the relationships you have. Love knows no boundaries, and no one form of love is better then another- being in love is a personal thing that cannot be defined by words like ""monogamy"" or ""polyamory"" or anything else. 


In short, thank you for helping me learn more about your community, please understand that not all monogamous people are missing out or in ""lesser"" relationships, and I'm very happy to see so many of you in loving relationships with people who have made your life a better place.


EDIT: I understand not EVERY poly person disses monogamy, and I also know not EVERY mono person disses polyamory. As another commenter pointed out, narrow-minded people exist in ALL walks of life. None of what I said is meant to be malicious or a negative thought towards polyamory in any way.",,False,self,t5_2qu5n,True,,,True,t3_p4xmn,http://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/p4xmn/monogamous_woman_here_just_a_few_things_i_would/,

1344453207.0,145,self.polyamory,xw9u3,So... I lost my job after revealing that I am poly,164,19,122,http://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/xw9u3/so_i_lost_my_job_after_revealing_that_i_am_poly/,"Well... I recently finished being a student and got my first big girl job. It was tough, with a fairly long commute and wasnt exactly what I wanted, but it was money and the working environment was pleasant.

Anyway, last week my supervisor asked me what my plans were this weekend and I said ""oh, I'm seeing my girlfriend"" without thinking. They already knew about my boyfriend who I live with and were naturally full of questions. I am not particularly good at staying in the closet very long, but I never really thought much of it. All of a sudden the atmosphere at work changed really dramatically and my supervisors became quite cold/distant from me. 

The next day I received a formal written warning that I was making too many typos on documents -nothing ever went out to customers with a typo or anything, but when they looked over my shoulder they noticed that I was making a fair few as I typed - fairy nuff, I thought I would just type extra slow and make sure that I did it ok. (I should make it clear, my job was a legal contracts  adviser, not a typist). The next week goes by and I do my best to avoid typos like the plague. I made one in an entire week (and typed REEEEAAAALY SLOW) but I made it though with just the one.

Today I was called in by the boss and told that I had not improved at all and that I was still making far too many mistakes. I asked for an example, and he could not give me one. I told him of my one typo and asked what the issue was. He told me it was that I had failed to meet the standards of the company and that nothing I could say at this point could prevent my employment being terminated. I was gobsmacked, literally speechless.

I had only been working there 3 weeks today and had been told prior to my ""coming out"" that I was doing a fantastic job and was exceeding expectation. There was no informal warning nor any review of performance short of what I mentioned (after all, it had only been 3 weeks). I cant help but feel that somehow I would still have a job if only I had kept quiet. 

So, I kinda wanted to sob a little to /r/poly and just ask if anyone else has had these kinds of things happen. I know there is nothing I can do, and nothing I can prove, I just know in my heart of hearts that it felt so unfair and occurred immediately after revealing my that I am bisexual and poly (and just in a passing comment, no gory inappropriate details or anything) and I feel that such a dramatic and unreasonable change cant be that much of a coincidence. 

At the very least, I can say I get more comfort, love and support than I could ever ask for from my loving partners and not to mention, friends, family and reddit!",,False,self,t5_2qu5n,False,,,True,t3_xw9u3,http://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/xw9u3/so_i_lost_my_job_after_revealing_that_i_am_poly/,

Folks, remember: you do not know the perfect way to be poly, that will work for everyone. You don't. You might follow a few rules **of your own** that many here will agree with - but they will not apply to everyone. 

You don't like it, I know, some of you flat out hate it, but there *are* people out there for whom a OPP works. There are happy unicorns who have found their unicorn hunters. There are poly couples who do it primarily for the sex - this does not make them swingers or ""non-poly"". 

Quit trying to TELL people in this sub ""how to do it right."" It's ridiculous. There are many paths. Here's the only true way to be polyamorous:

Step 1: Don't be monogamous.

I know a bunch of you, especially those who seem new here, want to categorize and list out a bunch of rules, and give us all lists. You want to define it, and you want to speak for the majority, and you want to be an expert. Nobody asked you, but you're going to tell us all the perfect way to be perfectly poly.

Quit it. You're wrong. 

If someone ASKS a question, yeah, go for it and give your opinion. But this sub is changing, and I don't like what I'm seeing from the know-it-alls that have been popping up here. I came here to NOT be judged in my lifestyle. I'd say a bunch of us here enjoy the sub for the same reason.

Some background:
I grew up with my Mom, my Mommy, and my Dad. They were in a closed V, with Mom in the middle. Mommy and Dad did try to make it a triangle, but it never worked. The V formed in the mid 70s, if I remember correctly. They were together for 20-some-odd years. They did break up around 2000, for fairly complex reasons. It was a combo of personality conflicts and lingering trauma from a murder in the family, as far as I've been able to piece together.

My parents were closeted about the poly. Mommy was ""a friend of the family"". I'm told it was pretty obvious to anyone open-minded enough to look past the legal marriage between Mom and Dad.

I was born in the mid-80s, my elder sister in the late 70s. I definitely grew up with poly and bisexuality as my default. That's shifted a bit over the years. I'm now more lesbian than bi and am in a not-actively-poly domestic partnership (curse you, Californiaaa!). I'm also a pre-medical student interested in [sexual minority health](http://openmindedhealth.com/).

So! Ask me anything. :) I'll answer if I can.

Edit for clarification: My parents were closeted to the outside world about poly, but us kids totally knew. See comments for details.",,False,self,t5_2qu5n,True,,,True,t3_isvp3,http://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/isvp3/i_grew_up_in_a_poly_household_ama/,

Married the love of my life 7 years ago, been together over 10 years, poly the entire way. We make a spectacular couple - in our time together, I can only recall 3 actual arguments, and all of those were mediated through communication and worked through. She and I complement each other perfectly. 

We do both, however, enjoy polyamory and having other relationships. Light swinging with friends at times, but much more often, we pursue deeper relationships with others - she currently has a BF of 4 years (and I think this may be a lifelong thing for them) that lives with us when he's home from deployment. He and I get along fantastically. I also have several GFs, the most serious of which we will call C. My wife and I tend to share her relationshipwise - my wife is extremely bi, and she and C have a thing for each other as well. C and I have been in love for 2 years, and she is also military, so I only get to see her when her duties allow. 

She deployed last year, and I have been kinda bummed with missing her at the same time that my wife is bummed at her BF being in the sandbox. C finally returned home last week, to her base 300 miles from us, and the plan was that she'd arrive Friday night at long last. I had been looking forward to this like a kid awaiting Xmas. 

Thursday is ""cheat night"" for our diet. My wife and I usually order from a local excellent restaurant that delivers and wallow in carbs for that one meal a week. Keeps us on the diet. I came home, did some work on our home business, and around 8:45, I realized she hadn't ordered dinner yet. 

When I asked her about this, she noted that she had, and it was on the way. I must have just not noticed.

When the food arrived, the deliveryperson was short - quite short - and hidden behind the bags of food. When I greeted them... C stuck her head from behind the bags and said ""Do I get the tip?""

Turns out she and my wife had C had planned this. C found a way to get an extra day of leave, so the two of them ganged up and pranked me again. 

They tend to do these kinds of things to me. I'm doooooomed.

**TL;DR: Wife and our favorite GF had said GF arrive a day early, after a long deployment in the military.**

My good friend Ben has obtained the rights to the world famous Polyamory guidebook ""The Ethical Slut""! He has won awards for his previous web-series ""Cynthia Watros gets lost"" and now plans on making a web-series based on the guidebook filmed in Madison, WI. this summer. The first season will be 12 episodes each about 10 minutes long. Ben has tasked me with reaching out to the polyamory communities so at the very least we could get some ideas and insight into some things this community would like to see portrayed in the Web-series based on the book ""The Ethical Slut"".

We have also started a kickstarter campaign to raise some money to pay for good talent, and other cost associated with filming. 

http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1140659809/ethical-slut?ref=city

There are some really cool rewards, especially to anyone that has a close connection with this book and most of them are really affordable. For instance you can become an on-screen extra to playing a role in the series yourself. There is even a level to receive recognition as an Executive Producer! 

Like I said, If you can't join the kickstarter campaign, at the very least we would really appreciate if this community could give some input or ideas you think are worth exploring in the series, I would love to hear them as well! I'm sure ""The Ethical Slut"" has a lot of significant meaning or has helped some of you along the way in your quest for successful Polyamorous living. Nows your chance to help it continue to stay in the spotlight and to help others!

Thank you and I hope to hear back from some of you.

My husband and I have been together for 10 years (we are both in our early 30s) and we love each other very deeply. We've been poly for the last five years and we both have had multiple other partners. We've always had our rules and one is that we never would put someone else ahead of each other. And that we would be careful. 

I'm just learning he broke both our rules. Since we became poly I've had more partners than him but my partners have been less serious. He has had three serious girlfriends and a couple short term flings. I've had maybe 10-15 flings since we started and a couple longer relationships (but nothing as serious as his GFs). He hasn't been supportive of my relationships like I have of his but he hasn't been jealous either. He doesn't like to talk about my poly experiences and I have always tried to respect that. 

My husband started to date a new girl around last November. This girl is a little plainer than his normal type but she seemed nice enough. We never struck up a friendship but I just figured she must be shy and it would be awkward to be friends with your boyfriend's wife... especially if you are new to poly. As it always is things were amazing with them at first and I cheered my husband on. I was happy to see him happy. But I noticed they had become more secretive and he started to be less caring and loving to me. 

Well fast forward to today and my husband tells me that he is leaving me and wants a divorce immediately. He told me I am a slut and a failure as a wife since I never gave him a child (we have had three miscarriages over the last four years so that was extra shitty of him to say). He told me that he hated when I went and slept with other guys and he regretted ever meeting me. Keep in mind he never once told me this before. And then to just twist the knife in more he told me that he is leaving me because his new girlfriend is so awesome and he can't bear the thought of cheating on her. And she is pregnant. I begged him to stay and reconsider and he told me he made his decision and we are over. 

I don't know what to do. I just feel abandoned and lost and destroyed. I don't have anyone IRL I can talk about this to. I can't believe my own husband would do this to me. I can't believe my marriage is over and I can't believe that my husband is having a baby with someone else other than me. I'm not a hateful person but I truly, truly hate his girlfriend more than I've ever hated anyone. I am angry at him but I just want him to come home too. Does anyone have any advice for me? I know this is a bit more of a relationship question but I felt more comfortable posting here. 

EDIT: Thank you, thank you, thank you to everyone who has posted advice and support. It means so much to me. You guys are awesome!

I think what hurts more than him leaving is how much he betrayed me. He would always just say things were meh with the GF to me (even when things were clearly awesome). He lied about using condoms with her. I've never once let someone else not use condoms. That was one of our major rules. And his GF is 16 weeks pregnant so they have known for a while and he never spoke a word to me. Its just so fucked up. How could my partner do me like this? A lot of the things he said were so hurtful and he knows what hurts me and used that to his advantage. It was just cruel. I wish I still didn't love him or care but I do. I'm going to try to take my mind off of all of this. ",,False,self,t5_2qu5n,1344532799.0,,,True,t3_xxfr9,http://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/xxfr9/my_husband_wants_a_divorce_to_be_with_his/,

Poly agreements are usually best negotiated towards the start of a relationship but they help define it over time and people can refer back when there are problems to determine where the issues lay when they crop up.  These might help and they're the ones I make with my partners.  They have to be mutual.

1.I will maintain my own mental and physical health, safety, and well-being.  

2.If new partners are going to become involved with me sexually, I will tell you.  

3.I will never leave you for someone else nor at someone else's request.  If I leave, it is because our relationship has become abusive, unhealthy, or dangerous.  

4.What I do with my other partners should not damage our relationship.  If it begins to, see 1 and 3.  

5.I will leave an open line of communication for negotiation about our relationship, be it a specific time to talk, a specific method we need to use, or a particular place. 

6.We can renegotiate our relationship at any time.  You are free to leave if you choose to. 

7.Legal bindings must be negotiated with 1-6 in mind wherever possible.  

8.I will dedicate a portion of my time to making sure your needs are met.  If your needs change, I will be flexible using 5 and 6 to try to make sure we can keep said needs met.  

Any thoughts you guys might have on these would be wonderful.  I think they're a pretty healthy set of ideas.  

**EDIT**:Someone brought up to me that this is a pretty healthy set of ideas for *all* relationships.  Hadn't occurred to me until just now.  Heee!

I've noticed that the rule most people seem to employ here amounts to ""polyamory is loving however/whoever makes you happy ... as long as you aren't unicorn-hunting, don't have a OPP, etc"".

I think more people should realize that some individuals/couples **want** to have a OPP, exclusively pursue closed polyfidelitous triads, or even (however rarely) just want to be a NSA sex toy for a hot couple. And this list is not exhaustive ... remember: *if you can dream it, there's probably some people who dig it*.

Just because someone hasn't gravitated to your particular set of no-rules-except-my-rules polyamory doesn't mean they aren't open-minded or will someday see it your way ""when they mature"". They might just be content with what they are doing already.

All I'm sayin' is that maybe you shouldn't jump on and hate. Unicorns do exist, maybe that ""immature"" couple who made a post right in the middle of your lions' den will actually find one. It doesn't matter that you don't want to be a unicorn or wish they'd let your dick enter the playing field ... just wish them luck and move along to someone who is asking for you!

In my case, I'm the wifey in the relationship and actually designed in the OPP myself (go ahead: start pontificating about how it's early in the relationship and things evolve, but we've been happily running this way for 7+ years). In fact, I'm so weird in the head that I want him to sleep with hot girls with or without me, while I only want to do so with him ... the only rule in our case is that he (with her consent) takes vids/pics of his adventures. Mmm. :)

Our setup satisfies me completely as an individual and makes the love of my life happy as well, which is extraordinary icing on the cake.

The ceremony was absolutely beautiful and I got to take part in it as a bridesmaid, as well as representing one of the elements and tying one of the handfasting cords. They made an effort to have their chosen family (myself and our other bf/gf) be participants in their union. 

The bride's family and lots of friends (some of whom were poly/swinger folks) were there, and it felt so wonderful to be able to stand up in front of everyone and say ""I love you"" to them during my toast (with many people none the wiser). 

We were all tired as hell and fell asleep as soon as we got home, so the consummation got postponed until today. The bride had a stipulation that she would get his cock first after the wedding, which I had no problem with! I fluffed him for her, she had a couple great orgasms which I assisted with, and then I got some awesome cock. We've been so busy with wedding planning and prep that our sex life has been a bit on the backburner, but tonight was a great start to being back to normal!

Very much looking forward to the afterparty orgy/BDSM night next weekend that a friend is letting us host in his house.

I gave a brief explanation of poly and told him that this was something I've identified as since high school. My wife and I have been together for 4 years, and she knew I was poly when we met. We discussed being poly BEFORE we walked down the aisle. We were monogamous for 3 years, and finally opened up a year ago when she was ready. 

I never thought about coming out of the poly-closet before, but since we met our girlfriend I just want to tell everyone! I want to take her to Thanksgiving dinners, and the three of us to hold hands in public. Our girlfriend told her parents about us right away, and we were greeted with welcoming hugs. It gave me the courage and inspiration to tell my dad.

My dad is a very scientific, atheistic man and he kind of thought about it for a second and said ""You know, that seems to make more sense from a biological and evolutionary standpoint."" *lol* I love my dad. He had usual mono responses such as a concern for my happiness, an initial doubt about our commitment to our marriage, and questions about STD safety.

My dad has had to deal with so much from me- I told him I was bisexual when I was 12. I told them my wife (and then girlfriend) was transsexual when we met. And now this! And he's loved and accepted me every step of the way. I feel so lucky to have such an awesome parent. My mom is not in my life currently due to alcoholism, but I know if she was sober she would accept me, my wife and my girlfriend with open arms. My dad's marriage to her is very miserable and damaged. I think my dad is glad that I'm trying out an alternative because a traditional mono marriage hasn't worked out to well for him.

I reckon if you have to ask, if you have anxiety and uncertainty in your heart, it probably is too soon.

So my advice, as a secondary F, mid-30's, 8years poly to all you young people staring fresh, is to just chill out and enjoy yourself. Give things time to settle and mature. It's amazing how many anxieties and crisis will solve themselves or just no longer seem important 6 months from now. Not all, of course, but I swear to you an astonishing number of today's ""OMG!""'s are tomorrow's ""Heh, remember when we got all worked up about nothing? How silly were we?!"" 

This applies to being out, too- in my experience if you're calm and reasonable, people will follow your lead. If they don't, just wait them out, outrage is exhausting and most people will settle down if given time. After all, most people's main question at the end of the day is, ""Well, does it work?""

I'm supposed to start going to a church of their choice to start praying the gay away if I want to be one of the family ever again. 

This means I'm banned from my sister's wedding in October - where I was supposed to be her maid of honor. Apparently, they all have had an issue with me being gay for several years and lied to my face about it until yesterday. This is just cruel. 

I love my family, despite them being extreme, right wing, fundamentalist Christians that raised me via religious brainwashing to hate myself bcs I couldn't stop liking girls instead of guys no matter how much I prayed and begged god to change me and make me straight. I tried to commit suicide on multiple occasions as a teen and young adult when I'd hit a particularly bad point of depression. So the fact that they're demanding I go back to that place seems like they're vindictive and intentionally trying to break me down until I will wholeheartedly submit to my dad. Why the fuck would I think it's a good/healthy thing to mindlessly submit to a guy who's doing his utmost to make me want to kill myself?!? 

He said that casting me out is their expression of love for me, as they are willing to do anything to get me to believe that my sexual orientation and relationship model is literally hurting me, and that every obstacle or bump in the road is a conclusive proof that I'm being punished for my sinful lifestyle choices. 

I'm just reeling from the extreme mood swing my family is having and the grief process dealing with this is so hard. I want to lash out and hurt them like they've hurt me, but that's not the kind of person I am or want to be. I want to show them kindness where they've spat hate. I want to show them forgiveness where they've judged and condemned me. But dammit it's tough when it's so sudden and revealed soooooo many lies they'd been spinning for ages. They're all great liars, never knew just how good they all are at being two-faced.

Have you considered whether a dog is a better fit?,121,26,87,http://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1ekx5q/please_remember_that_secondaries_are_human_beings/," We are not interchangeable Legos that you can plug into your life and rule system. We need to be included in decisions, (not dictated to) introduced to appropriate friends, neighbors, and family (not secreted away like lepers) and made to feel intrinsically valuable (thanks for the leftover/hand me down food/ furniture/clothing, but I like new things sometimes too.)  Its about basic dignity and courtesy. (Lovers like flowers just as much as wives do.)

If that's something you're not ready to provide, maybe you need a dog instead of a polyamorous relationship. If you're about to lay the rules down, or dodge a kiss in your driveway, or ban someone out of a holiday or family event ask yourself: is this Polyamorous expectation, or Golden Retriever expectation?

EDIT: To all you people recommending that I grew up, be patient, remember my place, be compassionate, remember the children, or just calm down: you're absolutely right. Two meals and a nap later I'm way less upset, and I'm prepared to chill the fuck out and work with this family in a more productive, less entitled way . I've come to the conclusion were dealing with culture and expectations more than anything, and I'm waaaay less pissed off.

1367762369.0,95,self.polyamory,1dqbt1,Fantastic Weekend / Poly Milestone,107,12,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1dqbt1/fantastic_weekend_poly_milestone/,"So this past weekend was really, really great and totally effing amazing! 

Background: my wife and I (10 years) opened up our marriage a little over a year ago.  We had dabbled (mostly successfully) with non-monogamy for almost six months when she and her now long distance boyfriend first met. 

Last weekend he flew into town for a four day weekend, and I don’t see how it could have gone any better. We had arranged in advance for our six year old to spend most of Saturday and Sunday with his aunt and uncle, so there was plenty of time for the grown ups to play. I could go on about the sex, (yes, it was terrific!) but for me the best part about the entire weekend was not about sex at all. 

Going in to the weekend, the two of them had already been dating for a while, and it was clear to everyone that they had fallen in love.  I had also realized by then that I really was fine with that.  Opening up our marriage had already given my wife and I the opportunity to rekindle our relationship, and the two of us are closer now than ever before. Sometime over the weekend though, my perspective shifted, and I realized that polyamory really works for me.

Over the course of the weekend, I was able to see first hand the love that the two of them share. I saw his eyes light up as she would walk into the room.  I helped as best I could while she fussed over a fancy dinner chosen just for him.  In dozens of other little ways, I witnessed just how much they each really care for each other.  At the same time, my fantastic wife found the time to go out of her way to make sure that I wasn't feeling neglected. 

Meanwhile, he and I really connected in a much more meaningful way than the two of us had before.  I realized that his love for my wife extends to me as well, and my love for her extends to him. I could feel my heart expand, and make more room for him in our lives, in my life.  Even though he and I have only recently become friends, I can now say honestly that I have accepted him into our family, and that I love this man. My life is better for having him be a part of it.

1357780673.0,97,self.polyamory,16a9xv,My wife's boyfriend saved our relationship &lt;3 what I am learning and why I love the poly community,115,18,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/16a9xv/my_wifes_boyfriend_saved_our_relationship_3_what/,"My wife and I have not been together long, less than a year in fact.  We married quickly because of immigration and health insurance issues, but are very much in love and fully intended on making things last when we made the decision.  Things were lovely for several months- we met some fun people, fooled around a bit, and communicated openly about each other's needs both sexually and emotionally.

Shit got very, very, bad however due to many issues compounding, old emotional baggage flaring up, arguments about money and my dissatisfaction with my job/general negativity.  I stopped being fully honest with her, our communication broke down to the point where she believed I cheated on her, whereas I thought I had her consent and she was at fault for my life seeming to spin out of control.  The brinksmanship went on until I told her we had to separate for a time to cool off and hopefully get some perspective, so I went on a vacation without her.

Before I left though, I told her to see someone else if that is what she wanted and that I would understand because I had been treating her so poorly. Sure enough, she called me during our ""break"" and told me she had been seeing someone she knew before and that I had met recently at a party.  When I got back from my trip, I felt like I had been replaced a bit. She wanted to date and/or have sex with him at least twice a week, but wouldn't have sex with me because she didn't feel close to me after all the fighting we had done.

I don't think I would have been able to get over my jealousy if it weren't for the fact that this guy is so incredibly awesome and caring it has inspired us to be waaaay better to each other.  He has been patient and considerate of my feelings the whole way since he knows she and I are still repairing things, and has shown me how to listen much more and be empathetic at all times.  Our downward spiral has reversed upwards and the love is compounding now :)  And the sex is ridiculously hot!

Personal lesson- Don't be a jerk someone you love, especially if your needs aren't being met.  Be patient, don't say what ""you""[your partner] did but rather explain your feelings and thought process as calmly and non judgmentally as you can. And if you are still talking past each other try to find a close friend who can be an intermediary.

About being poly - Having many lovers is so potentially wonderful because you are able to get closer to each other by having many points of reference.  My wife's bf understands her better in ways that I don't (they are more creative together, idealist, etc.)  Watching them interact allows me relate to both of them better and appreciate personality traits that before I only focused on how they clash with my own.  Likewise, she has observed that he and I interact differently than she and I do, and so she has more appreciation for me as well.  You can be each other's teachers when you share love with people you trust and admire, which is what it is all about :)

tl;dr- Conquering jealousy and being close with your lovers' lovers lets you all bond even closer.  Compromise whenever you can, it's better to bend than to break.

We started with the classic couple thing, looking for a unicorn.  Which we found.  Our relatsionship very soon developed into a triad, that wasn't about our gf dating us, but has 4 separate distinct relationships in it, his and hers, mine and hers, his and mine and all 3 of us. We also had an OPP which I understand makes some people, here get angry, but just keep reading.

So this triad is going along very nicely and we have almost been together for a year.  

My SO's both are recently divorced and are finding the emotional connection in our triad enough for them, although they are looking at swinging and exploring their sexuality in other ways.  

I have pretty much been single for most my life, I'm 32 now, and for me sex without an emotional connection is not as satisfying.  I would like another emotional connection.

So I have a guy friend, I've been crushing on, and over the last few months the 3 of us have talked it over.  My wonderful gf has been behind it pretty much from the beginning.  My bf is also wonderful, but has had a harder time with it. After much conversation he has decided that he can't let his fears keep me from happiness and he will work on his issues and insecurities with me and on his own.  

So tonight I have my first date with the potential new guy, of course I don't know yet if he has just ""friended"" me or if there is something else there yet.  But the anticipation is awesome.

Last night my bf gave me some condoms.  He knows I won't have sex on the first date, because I'm not wired that way.  But he gave them to me anyway, so that I would know he is ready for our relationship to change.

There are many, many of us out there, and I suspect most of the readers here are in fact Happy Polyamorous People.  We get a lot of posts asking for advice, and a fair number of comments from people who seem convinced that the poly thing doesn't work.

If I were new to the world of polyamory, just reading about it, and I took a look here at /r/polyamory, I'd probably think polyamory was a train wreck, since many the post are complaints, concerns, and questions.  People feel like this is a place they can go for advice - and they're right.  But there's more.

I'm here to say - polyamory works!  I've been doing the poly thing for about 7 years, myself.  Sometimes I have more than one partner, sometimes I don't.  Sometimes my partner(s) have other partners, sometimes they don't.

Sometimes the relationships go great, sometimes they don't - much like monogamy.  But in general, about polyamory itself?  I doubt I'll ever got back to monogamy.

So - other poly people?  I'd love to hear your comments about your GOOD experiences, and perhaps upvote this story if you're happily &amp; successfully polyamorous!",,False,self,t5_2qu5n,False,,,True,t3_1hkikr,http://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1hkikr/happy_poly_people_be_heard/,

I will admit that up until then I had been nervous, not jealous per se, but I truly didn’t know how I would react, this is my husband’s first OSO on his own. We had a gf together about a year ago and I had a gf for a while after that, so this was the “final poly test.” When I came back from a church event, my husband let me know that they taken my “permission” and gone ahead. The three of us hung out and watched a movie and then she left and my husband and I went to bed. We talked for a while after that.

We talked it out, and after that, one thing led to another and we had awesome sexy times together. :)

I may have opinions about the best way to handle a nasty co-worker, but my SO is not *required* to listen to them unless the problem has gotten so bad it's hurting me.

Until it affects me, my interest is limited to wanting to help a friend and share their troubles.  This is important, but *I don't get to give orders.*  They're an adult, and they can and should make decisions without me.

Certainly an agreement to avoid some particular outside commitment can be part of a relationship.  ""Don't get a job in a war zone"" is a popular prohibition, but some *Medcins sans frontières* is also a popular charity.

Taking on a new lover will almost certainly affect me, but if I'm told ""honey, I have a great career opportunity that will involve a big time commitment but I think will make me very happy"", most people agree I should listen seriously an not deny my partner the opportunity without good cause.

Why should ""honey, I have a great *relationship* opportunity that will involve a big time commitment but I think will make me very happy"" be so very different?",,False,self,t5_2qu5n,False,,,True,t3_o7a85,http://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/o7a85/minirant_polyamory_is_based_on_the_shocking/,
1374247114.0,90,self.polyamory,1imvod,How to open your marriage to a third,103,13,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1imvod/how_to_open_your_marriage_to_a_third/,"I wanted to write this as a bit of an orientation for people who are interested in adding a third person to their relationship as this is a pretty common way to want to start exploring polyamory.  Most commonly this is a male/female couple who are interested in finding a bisexual woman to date them both exclusively (though you can certainly have any gender in any of those roles!).  This is such a common place for couples interested in getting started in polyamory that it’s actually a cliché, and the term for it is “unicorn hunting”.

The first thing to realize about unicorn hunting is that, as the name implies it can be very difficult to find unicorns.  There are several reasons for that, but first and foremost think about what the dating opportunities look like for a hot, bisexual, sexually open woman.  Out of the limited pool of hot, bisexual, sexually open woman many of them are just not inclined to date a couple (more on that in a bit), and the ones that are have all the single people on the planet to pick from in addition to all those other unicorn hunters…the numbers are just not looking good for you.  The numbers get a lot worse if you’re picky and want to set your bar at “compatible” rather than “available”.

Let’s say you do manage to corner a unicorn though, and she’s theoretically interested in dating a couple and furthermore seems compatible with both you and your spouse.  Score! Right?  Well…no.  I did mention that line of interested people, and the 500 other offers to buy her a drink, right?  So now it’s time to talk about what you’re actually putting on the table relationship-wise for her when you’re asking her to date you two exclusively.  This is where the term unicorn hunter can take a bit of a derisive tone because most unicorn hunters haven’t thought this part through.

You and your spouse came to be looking for a third after a hell of a lot of talking.  You discussed fears, limits, boundaries and what you’re both looking for (or you sure as hell should have!).  A this point it’d be absurd if you each didn’t have some level of fear that adding a third will disrupt your existing relationship so you probably came up with rules to try and protect it.  These rules might be things like both original people always having a veto over the third, or no saying “I love you” to the new person, or no sex without condoms, or she can only have sex with both of us at once, or…well, all kinds of stuff that could be reserved between the original two people.  The term for this is “couples privilege” and just like unicorn hunting it’s extremely common.  

So put yourself in the shoes of this unicorn you’ve got cornered, that one who can date almost anybody on the planet and has a line formed behind you of people wanting her attention.  “Would you like to come join our relationship as a non-voting member that can be vetoed for doing nothing wrong and has a list of arbitrary constraints on what you can do which you never had any input on?  Now, we don’t want you seeing anybody else of course!”  On top of the explicitly stated rules is the unspoken one – you’re always secondary to our marriage, so don’t ever expect your needs to come first.  

You can see how this might be a deal that’s hard to close.  For the sake of argument though, let’s say you beat the odds and do manage to lure that unicorn back to your lair.  Now you’ll discover what very few unicorn hunters ever make it far enough to discover – you’ve skipped right over the kiddie pool and are chin-deep into advanced polyamory!  You managed to jump right into the 400 level college class without taking any of the pre-reqs because you thought you wouldn’t need to worry about them since you’re both dating the same person.  Nothing could be further from the truth!  

You’re still going to need to learn how to handle jealousy.  You’re still going to feel left out sometimes.  You’re still going to need to work tirelessly on improving your communication and emotional awareness.  But now you’re trying to juggle and balance things that never, ever grow exactly equally apace while you’re working on the basics.  Instead of adding one new relationship to the equation you’ve added 4 (because your relationship with your spouse is going to change and have new needs): A-B, A-C, B-C, A-B-C.  These are all separate relationship, each has its own needs, each will grow at its own pace, each will have its own problems, and each will impact all the others.  

How do you handle it when you get in a fight with one of your partners and you feel like both of them team up against you?  What happens when despite the “rules” your other two partners fall in love and you just don’t feel that strongly about the new girl?  How are you feeling when you have to go out of town on business and the two of them spend the whole week alone together in your bed? What about if you just need a little space but new girl is *ALWAYS* over to see your spouse?  What if you fall in love with her and your spouse starts hinting at a veto because they feel left out?  In addition to all this, there’s also a pretty good chance that the reason you managed to lure this particular unicorn back to your lair is because she’s never been around this particular block either, and since you’re all new nobody set expectations appropriately and she’s just finding out what it means that she’s a second-class partner.  That’s not a fun time for her.

Now, I’m not going to claim that this never works out, but overwhelmingly when you see that dude with his arms happily around two girls it’s because things were not approached as I describe above.  This is not doom and gloom, it really is a suggestion of how to open your marriage to a third more successfully. The key to successfully opening your marriage to another person is to lose one specific concept.  It’s easier said than done, and most people don’t have the ability to take this lesson to heart without earning their lumps the hard way – but drop the idea of “equality” and especially that everything needs to be done in tandem. 

Things will never be equal, and trying to force them to be can cause a lot of damage.  Instead of trying to date one person exactly equally (hint: even when it works out and things are incredibly good, “equal” is never a truly accurate description) just…date people.  There’s nothing wrong with dating somebody with a hope that they might also hit it off with your spouse, but trying to force the issue and keep things in tandem is a very difficult job for somebody who has already mastered the skills you have to learn.  It’s not where you want to be your first time at bat.  Instead of trying for the impossible “equal”, instead focus on a much more realistic “good” with an eye always on “even better” for everybody involved. 

I know it seems way scarier to just let your spouse go out there without you, but it really is just an illusion that it will be easier if you can manage to land a unicorn. Learn how to do poly right and a great many wonderful things are possible for you, but you can’t get the answers out of the back of the book – you need to put the time into the homework.  If you want to open your marriage up you need to learn how to be comfortable with your spouse dating somebody else, so…get on that! The other big concept I hope you take away is that regardless of what model you choose for polyamory, the people you’re adding into your lives are not abstractions, they’re people who have needs and feelings that can be hurt.  I hope this post has inspired you to look at trying things differently than a couple of the most common pitfalls new people make.",,False,self,t5_2qu5n,1374267788.0,,,True,t3_1imvod,http://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1imvod/how_to_open_your_marriage_to_a_third/,

He, I'll call him Erik, started dating a new woman 4 months ago, aged 21, and introduced her three weeks ago to all of us ladies. 

After dinner we sat down in the living room and Erik struck up a conversation about the new g/f, saying that she may be moving in soon. Sarah, Alanna, and I didn't know what to think of her, but she made a great first impression on us. He proceded to say that the house was getting a little crowded, and he wanted to downsize. And I was the throwaway. I asked him why he would do this, since I was there from the begining, and I was okay with an open marriage-type living situation. He gave this crappy analogy to trading in his old used car for the newer models, and how it keeps a man happy. The other women in the house were silent. They didn't say anything. They let him say his piece. He told me he had a great time with me while it lasted, but he wanted all of his g/f's to be the similar in the looks department, and he lost interest in me and I should consider myself ""lucky"" he didn't trade me in when he met Alanna (second g/f).

I gasp in wonder, and she talls me this story about how they pick up ocean themed ornaments when they travel. Captured by how lovely this thing is, I instinctively reach for it - and remember at the last minute that I am in my filthy welding gear, and my hands are too dirty to touch the ornament. I  reach back, but too late - she thinks I have a grip on it, releases it, and the ornament and I fall down in a heap. I fall on the floor and it shatters.

She's nice about it, but I can see the smile is edged and the dissapointment in her eyes breaks my heart. 

Boyfriend and I return to my place (split custody, he spends half the week with each of us) and despite his reassurances I know I've Blown It. I decide to replace it, and over the next few weeks, I try - to no avail. It was a limited run, there are no more, only ten were made. I call the shop. I call the vendor. I call the distributor. I scour the intertubes. Nothing. Toy stores, general stores, hobby stores - nothing is right. 

So I decide to make one - but my carving skills and clay skills aren't up to the challenge of an eight-legged beast. I decide to order and paint one - and the first one I get in the mail is the size of a dinner plate, and made of red floppy rubber. This won't do! 

I get another one, and this one is the right size. I drove to four different stores to get the supplies. I carefully do a base coat of iridescent white over the orange plastic- six layers! Then the green, carefully blending to get the ombre effect. I spray it with clear coat, glue on teeny swarovskis I bought at the craft store, put in a tiny gold eyehook, and hang it from green ribbon. I'll give it to her soon. It looks smashing. 

If I had just let it go, it would be fine. I was forgiven. But this memento- this 4$ ornament I paid 50$ to recreate and replace- was a symbol of the Wife and her man's relationship, their weekend together, their past and future, and by extension my respect for those things. Neglecting to replace it by any means possible would be unforgiveable. 

I'm so glad I was able to remake the damn thing. Now I just need to figure out what to do with a floppy red rubber octopus the size of a plate.

Earlier today he said I was acting like a mother sending her son on his first date but he was acting like a 13 year old going on his first date! I'm sitting at home with the kids, dying to know how it went, but out of curiosity I just searched where his iPhone is (he brought it up as a suggestion earlier if I didn't hear from him). He's on his way out of town to an area with lots of secluded beaches so I think I know the answer!

So for those of you with open relationships, how did your first open dates go? How did you feel? How did your partner feel? Anything else I should know or think about that you learned down the road ('if I knew then what I know now' kind of thing)? We are new to the game and I guess I'm both excited and nervous. Excited because I'm actually looking forward to sloppy seconds (originally wasn't sure I'd want to the same night), and nervous because I don't know how this relationship is going to go (meaning his and hers, but by extension his and mine as well). We've gotten A LOT closer since agreeing to open our relationship, but tonight's date is a huge step. I'm not feeling upset or jealous right now, although I expect to feel that at some point. I did find myself getting a little jealous when he'd talk about it this week, but it wasn't anything extreme, he noticed and I explained why and didn't get all that upset.
I don't really know what else to say right now, guess I'm just looking for some friendly advice :)

EDIT: My husband came home, and brought her over to meet me! She was shy, and so was I, and I found out...so was my husband! I gave my hubby crap about being gun shy, but he's just a genuinely nice guy and I think he was just nervous. It sounds like they had a good time, which is good, and he's going to invite her over tomorrow to hang out for a bit. I'll be taking the kids to a movie so they can have some privacy :) After he dropped her off back home, he came back all nervous because he thought he blew it, WAY over analyzed the whole evening, and eventually realized that everything went fine, it's not going to be perfect (this is his first-first date in like 8 years) and it's all good. I'm still reassuring him that everything is ok :) I'll update again tomorrow. This is pretty fun actually, I can't believe we didn't start seeing other people sooner!

1320108099.0,78,self.polyamory,lvuy3,I miss it.  I miss her.  I didn't realize what we had until now.,86,8,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/lvuy3/i_miss_it_i_miss_her_i_didnt_realize_what_we_had/,"My wife and I have a semi-open-ish relationship.  This means that we are free to joke and flirt with anyone we please, but that's as far as it goes without the approval of the other.

About 4 years ago (prior to the semi-open-ish-ness,) I met a wonderful woman strictly by chance.  We were both new in town and going through orientation together at ""The Company.""  We struck it off within minutes of seeing each other, and exchanged phone numbers.  I told my wife about this immediately.  She got a little jealous.

A few weeks later I received a phone call from her, she didn't have enough storage space at her place and wanted to give some things away (pots, pans, knick-knacks and the like.)  So my wife and I went over to pick stuff up.  This was when she and my wife met.  They were friends almost instantly.  My wife asked her why she decided to call me about this and it was simply stated that it was because ""He was the first person that was nice to me when I got here.""  All was accepted.

A few weeks later, she calls again.  ""Can I come over there to cook?  My kitchen sucks.""  So, she comes over and cooks a magnificent meal, and we all dine together.  A couple of weeks later, I called her up, and said ""It's thanksgiving, your family is half a country away, come on over.""  A month after that it was ""Put some pants on, I'm on the way to pick you up.""

Then it became a twice a week thing.  It was to the point that my one year old recognized her and called her ""Aunt."" 

New years came and we all got liquored up and woke up on the folding couch together.  Nothing happened, but it was nice to wake up all together.  Nothing felt awkward or weird about it at all.

We kept hanging out together for a few more months, and finally my wife came to me and asked if it was OK if she put the moves on her.  She wanted to have sex with her.  I told her it was OK, I had known since we met that she was bi, and I told her at that time, that I would never keep her away from a good woman.

So, it happened.  Several times as a matter of fact.  Just the two of them, and I was perfectly OK with it.  I didn't know it at the time, but I was experiencing compersion.  It felt right.

The company decided that I needed to be somewhere else for a year, and that she and my family were staying put.  So I went, it wasn't bad.  I got to call home a few times a week, and she stayed with my wife at least 5 days a week.  There were a couple of months that the only thing they were apart for was work.  They took care of each other.

I came back, and things went back to their previous configuration, except that I was waking up next to both of them.  I never even had sex with her.

Then she was injured.  We helped her get better again.  The company decided that they didn't need her any more, and she ended up moving back to where her family was, where there were jobs-a-plenty.  The day I dropped her off at the airport was one of the saddest days of my life.  I felt like I was losing a part of myself, and a part of my life.

The day after, my wife comes to me crying...  ""I hate this.  I think I fell in love.""  ""I know baby.  Me too.""  We just looked at each other.

Previously, the word ""love"" had never been mentioned by any of us, and none of us had heard of ""polyamory.""

I know now that what we had was special.  We didn't know it at the time, but it was great.

I managed to fall in love with the woman my wife was in love with, and never had sex with her.

I wish I could do it again.  I miss the comfort, the warmth, the caring.  I miss it all.
We talked about it again today.  We miss her.  We know we can't have her back, because if you don't work for the company, there's nothing here for you.

This is why I love polyamory.,92,15,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1hlb03/a_response_to_some_recent_posts_this_is_why_i/,"My girlfriend asked me last week about visiting her friend in NY and I told her I thought it was a great idea. She'll ride up there soon, spend the evening and come home in time for us to see fireworks with friends. She's sent some messages to her lover to make all the arrangements, the plan is set.  

And this, is a story about why I like polyamory.  

When she asked me, I was truly excited for her. I delight in idea that she will get some great attention from her lover, and I enjoy that experiences like these also help to make her feel comfortable when I have an encounter with someone.  

She left today. She was giggly and squirming this morning when I kissed her goodbye. Both of us felt incredibly warm. I love the idea that they'll go out, have dinner, a couple drinks and then go back to his place. He'll spend the evening making her feel special. His pulse will be elevated the whole time, smiling at her, attentively reaching out to her and reinforcing how hot she is. He'll be on his best behavior. Why? Because he knows if he does he'll see her again. His brain will awash in crazy-making molecules and just barely keeping his thoughts together. He knows at the end of the evening they'll ravaging each other, and exploring some pleasurable kink.   

She'll be dressed to the nines and absolutely digging how hot she looks and feels. This guy will be lavishing attention on her, savoring the sensation of ""damn, I still got it"". She will be having fun with flirting, showing this guy a good time for the evening, and she'll also know there's man that loves her that she can come home to, feel sane, safe and secure.  

Sidebar: while writing this she texted me: ""Walking ten blocks to meet up w/him at 5. Baby, I love you so much. You are an incredible man, a good man, a beautiful compassionate , loving man and I am SO happy with you and grateful to be your woman"". I texted her back saying I love her and wished her an awesome time. 

Tomorrow, she'll come home, and we'll both reserve time to 'catch' each other. To lock back in and reinforce how much we love each other. I'll pry and ask her for details, and she'll probably get shy and maybe offer a few highlights. In the past I've brought home flowers, and I told her that this guy sounds great and I really appreciate how he seems like a good choice and that I'm just flat out glad for her. We always end up in bed feeling incredibly turned on and completely ravage each other.  

I dont think it will happen this time but in the past I've even felt a little jealousy or insecure, and there's a way that I like that too. What happens is it feels like a little mini-trial, a short test to get through, but when she's back we feel even tighter for having gone through that trial.  

For me, this is a way to love my girlfriend even more better than I do already. It makes us tighter, we feel more at ease about our lives, our sexuality and our natural impulse to occasionally enjoy being with another person. Poly is a way of showing my love to my partner and to allow our love to grow greater than it is already.

I'm a full-time student and I work full-time, so I haven't really actively searched for anyone. My boyfriend has had a few short flings, mostly old friends from his hometown. 

Opening up the relationship in the first place was my idea, and after a lots and lots of talking, we came up with a plan that worked: he could be with whoever he wants because jealousy isn't something I have a problem with, but I can only be with other girls because he is quite insecure. This was supposed to be temporary, while he tried to work on his feelings of jealousy. In any case, it didn't bother me because part of the reason I wanted to open up was because we are both bisexual and I wanted us both to have an opportunity to explore that, seeing as my boyfriend and I got together at a very young age and all of the exploring that you're supposed to do in college/late high school was cut off for both of us.

But here we are three years later and I still can't see whoever I want. At this point it has more to do with the principle of fairness than anything I actively want to do.

Anyways, I'm always in need of advice/encouragement so maybe it will incite some of that, too. Mostly I'd been meaning to write this down for a while and thought I'd share.)

I was always a poly person. Well, first I was a serial monogamist, but I discovered poly early on, skimmed a couple of books, and thought little more of the topic. But I was cynically poly: It wasn't that I truly thought that polyamory was ideal, it was just that I couldn't conceive that there would be any relationship that could contain all of my desires and aspirations and was skeptical that anyone who believed they had was delusional, at worst, or just plain settling. Being poly was just easier and allowed me to manage my expectations for relationships a little bit: I didn't need ""the one,"" or even the "".99,"" as Dan Savage says, but I could find .95, round up, and meet the rest of my intimate needs and desires with secondary partners and occasional flings. I kissed a lot of frogs along the way and even got engaged and nearly married her just before I met, and started dating, a new partner. And, as you might imagine from the set up, this new girl, she was ""the one."" Well, lets say she was still the "".9995."" We were alike enough to be compatible but different enough to… be compatible. Similar backgrounds, similar politics, she wanted a PhD in Philosophy, I wanted one in Engineering. And she was poly too. 


When we married, our secondary partners flew in to cheer us on. We were out and open and great. At first, there was some jealousy on both of our parts, but each time, it felt like a minor bump along the path. Our secondary partners became fewer and farther between and were mostly out-of-state. Plus we had a kid and careers and were isolated a little geographically while we were in graduate school so we hardly had time for one another. Our polyamory turned more and more monogamish until I looked up one day, seven years into our marriage, and we were practically monogamous. And I liked it. I liked it a lot. And when my wife told me that she had a date coming up, I quietly freaked out. And when they fucked, I not-so-quietly lost it. I felt betrayed, though I knew intellectually that there'd been no betrayal. My wife had always been up front about being poly but, though we often discussed rules and boundaries, we somehow never really discussed in depth *why* we were poly. And there was a world of difference between us on that point.

My problem was that I'd thought my wife was cynically poly like me, that on some level, she was poly because the right thing hadn't arrived, because she knew, like I did, that right thing couldn't arrive, that the idea that the right thing could arrive was a myth. I knew that she was the right thing for me. It's not that other women didn't intrigue me or turn me on, but a part of me felt good and purposeful that there would be nobody else for me.  And I could still flirt and have strictly platonic friendships with those other women.


Well, my wife never saw it that way. At all. She was as committed to me as ever, but polyamory *was* her ideal. She loved me, in part, *because* we weren't weren't attached to controlling one another's intimate lives. She found something deeper and more profound, and no less romantic, in her vision of polyamory (which she'd thought I'd subscribed to as well). Likewise, she saw something cheap, patriarchal, and limiting about the monogamy I wanted.


We fought for a while. At first, we stayed open. I had a few fun flings,  but mostly I seethed in resentment. My resentment wore off and divorce was on the table when she said ""fine, lets try it your way"" and it was her turn to be resentful. We talked about a variety of compromises that, in hindsight, seem totally unreasonable (we actually seriously discussed alternating poly/monogamous by the year!) and made us more committed to our irreconcilable positions. It became a virus that infected every little thing about our relationship. Divorce was on the table again, and this time, it seemed final. Neither of us even seemed devastated, but we thought about the kid and decided to try on our marriage one last time. 


We talked to a marriage counselor. The counselor was, not surprisingly, not incredibly poly-friendly, but she did help us to stop talking past one another. Through her, we got to a really refreshing conversation about compromises... and we discovered that compromise wouldn't work. My wife was willing to listen to me, willing to support me, willing to even sacrifice polyamory for me, but unwilling to change her beliefs. She's a philosopher, she found a philosophy in polyamory that she *believed* in. She was willing to hear the other side but she would always disagree (unless she encountered some great argument that I'm not inclined to make). 
But, me, I'm a scientist. I have beliefs, sure, but if I have an operating philosophy it's that I think of myself as a more utilitarian: I do what benefits the most people. I do what **works**. So, I realized, if compromise wouldn't work, the only thing that *would* work would be to either change my premises or for us to get divorced. 


So I tried to change my premises and go back to square one on polyamory. I mean, blank slate. This time I *read* all the books, my wife did too. We found that we agreed and disagreed on a lot of the same things in the books. The new edition of *The Ethical Slut* is far better than the one I encountered as a teen. *Sex At Dawn* spoke to my scientist's sensibilities, even when I disagreed. That *worked* some. Also /r/polyamory helped (thanks guys!). But what worked most of all is that we ended the adversarial air that came to define our marriage. Oh, and I got a girlfriend -- a happily married, polyamorous engineer who uses engineering metaphors to explain her polyamory that sense to me in a way that my wife's Jacques Lacan quotations don't. That definitely helped. And wife has been the best listener and confidant and the best book group I could imagine. And, after a hard spell, it's actually been a lot of fun. Did you hear me? A LOT OF FUN! I still can't say that I'm poly by any particular principle other than ""do what works for what matters"" but that's a disagreement I'm happy to keep. 


So here I am, fifteen months later and, once again, happily, happily, happily married. And even happily poly. She feels like ""we're back,"" I feel like we're something better than back. We're whole again. 
Thanks for reading.

The other day, there was a comment thread where this man had sex with hundreds of prostitutes. Ordinarily that's fine, whatever floats your boat...but he actually described some situations that were obviously exploitative (For example, one starts crying. He waits till she stops then continues having sex). He said he was addicted, and didn't know what he would do when he got into a ""real"" relationship. Someone suggested polyamory, which ticked me off a bit. That's when I started noticing...this happens constantly, not just in r/sex and r/relationships, but in real life situations. 

A person cheats...someone suggest polyamory. A marriage is sexually or emotionally unfulfilling...someone suggests polyamory. 

Personally, I don't think polyamory is a viable alternative for people who fail at monogamy, or at communication, for that matter. Someone who cheats clearly does not understand trust and communication. Why are people so quick to recommend polyamory to individuals who experience failure in monogamous relationships due to poor communication skills, empathy, and trustworthiness?

This is not to say that anyone who has ever cheated is incapable of polyamory, we know that isn't true. People grow. But still...polyamory really shouldn't be the knee-jerk advice to give when someone cheats or feels unsatisfied, should it?

They've gotten better and more accepting over to the years, to the point where I think I could come out to them as bisexual without being disowned. 

But the thought of coming out as poly to them? Oh god no.

On the other hand, most of our mutual friends have known we were all dating and poly for as long as I've known them. Some of them are non-monogamous too. It's great. And a few months ago my asshole debate coach basically forced me to out myself to the team, which went surprisingly well even if the circumstances sucked. And now I'm slowly bringing my debate partners and my romantic partners together. And all my friends in the local kink community know and are very supportive.

So perhaps being accepted shouldn't be that surprising. But my parents basically taught me to hide myself and I suppose I just expect all other families to be the same, even though I *know* how stupid it is to extrapolate from one data point.

When we got to her mother's house today and I was greeted with hugs and smiles and an excited golden retriever, it still surprised me, even though they always treat me like this. I'm getting over my gut reaction to hide affection from them and realizing that her younger sister won't be traumatized by seeing a cuddle-puddle.

Some background:  I'm a straight male, and work for a living.  One day while I was going home form work, a coworker who I'd had moderate interactions with asked me if I smoked dope.  I told him I did, and he suggested that I go with him and his girlfriend back to his place and get high.  I did, we got high and then we played some chess.  I liked it a lot, and suggested I return soon.  

I started going over there more and more often, and the three of us kept hanging out, chilling and getting high.  We started walking each night up a local hill that over looked the whole town, where the three of us would share a joint and talk about mankind, the point of life, and other shit you want to talk about while stoned and looking over a town.  I started get to get quite close to both of them.  This kept going for about two months until Thanksgiving break.

During break he let me know that his girlfriend (my friend at this point) had posted on GW.  I was confused and stupidly suspected nothing of it.  After we got back, we did our standard walk, where she let me know that she wanted me to see the pics on GW.  At this point I was still blind, but happy to talk about it with her.  When we got home after the walk I finally pieced it together that she wanted to have sex with me.  I said I was uncomfortable with a threesome, so me and her went upstairs and had AMAZING sex.  I wont go into specifics, but damn was it good.  We spent the next three weeks fucking like rabbits, and I eventually was ok with having a threesome, so the sex started getting better.  She posted one of our escapades on GW, and mentioned we are three.  One of the commentors posted a link to r/poly.  This was the first time I had heard of polyamory outside of cult polygamy.

At this point I was a FWB.  We talked about having feelings for each other, but we talked about it like it was wrong, or immoral.  Then came Xmas break (which I'm still on) and our vacations meant we wouldn't see each other for nearly 6 weeks.  I'm about a week into it so far and it sucks.

The amazing news though, is that I finally found an internet connection, and I got to chat with them both for the first time in several days.  We started talking about how great the sex was, and how much we miss each other.  With some awkward conversation dancing I mentioned r/poly.  This spurred us into our first three-way conversation about us.

She was very nervous (as always) about such a different situation.  But the more we talked the more we realized that just because we were calling it FWB didn't make it so.  The three of us had feelings for each other.  So we decided that we want to take it seriously, and start dating.  This means I will be getting more alone time with her, and him and I be more open with each other about our feelings.

I just wanted to post here and thank r/poly for showing us that our feelings are not only normal, but sustainable.  Now I'm in an amazing relationship with my two best friends.",,False,self,t5_2qu5n,True,,,True,t3_nmq9p,http://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/nmq9p/they_said_yes/,

In my last post about this situation, everyone suggested I actually meet her and get to know her better. So one night, I finally went to my boyfriend and said, ""...can we three all get together for dinner?""

About a week ago, we all met at my boyfriend's place, and she made us dinner. It didn't start off too well (she basically ignored me when she first walked in and talked to my boyfriend like I wasn't even there), but as the evening went on, we all started to loosen up.

And you know what was really nice? At one point, we all ended up cuddling in my boyfriend's bed together, with me in the middle. She and I even ended up kissing a few times. That was so nice. That was *so nice.*

But my super over-analytical brain then spent the next few days *convincing* me that I didn't actually like it. No, I was just playing along because it made my boyfriend happy. Going through the motions. Doing it out of obligation.

So I invited her over for dinner tonight. Because I had to know, I had to know if I was doing this for my boyfriend, or if I was doing this because I genuinely liked her. And the second she walked into my apartment, we were talk talk talking. And it wasn't even superficial shit, we got into talking about past relationships, our insecurities, we giggled and gushed about our boyfriend, and we ended up cuddling and kissing in my bed together for a good long while.

And...I just feel...I just feel so...oh my god. I feel like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders. So much of my anxiety about my relationship with my boyfriend is fucking *gone.* There really are no words to describe how *relieved* I feel at this moment. There's still a part of me that's really fucking terrified (because oh my god I don't know what I'm doing and I'm still kind of scared that my boyfriend is going to leave me and this is the first time I've kissed a woman and liked it and whaaaaat I thought I was straighter than straight -- but that's another post for another subreddit), but...

Just...

I am so relieved right now I almost want to cry.

I had gone to the party with my primary, and everyone knew we were there as an engaged couple, so when I talked with this girl, even though she appeared interested, she tried to limit our conversation as to not make my primary jealous. Seeing this, my primary went over to talk to her, tell her that I liked her, briefly explained everything, and said she fully supported my interest in her, and proceeded to make sure I asked for her number before I left. At no point had I talked to my primary about doing this, she 100 percent took the initiative to help me find someone to stop playing monopoly.

Its a scary thing for him to say ""I love you"", it really is, but somehow, him coming to me as a friend took the jealous feelings I've had away, and as his friend and as someone who loves him, I was able to be true to myself and tell him to say it.  I have always felt that its better to say you love someone, if you do, scary or not, then to just keep it to yourself.

Ok, so I'll try not to ramble, as it can be a habit of mine (though it's probably inevitable). lol I just wanted to say this directly to you, in writing, because things don't always come out of my mouth exactly as I mean them to and then it just get's even more weird. lol

Even though I've only gotten to hang out with you for a short amount of time so far, I think you are a pretty awesome person :) I know I probably come off as rather awkward and quiet, but that's just the way I am with anyone new, being the introvert that I am.

Also, since I've never really been in this kind of arrangement before, I must admit that I don't quite know how to act when we're all together. There are obvious things that aren't appropriate, but then there's a lot of grey area, which also doesn't help my awkwardness. lol I've just been taking cues from Lostcheshire at this point, but I want to be as respectful to you and your feelings as best as I can. So please let me know if I ever do anything that you're not ok with. I won't be offended in the least.

That being said, I wanted to thank you for sharing Lostcheshire. I hope that doesn't sound awkward and weird but it's the best way I can think of to put it. Lostcheshire is wonderful (as I'm sure you know since you married him and all) and I'm just so happy that the opportunity to get to know him presented itself when it did. And without you, that wouldn't have been possible, so thank you, thank you, thank you! You are absolutely fantastic! (and please feel free to read that last sentence in the 9th Doctor's voice) ^.^

So, after that long, ridiculous letter, I want to say that I really like Lostcheshire. I think you're cool. I hope we can become friends. And if you have any questions or worries or just plain want to chat, let me know. I'm an open book, I'm a fantastic listener, and I enjoy getting to know new people, despite what my introverted tendencies might suggest.

Sooooo yeah, lol. Hope you're having a good evening. :)

P.S.-You two are so damn adorable/awesome together! Just thought you should know.



From: TJ@Loveofmy.wife
To: KD@New.Girlfriend

Though most folks don't believe this, I am also an introvert. A super socialy comfortable one, but an introvert none the less. Whereas Lostcheshire is a socially anxious extrovert. We're such weirdos. ;)
I think you're great, and it's been lovely to be able to spend time with you. As we get to spend more time things will get more comfortable. I felt absolutely neurotic before my boyfriend ""CF"" came out to visit in June. My brain went haywire wondering how I should act, and what would be ok. Would it be ok to kiss either one of them if they were both in the same room? Cuddle? Hold hands? OHMYGODWHEREWILLWESLEEP? 
HOW DO I NORMALLY STAND? 
HOW DO HANDS WORK??!?!?
So yeah. I get that. Don't worry about it. The very best things are honesty and communication. They build trust and respect and comfort. Those are the things that allow Lostcheshire and I to hold and protect each others hearts, while leaving room for growth and any other positive feelings that may come around. I've found that those sorts of things can feel risky to start. There's a lack of honest communication in the world, which is sad, becasue so much good can come out of it. I have learned a lot about myself through the conversations that I have had with both Lostcheshire and CF. We are all open books. That's how it is, so I promise you that if I get uncomfortable about anything we'll talk about it. And we'll talk about it calmy and without accusations. **It will be super adult and kind of dull, and it will work miracles.** That being said, I would ask that you do the same for me, ok? I am so glad that you messaged me, honey. This is wonderful.

Lostcheshire is amazing, and I am reminded every day how very lucky I am to have found him. I can see clearly that you make him happy, too. So thank you for that. It's wonderful to see, and it makes me very happy.

TL;DR- You should really read it.  Somewhere between the mushy stuff is a worthwhile lesson in communication.

1346190377.0,72,self.polyamory,yzg5c,What's a monogamous husband to do with a suddenly-poly wife who is only interested in other women?,87,15,62,http://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/yzg5c/whats_a_monogamous_husband_to_do_with_a/,"28M here, married to my [29F] wife for 4 years, after dating and being engaged for three years before (so seven years total).  This is my first time so much as visiting /r/polyamory, so please forgive me if I don't know all the right terms.

Last Friday, my wife told me she is no longer attracted to me, or men in general, but she wants the marriage to stay together, but she also wants my permission to have sex with other women.  She confessed to flirting with one other woman at the Y and that they fondled each other's boobs in the showers, but said they went no further than that.  This attraction and groping came out of nowhere, she says.

In the spirit of full disclosure, let me just state right now that I am *extremely* squicked by polyamory and I *know* I cannot handle the stress and baggage of a poly marriage, so you may as well all downvote me to the stone age right away.  I have no interest in polyamory, and less than zero interest in fucking anyone other than my wife.  At the same time, though, if this is what she really needs, then maybe I should let her sleep around, even if we have to get separated or divorced later.

So on Saturday we made an appointment with a marriage counsellor, and I agreed that she could call this woman from the Y to set up a date.  I was a *lot* less than enthusiastic (okay, I was still in shock, probably), but I still have to admit I said yes and told her to go for it.

Which she did.

The very same day.

And she spent the night.

I didn't even know she had the Y woman's phone number, but she did, and off she went while I was doing the laundry (I find a dull, repetitious task sometimes helps me cope with big revelations like, y'know, this).  She even called me, panting in that ""I just had the most amazing sex ever!"" way, to tell me she wouldn't be home for dinner, and I could hear the other woman giggling next to (behind? on top of? underneath? wrapped around?) her, and my wife said, ""gottagoloveyoubye"" and hung up as they went on to round 2 or 3 or fuck if I know how many rounds it was.

My wife came home around 1:00 pm Sunday.  She came onto me and it looked like things were about to get hot and bothered, but she kept whispering into my ear how hot it was having sex with women, how glad she was that she could experience everything I had about women now, etc.  killed my erection stone-dead and left me unable to maintain another one.  I offered to get her off some other way, but she declined and said ""You suck."" (In fairness, I think she was joking with ""you suck,"" she's done it before, but it didn't make me feel any better this time.)

So, /r/polyamory, what is a disposable spouse to do when they find themselves a third wheel in their own marriage?  Is it possible to be monogamous when your spouse isn't?  Is it worth it?

Thanks in advance.

She already knew that my husband and I live an alternate lifestyle and although she says she doesn't completely understand it, she wants me/us to be happy. 

   We had a long discussion about people and relationships and a previous relationship that I had with a mono guy that I fell for almost 2 years ago. Which she knew about but didn't approve of because 1)Her father (my husband) didn't approve of the relationship. And 2) His motives were actually to 'steal me away' from my husband. 
 
 She also asked me if I thought my boyfriend would want to meet all of them, (her, her husband, my other daughter and her family). I told her, I had never specifically asked him that but I can't see why not.

  Now I just need to figure out how to tell her sister. Ideally, I would have liked to have shared the news with them at the same time but due to time factors and distance, that wouldn't have been possible for a while.

   All in all, it was a great talk and I'm so happy that we can now share this part of our lives with her.

When we first started dating back in 2009 Primary was exclusive and strictly monogamous. I explained to him that I'm a free love kinda guy and would like to branch out and try things. Naturally Primary was not very pleased with this but we talked about it. I agreed to reign in my horses and he agreed to open up a little when he's ready.

So a year goes by and we look like any other mono couple, and I reminded him of my desire to try different things with him. Our first experiment was a threesome of someone of his choosing. We had a good time and it was just casual fun. Primary found he quite enjoys the kinkier side of sex so we've had numerous threesomes and foursomes.

Then he goes to visit family but along the way meets a friend from the Internet and they wanted to play. I told him it was fine because I really am not worried about him leaving me for a fling. He had fun on his own and realised that I could do the same and still love him. Next thing I know I have full permission to play with whomever I want and whenever I want, but as long as it's only play.

Now a few weekends ago he goes to visit family again in the neighbouring city and finds another hookup for the weekend, but this time something amazing happened. Primary developed a crush on this guy. And this guy reciprocated. They're constantly chatting and being cute.  
And Primary and I are still going very strong.

Primary told me that he learnt that he can have feelings for someone without diminishing the feelings for another. I'm so happy for him.

Now Primary's crush is coming to visit us for the weekend of the 22nd. Crush is really nervous and has no idea what to make of me because he's never encountered polyamory before, but we've been chatting and I'm hoping we'll at least be friends. Hoping for more but I'll take what I can get.

Today I told Primary he should send a Valentines message to Crush, because it would be the cutest thing ever. :3 (Dunno if he'll do it. No pressure.)

**tl;dr** Primary, who started mono, now has a crush. I'm super excited!

Just a small update for Valentines Day. Primary asked Crush to be his Valentine. Crush said yes. Then they discussed what that actually entailed. They settled on boning and had a laugh.

I have explained to my mother but she refuses to talk to me to and says that I'm such a bad person. I never done illegal drugs, I don't smoke, and I rarely drink. I even volunteer from time to time. It's just so frustrating! Why is it so wrong to love more than one person at a time? I understand the norms of our society and their views against non-monogamous relationships. I usually keep to myself and I am pretty much an introvert so I have never dealt with people attacking me personally for my beliefs. I guess my question is, how do you all deal with it?

I appreciate everyone who took the time to comment with input. My head is a little clearer now. Sorry for the panic, /r/polyamory.

-------------------
A little backstory: My fiance' and I have been poly since the very beginning of our relationship. After a year or so of dating we moved in together and became active in our local kink community. At one of the munches we met with my girlfriend and her husband. They were somewhat new to practicing the BDSM lifestyle. He was the Dom, she was the sub. Through a big complicated mess, he decided he was no longer interested in being her dominant and so I became her primary top.

The male half of this relationship, who we'll call D, has struggled a lot with trying too hard to please his wife (who we'll call S.) S grew up in an abusive situation and was trying to create that within the BDSM dynamic, and D- having pursued S for years, wanted to keep her around and so became the UBER DOM.

So, recently he decides he isn't into the Dominance thing anymore. He's into Primal Play and things like that.

Here's where the issue comes in.

Today, while they were over, he says: ""I've been paying more attention to my instincts. Like last night, I was kind of wanting sex but she was tired and not wanting it. But I payed attention to my instincts and went over to her and mounted her and really gave it to her.""

Throughout the course of their relationship I suspected he was forcing her to do a lot of things she didn't like to do and was not consenting to. I know with the nature of BDSM, things get a little tricky. Earlier in the day he told me to do something that would cause her pain and I asked her if she liked it and wanted it, she said no. He told me to do it anyway, it would turn her on. I asked her if it turned her on. She said no. He insisted it did anyway.

He has also come out with such gems as ""Oh, you're introverted? I'll break you of that."" said to me. Even though I am not his partner or his submissive. He also does not ask to come over, or ask me to come over, but tells me when he will be doing so and assumes everyone is okay with it. We've asked him not to do that. He does it anyway.

Eep, sorry, getting a little ranty about him. It's not that I don't like him, but...I'm concerned for her. He rubs me the wrong way and she seems to be really not that into what he wants.

So, throughout the short span of our relationship, I have checked in with her at every turn. Lots of ""Do you like this?"" ""Is this good for you?"" ""How do YOU feel?"" To make sure she's okay.

So, he says he mounted her even though she said no. Her head was in my lap while he was speaking and I looked down and said ""And did YOU enjoy that?""

During the whole discussion she had been having a hard time talking about how she honestly felt with him. She struggled with each answer when gently asked if she was okay with what he was suggesting I do to her. Then, when I asked her the above question, she looked up at me and gave me this..look.

I can't describe it. I just knew that I shouldn't push her any more on it in front of him. I don't want to assume she was in a rape-feeling situation based on a look, but that look felt like something. That look was ""I am not comfortable answering this right now. Please don't make me answer this.""

I asked her, several times, if she was happy, if she loved him, if she was comfortable, and she answered yes. But what he said, and the way she looked at that moment..I'm very, very concerned for her. I didn't tell him it was wrong, which I feel horrible about. She's probably at home right now going through something similar. I think I was scared if I had said something I would have driven him to telling her she should end our relationship and that would have put her in an unsafe situation with no lifelines.

My fiance' is currently at work. I've texted him a couple times. I want to call him, but I don't want to get him in trouble. He should be home soon anyway.

I want to suggest she stay with us for a few days, but I have no way to transport her to college and her place of employment and so she will probably decline.

I feel very much at a loss of what to do here. He reads all of her messages so I can't message her and he always comes over with her so it's very hard to get her alone. If I can manage to arrange it it will probably be a few weeks before that happens. I'm going to try to see if I can figure out something for tomorrow but I don't know how well it will work. I'm also supposed to visit their home on the 9th but I really do not trust him at the moment and really do not want to be around him alone.

Still struggling, but I came out pretty well.",82,15,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/15miep/had_a_kinda_rough_night_still_struggling_but_i/,"My wife and I are pretty new to the whole poly world. We've been together for 4 years and married for one. Because of our schedules, my wife and her BF often get to spend time together while I'm at work. They have been friends for years, and he has been my best friend for a long time, and it never bothered me when they hung out. Once she started dating him, I started resenting that I have to be at work and they get to have fun. I really quickly realised that it has more to do with the fact that I wish I could be having fun and not stuck at work than anything else, and I really haven't had jealous feelings for a while.

I have, for the past couple weeks, been feeling less sexy. When I've made any sexual moves, I've gotten turned down more often than not. At the same time, whenever they hang out together, they have fooled around and she's really enjoyed it. I've told my wife how I've been feeling, and that I'm grappling with it. There's no clear answer, but we're working on it, and 

So cue last night. Last night was the first time they went out with the intent of having sex. They spent all day together, I got to see her for 2 hours while she got ready to go out. I was pissy, bitchy, and just generally in a bad mood.  And then, when she left, I was alone. As I'm sure many here have experienced, the first time your SO leaves to have sex with someone, it's a big feeling. We've had threesomes before, and we have talked about them having sex for a while, but to have it actually happen: to be at home while your wife is going out to have sex with somebody who isn't you, that's what got me pushed into a very contemplative space.

So I asked myself some questions.

Q: Why am I OK with this?  
A: Because it makes her happy, you find it sexy, and it doesn't actually affect her love for you.  
Q: Then why am I feeling so shitty?  
A: Because you don't get to be there  
Q: But you still don't really feel sexy, what if she stops caring about you?  
A: That's the stupidest question I've ever heard.  
Q: So why don't you feel sexy?  

This was sort of the watershed moment for me. I don't feel sexy lately because of me. Sure, getting turned down for sex doesn't help, but work has been stressing me out, we're trying to buy a new house and my wife's car just broke down, the girl I'd like to date hasn't responded to a couple date ideas (and may simply not be interested), and the girl I used to fool around with started dating someone and I told her she needed to put us on hold as a result.

So I realized several things. I have been using sex as a proxy for feeling sexy and good about myself. While I still am a little jealous of all the time they get to spend together, it is ~~probably~~ normal for me to not be there the first time my wife has sex with her boyfriend. While I'd love to make love to my wife, our timing has just been off for a couple days, and that's not something to worry about. I just had this moment of clarity that made me happy. I texted my wife and apologized for being off earlier and told her to have a great time.

So I walked out of a sports bar with chicken wings in tow and a big smile on my face, went home, watched some football, hung out with a good friend who's in town, and got to bed at a reasonable hour. While there's obviously still some stuff that I have to deal with (with me and probably with the whole group), I feel a lot better about where I am than I did 24 hours ago.

I know this has been long and rambling, but I wanted to get this all written down some place. 

--------
UPDATE: When my wife got home, it was just wonderful. We talked about everything: my insecurities, how they affected her and made her simultaneously not want to go on her date and also want to go on the date so she could get away from Mopey McSadface, how the evening went, how the sex went, everything. And it was great. Thanks for all the support, everyone. I'm sure this won't be the last time I struggle or don't feel great about everything in the entire universe, and it's good to know that there are supportive people here.",,False,self,t5_2qu5n,1356817614.0,,,True,t3_15miep,http://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/15miep/had_a_kinda_rough_night_still_struggling_but_i/,

We threw a big Thanksgiving party today, and many friends were in attendance. Flirting and drinking in copious amounts. I cooked one hell of a turkey (shit was falling off the BONE, yo), and a pork roast, and there were side dishes from hell to breakfast. Possibly not an analogy, as our fridge is now stuffed with food. Everyone gorged, and then partied late into the night. Watched some movies, had some great convos, and threw everyone out at 1 am. Then, for the first time, the four of US got in bed together.

I am... fucking shellshocked with how awesome that was.

At one point, on the mattress, my wife was lying on her side, and Kell was too, facing each other. They clutched, kissed, and pawed at each other as her BF fucked my wife from behind, and I fucked Kell. I have never before experienced so much simultaneous orgasm in one bed, and goddamn, I've been in a few orgies. My knees are STILL weak right now. I'm about to go cuddle Kell in a separate bed because I have to get up early for work, but tonight...

Tonight was a memory that will live with me until I die. Four people who have utter love and trust, banging each other into oblivion.

**Some background:** He is 31, I am 27, dating for 5 years. Both educated professionals, living in a major city, making good money and not responsible to anyone but ourselves. We live separately - he has a very nice, large downtown apartment that could easily accommodate both of us, but has resisted move-in talks. I live with 2 roommates.

We opened our relationship 2 years ago after many months of talking and fantasizing.

**Our poly experience:** As soon as we opened up our relationship, I was getting a LOT of attention from other men. I dated several men casually, then found 2 steady FWB situations and ""settled"". I still occasionally allow myself to get picked up by a very attractive stranger, but 90% of my romance is with my boyfriend and my two ""lovers"".

My boyfriend's luck was different. I think he's very attractive and charming, if a little nerdy. He went on a dozen or so dates in our first year, but as soon as he mentioned that he had a steady girlfriend and that he was poly (usually on about date 2), the women bolted. After 11 months of poly with him not having had sex with anyone besides me, it was clear that there was a lot of frustration and resentment building up, and it was hurting our relationship.

I suggested that we stop being open for a while, and he agreed. 2 months later, I realized that the experience had opened up something in me, and I couldn't really go back to monogamy. I told him that and though he hid it well, I knew it caused him a lot of pain (though I don't know the precise cause of it, because he has always said he wants to be open). He agreed to give opening up another whirl. I went back to my steady lovers and he continued to have failed dates.

Then about 6 months ago, he had sex with another woman for the first time since we started. They dated for 3 weeks and broke it off, and I never met her at all. After that episode, he quickly slept with 3 more women in the next month. I was happy for him, but I knew something was fishy, and I asked him what had changed. He said that he had been reading dating advice from the web and reddit, and it was helping. I took him at his word and let it pass, though I had an uncomfortable feeling about it. I was also generally uncomfortable with how many women he suddenly seemed be having ongoing sexual relationships with, but I didn't want to steal his moment in the sun.

A month ago, my boyfriend, a woman he had been sleeping with for a week, one of my FWBs and myself were having dinner. As the woman and I were casually chatting in the kitchen, it quickly became apparent that she had no idea the guy she was with was already in a committed relationship. She was talking about what a catch he was, and how she can't believe a guy like him is single in this city.

Later that night, I confronted my boyfriend, and he admitted what he had been up to. He had come to the conclusion that women would only sleep with him if they saw a potential future in terms of traditional marriage. He seems to think that his brand of attractiveness - successful, educated, ""soft"" - only work on women that are ready to settle down. And after honesty about his true situation didn't work for him for over a year, he'd decided that not being upfront about his status is the way to go. He's leading these women on, none of whom appear to be the slightest bit poly-minded, with a vague mirage of being a good, normal man who is looking for the right girl to settle down with.

This is something that deeply offends me. For one thing, I think it is plain wrong to lie and hurt these women, and a missing out on some sex is a small price to pay for being a good human being. For another, I  fear the possibility that he is going to start believing his version of reality - with each woman, he seems to be trying out back-up plans to our relationship, and if the right woman comes along, I get the feeling that he will eject out of our relationship into her arms.

I want him to stop doing this, or stop being open altogether. But after the resentment he built towards me because of our different success rates, I don't know if that conversation is going to end with us still being together, which I very definitely want. Is it fair to ask him to be honest to the women he sees, even if it means he will get a lot less (perhaps no) sex with women he finds attractive?

Here's the feedback I left them.,82,13,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/13rkv4/remember_that_research_survey_on_nonmonogamy_that/,"In case you missed it, here's the survey:

https://kansasedu.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=SV_5nAOyRvVy52EBhj

Here's what I wrote in the box for feedback at the end.

-----

I think significant portions of this survey were very poorly designed or worded, in general because it seems like this survey was designed with some underlying assumptions that completely don't fit my life, views, or practices.  Since I know a good number of other people whose views or practices are similar to mine, I think you're editing us entirely out of the field of your survey; there's no way we can get across through answering these questions.

You narrowly focused on well-defined formal relationships with specific start dates and durations, while my polyamory is about a blurring of distinctions between friends, lovers, and partners, and a social network of involvements in which the state of these connections can sometimes be formalized but in many other cases is nebulous and fluctuates over time.  If you were to substitute ""friend"" for ""partner"" in some of your questions you might begin to see how many of them seem to me.  ""Exactly how many friendships are you in at this moment?""  ""Okay, now pick one of those friends: exactly how many months since this friendship began?""  ""How well has it met your initial expectations?""

Some specific examples of problematic questions (some of which relate to my general complaint above, and some of which are just individual questions I saw a problem with):

1\. ""Please indicate whether you consider [X] to be a primary partner.""
Only two answers were available, and I had to pick one.  One was that she is my primary partner, which is definitely not the case, so I had to pick that I consider her ""my partner"" but not primary.  Umm, ""my partner?""  No.  Maybe if you said ""a partner"" that would be accurate, though on the edge.

2\. ""how long have you been questioning whether monogamy is right?""

You presume that I'm questioning.  I'm not questioning.  Also, what do you mean by ""is right""?  If you mean ""is right for me"", then I never thought it was.  If you mean ""is right"" morally or in some general sense, you'll have to explain further.  Either this question is too vague to answer, or it is not applicable.

3\. ""How long have you been dating ZA?""  Should I say 5 years to begin with what in hindsight was our first date?  But what about the year when we had no contact at all?  Or the almost-year when she was monogamous with someone else and we saw each other frequently and our friendship continued intensifying but we couldn't even kiss?  Or the fact that our non-dating involvement in the past two years has had a very very different quality from the previous 3 years?  And keep in mind that almost-year of her monogamy with someone else was in these past two years.  No answer to that question would be true; the question itself assumes a false premise.

4\. ""Who do you think is more naturally inclined (such as biologically wired or has a genetic predisposition)  to engage in consensual non-monogamy"" men or women?

You require that I pick an answer somewhere on a continuum between men and women; the middle answer was 50/50.  What if my actual answer is that I am confident that we do not know whether men or women have a genetic predisposition for this, or neither?  The 50/50 that you made me pick is a lie.  I don't believe it's 50/50 any more than I believe it's more men or more women; I believe we do not know.

5\. ""We would like to know if you have ever seen a therapist, clinician, or counselor, and if so, in what capacity.  Please describe your prior experience with therapy.""

Because the first choice was ""I have never sought counseling or psychotherapy"" I assume you are limiting this question to my adult life, so I picked that answer.  However, your question was ambiguous.  My parents did have me see a therapist during part of my childhood, but obviously it wasn't me who ""sought counseling"" (nor did I object).


Edit: Oops, initially I copy &amp; pasted to here, forgetting that reddit's markdown eats numbers preceding paragraphs and turns the into numbered lists, so each time I included a blank line in an item, it started my numbering at 1 again.  Sorry!  Fixed with some backslashes now.

---

Edit 2: Something I left in comments on an earlier question rather than in my final feedback, that I think matters too: they defined ""non-monogamous"" very broadly, but then narrowly defined polyamory as a small subset of it.  Their definition of polyamory requires, among other things, that you be in more than one romantic relationship.  That implies that if you're in a committed relationship and also have a regular but casual non-romantic friend with benefits, what you're doing isn't poly.  It implies that if you're in two poly relationships and one of those breaks up, your other relationship just ceased to be poly.  Quite absurd.  I don't know if they meant it that way but I called them on it.  ""Polyamory"" is more or less synonymous with what they define as ""non-monogamy"", and it bugs me when people try to narrow it down and point at some non-monogamous relationship practice and say ""that's not poly!"".

It hurts, though, that my happiness has to come with some sadness. Most of my friends and strangers that I've ""come out"" to have been pretty judgemental. I had a guy at a bar go on a huge diatribe about how I don't actually love him and that when I do find someone I love, I won't want them to go on dates with other people. I tried to explain to him that I want him to go on dates because I DO love him. I just feel like everyone is so unique and has so much to offer. Because I love him and want him to grow and experience, I want him to be able to have those interactions and form those bonds with people.

Up until that point, I hadn't even been thinking about love in terms of who I or anyone else in our quad loved more or less.  I love my husband and my boyfriend differently, and it's hard for me to compare the feelings, not that I even want to.

My husband hasn't said anything since then about his feelings for her being stronger, but it looks to me like they are.  I can tell that he loves her even more than he did two months ago when he told me he thought he loved her more, and it's starting to make my heart hurt.  He isn't neglecting me or our relationship.  He's the same awesome husband he has always been, but I want to be the person he loves more than anyone in the world.  I feel silly even typing that because, like I said, I don't even believe in quantifying love.  

Any words of wisdom?  How can I look at this differently?  Should I tell my husband how I'm feeling?  He felt really guilty when he told me about these feelings two months ago, and he has told me several times since then that he really appreciates how I responded to that.  I don't want him to feel guilty about his feelings. 

Tldr; My husband loves his girlfriend more than he loves me, and it's making my heart hurt.

I was on a second date and it was going pretty well. Somehow we started talking about relationships. I guess she was testing the water.

That was a landmine on a seemingly flawless date.

She didn't know what polyamory is and when I told her the definition and that I think people should do whatever the fuck they want to if it makes them happy, and I don't find it wrong - she was looking at me as if I was telling her about how it's okay for Hitler to have sex with animals. I reassured her I'm not into it bu the date was very weird afterwards, as if she'd lost all respect for me as a viable man for anything. Afterwards she didn't answer a text and a call so I gave it up.

I know some would say that her reaction should have showed me she's a cunt and I shouldn't care.. but I'm not even slightly into polyamory and this happened to me. We could have at least had some great couple of weeks, or even something more. I will never know.

One important factor in our life is that we love sleeping together, but it seems like there's always some challenge when three people share a bed nightly.  

This all started on a queen sized mattress which quickly got crowded when our dogs and cats joined us.  We upgraded to a king size which helped greatly with the available space.  This is a simple and obvious fix - the 16"" difference doesn't sound like much, but it has made a huge impact in our nightly sleep and was worth the price.

The next issue was blanket allocation.  The person in the middle would often get uncomfortably warm, so we moved towards using two blankets - one for each person on either side, and the middle could then use both or either or none as temperatures required.

Finally, there's the issue of ""the middle"".  We've each found that being in the middle can be uncomfortably warm and restricted in movement depending on what either person on the side is doing at the moment.  One of the girls likes to spread out a little, but if both sides decide to do so in the middle of the night, the middle person gets stuck with very little room to move without disrupting those on the sides.

Background: Mid 20's female and have been with my boyfriend of the same age have been together for around 3 years. Earlier this year, we opened up our relationship for a few months, after he expressed an interest in sleeping with more women. We hit the normal stumbling blocks (poor communication, unequal ease in finding dates) and it caused a lot of tension. For me, the whole experience was enlightening, freeing, and surprisingly natural. For the few dates he was able to get, I was overjoyed for him. I found that I really identified with the poly lifestyle and after a lot of introspection, I can see evidence to having always been poly. In stark contrast, the whole ordeal was incredibly draining on him emotionally. He couldn't feel anything but anxiety and anger over my adventures. He tried to work through it, but has since given up and we've closed our relationship. We are working with a therapist to repair some of the emotional damage done to him and hopefully to find some balance between the relationship styles we want.
 
 
 
Since closing, I've felt so many strange emotions. I have this craving for the feeling I got when I was with my other partners, what I believe to be new relationship energy. Experiencing it with others so recently has provided a stark comparision of how little of that energy is left in my relationship with my boyfriend. I still care for him deeply; he's my best friend and I think he's amazing. But even when in these last couple weeks, we've been doing things we love to do with each other, I can't shake this feeling that it isn't right. 
 
 
 
I'm not sure I know how relationships are supposed to look or feel after new relationship energy has worn off. Am I still supposed to think about him all the time? Is it just about being really invested in someone and wanting to be there to experience life with them?
 
 
 
I'm not even sure where I want my life to go at all at this point. I feel so stuck on this path with him; it makes me long for life outside. I catch myself reading roommate wanted ads, fantasizing about a completely different life. I think that I could go on living without him; the idea even excites me a little bit. Are you supposed to be able to feel that way if you really love someone?
 
 
The hardest part for me is knowing how much he loves me. I know that'd I be fine if things were to end, but I'm not sure he would be. Maybe it's because I've been in serious relationships that have ended before and he hasn't. I just know he's not in a good place right now and just the knowledge I feel this way could completely crush him.
 

 
I'm not sure entirely what I'm asking for from you all. Feel free to respond to which ever part you feel prompted to respond to. I guess I'm just trying to vent and get these feelings recorded somewhere before I go silent in our next therapy session, which I have a tendency to do.",,False,self,t5_2qu5n,False,,,True,t3_10ev6y,http://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/10ev6y/what_does_post_nre_love_feel_like/,

First intro into poly!",78,12,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/10h4gx/this_last_weekendwas_tame_but_wow_first_intro/,"So my wife (of 8 years) and i have talked EXTENSIVELY about poly, we truly have incredible communication, we are best friends and there not a single thing that is off limits to talk about.  We are both 28.  She is bisexual, i am not so we have agreed that we want to find another female, primarily for her and if it works out, for both of us.  She has been reading ""the ethical slut"" and has fell in love with the book and her view of jealousy and other emotions have changed dramatically.  She has pretty much been reading it TO me as well.  She views reading this book as her new found therapy.  Her and i have always felt this way, i think, but we were, until the last couple of years, in a very high control, conservative, religion and had to ignore and suppress those feelings.  Well, we are out now so...here we go.  

Anyway, this last week my wife met a girl on OKcupid who was attracted to my wife and said she was totally ok with me being in the picture.  So this was more my wife's date than any sort of relationship for the two of us at this point.

My wifes workmate, who is a lesbian, took my wife and her ""date"" to a lesbian bar in our area, it was my wife's first dip into that pool (she loved it), they danced, kissed and had a great time!  The girl bought my wife drinks, even won a silent auction of a Betty page book for her! (strange i know, but my wife ADORES Betty page).  Anyway later in the night, i got the call to come pick them up, i was at home with a friend (male) and we were just hanging out as guys do, so he left and I went to pick them up  When i got there, it was pretty clear they were intoxicated, my wife went a little overboard, she forgot to eat so the alcohol hit her hard.  Which was sort of the only bad thing since she wanted to be ""there"" for all of this but she just messed up.  It was great though, the girl took really good care of her.

I brought them both back to our house, we took care of my wife together laid her in bed and let her sleep.  The girl and i went downstairs and talked for HOURS, until like 3 in the morning.  It was interesting, she was in a transparent shirt and underwear, which, for me, was a new experience since my wife has been the only person i have been with in the last 8 years, but it was strangely not any sort of big deal, i was just happy she was so comfortable around me to be vulnerable.  The girl asked me about boundaries and i told her that we are still exploring that, but as long as we keep 100% open communication we could feel those out as we go.  She agreed and said she was willing to accept that.  I didn't make any moves on her since as im very cautious about scaring someone or coming on too fast.  I just wanted her to be comfortable.
Shortly after that, my wife woke up and had sobered up, so the girl and I crawled into bed with her and we all talked together for a bit and then slept (legit sleep) with each other until the late morning.  
We got up, made french toast, eggs and juice together.  We went down stairs and my wife and her snuggled and cuddled, kissed and watched cartoons until almost 7pm that day until we had to take her home.  
There was no sex, which we both were TOTALLY ok with.  We had a great time being in her company together.  Sleeping all in the same bed was amazing.  I had my arm around them both, and just feeling the amount of...hmm, i dont want to say ""love"" because we just met her, so im not sure what to use but just feeling a whole lot of something, was amazing.     

Anyway after we took her home my wife and I talked about everything we experienced and were both elated!  Neither of us felt any sort of jealousy, we were both EXTREMELY happy about what the other person got to experience and what we experienced together.  My wife was actually surprised the girl and i didn't do anything.   
So for a first shot, and tame shot at poly, its been amazing.  We both shared this girl, not sexually but intimately and it was like she was part of ""us"".  I realise we just got to know her that evening but it was all very comfortable since everything was out on the table and open.   

I wanted to thank this community for the book recommendation and all of the posts.   Sorry this isnt one of those ""juicy"" posts, but it was a big leap and a great leap for us as a couple!  Although the juicy posts may be coming later i think ;-)

I think I just broke up with a partner over sexual health issues. 

A few weeks ago, after passionate months of sexual tension, we started hooking up with oral sex. Soon after that, he had unprotected PIV sex with someone who was essentially a stranger. 

I haven't touched him since then, mostly because of the sexual health thing, but partly because I felt hurt that he could put me (and thereby my other partner) at such risk willy-nilly. 

I asked if he would get tested. He said he felt fine and would get tested in his own time. He said I was being paranoid about sexual health, and that I should live my life a little bit more freely. He also said he would refuse to wear a condom during a blow job if I were to give one. 

I feel like I'm right here, but I'm a little shaken. I've never had a partner who was so adamantly against what I thought was good sexual health practice.

My network of lovers and lovers lovers all came to visit me, including my two FWBs who surprised me and came by. My boyfriend and girlfriend were super supportive, my boyfriend has been taking care of me for days, and my girlfriend brought me a teddy bear (Tarepanda) and a card and made me chocolate chip cookies. We were all in the same room together and everyone was getting along super well. 

When I got home from the hospital yesterday, I've been staying with my boyfriend, without being too TMI, I have two wounds on my back that need to be tended to and packed with gauze which is very painful. I was hanging out with my FWB waiting for my bf to come home, and my bf was going to change my gauze. Since FWB was there, he helped keep me calm and the boys worked together and made the process so much less painful. 

I am so glad that I have such a great network of people who love me and also who get along. We are a big happy poly family and I am proud and grateful to have them in my life. :) :) :)",,False,self,t5_2qu5n,False,,,True,t3_hw0k1,http://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/hw0k1/a_proud_poly_moment_d/,

1361565882.0,59,self.polyamory,191iaw,Tomorrow I'm introducing my parents to my two girlfriends for the first time. This is the email I sent them explaining my new lifestyle...,69,10,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/191iaw/tomorrow_im_introducing_my_parents_to_my_two/,"**A note about who you will be meeting on Saturday**

I've invited two girls to brunch and dinner on Saturday who are very important to me. I wanted to give you some context about them, and my life lately, before you meet them.

Over the course of the past year, I have grown and learned a tremendous amount about myself. Last winter I started putting a lot of energy getting myself into shape, and dating as much as I could. I continued casually dating like this for quite a while. Eventually, I found myself seeing a few girls regularly enough, and for long enough, that it felt like they weren't so ""casual"" anymore. Everyone knew I was dating other people, but only one knew who they were specifically, by name. Which was actually really nice. It started to really bother me not being fully honest with these girls I was hanging out with so much. By skipping over fun stories I might have just because I was with another girl, felt like I was lying, even if only by omission.

I wasn't ready for a monogamous girlfriend yet though. There is something really wonderful about being able to build a relationship with more than one person. You don't need her to have EVERY SINGLE quality you think you are looking for in a partner. If one hates football for example, I don't need to hold that against her, because I can watch the game with someone else who also loves it. Everyone is different, and each relationship is unique. Because I was seeing a few girls, my relationship with each of them was actually better and stronger than they would have been if I was looking for ""the one"" or something.

So I decided to open up to everyone about everything. My new policy was total honesty, I would no longer have any secrets about anything in my life. I told the girls I was seeing about the other girls I was seeing, by name. I even introduced them to each other, went to concerts with a couple of them together.

I later discovered what I was doing is called polyamory, and that there are a lot of other people doing the same thing.

So I've been doing this for a while now. It has made me a better and more confident person, and changed the way I look at the world. I hear other people complaining about how they fight with their boyfriend, or they don't know what their girlfriend wants, or any of these ""normal"" relationship problems, and I feel… enlightened. I have gone from not being so sure about how to find and be in a relationship, to feeling bad for those who don't get it.

I'm still great friends with two of the girls I was seeing over the summer, and have fallen in love with the third. Her name is ~~[OMITTED]~~, she is my primary girlfriend, and will be joining us for brunch (and probably some of the day). After the summer I began to meet more people who were also polyamorous, some who have been doing it for as long as 12+ years! One of the girls I met is ~~[OMITTED]~~. She has been in an open relationship with her primary boyfriend for a couple years. We fell in love too. She is my other girlfriend, and will be joining us for dinner.

You might think having two girlfriends would divide the attention and energy I'm able to put into each in half, but it's actually the opposite. Each one makes the other stronger, and I can honestly say I've never been in a relationship as good as each of these.


So this is a big part of my life right now. I don't pretend to know whether I'll do this for the rest of my life or not, but it's what I'm doing right now. I am happier than I have ever been in my life, and even just this past year has made me a better and stronger person.

- Paying people to date you does not make you poly
- If you are ok with your partner dating one gender but not the other, you need to reexamine your insecurities. That's sexist.
- Just because you are poly does not mean you are entitled to have people want to date you. You can still be a poor catch.
- It's not about ""keeping score"" with your partner.
- It's not harder for poly guys to get dates than poly women - it's just harder for men to get dates, period. 
- If there's no love involved, then it's not poly. Try /r/nonmonogamy or /r/swinging 
- Women do approach men. Just because they aren't approaching you doesn't mean it doesn't happen.
- The majority of ""rules"" tend to be built to protect the original couple, and are really offensive to new partners when you think about it. Take a look at your rules from an outsider's perspective. Would you date you if you could be vetoed by someone you're not even involved with?
- Forcing your relationships into a hierarchy is stupid and insulting. Just love people, let them be who they are, let the relationship grow into whatever works for the two people involved, and talk about issues as they come up.
- No one on the internet can fix your relationship for you. Go talk to your partner(s). Just communicate and be honest. And don't forget to LISTEN more than you talk.

This is one thing I've always found extremely disturbing... the treatment of cheaters as unquestionably wrong, evil, un-savable deficient persons who deserve whatever happens to them, and the cheated on as unquestionably noble and righteous, so much so that they get a free pass to do bad things / be assholes.

I get that cheating is wrong in a monogamous relationship, and that not everyone is poly, and that the people agreed to be faithful when they signed up for the monogamous relationship, etc.  But the stigma attached to cheating can be unlike anything else in society, even real crimes with actually inherently harmful outcomes.  And some of the comments can be downright *disturbing.*

* time and equity
* how to tell the difference between sex addiction and ""real"" polyamory

From my perspective, it's been very fulfilling, but with occasional spikes of really intense pain. When the pain and insecurity hit, I tend to question if I'm ""really poly"". I've stuck with it because I love my partner, who is poly by orientation, and because every time I imagine my ideal self with my ideal qualities, I always see someone for whom poly is the best choice. Unfortunately, I haven't been very close to my ideal self lately. I've been suffering a lot at times, watching my partner flirt and dance sexily with new connections, and while she's been off on dates with established connections. I've done my best to not interfere with her connecting with other people and to be completely open and honest with her about my feelings. My partner has been wonderful--she's helped me dig into what deeper emotions compose my feelings of jealousy, letting me voice the irrational wants and insecurities.

*Why is is hard for you to watch me flirt?*

Because then you two will want to date.

*And why is that hard?*

Because then you'll want to have sex.

*Where does that lead, aside from sex?*

To me being intermittently stuck imagining you and him together, having sex.

*And why is that painful?*

Because you'll enjoy it more with him, or enjoy *some part of it* more with him.

*And if I do?*

I won't be your favorite.

*You know you not being my favorite wouldn't cause me to leave you, so what in particular makes this idea hard for you?*

I don't know.

And that's as far as most of these lines of inquiry got. It was very enlightening in terms of finding out how I function emotionally, but it always rang a little hollow when I would go back to feeling terrible pretty soon after, despite knowing so much more about myself.  And that terrible feeling had been getting worse lately--I was starting to feel what I can only refer to as *existential* pain, the kind where you feel like you're going to emotionally die.

My partner has a passionate drive to connect with people and a hard-line stance against non-sexual-health restrictions on that. It was becoming clearer as time went on that in my current mindset, I was hitting an unsustainable level of pain (seemingly) in response to these qualities. It was looking dire, but then she said something casually and completely deadpan:

*It's like you get your sense of worth from me.*

Oh, **fuck**.

Suddenly, all of our old conversations had a last line--""Because I get my sense of worth from you."" This is not a state I want to be true about myself, and it's something with clearly actionable approaches. The night and morning after, I still felt a sense of hurt and negative emotions, despite knowing I had the means, motive, and opportunity to change my mindset. Then I realized, my insecurities were fighting for their lives. I said to myself, ""You feel this because you're cutting off your old means of feeling worth. Of course it's scary, but you know there are better ones inside you."" And the pain stopped.  I don't doubt that the pain will come back, but it feels like I have the tools now to keep it manageable.

To me, this finally proves the use of the old poly advice to examine what is underneath your jealousy.  When you finally get to the bottom of it, it loses a lot of its potency.

tl;dr Look deep at your jealousy--dig into it. If what you find out doesn't help, dig deeper. Repeat. Once you know the demon's true name, it has no power over you.

I challenge anyone on here to beat this coming out story.,67,11,50,http://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/o4wcd/ok_fine_i_challenge_anyone_on_here_to_beat_this/,"So, a couple years ago, at the same time I was breaking up with my now ex-wife, I came out as poly to my family.  They had various different reactions (my brother and sister were kind of like ""yeah, what ever"").  My dad banished my lifestyle from his house and did a bunch of research on ""curing people.""

But this story is about my mother.

I live in a certain small city in Colorado that is world famous for it's ""alternative spirituality"" and ""new age woohoo"" scene and my mother fits RIGHT in.

When she heard I was poly, my mother just said ""Of course you are dear, I've known that for years.""  And left it at that.  A few weeks later though, she called me up and asked me to come over saying that she had something ""very important"" to tell me.

&lt;Oh, this isn't just the story of me coming out.  This is also the story of how I realized my mother is absolutely insane.&gt;

So I went up there.  I figured it had something to do with my grandmother.  Her health is terrible, she causes lots of drama and she and I are very close, so sometimes I'm the only one in the family that can talk to her.  My mom takes me out on the back porch and gets out her pendulum.  Then I knew I was going to woohoo land.

My mothers pendulum is made of amathyst and gold, on a little silver chain.  For several years, she's been using it more and more frequently to communicate with various ""spiritual entities.""  I knew she was part of some club of aging hippies who are using pendulums to do some kind of ""work.""  Until this day, I thought it was just another of my mom's crazy spiritual phases.

""It makes sense to me that you're polyamorous, Bard."" She says to me.  ""I've been thinking a lot about it and it's because of your soul mate.""

""OK,"" I say, ready to hear some mystical mumbo jumbo.  Because I know how my mom is.  But then 

&lt;wtf notmakingthisup&gt;

""You and your soulmate came here five thousand years ago from the planet Hutron, in order to learn about Crystal Magic from the ancient Atlanteans.  You both became very good at it and were great Wizards but then Atlantis was attacked by aliens from a dark world who used an orbital space laser to attack the continent.  With the help of an army of Angels lead by the Archangel Michael, the Atlantean wizards raised a magical crystal energy shield to block the space laser.  But the laser was fed by dark energy from the core of the galaxy and was too powerful.  The shield was failing.  So to raise more power, a number of Atlantean wizards, including your soulmate, became desperate and turned to human sacrifice.  However, when this was discovered, it angered the angelic host and they abandoned Atlantis.  

The crystal shield fell and Atlantis was destroyed by the space laser.  The physical incarnations of you and your soulmate and everyone on Atlantis (including many peaceful aliens who were there to learn about magic) were killed.

The angels rounded up the souls of all of the dark wizards who had turned to sacrificing people and imprisoned them in a dark mansion on the astral plane.  Every thousand years, they would give all the dark wizards a chance to repent their actions and many did and were allowed to return and reincarnate on Earth.  However, your soulmate refused and kept saying she would do the same thing again if she had to.

Finally, in August of 1998, on the 5,000th anniversary of the destruction of Atlantis, the Archangel Michael destroyed the souls of all those dark wizards who had refused to repent and purged them from reality.  Including your soulmate, so now you are all alone.

But you shouldn't worry.  The angels notified the Central Command of your home planet of Hutron that they had executed one of it's citizens and Hutron has sent you another soulmate.  She's here in spirit, watching you and she'll be ready to incarnate with you in your next life, so you'll never have to be alone again.

So it makes sense that you're polyamerous, because you have no soulmate and you just have to do the best you can to find happiness in this lifetime.  In your next lifetime, the perfect partner will be there for you.""

&lt;/wtf&gt;

I love my mother.  Really.  But for the past year, I have known she's out of her goddamn mind.

When I told this story to a good friend of mine, he laughed and asked me when the movie is coming out.  I told him it's gonna be a bad anime.

tl;dr: My mom could write for a bad Japanese cartoon studio.  Unfortunately, SHE THINKS IT'S ALL REAL!

1358808006.0,55,self.polyamory,170m03,Being at home: The free-love poly guy's guide to jealousy concerning his previously strict monogamous fiance being out with others.,67,12,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/170m03/being_at_home_the_freelove_poly_guys_guide_to/,"I've never been able to understand the levels of jealousy other people seem to feel. I accept that people have varying degrees of possessiveness and I don't think that's a bad thing. I just try not to compare relationships because to me a relationship is a list of things I am comfortable with doing with a person. It's just always slightly frustrating when I can't convey what I'm (not) feeling when talking to someone who does prefer fidelity. I can still relate though as I've felt jealousy over smaller things. Only simpler things like toys when I was a child.

So my fiancé has just met with, and spent the weekend with, someone he'd met online. Reasons that I'm excited about this is;

* it means he'll probably get new ideas for things to do during sexy times and keep our night time activities fresh and alive.

*  I might get some great porn because my man is in it. He occasionally takes videos with his phone.

* They had so much fun the new guy wants to meet me, and we'll probably hit it off so suddenly threesomes. (This can get tricky with both genders. Gay guys got it easy here.)

What helps fiancé with jealousy;

* We call each other every day and often chat for about an hour. Can get expensive but so far we haven't been apart very long so it's worth it.

* When I return the first thing we do is bone and cuddle for ages. (His request. I ain't even mad.)

* Us getting engaged boosted his confidence in us a lot. It means something to him and he means the same to me so it made sense to accept. Now I'm not saying ""Want to play the field? Propose!"" but what may be a good idea is to be patient and let the relationship develop more and have deeper meaning before approaching the topic again.

* When I want to do things with others I ask him first. I let him know I want to and find out how he feels. If he isn't happy at first we would wait a while for emotions to calm. Later I would encourage him to try the activity for himself. He often found he enjoyed it and understood why I wanted to so now we both freely do many things that were once uncomfortable.

* I have explicitly told him that if he's ever uncomfortable with anything I'm doing I will stop and we can talk and similarly I will let him know if I'm not happy with something. I have also made sure he knows that we can stop advancing any time as I am already happy and would rather keep things the way they are rather than lose him.

What I really recommend to all parties concerned is to be patient with each other and talk. We've taken 4 years and we've only just started exploring fuck buddy territory. It's going to be a while still before the topic of dating is even on the horizon.

* i object to her spending a lot of time with peter (maybe love is endless, but there are only 24 hours in a day), i feel like effort she devotes to that relationship marginalizes our relationship.
* i feel like i've been reduced to some sort of administrative role in our relationship; pick up and drop off the kid at school, take out the trash, make sure the coffers are filled (i.e. retain job), help with dinner, clean house, exercise, rinse and repeat 7 days a week for the next sixteen years or so....feeling like i'm doing it with someone who doesn't seem to be there for me in any sort of sexual or romantic aspect just drives me crazy.  i feel like she devotes most of her effort to this ""other"" relationship that contributes nothing to me.
* peter and i are at super different stages in our lives, and i think the same can be said for the two respective relationships.  my wife and i are pretty far past the young love stage; we're just sort of clearing the ""toddler sleeping through the night"" phase, trying to work on getting the kid out of our bed--obviously nothing about raising children is particularly conducive to sexy time or romantic overtures.  i love my kid, but children are surprisingly hard on a marriage.  the relationship with peter, on the other hand....lacks all of this.  there is no way ""father caring for toddler with full time job, mortgage payment and house to help manage"" is going to be able to compete with peter, the bachelor who has to decide if he's gaming, going out to the bar with friends, hitting the gym or sleeping in.  
* she keeps asking how we can make this work; this drives me crazy, because the terms of our relationship never included some third party.  she then presses me to ""compromise,"" but this just feels heinously unfair.  it's like somebody agreed to sell you Pringles for $2, and one day they show up with a bag of Doritos for $100, and then when you say ""umm, no thank you, and even if it were priced accordingly I don't like Doritos,"" they insist you make a counteroffer.  inane example, but that's literally how it feels.
* i feel like i'm being placated.  i particularly dislike her offer to open things up for me; i don't want that.  if anything, it just made me feel like our relationship was cheaper than i ever imagined and she was just trying to barter our relationship into some box.  i also have no interest in sleeping with other women; even if i did, i also question whether or not she could really, truly make this concession to me (she's always been a little possessive, although not overtly so).
* she claims she can completely separate the two relationships, and i don't even need to know about peter, except for a few occasional times.  this seems like nonsense to me.  she's been glued to her phone, chats with him until wee hours of the morning, and has already visited him for a week twice in the last six months.  the idea that she could somehow make that level of relationship invisible to me seems like wishful thinking. 
* then, of course, there's just good old fashioned jealousy.  i don't believe my wife when she says she has not been intimate with peter.  she admits to an emotional affair; i simply don't believe they haven't been physical on some level.  i don't believe her when she says she ""loves us just the same, but i'm her husband and she'll always be with me.""  i've always been super trusting of her (part of the reason she has this relationship with peter was because i really don't like being possessive, want her to have friends, etc.), and i feel like that trust has been completely violated.  i dislike the idea of her being physically intimate with other men.
* the idea of peter somehow entering our life--particularly financially--makes me frothy.  i don't even like that technically i'm partially funding their current trysts, makes me grind my teeth.

advice?  am I being a ball sack?  as much as it really sort of kills me inside, i'm really feeling like we'd be better off separating, because she's pretty adamant that she can't change how she feels.  separation isn't what i want, but not sure what to do

I am the wife of a married couple. We have talked about and flirted with the idea of being non-monogamous for a long time. Well now we have found a third (Girl) who would has joined us in a triad.  I wanted and agreed to a triad, and my base assumptions were that would be four relationships.  Husband- Wife, Husband - Girl, Wife - Girl, and Husband- Wife -Girl.   We are about two months into this experience - and that doesn't seem to be the case at all.  It has turned into Husband - Girl, Husband - Wife, and occasional threesome. My emotions are going crazy over this. I am feeling inadequate because now my husband I and have only had intercourse twice (including our threesomes, they are usually us pleasuring Girl) during this two months (due to erectile dysfunction or my cycle), and he has intercourse with Girl, several times every time he sees her ( 4-5 days per weeks). I know ""counting kisses"" is bad, but when it is an order of magnitude off isn't that worrisome?  They are interacting with each other often after I am sleep or after I am at work.  I have a very different work schedule than they do.   When we do  hanging out I feel there is this strange awkwardness like they are waiting for me to leave so they can get it on.  Husband says it is just because they were friends first so the two of them have a better connection that me and Girl do.  I am not convinced that Girl wants a connection with me anymore, and has already made statements to the effect that I am demanding too much and am too emotional. Particularly when I was disappointed when she spent our ""date night"" playing video games instead of talking with me. I feel like I am being replaced, and this is taking away from my life and not adding to it.

So I guess this is what I ask this community.  
* How does one deal with jealousy of sex in a V or triad? 

* What scale of ""new relationship mojo"" is to be expected? Meaning, I imagine some of the time discrepancy is the new factor and some of it is ... something else? 

* What are some of the tale tale red flags that I should be aware of. 
 
* How does one deal with insecurity of in a poly rela when you can bias the stats to support your emotions. (ie. how do i deal with the self doubt from his erectile dysfunction which seems to only happen if I am present - he swears that isn't true). 

* How does one manage their time so that the affection level remains the same or goes up for everyone? 

* What do you do when you want to jump ship but your primary partner doesn't?  From his perspective it is still a triad, even though I think it will never be one.

*   And if I do jump ship, how do you shield from the emotional damage   ",,False,self,t5_2qu5n,False,,,True,t3_19d31w,http://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/19d31w/wanted_a_triad_and_got_a_v_what_do/,

1335712790.0,55,self.polyamory,sy7of,On Jealousy...,59,4,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/sy7of/on_jealousy/,"I am a 40ish gay man.  My partner is a late 20's gay man and we've been together for about 5 years.  We decided because (insert huge wall of text here) that we would be poly.  We are both in full agreement about this and the reason is very healthy.

Jealousy still occurs.  I will not lie.  We both still feel it.  It is an ancient emotion hardwired into the human brain.  

But it's not too difficult to rationalize my way out of that feeling.  I made a decision based upon my philosophy of life. I feel the jealousy and acknowledge it for what it is.  It is fear of loss.  It is fear that he will find someone who he knows is better than I am and that he will abandon me in favor of this person.  I fear losing him and the stability he represents.

But it's important to keep in mind a few things:

1) My goal in life is to be as happy as I can be. (this is a selfish goal)

2) I am happiest when I am with my love, who is also happy.

3) Who am I to limit the happiness of my love? I am only empowered to control my own life.  He is still a free entity.  He must be allowed to pursue whatever pursuits that give him joy. I love to see him joyful...it gives me joy.

4) If he finds happiness in the arms of another man then I must embrace this.  He finds a lot of love and security in my arms, and I in his.  If what I offer is not enough for him, then I have the options of allowing him to find the missing pieces elsewhere or losing him entirely.  I see only one rational choice there. 

5) I do not wish to lose him, but I would rather, in the long run, lose him to someone that he thinks will make him happiest.  I would hope that he could pursue both relationships simultaneously, which I think would be best for all of us...but there is a chance that this will not happen.  I must accept this and honor his agency.  He is free to come and go as he pleases.  I would be very sad, even emotionally destroyed for a time.  I would know, however, that my love was happy. Which would give me some joy.

6) I would rather be single than in a relationship with a person who did not want to be in a relationship with me any longer. 

This sounds like an argument for an open relationship.  But we are actively pursuing a 3rd...And we must keep jealousy in mind when we find this person.  Will he pay more attention to one or the other of us? How do we react to this? Will he attempt to separate us and play us against one another? How do we react to this?  If jealousy is dealt with rationally, then these things are more clearly seen as what they are. 

This is all just theory at this stage. We have only played together so far, and there have been minor jealousies that have popped up...we examine them, but we give them no power.  They have no voice in our relationship.

Getting into a poly relationship for the first time is a strange, sometimes unsettling experience (if you're not the person who asked for it).  Same as getting into any *other* kind of relationship.  You have to learn what works for you and what doesn't.  

When you were a teenager, you got into your first relationship.  Now, some people are lucky.  They get into their first relationship and things are amazing and they never have any problems thereafter.  

I don't know any of these people, but I'm sure they exist.  

First relationships are a time to make a lot of mistakes.  How calm you can be while doing that is what will determine how the relationship ends up, generally.  Being gentle with yourself means when something goes wrong, you look around and say 'Okay, two arms, two legs, still alive...how can I respond to this situation in a way that makes things better?'.

Sometimes there won't be a way.  You end the relationship when that happens if you're healthy. (Sometimes you don't. Some people can get by for years on hating each other.  My parents sure did.) 

The point is that, if you're being gentle with yourself and both of you operating under the understanding that this *is* the first time you've done this, when you're new to poly, then you'll be more inclined to forgive mistakes.  The first time your partner sleeps with someone else might be scary.  If you're gentle with yourself, you can say 'I'll get some ice-cream and when they get home, I'll give them a biiig hug!' or 'I'll ask them to talk to me tomorrow, after they've had a good night's sleep'.  

Successful relationships are a skill.  Start from the idea that you and your partner know nothing.  It might not be true, but it's a good place to start, because internally, you'll be more inclined to forgive the mistakes of a beginner.  This kindness will give you the time necessary to build your connections with care and grace.

I am a non-Tibetan, but I live in Tibetan communities and speak fluent Tibetan. I am somewhat 'adopted' into our community.

In central Tibet (the only region for which I have stats), 81% of couples are monogamous, 2-3% are Polygynous and 16% practice some form of Polyandry.  In Eastern Tibet, especially Kham, the region I am most familiar with, polyandry is even more common, but we don't have official stats that I can find.  These forms of marriage are flexible, for example there are cases where four brothers will be married (together) to two sisters.  I have a friend with 4 dads and one dad has another wife as well, who is not a sister.  Polyandry is generally fraternal and polygyny is generally sororal. In other areas, marriages are open, or have a sort of ""dont ask, don't tell"" policy regarding having lovers.  

I've been proposed to multiple times for ""sasum"" (eating triangle=polyandrous) marriage, including by my current SOs cousin-brother on behalf of himself and my SO. I am not currently in a Sasum or poly relationship, but I am surrounded by it constantly and love our poly culture!!!

I want to share our traditional Poly culture! AMA!

**EDIT** wanted to add something: Polyandry is recorded in Tibetan history for at least 1000 years. In the traditional epic of King Gesar of Ling, Gesar's mother had two fathers. One was the King of the Nagas (Snake spirits) and the other was his brother. So fraternal polyandry has been around for a very long time and is regarded very highly! Polygyny, although less common, was also highly regarded. The historical king Songtsen Gampo (604-650 AD) had multiple wives.

I began following this sub because I recently found myself in a polyamorous relationship. I wanted to know more about the culture and about other poly relationships, and this sub has helped me a lot.

I am a straight male who was brought up in an extremely progressive and accepting household. I am not new to the idea of polyamory and I have many poly friends.

Up until now, I have identified as being strictly monogamous in relationships. I still do identify that way. But, I have fallen for a girl who has recently realized (about 8 months ago) that she feels much more comfortable in polyamorous relationships. This girl is amazing. She is honest, interesting, intelligent, geeky, affectionate, and beautiful. When her face lights up with happiness, I feel the glow of her happiness inside me.

She also feels a strong connection with me, and asked me to be her primary. Now, I love this girl. I want to be with her. So, I agreed. But, I am entering into uncharted waters. So, I searched for a community where I can share my thoughts and learn more about the way in which other poly people go about relationships. I understand that it is always different. But, it helps for me to see what issues come up and how people deal with them. It's also nice to see all the loving posts by people who are happy in their current poly relationships.

My girlfriend has two OSOs, one male and one female. Her male OSO is a good friend of mine, and I think this is the part that makes me the most nervous. I don't want to jeopardize my friendship with him. He is married, and his wife and her OSO are also friends of mine. She says that she wants me to explore the possibility of having an OSO of my own, but I don't feel comfortable with that right now. I don't know if I'll ever feel comfortable with it. She also wants to know if I am willing to have threesomes with she and other girls. I don't know if this is something which I will be comfortable with either. I'm a rare dude for whom the fantasy of a threesome doesn't do much. But, she is wonderful and patient and loving and she doesn't push any of these things.

I am generally a long-term relationship kinda guy. And, I have definitely had times when I displayed strong jealousy. But, I also have a list of exes who have given me lots of reasons to be jealous and I have been cheated on several times. The jealousy also makes me nervous. I don't want to lose this girl due to my own jealousy. But, I am approaching this with an open heart and the intent to learn. Whether or not this relationship works out (I really hope it does), I hope to gain a better understanding of myself and my expectations within a relationship, and maybe even conquer some of my jealousy demons.

Today, she went out to breakfast with her OSO and texted me asking if she can spend the night with him this weekend. I don't know if it is just because I knew that this was how it would work, but I don't have any problem with it so far. I feel ok with it. And that feels pretty damn wonderful.

I don't have a specific question or worry that I want to address. I just wanted to introduce myself and thank everyone for participating in this community. It has really helped over the past couple weeks.

TL;DR: I am in a mono/poly relationship and I am happy about it.

I had my first interview with the psychiatrist today to talk about my medications etc and she asked me all the usual questions about my family history, schooling, relationships and so on. Things were going ok, until I told her I was in a triad, and then no matter how much I tried to explain that it was a healthy relationship that made me happy, she would not give up on the idea that it was the source of all my anxiety. She said I must be jealous - I said that no, I wasn't jealous. She said it must be extremely complicated - I said no, I found this relationship easier than any other. She said it was weird that I was such an anxious person but that I wasn't anxious about going out in public with my partners - I told her we weren't exactly rutting like animals in the streets and we just look like a bunch of friends, but she insisted that it made it hard to understand how I couldn't manage everyday tasks like work and study. I told her it makes perfect sense to me because I'm with two people who love and support an nurture me and they make me feel safe, but apparently no, they stress me out and make my life difficult.

I thought about not telling anyone in the hospital about my relationship in case it got in the way of their perception of me and therefore my treatment but I thought 'no, that's ridiculous, people are cool with it'. I guess this is the first time I've really come across someone who can't accept it for what it is, which I should probably be grateful for considering I've been in a poly relationship for a year and a half and never had a problem before.

My night:

I went home per usual after work, went to bed, listened to my audiobook for a bit, relaxed. I found that I was waiting for something before going to bed, and realized that it was just me (I was a little high). So much silence. We have been married for 3 years come May, and have only spent 2 nights away from each other in that time. I'm not sure if this makes 3 times or 2 times. I woke up to find that I was alone. We decided to communicate minimally via text message for now while we're out with our boyfriend girlfriends, but we willingly track each other's phones (kind of creepy at first, but extremely practical—especially if you don't have secrets anyway, but would just like to make sure your SO is not in the river). It also helps for times where the other may take some time to respond, e.g., ""I hope she's okay, I'll just make sure-yup she's at her boyfriend's, nothing to worry about.""

We only have one car, so I told her not to worry about me, and take the car. I took the bus to work today, had a lovely solitary morning. Not something I want every day, but the novelty was quite nice. I observed that she was at her boyfriend's until 11am, at which point I texted:

""Alive?""

She responded:

""So alive. I mean what.""

Then I said:

""Good. That's all. :)""

That's all I know right now, but I can tell she is happy, and we will certainly have a very interesting conversation later on today.

24, female, bi/queer, and very innately poly/nonmonogamous. I've been in only open relationships and poly relationships ever since I started dating at 18. At best, the people I dated honestly, truly supported what I did with or felt for other people, but had no desire to be with other people themselves. At worst they, deep down, wanted to be monogamous but put up with being open because they wanted to be with me.

The latter was especially evident in my last relationship. She knew how I am from the beginning and thought she could and would be okay with it, but she wasn't, a lot of the time. And she generally couldn't admit how much it bothered her, and how much she had to work to be okay with it—because that would mean acknowledging our relationship fundamentally couldn't work. So she insisted on lots of rules (veto power which she did use, no sex/hooking up with other people while she was gone/out of town, etc) and would not generally respond positively when I told her I had a crush on someone, or was attracted to someone, or wanted to sleep with them. There were issues with how I introduced my other partners/lovers to her, with how I acted with her when they were around. There were also some times that were better than others, but there was enough negativity that I began to dread talking to her about those things. That dread, that deep pit-of-the-stomach reluctance to go to your partner with things you really should and ought to be able to discuss with them, is an awful feeling to have.

I encouraged her crushes on other people, offered to go out with her and flirt with other people together (she's shy), suggested we try to find someone we were both into (she is bi too, so it seemed double-y doable). She would say ""maybe sometime"" but clearly wasn't interested. We tried to make it work for a long time, but eventually I just couldn't do it anymore.

Around the time that relationship officially ended, I fell deeply in love with someone new. He's the first person I've been with, ever, who is as open/poly as I am. The contrast of finally dating someone who is actually poly/open blows my mind. We can talk about everything fearlessly. When he's out of town, he encourages me to 'flirt and more' (his words) with other people. I had sex a couple times with a close, mutual friend of ours who we both adore, and he couldn't have been more supportive of it. We had an incredibly hot foursome with another couple, friends of ours. And through all this our relationship has only gotten stronger and stronger. We both are open to the entire spectrum—casual sex with other people; sex together, sex apart; sex with friends (this seems to be the most common thing in my personal experience—extra-relationship sex with people I care about, even love, but not in a defined relationship or even truly romantic sense); relationships with other people together or separately. We are madly in love and incredibly happy.

I regularly see people on here posting about a mono/poly mismatch. I do think it can work, if you aren't too far apart on the spectrum. But the harder you each have to work at it, the more strain it's going to put on you and your relationship, and at some point you need to ask if it's worth it. Especially when the alternative is *so* incredible.

We all sat down and decided that we were unable to meet each others wants in a relationship and called it over. It has been several months now but we still get drunken emails, texts, phone calls and even a letter on our door step. We blocked his phone number once but he seems to have gotten another.

I expressed that ideally anyone in any form of relationship should be open with each other like this. I also expressed that being in an ""open relationship"" and not in a triad or pod where everyone is involved with everyone else does not exclude one from being able to call themselves ""poly."" Even singles and couples could be poly and it doesn't even have to involve sex. 

Not long ago I had a sexual encounter with both my then-girlfriend and wife at the same time, although my girlfriend and wife weren't attracted to each other. It wasn't organic and I felt weird about it, but as long as they were both into it, it was cool. At a later date, when it had been decided that I was going to join the girlfriend and her boyfriend, I found myself uncomfortable and a little pressured, so I stopped, and although he didn't mind, she was shockingly upset. I discovered that she didn't consider us poly unless we all slept together. Somehow I was made to feel that I wasn't poly. I was just ""open."" And that was wrong! Being ""open"" should not have a negative connotation. It felt like being called a ""swinger"" and, frankly, there is nothing wrong with that, either! I reserve the right to love whom I love, and have or don't have sex with whom I choose, without being in a pod, and STILL maintain that I'm poly. 

The part where my little editorial went awry is when I tried to make another point. That's what I want to address here. 

Just having sex with more than one person doesn't make you poly. I went so far as to say that a person who ONLY has sex with a lot of people, in all probability, is a douche. That's where people started getting really offended and the downvotes flooded. 
I'm sorry to have made that sweeping judgement. The discussion that followed was about promiscuity and the immediate negative connotation that it has on our society, and that I was making that same assumption. Well, allow me to clarify my concern.

Promiscuity is, essentially, polyeros, or sex with multiple partners. Polyeros is not the same thing as polyamory, multiple loves. The difference between polyamory and polyeros is the difference between love and sex. You can have love without sex and can also have sex without love.

It is possible to be polyamorous and abstinent. There are people who don't have sex. That doesn't mean they are loveless, and there is no reason their love can't extend to more than one person. 
On the opposite side, it is also possible to engage in polyeros without knowing, feeling, or expressing love. The vast majority of people are capable safe sane casual sexual experiences! Sex is great and having it with multiple people can be fantastic! There is a difference, however between having sex without love and openness and being incapable of sex with it. Being unable to love is a symptom of being a sociopath. Being a sociopath, from my experience, is synonymous with being a douche. I am not saying that polyeros is a bad thing! Being a dick is. 

My current girlfriend was seeing a guy who seemed interested in polyamory. We discovered quickly that it was because he just wanted to have a lot of sex with a lot of people, and because she's poly, she was supposed to be okay with it. He took his other dates to places he had taken her. He lied to her about being sick to cancel their dates so he could screw other people. He took a new girl to see the band that they had planned to go see together, the one that composed ""their song."" He broke up with her via text message. That guy? That's a douche. That's someone who confuses polyeros and polyamory. And that story is far too common. 

But let's don't confuse it. Without love polyeros isn't polyamory. That's the point I'm trying to make. 

Society at large assumes that in polyamory, everybody's recklessly cheating on everybody else, that the consent and compersion are delusions, symptoms of brainwashing from deviant sexual behavior. I posit that the assumption comes, partially, because people have difficulty understanding how sex and love are two different things, completely sex-driven a-holes are far too prevalent, and completely sex-driven genuinely nice people are far too rare.

It's okay to have a partner you don't love. It's fine to have lots of them, actually. Be a slut, but please be an ethical one.

Feel free to keep discussing if you find the topic interesting, but now I'm just waiting to see if he wants to go out again. :)

I went out on a date with a great guy last night. We hit it off intellectually, there was mutual attraction, he was sweet and funny and wasn't a total poly newbie, and he and his wife have both had experience with open relationships in the past. All great so far.

Then the giant red flag came out on the field: he and his wife have a rule. Either she has to be in the same house while he has sex (and then she doesn't get a say in whether or not he HAS that sex), or, before clothes start coming off, he has to contact her and ask for permission to have sex with his partner. Every time, if she's not around. And she can say no. 

I have a big fucking problem with this. I want me and my partner to be in control of our sex life, not a third party (because past trauma blah blah). I hate veto power. So at first glance, I thought this was the dealbreaker and we should just go our separate ways.

But I also haven't met his wife yet. If she's a cool, non-neurotic, reasonable person, I would like to look her in the eyes and ask, as nicely as I can, why her desire to control her husband's dick is more important than my desire to control my own sex life. I want a serious answer, here, because I can't think of a reason that doesn't stem from insecurity/control issues, but maybe there is one. 

I also thought I might be more ok with it if he does the whole 'can I' song and dance before we ever go out on the date, so it doesn't cut into our time and he doesn't have to stop everything to wait for his wife to get in touch with him. But I'm worried that I might be fooling myself because I liked the guy.

I didn't kiss him, even though I wanted to, because this is a tricky situation and I didn't want to fuck things up with that kind of attraction right off the bat. We're both honest, analytical people, which is how this discussion came about in the first place.

Well, lets just say that she's had to be out of town for an extended period for some training for her work and we've been writing letters back and forth. (There's something magical and incredibly intimate to me about a handwritten letter you can touch and hold.)

In my last letter (I write for both my husband and I because his handwriting is just atrocious, worse than a doctor's handwriting, I promise you.) I told her about finding r/polyamory here and all the wonderful people that I've talked to and the information I've found thanks to the brilliant advice. I knew I was going to ask her about agreeing to be our unicorn ('cause I prefer that term more than secondary or tertiary or so on because, well, lets be honest... wouldn't you rather know that you're being asked to join a relationship where you are their mythical treasure?) so I explained as best I could about what you guys here consider unicorns and the definition I have seen here of a unicorn, then I asked her if she would be ours. I followed up with a little joke about how I felt like I'd just asked my first crush out to prom and then about coming up with cute nicknames for each other. 

Well, we got her responding letter yesterday and I just had to share... She said YES! (And she also got a good giggle about the unicorn explanation and said it was very cute. Thanks for the help with explaining what I didn't really know how to explain and for the prep for asking her out!)

We are super excited about our new relationship and so is she... we all can't wait for her to finish her training and come back home! We know that this may not be permanent due to the fact that she may get relocated after her training and sometimes long distance relationships don't work too well, but we are going to enjoy our time with our unicorn and make tons of memories and regardless of what happens, we will always have a fantastic friend in our girl.

I'd disabled it several months before but consider myself basically the same person, so I didn't do much updating aside from newer photos and witty edits to my profile. One question that I had answered previously was on group sex; interested but never tried it. I had completely forgotten about it so I was a little perplexed today...

A couple hours ago, I received an instant message from a 31 year old woman in my city. Her only photo was of a pair of leather boots and a brief description explaining her and her husband are looking for ""friends"" and that they will give more info/photos if asked. We chatted casually about various topics, and I found the conversation flowed easily. Eventually she asked if she could show my profile to her husband and I said okay - she replied that they both thought I was very cute and seemed interesting. She asked various questions about the kinds of guys and girls I'm interested in (although I am listed as straight on my profile) and sent me an email with photos of her and her husband.

Wow. She's absolutely drop dead gorgeous, and I immediately felt an attraction. I unfortunately didn't feel the same way about her husband, but I didn't say that outright...
The conversation moved further and she asked if she could set up a hiking date for sometime this week with her husband. I was disappointed when she said she'd be busy and wouldn't be joining, so I said I would get back to her. She left the conversation at this point, saying it was no pressure and she just wanted to put it out there for me to think on.

Since the conversation, I've been scouring for advice and looking through previous posts from /r/sex and /r/polyamory. Unfortunately, a lot of posts only seem to address things from the couple side of things.
I don't know how to tell the difference between what I find arousing and what I'm actually willing to do. I consider myself quite open-minded sexually - even though I have little experience outside of two VERY vanilla ex-boyfriends - but I don't want to get myself into a situation way out of my comfort zone. I got the sense towards the end that they were looking for more of a ""girlfriend"" for the husband rather than someone to have a threesome with.

What sort of questions should I be asking here? How can I determine if this is actually something I'm ready to try, or if I'm even the right kind of person for polyamory? Any general advice?

After spending some time on polyamory.com, I find it sadly to be quite a negative forum, with a lot of negativity, while /r/polyamory definitely seems more...hmmm...positive? Anyways, I wanted to share my positive story with you guys. :)

Pretty exactly one year ago, my long (long) term partner came to me and confessed her love for a common friend of ours. She was really heartbroken and afraid I would leave her. I kinda knew about it already, and had felt their connection, so I wasn't really shocked. In short summary, I told her it was okay and she could ask if he wanted to be her boyfriend. There started a long and at times quite painfull journey for me, personally, and possibly even more so for my partner (and her boyfriend too). I really wanted to be okay with this, but it was like suddenly finding yourself at 1000 meters under the surface, wanting to be okay with breathing water instead of air. :-D I had so many personal issues to deal with, so much jealousy, so much insecurity...it's amazing how much you can find if you start digging in yourself, instead of others.

Some flaws in our relationship became very obvious, and we realised (or, I realised, she kinda already knew) we had drifted apart the last few years, due to all kinds of stuff happening around us. In a short period of time last year, we made some big changes which have baffled our friends. 6 years ago, at 30, we had built this huge house in the countryside, and we were considered successful by many. Selling that soul-draining house is the best decision we ever made last year. :) Focusing on what is good and right for us, was fantastic. We moved back to the city centre this year, and I feel so much happier and healthier...just wow! :) I love my partner more than ever, and I am truly happy for what she has managed to do. What we have managed to do. I have a leeeeeettle way to go for the whole compersion-thing, but I am truly happy for her. I love the way she glows when she has been with him, I love seeing her truly happy.
They did a tiny get-away at a spa-resorta few days ago, celebrating their one year anniversary, and I am truly happy for them both. Only 2-3 months ago, I would probably not say this, but I would not change this for anything. What it has given me of personal development, the demons I have managed to find and partly control...it's just...amazing. Sure, time and resources are always sought after, but it's getting easier and easier to deal with. 
I love my partner so much and I feel so loved by her, how can I not share that experience? And her OSO is a really good friend, and will remain my family for ever. It has not been an easy journey so far and I have not been the easiest of travel companions, but things are getting better and will hopefully just keep on moving ahead. The biggest changes have not been directly related to her new relationship, but to our existing one, and our surroundings. Making space to breathe and expand is *so* essential!  
I now feel more alive and loved and happy than I have for years! 
It's funny how much three little words can change things.... ""I love him"" ;-)

I had a discussion with both of them, openly, and we all sat down and talked.

It seems like they both had the same attitude - I don't know what polyamory is, so I'm not okay with it.  I told them my needs and wants, and each seemed to understand.  

Last weekend, I had mentioned how much I love them both and want us to be open.  One thing led to another, and we all ended up sharing the same bed.  I cannot describe the feeling of waking up next to the two people I love the most.  The entire night was taboo and exciting, and I loved every minute.

Since then, things have improved a lot.  My current has made some sort of connection with my ex, and treats him like a brother (they are both straight).  They've been hanging out this week, watching TV together, wrestling, etc.  I'm freakin ecstatic.  I honestly didn't think it would happen, ever.

I'm so glad this community exists, because I have no idea who else I could tell.  I wish all of you the best in your endeavors.  ",,False,self,t5_2qu5n,False,,,True,t3_oon9u,http://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/oon9u/update_relationship_with_current_and_ex/,

At the time, I was open to the idea of our relationship being open to multiple sexual partners, but the idea of my boyfriend being in an equally serious relationship with someone else really *really* scared me.


This community was really supportive, and offered a lot of resources to provide a broader perspective of polyamory.  I was able to recognize that my jealousy was rooted in a fear of abandonment, which I then talked about with my boyfriend.  He was so supportive and compassionate throughout the conversation, which in turn helped me identify where my fear was coming from so that I could overcome it.  I realized that one of the most beneficial experiences I could take away from polyamory is how it helps in developing a relationship with *myself*. I realized that I should be my primary partner, and my boyfriend should be his. At first, I was dead-set on establishing rules in order to make myself feel comfortable in my open relationship, but I slowly came to realize that the more comfortable I felt with myself, the less I needed those safety nets. 

I just wanted to thank all of you.  I'm not saying that I am completely cured of my insecurities, but I am well equipped with the resources to battle them! I even allowed myself to have a crush on another guy. When I told my boyfriend, he hugged me and told me how happy he was for me.  Suddenly, in my heart I was screaming ""I ALSO WANT YOU TO BE HAPPY AND EXCITED LIKE THIS"" and I knew that my love for him is infinite and special. Thank you all so much.

We all like to have some random anonymous fun sometimes.  I'm actually serious on this post.

I've had many, many, conversations with people, and they always end up asking the above question.  I can't seem to get it through to people that I don't have a problem with it.  

If my girlfriend fancied someone, and wanted to have a sexual or interpersonal relationship with someone, why would I get in the way?

It just seems odd to me that anyone would stop their significant other from enjoying themselves, as long as you have fully open lines of communication.  Talk about the situation and potential ramifications, make sure there are no double standards anywhere, get approval and go for it.  Just keep in mind the world is a mess of grays, and not as black and white as some seem to want to believe.

How hard is it to believe that if she did have a feeling for that other person that I would not feel slighted?  Sure you have to figure out how to properly pay attention to everyone, but that goes back to communication.  I think it is probably easier if you are Bi, or she only went after people you are attracted to (and visa versa) but even though I am straight, I wouldn't consider another guy competition.  Just another person helping her get more out of her life...

We've spent it mildly tipsy, playing video games, having sex, and chilling the fuck out.

Backstory:

The wife and I are virtually the same age, in our late thirties. Ten+ years together, just had our 5th wedding anniversary in March. We are a VERY close couple, very communicative. It creeps some of our friends out that she and I almost never argue. We are cartoonists, novelists, and artists, of some minor success.

She has a BF, a man that I thoroughly approve of. He is currently living with us temporarily, as his roommate situation is postponed due to slings and arrows. They've been together a year. I love the guy. He's pretty fucking awesome. He's moving out this month, but while he's lived here, it's been great. I totally approve of him, and his moving out, although necessary, will be bittersweet. (He's moving 10 minutes away, so no worries there.)

My own romantic past has been ups and downs, as I'm somewhat picky over the girls I date. Broke up with my last serious GF in October of 2010. Have since pursued a few, to no avail.

Got back in touch with a friend from yesteryear who used to be a FWB with me. We haven't hung out on a regular basis since 1999. Went on a date, a month ago, that culminated in me staying the night. The wife approves of this woman, and we had a second date on Friday that, again, resulted in an overnight stay. She's a single mother now, and we were both stunned during discussions that we both thought of each other as prime dating material back then, but each of us was too intimidated to pursue it. There was a mutual thought that the other was out of our league, which we're now laughing at. She thought I was too hot, too intellectual for her - I thought she was too down to earth, too smart to date a fuckhead like me. Now we're older, and the relationship is starting to form. Sexually, we get along like a shed full of fireworks being lighted. Mentally, we both have a comparitive cynical outlook, with a need for romance. We're taking it slowly. We're both parents now, and our kids get along great. Nevertheless, she's had a LOT of dickheads in her life for the last ten years, and neither of us wants to rush things.

I drove back to my wife Saturday morning with the taste of my lover still on my lips. If I close my eyes, I can still feel her kissing the back of my neck.

That said, the wife and I had a party last night, friends coming over and getting hammered, and got to bed sometime around dawn. We woke at 1 pm today, and had a really gorgeous simultaneous orgasm bout of wake-up sex.

Thanks to everyone who gave me advice.  I decided to talk to my partner, and I learned that I wasn't quite getting all of the information. I have had these talks with him many times, but I made it clear that I really needed something to change this time.  He asked if he could have a talk with her about telling me some things and get back to me, and I agreed.  It turns out that his other partner has been going through a lot lately.  She has been having trouble with anxiety and depression, which I had no idea about.  I suffer from depression as well, so I'm kind of mad at myself for not picking up on this.  It certainly explains why she never goes out and does anything, and wants her boyfriend around constantly.  He told me that he didn't want to share this with me without her permission, which I respect.  He talked to her about letting me in on all of this, and she agreed that I deserved to know, since it was indirectly affecting me.

She has decided to see a therapist, and has also begun to look for a new apartment.  They both agreed that living together wasn't good for either of them right now.  I've decided to be more sensitive to her needs right now and give her time with him.  I also sent her a personal text saying that she didn't have to explain herself or talk about anything with me, but that I was there if she needed anything.  She texted me back thanking me.  Honestly, it's still going to be hard to deal with all this, but I'm glad that everything is out in the open now.  She also knows how I feel about not getting the time I need, so hopefully this will be something that we can actively work on in the future.  I think this has also taught the three of us that we really need to work on our communication skills.  This is a fairly new dynamic for all of us so I know there are going to be bumps, but I'm happy with the way this was handled.  Hopefully things will continue to get better for all of us.",,False,self,t5_2qu5n,False,,,True,t3_1hjjgm,http://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1hjjgm/update_how_to_deal_with_a_clingy_metamour/,

I am watching the tv series Firefly and in one episode one of the characters says ""I ain't so afraid of losing something that I'm afraid of having it.""

This just makes sense for me.  
Its why when my bf first suggested we try poly I just figured, if I can't do it, or he can't do it and we end up apart. At least we had something great for a while.

So far its working we do have something great.  And I love my people.

I'm fine with this, and she and I (27f) know each other from years ago too.

She's married, two children, all seems well. I was off put initially because she says her relationship is Don't Ask, Don't Tell. But she's happy with her life, so I never really thought anything of it.

But as the connection between my partner and her develops, I've become quite confidant her husband doesn't know that their relationship is open. She's nice, I have no issues with them seeing each other, I don't feel threatened... but all signs point to a dishonest relationship. And in the contract my partner and I have, ""No involvement with people cheating"" is the 3rd point.

* Only hotels booked under his name, paid in cash.
* Despite a large social group of common friends (most of who fucked each other at some point, and all know that my primary and I are open/poly) she demands this stays between the three of us.
* Chatting with her husband (also a mutual friend) and he questioned how I wasn't jealous having an open relationship.
* While talking, she told me sheepishly she's cheated near the end of every committed relationship she's been in.
* From anecdotal evidence, she's very adept at telling tales.

My primary doesn't think she's being deceitful. After months of craving, they only started getting together last month, so I suspect some New Relationship Glow. 

Each time I voice my concerns he reacts defensively. When I softly implored with her, she repeated that they're Don't Ask, Don't Tell.

So I'm looking for some feedback, /r/polyamory.

Do you think I'm pulling this conclusion out of thin air? How can I express myself to someone caught up in new relationship glow? 

I feel so guilty being (a probable) accomplice in a cheating marriage. 

**TL;DR** Primary has new partner who seems to be cheating on her husband. Wracked with guilt.

**Edit** I deeply appreciate all the feed back and ideas. I haven't been able to talk to anyone about this, so getting it off my chest and reviving so much thoughtful input is making me feel a lot better.

He's needier than I am and I try to be accommodating. Our girlfriend is a busy lady and I don't want to be one more demand on her time and anyway I have my own stuff going on.  But he's never satisfied with how much time they have together, or the quality of that time.  Once, he texted her angrilly all throughout a date she and I were on, which he had already agreed to the schedule and timing of, and then when we invited him for drinks afterward, he called and yelled at her about ""treating him like an obligation"" and ""only inviting him out of pity.""

It's gotten to the point where she's crying to ME about how much he wants from her and how she can't handle the stress.  She loves him and like I said he's a good guy, he went with her to the hospital when her mom was sick and left work to jumpstart her car battery, and he often does romantic things like flowers and really detailed inside-joke presents and I know he loves her too.
And I love him like a brother. He helped me move, let me crash at his place for a few months when I was broke.  He's not really possessive or controlling, but he's just really easily dissatisfied and I think our girlfriend takes it personally.  I have to reassure her that she IS a good girlfriend.

But she's miserable because she feels like she doesn't do enough for him because of all the effort he puts in, that she doesn't care about him enough.
She can't even enjoy our time together anymore because she's guilty or scared he's going to be angry or sad about being ignored.  We end up having a lot of three-person ""dates"".

The title is dramatic, and I apologize. I wanted to get everyone’s attention. I’ve been lurking here for most of a year. A part of me says that means I have no right to the observations I’m making, but I do have a good bit of poly experience.

I’m pretty close to 50 years old, and my first poly relationship was at the age of 19. Back then we didn’t call it “poly” -- we had uncomfortable conversations that went like this: “I think we should see other people... too”. I’ve had a number of triads and other more loose arrangements. My wife was also raised by a triad (she did an AMA here last year).

One thing I’ve learned, and this is important: Poly and Drama go together like oil and, well, oil. This does not make drama good.. I’ve had my share of dramatic moments. I’ve had partners die from accidents, attempt to commit suicide multiple times, and, in the most recent case, just threaten suicide in an attempt to manipulate. (As much as every suicide threat should be taken seriously, we ended the relationship that night and made sure there was someone there for her. She was not suicidal and I suspect the relationship was what was making her unhappy.)

I have some general observations about poly (and drama). I think they are pretty important:

* Drama hinders communications. The three most important things in poly are Communicate, Communicate, and Communicate. While we may think that we are Expressing How We Feel, emoting has a funny way of shutting off the ears (not to mention abstract thought that might find a solution).
* If you are poly and insist on being involved with mono people, then you are a sadist. They will not take joy in your lifestyle and you will bring them a great deal of grief. When your relationship goes south, we should not comfort you.
* If you think you can proselytize the poly lifestyle by  “turning” mono folk poly, then you’re an idiot. This is a lot like a straight guy telling a lesbian “you just haven’t met the right man.” Ewww.
* Are you mono? Did your partner just come out as poly? My condolences, but if you’re mono, you should end the relationship. Your partner has just declared that their lifestyle is more important than your relationship.
* Trying poly and your partner wants to close the relationship (cutting off the secondaries)? Figuring out if you’re poly is hard. Keep it closed until you’re certain they are certain. Otherwise...
* Did your primary poly partner declare they want to be mono with you? Again, my condolences and DTMFA unless you want to go mono too.
* Having problems with jealousy? Most of us do. Think about this: If you cannot stomach equality and allow your partners the same privileges then you might want to reconsider whether you are poly. (You might just be more interested in Dominance/Submission fantasies -- that’s okay, but that’s something else.)
* Just have a breakup? You poor thing! I suspect poly folks go through a lot more relationships than monogamous ones -- that means you can experience far more of them in the poly lifestyle. If this is a problem for you, you should consider long term diadic relationships. You might be bored, but you won’t be traumatized.
* If you start a post with “My husband/wife wants to open the relationship.” The answer is, yes, you do have something to worry about. Your partner, who pledged their entire future life to you, would like to change the terms of what was supposed to be a permanent relationship. This is almost never (IME) a good thing.
* Do something you shouldn’t have with someone you shouldn’t have? Yes, it really is as bad as in a mono relationship. You’ve betrayed a trust -- isn’t that always bad?
* Does your partner want to try poly? It really could be that they are bored of you and want to start a new relationship before they boot you to the curb. They might not be poly; they might be a confused and bored serial monogamist instead.

Folks, emoting won’t solve your problem. No one is going to swoop out of the sky to rescue you. No one is going to give you a magic pill and make it all better. You create your own poly problems and you are the only one who can solve them. And that comfort you think you’ll get from dramatic posts? If you didn’t learn any lessons from the situation, then you’re just going to do it again.

What it boils down to is this: If you cannot rationally talk about a problem, then you are not ready to talk about it. If you think you’re rational and you’re not, you are *really* not ready to talk about it. You will not be able to listen to solutions until you can discuss the problem rationally. If you think there is a possibility that you sound like a petulant child in your post, then you might want to consider the legitimacy of your problem.

Some therapists take good money to listen to people’s problems without solving them. If you just need to complain, I’d consider that. [CoDA](http://www.coda.org) has nice self help meetings too.

Update: As many people have pointed out, I speak in generalities. These things are generally true. In most cases, as advice, I stand by all of this. But, as with everything else, YMMV.

I have an acquaintance I've been mildly crushing on for a while. I think there's a bit of mutual interest, but our interactions are fairly sparse and only take place in a casual public setting. I'm open about being poly, but it's not the sort of thing that comes up naturally in this kind of situation. Well, today it came up that I'm seeing someone in a way that was totally tangential to the conversation that I was tangentially participating in, and there was no way to clarify that it wasn't exclusive in a non-awkward manner. It feels like saying ""...but I'm still available"" is equivalent to saying ""hey I have a crush on you that everyone in the vicinity needs to know about.""

I hate unintentionally closing doors like that :c

**edit:** It's probably relevant to mention that I'm a female in a predominantly male engineering school in the Midwest. It's pretty conservative here and almost no one knows that polyamory exists until I explain it to them. These interactions occur in the computer science department, where I am often literally the only woman in the room. As I said before, being open is not the problem. the problem is that in casual conversation, the aforementioned in particular, I would have to go out of my way to make it known that I'm not monogamous.

Turns out she's interested in dating me. She then proceeds to do everything you should not do to impress me. 

My husband has had a long time female friend, Jane. A year ago she was hitting him up hard that we (Jane, her husband, my husband, and I) should spend more time together. She thought that we really had our life together and that they could benefit from having such mature and stable friends. When my husband told me this, my response was that while I was flattered I was pretty certain that they were the crux of their drama. Getting closer to them would only drag their drama into our life.

Over the past year Jane and my husband have hung out some, but for the most part their relationship consisted of them making plans, and then having her change them multiple times only to cancel last minute. I stopped planning around their outings because they fell through so often. My husband was willing to put up with it and I was willing to let him make that choice. Her behavior did however sour my opinion of her. We have very busy lives and I place a lot of importance on respecting peoples time and the plans you make with them. 

I've spent the last few months working on me and not dating. Recently I found someone that seems nice. My husband told Jane that this girl was interested in dating me, to which she replied she'd love to be able to date me. He relayed this conversation to me (because we're in high school).

I wasn't too terribly impressed. I was getting a pretty sizable red flag that if I did choose to date her I could look forward to flaky scheduling and third party communication. She made plans to come to our house Thursday. I cleaned, bought a nice dinner and then waited for her to not show. The plans changed a couple times but in the end something came up and she couldn't make it. 
I made a FB post about enjoying my (new) plans for the night and she posted that she was sorry for canceling but she was looking forward to seeing me the next day. 
This was the first direct conversation that I'd had with her in over six months. I deleted her comments because they didn't pertain to the original post. Messaged her that I had done so and that I was unaware of any plans she'd made to see me. I told her she should contact me in some form other than publicly on FB to figure it out. 

She responded to my message. She clarified that she'd told my husband upon canceling the night before that she'd swing by after work for a very quick visit. We chatted a bit and left it at that. 

Two hours after the time she said she got off work I messaged her saying that I was done waiting around and not terribly happy. I put my phone on the charger and proceeded to walk away from the issue for some quiet time. About an hour later she showed up at our house with her husband in tow after texting my husband apologies, excuses, and informing him that the plans had changed. They were no longer stopping by for a quick visit but were going to stay for a while. We had an casual impromptu dinner and drinks. I was pleasant but pretty much done with any goodwill I had towards her. A bit after 9pm I started pointing out that my husband had plans to go out and needed to do so and I was looking forward to a night alone. Jane was going to the same event and they decided to go together. Neither wanted to stay out late. I waved merrily as I saw them all out. 

At 2:33 in the morning I woke up to the dog barking at the front door. 
I'd locked the door and my husband didn't have a key (he'd forgotten to get it back from a friend who had stayed with us recently). I opened the door. There was my husband, Jane and another well known friend. I let them in and proceeded to tuck my child back into bed.

This is where it get's interesting. Jane is drunk off her ass. Loud, stumbling and pretty damn flirty. She hadn't been able to drive and my husband had driven her car back to our house.
My husband explained the plan: She was far too drunk to drive her car home, he was going to get some food in her then drive her and her car back to her place with our friend following. Then my husband and Friend would drive back to our place and he'd crash in the guest room for the night. This was fine. We spent the next half hour getting her closer to sober. 

As always there was the fun part of being sober and taunting the drunk person. She complained about seeing double. I told her to close one of her eyes and after she confusingly did so her face lit up like a child on christmas morning. 
I also told her to down a glass of water before bed then take an airborne in the morning when she revealed she needed to be in another state for an event the coming night. I doubt she remembered, though.

At one point, she suddenly pointed out that it was after midnight and why wasn't I in bed? My friend offered  ""I think she *was*.""
She drunkenly confronted me, ""You really hate me, don't you?""
I looked straight at her, ""I think 'hate' is a very strong word… I dislike it when people and the time they've set aside to be with someone is disrespected.""

My husband later told me about her various attempts to seriously come onto him throughout the night and the car ride home where she went so far as to grab his hand and put it on her crotch. He had the drunk talk with her, that although he found her attractive at no point tonight would he sleep with her because she was drunk. That he was her friend, and part of being a good friend was not enabling things you'd regret the next morning (and would completely fuck up your life, as well).
The fun part? Her relationship is a OPP. We ALL know this.

My husband voiced quite a bit of concern, that if he had not been there, or she'd gone with a less moral friend, she might have made some seriously regrettable choices. 

My husband and I also had quite a bit of fun the next day as he retold various parts of the evening. We laughed and then we agreed that this is a funny-one-time humor and should never happen again.

Some people talk about how poly is so much better than mono. I'm poly because that's what I am. It's got it's good sides and it's bad sides. Some of the bad is that you get presented with all the crazy that comes with the trial and error of dating. I don't actually like that part. NRE is fun and all but I much prefer the joy of a solid well established relationship. Maybe it's because I keep running into these. 

On the positive side, part of my private time last night was spent texting that other girl that I AM interested in. It invovled me telling a story of an inanimate object she'd accidentally left at my house. It was acted out in staged pictures.  It was a very humorous and enjoyable convo and I had a blast staging the ridiculous pictures. Her beau even got in on it during the story telling and texted prompts along the way.

At some level, we have agreed to unspoken limits on what intimacy I'm allowed to engage in with others (""friendly"" intimacy, hugs, eg, being allowed). But in general I am still full capable of loving those others within the rules of the relationship we've defined. 

To go into more detail than is necessary: I've been thinking of love as something along the lines of the Greek classification: Agape, Philos, Eros. Let's say that they translate to compassion, fidelity, and intimacy. We each feel these things to a degree with many people around us. We may feel compassion for strangers, compassion and fidelity for friends, and all three for ""relationships."" [I'm not a person who can do intimacy without fidelity, so I would simply rather not comment on those relationships other than to say I don't think they're better or worse than anything else, I just haven't the experience to speak to them.]

But I think, ultimately, when we speak of what bounds we place on one another's ""love,"" it's often in the realm of intimacy. What levels of closeness you can or can't have with others in your life. - I guess people also put limits on fidelity as well, in so far as we sometimes ask for a hierarchy of fidelity. (eg, my relationship with my wife comes before the relationship with others to whom I may feel another degree of ""love"")

My wife of 5 years and I decided to open our relationship about a year ago. We've had our fair share of problems and growing pains, but also quite a few successes and have definitely built wonderful and close relationships with some fantastic people. A lot of what I've read in books and on this subreddit (obviously) has a lot to do with communication and making sure both your own needs are met or how you can make sure you're meeting your partners' needs, but people rarely admit or talk about the occasions when they just can't personally fill those needs. Something really clicked for me today. This last week has been incredibly tough for us in just about every way that isn't relationship related (work, finances, family stresses, car trouble, etc) and I've just felt incapable of making things better for her. I realized that I'm trying to do too much when I don't have to face it alone. 

She has been consistently dating two other great people and had a casual date night planned for tonight. We're all friends but we generally keep our separate relationships exactly that, separate. Knowing how much he also cares about her, I went out on a limb and talked to the guy my wife is meeting tonight. I briefly described how life has got her down lately and that she could really use a fun night out as a break to distract her from everything that's going on. Not only was he happy that I felt so comfortable talking to him about everything, he was really excited for the heads up to plan an extra fun time for them tonight. I guess I just wanted to share another poly success! Feels good man.

http://theramblingextrovert.blogspot.com.au/2012/05/broken-refrigerator.html (hope this isn't blogspam?)

Otherwise, here's the full text:

The broken refrigerator analogy (http://www.morethantwo.com/jealousypractice.html) is something that really spoke to me when I first read about it.

The analogy goes like this:

*Imagine you have a refrigerator. One day, it stops working - you come home to find your ice-cream melted, your milk warm and smelly, and your vegetables

You have three options at the moment: you can figure out how to fix the refrigerator; you can throw it away and buy a new one; or, you can decide to keep it as it is but never buy any foods that need to be frozen or refrigerated.*

The last option is patently ridiculous; and yet it is the one most people in the poly community seem to choose. That is, when someone feels jealousy at their partner doing a particular thing, they make a rule against the thing rather than trying to find the cause of the jealousy.

The article I linked to above goes into LOTS of detail explaining it, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who hasn't already read it and is interested in polyamory or open relationships.

I had an experience the other day that made me think back to the refrigerator analogy:

Miss Prism was joking to a female friend of hers, asking her if she wanted to have a threesome with herself and my beloved Mr Oldman. Watching this happen in front of me made me seethe with jealousy - I wanted to be part of such a threesome, thankyouverymuch! I wanted to provide Mr Oldman with an outlet for that stock straight male fantasy!

It got to the point where I was going to pull them both aside and tell them I wouldn't be comfortable with Mr Oldman having a threesome unless I got to be a part of it, even though I knew this proposition was a joke and the chances of the threesome happening were almost nil.

Then I thought about the refrigerator. Clearly, this hypothetical refrigerator of ours was broken and I was about to propose he stop buying frozen foods. Really, I should try and fix it instead.

I thought about Mr Oldman. I imagined the joy on his face if this hypothetical threesome were to occur, and immediately felt a little bit of compersion at the idea. I imagined how wonderful that day would be and who would I be to take that away from him!

Then I thought about why I was feeling jealousy - it's because I wanted to do something nice for my partner. I wanted to make him happy. And him having a threesome with two other women wouldn't infringe on that; in fact, my making a rule against it would have been the exact opposite of what I really wanted!",,False,self,t5_2qu5n,False,,,True,t3_u8ph9,http://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/u8ph9/my_experiences_with_using_the_broken_refrigerator/,

About a year ago my husband (26) and I (29) decided to open our relationship. I had always felt some polyamorous tendencies and he and I had discussed for a couple of years before actually trying to meet new people. I had never felt like I was in a relationship that could handle the addition of other partners before my husband. He was a bit hesitant at first, but agreed to try it with me and eventually seemed very supportive of it. 

It went pretty well for us for a while; we were both successful in finding dates and both found secondary partners. My boyfriend was a fair bit older than my husband and his girlfriend, and didn't really fit in with them personality-wise, but I spent a lot of time with my husband's girlfriend and her fiance. We got along pretty well. 

I felt like my relationships with other men made me feel closer to my husband. We talked more, had sex more, and I loved him more. But then that started to change when he started seeing his girlfriend. After the four of us (me and my husband, his girlfriend and her fiance) would hang out, he would stay out with her when he was supposed to come home with me. When the four of us were together, I would feel invisible to him and he would be overly affectionate with her. There were times when I would be literally pulling him away from her towards me and it didn't work. His sex and sexual experimentation with her got more frequent and more advanced, and then he stopped initiating sex with me at all. He continued to text her when out on date nights with me, and then the date nights with me became less frequent. We had a lot of talks about it, and a lot of fights. Each time we had a talk I stressed that I felt all of the issues had the same root cause - when he was with her, he would forget about my feelings and how his actions would affect me. After the talk things would be fine for a few weeks, then he'd find some new way to hurt me all over again. I felt like he loved her more and she got the best of him, then I got what was left over. Eventually I couldn't handle the jealousy anymore and I had a meltdown.

During the meltdown phase, my boyfriend was incredibly unsupportive and too demanding of me, so I ended things with him. I agreed to help my husband work through the issues and come to a solution where he could stay with his girlfriend. I liked her, I wanted it to work, I just didn't want him to treat me like I didn't matter to him anymore. Anyway, we tried it for a while and things just got worse. He started lying to me about when he was talking to her. He brought her to our apartment while I was gone for a day when I specifically asked him not to. That was it for me, I felt so marginalized and hurt. I felt like he cheated on me. After our worst fight ever, he agreed to break up with her. 

That was back in March. So it's been 4 months of just my husband and I trying to rebuild and it isn't working at all. I feel like we're closer to divorce than the loving relationship we once had. I'm just so angry at him all the time. He says that he loves me, and he chose me, and he wants to make this work. He says that he didn't know that he was hurting me all of those times. I feel like I can't believe him and I can't trust him. My husband used to make me feel invincible - he made me feel smart, sexy, beautiful, like I could accomplish anything. I feel none of that now. His girlfriend was much more attractive than I am, so now when I look at myself I just feel ugly and disgusted. My self esteem is gone, from my personal life and my work life. I have no motivation to do anything - I never want to go anywhere and when I do go out with my husband the only thing on my mind is how much more fun he'd be having if he was with her instead. I honestly believe that my husband would be happier with her in the long run, that he married me before he knew what it was that would actually make him happy. 

I just don't know what to do anymore. I'm not sure if I even love my husband anymore. When I look at him I see someone completely different than the man that I married. I see someone that lied to me, cheated on me, took everything from me. Sometimes when I look at him I'm just so angry that I want to punch him, or do something to hurt him so that he feels the way I do. Sometimes when I look at myself I see someone so ugly, worthless, and pathetic that I feel I deserve this and it was my fault for being so stupid as to think that someone like me could hold the interest of a man. And sometimes I'm even mad at him for taking polyamory away from me. I'm scared that the only thing that's stopping us from getting better is me and my inability to get over my anger, but I just don't know how to forgive him and start trusting him again. I'm scared the man that I loved and married is gone forever and it's my fault.

I thought things would be easier if we were friends, so we could also all hang out together.

I'm not against their relationship, I love seeing my husband happy. But I'm 37 weeks pregnant and I just want him to be home with me right now. I have no issues at all if she is here as well. They can cuddle, have sex, sleep together, whatever they want to do. I'll even sleep in the other room if that makes them feel more comfortable. 

But they don't want that. So now I'm stuck not having my husband with me when I can go into labor at any given moment. He is being ""fair"" about it. Right now he sees her 3 nights a week, me the rest. Which is perfectly fine with me, if I weren't about to pop out a little human being.

He is always close and I know that labor doesn't go that fast for a first time mom. I can call him at any time and he will be home within the hour.

I just wish I wasn't the only one trying. I feel like I am. I feel like I am making all this effort... I feel like I am trying to do everything I can... and they (both) just refuse to work with me and become more comfortable to all be together so I don't have to be alone if labor starts.

This is probably a lot of hormones as well. Maybe I am exaggerating. 

She is younger, and insecure, and afraid that he will leave her after the baby is born, that he won't have time for her anymore. And I understand that he loves her and wants to do what he can to make her feel good. And I understand that I am more mature about this, more comfortable with this lifestyle and therefor more sacrifice is being asked of me.

But I don't want to spend the night alone again. I'm scared. I've never done this giving birth thing before. I don't know what is going to happen... (well.. I've read all the books, all the articles etc. but I have never experienced it).

Am I way out of line to ask him to stay home at night? She is going on a holiday next week so for at least a week and a half he will be home with me, but he will still spend Saturday night and Sunday during the day with her (Friday night and Saturday during the day with me). 

Is this just me being hormonal? I get that normal fair is more or less equal time. But am I way out of line to think that normal fair doesn't really count right now? That I should be more important? That just because I could handle him not being here, doesn't mean that I should have to handle that...

It was a challenging but rewarding weekend for me as I was able to overcome a lot of my weird jealously feels (weird because they've been dating a lot lot longer than I've even known S) by talking ti T and S and spending a little bit of alone time with S that T went out of the way to give us :3

S was probably balls-to-the-wall happy as she got to spend time with the two people she loved and got to be the middle-cuddle spoon.

So my partner and I (Me 26/M, her 24) have been dating for between a year and a half and a year.

She was poly before I met her and I knew what I was getting into when I started dating her. Personally, I thought it would help me with the more irrational parts of my jealosy that I've previously had in the past (which, to my surprise actually, it has helped). After the first initial bits of jealosy that we talked about, we moved on and everything's been smooth sailing since: until now.

Lately I've been really insecure about, well, basically, everything.

It bums me out, a lot. 

Part of the problem is that I have a lot of issues talking to members of the opposite sex. Part of it is being a geeky kid, part of it is not having a lot of confidence in myself, part of it is I see dudes are bars or whatever hitting on girls and my first thoughts are ""Wow, that's a shitty dude.""

Her on the other hand, is a cute bi girl. So, obviously, it doesn't take much for her to find a willing partner. It's really just nubmers at this point.

So, lately, that fact has been bugging me. I know it's not a race or a contest (that would be really shitty if it was), but I've been finding myself kinda lonele lately and she's been out with new partners.

We were talking about things recently and she said something (that she's said before, but not about me) that really rubs me the wrong way.

""I'm not responsible for your happiness.""

While that's true, you should put some value in it, correct? When I hear that, my mind kinda replaces things and it turns into, ""I know this thing I'm going to do is going to hurt you, but I don't care.""

I don't know whether I'm putting too much thought into that. Maybe I need to stop sucking at dating and do better. Maybe I just suck and Poly isn't for me. Maybe I should stop being a sensitive snowflake.

I dunno, any thoughts?

TL:DR: I'm a sensitive snowflake and have been dealing with insecurities lately

I had a thought about this.

Monogamous relationships have their own difficulties and challenges to get through just like polyamorous relationships. However, I think monogamous relationships have more support in society which helps those involved in those types of relationships work through their issues and deal with it because it is a model visibly  supported by a great number of others. 

That's why I think subreddits like this one are absolutely essential and amazing. Even though there's compounding literature about polyamory and it is being hailed as this generation's sexual revolution, actually ironing out the every day maintenance and mishaps is difficult, and even more so when you feel like there aren't widely available resources to help you out.

So, since I have been chewing you all an ear off in the recent weeks, I thought I owe you all an update!

The setup was [m]e and my wife travelling to my (medium distance) gf, since for now we have the rule to not leave anyone alone for a weekend and since the two women get along very well, both were looking forward to meet again anyway. But our ""structure"" is more of a ""Vee"" than a triad (to be precise, we are more like a ""w"", since my gf has a husband, who also has a gf). We arrived on saturday around noon and although the first greeting was a slightly bit awkward, we quickly relaxed and did the usual ""look at my home""-tour and then had some coffee together. And this was really nice to relax together and to catch up on everything. And after a short while my wife went ahead and said to my gf: ""Could you show me, how I get to that café you mentioned? I think you two want to get your alone-time!"" - We had agreed before, that my wife would spend the afternoon in the city, either shopping or in a café with her laptop, writing. But since my gf and me were both a bit nervous to just bluntly send my wife off, she really saved the event!

We then brought her to the tram together, kissed goodbye and there I was, alone with my gf :) We were both totally excited and well.. hit the bed :D We hadn't seen (except online) for 10 weeks, so.. we made up for that time. Some hours later we went into town and fetched my wife, walked around a bit and then decided to cook instead of going to a restaurant, since the sushi place we had in mind was totally crowded. So we returned to my gf's place and cooked ourselves a nice dinner and later sat together on the couch, cuddling and talking and drinking a bit. Since my wife had her period, she told us to just go ahead and hit the sheets for another round, while she stayed on the couch to read. And since I always obey my wife... ;)

Later the three of us cuddled together in my gf's bed, which was really awesome :) and waking up together was great as well. Only my gf complained a bit, that I would emit too much heat and almost cooked her during the night...

Then we made a really lazy and decadent brunch with eggs and bacon, fresh bread and lots of coffee and tea and talking, all the while touching, kissing, cuddling. It was all so absolutely harmonic! Since we were so exhausted from all this eating, we decided it's time for another nap... and after a shower we did a stroll through a nearby park, hand in hand in hand! And we shifted positions all the time, like we had this planned, which was also really wonderful. And I enjoyed a bit the looks from strangers, partly surprised / irritated, sometimes envious :D

And all too soon the weekend was ending and my wife and me had to go home again... :(

On to the rant:


It's been driving me nuts lately how, whenever there's a post with someone (usually a guy) complaining about how they don't like that their partner has friends, or a friend, of the opposite gender the responses always seem to go along the lines of ""guys are only friends with girls if they want to get inside their pants, obviously something's going on or she wouldn't be hanging out with him"". Really? Are there really still people, in the year 20-fucking-11 who honestly believe that a man and a woman cannot genuinely want to be friends without there always being a subtext of ""trying to get into their pants""? Now, don't get me wrong, if it's a case of sneaking around seeing the friend without telling your partner or ignoring your partner when they voice their apprehensions about it that's something else, what keeps annoying me is just the attitude that it's not possible to be friends with someone who you're potentially sexually attracted to without there being ulterior motives and without it being perceived as a threat to the relationships you're in (especially male-female friendships as I've not seen this being called a problem as much when it's same sex friends even if one or both of them are bi or gay). I mean, I find almost every single friend I have attractive! That doesn't mean I'm actually interested in dating, or even having sex, with them and if I wasn't ""allowed"" to be friends with someone I find hot or who finds me hot, I'd be about the biggest loner on the planet. It's just so....argh!

And the thing is... I get monogamy (or, I suppose, monoamory even though that term is never used). My relationship is mono at the moment and maybe that how it'll stay, who knows? I love poly (at least in theory as I haven't tried it yet) and the attitudes that tend to go hand-in-hand with it (openness, honesty etc) but I still think that for a lot of people, maybe even for me, mono is still the more favorable choice. However, I *cannot* understand this need to extend the ""mono-ness"" beyond the sexual and romantic sphere and into the social, friendship sphere (mono-amity, if you will, lol)! If you trust that your partner wouldn't cheat on you then it shouldn't matter who their friends are so long as they still listen to you and are upfront with you about it. And if you genuinely think that your partner is likely to cheat on you at any moment and the only reason they maintain certain friendship is for sex, then why the heck are you with that person in the first place? Again I say: argh!


Hrm... right, I shall step off the soap-box now. If anyone actually read through the wall of text I suspect has formed above: thank you for letting me vent! r/polyamory rocks.

This is likely to be a bit scattered as I decided to just let it go from brain to keyboard without any filter or organization. Forgive the mess.

I come from a conservative family. You can take the weight of that statement and amplify it a bit. But as I've distanced my self from them, and from their ways of life I've come to find that my belief structure has changed over the years. Every time I think I've figured something out I'm shocked by my own preconceive notions as something new comes barreling into my life.

I met a girl. She became a peer a friend and I felt my self falling for her. I'm a terribly shy person. I asked her out. Took 3 weeks to pysche my self up to do it. But we went out and I felt as though things were really clicking. Been seeing her more and more over the past several weeks. Its like I had finally met some one who I could make a real connection with, not just some one I was attracted to, or some one totally platonic but some one who I wanted for the first time in a long time to be completely emotionally honest with and some one I wanted to share my self, my passions, and my little slice of this world with.

And then, like a 4 ton elephant crashing through the ceiling into a dining hall, I find that she's with some one, and maybe some one else, and I realize I'm standing in the middle of a group of people who quite possibly are all in multiple relationships.... I was in stunned silence and the expression on my face was probably much like you would expect the onlookers of such an elephant in a dining hall.

I'm fairly good at compartmentalizing. The information was too much to be processed on the spot. I let it wash over me like a bucket of ice water took a breath and then moved forward. If anyone noticed my shock they were kind enough not to say anything to me about it. 

Once I was alone with my thoughts: Fear, doubt, sadness, frustration, tears, text messages to friends (not imparting peoples personal business just that I suddenly felt crushed, best not to comment on other peoples relationships conventional or unconventional relationships... conventional shitty term, conventional by the crap standards of my up bringing more like. ) ... 

Google. Turn off the emotion factory for a moment and learn something.

Information overload. I know nothing about this. This didn't even exist to me until that moment. It is as far from something I even believed possible as the most distant stars in the sky. 

FEAR. 

but...

I still feel the same about her, her smile still melts my brain, she still makes me laugh, she still challenges me to be better, she still sets me on fire when she walks into the room....

Assessment:

I don't want to get crushed

I don't want her to get hurt

I don't want anyone she's involved with to get hurt....


That last one surprised me even as I thought it. I've never... the concept of anything other than a pair... Again, I come from a conservative family. It took me a long time to understand and unlearn many things that were beaten into my mind the prejudices and the bigotry towards people different from me... 

But this scares me to the core. I want to come to terms with that. There isn't currently a stated relationship between us. ... I'm sure that term is probably going to get tossed out the window some where along the way too... 'stated...' bleh. Or not.... 

--walked away from the keyboard for a moment shift in train of thought--

Jealousy, seems to be a topic in a lot of FAQs. The idea of being so open with one person is something that has taken me a long time to find and embrace, and now I have to make a step towards being open with... I don't know who, more, how many, how when?  if I want to pursue this. ... I don't have words to describe why my stomach is churning and my blood feels like ice in my veins ... if I want to pursue this I need to be something more than I am now and I'm not certain how to get there. 

We have not talked about this yet her and I. Things are calm, they are as they were before but I know that as long as I pursue this with her the conversation is coming, and before it happens I want to understand. I want to be something better than I am because I feel like this abject fear that I have can't be rational. 

Conceptually I can understand how this can work in all its variations. In practice I've seen only dysfunctional pairings; my own relationships as well as those of my social circles. If I couldn't ever get things to work with one person how could I ever juggle the wants and needs and concerns... the heart of another person in her life who may not even want me to be part of her life.... I want to be better, for me, and for her, and for the them that I don't yet know...

So that's my life at the moment laid bare. I'm a bit of a wreck at the moment its a lot to process. So... yeah. Hi new world I didn't know existed. I'm a bit lost and confused and kind of scared but I want to understand.

I am loving polyamory thus far! I am 23, F, bisexual, and have been extremely happily exclusive with my soulmate for 4 years. We recently decided to open our relationship up to polyamory. We were planning on doing so slowly...just get the ball rolling, make poly-minded friends, stalk forums such as r/polyamory, do some research. I created an OKcupid profile to meet friends but instead met a beautiful, loving, like-minded, amazing lady. We all hit it off immediately so I thought, ""Why wait? Why not let things go with the flow?"" So far, things have gone much better than I could have imagined. Communication is key and we have been great at honesty. I thought there would be jealousy naturally but it is non-existent thus far. I had my soulmate on my right and my new lady on my left the last few nights. Getting cuddles, hugs, kisses, caresses, making out, hand holding...from both sides and the two dabbled in everything together as well. I actually caught myself putting their hands together and switching spots so they could cuddle closer. I felt like I was so very lucky to have two beautiful people (inside and out) near me that I wanted to share them with each other. I felt no jealousy but instead a sense of calm and appreciation when they touched. It was wonderful being able to get love from two sides and to be able to step back and watch a new love unfold before my eyes. A timid, shy, sweet new love from my husband to the new lady. It was heart melting. It was also great to be hot and heavy with the new lady knowing full well that my husband felt no jealousy afterward. He is happy that I'm happy. What a wonderful situation we stumbled into. I couldn't be happier with this newfound sharing of love. It felt so beautiful, natural, and peaceful to be surrounded by so much love.

So when we were offered the opportunity to develop our own site, these were our conditions:

* Like a bonobo troop, it needs to be a place where the **females feel safe and respected**. No abusive language or behavior will be tolerated.  It also needs to be a place that promotes sharing in a variety of ways: information, resources, advice and support.
* It’ll be **SFW**. You won’t have to worry about having the page open at work or at home. Erotic photos and language will be restricted to private areas. Nothing here will embarrass you with friends, kids, or colleagues.
* We’ll provide opportunities to KōTangle both online and off. We’ll sponsor ongoing **regional events** where members can meet in person and build their own networks.
* And finally, if the site eventually generates profits, a significant portion will go to making the world a little more accommodating for people like the ones in this community. We’ll support **women’s health initiatives, bonobo sanctuaries, support for LGBT kids, and other progressive, sex-positive initiatives**—with transparency and the participation of the community.”

Keep reading, because I promise this is a positive poly (triad) story.  

Our relationship was the first poly experience for any of us, and the first threesome my husband and I had ever had.  It was amazing.  The last three years have been incredible, beyond my dreams.  Integrating her into our lives, even though we live in different states, was one of the most challenging and ultimately fulfilling experiences of my entire life.  I have learned so much from being in a triad.  

I have learned what true love is.  I have learned that love is trust and honesty and communication.  I experienced compersion for the first time and was stunned at the love that I was capable of experiencing.  Seeing my husband with our gf made me indescribably happy.  I was completely taken off guard by how happy it made me to see them happy and loving with each other.  

Being in the triad helped me truly connect with and understand my bisexuality in a way that I never thought possible.  I thought being bisexual and married to a man meant the side of me that is attracted to women could never be fulfilled.  The last few years have made me see that I am truly blessed to have a partner who loves all of me and wants to see me happy and knows that who I sleep with has no impact on how much I love him.  

It is sad when a relationship ends, and I spent a few days crying and feeling ripped apart when the decision was made that we were going back to being best friends instead of a triad.  I hadn't gone through a break up in over 15 years, and the pain stunned me.  Then an amazing thing happened: I realized I had someone to lean on.  My husband has been my rock and my hiding place since the break up, even more so since he saw it coming and was less stunned/shocked than I was.  Though it is strange to not be a triad anymore, our marriage is stronger than it has ever been.  The sex is better than it has ever been.  I honestly cannot imagine anything that could break up my marriage now, and I know I would not feel that way had we not opened up our marriage to our ex-gf and had all the experiences we have had with her.  

Will we ever have another girlfriend?  I don't know.  I really hope so.   But we aren't rushing things.  It's just good to know that if and when the situation ever presents itself again, I know I can handle it and how wonderful it can be. 

TL; DR:  My triad just ended and my husband and I are back to just the two of us.  I'm grateful for our triad time and do not regret a thing.

I looked through his profile: We are an 82% match, he seems fairly intelligent and charming, we have similar interests, and his status was ""available,"" so I assumed he was also probably in some kind of open relationship. I agreed to go to dinner with him, but we didn't plan any specific day or time and we didn't exchange phone numbers or anything. 

Later on, I started looking through some of his compatibility answers and saw that they indicated that he was very okay with cheating and that his ideal mate would be also. I sent him a message that his answers raised a red flag for me. He responded by telling me that he was married and his wife did not know that he was on OKCupid. He said that I needed to be more clear about my intentions with others and I should change just about everything on my profile if I didn't want to be party to infidelity. He implied that if I wasn't okay with cheating, then I shouldn't be so promiscuous. He also tried to backtrack by saying that he never said anything about sex in his initial message and really just wanted an activity partner (I wonder what kinds of ""activities"" he had in mind!) and that I must have not actually read his message thoroughly enough.

*August 2010 - I fall in love with my wife's friend hardcore. I had my reasons. We both loved our spouses and didn't want to end our marriages. We just had this love out of no where that was crazy powerful. ie. Other people saw it.

* August 2010 - My wife and her husband find out. We told them. My wife and him start talking about what they are going to do. Each decides they are going to fight for us

* Sept 2010 - My wifes friend gets pregnant. No it's not mine. We refrained from having sex out of respect for our marriages.

* Sept 2010 --&gt; March 2010 - My relationship with my wife gets alot better. I start feeling a love for her I didn't have for a long time. Marriage is great. I still am in love with her friend and we share an occasional kiss.

* March 2010 - I tell the truth about the kisses. She flips out but realizes other than the lying, it didn't bother her.

* April 2010 - My wife tells me she loves him and is down with the whole poly idea. She said she was considering it for sometime.

* April 2010 - Jealousy starts for me bigtime. Really not a good time.

* June 2010 - Wife has sex with him for first time. Still not doing well but getting a grip on the jealousy. 

* July 2010 - My OSO has her baby.

* Last night - I made love to my OSO and it was amazing. Although we had to be careful because of her recently giving birth. Still it was an amazing experience

* Tonight - My wife is out with her husband and I am feeling great. I have gotten past my jealousy.

So my journey continues. I love two of the most beautiful and special women in the world. My wife encourages my relationship with her friend and they have grown to be like sisters more so than my wife's real sister. I fell like the luckiest man alive. I have never been, or would ever have been as close to my wife as we are now. Life is wonderful.

I found myself constantly fantasizing about other people outside of the monogamous relationship and often acted on those fantasies, which resulted in feelings of guilt for cheating on my partner. Yet I never saw that as wrong. Those guilty feelings came out of what I thought I was supposed to feel and then I would feel even worse for not initially feeling bad about it. I didn't know how to tell my partner that I felt trapped by our relationship and needed the freedom to express my love for others.
After taking a long break from being in any kind of relationship to try to figure out and think through what was going through my head, I met someone. This girl shares a lot of my interests and my sense of humor and is an ent (not a necessity but is sooo nice after dating a very judgmental anti-ent). I was trepidatious about getting involved with her due to past relationship failures, but had also learned that being up front about my feelings and expectations was integral to avoiding drama. While I don't know if she completely understands where I am coming from, she has been very chill and open-minded about it. I haven't yet come across anyone else who I would also want to date alongside her, so I don't really know how she would react to something like that, but my hopes are high. 
Anyway, (time for the lame, corny part) it's awesome to know that there are in fact other people out there who think like me and that I am not some inhuman monster incapable of love. I just love many people instead of one.

My roommate and very close friend and I were both poly. He got involved with a girl who was crazy about him, and monogamous, but he didn't want to be monogamous with her. It caused all kinds of strife and the relationship was screaming with suppressed communication, but the mutual resentment about the issue was so intense that neither of them were particularly constructive about it. Even still, they loved each other intensely. She had a serious drinking problem and since he also had a similar (though not as extreme) habit he let it slide, even though I (and I hope other friends as well) tried to alert him to the fact that their collective behavior and relationship dynamic seemed really unhealthy.

One night they went out drinking and came back to the house (where my roommate and I lived with 2 other friends), they went to the porch where she had a smoke, I guess she dropped a cig butt below the deck where it fell on an old mattress. Two hours later, at 2am, the house was in flames and all of us made it out... except her.

My friend immediately moved in with his ex and has been seeing her and another lady. It's been a month since the disaster. I haven't been terribly close with him because I'm shaken and angry and in such a vastly different place than he is, so it's really hard to relate to how he's managing his life. To me, it seems plain as day that the conflict in their relationship made worse all the factors that contributed to this tragedy. It also breaks my heart that they loved each other so much, but the little time they had together was already eroded by suppressed pain from their conflict over polyamory.

In my own life, a month before all this I'd just gotten out of a poly relationship where my partner was finding more ""success"" than I was, mostly because I was too focused on school and work to pursue other people, and I didn't really feel the desire to do so. I didn't feel like I was missing out on anything and when we broke up I didn't have a huge urge to pursue anyone, but fairly immediately I met someone really amazing. A week before the fire, we went on a first date, and I felt a huge shift - I was absolutely disinterested in pursuing anyone else, period. Shortly thereafter I cut things off with a long-time lover and didn't even bat an eye - my heart just wasn't in it. After the fire, my new beloved was incredible and supportive and the communication between us has been amazing. I still maintain that I don't want to make any monogamous agreements/assumptions in our relationship, and instead focus on communication and full disclosure, but I know my days of being polyamorous are over. 

It's hard to explain, but losing everything and seeing my friend's dysfunctional poly relationship has led me to see having additional partners as just being... extraneous. And I'm cutting all the fat from my life right now. My life is already so full with work, school, friends, and this new love, I just want to enjoy fewer things in my life in general. It's weird, it's like I'm intensely driven to minimalism in my general outlook, and polyamory conflicts with that need too much for me to continue identifying that way. I feel like my entire person has undergone a major shift and instead of clinging to the pieces of my old life I just need to shrug it off and move on.

My poly friends seem very confused by it, but I realize that it's just really hard to relate to the effects of such a massive destructive event.

Apologies for wall-o-text.

Warning: if you have weight issues, this post could make you think about them.

My husband and I are mildly poly or swing-y - not sure of the right word, but we occasionally participate in three- or foursomes. Most of the time I just want to be a couple, but it's fun to play with others every now and then.

When we go out on Friday nights (which we do pretty much every week), my husband seems to be always on the lookout for hot girls for us to sleep with. Ok, so he's a guy and a guy always has to be on the lookout because guys get turned down more often than not, right? Ok, fine. But the vast majority of these girls are hotter and thinner than me. And that makes me feel like he would really rather if I were hotter and thinner than I am. But I feel like I'm supposed to make approving noises about these girls, because looking at hot girls is ""something we have together"".

I am pretty - people get crushes on me - but I'm not drop-dead gorgeous, and I'm not thin. I could make a case for me being ""curvy"" - my hips and boobs are big and my waist is smaller in proportion to them. But I can't pretend I'm thin. I take size 16 pants, and my underwear size is XL.

I know my husband doesn't want me to be unhappy, and he doesn't want me to obsess about my body (at least I'm sure he doesn't want to hear about it). Maybe I should just try to get comfortable with the body I have? I'm learning to sew - hopefully soon I will be able to make awesome clothes that fit me really well. Is that enough?

Or maybe I should try to slim down. I took size 12 pants when I met him (almost a decade ago). Should I be trying to get back to that? Should I try to compete with these girls? I have never been sexy like they are anyway - they dress so skimpy and pose for the cameras in a way that just isn't me.

In fact I have already been trying to slim down - I've been trying to eat low-glycemic-index foods and avoid high-glycemic-index foods for about a year and a half now. Maybe it doesn't work or maybe I need to be stricter about it, but I'm the same size I was when I started. I may have gotten very slightly bigger. It's frustrating because I had high hopes for low-GI. I should get more exercise but I'm not sure how to work it into my life.

I have told my husband a few times that I noticed he pretty much only points out girls that are thinner than me. It doesn't seem to accomplish much other than making us both feel bad. One time he said that he thought looking at pretty girls was something we had together. It is! But it makes me feel bad when they are all thinner than me. One time he said it was because he already had me, so why would he need to look at other girls like me? But I don't believe he would stop looking at skinny girls if he were with a skinny girl, so I think he was just trying to say something that would sound comforting.

It makes it hard for me to be interested in having a threesome with another girl, because I feel like I will look unsexy by comparison. And I don't want to feel resentful and jealous. I want to feel like my husband really is happy with me - it's hard to want to bring someone else into the equation when I feel like my husband might wish I were thinner than I am. And that makes it worse, because one of the things he finds hot about me is that I do like to play with others on occasion.

On top of it all, my husband is a performer at the place where we go dancing, and so he gets a lot of attention from hot young things.

For now the agreement is that he will stay at home at night until the baby is born, and according to the agreement we already had at least the first few weeks after she is born as well, depending on how things go.

He will also make an effort to work even more from home so that he is here more time, even though he is working.

I am putting my foot down on this. Too bad if the baby still doesn't want to come out for another 4 or 5 weeks (I doubt it, but you never know). She can get over it. And so can he.
I actually doubt that she will have an issue with this, I think she understands and he is just trying to keep us all happy, which will never work.

I think I am being pretty decent in saying that she can be here if she wants to be with him, I won't tell them to stop seeing each other, as long as he is home before 12. If they use that time to have sex, have dinner, or do whatever is up to them. If she really just wants to be with him, she can get over the weirdness of all of us being together and come over and sleep here. I'll even sleep in the baby room (where we have an extra bed) so they can have the big bed together. 

I know that a lot of you say that he should ""man up"" and things like that, but that is exactly what he is trying to do, for both of us. He is not used to me needing him to this extend. I'm normally a fairly independent person, just hormones have really screwed me over and he has a hard time dealing with that (even without the other relationship added in). He feels very helpless to do anything...

There are some more talks that we are going to have to have in the future.

I don't want my baby to have a part time dad, nor do I want her to only see her mom and dad together for a few times a week. That's simply not an option for me, and he knows that. He just refuses to think about it until it is time. He's a bit of a ""it is not a problem yet, so lets not think about it"" type of guy, where as I prefer to have things clear and sorted beforehand, and be flexible if and when things change. I am also sure that I don't want her to mother my baby. She will be in her life of course, but more as an ""aunt"", when she happens to be with my husband as he is taking care of her. LOL; it is funny how protective I already feel about her, and how much I already feel like I will do anything for my baby to be happy and healthy :)

I also think I might have to talk to her about certain things. I have bend over backwards to give their relationship a chance, to help her feel comfortable, to include her in our lives... and I am getting nothing in return. I'm not asking for a threesome, or have her in love with me as well (she's not even my type). Just to be included at times. Invited along when they are doing something simple, like watching soccer in the afternoon. Or when they are going to the movies. Anything that suggests that she is aware that I need him as much, if not more, than she does. And that she is really willing to share, and not just pretend I don't exist. That hurts... but I guess that is something that will have to wait until after my baby is born. I don't feel mentally up for having that conversation with her now.

So, thank you all for your opinions.

Unfortunately, however, a certain male friend of mine seems to have it in his head that because I'm in a poly relationship - I'm going to sleep with him, just cos.
So far it's just been whining in Facebook messages about how he hasn't had sex in ages and how he ""'needs' friends with benefits ;)"". His goal seems to be to get pity sex. 

I'm not going to sleep with him because:

1. Whining for pity sex is really unattractive

2. I'm not physically attracted to the guy 

So i can't pull the, ""Mention partner"" trick and I really don't want to straight up say why, because he already has terrible self-esteem and I don't want to knock him for his looks if I can help it.

He's asked me to meet him for coffee tomorrow afternoon and I want to say something to get him to stop hinting - but I'm not sure what. 

Is there something I could say in passing that would let him know I'm not keen, without straight up saying, ""I don't find you attractive""?

Just for clarity, I'm currently hooking up with another close friend of mine as FWB(Realistically, it's more like dating - but FWB is what we're calling it) and the friend I'm meeting tomorrow knows about this.

For a few years now, however, I've fantasized -- both in the sexual and in the nonsexual sense -- about all sorts of situations that I guess are considered polyamorous. I like thinking about my wife enjoying herself with other men and women(!), and I like to think about myself enjoying myself with men(!) and women. (The ! is because I've never had a homosexual experience and am pretty happy considering myself straight. Except for the occasional gay sex and romance fantasies, of course.) It can be all of us together or just some of us separately; my fantasies don't appear to have any particular limits in that regard.

But, of course, real life has plenty of limits. I've had a couple of incomplete conversations with my wife about these  ideas, and the general sense I get is she thinks they might be nice fantasies but not something to do for real. 

And she's probably right. Not only do we have little kids and a really good ""conventional"" marriage thing going on, but she's prone to anxiety about trusting people and about diseases (all kinds, not just STDs). Both of us have had exactly one other earlier intercourse partner (I have done nonpenetrative things with two others.) So what business do I have even fantasizing about these things?

It's not even like I want to have some tripped-out porn-style orgy. I just want to make out and snuggle with one or two of a dozen of our (almost certainly all mono) friends and acquaintances. And I think I'd be really happy if she did the same. Then one thing can lead to another if it should.

I could certainly die happy not having anything outside of monogamous relationships. But I could have died happy never eating sushi, and I really like sushi.

My husband and I have been married for about five years. I deeply love my husband, but as I grow closer to my boyfriend I feel that I am distancing myself from my husband.

Help me determine this.


We meet. We get along. We go on a couple of dates. We have sex. He then reveals his interest in polyamory. I'm surprised, but I'm open minded and truth be told -- I've been exploring polyamory, too. He reveals he's dating ONE other person, who he says knows about me. I think about it. I say OK, let's date but I want the following: open communication and honesty. He says OK. I trust that OK. We have fun every time we see each other. Things went great for weeks after that.


Two months and a couple of weeks later, he goes on a trip. Comes back. Change is dramatic. He is distant.  He is cryptic.  He suddenly wants ""me time"". ""I need space,"" he says. ""But, I still adore you. We are fine 110%."" I feel iffy about it, but I choose to trust what he says. After all, work is important. So I give him space even though it was hard.  I may have acted needy with texts but then I really tried not to text/call him a lot, but something in my head kept saying, ""There's something amiss here.""  Anyway, I go on a few dates, but don't sleep with any of the men I date. I'm open to having sex with others, of course, but at the time I just didn't feel the right connection enough to go there. Besides, he and I had an agreement that if we do decide to sleep with other people -- for safety reasons -- we have to tell each other.  After all, this is DC. The capital of HIV in the United States, where 1 in every 20 adults IS HIV positive. Scary stuff.


Two weeks after he told me he needed space, he seems to be a bit better -- almost like how we used to be. Laughing, playing, having great sex. Then I ask him, ""Have you hooked up with anyone lately other than me and your other girl?"" He looks thoughtful and says, ""I met someone before I left on my trip but she just gave me a blowjob."" I say OK... but then I'm confused why he didn't choose to tell me. Then he says, ""I also fucked my roommate like a week ago. We fucked before but she needed some, and I wanted to be a good friend so I fucked her."" I go, OK... um... why didn't you tell me then? He says he's telling me now. He says it probably won't happen again. My head says oh it'll happen again. But I decide again, OK, I have to talk to him about safety issues. I know his sexual health (we've both been tested as well as the other girl) and as far as I knew it was just the three of us at this time... but now I don't know. I get nervous but he says he wants me to trust him.  I care about this guy so much, I tell myself OK.  But I also tell him I don't know the other people's sexual health and so he needs to be upfront with me. He says OK.


We spend the night. We have a great night. I start feeling like this could go back on track.... despite the blowjob and the roommate fuckage.  Silly, huh?


I go home. I have a good day at work. I come home early. On my way home, he drives by (he lives nearby) and next to him is a woman I don't recognize. He waves. Again, something amiss.  Did he look nervous?  


I text him, ""LOL! Is that (the other girl's name)?"" 


He texts back, ""That was actually (a friend of his from high school) she is visiting (from out of town) and is here (for four days)."" 


I text back, ""Oh, is that why you''re busy this weekend? "" trying to tease him. 


He texts: ""Yeah, we see each other once a year."" 


I ask him: ""Is she THAT type of friend... ie do you sleep together?"" 


He says: ""Yes, she is that type of friend. I would have told you but I didn't see the point in it. I am still trying to wrap my head about this whole disclosure thing mainly because I don't want to set that type of expectation."" 


Me: ""Not causing drama but I'm confused why you hadn't mentioned it to me last night that you were having a guest over, who obviously you would be having sex with. I thought we agreed to tell each other stuff like this?""


Him: ""We were close in high school. I guess I diddn't see a reason to tell you. I have no problem telling you shit ahead of time but not sure if we want to set that expectation.""


Me: I wish you had said something. I would have understood. Anyway, I don't want to spoil your weekend. All I am concerned about is safety obviously. I know you but I hope you understand that I don't know them and their health safety record. If you knew that I was sleeping with other guys you would want to know that they were safe too. You mentioned and stressed on that before. I am not mad. Just very confused.


Him: Definitely. I don't even know if we are having sex. We agreed to tell each other if we do for safety's sake and that's what I'm going to do. 


At this point, I'm looking at my phone going WTF? I am so confused... so I don't text. Mainly because I don't want to ruin his weekend ( I do care about him deeply and if he's happy then so be it ) but at the same time I am hurt and I am confused and now I am also scared for my health. Do I get myself checked again?


He texts again: Are you OK?


I respond. I am. 


That wasn't a lie. I am OK. I just wish he would have told me.


My questions are:


Am I wrong for thinking I've been duped? 


He is slowly sounding like he keeps things secret from me. If he hadn't driven past and me seeing him with a passenger, I wouldn't have known she was even visiting.


Is he polyamorous or just someone who is 23 years old, having his cake and eating it too? Sometimes I wonder if there are men who just hide behind polyamory to screw around. I may or may have one in my hands.


I'd love your view points.


Thank you.



UPDATE:

So, last night, I see him and his highschool friend at the bar where we met exactly three months ago.

Long story short, and loaded with liquid courage, I came up to him and asked if we could talk. She comes, too.

I ask him why he didn't tell me she was coming for the weekend. He says I'm being confrontational, which I was... and I know in hindsight I shouldn't have been... but she stops him and says, ""Let her finish.""

I tell him I would have understood and wished them both a good weekend if he had the courtesy of telling me. ""I spent the night with you the day before she arrived and you didn't feel like you had to tell me?"" I ask.  He said he didn't' see a point to telling me because he wasn't even sure if they were having sex. I laugh. I tell them both, ""If you're sleeping in the same bed... you're having sex."" His friend actually smiles and nods yes. If circumstances were different, I would have loved to befriend this girl.. she was really nice. She looks at him and asks, ""Why didn't you tell her? It's a big deal for someone to come over and spend the weekend with you."" He mumbles something I don't comprehend.

I tell him I'm done. I tell her thank you for understanding. After all, this isn't her fault. I feel like crying, she hugs me. She said she will talk to him when he is sober but that she understood where I was coming from. I say goodbye.

I am in a MFF ""triad"" closed relationship.  All three of us never expected this to happen and the two females are virtually only attracted to each other and not other women which kind of led to this.

I married my high school sweetheart and been together for 6yrs and this year she finally came out to her long time best friend that she is sexually attracted to her.  And well her friend has always shared those feelings but they never told each other.

I have always known my wife was into her and we roleplayed stuff before dealing with it, so it was no shock to me.  It was so wonderful seeing how happy my wife was knowing her best friend shared the same feelings for her all along.

I never really communicated with her best friend because she moved to other side of country when they were still in school so we started to txt and then Skype with each other getting to know each other.  Well we ended up becoming really deep friends as well and then talks started about all three of us being together and happy.

I am really sorry if I got off-topic but I have never told anyone our story before and it felt really nice getting it off my chest and finally be able to be happy and out about it with others.

I know it sounds ridiculous, but I've never met someone so perfect for me in my entire life. I've been in love so many times, but he makes me feel like I never really knew what being ""in love"" really meant until now. We lift each other up, push each other forward, and speed up each other's evolution on a level I have only dreamed about until now, and it's fucking awesome.

It's also my first truly poly relationship. I've always thought it was a good idea, because I am a lover and it's important to me to be able to share my love freely. I'm also highly sexual; I enjoy flirting with and seducing the world around me. Of course he understands this about me and supports it whole heartedly. He enjoys seducing the world along with me! However, I am experiencing a strange new phenomena in this relationship: despite being free to be intimate with anyone I want, I find myself NOT wanting to be too intimate with anyone else because he satisfies me so deeply and I would rather save that time for him. There is so much I want to do with him, accomplish, and create that I can't imagine entangling myself with others in the same way. It's funny, because I never felt this in any of my monogamous relationships. I was only monogamous because I felt obligated to. In this case monogamy just seems to be a natural result of my feelings. Also I find that I want to share everyone I love with him and I want to feel love for those people he loves as well. I have no desire for anything separate!

So have any of you in poly relationships ever felt this way before, or is the need to sex up as many people as you can something that never changes? Is it possible that monogomy and polyamory can overlap? I'd really like feedback and to hear about your experiences. Thank you!

So I built a Chrome plugin a while back to reveal whether profiles had favorable or unfavorable answers to the non-monogamy questions. I've been using it for a few months, and loving how much easier it is to use OkC as a polyamorous person. I was planning to rebuild it properly, but after months of procrastination, I decided to tidy up the current version and release it now.

So, anybody want to beta test this thing? PM me with an email address and I'll send you a link! (I won't add you to any mailing list or anything, but I'll email you in a week or so to ask if you have any feedback before I release it more publicly.)

Thanks!

I was mildly appalled and made it clear that it would never ever ever nuh uh, no way, happen. 

Eventually, I started thinking about it and warmed to the idea. We started easing into it this past summer with a friend of his, hit a few glitches, had a few fights, a handful of meltdowns on my part, and then decided to try out a threesome, which was an absolute blast.

Since then we've decided to try full openness, and have been doing the dating site thing for a bit, with no real success.

However, we recently met a couple and have been having so much fun hanging out and seeing what happens. Watching my boy flirt with another boy is ridiculously adorable, and getting to know someone and see where it goes without all these solid boundaries is so exciting.

There's no real point to this except that I just wanted to share that I'm really enjoying trying this, and while I know that it won't always be rainbows and butterflies, this has opened up some amazing new experiences and it's so incredible to me that this can bring so much happiness!

As I mentioned in this [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/o4hlg/experiencing_weird_reactions_to_coming_out/), we have a problem in which explaining our open relationship is seen as an invitation for overt sexual advances from *everyone* including some of our closest friends.

After a few trials and much error, we had already decided that sleeping with friends is permanently off the table if we want to have normal and happy social lives, and we tell them as much. Now, it seems clear that even telling our friends about the structure of our relationship is slowly eroding our social group. Thus, we've decided that we will only tell people about our poly lifestyle if we are genuinely interested in fucking them.

I used to think that by being open we would increase the acceptance of polyamory. Now I'm afraid that the problems that honesty creates are too great for us to handle.

Dear Abby treats us like normals, almost. How to promote a poly event in the mainstream media with brains and cute overload. Obliterating a clueless mental-health professional. TV done right. Next-generation voices, teenage and up. And, “with their heads on their shoulders, they create their own identity using tools 2.0.” (That’s supposed to be us.)

If you haven't kept up with Polyamory in the News (http://polyinthemedia.blogspot.com) in the last three months, here is some of what you missed:

--------------------

● Dear Abby, the world’s most widely syndicated newspaper columnist, takes a straightforward approach to a triad’s question about coming out to family:

http://polyinthemedia.blogspot.com/2011/08/dear-abby-should-triad-come-out-to.html

.

● Public TV tells our story beautifully &amp;#151; in Germany. You won’t see a documentary like this on timid, un-free PBS quite yet:

http://polyinthemedia.blogspot.com/2011/08/german-public-tv-tells-our-story.html

.

● An elderly poly couple from that documentary ventures onstage to discuss their lives and explain their philosophy for a solid 30 minutes on a top-rated German TV talk show:

http://polyinthemedia.blogspot.com/2011/09/germany-culture-evolution-by-mainstream.html

.
 
● “Monogamish.” There’s been a boomlet of media attention to what gay culture, and many gay marriages, can teach the straight world about tailoring some negotiated non-monogamy into committed relationships. Now two leading gay/lesbian publications, &lt;i&gt;The Advocate&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Autostraddle,&lt;/i&gt; pile in. “Gay Marriage Doesn’t Change Straight Marriage… Except When It Does.” The slippery slope is here. Or… is it actually a stairway up?

http://polyinthemedia.blogspot.com/2011/08/monogamish.html 

.
 
● “No flowers in the hair or colorful robes: these are men and women of their times. They are architects, managers, cooks, teachers. With their heads on their shoulders, they create their own identity using tools 2.0,” burbles France’s largest newsweekly magazine&lt;/a&gt;. “The 21st century will be one of ‘multiple love, polyunion, polyfidelity, polyamory,’ Jacques Attali prophesied…. And if he's right?”

http://polyinthemedia.blogspot.com/2011/08/poly-movement-in-france-taking-hold.html

.
 
● The Polyday organizers in London promoted their event with wit and cute overload in the newspaper and "" on TV in the week beforehand. This is how it’s done, folks.

http://polyinthemedia.blogspot.com/2011/08/polyday-organizers-debate-tv-talk-show.html

.
  
● The “Sister Wives” family challenges anti-polygamy laws. Why this matters to poly&lt;i&gt;amorists,&lt;/i&gt; and why the polygamists could actually win this time. A case to watch in coming months and years:

http://polyinthemedia.blogspot.com/2011/07/sister-wives-stars-challenge-anti.html

.
 
● When a &lt;i&gt;Psychology Today&lt;/i&gt; therapist-blogger opined about “Why ‘Open’ Marriages Don’t Work,” she didn’t realize the buzz saw she was backing into. We sure can mobilize. Did we overdo it?

http://polyinthemedia.blogspot.com/2011/08/why-open-marriages-dont-work.html

.
 
● Getting serious for a bit: “The future of our defining word,” and what you can do about it.

http://polyinthemedia.blogspot.com/2011/09/future-of-our-defining-word.html

.
 
● Some Next Generation voices, teen and up:

● And more.

My problem is, Matt is frustrated and struggling with being supportive.  His attitude is basically, ""I'm still here, I didn't hurt you, so be happy when you're with me.""  Matt and Ben were very different men, and never close friends, so Matt is not (outwardly) doing any grieving of his own.

I don't know what to do.  Logically, I can understand Matt, and how he doesn't want to be responsible for ""picking up the mess.""  But my emotions aren't logical.  I can't just turn off my feelings of loss over Ben, simply because I'm sitting next to Matt.

Girlfriend and I have been having some very frank, and open conversations with our spouses about how we feel about each other, and where we see this going between us. During all these talks the last few weeks my wife started getting more distant from me. We still hung out, and talked and had a good time together but the romantic part wasn't there.

We've been open/poly now going on three years. She had always had poly relationships before we met, and I was her first monogamous relationship she had. We were monogamous for 7 years before she started to show interest in other people, and I have always been open minded and let her have her fun. I did a little flirting here or there but never felt a serious connection with anyone so for a long time it was just her having fun while I kept to being home or just with friends.

So fast forward to now and I've found in someone what I can best describe as my soul mate. From the moment we started to fall in love it wasn't like we were learning to love, but more like we were remembering how too all over again. I'm a pretty firm non-believer/Atheist but for the first time I'm feeling like I've known this girl before like in a past life sort of known her.

I talked to my wife this morning, and she flat out said she wasn't poly. Even when she was romantic with other people they were her sole romantic interest. Even though she was with me the whole time her romantic/love interests were just shifted from me to that other person, and not in a poly/sharing kind of way. Over the past year and half when I finally met some people and started to have love interests she has been trying to have me be her sole love/romantic interest and could not handle sharing me at all. So now I am in love, real soul touching love and she can't handle it and is pulling away to distance herself because she doesn't have someone else right now.

So we're still going to be life partners. We have kids, a life and home to share together. We're working on getting our friendship back, and being able to have that open connection again. My secondary has now become my primary love/emotional/physical source and when I told her that she already knew it and wants to be that for me.

TLDR:
Wife said she was poly for years, ends up not being poly when it's too late and I am finally in love with someone else. Now we're friends.

We've had our ups and downs, and we've suffered sometimes, and we've been blissfully happy a lot of the time.  We've had our problems, and we've worked them out like adults, and so I feel very comfortable describing both our relationship and lifestyle as ""successful"".

My buddy G lives with us.  He's also my wifes boyfriend.  We still have no idea how to refer to one another using the standard relationship words, but these adjectives will do fine for now.

My girlfriend lives 3 hours away.  We don't see each other that often, but we're all real poly... we all share a bit of love that has nothing to do with sex.  The girlfriend lives with her family, and her family sucks.  They have been abusive assholes pretty much their entire lives, and my girlfriend is pretty much the abuse dumpster because she is simply too nice.  It doesn't help that she is too smart for her family, and it doesn't help that her relationship status is too strange for her family.  It especially doesn't help that she has medical problems and the abuse has escalated to physical abuse.

Well, I have a REAL family, and we all adore her.  So, we're getting her out of that abusive household.  I'm not going to leave you all with some sob story about how life sucks...  My family and I fix problems.  It's going to be tough.  For too many reasons to list, the best solution is that she and I live in the master bedroom, and my wife goes to G's bedroom.  He works in a travelling job so he's out of town monday through friday.  This way I can still ""be"" with my wife even though we'll all be jumping beds throughout the week...  Yeah, weird, but it should work.  We're putting ourselves into a bit more stress for what we all believe to be the greater good...

Were you waiting for the ""but"" part to the story?  Here you go;

It is the strangest sensation.  My wife and I are moving her stuff out of ""our"" bedroom.

We know that nothing is changing between us.  Heck, our work separates us all the time and the greatest feeling is seeing your love after you've been apart for two weeks.  It's just that, as we move things... we've both had split ups in the past, and moving things is pretty much the penultimate part of splitting up.  Knowing something in your head is different from knowing something in your heart and we've had our little crying moments where we remind ourselves that nothing is really changing.

So, we ""get it"" with the strange feelings.  It helps that we've got a good understanding of our emotions.  Emotions are tricky things and as a poly I have learned long ago to simply feel them, and explore the feeling.  Sometimes you must simply learn to enjoy the feeling for what it is and use it to reaffirm the love you share...

It's going to be so nice.  My girlfriend can finally live with an accepting and loving family.  Right now though, my wife just moved her make up table out of the bedroom, and I wanna have a little cry over that...

My girlfriend of 2 years recently told me that she is polyamorous and wants to have an open relationship. I am uninterested in open relationships and the polyamorous lifestyle, and told her that. She stated that polyamory was part of who she was as a person, and that an open relationship was important to her. The conversation ended when I said that I would think on this issue.

After thinking about it for a few days, I told her that I wanted to talk about it again. I reiterated that I did not want an open relationship, and that maybe we should break up so that we can pursue other opportunities. She panicked a bit, and quickly told me that she ""could be monogamous"" for me, that being with me was more important than being in an open relationship.

This has left me somewhat nervous. I am not polyamorous, and I know how important a monogamous relationship is to me. I want to know how important being able to pursue a polyamorous lifestyle is to you.

I mainly ask because I don't want us to stay together if it means that she's going to grow resentful of not being able/allowed* to have romantic relationships with other people. If that's going to happen, we may as well end the relationship now and avoid all the pain.

Thank you in advance for your help in this.

She was venting over her asshat of a boyfriend who doesn't pay much if any attention to her, and angry because I am just so happy in my relationship (neither of us is dating anyone else at this time, but we do have BDSM-type play partners). We are safe, we've both been tested (and do so every 6 months), and have very strong communication skills - things she and her SO do not have. 

Lately she's made comments about fat people (I'm a size 20/22) and how gross the idea of them having sex is. Her exact text: ""behind 2 really fat people in their 60s buying 2 giant tubes of astroglide... guhhhhhhh."" To which I replied: ""Sounds like last weekend"" as I had just been to a Munch &amp; after party. I can't be judgmental when I'm a biggie and most of the other people there are too (at least I try not to be).

She's not happy within herself and so she feels the need to bag on everyone else, and I'm just tired of it. I want to be her friend, but I want the nice &amp; fun girl I met before she turned into a needy, whiny, witch with this asshat SO. 

I came here because you all have such great info/talking points with other posts. I just need help finding the right words. I'm tired of feeling like she thinks I'm a whore. I'm not. I have permission from myself and my fiancee to play/sex/love whomever I want; I know where my heart finds its home and he's in the next room playing Skyrim. Thanks in advance. 

**ADD-ON:** Thanks everyone for their input. I needed some good talking points and I think I have them now. I just wasn't sure how to go about it, find my words so to speak. I appreciate your help.

**UPDATE:** I messaged her telling her to please stop slut/sex/fat shaming me and that I wanted my old friend and her angry response was that (out of jealousy that I've apologized for repeatedly) I was mean to her when we first met.

Now, for some background, I consider myself a mostly-straight male, but I've been with guys before. As far as I know, she's straight, and this guy we know is pretty openly bisexual. I'm not really sure how to go about this: we've both been flirting with him for a while now, and recently she suggested... ah, asking him to be part of our relationship.

Now that I think about it, all three of us are actually pretty compatible emotionally, and on top of that he is pretty attractive.

Now, I had no idea people actually did this kind of thing, and I have no idea how it's going to work out. In my mind, this is probably going to end in someone getting hurt. Wise denizens of r/polyamory, what should I do? I feel this could be a unique experience, but I'm afraid of one or all three of us getting hurt.

We met a married couple, Tammy and Aaron, about a year ago at a party through mutual friends. We ran into them at other parties over the year. At a party in January I began to notice Aaron's incredible flirting skills and the way Tammy simply did not care about his flirting. After a somewhat flirty conversation I jokingly asked if they were swingers (forgive me, for I knew not what I did!). He smiled and said, ""something like that.""

In March we ran into them again at a party. Our friends tend to be very flirty and touchy anyway, so when I again found myself talking to Aaron, no one found it odd when he started to massage my shoulders and back. It felt wonderful, and the alcohol did not help me keep quiet about that fact. After a while of rubbing and talking, he simply asked me if I wanted to go make-out.

Now, up to this point my husband and I had participated in strip games with friends and truth or dare type games that always ended with me making out with another girl, but we had never discussed the possibility of making out with other people at parties. I knew I was interested in making out with Aaron, but I obviously needed to know what my husband thought of that idea. So I said, ""Let me ask David."" Aaron said he would go get Tammy, and we could all have fun.

So I went to my husband. ""Tammy and Aaron want to make out with us. You interested?"" ""Uh, sure!"" So we did. It was fun. It was incredibly different. It was exciting. Hands began to stray, lifting my shirt. Well that's okay. I like that. David noticed and took it as an invitation to do the same. A hand began to drift toward my pants. No, not okay. I touched his hand, and he stopped. No words needed. But then it was Tammy's turn on Rock Band, so she left.

Aaron walked away for a moment, so I kissed my husband. There are the lips I know! While we kissed, Aaron came up behind me and kissed on my neck. Two guys? I really like this! But soon we were done and back to the party.

The next morning, my husband and I got in our car and headed home. We talked about what happened. We both enjoyed it, but what are our boundaries now? Are we able to make out with others now? Just at parties? Just when we're both there? We also found FB messages from Aaron and Tammy. They had fun too! We should all hang out more. Go on a double date or something. We decided to give them our phone numbers so we can plan fun things to do as friends. Little did we know that the next 2 weeks would be a crash course on polyamorous living. We were both very interested in their lifestyle, even though it was obviously not for us. For one thing, we are way to jealous to ever try that!

But we liked our new friends, so we learned all about them and made plans to go see Twisted Theater (hilarious plays adapted from movies put on by drag queens). It's great to find someone else who likes those shows!

As one might expect, our text conversations became increasingly flirty. Sometimes we had to check in with each other and make sure these types of conversations were okay. We decide it's just texts; no harm there. As the double date drew nearer, my husband and I discussed these ideas that Tammy and Aaron had been putting in our heads. They kind of made sense, but we're fine the way things are. But maybe we should invite them to stay over after the show. They can stay in the guest room, and we can all hang out longer. A few nights later we discussed how it would be okay if we all kissed and played around a little bit, nothing serious. Yeah that sounds okay.

Finally, the long awaited double date was here. We went to dinner. I sat next to Aaron, and David sat next to Tammy. There was a similar arrangement at the show. Then it was the car ride to our place. Tammy and I sat in the backseat. After awhile, Tammy started to caress my arm. I know that Tammy was bi, but I am not. I mean, sure, I make out with girls sometimes, but that's all... That sounds like fun actually. Tammy and I touched and kissed, stopping every so often to remind someone to keep his eyes on the road. We pulled up to the house.

Inside we got everyone some drinks and settled into the couches. I liked sitting next to Aaron. David seemed to be enjoying being next to Tammy. They had brought a game for us to play called “The Game.” It's like a sexy truth or dare game with the top cards being full on sex. We stuck to the lower cards at first. Kissing, dancing, massaging, touching. But then we got into the higher point cards. Are blowjobs okay? Sure, why not. Then everyone was definitely ready for more. We really should have come to a solid decision on how far we should go. David looked to me, ""I'm for it. What do you say?""

All four of us fit easily on our king size bed. What is Aaron doing? David never does it like that. Do I like it. Yes, I do. I really do! I see my husband with another woman. Wow he's sexy. I don't feel upset at this at all. It's pretty cool! Tammy and David finished, and so did Aaron. I'm always a little more difficult to please. The three of them worked together so nicely to get me there. David knew the special trick and he didn't hesitate to show it. Finally, I was there too.

We all cleaned up, then David cuddled Tammy, and Aaron cuddled me. The bed is plenty big enough. But cuddles quickly started to seem more like round 2 for us. Out of consideration for Tammy and David, we moved to the guest room.

That was a wonderful night for all four of us. David and I decided to give poly a shot. We talked about it, our feelings, our worries, our boundaries almost exclusively for many days. Soon Aaron was my boyfriend. And for the very first time last night I told my husband that I was in love with another man, and that Aaron loves me too! My wonderful husband was able to smile and be happy for me. I couldn’t be happier right now.

My entire adult life, I've been in open/non-monogamous relationships. I really loved not feeling limited or trapped by my relationship status. Yay freedom! It was never difficult for me, compersion came easy. ""Yeah sure, baby. Go have your fun! I'll see you next week"".


Then I fell in love. Actual ""I want you desperately in all the ways possible"" love. I very well may spend the rest of my life with this man. He was monogamous. I told him off the bat that I was not, but I'd work with him until he was comfortable enough to explore with me.


A year passes, we talk and talk and talk some more. We tried out swinging, threesomes, and all sorts of physical debauchery. He got his first taste of compersion and it was AMAZING. We had never felt so happy and in love and connected.


Things were progressing beautifully. Then it dawned on me. I knew someone that was PERFECT for him. I had a close friend (that he'd never met) that had a ridiculous amount of similar interests, loves and respects the hell out of me, and has been poly for a decade or so. She's married, has severe schedule limitations, and all sorts of safety guards to make sure things don't progress too quickly.


I introduced them. They hit it off instantly. Before I know it, they're talking all day every day. He's baring his soul and talking about all sorts of really intimate topics. He's giddy and drowning in NRE.



I freaked. The fuck. Out.



Something I didn't consider... I wasn't in love with my past boyfriends. I cared about them, but there was no real, deep, emotional investment there. As someone with severe intimacy issues, to actually use the ""L"" word and mean it with every fiber of my being is a HUGE deal.


So while I thought I was in the clear and everything was golden... I was actually back at square one and didn't realize it.


Mistakes were made. Trust was broken. Miscommunications occurred. Now I'm struggling to get past this huge beast of negativity. It's difficult. I'm drowning. Logically, I know everything is ok. Logically, I know she's good for him. Emotionally? The sky is falling. I've never felt so conflicted.

So I wanted to update! :) Things are going well, and hubby has met someone at his fire-spinning meetup. He has brought her home twice now so that she can hang out. Before he brought her over, they had been talking about polyamory for a few days. Now, every Friday for the last two Fridays (and apparently every Friday in the future) she has been coming over after the fire-spinning and hanging out. 

The first Friday it was pretty obvious that she didn't quite know what to think of me, or if the polyamory was a joke. She didn't ask questions, and I didn't push her. Their relationship is none of my business (in the sense that I'm not going to push/delve/and overwhelm them) and if something big comes up, I know my husband will let me know. I basically kept our conversation nice and light, and tried to stay out of their hair.

Now last night she came over and I could tell she was much more comfortable, but still a bit apprehensive. The two watched movies while I finished picking up the house. After a little bit, she relaxed and lied on his lap while he stroked her back. I didn't feel a twinge of jealousy; it was rather adorable! Again, I tried my best to stay out of their hair and show her I was more than okay with their relationship: I made them popcorn, acted like a good host, and then even took a nice, long, overdue shower (I had the baby all day and needed the break!) after my daughter had been put to bed.

My hubby did try to include me, which I noticed made her unsure. He kept asking me to sit with them on the couch, and she would immediately get off of his lap if I sat down. Not in a 'omg I can't believe she's intervening!' but more like 'is she going to hit me now?'. So I sat on our other couch and politely declined, spouting that this was their time and I was just watching the movie.

Now, I know you all are probably thinking I shouldn't have been there at all (maybe?) because that's how I felt, but both Friday's had been spontaneous things where hubby calls ten minutes before to see if she can come over. I absolutely hate it when people come over when the house isn't clean (Friday's are my cleaning days, since it's the only day I have off) and he knows it, lol. Now that I know she'll be over on Fridays, I might try to figure out what I can do. She always comes over very late though (passed ten PM), so there really isn't much to do with our daughter at that point. Besides, she seems to want to get to know me due to our conversation last night, so maybe me being there will eventually not be so bad for her.

Sorry this is so long! I'm just excited for him and wanted to share. :) Any advice as this continues?

A little background, I'm in a LTR with my bf (9 years) and while he and I know we are gonna be together till the end of time, we've never really had the impetus to get married. Enter my gf (she's a redditor and has posted her before) we've been together for almost a year, and I cannot see living without her, neither can the bf. 

So we want to have a ceremony or something to bind us all together and allow the families to meet, if they want. In effect it's a wedding, though no legalities will be performed. We are thinking a handfasting (akin to the Doctor and River Song, cause you know whovians). 

Here's what I come to you all for, how do we present this to the families? For all intents and purposes, we are out to them, so there is no going back into the closet. 

And do any of you have any links or resources about anything like this? I've looked but could really use some help, with planning, and all that.

So my friend and I, who are both engaged to men, have been fuck-buddies for close to a year now.  Both of our primaries are pretty cool about it, they've even joined in separately from time to time, but we've all been pretty set in a ""it's just sex"" kind of place.  

But this morning she suggested her and I go on an actual date soon and see about being girlfriends and I agreed.  When we got together we were both pretty insistent that we were monogamish and not poly, but now it feels like we're moving more into relationship territory and not just sex.

Strangely, this feels totally natural to me.  The thought of moving into a quad of some kind is uncharted territory, but pretty exciting.  Part of me worries about the logistics of it: kids, family members, parents, society, etc.  But mostly I'm just excited and trying not to think too far into the future.

I openly flirted with her on Saturday night (pretending to be more drunk than I really was, so if she didn't respond I could blame the whiskey) and she kissed me for the first time since November.
  
Then at a party on Sunday, she invited her new partner and after everyone else left and kids were in bed, we ended up hanging out as two couples snuggling and playing cards. I think it really helped her new partner feel more comfortable not being the only ""other"" there, and hopefully helped my BF handle this new situation better as well.

Sex has always been an issue in our relationship and I've always wanted it more than my wife and she just claimed she has a lower libido.  When we began the open relationship every encounter with another person served to fuel the fire we had for each other so we thought we had found something that worked for us.  

My wife now has a new boyfriend, they've been seeing each other for about three months.  They have sex multiple times a day.  They work closely together and are often alone together.  My wife hasn't wanted sex that much with me since we first started dating 8 years ago.  She now says that she doesn't have a low libido she just doesn't desire me because it's not new and exciting.  

I get that sex can get stale in a long term relationship but I've never felt a loss of desire for my wife.  We have a drawer full of various sex toys that I try to incorporate in different ways and I'm always looking for new things to try with her. I thought that by having the open relationship those desires for newness can be fulfilled and it would only strengthen our relationship.  Instead it's turned into a lot of resentment that my wife doesn't want to be physical with me when I want to so badly, when she's clearly capable having the frequency of sex that would make me ecstatic.  We've been to relationship therapists and have tried everything we can think of to spark her interest in me but there's been no solution. I can't handle her being that sexually active and completely shutting me down when I try to initiate.  It also doesn't help I haven't been as successful in finding additional partners.  I've had two very short relationships with others in the past two years so my wife feels a lot of pressure regarding sex since I haven't had much luck on my own.

**1) Feel Jealous When You Feel Jealous**

view jealousy as a natural and neutral emotion, just like any other emotion. don’t minimize your own experience of feeling jealous, but do take time to explore what fears or insecurities may be underpinning the jealousy. i sometimes hear poly people saying that jealousy is bad or that jealousy is all in your head or not really a valid emotion, but that’s crap! all feelings are valid, including jealousy. it’s what you DO with those feelings that really counts. which leads us to…

**2) Own Your Feelings**
(yes, this is about communicating and “i” statements and all that good stuff.)

take ownership of your feelings (by talking about and/or working through them honestly) and do NOT use your emotions to control or manipulate others’ behaviour. owning our feelings doesn’t mean excusing someone else’s actions that may have contributed to our feelings; it DOES mean reacting to our feelings with agency and without intent to harm in return.

i like using the analogy of punching to understand how owning feelings works. for example, say a friend punches you moderately hard in the arm while joking around (i.e. she didn’t mean to hurt you)… you have a lot of choices about how to react in this situation. some options might be:

a) you could punch her back, maybe even harder than she punched you.
b) you could say, “ow. it hurts when you punch me, please don’t do that again.”
c) you could say nothing, pretending your arm is just fine. and then you could say nothing the next time she does it, and the next, and the next…
d) you could say nothing and avoid that friend from now on.
e) you could yell, “WHY THE HELL DID YOU DO THAT, YOU IDIOT?”
f) you could scrunch up your face and whimper, “owie.”
g) you could say, “ow. it hurts my arm when you punch me, so could you please not do that again? it also reminds me of some times in my life when i really didn’t have a say over what happened to my body and i know you didn’t intend this, but it makes me feel really vulnerable and unsafe.”

Some of these options, like a, b, e, and f are ways of expressing your feelings around being punched. A couple of those reactions are certainly intended to cause harm in return (a and e), which is normally something we want to avoid. An exception would be if, say, your friend kept punching you, over and over - when we’re being abused like this, any reaction in self-defense is okay, and depending on the situation, could actually be the best option available.

f might be an automatic reaction (sometimes we respond to things in childlike ways because they bring up feelings from childhood or because we haven’t developed a grown up way of dealing with them), or it could be used to manipulate the punchy friend into feeling guilty. When we try to use our emotions to force someone to act a certain way, like feeling guilty or apologizing, we are falling into passive-aggressive behaviours that can really damage relationships over time.

c and d are avoidance tactics. it’s okay to avoid things sometimes. maybe this was a one-time thing, your friend got a little carried away and it won’t happen again. maybe you don’t feel safe speaking up for whatever reason. maybe there are other people around and you don’t know how to react in front of a group.

b is really straightforward and assertive… if your friend is a decent person, it will certainly ensure that they don’t punch you again. if the only issue is that being punched physically hurt, and you don’t want them to do it again, this is a great option…

But often we have other reasons for not wanting to be treated a certain way. If punchy friend isn’t really a close friend, they don’t necessarily need to know those reasons. But if she’s a close friend, or you’d like her to be, you might want to explain where your feelings are coming from, like in g. You’re not saying she caused you to feel them, though in a way she did by creating the environment in which they surfaced, but you are owning your own feelings and asserting how you would like &amp; deserve to be treated.

**3) Cut The Crap**

minimize or limit your exposure to mainstream media (and when you do watch it, do so critically). surround yourself with representations of diverse people, relationships, families, sexualities, and cultures. almost everyone tends to think they are the exception to having their attitudes and beliefs shaped by media… but trust me, there’s no such thing as being immune to cultural influences. the trick is to be aware of how you are affected and to actively &amp; intentionally work against that.

**4) Do What You Love**

*Spend your days doing what you love and love, it seems, comes easily.* ~Meg Hutchinson

everyone needs to take time for themselves. for basic self-care that keeps us healthy and functioning, yes… but also for the crucial aspect of maintaining a sense of self and having independent thoughts, choices, preferences, and dreams. for some people, self-care might include connecting with others, but this particular stuff, the stuff that makes us US, are things that happen when we are alone and taking time to dream and reflect.",,False,self,t5_2qu5n,False,,,True,t3_zq03k,http://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/zq03k/poly_tips_that_work_for_all_kinds_of_nonpoly/,

My favorite tea place is this little tea shop in downtown Portland, and I go there with my girlfriend Jen often enough that they recognize us as a couple.

The first time I took my girlfriend Ellie to the tea shop, we were all snuggled up and cute and kissing every now and again; it was clear that her and I were a couple. I got a quizzical look or two, but the girl working the register mostly smiled at us.

The next day, Ellie and I go back and we're meeting a girl I'm dating, Suzanne. Ellie and I get there first, then Suzanne arrives when Ellie was in the bathroom. I leap up and give Suzanne a big hug and kiss, then she snuggles up to me. Ellie gets back and is excited to see Suzanne, and snuggles up to the other side of me.

At this point the poor people working at the shop cannot figure out what is going on at all.

We have a really nice time, and it's pretty clear I'm with both of them. When we all go to leave, I go up to the counter and look through the menu. I'm asked ""Do you know what you'd like to order?""

I say ""Give me a sec, I'm going to bring something home to my girlfriend and I'm trying to figure out exactly what she likes""

My husband, myself, and my boyfriend live together.  My husband and boyfriend used to date also, but are now more like roommates than anything.  My husband is bipolar, so it's hard for him to maintain connections with people, if that's necessary to know.  I also have a FWB and my husband and I share a girlfriend.

My boyfriend happens to be my Dom.  He and I have an amazing sex life, full of our mutual kinks.  My husband is, and always has been, very vanilla.  I personally don't really enjoy vanilla sex as much...  I like the connection with my husband and don't feel I have to climax for it to be fun, but he thinks that if I'm not super into it that it's not worth it and it puts him off.  He also isn't into doing it really rough, saying sexy things, etc.  He really does like plain ol' sex.  Any suggestions I made to compromise were shot down because he just doesn't like them (they make him uncomfortable/feel awkward) and neither of us will enjoy it if someone is forcing it.  My husband does however have good sex with our girlfriend, who is into both vanilla and kinky sex, and since they started to date he has definitely had much more sex with her than with myself.

We agreed to take a break from sex for an undetermined amount of time.  I made sure he knew it wasn't all about the sex for me to love him and that I love him intellectually, which he agreed he realizes and says he is still glad we are married.  Him and I definitely talk about a lot more crazy, deep things than I tend to with my boyfriend, and the same goes for him and his girlfriend (they don't talk as much).

I guess I'm just sharing and opening discussion...  Anybody else out there maintain a partner/spouse that they aren't sexual with?  Did you try anything else in your journey to a non-sexual relationship?  Do you feel it's more possible to maintain such a relationship because you have other relationships filling your other needs?

Don't get me wrong, I'm not unhappy with this.  It's different, sure, but I very much am satisfied having multiple partners with multiple qualities and quirks.  :)",,False,self,t5_2qu5n,False,,,True,t3_y7kfo,http://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/y7kfo/husband_realized_we_arent_sexually_compatible/,

At first I actually thought it was a trap, that she wanted me to tell her so she could use it against me. But she never did, and in fact she really got aroused hearing about the things I wanted to do to women I saw in porn (which we watched together). But I figured that was it, just a little fantasy and nothing more.

On New Year's Eve this year, we were by ourselves and a mutual female friend was alone and out of town. So she and I started texting, and for fun started some sexual banter. It began as trying to one-up each other with clever sexual innuendo, but after midnight it started to get serious with pictures being sent and eventually we sent full nudes. My wife was more than just okay, she was actually really getting in to it!

The next week, second woman and I sent pictures and had some pretty raunchy talk, which my wife totally got off on when I relayed it to her. By the time second woman was back in town, we were ready to make things happen. We all went out to dinner and watched a movie, then back at her place, she and I headed to her bedroom while my wife hung back.

So, it was amazing! I hadn't ever really dated much in college and had only been with my wife for six years, so the thrill of being with another woman in the bedroom was fantastic! We didn't have sex, but we did do just about everything else. We both went twice and had huge smiles on our faces when we came back to the living room where my wife was.

And can you believe it? She was so happy for us! We talked about how we felt now that something had happened in real life, and we were all fine with it. In fact, once the wife and I got home we had amazing sex and then once again in the morning.

So now we've got this thing with another girl, her friend, and its basically a dream come true. My wife is amazing, and I love her more than anything...this only makes me love her more. Its really sparked our sex life into a whole new chapter. And we both totally trust her friend because they were friends first; she's not going to try to get between us.

My life is fucking awesome.

Been with my wife for almost 10 years, just celebrated our 5th wedding anniversary this year. She's been with her BF for over a year. He is now living with us. It's perfect. He lives in our guest room, we still commandeer the master bedroom. He's the best roommate either of us have had. We all three run the household wonderfully. He and I get along like the dickens, something I never expected. 

I have been trying to find a perfect 2nd for me, but that involves some ""research,"" as it were. He said happily.

I currently have I have 3 girlfriends, 2 of them long distance. 

- Girl 1 lives overseas, and is bi (as is my wife - we have a triangle). She can only visit once per year, but we love her to death.
- Girl 2 lives in the same state, but in another city. She and I have a very long history together, predating my marriage. We've known each other since our early 20s. We see each other every 2-4 weeks.
- Girl 3 lives locally, is poly and married, and has been involved with me and my wife in another triangle for almost ten years. She and I are very much in love, and have a connection with each other and my wife that intimidates other people.
- I also have two very sporadic Friends With Benefits.

This means time is at a premium. [This has been my month so far.](http://i.imgur.com/VtXiH.jpg)

It should be noted that my wife and I are in our later 30s, and we are only fluid bonded (as it's called) to one another. We practice safe sex with everyone else. We also get tested every 6 months, because we're all up in the responsibleness like that. I've had a vasectomy, she's on BC pills.

We need to buy stock in condom conpanies, is my guess.

He would only have eyes for her, and he'd put her on the highest pedestal in the land.

Fast forward 15 years, and I'm sitting in a car with my mother trying to explain how my boyfriend can sleep with other people and still love me just as much as any Prince Charming. She insists that if he really loved me, he wouldn't be interested in anyone else. She insists that I'm trying to logically convince myself that poly is *right* and not listening to what's really in my heart. She insists that I'm settling and being a coward, that I'm just with him to not be alone, and that if I really wanted to be happy, he'd have to change or I'd have to leave. My real Prince Charming, who would selflessly sacrifice himself on my slightest whim of want was just around the corner.

Coming from the mono side of my mono-poly relationship, some of the things she said did ring a bell. I want to feel special. I want to be with someone I can trust completely, who loves me and is committed to me, who will be there for me when I need him, even if he's seeing other people. I'm not interested in sleeping with another person at this time, but I do want to build relationships. I like the idea of having an intimate circle of friends, a second family, stemming from his other relationships. I like the idea of not being selfish or jealous in love. I like the idea of standing up for myself when my needs are not being met, and being able to discuss those needs with someone who is committed to me. I like the idea of relying on myself to be happy, not a Prince Charming. Am I settling for being a side-thought? No, I'm not. Am I settling for a relationship that's anything less than what I should want? No, I'm not.

I know my mother will probably never understand. She compares my relationship to the one she has with my father: A marriage to someone who always left her out, who doesn't make her feel special, and a commitment that she's quit caring about. I understand that she's worried about me, but I also know that I'm not her and my boyfriend is not my father. 

I called my boyfriend after the conversation, and we talked through minor issues that I'd been having, but was hesitant to bring up, similar problems that my mother has faced with my father. He understood and we worked through them, a testament to open and honest communication in **any** sort of relationship.

Perhaps I am being too logical about this. Love is a matter of the heart, after all. But if I wasn't crazy in love with him in the first place, I don't think I could even try to talk myself through why I'm doing this, talk myself out of jealousy, or talk myself through a deep criticism of why monogamy is the acceptable norm.

Last night my wife and I went on our first date as a poly couple.  She had never been with another woman and wanted us to ""go for it"" together.  We met up with a woman that we had spoken with a bit online at a cozy little artsy bar called Picasso's.  The wife and I were SO nervous.  I'm sure our date was too, since she had never done this before either.  It was so funny, because, for the first hour, my wife was so shy and oblivious, that she couldn't tell that our new friend (who was sitting next to her) was putting her hand under the table to hold her hand.  I had to give her ""pro tips"" on how to interpret incoming signals of interest while our date was in the bathroom.  After she got back, my wife caught on, much to our date's delight, they got closer and closer, leaned into eachother and everything just clicked.  We had drinks, laughed, ate some delicious food, laughed some more, listened to horrible live music, moved to the big soft couches, held hands and discretely touched and explored each other, laughed, played connect four, watched muted spanish soap operas, laughed and then got up to leave.  We walked our date to her car and, due to the nature of the evening and the remarkable amount of amazing energy that was in the air, my wife and our amazing date kissed each other...  Intensely...  For a while...  I watched and came to the conclusion that that was the greatest night of my life.      


EDIT!!!:  Second date last night.

So after the decidedly successful first date, we decided it'd be best to leave it at kisses for now, take a day to sort our feelings and then plan on meeting to watch a mardi gras parade together the next evening.  We did so and, after the previous night's happenings, the wife and our friend were noticeably distracted from normal conversation and kept glancing and smiling at each other.  They didn't kiss again upon meeting, which was cute, because I could tell they were both thinking about it and just couldn't work up the nerve.  So, we watched the parade, laughed and cheered, got beads (""[bees?](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emgXwYWqd9Y)""), and then, retired to a nearby pub.  They sat next to each other and finally held hands and we ate, talked and joked about things.  After a while, we tried to decide what to do next.  No one would make a solid decision because we all just wanted to go back to our friends house and ""expand upon"" last night's happenings.  So we did.  Unless requested, I won't go into explicit detail only because we pretty much got naked and pleasured each other for 5 or 6 hours straight.  My wife kissed, performed oral sex and came with her first woman ever.  So did our friend.  I...  Well...  I'll stop there.  TMI, maybe...

EDIT PART 2:  The Detailing.  Caution!  This is really explicit.  It's kind of embarrassing how detailed it is but read at your own peril.  Also, sorry about the wall-o-text.  I don't know how to make paragraphs.

Ok, so date 2, at our friends house.  I send them on ahead in her car.  Later my wife told me this was a good plan since she wanted to let our friend know that she had no reservations or ""limits"" as far as activities that I could participate in.  Our friend apparently enthusiastically agreed.  I arrived 10 minutes behind them.  My wife was in the restroom and I was immediately attacked at the door.  I was delighted to find that our friend was a FANTASTIC kisser (as is my wife) and we got into it pretty heavily before my wife came out of the restroom.  She immediately came over and stole my new friend away with some mighty skilled lip action and they moved off to the bedroom.  I watched as they finally got to start doing what we had all three dreamed about the previous night.  Kissing, squeezing, licking, sighing, me smiling as I watched them go at it.  You might wonder why I didn't just jump in.  Well, this was my wife and our new friends first time with their same sex.  I wanted their memories of that contact to be pure and without my bumbling self involved.  I planned on letting them completely explore each other before I even got undressed.  That plan, like many things formed with good intentions, did NOT last long.  At some point, my wife turned over and said something to the effect of ""why isn't that cock out yet, sir?"".  Our friend loudly agreed with her sentiment and I did not try to resist.  Friend and I worked on my wife, sucking her nipples in tandem while I showed our friend where wife liked to be touched, stroked and teased.  She made her cum within a couple of minutes.  Wife and I repeated the previous steps on Friend  (She had the MOST AMAZING NIPPLES I HAVE EVER SEEN!) and I got to show Wife how to eat pussy for the first time. :)  SO cool!
Then, they decided it was time to team up on me.  Two extremely horny women working on my dick.  Not to be showy like a cheesy porn or something.  These two women clearly enjoyed oral sex.  Friend sat on my face and 69'd while Wife took turns sucking and licking.  She later said it was better than flying solo since, when she got tired, she could ""tag out"" to Friend.  When I announced that they were going to make me cum (normally when Wife leans away due to a aversion to jizz...  I know... so sad), Wife said ""do it"" and Friend sucked down the entire load.  They had discussed this secretly and were delighted to learn that Friend was obsessed with eating cum.  Sneaky bitches :D!  My mind exploded. 
After an hour or so, Wife had already came twice but Friend wanted another go.  She went down and started eating.  She stopped only to lean over and order me to fuck her.  I did as told and went in doggy style, fucking her quite energetically.  She felt amazing (the first woman besides my wife that I've fucked in 8 years) and the motion of me pounding her, carried over to her mouth and fingers.  Wife screamed so loud, it scared Friend's cats.
We spent the rest or the night playing, cuddling, feeling and generally fondling the living shit out of each other. 
Friend had to work early the next morning so we eventually kissed her goodnight together, almost getting into it again, and left her to sleep.

Some of our dates never happen because we would meet up and then just talk the hours away unil we realized how late is suddenly was. She was already in a relationship but it ended by the end of 2012. We continued to see each other but less and less as 2013 got underway. As of last week she found herself in a situation were she met a new guy and really wanted try a fully committed relationship with him. So on our last date she told me all about him and how we should remain friends and but couldn't date anymore. Not forever but only until she felt she had a reliable committed partner. As always we had more great conversation and left each other for the evening. She was my first relationship in my open arrangement and for the first time it was nice to end our dating in such positive fashion.

1369641183.0,39,self.polyamory,1f4lud,"R/Poly, how should my husband, his girlfriend, and I deal with the gossip who has accused them of cheating on me?",47,8,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1f4lud/rpoly_how_should_my_husband_his_girlfriend_and_i/,"A vengeful ex-roommate of ours (A*) has decided that my husband (P) and his girlfriend (R)'s relationship should be public knowledge now, and that I am being cheated on despite the fact that I too have a girlfriend (J) and have been very happy with our polyamory.  A's gossip has put R in a nasty position with a number of their ('til now) mutual friends, and could potentially cause a great many problems between my husband's employer and both of our families if it gets that far.

R and P are breaking up for now, at least partially because of potential legal ramifications (side warning--in California you can be dinged for adultery even if all parties involved consent to the relationship and are of legal age, and our state is far more conservative than California).  We all know it's probably best for R legally and socially at this point, but I'm a little worried about how to keep our friendship strong with this strain on it, especially since R is the person who is seeing the worst effects of A's actions.  If anyone has advice on this I'd love to hear it.

We also need to figure out the best way to put the kibosh on A's gossip.  We're going to try asking both her and her fiance nicely (though I honestly don't think she'll listen to his opinion on this, since she's convinced she's right and won't listen to anything else he says that benefits people other than herself), but after that, what are our options?

Legally, I'm sure we could try a restraining order, or we could file harassment/slander lawsuits, but I don't know that anyone there will take our side, especially if we are honest about the polyamory.

Socially, we can start off by letting people know she's holding a grudge and to please ignore her gossip.  So far, I've kept that to one family member who runs in the same circles, since that family member is the biggest link to our families and the social group A and R (and P and I to a lesser degree) run in, but I'll probably be using that line a lot in the coming weeks.  I would guess that my spearheading that effort will probably help to dampen her effectiveness (both since I am supposedly the ""wronged"" person and since I'm generally known for being the sweet quiet girl who is only assertive when someone's done something truly horrible).  On the other hand, might acknowledging the rumors make people more curious?  Might they feed into her destruction instead of working as damage control?

There's a part of me that really wants to start working at getting A banned from events she loves and rejected by her friend-group, but I don't know that I want to go down that road.  A is doing a good job of both of those on her own, between using people, gossiping, and generally being a bitch, but it's so tempting to speed the process in any way possible, and simply telling people why we kicked her out would likely be enough to destroy her in a lot of social circles.   For that matter, a little of me wonders if I shouldn't be warning people just so they don't end up physically, emotionally, socially, or monetarily messed up like she's done to us and other people she's bragged to us about.  Hell, perhaps I should be offering her fiance support so he knows he won't be hated for leaving her.  It helped me to leave an abusive relationship when my then-boyfriend's best friend asked me why I was with the guy who treated me like that.

I guess, in the end, the question is how to salvage the situation especially as it applies R and A's mutual friend group, and how to help R and P to deal with this as well as possible.

I'm talking with a psychologist about other things and will address this, but while my shrink is generally great and non-judgmental about the polyamory, she is still looking at this from a clinical point of view rather than a personal one.  I suppose I could use your advice and support, especially in dealing with the poly-specific parts of this issue.

I've continued my relationship with them but neither my mom nor I have brought it up again. 

fast forward to being home for Christmas, my mom was talking about my brother who got married and had a baby girl, all within the past year and a half. obviously, my family expects me to be next. I'll be 25 next month and I've always told my mom i thought 25 was the earliest I would ever get married. that and I've always fantasized about being married for a good while before having kids. and having kids is something I really want to do.

so today I was having a conversation with my mom and I said something about wanting to be married before I'm in my 30's so that I don't have to have kids right away like my brother and his wife did. she quickly responded with, ""well you're not going to marry a couple so you can forget about that."" she then continued to go on a rant about how disgusting she thought homosexuality/bisexuality/polyamory was. needless to say i exited the convo as soon as i could.

and what sucks is that although my mom and I typically have a very good relationship and she considers herself to be pretty progressive (we've even smoked pot together), she doesn't care if I'm happy in the kind of relationship I'm in right now. it hurts. a lot. because i *am* happy with my relationship. something I've never experienced before.

But I'm a complete polyamory noob and this has been my primary concern with going poly. I need either a wake-up call or reassurance. Please and thank you!

Although I'm young and rather attractive, I feel like my charms lie primarily out of the realm of sexuality. I've been told that my personality is appealing and I have a pretty face and am not overweight, but my body just isn't very attractive. I've always had very small breasts (think A-'s) even though I'm not thin, and I look my best with clothes on. I also know that I'm no star in the bedroom. I honestly love sex, and when I can I have it every day, but apparently I'm just not that great. Even when I'm having a good time and feel like I'm really giving it my all, the feedback I've received is that I never seem like I'm all that into it, that I easily get complacent, and that I'm simply uninspired. 

So my fear is that, if I consistently let my partner be with other people, he won't want to have sex with me at all. I'm somewhat bisexual and I definitely understand the appeal of larger breasts, so I can't imagine that he could mess around with a pair of C's and then come home to me without being disappointed. And when he recently, for the first time in our two-year relationship, had sex with someone other than me and I badgered him into telling me how it was (I know...bad move), he pretty much told me that she was straight-up better than me. So if he has the daily choice between having sex with me and someone better, why would he ever choose me? And if he does regularly have sex with people better at sex and/or more attractive than me, will he even enjoy having sex with me when we do?

Please help me out, poly men of reddit! Tell me how you think and what kinds of decisions you have or would make in a situation like this. I know my boyfriend loves me, but I don't want polyamory to ruin our sex life or further cripple my self-esteem. Thanks!

It's very apparent how they feel about open relationships, and it's very apparent these Redditors don't have a ""Live and Let Live"" mentality. 

I suppose the biggest reason these comments rub me the wrong way is because they're reminders that I used to be that way. I used to disrespectfully reject people who had open relationships in an attempt to deny something about myself I wasn't ready to admit. I'm not saying these people are secretly Poly or anything, but something more along the lines of ""I know what it's like to feel that way and I wish you'd stop being so damn judgmental!

Not everyone has to like non-monogamy for themselves, but it'd be nice if people wouldn't speak about it so rudely and with such negative judgment.

So my wife came out to her MOH, and the news is great!  After both going through several mini wines and a little weed she was able to tell her how she felt.  Her MOH got really excited and told her that she has felt the same way.  The MOH also told her that she was trying to hint at it at Christmas (which was just the 3 of us this year) over eating grapefruit, which we had joked about being a pussy.  Anyway, through the conversation the MOH said that she is definitely straight, but has been wanting to try messing around with another girl. Which, by the way she stated it, sounded more like she was protecting herself from embarrassment than what she actually believed.  But, i guess that's just speculation.  (I wasn't in the room, but I could hear a good portion of the conversation through our thin walls.  I wasn't trying to creep, but it's not the kind of conversation you can just distract yourself by reading.  Honestly, I tried and failed.)  The MOH stayed over, but nothing happened.  It was already around 3-3:30am when they decided to go to bed, and both the MOH and I had work early in the morning.  My wife didn't have to be at work until 2 that afternoon.    Apparently the MOH intentionally left her laptop at our place so she could come back over after she got off and have lunch with my wife.  They shyly/nervously started talking more about this newly revealed mutual attraction and what it meant.  When I was brought up in the conversation, the MOH seemed to be very careful as to not assume I would be involved, which I believe she was just being respectful of my wife.  I was intentionally left out of the list of people the MOH said she wanted to make out with at our parties, which get pretty playfully sexual most of the time.   When my wife asked, ""Why not [husband/me]?"" the MOH said ""I don't know, I just figured you wouldn't want me to"" to which my wife replied, ""I thought you said you were going to have sex with [husband/me] after we got married"".  To which the MOH happily added me back into her list.
---------------------
Aside:
My wife didn't know exactly how she felt about me being involved until after she found out there was a definite mutual attraction.  Since then, she has been fantasizing quite a bit about me and the MOH together.  My wife decided that if I was going to be in the picture in the future, she was going to have to make it clear at that point, that I wasn't off the table.
--------------------

My wife had to go to work at 2 and since the MOH didn't make it over until around 1, they only had brief amount of time together.  But the MOH is planning on coming over tonight and tomorrow night, which I see as the beginning of something beautiful.  It has been really awesome to hear my wife talk about her excitement about it.  She has been really surprised by how she now feels after talking to the MOH.  She said she is experiencing the excitement of doing something new for the first time, like when she was younger.  It's the same feeling of excitement as her first kiss and her first sexual experience with a guy.  I am really happy for her.  It's incredible to see and experience my wife go through these emotions for another woman, not to mention a huge turn on.

Anyway, that's all the info I've got right now, but I felt ya'll deserved an update.  I really appreciated everyone's input. I let my wife read everything and I think it helped her make her decision to say something.  Ya'll have an awesome community here and I'm very glad I found it.  Thanks!

Also, I'm not quite sure why most of my post is in blue. I must have screwed it up when placing the link to my previous post.

First of all, thank you to this subreddit.  I've learned so much from here.  It's good that there is such an open community about this.  Without this I would have not been as easily able to develop how I've felt about relationships for a long while.

Anyway, on to the situation.  

My wife and I just recently were married in October and she is now realizing that she has developed a crush on her MOH.  She realized this after getting upset when her MOH told her about having made out with another girl the previous night.  (My wife has always been bi-curious and finds herself very attracted to woman, and we've had a small recurring fantasy involving the MOH, but we've never actually made any advance or tried to make it a reality.)   My wife kinda felt rejected, because her and the MOH have had a playful ""lesbian"" relationship where they often joke about doing things together and they get very ""friendly"" at parties.  It has gotten to the point where my wife really doesn't know if she is still just joking around or if there is actually something there.  On one had she acts as though she's very interested, but on the other says she's only into ""Penis"".

Now, what makes matters complicated, the MOH has become almost like family.  She is over at our apartment several days during the week and she considers us her closest friends.  We are the closest thing to family she has in the area and we don't want to ruin such a good relationship.  My wife is getting restless because she doesn't like feeling like she's in limbo.  It's not as much she absolutely wants something to happen, but she just wants to know so she can either move on to finding another girl or if her MoH actually has feelings for her seeing where that leads.

Another level of complexity.  Personally, I am trying to be objective about this and since this is the first time my wife is having feelings for another woman, I want her to figure out on her own, exactly how she feels. But as a guy who is extremely turned on by the thought of my wife being with another woman, it's difficult to do.  I am also attracted to the MoH, which is mutual.  Leading up to the wedding the MoH would joke that she was going to have sex with me only after I was married.

So long and thanks for all the fish!

I've identified as poly since I was 19, dating a really incredible guy 11 years older. He wasn't so much identified as poly as ""We're adults and as long as we're honest and communicate, let's live our lives and be happy."" While in that 4 year relationship there were a lot of firsts, a lot of healing from past emotional/sexual trauma and a lot of learning. That guy is, to this day, one of my closest, most trusted friends. 

That was almost 10 years ago. I've been the unicorn. I've been engaged (though we broke up for reasons unrelated to poly.) I've dated up to 3 people at a time, both guys and ladies, from 3 weeks to almost 5 years. I'm certainly not perfect, but every time a relationship ended, I tried really hard to take a good look at what worked well, what didn't, and what future relationships might look like. Feels good to be honest and real with yourself and other people. 

Almost a year ago I moved cross-country from the Western US to the Northeast, to a city I had never set foot in. I was coming from Portland, OR, which has a thriving, very interconnected poly community. I found a community in my new home that seemed open to my usual style of relationship. Then something interesting happened: I met M. 

M is the most compatible partner I've ever had in my life. It's been almost 9 months together and I never ever get tired of his face, his silly jokes, the way his hair falls into his eyes. I told him at the beginning that poly is my generally preferred relationship style and though he had never engaged in that before, he was interested. But, much to my surprise, I don't feel the urge to seek out other relationships. I occasionally fantasize about having a girlfriend again (something M very much supports) but it's always short-lived. (Though I do have a very close female friend who is occasionally a lover and who adores M as well, so there's that.) M will tell me he's crushing on this or that person, and I totally encourage him to seek out opportunities to get to know them, but nothing's ever come of that. He once said to me, ""Do you think we'll ever be functionally poly?"" 

I thought about it and replied, ""I don't know. I've never been so happy as I am with you right now. Do you feel stifled?"" 

He said, ""No, this is the best relationship I've ever had.""

So, /r/polyamory, that brings us to today. I'm reading the posts here by all you fine people and thinking ""I'm not really poly right now. And I am just not wired for jealousy, so at least 50% of these posts I can offer no help on."" The one time a partner did anything that resembled cheating turned out to be a miscommunication on boundaries. I've never had issues coming out to friends/family. I've never dated anyone with kids… The list of issues in the subreddit that people need advice on doesn't seem to cross over much with the things I need or can help out on. So, I'm just going to unsubscribe.

I'm not totally certain why I felt the need to post that I'm doing it. I guess just because I feel like this is really a community, and even though I didn't contribute that much, it seemed rude to just disappear. Also, just to let people know that relationship styles *do* change over time, as we learn and grow and that's okay. There was a post awhile back where someone felt weird about calling themselves poly when they were in an essentially monogamous relationship. I said to just be honest with yourself and your partner(s) and not focus on labels.

I've been lurking r/polyamory for a while, so I figured I'd say hi. Maybe this will be a wall of text, maybe not. Let's see.

I have only ever been in monogamous, het relationship, but have always considered myself possibly bi. When I met my husband, I knew I wanted to spend the rest of my life building a family with him. When we married, I gave up the idea of a relationship with a woman because I am so 100% sure of my love for my man, and didn't know anything else was possible. I didn't see it as a loss, because I was gaining my husband, just as something that would have been interesting, but I'd never know. No big deal.  Last summer we started hanging out with a co-worker of his due to kid play-dates, and she fit with us really well. We got up the courage to ask her into the bedroom with us, and I laid down the ""no emotions"" rule between the three of us. However, I quickly realized that rule wasn't going to work, as I began to be interested in her, and the attraction between her and my husband was obvious. We started looking into this subreddit, and realized that polyamory was an option for us. r/polyamory gave us a foundation and tools to pursue a triad (thanks guys!). I was very nervous at first, as I had never known something like this existed, and it was my husband that introduced her. I wasn't sure how I would react to my husband dating another woman. However, my relationship with him has never been better, and she seems to be very in sync with the both of us. 
Now, we're a few months into this, and I am loving it. I am downright giddy! Every time we/I see her and hang out, everything feels right. I'm amazed at how easy this transition has been, and how well the three of us run the house together. 
And, i'm stumped at how little jealousy I've experienced. Granted, I know it won't be this easy all of the time, but the issues that have come up have been either thought or talked through with relative ease. Is this normal?! I'm truly shocked at how easy it's been to share my husband with her, and myself. When I see them kiss or cuddle, I feel warmth and happiness, not cold jealousy. Who knew?? 
While my relationship with her is progressing at a slower rate than her and my husband, we can talk about anything together, and understand each other really well. She helps me feel better when I am stressed, and I relax just being around her. And it feels wonderful to explore a relationship with a woman, something I had thought I'd never get a chance to do! I find myself daydreaming about the three of us raising our family together, and expanding it. Every time I get all fuzzy inside. :-) 
Like anyone in a wonderful relationship, I want to just talk talk talk about it all day long! But, as we are new to this, and not ""out"" yet, I have very few people I can actually talk to.

Lately, I've found myself being frustrated with a certain aspect of my poly relationship, I am a secondary partner to my bf.
I've met his primary partner and the three of us actually get together on a rather frequent basis as well as her and I even hanging out one on one from time to time.

We get along swimmingly, but recently, I've discovered that my partner has been sharing every intimate detail of our relationship with her, and I don't mean just sex, everything I say and do is reported back to her. 

The thing is, I understand she is his primary, and I understand the necessity to have honest communication in any poly relationship....
But I am not in a relationship with her, we have never been intimate nor do either of us intend to. 
And it makes me incredibly uncomfortable that he has given himself the right to discuss my private life with his other partner.

I've tried talking to him about it and he remains adamant about the fact that he wants to be 100% honest with her about everything. 

Am I crazy for wanting my boundaries? 
Should my requests be ignored because I am a secondary partner?

Any help?



EDIT: I realize I may have expressed myself a little vaguely about the information he is divulging, I am completely fine with him discussing the aspects of our relationship with her, (he told me from the beginning that this was going to happen) as I understand that I have come in to an existing relationship and that communication is important. What I meant by ""intimate details"" was more along the lines of what we talk about outside of our relationship.
He is revealing private things to her about, say, my family or previous sexual experiences and while she is a good friend, there are things I simply don't care to reveal to too many people.
And as these things have no impact on our relationship, I really don't feel it is his right to talk about them. ",,False,self,t5_2qu5n,1339187406.0,,,True,t3_urzwx,http://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/urzwx/having_some_privacy_issues_in_poly_relationship/,

After about twelve AM, Ryan and I go pick up my daughter since my husband was 'occupied'. :3 She falls asleep in her room and we go back to playing games.

He greets me with this huge grin in the hallway, says 'that was kind of hot', kisses me, and pushes me back into Ryan's bedroom.

Eventually we met her. It was fun. And the second time it was fun and the third etc etc. every time, my wife was the aggressor.   

So we're falling in to a situation. It feels great. It feels natural and honest and warm and productive. I really care for the girlfriend. 

But the thing is this. I never consciously wanted anything but my wife and she only wanted a threesome or two. If I ever wanted more sex, i wanted it from her. If I wanted more affection or attention, I wanted it from her. She's affectionate and we have sex a dozen times a week or so, so its no lack of them that made this happen. 

But honestly, i like having somebody else around. I learned this stuff, it didn't come to me naturally.  If the girlfriend flakes (not a remote possibility) Id like another.  

So if its not for the sex and its not instinctive, am I poly?  My wife is bisexual, but is she poly?  She feels the same as me. The girlfriend cant get over how natural and comfortable our situation feels. Not one of us imagined, planned, or desired this situation before it happened.

I consider myself to be a pretty desirable guy, but it seems like the usual balance of sexual power (the women are wanted and guys are supposed to knock each other over trying to get them) is amplified considerably in the context of polyamory.

First, it seems like it's really frowned upon to be looking mostly for a triad, ESPECIALLY an ffm triad, but hear me out. 

My wife is incredibly sexy and wouldn't have any problem getting guys or girls on her own, but I'm concerned that people are less interested in her because she's the stereotypical ""I want to date a girl and maybe have my husband join in later"" scenario that I see people complaining about on here and in lgbt so often. I understand that you can't force other people into a mold, and her okcupid profile is up front about what she wants and that she's open to letting things become whatever they become. 

So from my perspective, as the straight husband of a bi woman, it seems like I'm the scapegoat for the community's ire because I'm the ""creepy guy who wants an ffm triad."" That kind of sucks. I can't do anything about not being bi, and honestly I know that would make life a lot easier because single guys seem to be a dime a dozen no matter what community you're in. I don't want to be the asshole but I'm afraid if we try a truly separate approach - with each of us looking for people individually and doing most of the poly stuff apart - it'll end up with her having what she wants and me getting left out in the cold. What's more, even if we did both get separate girlfriends I don't really have an interest in pursuing romance that doesn't involve my wife in any way.

So I guess what I'm saying is that going poly just makes me feel kind of hopeless about being a straight guy. Is it so bad to want an inclusive relationship? I'm not asking for someone to like both of us exactly the same, or even necessarily to be sexual with both of us. I would just like the idea of being together more than the idea of my wife just being a roommate I come home to when we're done with other people. 

Also, since somebody will probably suggest these: Yes, I think I'd be fine with a quad under the right circumstances. Yes, we've tried swinging. That's fun, sure, but that community seems to be really into the physical, hedonistic aspects of sex and we both like the idea of something more meaningful, someone we could take out to dinner, go hiking with, play board games with, really interact with and appreciate, and not just fuck. 

I'm not sure if there's a question in there other than this: Is there any hope for me? Does anybody think my approach is valid, or am I just another greedy bastard that wants two pieces of arm candy? I know what I want, and it feels dishonest to compromise on that so readily just because the poly community wants everyone to date as singles.

I wanted to ask where one gets the energy and drive to *want* to maintain multiple intimate relationships and then to actually do it, but in the course of reading *The Ethical Slut*, my question changed form radically, then disappeared. It’s gone.

I read *The Ethical Slut* and have been furiously processing since. I wanted to find out what makes polyamory attractive and to understand some of the core concepts. I was also sincerely curious about how this stuff works for people.

The book is written as a guide for people who already know polyamory interests them, so it quite wisely isn’t a sales piece. It makes imminent sense from cover to cover. The authors make a convincing case that non-monogamy can work, and they provide good examples of arrangements that work at least as well as traditional monogamy can sometimes work. There was nothing I substantially disagreed with. It was fascinating to have my preconceptions turned upside-down.

A lot of *The Ethical Slut* -- the parts about communication, fighting fair, and so forth -- would be excellent material for *anyone*, not just those interested in the book’s main topic.

I felt great admiration for the authors and for everyone willing to challenge the larger culture’s mores but I felt deeply sad many times while reading. Certainly many of the personal anecdotes in the book are sad, or at least bittersweet but it particularly saddened me to realize how my family background, the place I grew up, and the mores of the period I was born conspired to make me someone whose relationship options have always been narrow due to baggage like my emotional issues, my introversion, and my poor social skills.

Before you say, “Yes but you can *learn* social skills! You can *learn* to be less introverted. Get some therapy and *deal with your emotional issues!*”, bear in mind that I finally realized over a decade ago that I needed serious help with those things and have been working on them as fast as I can, but you don’t root out some kinds of damage quickly. I’m emotionally healthier now than I’ve ever been. I’m happy most of the time, my relationship is in better shape than ever, and in the past several years I’ve finally learned how to behave well enough at work to hold down a job. These may seem trivial to you, but they were very difficult for me. A solid set of accomplishments given where I was 12 years ago.

Like Charlotte Joko Beck says, “You start where you are.” And so I did.

It was also odd to realize that I feel sex-positive about *everyone else’s* desires and habits but when it comes to my own sexuality, I still have a lot of work to do even in the admittedly limited context of my strictly monogamous relationship. I’m in late middle age now but I think I lag behind most 20-somethings in terms of my emotional and sexual understanding.

And really what it comes down to for me is, it would be astoundingly unfair for me to impose my general fuck-up-edness on additional intimate partners. Also, I feel confident that my discomfort with people in general, my poor social skills, and my introversion would make me poor company and understandably unwelcome at various kinds of play parties. Hell, I make most people uncomfortable just trying to talk about the weather; I can’t imagine how awkward I’d be at a swing or a BDSM play party, for example, where social cues are apparently vitally important. So it’s better for everyone if I keep tending to my garden, making my little increments of progress, and don’t try to play with the big kids.

I think I wanted to post this mostly to say that I admire your courage and I envy how well-adjusted most who post here seem to be. I also thought it might be helpful to see the perspective of an oddball outcast for whom polyamory would be unwise. It’s just not an option.

Seriously: kudos, and thank you. I continue to follow your adventures with great interest.

Now we knew that we would be seen/treated differently by people - but we're not very typical, we're quite open in our relationship (monogomish) and beyond that just very trusting and easy going socially - so we assumed that people would eventually come around to understanding that we weren't a 2 and a half kids/ picket-fency kind of couple (not that there's anything wrong with that).    
    
Wrong.    
Surprisingly wrong!    
    
I mean, after knowing us for a while, people accept us as an unusual married couple - but we kind of lost all of our individuality. We're no longer omniumamore and omniumamore's husband, now we're a unit (we wanted to be a unit but not exclusively a unit). This is okay most of the time but very frustrating other times, especially for me, being the wife.    
    
I notice that I get, what I like to call ""wifed"", a lot. Being wifed is when someone takes a completely normal action and attributes it to a wife status, treats you differently because of being a wife, or tries to put you ""back in your place"" of being a wife if they personally feel like you've overstepped your wife abilities. This also includes making assumptions about you because you are a wife rather than just asking you one way or the other like they would for any other person.    
    
I will give some examples:    
1. Guys won't talk to me anymore, or not nearly as much. Makes some sense I guess, but at this point they know me and my husband well enough to know that we would rather be treated as individuals and that we are also comfortable with each other talking to members of the opposite sex -- not to mention that I'm not going to jump every guy that has a normal conversation with me. Of course guys talk to me - but its like ""how's the weather"" ""work sucks"" ""ok that's nice I'm gonna go over here now....""    
Added on to this is a weird double standard that girls have no problem talking to my husband though -- it's like I had nothing to offer the world but my sex, however, my husband still has more to give.    
2. If I'm anywhere near friends and I fuss at my husband for any reason, legitimate or not - someone inevitably goes ""oh, you just got wifed!"" or something of that like. (this does not mean chewing him out in public)    
3. The worst of these to me is being told by people not my husband when I'm acting inappropriately as a wife. Recently, we went out dancing together with friends, I was dressed up sexily, every girl was -- at some point though while dancing a male friend approached me and told me that it wasn't fair for me to be so sexy while being married. Worse than that when said guy was sober later he apologized for being flirty...to my husband.    
    
Long story short - I am no longer treated like an individual - some people have told me that that's just how this is, which frustrates me a lot. What do you ladies and gentlemen think of all of this? I want to be married to my husband, I love him, but I want to be able to be as free and open and individual as we are both happy with and why is that anyone else's business? Sigh.    
    
TL;DR : Got married, happy about it, but now I'm treated like a wife first and a woman second or not at all (in small and sometimes large ways). I personally think this is fucked up - anyone with similar experiences or thoughts??

I was married 25 years. It was a disastrous relationship that scarred everyone involved. (She had Borderline Personality Disorder and I had a nasty case of co-dependency.) We split up 8 years ago.

Not long after, I met Gabby. She changed my life. Beautiful, sexual, open, honest. The polar opposite of my ex-wife. I fell hard and I fell fast. Six months into the relationship, I realized I wanted to spend the rest of my life with this woman. She is the best friend I ever had.

We were both very sex-crazy in those early days. We talked a lot about what we wanted, and I admitted to her that I would love to have sexual relationships with more women than just her. At the time, she was open to that. We even tried out a little swinging, but she always pulled back before it ever turned into anything more than heavy petting.

Time passes. Things change. She says she is 100% monogamous, and isn't interested in sex with anyone else. I, on the other hand, have not changed. I am definitely interested in being sexually involved with women in addition to Gabby. She's back and forth about that. One day she is okay with it, the next day not ok at all.

Here's the thing: she is my one-in-a-billion. I love her more than I ever imagined I would ever love anyone, and I cannot imagine life without her. But my libido/sex drive/general horn-dogginess isn't cooperating with my heart.

I absolutely positively will not cheat on her. 100% honesty is my mantra. But most of the time I am also crazy with - I dunno - animal lust? I have reached a point in my life where I have tremendous confidence around all women and am pretty certain I could seduce any woman I focused on. (Gabby agrees with this, by the way.) But I also am aware that there is this HUGE unknown lurking on the other side. What if I *do* become sexually non-monogamous and Gabby cannot handle it? 

I cannot imagine life without her, and as a result, I keep my sex drive largely under control.  But Gabby pushes me about ""not being true to myself"". She asks, ""what if you really are polyamorous? What if you are denying who you really are?"" It is very important to us that we allow each other to Be Who We Are and not put constraints on each another. Basically, the only constraint we have is ""Be Honest"". But I fear that acting on this non-mongamous impulse will cost me Gabby.

This may sound dumb but it is a genuine struggle. On the one hand, Gabby is my soulmate. On the other hand, I have no desire to be monogamous. (Or perhaps it would be better to say I have a very strong desire not to be monogamous.) I think maybe swinging is what I want - recreational sex - but I also know that I am a fundamentally kind person who will likely create emotional connections with most women I am sexually involved with.

Am I truly poly or am I just a man-whore? 

I go back and forth. I know I love Gabby more than anything in the world, but I also know that I am sexually attracted to - and attractive to - many women. I know that most of the regrets I have in life are regrets for what I did NOT do, rather than for anything I have done.

My fear is that if I act on my innate non-monogamy, I will lose Gabby, and if I don't, I will lose me.

We only hook up with people rarely, when the other is out of town or something like that. We agreed that we don't want to hear about it if the other hooks up with someone, but they were free to if the opportunity arose.
I forgot my phone at home one day and he dropped me off and gave me his phone so I could call him to pick me up. He told me that he picked up my phone to text me and saw a text from someone that he thought was sexual. (It said: can I have a preview?) He clicked on it and read it and didn't like what he saw. I haven't crossed any boundaries and I don't feel at all guilty about texting someone.


Part 2: I had a GW acct because it's fun and liberating. It's something I like doing. I had one previously and told him about it and he said he didn't like the idea of it but wouldn't stop me as long as he didn't know about it, asking me to delete that account. I did, but made a new one a few months later and didn't tell him, as he requested. Well, he looked through my computer too and found that new account. He didn't like that it had 1,000 upvotes, and told me that it made him feel uncomfortable knowing that so many people had seen my body.
I'm not ashamed about the texts or him finding my account. I'm somewhat upset because my privacy was violated and there are some feelings about trust mixed in but I don't know what they are, whether I feel like he doesn't trust me or if I feel that I shouldn't trust him, or what.
I'm confused and I want help sorting this out.

I'm fairly inexperienced in the area of looking for partners outside of my marriage and I figured that the OKC community would be a fairly straightforward way of locating women who share the same outlook on relationships and the wife and I. We're in our mid 20s in the SF area, which as far as I know is supposed to be really open to the whole concept. I doubt you'd be running around bars looking for potential poly-partners, but perhaps I'm totally wrong here. On OKC I make sure to emphasize the importance of open relationships and non-monogamy in my profile and set the expectations very clearly (no bait-n-switch!). So far not much has happened, I haven't been able to locate someone I've been interested in or the other way around. I'm wondering what kind of forces are at work here: is it just that we're very few? Is the usual ""online"" situation where even in the poly world, men vastly outnumber women?

1350004476.0,34,self.polyamory,11cbgq,Just some thoughts on being an independent person while being in a relationship.,41,7,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/11cbgq/just_some_thoughts_on_being_an_independent_person/,"There's this saying: Change it, leave it or love it. The following refers to ""change it"". 

For a little while now, I've been trying to reconcile not controlling my partner (e.g., not telling him what he can and cannot do, him not having to ask for permission) and letting him be who he is without him feeling like he's doing anything wrong and at the same time acknowledging my own emotional responses to his actions and respecting my own pace and boundaries in a way where I can continue to love him and be with him.

And this is what I've come up with.

I believe that people are independent entities that should be faithful to their own self, their needs, desires, their path to personal growth etc., and they don't have to put any other person, not even the people they love and care for, above themselves.

In a relationship, however, you and your partner form a team. For the relationship to be healthy, respectful, and loving, neither partner's needs and desires can have authority over the other, thereby dictating the status quo, and the boundaries of the relationship.

What has to preside over each individual's independent pursuit of happiness that takes place at the potential expense of the other's, is the team. Now this only makes sense when the team has mutual long term goals, or if both partners are open to exploring a partner's goal(s) as an option for their partnership when they aren't yet sure what they want or what their boundaries are.

(If there is no common basis and no openness to try, then one partner will always dictate the status quo- at the expense of the other partner's happiness. Or try to control and change their partner. That is not a healthy, loving relationship, and both partners should consider letting the other go find someone more compatible.)

Now, a team is always only as strong as it's weakest member. The weakest member by default dictates the pace of change, the boundaries etc. and the stronger member has to have patience: giving their partner the time to catch up (struggle, cope, heal), and go at their own pace, and give them the space for healthy growth, and change.

This does not mean disregarding or disrespecting where the stronger partner's at in the process and what they want. They still get to make independent choices for themselves. However, taking into consideration where your partner's at, what their fears and current boundaries are, what offends them and what helps them, is gonna help you make an informed decision that has the team's best interest at heart.

You can be a supportive partner by pointing out when they are avoiding change, or working against it (most likely out of fear), by reminding them of their goals, and by giving them the support they seek (reassurance, affection, space...).

This applies to any area of change really. It could be sex within the relationship (one partner wants to explore a kink), marriage or kids (one is ready, the other isn't), opening up the relationship...",,False,self,t5_2qu5n,False,,,True,t3_11cbgq,http://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/11cbgq/just_some_thoughts_on_being_an_independent_person/,

Tonight... I got it. I have fallen into what I can only describe as a polyamorous relationship with two women who I have come to love dearly. Tonight, they both independently confessed their love to me and told me how much they love the other. It was arousing, it was powerful, it made me feel a much stronger connection to both of them.

Without expecting it, we managed to fall madly in love, she and I.  After the first month, and a few trips, stumbles, and many many conversations, I find myself part of a poly with her as the ""hinge"" and me as the ""secondary"".

All three of us have been adjusting as well as can be expected - there has been lots of jealousy and the errant ""taking something said the wrong way"", but overall we are all growing, changing, and adjusting very nicely and very happily.  Although I don't have any romantic feelings for her primary, he is a helluva guy and I love him to pieces.

**So, I wanted to extend a conversation toward those others that find themselves in my shoes as a secondary partner (passionately in love, but physically living outside the primary relationship).  Tell stories, give advice, ask for advice, etc.**

----

I suppose I'll start with what I'm going through at the moment.  I have somewhat recently separated from my wife of nearly a decade (nothing to do with the poly - everything to do with finding myself cowering in the corner of an abusive marriage and finding the courage to pack my bags).  I now live in a very nice house that I was very fortunate to stumble into renting - crazy-cheap rent, my landlady mostly just wants a caretaker to make sure the pipes don't burst in the winter.  So, the difficult parts for me come into play emotionally during my SO and I's ""off days"" when she's with her Primary.

It's not so much jealousy when she's with him, it's being in a big house all alone for the first time in my life.  All my life, I've been with roommates, girlfriends, or my wife... I've never come home to a quiet house and maintained no verbal communication until I get to work the next day, and it's rough.  I hate an empty bed... as bad as my marriage became, I'm still very emotionally pained by an empty bed.  So, those nights are rough, but as time goes on, it is steadily becoming better.  I have good days and bad days, but the bad ones are fewer and farther-between all the time.

I'm 32 and in a relationship with a poly guy that, for about 6 of our first 8 years together, was challenging and has been off and on for a lot of that time because of my challenges with mono/poly. I've gone from being monogamous to being open and caring for my metamours. Over the past year, I was away from the family for a couple months. However the last few months I've been back, things are strong and I've been enjoying my relationship with my boy and our family. I only told my parents recently that I was back together with them all when I was feeling ready to tell them. 

My boy is smart and lovely and I know I have something with him I won't find in anyone else. The girls are wonderful and sweet and I couldn't ask for more.

So for the amusement of all of you here in r/poly, here's the email my mom sent me. She can barely use a computer so it's not exactly written well. Over the past couple weeks I've tried to explain to my parents that my relationship is loving, caring, and good, and that I'm happy with my boy and our girlfriends.

The rules help in the short term, but surprise, surprise, poly partners want freedom. Being equal is basically impossible. Trying to balance the books just jacks up the stress levels.

For various reason's the relationship didn't work out.

When I started dating this new girl my house mate became paranoid that she was going to be replaced.

She saw this new girl as invading that dynamic and replacing her role in it - actually superseding it as there was also a sexual attraction.

We didn't have sex (I was on my period) and I didn't remember to bring them up to him until yesterday (3 days later). On further inspection, we're pretty sure they are molluscum contagiosum, which isn't a death sentence or anything, but still definitely an STI.

He has only been with one other partner recently that I haven't also been with. I know I don't have any symptoms, and I am positive this other woman we have both been with doesn't either. That leaves the other partner, a woman who I thought I was fine with him being with... but we all spent time together last weekend and she engaged in some other behaviors that made me VERY uncomfortable (and I think may have made him reconsider his wish to spend time around her).

He says they've only had protected sex, and I don't see any reason not to believe him, but I'm still angry. Is this irrational? I'm not necessarily angry with him, but I am with her. This is an obvious enough thing you would think she would be aware of the situation.

Anyway, now the two of us are not having sex until he gets a definitive diagnosis and treatment, which won't happen until Monday at the earliest. I've asked him to get a complete STI screen, and I'm a little frightened of what else might turn up.

It's a new relationship, but he seems to have already slipped and fallen into a fling with a monogamous girl.  I'm still a rookie myself and I know this is a total mess.  Tonight the inevitable ""if you're serious about me then dump your girlfriend"" ultimatum went down, and he rushed off to try to explain in person why valuing our relationship and his own freedom doesn't diminish how much he values their connection as well.  Everyone's being civil, but there's lots of hurt going around.  We've talked extensively about situations like this in theory, but he's currently learning the hard way how things like this often go.

The crazy thing is, while I'm sick with worry over the fact that my sweetie is in pain over this, I'm not scared.  I trust that he does value me and our relationship.  With the emotional skills I've learned through reading books, lurking and throwaways accounts here, and practice over the past year, I figured out how to identify and ask for exactly what I need to feel safe and loved in this crisis, and the only turmoil I'm left with while I'm sitting here at home is worrying about what my best friend must be going through.  I learned how to feel real trust in my partner and how to face the fact that if that trust is misplaced, I will still be okay.

Afterwords both said it felt right and sex was back on the table. I was shocked and happy.

Unicorn came and brought me something at work today and as we were kissing goodbye, she told me that she's fallen in love with me. This is something she's never said before... always that she loved me. This about brought me to tears. She said that she's taking this all one step at a time, but she can see herself wearing OUR ring someday.

It's a sincere question.  At any real-life meetup, or okcupid search, it seems like a larger percentage of poly people are overweight or obese than the general population.

Is there a large intersection between the poly subculture and fat positive subcultures?  Do poly people ""let themselves go"" because they don't have to satisfy one partner?  Is this something that other people have noticed, or do you think I am imagining it?  

Please tell me your thoughts.  In any dating scene, physical attraction is important, and I'm finding myself having a hard time attracted to the poly people I meet because of this.

How to make this work? ,44,7,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/t6gcf/advised_to_post_here_in_a_relationship_with_two/,"I posted this in /r/relationships and was told to post here. This was my [old thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/t673n/in_a_relationship_with_two_women_at_once_can_this/)

This may get a little long so apologies in advance. **I'm 34/m. My wife is 32/f. My girlfriend is 25/f**. I feel like there is no where I can post about my situation without being judged. **Been married to my wife for 5.5 years.** I love her to death. **We have a daughter, 4, and a son, 2**. A couple years ago my wife had a health issue (after our son was born) and gave me the blessing to seek out a FWB. That is how I met my girlfriend.

We tried to keep things casual but as usual thing never go as planned. I fell for her and her for me. She had an issue with her housing situation about six months after we started hooking up and I offered to let her rent a room at our house. My wife's health concern was resolved but I still had feelings for my girlfriend. My wife agreed to let my girlfriend stay at our home but wanted us to cut out our relationship. We tried and failed. And to complicate matters my girlfriend ended up pregnant. She wanted to keep the baby and we came clean to my wife. My wife was heartbroken at me for violating her trust but she consented to letting her stay at home and we have fallen into a bit of a routine. **Girlfriend ended up being pregnant with twins who are now 6 months**. Both boys and just bundles of joy. My wife loves those kids like her own and I am a good father to them.

The problem I have is I am in love with both my wife and my girlfriend and could never imagine giving either of them up. I am on great terms with them both and we have a make-shift situation that kind of works. Its not perfect and we constantly have issues. The major fights we have are

- **Jealousy &amp; Intimacy**: Kind of a huge one and obvious. My wife thinks she has more of a right to me since she is my wife. This breeds resentment from my girlfriend. Girlfriend isn't perfect either and will purposely do things that bother my wife. I don't sleep with anyone either than my wife or girlfriend. Girlfriend has a slightly higher drive so I am with her a little more but its close to even. There is no sex with anyone else other than me. And if you are curious there is zero sexual attraction between my wife and girlfriend.

- **Public perception**: I almost have to keep my girlfriend and twins a secret. I love them but there is no way for us to do things in public. This is kind of a burden.

- **Family fights**: Both my girlfriend and wife are good mothers and they love all the children as their own. They work together well but there are jealousy problems that come through. There is sort of an issue of our extended families not understanding at all. My reputation has gone to shit with my wife's family as a result of this.

I'm not sure where we stand legally. I assume I am fine and no one would care but I do get some snide comments from people that know about everything. I'm the only working member of the household and I do well. I run my own business and bring in between $200-300k a year. My wife hasn't worked in a number of years and with the babies its hard for my girlfriend to work. We probably don't need their income anyways. 4 little kids are expensive but we aren't starving. I think its sustainable long term. My wife is pushing for another baby which probably will happen so that is another expense. I have some nerves about that but I have been good about saving and being cost conscious. Of our worries its the least.

I'm just completely nervous and scared that this isn't going to work. Most marriages don't last. How can my completely screwed up situation work? I doubt anyone has been in my exact situation but some advice on how to proceed and how to make this work fluidly would be appreciated. I'm not sure of how traditional of a forum this is since its my first post but I swear I am a good guy even though my marriage situation may not make much sense. I've tried looking for guidance with people in open marriages but ours isn't really open. My wife and girlfriend aren't sleeping with other people and I'm not sleeping with anyone other than them. I never planned this out so I'm sort of just figuring things out on the fly.

It's kind of hard to explain, the simplest way to put it is that she wants the unity of a couple but with a third person.

Her and I have a child together and plan to have several more. It has been my desire to have a family with her since we were children. She had told me last night that she also wants to see me father children with another woman, so that we can both be there for her while shes pregnant and raise all of our children together. I know her well enough to know when she is talking utter nonsense, but there is serious conviction in this. 

Sexually she wants us to be able to experience true bliss. She doesn't want us to just have threesomes for the sake of making things exciting, she wants us to be able to make love as three people. To be able to expand the boundaries of what we've been shown to be normal by society. 

This is something I have only dreamed about, I've never put any serious thought in to it because I thought this wasn't possible. She wants this for herself clearly and I'm not ignorant to that fact, but she also legitimately wants this for me. Her exact words were ""I love you so much and even if I give you the world I still want more for you. I want you to have 2 women to love you so you can never be let down. I think that people say there is something missing all the time, because they just have not looked to this. Maybe that is what everyone is missing."" 

Now a typical guys thoughts would immediately be ""sweet, nightly threesomes!!!"" but this is the last place my mind went to. I don't know what to think, I'm absolutely amazed. I get that we will have to overcome jealousy and favoritism and what not, I'm very wary of any complications we may run into. This also isn't something we will be going after tomorrow, it will be a long process. I know we risk being ostracized by our families and other parents from our children's school when they get to be that age. I know people will look at us in public in confusion or sheer disgust, but if we can achieve happiness this way then all of that will be trivial. 

Few questions for you reddit.

Is there a set term for this? I know about polyamory, polygamy, polygyny and the likes but I'm not sure if this fits in to those categories.

How would we go about finding someone to do this with us? 

What are your honest thoughts on this proposal?

Is this something any of you have ever thought about doing? I would love to hear what you have to say.

Anybody with experience with this?

I will also be posting this in the polyamory subreddit so I can get their views on the subject. I'd like the views of the rest of reddit as well so that is why I'm posting this here.

TL;DR The misses wants to expand our relationship to three people (MFF), for the sake of everyone being loved more. not just for threesomes.

Please ignore me/ flame me into oblivion if you think I’m just being inappropriate or lazy, but offending people is absolutely not my intention!)

Now that’s out of the way, let me explain myself… I'm a student making a documentary about polyamory in the UK, and this subreddit has just been a complete inspiration and a great resource. But I want to pick your brains:

Is there a particular aspect of the poly lifestyle/ poly relationships you wish more people new about?  Or a false assumption lots of people seem to make, that you wish you could overturn?  Is there one thing standing in the way of more people coming out?  And would any UK-based Polys like to be a part of my piece, by speaking to me in person?  I’d LOVE to hear from anyone at all, really, but especially if you’re in a long term relationship, or have children, or feel you can’t come out for whatever reason.

Just to explain a little more about the project: I'm actually making two pieces side by side.  Firstly, I'm doing an MA in Broadcast Journalism and as part of my assessment I have to make a very short (10 minute) social documentary for radio.  I want to focus on both the existence of, and the acceptance/ understanding of polyamorous relationships in the UK.  At the same time, I am also making a much longer and broader piece more generally themed around changing modern attitudes to fidelity and monogamy, and as well as polyamorous people I also hope to speak to a range of other contributors (for example people who used 'married-cheating' dating websites, swingers, members of various religious organizations, etc).  I want to focus on the idea of ethics within non-monogamy, and particularly on the concept of long-term, family oriented non-monogamous groups (with or without children), as I think this is a really interesting angle which is not covered so often in the media.  I’ve also set up an interview with a marriage historian, who I’m hoping can talk a little about the social history of monogamy, and the transition between ‘marriage as a socio-economic contract’ to ‘marriage as an expression of romantic love’. This second piece is nothing directly to do with my studies, but I am hoping to pitch it to various radio stations (with the help of my tutors) once it's finished.  Sorry to bore you with tedious detail, but I thought it might help to know what kind of piece I’m aiming at.

Aaaaaand a little more about myself? OK, I’m 26, Londoner, f, I’m actually in a monogamous relationship at the moment but polyamory is something I’ve felt an affiliation with ever since I first heard about it – I’ve felt something akin to compersion but had no word for it until recently.  Bit of a lightening bolt moment when I first saw it defined.  I’ve been working in radio for around three years, but came back to education last year to qualify as a ‘proper’ journalist.

ALL help and opinions very gratefully received!

TL;DR:
Is there a particular aspect of the poly lifestyle/ poly relationships you wish more people new about?
Or a false assumption lots of people seem to make, that you wish you could overturn?
And is there one thing standing in the way of more people coming out?

Oh, also, GF is here on Reddit, and will probably see this, so *waves* hi honey!! :P 

So, yesterday it felt like my entire body was in a revolt against me. Internal organs have not been cooperative with the desire for sexy times. I got a butt cramp (hamstring) at my workout. And I was drained from finals. Add to that, my therapy appointment was later that night. I was just...done. So, GF invites me over to their place before the appointment, and I got showered with loves and care and food and laughs. It was just so awesome to know that they've both got my back. I've never really had that, so sometimes it takes me a while to realize that these amazing people are actually here for me. I just hope that I can be as much of a support to them as they are to me. 

Add to all that...next week is their anniversary, but the date falls on our regular weekly sleepovers. Instead of switching the night of our sleepover, they're going to celebrate their anniversary together on another night. At first I was horrified and felt awful about it, but then it was like...omg...they really like me!!!

1321689211.0,35,self.polyamory,mhw58,I am a single male and I had a different kind of evening last night.  (Date with another man’s sub.)  ,36,1,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/mhw58/i_am_a_single_male_and_i_had_a_different_kind_of/,"TL;DR:  Woman I was with last night is apparently a true sub.  While between the proverbial sheets, she had her BF who lives a thousand miles away on speaker phone the entire time talking dirty and dictating many of her actions.  It was strange but at the same time, very erotic.  

The lead up:  I am a single male swinger in my mid 40’s.  I am on a popular swinging web site.  (SLS.)  I like sex with women and MF couples.  I got a random message on that site out of nowhere from a woman who liked what I said in my profile and wanted to meet me.  (SCORE!)  We exchanged some notes and then we talked on the phone and progressed to the next level.  We met for lunch.  We really did hit it off.  There was good chemistry between us.  She mentioned she had a regular partner who lives a good thousand miles away and that they meet about six times a year and that she keeps him in the loop on what she does sexually when he is not around.  She has been with him for about 4 years.  I had no problem with any of that.    

We met last night and had dinner before going to my place.  During dinner, she mentioned her partner, how she talked to him about me, how he gave her his permission to carry this out among other things.  We talked about limits, boundaries, likes and all of that.  When we decided to go to my place, she did mention she was going to call him and let him listen.  I was cool with that.  

In the bedroom.  Clothes off.  She calls him.  Speaker phone is on.  Him and I exchange the obligatory ‘what’s up bro’.  He acknowledged me with a smile in his voice.  He had a Southern, baritone drawl.  (Think Trace Adkins.)  After that, he and I really did not talk.  

During our encounter, I had free rein over her in what I wanted her to do.  She also was fine with dictating to me what she wanted.  She submitted to whatever I asked.  She was fine with that.  She was also very vocal.  She also dictated the action as she wanted at the moment.  But her partner was also dictating the shots over the phone from her end as well.  (Seriously, everything he told her to do was fine by me.)  I would be eating her and he would tell her to blow me.  (Fine by me.)  She was fucking me with her on top and he told her to have me fuck her missionary.  (Fine by me.)  We kissed on and off throughout.  But then he would tell her to kiss me and she did.  (Fine by me.)  I was fucking her from behind and he told her to have me fuck her in the ass.  (Fine by me!)  

This really did happen and I am honestly not bragging.  I have observed the master/sub dynamics before.  But this is the most extreme I have ever seen.  Very little freaks me out as far as sex goes.  But this was more than a little bit strange to me.  

Has anyone else ever experienced something similar?

1318567303.0,33,self.polyamory,lbpji,Update 2: I'm turned on by the idea of him sleeping with other women (Originally in r/sex),37,4,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/lbpji/update_2_im_turned_on_by_the_idea_of_him_sleeping/,"Well, if you read through my posts, this was originally a bit more of a threesome/swingers thing. I think at this point, it's most appropriate here.

My boyfriend is at my friend's house right now, and has been for several hours. It's the first time that anything sexual has occurred between him and another woman without my presence. It took a lot of talking and boundary-setting to get to this point, but right now... it feels good. I'm anxious for him to get home so I can hear the details :)

It's crazy to me to think that just a few months ago, all we were doing was talking about threesomes. Then we had the threesome (although I don't really consider it an ""official"" threesome, as my friend and I are not interested in each other sexually and were just giving it a shot to see if it was hot or not... not so much for either of us). Now we've moved on to him being able to take my friend on dates every now and then. 

I've found that the most important thing for me is feeling that it's cooperative between the friend and I rather than competitive. She's VERY respectful of boundaries and makes it clear that there is no ""boyfriend stealing"" element here. She likes sex, my boyfriend is hot, and I'm happy that they're both happy. I know she has no interest in dating him, and that my... position, if you want to call it that... is not at risk. 

It's been a strange voyage of self-discovery and not without its hiccups, but I think our relationship is closer, stronger, and *definitely* hotter for it. 

Plus, my single friend gets some great sex and cuddling out of the deal :)

Anyway, just had to share. We'll see where it goes from here. It's been a fun ride, and I think we did it in a way that's right for us. 

Thanks for reading :) I'd love to answer any questions about how this progressed, if there are any... the only two people I can talk about this with are my boyfriend and the friend. I've been dying to tell someone!

I realize, given the plethora of ""unicorn chasers=bad"" and ""that's polyfuckery/swinging"" posts lately, that maybe this is now off-topic. Whatever; I posted before and I wanted to update you all.

I had a ""date"" (hookup) with her last night. 

We'd flirted online all weekend long, and set up a date for last night which was pretty openly a FWB hookup. 

We established in advance the logistics that I'd come over and she and I would hang out and maybe play for a while before he might arrive. At that point, I would decide my comfort level and see where it went. I was already clear that I wouldn't be participating with him, but I didn't want to outlaw the idea of staying to watch, since I know that's her kink.

Being with her was fantastic. It was my first experience with a woman, and it affirmed what I've long felt: I am definitely not straight. It was lovely, and tender, and we had a tremendous amount of fun.

He let her know he was coming over, so I had a few minutes to think about how I felt and what I was comfortable with. I decided I was more comfortable with my clothes on, so I got dressed. He showed up and they began having sex. I touched her while they were having fun, but I had already been clear that this wasn't a FMF threesome. Really, more like a MF with a friendly third wheel.

Overall, it was a good night. I never felt coerced or uncomfortable, and my boundaries were respected. I could have left at any time, and after a while, we all took a little break and I decided I would leave so they could have some alone time.

And for those who were concerned for my safety: I drank a sealed bottled water that I took with me even when I went to the bathroom so it was never unattended.

Later, I talked to my husband about the whole experience. I had checked in with him earlier as well, and he was fine. He's either not jealous, or he's a really good liar. I've known him for 16 years and have never known him to lie about anything, including his emotions, so I'm going with ""not jealous."" But I continue to check his comfort levels as well as my own.

I don't think this is going to be a long-term thing. We're not that compatible, and I'm pretty sure they realize that, too. But for short term fun, I guess you could say ""everything went better than expected.""",,False,self,t5_2qu5n,False,,,True,t3_jel0g,http://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/jel0g/i_like_you_not_your_boyfriend_update/,

This will be long. But it helps me to write it and for you to know most of the story.


First some backstory. My wife and I met in the mid-90’s when we were both in high school. We did not live in the same state, but we had an intense connection. Even though she was dating someone at the time, we began a long-distance relationship. This continued for many years and we each dated other people while we communicated over the phone/internet. Finally we got together during college, even though it was still long distance, we were seeing each other at least once a month, and she lived  with me through the summers. 


Before college, I proposed, and we set a date immediately after our graduations. We married, and moved across the country to start our married lives. We were mostly happy, with a few small problems, but one thing was bigger than the rest: our sex life was not great. That is mostly my fault. I had reasons, including a lower libido from a bad diet and no exercise. I also watched too much porn, which I lied about. My wife wanted sex all the time, and that should have been great, but for some reason it wasn’t working. She thought I found her unattractive, which damaged her self esteem. She was wrong about that, but the damage was done.


As a result our relationship suffered. I wasn’t as supportive of her as I should have been, and she was lonely. Neither of us are particularly good at making new friends, and we had moved to a place neither of us had really ever been. Suffice it to say that we fell into a rut of being more roommates than husband and wife. 


Skip to the end of last year. She had been reaching out to old friends on facebook to ease her loneliness. In the process, she found an ex-boyfriend she dated briefly when she was very young, we’re talking 6th grade. She began talking to him on facebook constantly, sending him photos (innocent ones at first). All the while she insisted that they were just friends. Based on her past of starting new relationships before ending current ones, I should have seen the writing on the wall and attempted to end it right away. But I could see that she was less lonely, and so I let it continue. At some point I got too uncomfortable with it and asked her to end it, and it led to one of the first conversations that truly showed how much trouble our marriage was in. 


She was unable to stop talking to him, but insisted it was just that they were really good friends and she was lonely. There wasn’t much I could do at that point but to try to improve as a husband so that she didn’t need him to fill a void in her life. 


The next blow occurred several months later when she attended a wedding in the same city that her ex lived in. I had just started a new job, and had no vacation time to go with her. I had my suspicions when she returned that she had spent more time with the ex than she let on, and eventually my suspicions were founded when she told me she was going back “to get some space and find herself.” I confronted her, and eventually she admitted she was considering leaving me, and she was going back to her ex to see if he was who she truly wanted. We fought, but it was clear that I had to let her go to him, otherwise she would probably have just left me then and there. She spent three weeks with him. I won’t go into details, but she decided to come back to me with the intention of giving us another chance. This was good news, but there was a looming deadline. This fall, she would make a final decision. Our sex had improved greatly, but there has been so much damage to our relationship and trust that it has been hard to try and rebuild. The other obstacle was that she still talked to him daily, which made it more difficult to invest fully in each other. 


This past week we had another discussion about our relationship. I told her that she had to stop talking to him if she was serious about saving our marriage. She said she couldn’t. She had tried, but it hurt too much. She was also afraid of losing him, in case we couldn’t salvage our marriage. It was then that she brought up the subject of polyandry. She had mentioned it before, but both he and I had laughed it off as insane. We discussed it, and she begged me to try it, just for a week. We both share common interests, and under different circumstances, we could be good friends. She said that even if I agreed to it, he would not likely go for it, and if he didn’t, she would know that I was more committed than he was, and she would end things with him. I thought about it, and came to the conclusion that it was the only thing to do. I held a large amount of the blame of pushing her away and into his arms, but I was not about to throw away over 12 years of my life without trying everything. I agreed to let him come to our house to stay for a week to see if it is an option worth even exploring. She was visibly excited at the prospect. 


She set to the task of convincing him to come here to try it. At first he was as reluctant as I was, if not more so. Nothing she said to him made any difference, he wasn’t interested in sharing her. I sympathized. He has a chance at a normal life, a normal relationship, and she is asking him to pick up and move here to share our lives in an arrangement that society considers anything but normal.  She was devastated, but not surprised at the result. She was obviously having difficulty taking no for an answer. She called him with me standing next to her, to ask him one last time. He wasn’t giving in. Finally, I asked if I could talk to him. She handed me the phone. We spoke for the first time, and it went very, very differently than I expected. We got along. From the beginning. I told him that if he truly wanted to be with my wife, this was the only way to make it work. I told her that it is possible that neither one of us could ever be enough for her by ourselves, but perhaps we could together.I told him that we were already essentially sharing her, but this way she would actually be happy about it. I told him that I believed we could be friends, and that he had nothing to lose by trying, other than maybe his dignity (which I was already giving up by having that conversation). I explained why I had agreed to it. That I loved my wife, I loved my life with her, and I was willing to do anything for her except let her go. That I could not live with myself if I just walked away from her without trying everything I could. That in a lot of ways, it makes sense to me (but in a lot of ways, it doesn’t at all). He finally agreed. 


This was two days ago. Since then, my wife has been happier than I have seen her in years, and our sex life has been great. She is being open and honest with me, and for the first time I have hope that we can rebuild our relationship. But I am still scared out of my mind. What if it works? What if it doesn’t?


Now for my questions: Am I an idiot? Am I a foolish, naive, desperate idiot? Or am I just doing whatever I can to save my marriage and continue being with the love of my life? Could this work? Is it possible for both of us to have an equal relationship with her? There are endless logistical and emotional questions to work through if we decide to pursue this after our week-long trial period, but I wanted to get some advice from impartial (and anonymous) sources. 


TL:DR - My wife of 5 years had an affair and wants to have him move in with us as a second husband. I have agreed to test out this option to bring her happiness and save our relationship.

We have had some major breakthroughs and I think this weekend was the biggest one. 



My wife always gets super nervous around A, and instead of isolating herself she spent an entire evening with both A and I watching old Twilight Zone episodes and doctor who episodes. It was awkward at first but eventually everyone kind of came into their own and I started cuddling both of them. We ended up talking and cuddling until 3 in the morning and A spent the night at our house. I cooked breakfast for everyone the next day and we all hung out for about an hour before A had to leave.

My new boyfriend's boundaries are even stricter than when my fiancee and I were mono. Communication is an incredible chore and I'm afraid that my boyfriend isn't really ok with polyamory at all.
Have I just been spoiled up until now? Is it normal to 'close' your relationship for a while when you start dating someone new?**

I'll keep this as brief as possible, I'm writing this to get some external perspectives from all of the wonderful folk here in /r/polyamory - and hopefully sort my thoughts out for myself.

I've(20F) been with my fiancee(22M) for four years. We have lived together for three and a half years, and lived independently for the last two. Our relationship is like titanium, we are a perfect match and there are no obstacles we can't overcome. We're both happy and proud to identify as polyamorous, although with his current time constraints he's not seeing anyone other than me.(Despite my best efforts, too.)

I also have a fledgling relationship with my boyfriend(21M). We've been officially dating for a week, but acting like a couple for about 4 months. We spend about two nights a week together. We went to school together, and have been friends for about 5 years.

Communication has been a bit of an issue between myself and my BF, as we both communicate and process things very differently. I think out loud and need to bounce ideas off of people, whereas he prefers to go away, think and come back with a complete answer. (Or, go away, play video games and put the question in the 'too hard' box.)

**Now that I've established the situation, here's where it gets messy:**

I had a house party on Saturday, nothing too crazy. However when I get drunk I get very flirty, kissy and huggy. With everyone. I've been like this for as long as I can remember, and it was never an issue with my fiancee. It becomes a bit of a joke about how many people I kiss at parties.

However, my boyfriend was not happy. In fairness, we'd never really talked about rules and boundaries. He knows what rules I have with my fiancee and he's never brought it up - I assumed the same rules went from him. (I know, assuming = wrong move)
For clarity, my fiancee and I have an agreement whereby we are each free to lead our own lives so long as we talk about it first. So if I go out with friends, I'll first check with him that he's OK with me going home with someone else, just in case the opportunity arises.

So the other night, I was hooking up with a friend and he was pretty clearly interested in going further. I wasn't interested, and i let him know that. But then I realised that my boyfriend and I had never talked about boundaries. So I told him about my friend and asked how he felt about that. He said he wouldn't be comfortable with me sleeping with other people, and he wasn't comfortable that we'd kissed. The next day we talked a bit more, and he said he also felt uncomfortable when I was affectionate with my fiancee and he was in the same room.*(This actually made me a bit angry, although I didn't react.)*

I talked with my fiancee about this, and we each had different opinions. I, being hopeful and optimistic, thought that my relationship with my boyfriend is still very young and he's probably just not entirely secure. That's perfectly understandable, and I can try to help him feel more secure. My fiancee thinks that my boyfriend has been in love with me for years and wants me all to himself. (My bf has definitely had at least a crush on me for a number of years)

Tonight I had a conversation with my boyfriend about my concerns. (After many 'maybes' and 'not sures') We ended up here:

* I can love my fiancee, that's fine(That's how he put it)
* He can't compel me to change my promiscuous ways(Also how he put it)
* He's 'not sure' whether he's ok with me hooking up with people at parties
* He's 'not sure' whether he's ok with me possibly dating other people in the future

I think my fiancee was right, and my boyfriend is just hoping that I'll fall wistfully into his arms and never want for another man or woman again.

He and I are such good friends, and I care for him an awful lot. I'm quite happy to restrain myself for a few months while we get our footing and find our place in each other's lives. My fiancee and I have had some quite serious discussions about future plans, and the possibility of the three of us living together. I know it's early on, but I wanted to be clear with my fiancee what options I had and what our five year plan might look like. True to form, my incredible fiancee and I ended up talking about the possibility of the three of us living together, and having children etc. My fiancee did not set any boundaries or constraints for my new relationship.

I want to address this head-on ASAP.

More than anything I just wanted to get this clearly written down, and talked over with some people who know their shit. Please, let your thoughts and opinions fly. I really don't want things to end with my boyfriend, but when I put on my 'Realism Goggles' it's starting to look like the most likely course of action.

Edit: Although my bf and I have a sort of running joke about our imaginary future house &amp; I've made it clear that my fiance is a part of that dream, we've never had any serious conversations about the future.

Edit/Update:
Thank you all so much for your input. My boyrfriend and I went through this thread and talked about it last night. This is all very new to him(and me as well, honestly) so we've decided to wait and see, and I'm quite happy to be ""closed"" for a couple of months, while he gets settled. We've also decided to see each other more often, which will be really nice.

We have been friends for over a year before that. When we decided to venture into the intimate zone, I sat down with his wife and we had a good long talk about rules and regulations (he was there too, of course). It was awkward but we came to a few agreements around safety and comfort zones which I won't get into too heavily. Little did I know that the first time the gentleman and I would sleep together would turn out to be incredibly explosive and passionate. I felt like I was 16 again and couldn't get him out of my head. Not to sound too cliche, but I couldn't eat or sleep or even get through the day with out feeling this incredible desire for him. 

So, last night was our date night and after many mind-blowing rounds of sex, he asked me if I felt anything more for him than purely sexual desire. I had been trying to keep my feelings contained so as not to complicate matters, but I couldn't lie to this person. I tried to play it off with ""so what does it matter if I do?"". He wasn't going to leave it there and eventually ferreted it out of me that I was in love with him. This was something I hadn't even really admitted to myself yet but as soon as I said it out loud I couldn't take it back nor deny it any longer.

So the shit went down between he and his wife this morning. Apparently, she had not mentioned the no-falling-in-love rule to either of us. She asked him how everything went and he told her what I had confessed the night before. I'm still waiting for the call to tell me how the discussion went but when I last talked to him, she had stormed out of the house and sent some hurt and confused texts in her wake. 

I'm sick and shaky. I feel like I should never have said anything and just kept my feelings to myself and enjoyed what I had while I had it. I'm sick for him and her both. I feel terrible for her! I understand that kind of hurt that she's feeling and would do anything to make it better. I want to just hug them both and assure them that what they have together is beautiful and that my stupid feelings can't destroy their bond. I can't though, I have to just sit here and wait for the call. 

I don't know what to do with myself. 

Update: Thank you everyone for being so supportive. I'm still in a bit of a bad spot but I feel better with so much honesty from everyone. I got the call and the wife has reneged the open relationship status as far as I'm concerned. That hurts a lot. Maybe you guys are right and she wasn't quite ready for everything an open relationship entails. She didn't want to talk to me, so I'm getting all of this second hand through him, but I'm going to take all of your wonderful advice and just focus on myself for awhile.

I tried telling her to look at her hypocrisy. I tried pointing out that she was using the *exact same arguments that we brush off from the anti-gay crowd*. But she was having none of it. What really pissed me off was when she said ""Marriage is about commitment."" I could *feel* the steam coming out my ears.

My husband is mono, so while I could be poly, being mono isn't a deal breaker. And I'm pan/bi. My mom took a little while to accept me as bi, but to actually hear such dismissive, ignorant statements from her just floored me! 

The only vindication I felt was after she essentially said that thing about commitment again, and scoffed at ""polyamory,"" and I responded with:

""So, did you love me dad?"" They've been divorced since I was five, 23 years ago.

I have no interest in multiple relationships myself, but I seem to utterly lack the emotion of sexual jealousy (seriously, I have no idea how it's meant to feel), and have no stake in my partner remaining monogamous.  

My wife (coming up 12 years now) never quite took me seriously on this - she assumed I was either being a bit of a poser, or that I was looking for an out for myself. 

Until a couple of weeks back, she pulled me aside and confessed that she'd fooled around with a guy at a party. 

My reaction was basically ""Cool! How was it?"", mixed with a big chunk of awww at how guilty she felt about it. 

It was actually pretty funny: ""but... but I... but most guys would... well, I mean I would have been pretty pissed off if you'd got all pissy about it, but *still*!"" 

A bit of mutual reassurance later, and we're all more than cool about it - in fact, I think our relationship is doing better than it has been in a while. 

And meantime, I've got this huge grin on my face: 

* I *knew* I wasn't just affecting this attitude - validation! 
* I know for sure now that I'm completely immune to that pointless, destructive emotion and all the anxiety that goes with it.
* She's seems so much more  growed-up and cosmopolitan-like, now. She saw it, she wanted it, she took it, without (what always seemed to me to be) concern for petty, pointless restrictions. I'm so proud of her! 

It's funny, my mind keeps wondering about all kinds of past and present things about it; I can see how this could eat a person alive if they had a problem with it. 

The other intriguing thing is, I discovered when I was about 30, the subject never having come up before, that my dad is exactly the same way. ""Someone once asked what I'd do if I found my wife in bed with another man... ask him how he takes his coffee, I guess.""

We have some poly friends, and so the discussion of whether to be poly/mono was discussed in earnest pretty early into things. Due to some jealousy issues on her part, general trust issues on my end, we opted out and decided to have a ""closed"" relationship.

Fast forward a about 5 years, and she is working for a company online with employees scattered about. A coworker (f) starts flirting casually, and my partner eventually tells me she kind of has a crush. So we re-evaluate our situation and feel like we can give this a shot.

I've had maybe five lovers during that time - all wonderful, accepting and amazing men who have enriched my life beyond measure and I continue to love everyone of them, whether I still see them frequently or not.  My husband has had relationships with perhaps five times that many women, though they tended to be short lived and primarily physical interactions for him.  We have dabbled in sharing our partners, but our extramarital relationships have largely been independent of each other.

Naturally there have been many points over the years where we have assessed, negotiated and discussed our needs and how we felt our relationship was going and we have always managed to navigate any difficulties or problems relating to each other's choices with maturity, respect and acceptance of one another - we never fight or raise our voices (except sometimes over the knucklehead stuff, like whose turn it is to do the dishes  :S).  I've always thought our marriage was strong, honest, open, full of trust and acceptance.

His therapist has dragged up a lot of negative thoughts he has towards his childhood and feelings of being unimportant to his parents, particularly his mother - a fact that is unfortunately still all too evident to this day.  He is really struggling with many of these deep rooted psychological issues, but he has also somehow has come to the conclusion that our open marriage has never made him happy, and he now wants/needs a monogamous relationship.

He says sharing me with other men has always made him feel unimportant but that he 'put up with it' because being open and honest about my attractions towards other people was a large part of who I am.  Part of me feels that he can't do anything about the entrenched situation with his parents and he's floundering a bit, looking for things that he thinks he can control.

I'm really confused and don't want to see my marriage breakdown.  I also have a wonderful lover who I have known for the past five years who my husband is effectively asking me to cut out of my life.  I feel like he is giving me ultimatums, and is ripping the rug out from under our relationship.  The idea of trying to be monogamous and 'switch off' how I feel towards others seems unnatural and I don't know how, or if, this is even doable for me... I certainly know it's not what I want.  But I love my husband very deeply and don't know what to do.   I'm in shock.

I would not give this book to someone curious about polyamorous relationships because I feel it is laden with the authors' emotional biases which give a version of polyamory that I don't feel applies to me. I didn't relate to the authors own anecdotes very much and when stitched together, it made polyamory look great in theory, a train wreck of heartache in practice. It seems to me that free agency is prized in the book over stability and commitment and there was some wishy washy spirituality nonsense that got my back up as well.

I didn't relate to the authors I guess.

Any one have any thoughts on this or the book itself?

After much discussion, my B and I decided to pursue separate relationships. B and I had a one penis policy, as this started out with her accepting that she is bisexual and wanting to explore that. 

Our first night out after deciding to open up, I found someone rather quickly who I am very compatible with. I thought I was ready for it and so did my wife. Nothing happened between me and the new woman, we'll call her M, the first night except some dancing and a couple kisses here and there. 

Over the next three weeks, B and I had several several conversations regarding where our marriage was heading, what the end value was for our marriage if we followed through with this, etc.. During this time, M and I were texting and sending a few pics back and forth with full honesty of what we were doing, amongst all parties involved.

Then it dawned on me... It is unfair and selfish for the one penis policy to stand, and after much internal struggle, we decided to let it drop. Never before have I felt so inadequate and insecure. Not just gradually, absolutely immediately after agreeing to it, the idea of my wife having sex, doing the things with her and to her that I do, visions rushed through my head.

B and I both agreed that maybe we aren't as open minded as we thought.

I'm sure I already know the answer, but sometimes its cathartic just writing out feelings so here it goes.

My wife and I just started down the poly road. We've been together for 10 years and everything's great between us. She's also dating one of mutual friends. He's an awesome guy who I trust and frankly I'm glad they have their relationship. Without going into it he can give her things that I can't. So the relationship is mutually beneficial.

They spend a couple of nights a week together, sometimes more, sometimes less. It depends on what his wife and her boyfriend are doing, etc. Anyway, I'm in no way jealous of their relationship, or of the time she spends away from me, etc. I'm really happy for them.

 Where the jealousy bug bites me is that I don't have anyone when they're off doing their thing and I'm just jealous that she has someone and I don't. I'll admit that I'm whining about it. The problem is that we have a small open/poly group in our town and either everyone is partnered, or I'm just not interested in those that aren't. And the one person I am interested in wants a mono relationship, even though there are feelings between us.

So, I know the answer to my delimma is to find someone, but I'm stuck because I don't know if there's anyone to find. Okcupid hasn't been helpful. Bah, I guess I'll just have to keep my eyes open.

My husband is out of town for a few weeks so I'm using the time to sort out some scary thoughts I've been having.

We were both poly before we met, and it was one of the things that made me feel like he was a good life partner. We were both so committed to being poly, no matter what other people thought or said. We had good experiences and bad experiences, together and separately.

Now I'm getting older (rounding 30) and we are expecting our first baby. And I am feeling myself do a complete and total 180. I don't want to be poly any more.

I am sure a big part of it is hormones. Unlike so many other pregnant women, I have not had a crazy libido...exactly the opposite. I've gone from a once-a-day-er to never, if it can possibly be avoided. So I am really uninterested in dating in general, on any level.

I feel incredibly needy, and extremely anxious about balancing time and money once the baby arrives. I think it would be extremely difficult for me to tolerate my husband going on dates and leaving me with the baby. Now that I've lost all interest in dating other people, I feel brewing resentment at the prospect of him doing it.

We don't have any other serious partners right now. Although as I write that, I am realizing it's largely because this has happened to everyone else -- the other people we've dated seem to have mostly drifted into monogamy as we moved out of our 20s.

I know my husband sees being poly as an essential part of his identity. I feel like I don't have a leg to stand on, changing the rules this late in the game. I am losing sleep over the fear I feel about how this argument is going to play out. I think (in fact am about as sure as I can be) that he would rather be divorced than be monogamous.

So I am wondering if anyone out there has been through a similar experience. Putting the toothpaste back in the tube.

In the context of a poly relationship with primary partners (live together, have kids, married, etc.), to what degree do you give up authority to make your own decisions with regards to other relationships?  
Recently I had a conversation with my primary partner where I asked her if it was ok if I made weekend trip plans with my secondary partner (a new milestone).  Her response was a fairly vigorous statement that I didn’t need to ask permission, just to make sure we didn’t have anything else scheduled that weekend and outside of that it was really more appropriate for me to let her know that I was making plans rather than asking if it was ok - and incidentally she was happy for us.  Her response wasn’t too surprising given our relationship, but it got me to thinking about the level of freedom that people give up in poly relationships compared to the standard monogamous ones.  
For the purpose of this discussion let’s talk about considerations that are not directly within the primary relationship.  Obviously if you need to coordinate who is watching the kids, or if you can afford that plane ticket these are part of your relationship with your primary.  Outside of that though things get a little more gray because decisions I make about my secondary don’t happen in a vacuum – they do effect my primary (as the example of me being out of town for the weekend).  Having some level of veto over who your partner sees (and what they do) seems relatively common, though not universal.  There seem to often be a lot of rules about what, when, and how secondary relationships can develop intended to give the not-present partner some level of control over things, though my intuition is that is usually more an illusion of control than anything else.
So I guess what I’m looking for is an idea of what works and what doesn’t work for people.  Do you feel it’s appropriate to grant/deny your partner permission, or more have a model of communicating what you’re feeling and letting them know what you want?  Seems like it is more than just a matter of the wording – there’s a concept of what you’re entitled to in your partnership.

* I'll try not to leave any major spoilers! In one episode, a character named Stahma is talking with Mayor Amanda Rosewater. They are speaking of a woman named Kenya, owns and works at a bar/brothel/gambling house. Stahma says her husband Datak is ""insatiable"" and sometimes makes use of Kenya's establishment. Stahma goes on to say that some of the other ""night-porters"" who have been with Datak don't look Stahma in the eye, nervous because they are sleeping with her husband, and they know she knows it. But Kenya will go up to Stahma and say ""Your husband is so wonderful. Thank you so much for agreeing to share him."" Stahma tells Amanda that she really likes Kenya for this reason, and wants to help Amanda and Kenya with the major conflict going on in that episode.

* In the next episode, an ambassador from another territory arrives, with her two husbands. Later, Amanda is talking with the main protagonist, Nolan, about group marriage. Nolan dismisses it, stating he finds relationships with one other person hard enough, he can't imagine more than one, or something to that effect. Whereas Amanda says she HAS considered the benefits of group marriage. She says that everyone has different sides to them, and if she were to have multiple partners, she could be all of those sides (or something similar, I don't have an exact transcript). She also doesn't believe in ""true love with only one person."" Nolan again dismisses all of this, saying he just thinks Amanda has been in love before and got burned. (Hopefully he changes his tune if the topic is ever approached again.)

Regardless, after Amanda mentioning the whole ""different sides"" thing, I was definitely smiling, because my partners and I have brought up this exact benefit to our relationship! My boyfriend also looked over to me and smiled at this scene, it was a nice moment. :)

1364735042.0,36,self.polyamory,1bctpl,"I'm a 25F-Pansexual and I need help coming to terms with my 31M-Straight husband's OPP. (This is long, sorry.)",41,5,151,http://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1bctpl/im_a_25fpansexual_and_i_need_help_coming_to_terms/,"**OPP: One Penis Policy.** When Partner A says Partner B can only be involved with people with out penises. 

We've been married for 5 and a half years now, and we've both been actively ""putting ourselves out there"" for about half a year. We've always been poly but we are so shy it took us a while to make the effort. Also, newly wed bliss.  

Ideally, we both want a completely balanced triad, but we both realise that's hard to find and are just trying to make our own separate connections for now.  

Now here is my source of angst. Husband is completely straight, and I'm pansexual. We've spoken at length about what we are comfortable with the other person doing ""on the side"" and my limits are thus:

* No illegal shit.
* I need to know where you are going, and the full name of the person you are meeting if it's a first date.
* If you fuck on anything fabric in my house, wash it.
* They need to know my ground rules.  

My only other ""request"" is that she and I have a way of contacting each other in case of an emergency involving my husband. Like, if he is suddenly hospitalised, I want to let her know.  

Now, my husband has the same rules, but he's also added:  

* Wife can not date/fuck/play (kink-scene stuff) with anyone that has a penis, ever had a penis, or will have a penis.  

This includes dating people that are trans, or even attending a [CFNM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clothed_female,_naked_male) dinner party that was **strictly** no play. It was literally a fancy dinner party with ladies, where the ""waiters"" were naked partners of the female guests.  

Now, I know that people's feelings don't need to be quantified, that he feels the way he feels and he doesn't need to justify that to me. He doesn't need to change that for me. I would also never do anything to break his rules, just as I trust that he would never break mine.  

I'm just struggling to come to terms with his OPP. We've spoken about it a few times, and we have friends that think it's ""stupid"" and ""unfair to [me]"" and I feel the same way. But I have to stand up for him and say ""It will hurt him if I do, so I wont. Even if a disagree.""  

I'm pansexual to my core. I think humans are all just meat-suits with someone amazing inside. I don't care what they have between their legs or what their chromosomes say but he just can't look past it, and is absolutely not willing to try too. But I've had a horrible history with women. I've been hit, emotionally and verbally abused, thousands of dollars stolen from me, got kicked from my apartment, my cat stolen, lied too. Had girls that were making the first move suddenly ""stop"" being bi/gay and suddenly hate me. My mother is horrible to me, my grandmothers were both mentally unstable, my aunts are terrible human-beings, I have ZERO female friends. I've been abused by a string of female co-workers/managers. I trust women to hurt me, in any way they want because I will never matter to them as much as they matter to themselves.  

I realise that last paragraph is my own shit but the confusion and failure to comprehend ""half the population is off-limits to you because I'm not okay with extruding genitalia"" while I'm afraid of women. I trust men, men are nice to me. I can't reconcile this. It's making me resent him and my bringing it up to try and talk through it deeply upsets him. He doesn't understand why it's an issue for me. ""You're beautiful, you could get any girl you want."" But that's bull shit. I don't want to only  be with men, I would love a girlfriend. And I'm trying to meet women. A woman.  

And this has been an issue. The ONE girl liked me back turned out to be a trans-woman. So naturally I had to tell the husband. ""Oh well, you can still be friends with her!"" Well, so much for that. (In the end she turned out to be incredibly unstable and violent, so that was a bullet dodged.)  

Sorry this got so long. I'm just deeply conflicted. I need people to talk to about this. In the end, I know I need to accept his limit. I'm working on it.  

**TLDR:** Husband says I ""can't date/fuck/play with anyone that has a penis, ever had a penis, or will have a penis. "" As a pansexual with a history of being treated like scum by other women, I feel confused, conflicted and resentful of his ""illogical""  and ""incomprehensible"" limitation. But I know I need to accept it, respect it and move on. I just need to talk this through with other poly's.

I'm fairly young (25F) with multiple male partners--some more committed than others (living with one, still in the beginning stages with another, for example). I'm not a big fan of the primary/secondary labels, personally. I like to feel like a relationship has the opportunity to develop wherever it's going to go, without any artificial restrictions.

With that in mind, I've been thinking a lot about what my future could look like. If I have multiple, ongoing relationships, how might it play out when I'm ready to have kids, for example? I love the idea of raising kids with more than one partner. All of the examples of this that I've read about, though, have been in the context of triads or quads, which is very different from what I have. My partners are friends, but not romantically linked.

There's this part of me that feels like the likelihood of dating men that would want to become a family unit with me and my other partners (and their partners, of course!) is very low, and I find this thought discouraging, like I'm going to have to ""choose"" when I'm ready to have kids. This is all way off in the future, of course, but I guess I'm just looking for stories in the meantime. How have your poly situations played out in the long term? Has anyone raised kids in a multiple-parent household (and what is your situation like)?

During that time, we've met quite a few poly folks. One of the surprising thing I've came to realize meeting poly people is that my idea of love isn't shared by everyone. I feel like, especially among people not in a committed relationship, being poly often means that relationships, by definition, are transient, and there is no such thing as lifetime commitment. This reasoning in turn make people break up when things get tough, when the NRE fades, giving up on a relationship that had a lot of potential. Because I don't agree with any of this, I'm going to share the story of how my wife and I met. It's unconventional, some may say crazy, but to this day, it's the best thing that happened in my life.

When we met, 10 years ago, we were not at the best place in our life. Not happy with our lives in general. we had no sexual passion, because of my insecurities/lack of experience (sex scared me), and because she wasn't happy with her body at the time, and thought sex wasn't that important. What we had however, was that feeling that we could just spend every minute of every day with each other, being ourselves, and be happier than alone.

In the following 10 years, we both changed, a lot. I became more secure, more sexually open. She became more confident, worked on her body. We had good moments, and bad moments. Almost divorced once, and lived separated for a few months. I never gave up though, despite my friends' advises. Everybody thought I was stupid, pussy whipped, too afraid to be alone. I doubted, but hold on to the relationship.

Fast forward to the beginning of 2012, something happened. I had always been a very logic, science oriented kind of person, with no spirituality, and I would have laughed at anybody who would have tried to describe the event that happened to us then. It did happen to me however, I couldn't deny it, so there it is.

Some people call it peak experience, Buddhists I think would call it enlightment. It's a very temporary state in any case. For us, it lasted 3 days. It was brought on by an out of the ordinary chain of events, which made the both of us very emotional, I don't honestly know the exact causes. What I do know however, is that, finally, I understood what love was. We talked and talked, and then we had no more secret for each other, no more fear, no more doubt. We both pretty much cried for 3 days. I felt full of love, compassion, and understanding, for her, but also for the whole world.  I felt like I could have walked on water. There were no drug involved, yet when we touched each other, it felt as if we had taken the best ecstasy in the world.

It rocked my world. I didn't know what love was before then. I had no idea something like this could happen so far into a relationship, but it did. Love is a powerful thing, way more powerful than I had imagined, but it takes time, it takes effort, so if you feel like you have something special, don't give up.",,False,self,t5_2qu5n,False,,,True,t3_15pifq,http://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/15pifq/something_about_love/,

I've been holding off meeting her as I'm worried I'm too intense a person and would scare her off, and also I am always terrified I won't approve (he's not dated many other girls, so I'm sure that will get better with time). 

A few days ago we hung out in a group of 5, and played a couple of board games together. She was really sweet and friendly and pretty (always helps, let's not kid ourselves ;D), and they were sitting next to each other holding hands and it just made me want to squee and hug them. ***AND*** I didn't make a fool of myself, to boot!

I'm a bit jealous, a bit envious, and a bit happy ... All rolled into one.  My wife is out on her first overnight date with her girlfriend.  The beaming in her eyes as she was getting ready was... Unforgettable.  It's the reason I was ok with her suggestion of opening our relationship up to poly.

Of course, it's hard for numerous reasons.  The girl she is dating is a female version of me.  So many shared interests, points of view, communication styles, etc... As my wife put it, we'd hit it off amazingly well if she didn't have a ""one penis policy"" from her other.  It doesn't help that I've not had much luck when looking, but my wife is regularly attracting those that she isn't into but I find interesting.

So that's envy...

Jealousy, since we've been together, we have never spent the night apart except for work trips.  Neither of us sleep well when we are apart.  I know that for this weekend, not only is she going to be out with someone else, I will be tired as hell and an emotional mess since I will not be able to sleep a wink until she gets home.  Having to split her time is rough.

And of course, happy as well.  A bit of a back story... Due to some issues with our house, our family stayed with another family for a little over a month last year.  While the other husband was away on business, the two wives were AMAZING.  They were both phenomenal to have around.  Parenting was split 3 ways, running the household was split up well, everyone was happy and leaned on each other for support and got more than they needed.  While nothing sexual happened, we were all able to connect with ease.  I still remember cuddling up on the couch to watch a movie while the kids from both families played well together.  The look on my wife's eyes every single day was one that I would do anything to have again.  And having our friend that we were able to bond so well with?  Awesome.  We were all talking about how it would be so nice to live like that for good... Until the other husband got back from travel.  He was happy to help us out, but was very jealous of the time my wife and his wife spent together.  He's a bit of a control freak and didn't care to have anyone else make decisions.  (Of course, he has been actively suggesting he should be allowed to find another wife, ala ""sister wives"", but she's not allowed to even look at another person without threat of physical violence.).  They had to move because of work, but my wife and I still talk about if had worked out...

About a month ago, I started hanging out with this girl who was in a relationship with another woman. Soon I was hanging out with both on a regular basis, and just recently, the three of us started becoming intimate.

Both of them consider themselves to be bisexual; in fact, this was both of their first serious two-lady relationship. They had been dating for about a year before they met me, and they live together.

I'm starting to grow feelings for them, and I think they are also growing feelings for me. The problem that seems to have arisen is that one of the girls is much more sexually driven than the other. I also have a very large sexual appetite. So there seems to be a trend happening where I'm having much more sex with one than the other. The problem is, that I think the other is feeling perhaps left out or neglected, or perhaps even jealous/competitive toward me; I think she feels like I'm trying to steal her love away, which I'm really not. To avoid possible hurt feelings, my main mate feels uncomfortable engaging in sexual activity if the other isn't present; I respect this decision, and I really don't want to hurt anyone.

How should we discuss the matter of varying sexual appetites and address the fact that two of us are more sexually hungry than the other. Can this fling overcome jealousy and become a relationship?

Of course, I asked him why, and he said he just assumed that I was seeking other partners in order to eventually phase out my current partner with a new one. I was surprised - I'd made it very clear in my profile that I was committed to my SO, and trying to impinge on that was a bad idea. Turns out, this fellow couldn't picture having an open relationship for any other reason. I asked why he was comfortable becoming friends with someone who was doing something that scummy, and he said he could actually really empathise with that course of action, as a person who is chronically afraid of being single.

I've considered myself Polyamorous for over a year but I've only been actively involved in a non-monogamous relationship since December. I'm currently in a triad with two beautiful women, one cisgendered and one transgendered. We're all happy and very much in love with one another. I'm a very out activist on campus, and as part of that I decided to come out to my parents around two months ago, the idea being that through a news paper article or any number of other sources they'd eventually find out anyway. They reacted very well at the time, met both of my partners and seemed to be having a pretty easy time of things.

Flash forward to now. My mother has gone from ""totally fine"" to totally incapable of handling the situation. The last time I'd seen them they were asking questions about Trans* issues and my girlfriend wanted me to let them know that they could talk to her about things if they wanted. I went to visit my parents for Mother's Day and during the course of a conversation I mentioned this to my mom while my dad wasn't home and she flipped out. In addition to totally invalidating my girlfriend's gender identity she covered every worst thing someone could possibly say to someone coming out in the course of an hour. 
The highlights: ""it's just a fad"", ""we had a word for that in my day, it's slut"", ""this isn't about you, can't you think about what this is doing to us (her and my dad)?"", ""well how will you deal with this when you're married?""
With bonus material: ""[partner's name] is just gay and that makes you gay to and you're both gay together and that's horrible for me"" (paraphrased) and ""every time your father and I have ever said we accepted something about you we were lying so you wouldn't stop talking to us"". And that's not even getting into all the gender stuff.

Yeah. Holy shit. So here's where it gets tricky. I can't just never speak to my parents again, and I don't actually know if my dad feels at all similar or if she just threw that in there. I'm in college, I'm financially dependent on parent-plus loans, and my summer job is through my parents at a business they run. Also I'd ideally LIKE to speak to my parents again, just not while they feel this way about things. I have to go back there within the next few days for work, but I don't feel like I can see them comfortably, and I don't know how to ask my dad if he feels the same way about things.

I used to be in a poly relationship where things were supposed to be completely even, no primaries or secondaries, just love and it kinda went lop sided when I utterly fell for one of them (my current primary).

Everyone is clear about the status of their relationship with me and none of the secondaries expect more than I'm willing to give, but christ, why does it still seems to eat me up?

First off, thanks for the responses for the above post, they were very insightful and helpful. You are absolutely right that opening the relationship should never be a solution to a problem, and now I have that wisdom and will definitely take that into account if this ever comes up.

So today my boyfriend and I were discussing new sexual things we'd like to try at some point. After briefly discussing buttplugs, he said, ""would you ever want to include another person?"" with a really blank look on his face. After a moment of hesitation I thought ""fuck it"" and explained to him how I felt- I felt that if there ever is a time where we have sexual urges toward other people, I would much rather deal with it in an honest and open way rather than possible cheating. I explained that when it comes to cheating, the dishonesty is what bothers me, not the actual sex. (FYI, cheating has never been an issue for us, but we're young and we want to be together forever so you never know.) He was actually really open minded to what I was saying and said that it is possible that he would consider some kind of threesome situation in the future if it seemed appropriate.

We discussed some details- decided it would probably go over better if we were involved with a woman rather than a man, and discussed what we would and wouldn't be comfortable with. Even though the discussion itself was easy, I have to say that I came away with it with a slightly uneasy feeling, which I think means that I wouldn't want to do it anytime soon and would need some more things discussed in great detail. However, I am simply thrilled- not necessarily because this threesome situation is more of a possiblity, but because we were able to have an open-minded and mostly comfortable conversation about it. I feel like it is a huge step forward in our relationship.

They were cutting it very close to the wire and hadn't even gotten up yet, so eventually I got irritated waiting for them so I went to their campsite to tell them to pack the hell up, and before I get close enough to say anything I hear unmistakable sex sounds and see the tent moving. *sigh* again, I turned away and waited for them to finish.

This is something we've talked about with him, and with each other, and which M has talked about with her other boyfriend to see if it was just a ""guy thing.""  So we're definitely communicating.  And B is always open to fixing things, but it never really lasts or stays at the forefront of his mind, he just goes right back to his aromantic baseline.  Maybe it's part of who he is.

Lately, M and I have a lot more time together because she moved for her job and now we live in the same apartment complex, and I think we've been sort of...supplementing the romantic side of things with each other (but to clarify, we're both straight).  Just in terms of paying each other unasked-for compliments, leaving random presents for each other ""because it made me think of you,"" etc.  

We also sort of make excuses/rationalizations for B in terms of him having a busy schedule or reassure each other that just because he's not demonstrative doesn't mean he doesn't care.  We remind each other to see certain things he DOES do as caring. Like, she'll remind me that if B is closed-off because he had a bad day, him being quiet is a caring act, because he doesn't want his venting to ruin my mood.  And I'll remind her that him not texting her last night was because he knew it was her date-night with J and he didn't want to interrupt.  We both remind each other that yes, affection still ""counts"" even if you have to ask for it, and not to hold B to any mind-reader standards.  I've also been known to send him a quick text every now and then to the effect of, ""M is having a bad day, maybe be extra cuddly with her tonight?""

This is fine, good, and supportive behavior.  I think.  But lately I've been worried that maybe we're both doing *too much* of B's ""job"" in terms of reassuring each other, explaining his behaviors, etc.  I start to wonder if we're being taken for granted, taken advantage of. 

I don't know if my relationship with B would have lasted as long as it has if it hadn't been for M, and I'm certain now that if things between the two of them went south, I probably wouldn't be able to continue with just him.

The currently critical and relevant truth on the table is that I'm polyfidelitous as a natural part of my orientation, but I managed to be virtually oblivious to this for a long time, not really putting two and two together in my head about things that *seriously should have made this obvious to me*. Ever since my high school dating environment, I've never really had fewer than three romantic partners at one time, and I've always kept my partners aware of each other's existence and their importance to me. At seventeen, I was successfully participating in nonsexual good-poly long term relationships. It's never been a *casual* thing for me; I've always gotten very close to the people I've dated, and been deeply devoted to them, and each time a relationship ended with a boyfriend, it was on mutually-friendly terms, usually relating to our lives just taking us farther away from each other. Things went swimmingly this way for years, and then I found my current partner, my fiance, during a time when all of my prior boyfriends had moved on in life to college or other things, and my closest relationship was the woman who is currently my secondary, but had not yet become romantic with me. 


My guy and I were amazing with each other from the start, and we knew that whatever we had, it was right and good and made us both incandescently happy. I had my best pal-not-yet-secondary, as well, and nobody else was attracting me, so I was totally content. Over the next couple years, we got engaged, and the relationship only grew stronger. My best pal and I started really recognizing our feelings for each other, which was startling for me, because I'd never had any attraction to another woman before, and it took some real emotional introspection to figure out where she and I stand with each other. 


Then trouble in paradise: this winter, I met a guy who had amazing chemistry with me right off the bat, and being around him felt -right- in the way that being around my partner felt -right- from the beginning. My first few attempts to discuss with my partner didn't get much of anywhere, mostly because I still hadn't actualized to myself that *yes,* polyamory *is* integral to my identity, orientation, and sense of Self. Once I figured that out, I explained it to my partner in a pretty long e-mail, so that he could mull it over. My partner's way of expressing love is very one-person-focused, and I personally just flat-out *don't experience jealousy at all.* He had to put a lot of effort into explaining it to me, because I didn't really understand that it's more a reactive emotion, less a conscious choice that a person makes about their attitude. For me, sharing people I love just seems like the most effortless thing in the world, and I had a hard time understanding how my partner didn't feel the exact same way.
 

The e-mail sat unanswered for awhile, and I started wondering if I was ever going to get any feedback from him about the issue, or if he was going to try to ignore the subject, hoping it would go away.


Finally, last night he leveled with me, and we pulled an all-nighter together, him asking me really in-depth and earnest questions about what I want, how I feel, and how I love. Perceived-infidelity was something which, at one time, he would have considered a deal-breaker... but he valued me and our relationship too much to treat giving up on it as any remotely entertainable option: we're each other's truest mate, and we've both felt secure in that certainty for years, so even something this serious can't and shouldn't be able to destabilize that certainty. He thanked me for having the courage to talk to him about it, because the last thing he wants is for our relationship to become one-sided silent suffering while one of us defers to the other on everything. It's one of the hardest things he's ever had to do, but this hyper-monogamous man with serious jealousy chose to transcend that jealousy so that he could take my needs and identity seriously and compassionately. 


We talked about my secondary and the new guy I'd recently started falling for. We talked about safety, health, and communication. We talked about logistics and even about moving later in the year so that we can be closer geographically to my secondary. On his own power and cleverness, he thought up ways that my spending time with my paramours could be a boon to our relationship, like how it would allow him more time for solitude and recovery from social fatigue (he's very introverted and needs a couple nights a week to himself normally) without me having to feel lonely or shut out from affection. 


Every question he asked was important and respectfully given, and the answers compassionately and patiently received. Every suggestion and idea he offered came from a place of love and understanding, and he treated the situation not as ""just in case this happens,"" but as ""this will happen for certain, so let's talk about it, so we're on the same page."" Every step of the way, he supported my voice and my free agency, and he phrased things so that I could empathize with what he felt, as well. He earnestly gave me his blessing to pursue more contact and depth in my currently long-distance relationships with my paramours, and he even sympathized with me about the longing and discomfort of having them at long-distance like this, expressing a wish that they would be accessible to me sooner than later. 


Two weeks ago, I didn't dare hope for anything remotely close to what occurred last night, and my partner has absolutely blown me out of the water with his devotion, his consideration, and the selfless depth of his love for me. Today we snuggled and spent quality time together, after I'd been away with relatives over the weekend, and our reunion was as sweet and intense as the first times we came together after a time when our own relationship had been long-distance.  I don't know what I could ever have done to have deserved this wonderful man as my primary and my future husband, but he is infinitely precious to me, and I'm so damn grateful to have him, and so damn in love with him.

I am still feeling like I am poly despite all that has happened but it turned out really badly for me. So...I'm gunshy

My husband and I first became poly in 1999 when I fell in love with my best female friend. We ended up in a relationship with her and her husband that lasted approximately 4 years. It all blew up when my girlfriend decided that she could no longer deal with my now ex-husband because of various  personality clashes between the two of them. I was caught in the middle because I loved all 3 of them: the gf, her husband, and my then-husband.  It turned out to be a deal breaker because my ex husband was primary to me and even though I never stopped loving that other couple, it was becoming a big issue between he and I, so I ended things with them. 

A while later, he met a woman online. They began a relationship.  From the beginning he was so supportive of my discovery of being bisexual that I always wanted to support whatever he needed to explore for himself as well. I loved him so much...I just wanted him to be happy. I was truly willing and able to give him the time and space to be with others because I wanted him to feel happy and fulfilled as a person. I know that must sound like bullshit but it was absolutely true, that is how I am.

So, long story short, this woman and her six year old son ended up moving in with us. She had two babies fathered by my husband with my enthusiastic consent and participation. One passed away 24 hours after she was born due to catastrophic and unfixable birth defects. The second daughter, born one year later, survived and thrived.

I raised her, she was mine. I loved her every bit as much as I loved my own daughter.  In fact, my ex and his paramour were in grad school for 2 years so I did most of her caregiving while they were at class or off studying and doing homework at a coffee shop. I wasn't doing it to be subservient, I truly love that child and consider her my daughter still. 

I really had plans to raise her to adulthood along with my stepson and my daughter. It didn't turn out that way.

Apparently my husband's other wife and my husband himself had other plans and wishes. None was communicated to me. One week before our 18 year old daughter's wedding, my husband announced to me while I was home for lunch from work, ""I think we should divorce."" He would never give me a reason. Wouldn't consent to counseling. Wouldn't discuss it. He wanted me out of the home ASAP and filed for divorce very quickly. Now he and the other woman are planning a lavish wedding. I have to beg for time with the two younger kids (my daughter is grown and married so she chooses when to contact me).  I truly don't know wtf happened.  I am leery of ANY and all relationships now. I KNOW myself: I could never commit to monogamy. But how can I ever trust a poly relationship again after this?

   In my mind, I was ready for her to date another guy and take the relationship as far as she/they wanted (as long as we remained primaries together anyway, she can have her secondary fun). Silly me, I had thought that getting over, what is to me, ""The Sex Thing"", would be the hardest part. Now the surprises happen that I had no clue were coming.
   Texting for one. I had imagined her out once a week, I neglected to imagine that they would stay in nearly constant contact via texting, facebook, and emails.
   Recovery time for another. Going out with another person on very limited time means she gets in at between one and four in the morning and she has to rise at six. Now instead of having her away just once a week, it's really twice as she has to sleep very early the next day and I need to be extra helpful with taking care of the toddler and other housetasks.

  So my question is: what things completely suprised you when you thought you were ready? I'd like to see at least one thing coming at some point :)

Anyway, my boyfriend and I have been dating for six years, since we were teenagers, and just this summer started talking about polyamory. He coyly brought up the idea a long time ago and at first I was a little befuddled by the idea and had a negative reaction where I thought I must be not enough for him and other absurd conclusions. I voiced all those thoughts to him and he was very comforting and assured me it had nothing to do with me and it was something he was interested in but would never want to engage in it if I wasn't completely comfortable.

This brings me to why I wanted to share here. I kept the idea in the back of my mind and would mull over it sometimes and began thinking of it as a possibility and something I could see myself enjoying. I found this subreddit and began to read all these success stories and see how positive being polyamoruos has affected people. Also, over the past few years I've been realizing I've had a growing attraction towards females, but, being in a committed relationship I never really thought it would be something I would be exploring. With all that in mind I picked up a copy of Ethical Slut and really enjoyed it!

I brought all this up to my boyfriend and it was really amazing. Talking about polyamory brought us to a new level of communication. We decided to put all vulnerabilities on the table and talk about what we'd like about it, what would make us uncomfortable and then we explored why they would make us uncomfortable. We would talk for hours and share feelings we'd never shared before. I've been a pretty closed off person emotional my whole life so being so open felt personally freeing.

We started our journey slowly and dipped our toes into the water and a few times at small gatherings with close friends decided to allow one another to kiss others. Recently, we talked to a close friend that we both adored and found very attractive then brought up the idea of fooling around together; when we expected to be confronted with awkwardness the girl we approached instead sounded excited and very willing. My SO and I talked a lot about what would be okay and what wouldn't and remained very mindful of one another's feelings all the days leading up to our night together. We ended up having a wonderful night! The friend who came over was very friendly, excited and also was mindful of everyone's feelings through out the evening. It was great getting to experience all the energy of one another and just enjoy each other. I was a little scared about the dynamics leading up the the event; I was concerned about one of us feeling left out but it worked out really well and I believe we all did a splendid job of including one another.

It's so great getting to grow and experience a new chapters of my life with my boyfriend. Our communication has grown so much because of this decision we made together and it feels so wonderful being so open. It's made me feel really confident of our future together and excited about what's to come next. It's also helped me gain confidence in myself and prevented me from getting angry or jealous because of my SO's interactions with other girls. I think my problem before was that I assumed it meant there was something wrong with me, but this whole journey has taught me that his appreciation for another doesn't devalue his appreciation and love for me. We haven't discussed much what our next step will be but I hope it will be as enjoyable as what we've experienced so far.

Sorry this is so long!

(from a mono perspective),33,1,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1564y7/i_feel_like_we_are_stuck_in_a_polymono/,"Currently I am in a relationship with a poly person. I respect him and who he is and love him very dearly. I am not really a poly person per say, like right now I am okay with it. But I know in the future I will want a mono relationship. We are extremely close, love each other beyond belief, and our relationship is stronger than a lot of relationships I’ve been in and have seen. We are both extremely open people, and accept each other for who we are. 

I really do love him and I don’t want to hurt him. I understand the way he is and accept it, though it did take me a while. I also have discovered I am not this way. Like right now since we are young, early 20s,to me it's more of a ""discovery"" stage. But I know I will want one relationship, I want to be able to give to him everything thing I can, and do for him all that I can, with the same coming back in return. I want someone who I can trust to always stand by my side, to always be there, and this is probably a insecurity on my behalf, but I don’t think that can happen in a poly relationship from what I understand about it. What do I do? 

We have been together a little over two years; it’s been a tough, but interesting, happy, wonderful, and very learning experience at the same time. I wouldn't trade it for the world. But lately I feel as if we will never be able to truly make each other happy, even though I know we are both happiest when we are together. I know for a fact, that although things are very good right now, we are both extremely open and are very good at communicating with each other; I will want a mono relationship in the future.  I want to grow old with one person, and I want that person to be my best friend, my lover, and my everything. Not because society told me I need one person, but because I have a difficult time trusting people not to hurt me. I can get myself to trust one person with everything, but getting beyond I know will be extremely tough or even impossible for me. I am a very emotionally strong person, but that is because I am careful who I trust with my emotions, how I handle them, and so on. 

I don’t want things to end between us, but I feel like we are trapped in this thing. We both love each other like crazy and would do pretty much anything for each other. I know the logical thing to do would be to be honest with him and with myself, but I am not ready for this relationship to be over.  I can’t let him give up a part of himself for me, the same that I can’t give that part of myself up. I would be unhappy then either way, because I would know deep down that he doesn't really want that type of relationship we have, and I would know that I am creating a barrier between him and the full and ultimate happiness he deserves. I don’t want to make him choose either. All I want is for him to be happy, to be exactly who he is, and never give that up for anyone, not even me. 

Also I don't mean to offend any body by my phrasing, I am not the best at semantics nor am I the best at fully thinking through things, but do make an effort to understand if I did and do apologize in advance. 

EDIT: 

I just wanted to say thank you to everyone who contributed. It helped me figure out a lot of things. The more I saw people responses the more I rejected the idea of ever ending our relationship because this difference we have. I will do everything I can to make it work, just like I would any other relationship. I love him, that is the most important part. With love you can do anything, and I think you should be willing to do almost anything. I know he will always be by my side if I ever need him. It will take a lot more work, but I am sure in the end it will work out.

I've been in a triad before, and been poly for a very long time (29m). Me and my primary (27f) communicate a ridiculous amount. She's also been poly for a very long time, so I have no worries there.

My biggest problem I guess is that our new girlfriend, though she fits us very, very well, isn't poly. Or at least, wasn't before she met us. She wasn't really anything. Her sexual history pretty much includes 12 guys, after not dating at all until she was 17 (she's 23). This is not only her first time ever being with a girl, but her first time doing anything like this. She seems to take to it like a duck to water, and fits with us like she's made for us, but I can't get myself to stop worrying over every little thing.

This weekend she's having her period for the first time since we became sexual (been dating her for about 3 months), so instead of spending her usual 4 nights a week over here, she's going to spend some time at home. Since we had a very busy Thanksgiving weekend, I thought it was a great idea, and had even thought of it myself that morning. I know that everything is fine, that there's no problems between us, yet I keep checking my phone like a maniac to see if she's messaged. I keep imagining scenarios where she's leaving us, or going back through the entire last month to see if there's anything I did wrong or could have done better.

There are absolutely no problems in our relationship. She has communicated every worry she's had, every time she's felt overwhelmed by anything at all, or any question she had (she didn't know the term Triad at first, and wanted to make things 'official' with us but didn't know how, it was adorable). There is no problem in time together, communication, or even other guys (the only other guys have been a poly friend of ours who when he realized we're in a closed triad backed off, and her ex who she never wants to be with again but is still friends with), yet my brain keeps going completely haywire about every single little thing expecting her to just up and leave us.

I've told her some of my worries, but not all. She has told me that she worries a lot too about a lot of the same things. She and my primary both reassure me that there's nothing wrong. Whenever I see her, she showers the both of us with affection and love. Even when I saw her last night, she was acting like everything was normal, completely affectionate and loving with the both of us, yet I kept getting distracted by trying to find some little *hint* of something going wrong, or something she might be hiding. I'm not sharing all of my anxieties with my girls as I realize that most of them are irrational, but at some point the dam is going to break and I'm going to have to do something about it.

My question is: How the hell do I calm down and realize that everything is okay? That things aren't going to blow up? That maybe I *do* deserve everything I'm getting, and that I'm not going to just fuck it up? I've been going through this same problem with my fiance for the past few years where I keep expecting the other shoe to drop, and it hasn't. I suppose that I've just gone through so many failed relationships that I keep expecting this one to end no matter how wonderful it is, but it just isn't. It just keeps getting better, and that's freaking me out.

Even when things do end, it's for a good reason &amp; life is better for each (ex)partner as a result. 

I was having jealousy issues with my primary earlier this year, as his secondary relationship was taking off and I hadn't had a partner in a few years. I had been on a few dates, but never actually clicked with anyone. I finally started getting my jealousy identified and dealt with, then met an amazing woman (almost like a karmic reward) that I've fallen completely in love with. Now that I'm more in tune with my own emotions and my primary, I'm able to let go of the petty stuff and enjoy my own relationships and activities and goals. Certainly, my therapist and my partners have a lot to do with that, but the poly specific questions that I had - the practical stuff - were answered by the greater poly community.  And just knowing that there were other people who'd had similar issues and are still happy, healthy adults years on, was a big help to make me feel like less of a freak and more of an individual.

Thank you, folks, the advice and support you all give is invaluable.

I wanted to report back to these lovely boards that things have gotten much better.  First things got much worse, then I found out that I was pregnant.  After trying unsuccessfully for more than 2 years to get knocked up, it happens during the most turbulent time our relationship has ever seen.  I was quite afraid for a while that my marriage might be dissolving and had even starting making vague plans on moving my life forward and having a baby without my marriage.  I was so worried about his depression and behavior changes that I started to feel like this was the only way.  It was breaking my heart.  If I had truly believed that closing the relationship would have solved our problems, I would have, no question.  However, I knew that closing wouldn't help and might only delay the end of the relationship if that's how things were going to be.  

I am happy to report that they are much much better.  He reached a turning point and his depression is abating.  We still have a lot of work to do to get ourselves healthy and secure for our soon-to-be-family, but I no longer think that the end is nigh and I look to the future with happiness.  He is excited about the baby, though not quite as much as I am.  He is seeing someone he likes on a regular basis and is seeking new dates.  I am still seeing my boyfriend, who is nothing but happy for me in regards to the pregnancy, as is his wife.  Things have even gotten more serious between us in that, finally, after months of dating and lots of long stares without saying anything, we finally said the words ""I love you"".  A good friend of mine pointed out, ""Aw, you are truly polyamorous!"" 

I just wanted to post a follow-up to prove that things can improve, even when they seem insurmountable and part of you wonders if becoming poly was ever a good idea to begin with.  There's a lot of negativity on these boards sometimes, but right now, my happy-poly feelings are a little overwhelming.  I'm finally pregnant.  I have a husband that I love and will continue to love in the context of our marriage and a boyfriend that I love and can trust to be there for me in the future as as well.  Even though he has a kid and he knew that I was trying to get pregnant with my husband, I still find it incredibly touching and super poly-awesome that he's seemingly unfazed by it and truly excited for me.  I occasionally wonder
""What is this strange happy world I have wandered into and how did I get here?""  

I've been on [r/babybumps](http://reddit.com/r/babybumps) a lot, but I don't really talk about the poly stuff there, so I had to get this out. :D

TL;DR: After my husband wanted to close, the relationship got really rough and I thought it might end.  Then I got pregnant and things got worse.  Now they are much better and I'm fully of happy-poly-happy-pregnancy feelings and I'm so glad we stuck with the decision to become poly to begin with.  Also, I love my boyfriend and he loves me!

I'm not poly, and I'm still very new to the idea, but I've been reading a lot about it the last few days, and I have a question I'd like some perspectives on.

For a little background, I wouldn't consider myself strictly monogamous, I've just never considered the idea of polyamory. I've recently been in a relationship with a polyamorous person, and (somewhat due to my own misunderstandings of the lifestyle) had my heart broken by a betrayal of trust when she organized to meet partners behind my back and lied to me about her actions.

I know that trust is a huge part of the lifestyle, especially with a ""primary"" in one's life. And now that we're considering giving this relationship an honest try, I'm understandably quite nervous. However, I don't want to say, ""Sure, we can try a relationship, but due to your lifestyle choices, I want to impose a bunch of restrictions, like monogamy.""

Personally, I feel I'm within my right to ask for an exclusive relationship. The problem I'm having is that I don't feel right asking someone who is very openly polyamorous and flirtatious to hide who she really is just because it makes me uncomfortable.

For you polyamorous people, have you ever been asked to commit to a primary? How did that make you feel? If you love someone enough, do you think that you could ""abstain"" from other partners and focus on building a healthy relationship? And would it be offensive of someone who really loves you to ask you to do so?

EDIT: Holy crap! Thank you to all who have responded so far, your insight is invaluable to my cause, and I appreciate the time you've taken to help.

I'm not sure if I'm 100% comfortable with polyamory in a relationship for now -- mostly due to my own self-esteem issues. I think I just need to have a monogamous commitment for a while, to sort of ""prove to myself"" that I'm worth committing to, and that I'm capable of keeping someone satisfied. I will work very hard at understanding the polyamorous perspective, and even though I think I'll never fully understand it, it won't cause me to see the woman I love any differently.

This is just very rough for me. I appreciate all your kind words, and even the not-so-kind ones. I came here completely clueless on how to proceed, and now I'm slowly becoming optimistic about the situation.

I posted a while back [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/wjuur/chronic_illness_and_polyamory_would_like_to_hear/) about trying polyamory. Over the past few months, my awesome SO and I have made a lot of progress. We are making OkCupid accounts this weekend. We feel ready now, but  I'm kind of intimidated by the idea of dating again. I find pursuing people super fun and exciting, but also emotionally draining. I've never used online dating and I'm really nervous about making a terrible faux pas (it's the internet, and I realize this is silly but still). I don't think it helped that the first person it recommended was literally this guy down the street from me who I see awkwardly around campus all the time. I guess I find reddit and other forum/ social media verbal communicating avenues to be very insulating and realizing oh crap these are people THAT I KNOW IN 3D was kind of a jolt to me.

So basically, What's r/poly's experiences with sites like OkCupid? Any tips or tricks in order to make this adjustment easier? I'm so crap at dating. I have no idea what I'm doing here. 

But other than that, thanks for being such awesome people. Reading your posts and hearing your responses to my questions has really helped this process and I'm SO happy to be where I am in my relationship. Thanks everyone!

**Edit/ Update: Thanks for the advice everyone! It seems like the strategy of choosing a tasteful profile picture and having the I'M IN AN OPEN RELATIONSHIP very visible has been the most advised strategy for weathering OkCupid.

It must be said that what her husband did and said is indefensible, and I 100% agree that she should protect herself and take the first step in their divorce as suggested.  But I have a real problem with that characterization for a number of reasons:

* It can generally be presumed that few if any of us have met this man, and therefore we have only the OP's account upon which to judge him.  That's a very incomplete picture.
* Any member of this community could be similarly dragged through the mud, should one of our SOs decide that they don't like us as we are.
* Personally, I came to this sub looking for a non-judgmental community.  That includes not making undue judgments of people who've hurt others.  I know there's a reflex to lash out, but I think we do better if we try to be fair.

My mom, who lives 800 miles away, came to visit me and stay in my house for a week.  

She arrived in the afternoon, having driven.  I was fresh off a date with a fairly new relationship, so bubbly and happy in general when she arrived.  I made her a cup of tea and at an opportune time flashed her my new tattoo.  Which she took in stride for about 5 minutes and then want to know why I would do such a thing.  I told her about my impending birthday and other plans I have for it (a big zero year).  She made some comments about what she did when she was my age, changes she had made, we talked about her relationships to my dad at that point and time and I made some comments about how I perceived it.

She shook her head and sighed and made a comment about the things we do to our children...and I said ""speaking of which...""

She rolled with it.  She immediately asked about my husband (don't worry about him--he has three girlfriends!)

I don't think the coming out had too much of an effect on the visit in general; she was going to drive me crazy anyway.  But I didn't have to sneak around in order to see my boyfriend, who I see every day.

She had met him before, he came over for dinner that night, I would say it was a successful coming out.  She asked me to not tell my sister, which I have no intention of ever doing anyway.

I spun the whole thing as happy and positive, very loving and good for the kids--all of which I believe.

So thanks for the good advice, good wishes and positive energy you may have sent my way.  it worked!

So, over the next few days, we are having The Talk. The ""We like you, we are interested in being more than friends, will you date us?"" Talk.

I was dating a second guy for awhile and it was enjoyable enough, but just as that ended my (primary) boyfriend began pursuing a relationship with another chick. I'm hurt and I don't know what to do with myself. Yes, jealousy is a small part of the problem, but my biggest fear is that I'll never be as big of a part of his life again. 

Although we've been dating for a long time, we've very consistently been crazy about each other, usually spending time together every day and texting during all waking hours. He swore that he would pay just as much attention to me when we became poly, but things have changed. Now he texts her all day every day instead of me, even when I'm with him. I've told him that it hurts me, but I don't want to try to force him to pay attention to me if his heart isn't in it. Yes, we still see each other most days of the week, but instead of it feeling natural and expected it feels scheduled and obligatory. The part that worries me the most is actually that I miss out on little mundane parts of his life that I always knew before...I don't know why it matters, but it just shocks me every time I realize he's seen a movie and didn't tell me about it or went to a new restaurant without me and things of that nature. I've heard so much about new relationship energy and how it should energize the pre-existing relationship as well, but in addition to receiving less attention from him I also feel much less energy in our relationship than I did before. 

I know how whiny and insignificant this sounds, and I'm sorry, but I'm struggling with this and I need advice or similar stories or another perspective or something. I know he doesn't love me any less, but I'm used to being his center of attention, so even though he still loves me very much this feels like a step down from what we had in the past.

A lot of posts I've been seeing are searching for answers, or advice, and while those are great, and helpful to loads of people (Especially a newbie like me!) I wanted to share a warm and fuzzy moment I had this past week.

I'm not sure how others act in their poly families, but I like my circle close. I am involved in a triad with two wonderful ladies, and have three male lovers ""on the side"", each with their own differing appeals and interactions with me. (Read this as, not everyone is fucking at the moment) Our schedules are rather busy, so spending time together is wonderful, and I take as much as possible when I can. I'm so fortunate to have people in my life that are not jealous of other lovers, and even friendly with each other.

This week I got to have what I hope to be an often occurring treat. My girlfriend, lets call her C, came over and joined one of my lovers, B, for a snuggle on the sofa while watching an old movie. I got to flop in the middle of one hell of a sexy cuddle puddle! The highlight though, was when my left foot was rubbing against C's, and my right foot, against B's. C noticed, and called me out. ""Are you seriously playing double foots right now?"", to which I giggled and proudly declared that I was. Tickle fighting followed and died down, leaving three very happy, cuddled people.

I'm happy with just him, though he needs a little extra companionship, which I understand (having been in that position myself).  He tells me about relationships he's interested in pursuing, and 90% of the time, I say yes to them.  However, it rarely ever even gets that far because...he keep choosing the wrong kind of women.

He keeps falling for women who are single and monogamous, and then gets upset when they end up leaving him for a guy who will treat them like their one and only.

I tried to explain it to him like this:

Woman A likes cake.  You go to her and say ""Hey, I already have some cake at home, but I know you like cake and so how about we go out and split a cake together and each have some?""  She agrees because without you, she has no cake, and since *some* cake is better than *no* cake, she agrees, and is even happy with the half of the cake she gets with you.

Then, some guy comes along and says ""Hey, I heard you like cake, so here's a whole cake, just for you.""  Since she really loves cake, she's going to choose the guy who gives her a whole cake, rather than part of one.  She appreciates the piece that you had given her, but it left her unsatisfied, because really, she wanted a whole cake to herself.

The cake in this metaphor is, essentially, a relationship.  A non-primary member of a non-monogamous relationship is getting, at best, a part time relationship from you.  If they're naturally monogamous, they will settle for that in a pinch, but will always hope that someone will come along who will give them a full time, committed relationship.

In my eyes, thinking that someone who is monogamous will be happy as a tertiary member of another relationship is just naive.  I think he really should be looking for women who are themselves already part of a non-monogamous relationship. That way, they're already getting the bulk of their fulfillment elsewhere, and will be okay with being only a part-time partner, not to mention the fact that they will already be familiar with the dynamics of non-monogamy.

My SO seemed to sort of understand this explanation, but he still keeps making the same mistake over and over again.

Love this forum.  I really feel liberated knowing you guys exist.

Anyway.

I have some questions. I am about to have my two girls move in.  The three of us have not been together yet. I've been with them individually but not together.  

One is moving down from CA to be with us and will be here next week.

I really love them both and want to spend the rest of my life with them. They're BFFs already and skype and goof around online all the time.  

The one who is already here is like my BFF too and we spend 24/7 together and goof around all the time!

Anyway.  Here are my questions.

 1. What do you do in public about PDA and holding hands?  I am worried about being judged by people.  My sister and niece seem to be putting out a lot of 'negative karma' about the idea when I ran it past them.  I had a similar situation to this before and guys would stare at us and women would give HARSH looks.  It was a short relationship though so I wasn't able to figure anything out about solving this.

 2. What about sleeping?  I'm going to buy a King bed.  Do you just sleep in a big cuddle puddle?  Two beds?  King doesn't seem big enough.

 3. Do you tell other people? I think we want to tell people that one is my GF and the other is a BFF.  I think society still judges people too harshly.  Part of this is that I'm 35 and they are 20 so there are other stereotypes going against us. I should clarify that people guess my age at 25 as I have good genes and I'm in very good shape.  So as a couple/triple we do not look weird.

 4. How do you handle who gets to sit in the front seat lol... Force them to calls shotgun?

Also, no surprise in this subreddit, advice wanted.",42,11,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/vv8jq/coming_out_as_bisexual_and_polyamorous_the/,"I recently discovered I was bisexual and preferred poly relationships (my personal preference is MFF triads) late last year.  Since then I feel like a light has been turned on.  It's not that I was necessarily unhappy with straight, monogamous relationships... I just didn't feel fulfilled in someway.  I couldn't figure it out.  Now that I have I want to share what makes me happy with all my friends and family but am slowly discovering that this may not be the best idea.

Some people are totally cool about it.  I find that these are usually the people who have know other's who have been in poly relationships as well.  They understand that it's not something only Mormon's and Cult Leaders participate in (a comparison coming directly from a conversation I had with my mom - more on that in a minute).

Some of my favorite reactions include my little brother who responded with, ""yeah, that sounds about like something you'd do,"" and my good friend, ""yeah, a lot of people in this city (Portland) are into that.""  They then told me how happy they were for me and wished me luck.

The worst reaction came from my mom.  I only told her when she asked if I was ""seeing anyone at the moment"" (yes, mom, actually I am seeing some *people*) and brought it up as casually as I could.  I know it must have been a bit overwhelming for her to hear her daughter has a different sexual identity and that she chooses  a relationship structure outside of the norm, but her concerns have made me very realize a lot about the misconceptions of poly.

Concern #1: That I don't have enough self esteem to think that any one person would be interested in just me exclusively.

Concern #2: People who are involved in poly tend to be involved in other ""weird stuff"" (this is where the Mormon's and Cult leader's comparison came in.  Also, hippie communes).  She then proceeded to warn me about taking pictures and putting them up on the internet because ""people can find those and click and paste and it could hurt your ability to get a job, etc.""

Concern 3: This all comes from her and my dad getting a divorce when I was young and never choosing to date after they broke up.  Bisexuality and polyamory are not who I am but really just me wanting to be an close observer to a happy male female relationship so I can figure out how they work (implying that I really just want a ""normal"" hetro-mono relationship down the road).

It's incredibly frustrating.  I've responded to her concerns by saying: How can you think I have low self esteem when I have two wonderful people who care deeply about me and I can accept and embrace that?  Usually people with low self esteem have trouble thinking that one person can love them - I have two.  The second concern made me laugh more than the other two.  I really didn't know what to say other than ""no, mom, they are not in a cult, Mormons or hippies.  We don't take obscene photos and plaster them on the internet.  Please, think of my personal judgement calls on my privacy to be about the same as when I was just dating men one at a time.""  However, third concern made me feel bad.  She ended up saying ""maybe this is all my fault"" because she didn't date after my dad and her split up.  It made me realize how she really feels that this is something negative and she is blaming herself for what she feels is an unhealthy choice.  I don't know what I can say or do to make her see that I am the happiest I've ever been and having more than one love can be as healthy (or as unhealthy, luckily in my case it's the former) as any monogamous relationship.  

Do you all have any advice on what I can do/say to show her this?  Maybe it will just take time and reassurance for her to see there is nothing wrong (and something very right) about relationships like this for me.

Hi all. 
First I want to say this is an awesome community, although this is the first time I've posted here it was actually this place that introduced my wife and I to the idea of Poly over a year ago. 

I also apologise if this is long, complicated and slightly rambling, but these things are never simple are they! So, on to the details;



So the situation is this, my Wife (27, bi) and myself (m, 26, straight) became interested in Polyamory just over a year ago. It started as a fascination of my wife's after discovering this subreddit, she started reading lots of posts and articles and became deeply interested in it. After a while she started talking to me about it and I became similarly interested, doing the same, reading up on it as an interest never seriously considering it. After a few months she started making lots of playful jokes about how it would be great to have a ""second"" wife, usually when we were being playful or having intimate time together, I would play along but never took it seriously. As time went on though the conversations started to become serious, and by the summer of last year we were coming to the conclusion this was a lifestyle we wanted to try. However at the time we were expecting our baby, and were also preparing to emigrate at the end of the year. So, we made the decision that once we the baby was born and we were settled in our new home we would ""test the waters"" of poly so to speak. We started thinking about what would be acceptable and feasible etc, kind of planning it out in our heads.

Fast forward to January, we're settled here and we set up a profile on OKC and started trying to contact people. Now, my wife had her heart and mind set on a MFF triad, where as I was more open to just meeting people and seeing what happened (though would love a triad), however we initially started off ""unicorn hunting""... I'm sure I don't need to say this was fruitless. After a short while of no success we both agreed that we should start looking as individuals, so we setup profiles and started the delightful process of combing through OKC profiles :P both of us looking for girls (I should add initially I was only comfortable with the idea of her having a GF, but as time went on realised I was OK with her dating men too). We had no luck for a while.

In the meantime, we had our first ""experience"" of poly, which came about when a female friends of my wife's came to stay for the weekend. This is a girl she has extremely strong feelings for, as they have some history together but they hadn't seen each other for many years, though have always stayed in touch. We basically all hung around together all weekend, went out a few times, chilled drank and flirted which culminated at the end of the weekend in a threesome, which was awesome. We felt this was a great test of the waters, I felt a great sense of ""warmth"", compersion I guess, seeing my wife being intimate with this girl, and she described a similar feeling seeing me being flirty and having sex with this girl. We consider it a great experience, however due to her living almost 1000 miles away it is most likely a one off. However my wife is going to see her again this month. 

Back to the dating then, after about a month neither of us have had any real luck on OKC, but then I start chatting to a girl and quickly hit it off and arrange a date. My wife then decides she's fed up of not getting anywhere with girls on there and starts looking for men (and as an aside - holy shit girls get so much more contact from guys than guys do from girls, she was literally bombarded with messages within a day of changing her profiles ""looking for"", cracks me up!). She ends up chatting to a guy who is local and manages to arrange a date with him for a few days after I have arranged mine. I went on my date and it went better than I could have imagined, and to skip on details this girl and I have hit it off extremely quickly and have an extremely strong connection already, have had a second date and many more planned. Unfortunately my wife's date did not go well at all, there was no connection and she does not think she will see him again, which neither of us expected as he and her seemed to get on amazingly when texting and phoning. 

**So on to the issue;** Following from this, my wife has been in emotional tatters, she is feeling extremely jealous of the fact I had such a good date and have hit it off with this girl. She feels like she is being ""left behind"" in this and is fighting feelings of trying to be happy for me vs a feeling she is losing something by me developing feelings for this girl. She feels that right now I'm reaping all the benefits of this new relationship/lifestyle, and because she hasn't got anyone else right now she is having to deal with all the hard parts by herself and has no one she can talk to about it, as she doesn't feel I can empathise. As a result I am feeling awful as well, I feel so awful that my happiness is causing her so much pain. I don't think either of us expected things to move so fast, but they have. We are also running into little issues with each new ""experience"" as I guess is normal, for example, this girl came to our house as my wife wanted to meet her as soon as possible, and having never been in a situation like that before none of us knew what was appropriate for us all, and my wife came away feeling neglected as she didn't get enough reassurance and affection from me. We deal with each of these things as they come up, but its a painful conversation each time, necessary though. 



**So I guess I want to know about anyone else's similar experiences, how did you cope at the start? How hard was it when one partner was dating another wasn't? My wife has already expressed her main need is for me to constantly reassure her she is still wanted and I'm doing so. What else could you suggest?** 

Thanks! 

*(Oh and as I'm sure it will be mentioned, I have read The Ethical Slut, my wife has not, but I have convinced her to start as it helped me a lot.)*

The whole idea of polyamory is so strange and foreign to me I'd like to hear more about it. Normally I'd condemn somebody that said (s)he was in multiple relationships but this time I'll keep an open mind. I know it isn't for me since I am the jealous type and it would be hypocritical of me to pursue multiple women if my girlfriend can't. Things I'm wondering about is:

* Don't you get jealous?

* Do you expect your partners to have multiple relationships simultaneously as well? 

* Do you see yourself growing old with multiple partners or is this exclusively for your younger years?

I'm sure I can think of more later. I look forward to your responses!

EDIT: Good god, 42 comments! All of which have been very enlightening! The FAQ was a good read, but your individual responses doubly so. It seems to me many of you have different opinions on matters too, which is interesting, especially considering the fact that many of you don't expect your partner(s) to be polyamorous as well.

The true reason I asked you all about polyamory is because my best friend recently told/confessed to me he identified as such as well. He told me, without flinching, he was okay with his girlfriend 'connecting' and having sex with other men. This topic has helped me immensely in understanding him. Again, thank you all so much.

Help?,41,7,98,http://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/o3wev/lost_sexual_attraction_for_primary_help/,"Over the last year or so, I've lost all sexual attraction to my primary (spouse).  I find him attractive, and when we have sex, I still orgasm, however, I have no desire to have sex with him.  I avoid it even.  He and I have been together for 10 years.  To make matters worse, I have a secondary of 2 years who I love having sex with.  I want it as much as I can get it.  


My primary has started to notice.  He makes comments like, ""Yeah, I know, you're disgusted by me now,"" or ""I know you don't want me to touch you.""  He has also made comments like, ""Sorry I'm not ______ like _____"" (some attribute that my secondary has).  He says these things in a joking manner, but it's his way to let me know that he knows without coming out and saying it.  I try to deny it and pretty much force myself to have sex with him for the sake of our relationship.  We have children and he is a great father and husband so ending the relationship is not something I am willing to do at this point.


Has this happened to anyone else, and did the sexual attraction return?  I know it's common for sexual interest to fluctuate, but has anyone lost it completely to have it come back?  I also know that sex with someone new is always exciting, but I feel like 2 years isn't really new any longer.


Help.  I want my marriage to work.  I won't give up my secondary, so no suggestions of that please.  Also of importance, my spouse has a secondary too.



edit:  I wanted to thank everyone for their responses.  They have been extremely helpful.  I've come to the conclusion that this is most likely a reflection on how I feel about our relationship as a whole, not just the sex.  So, my plan of action is this:  1) Look in to an alternative birth control option.  This started around the time I started taking birth control pills, so it couldn't hurt to try something else to see if it helps; 2) Sit down with my husband and come clean about my lack of desire, while doing my best not to bruise his ego; 3) Stop denying there's deeper problems and actually commit to doing the work on our relationship and communicating better.  Get counseling if necessary.


Thanks again everyone.  Deep down I knew this is what it was, but it took you all to point it out to me to finally admit it.

I tend to get a bit crazy when I'm forced to stay in so I try to be out as often as possible to as many people as possible.

I am a polyamorous girl, in two long term relationships: one with my boyfriend who I live with; and one with a girl who lives a short drive away that I try to see as often as possible. She has a BF too and everyone involved knows about everyone else - we are very honest and open and it feels great. My problem comes in the fact that I recently started my LPC (legal practitioner's course - to be a lawyer) and have had to make new friends and try to fit in.

So far it's gone well, I have a new group of friends and I am happy. Yesterday I was wearing a jumper my GF bought me, they complemented and I said ""it was a gift"" and when they asked from who, I really couldnt be bothered to lie - they knew about my bf already, but I had never mentioned my GF before. Questions ensued and to my amazement their reaction was really positive (things like ""omg, that's so cool"" or ""I wish I had the time"") and even had a few come out as being bisexual themselves. Which made me feel thrilled just to be able to be me... so I told my mum what I did (my mum knows, does not approve, but knows of my lifestyle). 

She did not react well. She was talking like I have just ruined my career and will never be respected - things like ""it's one thing to do it, but then dont tell people! Especially not peers or people who you might work with."" Well, that brought me down. I've told so many people before, university friends and work mates in part time jobs, but she thinks law is different. She is a lawyer herself so I suppose it just got to me.

So my big problem is now, did I really make a huge mistake? I dont feel like I did but now I have it in my head that behind my back people will think I'm a monster and I will be shunned. I also know that UK anti-discrimination laws do not specifically cover polyamorous people, therefore it can be legally justified not to employ me based on my lifestyle.

I thought of her getting pregnant by my husband and it didn't bother me at all. In fact, it made me happy and excited... 

Now, the reason this thought led me to realize that I really do love her more than just the sexual attraction and fwb is because until her, the thought of any other woman having a child by my husband made me extremely uncomfortable and jealous. I know that my odds aren't good for having a child with my husband, thanks to my health (yay for the genetic jackpot hitting me more than any other cousin or even my brother) and I dream a lot of sharing that experience with him, so I couldn't stand the thoughts of someone else sharing that with him... until last night.

Any other poly ladies had this experience? Did you get all warm and fuzzy inside when you realized what had just hit you? What about the poly guys reading? Have you felt this regarding your female partner?

I would love to hear your stories about this... and since my brain is all kinds of baby crazy apparently, I'd love to hear stories of telling your partners about impending bundle(s) of joy. 

And also on a side note, I have to say thanks for making my previous post of bouncy bouncy joy joy hit the frontpage (by the time I got back on it was onto the second page of the frontpage, but that's still amazing for me.) and I'll be sure to let you guys know what our lovely unicorn lady says in her letter after the one we mailed out today telling her about the love r/poly has for her saying yes to us. :D

My SO and I have been poly for a few years now. We've seen relationships of different forms come and go, each unique in its form, flavour etc and we've thoroughly enjoyed each one and the lessons learnt. 

I'm starting to pick up on a trend though, and its a bit...upsetting. I guess by virtue of being a poly couple in a mono world, we are stereotyped very quickly as being a couple who's just looking for threesomes/NSA fun etc. While that is certainly fun, we are actually looking for more meaningful connections and always make that very clear right from the beginning. 

Nonetheless, we get treated like the couple we're stereotyped as. It really sucks to fall for people, have things be going well and then be tossed aside because the person is over their little experimenting-with-a-couple-phase and found a monogamous relationship to leave us for. Don't get me wrong, I've always been happy /for/ the other person - they find good relationships and seem happy. It just sucks being left so quickly and reminded that maybe where you thought things could go was never even an option for the other person. 

These experiences are starting to influence our latest relationship. I've been pretty hurt in the past and now find myself quite paranoid that this one will end in the same way, so even though a part of me is totally smitten, I'm not really allowing myself to fully experience, enjoy and share those feelings. I've built a wall guys! - for the first time in my life!

She has found a second who is one of our best friends. We both love this guy dearly (although to be clear I have no interest in a physical relationship with him) This weekend they were making out for the first time in the room next to me and I got hit by a major wave of jealousy. 

I made myself actually stop and think about what was going on in my head and how it didn't make any sense with our new lifestyle but I was still having issues with it. I know logically that they have done nothing wrong, but I was dealing with major insecurity. The next day my wife and I had a long talk about it and when she recounted how happy this new lifestyle was making her it flipped a major switch for me and reminded me why we are making this change.

It's not fair that my internal issues should intrude on their relationship especially since I love them both very much.

At first you were just a friend of a friend that would show up at our get-togethers.  Out on the fringes, but not in a bad way, just new to the group.

I'm sure I took note of you even then.  You were attractive, funny, and quick to smile.  As we crossed paths more often we chatted, flirted, and were openly friendly to each other.  At one time or another our brief foray in to the swinging scene came up.  We talked about how it turned out to not be at all what we expected and how we couldn't see ourselves with random strangers.

Maybe that is what first piqued your interest, I don't know and probably should have asked.  We mentioned that all of our encounters with friends were fraught with emotions we previously were not aware existed yet served to really solidify our relationship through honest and open communication.

Soem time after that you let it be known you were interested in us.  I can still clearly recall that first night.  My stomach was in knots all evening.  When I picked you all up after the concert there were sparks in the air.  Furtive glances and secret smiles.  There was just that pesky other person that had to leave us alone before we could play.

You feigned sleep until the coast was clear.  We lay in bed watching the clock.  When I heard you creeping down the hall, I bolted up and met you halfway.  There was no awkwardness, no ""naked with your socks on"" moments.  Everything seemed to flow and fit perfectly.  The first time we all made love it was a grunting, animalistic affair.  After some quiet talking and playful touching we went again in a slower, more sensual counter-part to our earlier frenzy.

I think we all approached that evening as a one-off, a tryst that needed to happen, for sexual sanity if nothing else.  For better or worse, we were all wrong.  Over the next several months we were in almost constant contact during the day and you would come by when you were able.  Sometimes it was the equivalent of a three-way quickie, other times we'd lie in bed for hours talking, fucking, holding each other.

There were some deep emotional undercurrents about this time.  We had serious conversations about the poly lifestyle and what that meant for us.  I suppose that I had something of an epiphany one evening, about 4-5 months into our relationship.  You two were going on a date to the ballet and I was staying home.  After a quick tumble, you two began to dress and get fancy for the show.

As I lay on the bed, I could see you both getting ready in the bathroom.  You were both playful and loving, displaying unmistakeable body language.  I was overcome with emotion.  I recall thinking how beautiful this was and how lucky I was to have this in my life.  I got up, hugged you both, and told you my thoughts.

When you came home and talked about the show, about how you held hands, made out, and even copped a feel during the show like teenagers, my heart was huge with love.  I couldn't believe our fortune in finding each other and it working so perfectly.  I should have known better.

We knew you had a boyfriend.  We also knew you were keeping him in the dark about your ""affair"" with us.  That makes us complicit.  You two were on the outs, of that we were well aware.  Perhaps we used that as justification, maybe we decided that your relationship was your business, probably we just didn't care.  The positives of this arrangement were far outweighing the negatives, even accounting for karma.

A few months later, it was a different story.  Your boyfriend was and is a douchebag.  Even his parents acknowledge that fact, openly.  But your boyfriend simultaneously gets an influx of cash and starts treating you better (one could never say ""treating you right"" in his case).  Cue your gradual distancing and departure from our lives.

Your reasons, while flawed, were beyond refute.  You had committed to him.  You loved him.  You can't see yourself with anyone but him.  You don't like having same sex relations anymore.  I was blindsided and distraught, my rational side won out though and I was able to keep my shit together enough to keep a straight face as I wished you well.  My partner, however, was crushed.  She cried, like I have never seen her cry before.

We agreed in the beginning that, no matter what, we would always stay friends and we did.  Damn it to hell, but it was hard.  Back at the same gatherings, broken inside and acting like we had not a care in the world.  I didn't realize it at the time, but you kept my heart on a string, dragging me around behind you on the hint of some future.  All lies.

It's been about two years since we split, we still talk occasionally.  I still try to be your friend.  You're back to talking about splitting up with your boyfriend.  Coincidentally you've also found someone else to secretly fill your void, both figuratively and literally.

Oddly, it's a same sex relationship, the kind you said you didn't want. Expressing trepidation and expecting judgement, you hesitantly told me this.  I felt a bit raw about the whole deal but you're my friend.  I told you that we still loved and cared for you greatly and if this is something that makes you happy, you should go for it.  I was wrong, yet again.

This time is no different, actually, it's worse.  Your boyfriend still doesn't know.  You've upped the ante, however, by snatching the interests of someone already in the midst of a potentially budding relationship.  A member of your family and their spouse met someone.  Something has been going on there, even though you're not sure what.  Even with them professing their love for the new someone in *written word* you're still willing to sleep with that someone.

Several years ago I fell for a girl that was beautiful, funny, and full of light and life.  You are no longer that person.  You have allowed your unwillingness to confront breaking up with your boyfriend to corrupt your very personality.  You are spineless, deceitful, manipulative and cruel.  I find you emotionally toxic.  I rescind my blessing on your new relationship as I rescind my offer of friendship.

The idea of you will always have a place in my heart.  If the beautiful person you were ever lives again, re-introduce us, I love old friends.

I have been nothing but completely open with her and part of our agreement was that we hid nothing. If we were having feelings (sexual, personal, spiritual, etc.) for any other that we would tell each other. I have held true to this agreement without fault. So much that I have found myself turning away sexual relationships (ie: I hadn't had sex with anyone else but her). Now in defense, we have experienced together multiple sexual partners as a pair but never by myself.

Well, it came to light that she has been exercising affairs without my knowledge. I won't go into detail but it involves her going to bars with her friends and talking up a guy for drinks and taking things from there. Now, I don't mind as long as there's disclosure with me but there isn't any. I decided to investigate further.

In my discoveries or her habits, she openly lies about our relationship. Claiming to be divorced for a couple years. She says the marriage went down due to (get this) her husband cheating on her. That he admitted to it one night while he was drunk. 

Needless to say, I'm a bit baffled. I'm not sure how to handle this volatile situation. She continues to act ""nice"" as if nothing has happened. I'm sure she will continue this behavior as she has cheated before we were polyamorous.

we had come to an agreement during an argument once, however, that if she and i went out where her other beau was also, she would be with me since she went out with me. she promised me that, that she would never choose someone else over me if i was there.

and i think that happened last night. we all three, her, her husband/my boyfriend, and i, had gone out to a costume party at a bar. i didn't find out until we were walking in that he other beau was going to be there, and while i may not have been incredibly successful at it, i was certainly trying to still put on a good face and have a good time.

we weren't even there for 10 minutes before she said she was going to go say hi to her beau, and then she never came back. the only time i saw her was when *i went to find her.* after letting her know that i was upset and walking away, i saw her a bit later and tried to talk to her. she suggested that maybe i should leave and that she didn't want to deal with it right now.

so, i left. and i think that that may have been the last straw and it's breaking my heart.",,False,self,t5_2qu5n,False,,,True,t3_1eml0m,http://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1eml0m/i_think_it_might_be_over/,

My problem is with people claiming that rules and hierarchies are fundamentally *bad* or *wrong*. Basically, people need to check their damn privilege and/or stop acting so entitled.

Privilege might not be quite the right word here, but basically it comes down an issue approximating mental ableism. Look: you've got your insecurities and emotions under control. Great! Good for you. *Not everyone does.* Some people have trouble controlling their emotions. Some people have serious self-esteem issues or fears of abandonment underlying their jealousy issues. Maybe a guy with an OPP has deep-rooted insecurities about his masculinity that just aren't triggered by his girlfriend dating other women. Insecurities and emotional problems can be rooted in bad experiences in people's past or just neurological issues.

Rules, hierarchies, and structures can create feelings of safety and security, especially during the early stages of opening up an existing relationship. Stop morally judging other people for not being saints of emotional stability. Human beings are not rationality-bots. Fixing insecurities is not easy, and many people struggling in life do not have the time and emotional energy available to do it.

If rules and hierarchies make the people in a couple or triad or whatever happy, then they’re good rules. If they don’t make you happy, then you shouldn’t start dating those people. And if you feel that an existing relationship should restructure itself and what makes the people in it happy to accommodate you, then you’re *extremely entitled*. If the other members of an existing relationship value each other more than you, or value the feeling of (or actual) safety and security their set of rules or hierarchies provide more than you, that's perfectly within their right. Despite your feelings of entitlement to be on equal, non-hierarchical footing with them, they really don't owe you anything! Be grateful for the depth of relationships people are willing to give you and stop demanding more.

The problem? As she's pointed out, sex is happening less often. She's been extremely horny and - reading between the lines - unsatisfied.

Also, I can see how people could be in a non-monogamous relationship that does not include polyamory. The term ""open relationship"" is imprecise, but comes closest to how I would define a non-monogamous relationship that is not poly (e.g., dating or sleeping with other people but not necessarily incorporating them into your life the same way you would your primary partner).

I'm not sure how to deal with it with my partner, I love him to pieces, he has a fairly liberal mindset, and aside from this we have a very happy and fullfilling relationship but whenever I've ever even tried mentioning it to him he has completely shut it down, felt that it was selfish, completely non-understandable and things just eventually get to the point where they've boiled over after a while and eventually the argument ends with nothing resolved. 

I've cheated on him in the past and fessed up to it and apologized, and we worked through it but I am worried it will happen again because my own personal morals are not against going out and developing various relationships, getting to know people, etc., while in a relationship.

Neither of us had really been with others much during that time - FWB here and there. Last fall I tried to make the jump from non-mono to poly, and started dating a close friend of ours. One evening there was a threesome with my wife and oso. Things didn't last long for various reasons (I got sick, wife got sick, etc.), but she's still one of our closest friends. Even before dating, we'd always been touchy feely - occasionally camming, cuddling on the couch when she was over, etc. Always someone I cared about like family.

Fast forward to a couple of weeks ago. Friend starts spending a lot of time with a longtime FWB, and ends up going on vacation with him. It was at that point I realized that my feelings for her were more than just those I've had for other close friends. I realized I love her. 

I'm beginning to think we're actually an emotional triad. We spend almost every weekend together. Our sleeping arrangements can vary at times (wife and friend will sleep in our room with me in the guest room, friend and I will sleep in our room with wife in guest room). When I decide I'm ready to stop being mono, friend is only person that I'd be allowed to be intimate with in the bed my wife and I share. My family invites friend to family gatherings. While they don't know we are non-monogamous, they know friend is always with us. Although, I'm beginning to wonder if some family members having started to wonder...

It's funny. When my wife and I first agreed to being non-monogamous, it was because we'd both been unfaithful in our previous monogamous relationships. We wanted the ability to have sex with others without emotional strings involved. Now it seems we've hit the opposite, we've got all the emotional but none of the physical. Yet, it all feels right.

We'd had issues communicating about our sexual wants in the past, and he framed it as a way for us to expand our horizons and figure ourselves out while protecting our relationship. 

I agreed, with the caveat that we continue to work and communicate to improve our relationship. Our marriage, we agreed, was built on solid ground and would be fine if we respected each other and proceeded thoughtfully.

Long story short, things went well with his first girlfriend. I had a rockier time finding partners. Suddenly, he wanted to date someone else. He started acting secretive, going out of his way to prevent me from meeting the new girlfriend or sharing anything at all about her/their relationship, staying overnight with her without telling me he was going to be gone (I liked his first girlfriend a lot--we all met through a local poly group, it was occasionally bumpy but went alright).

Two months ago, he suddenly told me our relationship is toxic and broken and will never work. I ended my other relationships and asked him to end his and to enter counseling with me. He refused. We're separating.

1332757515.0,32,self.polyamory,re0n8,A little help... I'm being replaced by my SO's secondary (who I don't even like) and it hurts,41,9,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/re0n8/a_little_help_im_being_replaced_by_my_sos/,"SO and I have been together for more than half our lives. We are best friends, married. 

For more than a year I have felt that he is no longer putting energy into our relationship. I have raised the issue many times. I have asked that he stop actively trying to seek new partners and rather work on us. Not that we not be poly, but that while neither of us had a serious secondary we don't go out of our way to find one, rather put that time and energy into working on our relationship. 

He continued to spend hours every day finding new women to chat to and see if he could date. 

Our sex became more and more monotonous, essentially not much more than masturbating each other - no real connection or experimentation, just release. 

I've been growing more and more unhappy, but remained committed to fixing things.

He then met another woman who he really likes. Queue end to any and all sexual interation with me - even stopped calling me my sexy nicknames and used them with her. 

What makes it harder is that I don't even know why he likes her - she is not very smart (he usually values intelligence), shares none of our same values, does not identify as poly, and comes across to me (and others who have met her) as immature. My ""crazy"" warning bells go off big time with her - she laughs proudly and jokes about very destructive manipulative behavious she employed in her last serious relationship. 

I expressed all this to my SO early on, but he flat out refused to take my opinion on her and continued to pursue her, to the detriment of our relationship (increased neglect). 

I don't know what to do. I feel like he has not desired me sexually for a long time (I am in good shape, I think I am attractive, just not to him), and has not come to the party to work on that. 

Now he's met someone new who he is very attracted to. Its even more hurtful that I just don't see what he sees in her. Maybe if they had lots in common it would be easier - it certainly was easier in the past when his interests were people I also liked. 

Is this it? Is my lifelong relationship and marriage over? I'm broken.... 

I've told all of this to him, he admits he has neglected me sexually but doesn't know where to go from here. 

He argues that this is just part of the whole ""poly people have their needs met by mutiple people"" thing. I get that, but its hard for me because I AM attracted to him, I want to have a sexual relationship with him. I've always felt, and he knows this, that its fine to get needs met outside IF we can't meet those needs. If I can meet those needs, then there's no need to find someone else for that. There's nothing I won't do for him sexually, so it really is just about me. If everything between us were really good and strong then yeah, sure have secondaries for even more, but right now I feel neglected and replaced rather than added to, if that makes sense. 

How do I learn to just be ok with being in a sexless marriage and friendship? 

EDIT: Thank you all for your valuable inputs, as always. We had a good serious discussion yesterday that for the first time was pro-active and solution-oriented. We agreed to temporarily halt other relations until we are back in a good space. We will be focusing on date nights and making more effort to explore intimacy together, again.

We've had our ups and downs as much as any other couple, and since opening our relationship almost a year ago, we've for sure gone through some pretty big changes, as I'm sure everyone does while allowing for those changes to set in and take shape.

We have always had a dynamic of me having a higher sexual appetite, and that for sure factored into our opening.

I could accept that my partner just wasn't extremely sexually charged, and that having sex only a couple of times a week was going to be the status quo (since that's how it has always been), and the sex that we did have was great, and i was able to get a little extra on the side so i didn't feel crazy all the time, and that was great.

Now, I'm starting to really question our relationship and his attraction to me.

The thing is, He never has any loss of libido when it comes to having sex with other women.
Even if we had sex the day before, if the opportunity came up to see someone else, he has no problems getting aroused and preforming the act, when he's with someone other than me.

I realize, someone new (or fairly new) is going to carry a lot more excitement than the same old person he's naked hundreds of times, and if there were some NRE going on here, I wouldn't even be wasting your time, but I'm talking about random FWB, or mutual friends that sometimes end up part of group sex, so there isn't really a presence of a crush, just random hooking up.

I've seen him with these other women in sexual situations and his energy and interest is way higher than it is with me. 
He gets really into. There's grunting and hair pulling and ass slapping... great awesome enthusiastic sex. The kind of sex I wish we were having.

I feel like he has no passion for me. I feel like I've been misled into believing that he has a low sex drive, and its actually me that's the problem.

I try hard to get his attention... I flirt, I send sexy messages, I go around in sexy little outfits... all in an effort to get him to notice and want me, but even after 4,5,6 days of not having sex, I can barely turn his head. 
I try ignoring him and not initiating sex, hoping after a time, he'll get so worked up he'll jumpme, but he doesn't even notice, and eventually i get fed up of waiting and just initiate, which is often rejected, making me feel all that much worse.

I am not unattractive. In fact, I am considered to be very attractive by most. I'm a fun, outgoing, happy individual. I am in good shape, I take care of my self, and I'm always very enthusiastic and giving in bed.

We've talked about ways to improve his low sex drive, like exercise, diet, coming up with kinky things we can do together...
I've mentioned many times that maybe talking to a doctor to make sure everything is fine there, and he assures me that he's not happy with his libido either and that he wants it to change, yet no action is taken!

I don't want to feel insecure and like he enjoys having sex with other people more than he does with me, but right now that's completely how I feel.

Does any one have experiences like this? Any advice? Tips? Insight?

I've been bisexual as far as I can remember, but I met my husband and fell in love with him and knew I wanted to spend the rest of my life with him.

Unfair.  and weird. :)  

We met a woman in our social circle who is poly.  She was interested in both my husband and I and it opened our eyes and minds to the possibilities in polyamory.  He found some awesome articles in this subreddit (thanks everyone that participates here!) which helped a lot.  Unfortunately things went way too fast and when we tried to back off it wasn't taken well.  Which of course led to it ending.

The icing on the cake in all of this lies with some other friends who are poly but we didn't even REALIZE were interested in us.  We hadn't even considered it because the pairing would be completely hetero but, well, here we are expressing interest in each other and getting to know each other.  

It's some crazy cosmic shit going on.. almost too much for me to think is coincidence.  Life experiences and interests and philosophies and even our children get along.  I am just along for the ride here, and am liking the view. :)
