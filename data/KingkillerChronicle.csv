When the Chronicler is trying to break down Kvothe's resistance, one of the charges he makes is that 'Some people say there is a new Chandrian, with hair as red as the blood he spills'.  Kvothe doesn't respond with anger, or incredulity, but an almost weary acceptance- the important people know the difference.

When the skindancer at the end is looking for Kvothe, it asks him 'Te Rhintae'; obviously too close to the Adem 'Rhinte' term for whatever the Chandrian are to be chance.

But the roots of this madness aren't in particulars which are meant to draw the eye; they're deeper.  They're in silence that clings to a man.  A silence that belongs to him, like a sign presaging him.  The silence of a man who is waiting to die- who should have died *twice* when fighting the scrael.

*What would you want to happen if you died before book three?*

He said he wasn't sure if he would want anyone to write his books if he died. He finally said if he could get a committee made up of Peter S. Beagle, George R. R. Martin and Neil Gaiman to write it, he'd be OK.

*Is a day longer than 24 hours in your world?*

Well, a day can be perceived as being longer or shorter based upon one's perspective, but that doesn't really mean it is. Or does it? Maybe it does, good question.

*Tinkers seem to be very important in your world. Is there anything about them we don't know?*

If you notice, any map shows a Tinker on it. A Tinker is a sign of civilization, no Tinker, no civilization. No civilization, no map. Tinkers are... special. That's all I'll say.

*Why do addicts of denner resin have white, shiny teeth?*

When I was making my world, I realized every culture has had some way to escape reality, and a lot of them were bad. And my world needed something like that to make it more real. The white teeth? I just made that shit up.

*If E'lir means ""seer"" and Re'lar means ""speaker"", what language is it and what does El'the mean?*

Hmm. Good question. Next?

*How many times were you rejected by publishers before you were finally published?*

Dozens. A rejection is a sign you're trying. Celebrate your rejections. You've made it farther that most people.
(This one was my favorite).

Some things he spoke about:
Kilvin, and all the Cealdish, (pronounced Cheldish) are black, including Wilem.
Four Corners isn't the name of the world, its just what it is called on the map. He asked us if we wanted to know the real name. We all said, ""Yeah!"" and he fudged and wouldn't tell us.
It took him fourteen years from inception to publication.
Someone asked him why he writes fantasy. I won't go into all of it (it was a long answer), but he ended by saying all of ""us"" (fantasy geeks) were thinkers and generally smart people. He still identifies with us nerds. You can tell he doesn't think to highly of himself and is thankful he is just a nerd that done good.

He was a great guy, very generous and down-to-Earth. Said he would stay as late as the last person there. He posed for pics any way you wanted (within reason I guess) and would pretty much sign any way you asked. He spent time with each person in line and suggested humorous ways to take the pictures, (""Let's everyone do crazy eyes!"").

All in all, a great night and a wonderful guy.

1370646328.0,73,self.KingkillerChronicle,1fw7y1,My Kingkiller Theory - The beautiful game (Spoiler),88,15,49,http://www.reddit.com/r/KingkillerChronicle/comments/1fw7y1/my_kingkiller_theory_the_beautiful_game_spoiler/,"Hi everybody I'm new here and want to share my thoughts and theories with you. 
First off, I'm sorry for my poor english because its not my first language (I'm german). This link will contain spoilers!
I have read and heard both books a dozend times. I was researching almost daily new theories of you guys and think I have read almost all of  them all. I'm really hooked on these stuff. I don't think that Patrick Rothfuss has giving us already the key to unravel the story yet, but I try to give some new thoughts to your amazing theories.

First off I want to call some irrefutable facts which everybody needs to know.

A: Kvothe is the son of Nethalia Lackless:
Ok you remember the end of the rhyme of Arliden about his wife. - not tally a lot less - Nethlia Lackless.
I didn't have the option to unravel this, because I've read the story in german. But I think this have to be evidence enough. I've first read about this theory in Joe Waltons ""Under the wagon thread"". Credits to her at this time. 

B: Cinder is denfintly Master Ash. Maybe Bredon is Cinder too because of some 'Glamour-magic', but Cinder is Ash. When Kvothe is looking for a name for Dennas Patron he uses his naming-skills:
""Frederick the Flippant. Frank. Feran. Forue. Fordale."" Feran - Fe/ Forue - ru/ Fordale - le - Ferule.
This have to be evidence enough.

Here are my thoughts:

1. Cinder: Cinder is alive! Kvothe is very carefully telling us the story. Carefully in consideration of telling us true Names. He told us Cinders true name once. The first time when Haliax named Cinder, it was ""Ferula"". 
But when the Adem gives him the true names of the Seven, it was ""Ferule, chill and dark of eye"". Which I think is the true name(see
above - Feran, Forue, Fordale). We know that it is dangerous to call these names numerous times, because the
person you name, can hear you and even know where you at. Thats the reason why he changed this name. The same thing with ""Cyphus- bears 
the blue flame."" But in the story with Tarborlin told from Marten, it was ""Scyphus-the Soccerer-king"". I think this is an
evidence that he's alive too. 

2. The Silence: I think Kvothe already killed one of the Seven and therefore became one of the Seven. In the discussion between Arliden and Ben about the Chandrian, they call their signs and one of them was a 'non-natural Silence' (Maybe from 'Grey Dalcenti, never speaks'). And this is probably the one Kvothe killed because now the ""Silence"" belongs to Kvothe. The Chandrian are always seven. And when Kvothe killed one of them, he maybe is cursed to be one of them, to stuff the hole he made.

3. The thrice-locked-chest: I think the man who is waiting to die, is a ""man""(Chandrian) in the thrice locked box(maybe Cinder). Remember when Bast knocked at the box and then Kvothe asked him ""what would you do if your knocking get a respond(or an anwser)?"" The Box is constructed with iron and copper. Maybe the copper is to hold the Rhinta and the iron to let him feel a constant pain.
Remember the heavy weight of the box. They say the Chandrian can't die but maybe there is a way (copper?), maybe Kvothe will sacrifice himself like Telhu with Encanis. I think the one in the box is a decoy bird, which leads me to:

4. The beautiful game: Kvothe is setting a trap. A trap for the Seven. The sword Folly, can't rust because its
not iron( maybe copper). It cannot fall down from the wall because of the Ruah wood. The Ruah
wood cannot decay. Then there is something with these brass bound barrels. Brass is something
of a copper alloy. Maybe he will stick them in there. But I think there was only three barrels,
not seven or six. Hmm? But these things are all prepared for an Chandrian attack(rotting wood, rusting iron, brittling bricks etc.) I think he have chosen the place and the time well, exactly like with those Scraels.
He have chosen a village where almost only old people live. People who have lived there lives, excepting one - the 'Smiths-apprentice'. And that was the one he wanted to save.(and at one time he tried to warn Graham too, that he should be ready to defend himself) He knows everybody in this
village (Newarre-Nowhere) will die. That is not the way of Bushido, sorry i mean Lethani, but
it is for the greater good. But he wanted to save the apprentice and that was Lethani. And this
whole trap - isnt both of it. It is the ""beautiful game"". A trap in a trap etc.


5. Alchemie: Kvothe has lost all magic skills excepting one. There is one magic you dont need body or mental
skills. Alchemie - there for you need knowledge. Alchemie is the form of magic which bored Kvothe
and he didn't learn in his story so far. But we know that he is Alchemie-skilled in the real time.
He knows the Cellum Tinkture etc. He wants Bast to learn Alchemie. I think Alchemie is a big key weapon in fighting the Seven. 

Some Alchemie: Cyphus is related to copper. Cyprus. Cyprus is the Island where Copper came from. Coppers(Cuprum) liguistic origin came from the word Cyprus.
Cinder is related to mercury. Remeber he moves like mercury. Originally the word mercury meant ""living silver"".
Stercus is in thrall of iron. 
I've read a great theorie about the seven alchemie Symbols of the ancient time: 
lead, tin, silver, mercury, iron, copper and finally gold,
I think everyone of the Seven is related to one and is bound with them,like Stercus with
iron and Cyphus with copper.And I think they can be used against them. 
Aurum for example means gold in latin. I think Auri is a key to this puzzle too.

The blue fire(or flame): Ok, Cyphus bears the blue flame and Cyphus could be related to copper. But why flames are turning blue in his presence? Laurian told Abenthy that a blue flame can be caused by natural gas, which is true. I googled a bit about the phenomen blue flame, and the easiest method to produce blue fire is to use copper chloride. Just spread copper chlorid over a campfire(or hearthfire) and the flames will turn blue. (When you burn copper sulphat you will get a blue-green flame). Another important attribute of copper chloride is that it will chorode most metals. Iron corrosion can be precipitated by copper chlorid. Remember that one sign of the Chandrian is rusting iron. This doesn't fit the theorie that every Chandrian is related to one sign, and Stercus seemed related to iron. It's just a thought. Maybe Cyphus or Stercus abstract copper chlorid somehow? Ok, that sounds weird, but in my head it had made more sense. I have read that Patrick Rothfuss studied chemical engineer. I think that Chemie and Alchmie will be very significant in 'Day 3.'

Kvothes weapons against the Chandrian:
(We know that demons fear pure Fire, Iron and mirrorglass(and the holy name of god, of course))

- Alchemie
- Key
- Coin
- Candle
- Folly(copper, or magic iron?) 
- the Waystone Inn itself:

Tarborlin was in a prison of stone and he only had a coin, a candle and a key. Kvothe is in a big stone-house(maybe waystones) and had these weapons too.
Maybe the Waystone Inn is made of big waystones. The Chandrian don't appear near waystones.
Why? We know that waystones standing on safe places. Maybe the Waystones handicap the Chandrian in some way? The VALARITAS-Door is a big waystone too. Kvothe told us about an place called Faeriniel(when he told Sim and Wil the story about Sceop).
He said that this is a place you cannot find when you looking for it. You only can find it when you travel to another place.
I think the Waystone Inn is on this place(Newarre). There often appear travellers like at the 
beginning of TNOTW, or the possesed soldier, or the Chronicler, or the two soldier at the end of TWMF, etc.
The Waystone Inn attract them like a lodestone. We know that waystones attract people. They draw them somehow magnetic. Maybe waystones don't brickle by an Chandrian attack.

I think the Chronicler is more then he seems. There is something important about him. Yes i know he's a Lochees (Lackless). Maybe at the end oft the story he will be the hero of the KKC. Kvothe tells him the story for a reason.  It is not in Kvothes nature to tell his story just to demystify himself for the afterworld. I think he is part of Kvothes game. The story he tells is a part of his game. He is luring them with his story. 
So what about Bastas? Hmm. Maybe he is not so sympathetic to Kvothe as he claims to be. But Kvothe is too clever and too much of an actor. He is acting infront of Bast and he plays him like a lute. I think Bast is Felrurians child and want something from Kvothe. He want something from Kvothe, not from Kote and thats why he wants his old Reshi back. 

By the way, there are some thoughts I can't really back up but i will list them anyway: 
The Symphathie-Crime against Kvothe don't come from Ambrose. I don't think so. Maybe someone else attacked him with his blood. The same thing with these two assassins. Maybe Ambrose don't send them. Someone has his hidden hand on Kvothe since the beginning of the story. Why did Scarpi know his name. Why did Lorren know Arliden. Why did Denna say it's her job to know things about kvothe. Why did Denna appear everywhere Kvothe goes? Why did Threpe flatter on Kvothe? Why did Bredon flatter on Kvothe? Why did sometimes stranges people appear in the story(for example before his ship-journey or when he left Vintas and wanted to throw Meluans ring away). I think Kvothe is watched and controlled by a gray eminence.

The Univesity is not what it seems to be. It is not a place where some teachers are really excited for to teach you powerfull names, so you can get happy with them. Elodin said Kvothe doesnt know to what he commits himself. He said the University is not a big playground. I think the University is a big watchtower for the VALARITAS-Door. The masters are teaching them these names for some reason. Why is Elodin so enthusiatic to teach Kvothe the name of the wind? I hope you can help me with this thoughts.

Another thing i noticed is that Puppet is allowed to have candles in his room in the library. Maybe Lorren was not flipping because he was in fear that the books catch fire, but rather cause the four-plate-door can be affected by fire somehow. Maybe there is something alchemistic with this door too. Remember the four Elements of Alchemie: Fire, Water, Air and Earth.

Well, I'm sorry for the long post and my bad english(and my terrible grammar), I'm trying to improve it. I hope you can give me some feedback on my theories.

http://asoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/topic/48507-the-wise-mans-fear-iii-spoilers-and-speculation-within/page__st__20

This is a link into the third thread out of seven consecutive such threads on the Song of Ice and Fire forums about Wise Man's Fear. I was reading some of the posts and they had a lot of ideas in that I haven't seen around Reddit, so I thought I'd bring a few of my favourite ones over. I apologise if anything I say has already been discussed since I can't actually recall what I've seen where, but I am certain that some parts haven't so it should be good :)


Currently my favourite theory (that in fairness is less theory and more obvious once you can see it) is that Denna has been casting magic for all of the second book. Near the beginning of the book she asks Kvothe's friends how magic works. Specifically she asks about a kind of magic where you write things down and they become true for whoever reads them. She also specified that the things would come true even if the reader didn't understand what he was reading. During the conversation she was drawing symbols on the table with her hand and Kvothe's friends dismissed the idea out of hand without asking questions. Denna seems unperturbed by this and more thoughtful.

Later in the book Denna travels to Yll, learns about Yllish story knots and spends the rest of the book tying them into her hair. They are mentioned often, but there are a few significant instances. In the first, Kvothe reads her hair as saying 'lovely' to which Denna appears ""incredulous and slightly horrified"". She quickly takes the knot out her hair and asks Kvothe what he thinks now. He says he liked it better before and she responds that that is the point. She also insists that it is a damn sight more than ""Almost a story knot"" and explains that they are meant to be read by feeling rather than by looking.

The next incident is brief but probably significant. Denna and Kvothe are taking shelter in a hayloft when Kvothe promises not to try to seduce her. She says something to the effect of ""Oh really?"" and begins to tie a knot in her hair, but apparently thinks better of it.

Finally, when they are in the stream at the end of the second book, Kvothe says to her ""love me"" to which Denna responds by stiffening up and tying a knot in her hair that Kvothe reads as ""Don't speak to me"". He bites back what he is about to say, claiming that he is not so thick as to not take such an obvious sign, but as soon as she realises what she has done she removes the knot again and Kvothe immediately speaks to her to give her ring back.

All of this considered, it seems tremendously likely to me that Denna has found a form of magic whereby she can write something down and the person reading it changes according to it regardless of whether they understand it. I think it is also probably important that Denna says the knots are meant to be read by feeling rather than by looking. This might mean that looking doesn't ordinarily count as reading them, so she is braiding them into her hair to affect someone who is in the habit of touching her hair.

The final point to be made about this theory is that Herme falls ill shortly after he promises to teach Kvothe Yllish. This could be a sign that someone doesn't want Kvothe to understand Denna's knots, perhaps so she can manipulate him more easily, so they have poisoned Herme.



The other significant discussion that I don't think has been mentioned here before is the discussion about Selitos. The evidence for anything about him is much less concrete, but the general consensus is that he is not necessarily the good guy that Skarpi made him out to be. One of the most popular opinions is that he could be the Cthaeh somehow. This is backed up from the fact that in Skarpi's story he is meant to lose an eye but gain better sight. He loses an eye, but the better sight is never clarified - it could be the sight of the future that the Cthaeh has. It has also been noted that based on the smell of the wood of the lackless box, it was probably made out of wood from the Rhinna tree where the Cthaeh resides. This fits in nicely because it is quite possible that the box contains the piece of obsidian that Selitos took his eye out with. He uses the blood on the Obsidian to curse Lanre so it could be hidden away to make sure Lanre can't acquire it and break his curse. If Selitos did turn out to be evil then it could be that he was the one who poisoned the seven Chandrian into becoming evil but, as in Denna's song, Lanre saw through his plan and marched on his cities. This would explain why the seventh city didn't burn, since it was Lanre's city. The ""Evil Selitos"" Theory is backed up by the girl with the charm telling Kvothe that when she saw the Chandrian with an Amyr, the Amyr was the scariest of all of them.

The box also raises a few other interesting subjects. One of the childrens' rhymes contains the line ""lackless keeps her husband's rocks"". Kvothe seems to think that the box only contains one item, but a piece of obsidian would qualify as someone's rock. This raises the question of who the original lady lackless was. My favourite suggestion is Lyra, but that would need ironing out since she is supposed to be dead when Selitos takes his eye out. Kvothe also notices engravings on the box, so it could be that it is locked with an Yllish knot. 

I feel I have given way to rambling a bit - I am not good at organising my ideas. As a result, I will leave on a brief, well organised note. At some point in the second book Kvothe says """"I swear I won’t attempt to uncover your patron,"" I said bitterly. ""I swear it on my name and my power. I swear it by my good left hand. I swear it by the ever-moving moon."" "" Kvothe appears to have a significant latent talent for naming. As a result, he could also have some talent for shaping. One of the most popular theories everywhere is that Kvothe eventually kills Cinder. There is a lot of evidence to suggest that Cinder is Master Ash, and if he were then Kvothe would need to hunt him down to kill him. In the interludes at the Waystone Inn Kvothe appears to have lost his power and there are a number of scenes where his left hand is specifically mentioned as not working properly. Bast worries that he has lost who he is, which could be explained by him somehow losing his name, so this oath to Denna could be at least part of the reason for how he ended up as weak as he is in the present day.

That's all for now folks! As I say, I don't know how much of it is new ideas to reddit, but hopefully something in there can keep you entertained.

I just finished my second read through and I have to tell you....I really don't understand all the Denna hate. 

I know that the most argue they don't like who Kvothe becomes when he is around her or that she shows up unexpectedly everywhere or that she is flakey all the time but I love that about her. The way Pat sets up and progresses their relationship is my favorite part of the narrative. 

The moment that hooked me into the series hardest was the way she talked to Kvothe and depended on him in Trebon when she is all high and loopy. That's what got me really really invested in those two. Then came the chapter with the Cthaeh telling him how she cries for him at night and I had to put the book down and take a break otherwise I, an adult man, may have cried. 

At this point finding out what became of Denna and their relationship in the frame story is what I'm reading for. It was the fact he wanted to set her story straight that got him to tell the story to Chronicler in the first place. Before re-introducing her to the story he broke into a lengthy sermon about her, where he decorates her as perfect but is so sorrowful about it. I'm hoping for something beautifully tragic for them. I'm reasonably sure I'll get it.

But I thought you guys might find it interesting, I think they said Rothfuss wrote it himself

It was midmorning, and the autumn sun was hot as Jaime Lannister opened the door of the Waystone Inn. The place was oddly quiet, and he peered through the door, one hand resting lightly on his sword.

The taproom was empty except for a dark-haired young man lounging behind the bar. “Can I help you?”

Jaime stepped inside. “I’m looking for the owner. We have… business.”

The young man stood up straighter. “He’s stepped out for a moment. You’re Jaime?”

Jaime frowned slightly as he looked the young man over. “I am. And you are?”

“Bast.” The young man said with a grin. “He said I’m to make you comfortable if you showed up early. He shouldn’t be more than an hour or two. Can I get you something to drink?”

Jaime moved to sit at the bar. “I don’t suppose you have any decent wine out here in the ass end of nowhere?”

“What do you mean by decent?” Bast asked.

Jaime waved a hand dismissively. “Why don’t you bring out your best bottle? I’ll tell you if it’s something worth drinking.”

Bast looked offended as he headed down the basement stairs, returning a moment later with a dusty bottle.

“Something off the top shelf, I hope,” Jamie said.

“Something from behind the shelf,” Bast said proudly. “I can’t keep track of what the wines are called in these parts, but I’m guessing when you hide a bottle, it’s the good stuff.”

Bast worked a corkscrew and opened the bottle with a deft flourish. Then he brought out a tall wineglass, poured an inch of deep red wine into it, and held it out with an ingratiating smile.

Jaime made no motion to take it. “You drink half.”

Bast glanced down at the glass, then back up, his smile fading. “It tells you a lot about a man when he says something like that.”

Jaime showed his teeth in a sharp, joyless expression that had the shape of a smile. “It says a lot about you,” he said smugly, “that you aren’t willing to drink it.”

Bast gave a dismissive sniff, picked up the glass, and took a mouthful of the dark wine. Then he raised his eyebrows and made an appreciative noise as he picked up the bottle and eyed the engraving on the neck. “I can see why he hid this one,” Bast said, pouring more into the glass. “That’s just lovely.”

Jaime shrugged. “Ah well,” he said. “You know what they say. Better safe than sore,” he held out his hand.

Bast brought the glass close to his chest, his blue eyes icy. “This is my drink now.” He took another sip of the wine. “Rude guests go thirsty. Drink your own piss for all I care.”

Jaime’s expression went dark. “I’m not here for you,” he said. “But killing you wouldn’t be far out of my way.”

They stared at each other for a while across the bar. After a moment, Bast set the bottle down hard on the bar. “Fine,” he said, nudging it so it slid forward. “I won’t insult you by offering you a glass or anything. I could poison that, too. You’ll just have to drink it right from the bottle…” Bast grinned. “Like an unlettered cretin.”

Jaime picked up the bottle. “Boy,” he said. “If it makes you feel brave to show your teeth to me, go right ahead. But I’ll only tolerate so much.” He took a drink straight from the bottle, paused, and took another slower drink as if to make sure of something. He looked surprised. “Well, that is good, isn’t it?”

Bast nodded and took another sip.

“Did he say when he’ll be back?”

Bast looked down at his feet. “A couple hours,” he said with an odd tone in his voice. “He wasn’t expecting you until noon.”

“Don’t look so glum, boy,” Jaime said. “Look at the bright side. In a couple hours I’ll be on my way and you’ll be the owner of this fine inn.”

Bast looked up and his eyes were anxious. “I don’t suppose I could convince you to call this off?”

Jaime gave a humorless laugh and took another drink. “Good lord, boy. Why on earth would I do that?”

“Human decency?” Bast said.

Something about this struck the golden-haired man as funny, and he erupted into a great belly laugh that lasted for nearly a minute. Eventually he trailed off, wiping the water from his eyes. “You just earned yourself a tip, boy.” He shook his head in disbelief and took another drink.

“It’s just that…” Bast began.

“Look, boy.” Jaime leaned forward onto the bar. “I can tell you’re a talker. You probably learned that from him. I hear he’s got a silver tongue on him. Talked his way right out of the fight with the god-lion.” He gave Bast a serious look, his eyes hard as flint. “But that isn’t going to do him any good here.”

Jamie took another drink from the bottle before continuing. “You see, I’ve done some asking around. Your Kvothe has a bit of a reputation. Clever, quick. Devil with a sword. Strong as a bear. He can call down fire and lightning.” Jaime shook his head. “But I think all that is just stories. And the parts that aren’t just stories, he lost long ago.” He looked around the empty inn. “He wouldn’t be hiding here if he still had a scrap of power to call his own.”

Bast looked dejected, but he didn’t say anything.

“I’ll offer him a chance to surrender.” Jaime said magnanimously. “As thanks for this excellent bottle of wine.” He took one last drink and pushed it away from himself on the bar. “That’s enough of that. Start to turn my head, otherwise.”

“He might surprise you.” Bast said.

“With what?” Jaime said, laughing again. “That sword has dust on it, and his magic’s gone from what I hear. His silver tongue isn’t any good on me. He doesn’t even play music any more. What’s left?”

“I need to show you something,” Bast said. “Come here behind the bar.”

Jaime turned his shoulders, then frowned, looking down at his feet.

“Never mind,” Bast said, starting to walk around the bar. “I’ll come over to you.”

“Why can’t I move my legs?” Jaime said, his voice quiet and incredulous.

“Sethora,” Bast said simply. “It tends to start with the legs. You can probably still move your arms. But be careful or you’ll….” Jaime turned on his stool and toppled messily to the floor. “…Yeah. You’ll do that.”

Jaime writhed a bit, turning onto his side. Moving his arms sluggishly he managed to pull a long knife from his belt and throw it at Bast as came out from behind the bar. But the throw went wild and sunk into one of the thick-timbers of the tables.

Bast approached where the big man lay, stepping gracefully as a dancer. He stayed well out of arm’s reach through the man’s final struggles, waiting until he saw the tall man’s breathing grow stiff and labored.

“It was in the wine,” Bast stepped close and brushed the man’s golden hair out of his eyes. “I can’t believe you managed to drink so much of it. You must have the constitution of an ox.”

“But you…” Jaime’s mouth shaped the words though he lacked the breath to say them.

“You think I wouldn’t drink poison for him?” Bast asked. “Then you don’t know anything about him.”

Bast met the man’s glassy eyes. “You’re right. He’s not what he used to be. He’s lost everything. No magic. No music. No joy. No hope. You know what he has? You know what’s left?” Bast leaned closer, his voice low and vicious. “Me!” He practically spat the word, his eyes were wild. “He has me!”

1375303915.0,64,self.KingkillerChronicle,1jg3i9,"Analyzing the Thaum, the apparent unit of energy used in the University.",71,7,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/KingkillerChronicle/comments/1jg3i9/analyzing_the_thaum_the_apparent_unit_of_energy/,"*Contains very minor non-spoiler information. And Math.*

*EDIT. Forgot to convert Kj to j. Changed figures throughout to correct after peer review.
*
So I was re-reading The Wise Man's Fear, and I noticed that Kvothe gives us enough information about the Thaum for us to work out it's real-world value.

During his tuition interview, he is asked ""Once an ounce of water is boiling, how much heat will it take to boil it completely away?""

Kvothe answers: 180 Thaums. Which is reckoned a ""Good-enough"" answer by one of the Masters.

Assuming an ounce is the same as 'our' ounce (given we are dealing with liquids, I'm assuming a fl. ounce), then we have;

1 ounce(fl) = 0.02957 L of water ≅ 0.02957 kilograms (**m**ass)

**L**atent heat of vaporization of water = 2260 KJ/Kg.

**Q**(energy)=**L****m**

Q=(0.02957)(2,260,000)

Q=66,820 Kilo-Joules

180 Thaums ≅ 67,000 Kilo-Joules

**1 Thaum ≅ 370 Joules**

In the Name Of The Wind, Master Kilvin estimates that the bone-tar released about 850 million Thaums. Our conversion rate brings that to around;

850,000,000 Thaum ≅ 316,400,000,000 Joules

The bone-tar came in a container that Kvothe calls ""a... cylinder... about four feet high and two across.""

Formula for volume of a cylinder;

V = π r^2 h

Converted to metric we get

V = (π)(.3)^2 (1.22)

V = 0.345 m^3

Comparing this volume to the heat produced by the combustion of the bone-tar, we can get a very rough estimate of the energy density of the bone-tar.

If 0.345m^3 of bone-tar releases 3.145x10^11 Joules of heat, then 1m^3 contains 9.17x10^11 J/m^3

(or 917 MJ/L)

(However this estimate is on the low side, I'm assuming that the cylinder was full, and that the outer dimensions were indicative of the interior volume, both of which are not true. But the true figure should be roughly in the same ballpark.)

Comparing this to a chemical we have a lot of everyday experience with like petrol, we get a slightly ~~disappointing~~ exciting result,

Petrol has an energy density of 4.73x10^7 J/Kg, along with a density of 838 Kg/m^3.

This gives 1m^3 of petrol an energy density of around 3.964x10^10 J/m^3 (I'm doing a good bit of rounding, according to Wikipedia, petrol has about 3.6 MJ/L, but I've found a lot of differing values elsewhere for the different physical properties of petrol.)

This means that for the same volume, petrol contains just ~~over 43 times as much energy as the bone-tar.~~ *under one twentieth as much energy as the bone-tar.*

~~To give you a better idea, here's a [graph](http://i.imgur.com/graAJRc.jpg) of energy densities, our fantastical bone-tar would lie on the red line (we have no reference for mass sadly).~~ *It would lie ten times off the height of the graph.*
~~It doesn't look as dangerous as it ounce did, does it?~~ By the forgotten gods it's scary stuff now. (Not *even* including the whole 'dissolving bone' part.)

But do not despair! According to Master Kilvin, the vast majority of the bone-tar did not combust, and was instead controlled by sympathy and neutralized chemically with lime. So most likely you can entirely ignore the last two thirds of this post. *Now you can be even more afraid.*

Tune in next week where we'll count every single seven word sentence Kvothe says to Denna, just in case they form some kind of bizarre poem.

And it doesn't seem to be clear whether the Thaum is a unit of energy on its own, or only refers to the treatment of energy when dealing with heat.

I just noticed this:

In NoTW, Kvothe turned down the strawberry fruit wine and rope deal the tinker offered. Later, he ran into Denna and found out that she likes strawberry fruit wine (but he didn't have any cause he refused the Tinker's offer). Then, while they were planning to kill the dragon, Denna's plan of luring it towards a cliff to shove it off required some rope to hang the bucket of denner resin over a tree branch. 

The consequence of not having some ropes on hand resulted in the town getting burn down.

In WMF, Kvothe once again turned down some wax that he can rub on his boots to keep them dry. And what do you know, he had some pretty miserable time camping out in the rain while tracking down bandits.

I think it's possible that Taborlin's legend, or at least part of it, is based on Kvothe, who managed to use the temporal distortion of the Fae to travel back in time. I've seen others suggest this before on this sub so I just wanted to point out a couple easter eggs in support of this idea that I've noticed as I read along.

During a campfire discussion in the Eld, Kvothe says he thinks of Taborlin's cloak of no particular color as being too dark to have a color. His cloak/shaed from Felurian is made of shadow, among other things.

The two cardinal directions in the Fae, as described by Felurian, are sometimes called ""Forward and Back"".

The much speculated upon point that Taborlin's key, coin and candle, if unconnected to Kvothe's first three gifts from Auri, would be an improbable coincidence.

When Bast and Chronicler are trying to encourage Kvothe regarding the Cthaeh, he gives a sort of fond, wistful laugh and says something like ""You're both so young"". This is probably the strongest tidbit to support the time travel idea, because Bast is over 100 years old if memory serves, and Chronicler had already written his book about the draccus when Kvothe was 15. Looking at it now, I'm kind of shocked I never realized the extent of the incongruity of his statement there.

And of course, when one of the townsfolk said ""You seem older,"" Kvothe responds, ""I am.""

This isn't really evidence, but Kvothe seems to make a point of saying several times ""I was no Taborlin the Great"", or other people saying to him something to the tune of ""You're clever, but you're no young Taborlin"". I just think it would be funny if we later discover that he actually is Taborlin.

I think you should all be able to extrapolate from the preceding paragraphs what my point is, and I don't feel like writing a conclusion. Thanks for reading.",,False,self,t5_2smxb,False,,,True,t3_17w76s,http://www.reddit.com/r/KingkillerChronicle/comments/17w76s/time_travel/,

1359164367.0,56,self.KingkillerChronicle,17ajc5,"Theory on Kvothe's Parentage (Long Post, Spoilers)",62,6,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/KingkillerChronicle/comments/17ajc5/theory_on_kvothes_parentage_long_post_spoilers/,"I've been forming a theory (no idea if it's original, but probably not) that Kvothe's father is Iax. Iax being the ancient shaper whom played a large part in constructing the Fae, eventually stole the moon, started the creation war, and ended up locked beyond the doors of stone. I think that Iax is indeed Kvothe's father and that there is a decent amount of evidence pointing toward this, which I'll try to point out...  

&gt;&gt;Note: I'm not saying that Arliden=Iax, more along the lines of Arliden might not be Kvothe's biological father.  

&gt;.  
&gt;First off, if you haven't read up on Kvothe's mother then you should probably do that. At this point it's pretty much confirmed that she is the runaway sister of Meluan Lackless, and this assumption plays a large part in the rest of my theory.  
.  
&gt;With that said, I'll start with what first tipped me off, Kvothe's eyes. So far no other humans we've seen have had eyes that change colors. We have seen Fae changing their eyes, but they always turn lighter in color, going fully blue then eventually white, which is pretty much the opposite of what Kvothe's do. However there was an interesting story told to Kvothe by Felurian. In this story she told him of the Fae's history and happened to mention a certain person with ""dark and changing eyes"": Iax.  

&gt;&gt;*Before I could ask more questions, Felurian took my hand and nestled the stone between our palms again. “this shaper of the dark and changing eye stretched out his hand against the pure black sky. he pulled the moon, but could not make her stay. so now she moves ’twixt mortal and the fae.”*  

&gt;.  
&gt;So, how could Kvothe's mother have managed to come into contact with Iax? Especially with him being in presumably the hardest place to reach in existence; beyond the doors of stone?  
.  
&gt;Well, I think that it is indeed a hard place to get to for most, but for the Lackless family it might not be so hard as it is for everyone else. This is because they seem to have their very own 'Door of Stone': the Lockless Door. My theory is that Laurian, being the young curious Lady Lackless who would eventually end up spending the rest of her life with a bunch of story collectors, at some point became a bit too interested in the riddle of her families storied ""Lockless Door"", and much like her son she had a knack for getting into places where she shouldn't be.  
.  
&gt;I think this entire story is actually hidden in a song in the early parts of the first book. Kvothe apparently hears a little girl chanting the song and then recites it for us, much to the dismay of his mother whom overhears it. The song is as follows, I'll also include another related song that appears later in the second book.  
.  
&gt;&gt;Song #1  
1. *""Seven things has Lady Lackless*  
2. *Keeps them underneath her black dress*  
3. *One a ring that’s not for wearing*  
4. *One a sharp word, not for swearing*  
5. *Right beside her husband’s candle*  
6. *There’s a door without a handle*  
7. *In a box, no lid or locks*  
8. *Lackless keeps her husband’s rocks*  
9. *There’s a secret she’s been keeping*  
10. *She’s been dreaming and not sleeping*  
11. *On a road, that’s not for traveling*  
12. *Lackless likes her riddle raveling.*  
.  
&gt;&gt;Song #2  
1. *""Seven things stand before*  
2. *The entrance to the Lackless door*  
3. *One of them a ring unworn*  
4. *One a word that is forsworn*  
5. *One a time that must be right*  
6. *One a candle without light*  
7. *One a son who brings the blood*  
8. *One a door that holds the flood*  
9. *One a thing tight-held in keeping*  
10. *Then comes that with comes with sleeping""* 
 
&gt;.  
&gt;Before I go further I should say what I think the songs are about. Song #2 I believe explains what is required to open the Lockless Door and its last line is about what is beyond the door. Song #1 I've concluded is the actual story of a Lady Lackless going beyond said door in secret.  
.  
&gt;That's probably not good enough, so here's my more indepth analysis of song #1.  
.  
&gt;Lines 1 and 2 are referencing that Lady Lackless does indeed have the seven things required for the door, but is keeping them hidden.   
Lines 3 - 8 are just pointing out what each thing is, mirroring the second song. I could go into what I think each of them are, but that isn't really relevant to this post.  
Line 9 again points out that she is keeping it secret, the other Lackless probably don't know what she is doing and I'm guessing if they did it wouldn't make them happy (maybe that's why she ended up with the Ruh, they found out? To protect Kvothe from them?).   
Lines 10 and 11 mirror the final line of song #2. I think beyond the door is some dream-like state or place (Doors of Stone analogous to the Doors of the Mind?), and this is where I believe she came into contact with Iax.  
Line 12 probably has some double meaning, like her love of riddles and how hearing about the door piqued her interest, or maybe it refers to her son with the whole Ruh/ravel = Ruhling/raveling, the riddle bit being that she is setting him up to be or be seen as a Ruh. It could even mean that she made this song herself.  
.  
&gt;This post is getting pretty huge, but that's most of it. I'll go ahead and add in this quote from Arliden that is quite amusing if this theory turns out to be true.  
.  
&gt;&gt;*My father was looking down at my mother, nestled under his arm. “How about it, woman? Did you happen to bed down with some wandering God a dozen years ago? That might solve our little mystery.”  
She swatted at him playfully, and a thoughtful look crossed her face...*",,False,self,t5_2smxb,1359177038.0,,writ,True,t3_17ajc5,http://www.reddit.com/r/KingkillerChronicle/comments/17ajc5/theory_on_kvothes_parentage_long_post_spoilers/,

I'll replicate it [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/KingkillerChronicle/comments/wbuwy/something_is_conspicuously_absent_from_kotes_inn/c5c9ywk):

&gt;I think an important part of what's locking Kvothe's magic away is that he is no longer Kvothe - he's Kote. Bast as much as says this a few times, pointing out that he just wants his Reshi back, and that it's the Chronicler's job to do it. I think it's more serious than Bast realizes, but that this is exactly the problem with Kote - Kvothe's gone, and Kote doesn't think he's coming back.

&gt;What gives this credence is the panicked reaction that Elodin has when Kvothe brings up the matter of changing names. Elodin's immediate thought is that Kvothe or Fela, both proven namers at this point, have changed their names. He implies that it is something truly catastrophic and reckless. I suspect that Kvothe changed his Name - not just his calling name, but is Sleeping Name. He removed everything that made him Kvothe the Arcane, Kvothe Bloodless, Maedre of Lightning, Flame and Broken Tree, and perhaps even Kvothe of the Ruh, who was to be the next Illien. He owns property, for Tehlin's sake. His sympathy and his naming are gone, and perhaps even his ear for music. Can you imagine one moment of foolishness, wiping that away?

&gt;Kvothe is not sitting in that inn, waiting to die. Kvothe is already dead. His corpse just wakes up in the morning and calls himself Kote. He knows everything that Kvothe did, remembers everything Kvothe did. But the wind is a stranger to him, his Alar is broken, and no music fills his soul. All that was cut away, leaving only a shell. The box that he made (we assume) no longer answers to Kote.

&gt;What's curious to me is that he seems to have retained his understanding of the Lethani - he not only remembered Adem hand-combat in his bout with the mercenaries, but also seems to retain the almost-mystic connection to Lethani that Sheyn displays with her ""perfect step"" - a feat Kote replicates in passing at the conclusion of The Wise Man's Fear. This either implies that Kvothe did not erase that part of himself (despite the fact that he and Caesura/Kaysera have parted ways, replaced by Folly) or that it is something that otherwise can survive the erasure that Kvothe conducted on himself.

Alright, now bear with me. I was thinking about misbehaving arcanists, like our beloved poisoner Caudicus. What does the University do about people like him? How can Master Dal stop Kvothe from making a sword that boils the blood of people it cuts? How could Master Arwyl stop one of his students from becoming the world's greatest poisoner? How does the University stop its sympathists from becoming assassins for hire - after all, one cadaver's heart can make a little hole in an aorta a thousand meters away, and it'll just look like a heart attack if it's done right. Presumably, the long and arduous career of most gillers acts as a way to weed out people of poor moral fiber (not that it seems to work for Ambrose or Hemme), and Master Dal, in particular, is very sensitive to the need to protect and defend the reputation of artifcery. But every system is fallible, and a clever king or other political force that could afford a ten- or twenty-year wait time for the abilities of an arcanist-assassin, or a poisoner who never fails, or a weaponsmith that can make his armies unstoppable.

And then an awful thought occurred to me. What if Kvothe didn't name-shape himself? What if the function of the Master Namer is not to just to guide students into becoming namers, but to protect the practice of naming itself? What if the role of the Master Namer is to protect the *world* from *arcanists*?

If Kvothe killed the/a/some King in a public and brutal display of malfeasance (and the stones are reportedly still cracked where it happened), how could the University respond? Send sympathists and alchemists to subdue him, then lock him up? Or send one man, the right man, to strip away the ability to name, the gift of sympathy, and the power of Alar? To make Kvothe as if he had never been - no more than a legend, dead in his time? We know that Elodin is a very gifted Namer, and that he probably has the chops to pull something if it needed to be done - and the wisdom to know when and where it needed to happen.

This is after his frustration with trying to open the chest.

 My theory is that, along with the arranged fight where he says ""I almost forgot who I was"", he was not saying he forgot he was a innkeeper, but the opposite. He forgot he was Kvothe the Arcane, thus leading to him being defeated in the fight.

The Aeolian mode of a musical major scale is a different way to play a scale.  You play the same notes of the scale, you just start at a different note up or down the scale.  Needless to say, Aeolian and Eolian sound pretty similar.

The Aeolian mode of a scale moves the start of the scale up to the sixth note in that scale.  Coincidentally, this is also the mode that is called a Relative Minor; It changes the scale from a major (happy, bright sound) into a minor scale (a sad scale).  Maybe something happens at the Eolian that changes Kvothe for the worse, and puts him on track to becoming Kote, the mopey fall out?

I think all the stuff about Kote's inability to use sympathy or hand to hand combat are completely and plainly wrong. What is probably closer to the truth is Bast's speech about how people become their mask: Kvothe's apparent ineptitude is from his own self-defeating mind state. We've seen him act like the guy in the stories when he's mad.

Kvothe restrained Bast from attacking Chronicler. Bast later revealed a dark bruise on his wrist where Kvothe grabbed him.

Kvothe *started* beating the two muggers. Then he let them beat him, laughing hysterically on the floor. Obviously he thought it was better to lose some money/teeth than to reveal and/or become his old self.

When Chronicler pissed Kvothe off, Kvothe shattered a glass bottle on his counter using sympathy.

Finally, the constantly overlooked example of Kvothe's ability to revert to his old self is his dealings with the Scrael. He kept a piece of the first one they found. I've never seen anyone on here mention that he did that, and that using a part to represent the whole is a sympathetic principle. Plus, then he fought off five of them.

1367008095.0,41,self.KingkillerChronicle,1d6cxb,A few things I cam across on a re-read of Name of the Wind,44,3,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/KingkillerChronicle/comments/1d6cxb/a_few_things_i_cam_across_on_a_reread_of_name_of/,"I keep coming across little details made I couldn't have been aware of the first time around. They all struck me and so I wrote them here to see if anyone had any thoughts on them.   


&gt;""'Things are too full of life in the spring months. In the summer, they're too strong and won't let go. Autumn...’ ” He looked around at the changing leaves on the trees.” ‘Autumn’s the time. In autumn **everything is tired and ready to die**.’ ”  


I thought this was a pretty straightforward admission by Kvothe about his life. ""Too full of life"" in the Spring to die, ""too strong and won't let go"" in the Summer to die, but here he is in the Autumn, tired and waiting to die.  
  

&gt;He looked down at his hands, one curled inside the other, resting in his lap. After a moment, he lifted and spread them, as if warming them by the fire. They were graceful, with long, delicate fingers. He watched them intently, as if expecting them to do something on their own. Then he lowered them to his lap, one hand lightly cupping the other, and returned to watching the fire. Expressionless, motionless, **he sat until there was nothing left but grey ash and dully glowing coals**.


So, over on Tor, it's been suggested that something has happened to Kvothe's hands because they are mentioned so often throughout both books. But what struck me here is that our 3rd person narrator says ""until there was nothing left but gray ash and dully glowing coals."" It may be a little foreshadowing about how his Chandrian hunt may become an obsession for Kvothe and he loses himself in it. 


Then, later, the narrator's like, 


&gt; The flare of flame revealed them all briefly, old wounds and new. All the scars were smooth and silver **except one**.


And I remember a lot of Kvothe's old scars never really leaving traces behind aside from the silver lines. Sounds like he's been punctured rather violently at some point we don't know about. 


Later, after Kvothe kills the scraelings, Bast sings a song while Kvothe sleeps,  


&gt;“How odd to watch a mortal kindle
Then to dwindle day by day.
Knowing their bright souls are tinder
And the wind’ will have its way.
**Would I could my own fire lend.**
What does your flickering portend?”


At first I thought this was just Bast being sad that Kvothe is mortal. While I still think it confirms that Kvothe is mortal and not Chandrian or any of those other theories, I now think Bast may actually be giving Kvothe some fire. I presume this because of the weird magic Bast did in D2 when he switched mouths with Kvothe after he got beaten up by those soldiers. Maybe he can do that with some sort of life essence, too. 


&gt;“Devan. Devan Lochees.”
Kote stopped polishing the bar and looked up. “**Lochees? Are you related to Duke...”** Kote trailed off, nodding to himself.


I totally missed this my first read-through. DUH. Chronicler is a Lockless relative. 


Take a look at Chronicler's reaction to Kvothe's prodding:


&gt;Kote nodded, still expressionless. “I might have guessed he would be the first to find me. Rumormongers, both of you.” Chronicler’s smile grew sour, and he swallowed the first words that came to his lips. He struggled for a moment to recapture his calm demeanor.


Ha. Maybe Kvothe's short temper is a Lockless trait. Meluan is surely familiar with it!

1352410421.0,41,self.KingkillerChronicle,12vm8h,My Elodin Theory (WMF Spoilers Maybe),50,9,34,http://www.reddit.com/r/KingkillerChronicle/comments/12vm8h/my_elodin_theory_wmf_spoilers_maybe/,"I put a lot of this in some comments in [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/KingkillerChronicle/comments/12ud5g/question_of_spades/).

I don't really have anything to back this up with. It's all speculation, and it's fun to think about stuff like this.

The question of why Elodin would use his admissions question to tease Kvothe about playing cards poorly, with the same question Manet used got me thinking.

Having a bad night playing cards seems like a pretty insignificant occurrence. It seems unlikely that Manet, Wil, or Sim would ever tell anyone, let alone one of the masters, about it. So how does Elodin know?

I'm thinking Elodin and Manet are one and the same. Some things to think on:

* Elodin obviously knows something about changing one's own name. His reaction when Kvothe asks him about it speaks for itself.

* Elodin is constantly urging his naming students to shed logic in order to see.

* I can't recall ever seeing Manet and Elodin in the same place at the same time. (Please correct me if I'm wrong about this)

What if Elodin, in the pursuit of becoming a better namer, changed or split his name to alter his mental characteristics? He chooses and changes his name on a regular basis, but is unable to make the two whole again. When he removed his logical self, he went ""mad,"" but it became incredibly easy for him to know and see names.

The other masters are all smart. They wouldn't have thrown Elodin in the special cell in the crockery if they thought he'd be able to get out. After they put him there, he came to know the name of stone, and was able to escape.

When he changed his name to be Manet, he regained his logic. Logic seems to be a key trait for being a good artificer. Could there some advanced sygaldry that could change one's appearance? It's hinted that Manet knows things waay above the E'lir level. 

Elodin is constantly late to things never (minus giving Fela her ring) wears his Master's Robes. Everyone seems to attribute it to his oddness, but could it be because he is always coming from somewhere else as Manet? 

The other Masters would of course, know. Why else would Manet be allowed to spend so much time as an E'lir, but learn advanced material? Whenever Kvothe is raised to Re'lar, he isn't given the opportunity to accept or decline. It just happens.

If this is the case and the Masters did know, I think Dal would have told Elodin about suggesting Kvothe skip admissions beforehand. When K told everyone over drinks about having dinner with Dal, Manet didn't skip a beat. He then gave K the logical argument as to why: He wouldn't be able to afford it. Then, as he's leaving, Elodin takes the chance to encourage Kvothe to truly chase the wind while he's away. 

So that's my take.",,False,self,t5_2smxb,False,,,True,t3_12vm8h,http://www.reddit.com/r/KingkillerChronicle/comments/12vm8h/my_elodin_theory_wmf_spoilers_maybe/,

1364176123.0,40,self.KingkillerChronicle,1ay59h,My thoughts on Denna and the Chandrian,50,10,48,http://www.reddit.com/r/KingkillerChronicle/comments/1ay59h/my_thoughts_on_denna_and_the_chandrian/,"Alright, this might end up being kind of long.

As JWrundle pointed out, the signs are listed: Blue Flame, Rust, Cold/Black Eyes, Rot, Mute, Blight (presumably failed crops, not rotting wood), and Haliax's Shadows.  That makes only six Chandrian w/o Haliax, guessing the last sign is still rabies, because kvothe gets told by the girl 'a man getting bitten by a dog'.

Secondly about the Chandrian, im certain that they are ex-emperors from the time of the Amyr empire.  In the second book, toward the end of Chapter 14, Kvothe mentions a book that states this.  He disregards it out of hand, but really it makes a lot of sense.  Haliax was forged in a time of turmoil and war right?  And many empires had fallen, it fits.  Further, its a counterpoint to the seven angels created by Aleph/Tehlu.

Ahhh, guess Mr ash and cinder arent the same.  It is logical, but perhaps too much so.  Common answer is Bredon = Mr.Ash.

Haliax tells Cinder that he is but a tool in his hand, or some such.  My best guess at the 'plan' of the Chandrian is to complete Haliax's revenge on the world.  He went mad at the loss of Lyra and destroyed Myr Tariniel.

Lastly, The Chandrian must be connected to the waystones somehow.  In the Children's chant it mentions ""Stand alone, Standing stone"".  No idea what theyre going to be used for, but my guess is that they become important.

Now, its pretty obvious that Denna is pretty wicked.  Some of the peculiar things ive noticed are as follows:

She can speak in the Adem hand-sign-language.  It mentions her making and odd fidgeting motion when talking to kvothe, where he notices her missing ring.  Also what really makes me think this is in Rothfuss's phrasing.  He repeats a lot of phrases in his writing between different characters.  When Kvothe first meets one of the Adem, he notices 'an odd fidgeting with his hands'.  Its mentioned a couple times being done by Denna after she gets a compliment from Kvothe, so it would make sense there.  And then Kvothe notices the ring gone, so i dont think it was her habit of messing with her ring; thats just what he notices gone.

She can do the Knot-tying language

""Its my job to notice things about you""

Denna is old.  Really old.  I think she may be related to the 'Singers' (on account of her voice), or perhaps one of the angels: ""Fair Geisa, who had a hundred suitors in Belen before the walls fell. The first woman to know the unasked-for touch of man."" fits her pretty well.  Especially with her complaining about men all having the same 'playbook' and whatnot.  Or, she may be a spy for Haliax, hard to say if shes on the good side or the bad from the first two books.  There is the problem of their meeting though.  Denna seems pretty genuinely lost in purpose, just scraping by.  Its shown too much to be just a cover.  My best explanation is that shes a sort of 'sleeper agent' and the peculiarities are just subconscious, of perhaps if she is a spy for Haliax, she got possessed after meeting Kvothe.  (Again, why not start watching him while he was in Tarbean?  Why wait?)

Edit 1: Kvothe:  No huge revelations other that whats obvious, he fucked up and is depressed.  Just that Kote means disaster.  Its from something Kilvin said, only picked it up the second time through.  In fact, Rothfuss's phrasing ""The man who called himself Kote"" *The man who called himself Disaster* is pretty damn clever

One of the themes of WMF is that the lines aren't some black and white and the Amyr aren't necessarily storybook heroes. (Duke of Gebea) Their creed is ""for greater good"" and using a poor girl merely looking for a sponsor in an almost experimental way that in all probability will get her killed seems suitably fitting for what we know of them. 

Perhaps the Amyr are actually what started Arliden searching for that story as well. Experiment 1 - traveling troupe, song about chandrian; dead.

After re-reading The Name of the Wind and The Wise Man's Fear a good few times, I was wondering about something concerning Kote's Box.
It has been a widespread believe that Kote's Box is similar to the Box which Jax used to capture the Moon - and on some other source (I believe in a Story around Tamborlin the great) mentioned that such a Box would have 3 layers, something like Steel, Glass and Copper.

When Kote asks Bast how he would open the Box and Bast Fails at it he leaves the room, and Kote gets out 2 Keys he had hidden outside of his window. He still doesn't manage to open the Box because he lacks 1 key.

Now I read the first book over and over and came to the part when he first meets Auri.
Auri has a strange air about herself anyway, since Kvothe came up with her Name on a hunch (he thought it was a Siaru Translation, which, as Elodin told him, was wrong.) 
The important part is that the first present Auri ever gives Kvothe to their Meetings is a key - and when he asks her ""What does it unlock?"" she answers ""The Moon"".

At the early stage of the book this looked like just some cute nonsense we get used to from Auri, but looking back at it, maybe it is not.

[Spoilers]",40,7,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/KingkillerChronicle/comments/1ecqzj/regarding_denna_see_a_woman_pale_as_snow_silent/,"I'm re-reading the series (yet again) now, and I've just come upon the start of the climax of NotW.  

Right when Kvothe realizes that the decaying wood and rusted metal at the Mauthen farm means that the Chandrian have been there, he and Denna recite this little verse together.  Let me give it to you in context a bit.  They had been discussing the blue flame, and Kvothe had just pointed out how everything that was new at the farm was decaying:  

&gt;""What do you think happened?""  

&gt;She looked at me for a long moment before responding.  ""Something bad.  I've never seen a demon, and I don't ever expect to.  But I've never seen the King of Vint either...""  

&gt;""Do you know that children's song?"" Denna looked at me blankly, so I sang:  

&gt;*""When the hearthfire turns to blue,  
What to do? What to do?   
Run outside. Run and hide.""*  

&gt;*""When your bright sword turns to rust?   
Who to trust? Who to trust?    
Stand alone. Standing stone""*

&gt;Denna grew paler as she realized what I was implying.  She nodded and chanted the chorus softly to herself: 

&gt;*See a woman pale as snow?    
Silent come and silent go.  
What's their plan? What's their plan?    
Chandrian.  Chandrian.*

Now, I'm aware that the implication that Denna may be a Chandrian has been discussed and over-discussed, but I want to draw your attention to a few things here.  I would like to start off by saying that I do *not* think that Denna is a Chandrian.  I think that there is little to no chance that she is one.  However, I do believe that she has something to do with them, and not just via connection to Master Ash (who many believe to be Cinder).  

First, pay attention to the fact that Kvothe begins by citing the relevant passages of the song.  They had been discussing blue flame and rusted water pumps, then Denna interjects with a verse describing a pale woman coming and going silently.  It is certainly possible that Denna finished the song to make the implication of the Chandrian clear, but I believe that the verse she sings is left there for the reader.  

Denna is described as being ""pale as the moon.""  We are all well aware of the fact that she tends to come and go with little or no warning.  She fits into the first two lines that she sings in the same way the moon fits into the sky.  Those lines absolutely define some of the key attributes of Denna.  

It is my opinion that Denna, wittingly or not, is some sort of harbinger of the Chandrian, or of major events unfolding around the Chandrian.  Like the blue flame is (seemingly) Cinder's sign, or like the shadow-hame is Haliax's sign, somehow Denna herself is a sign of the Chandrian.

Let me know what you think.  Sorry this was such a lengthy post.  

TL;DR: Denna is a sign of the Chandrian, and may be inextricably connected with their plan, whether she knows it or not.

1366789199.0,36,self.KingkillerChronicle,1czxag,Bredon theory. A Beutiful Game. Spoilers both.,44,8,47,http://www.reddit.com/r/KingkillerChronicle/comments/1czxag/bredon_theory_a_beutiful_game_spoilers_both/,"Alright. I'm on another reread of the books and I'm reading through the part when Kvothe is in Severen and hanging out with Bredon.

I'm gonna start off from the start. We all know there is the theory that Bredon may be Cinder. I'm building off that. So to start: When K first meets Bredon, he describes him as dressed in ""ash"" cold and ""dark coal."" This right here is a good give away that it's Cinder, as ""cinder"" is likened to ash and coal. 

Another thing that catches my eye is that in their first meeting, Bredon says something like ""oh yes. I will enjoy **playing with you.**"" At this point in the book within context it is lead to mean ""playing"" as in the game tak and/or court gossip, but from another point of view (if you consider Bredon as Cinder) he is talking about maneuvering Kvothe or altering his path in a similar way that the Cthae is, or just talking about foiling his plans because he knows or has an idea about what he is to become (as I believe Skarpi did when he called out his name in Tarbean.)

This is not my main point tonight, though. Tonight I want to talk about the ""beutiful game"" bit. This has always caused me pause when reading the books. When reading again this time I thought of something I hadn't previously. Before I get into that, I just want to point out a few spots of mystery:

*  Bredon has a staff that has a *silver* wolfs head. I can't find any relation to that. If you do, please tell me.


*  Bredon seems to make a point of not giving his rank while making it seem like it is in K's best interest, as in ""oh what ring should you use when you call on me? Well since I haven't given you my rank and I don't know yours, we should both just use iron since that's equal status"" blah blah. Bredon could have sent a ring to him requesting presence. I believe his excuse to ""give an old man a dramatic entrance"" is really just an excuse to not give whatever rank/social standing to Kvothe.


*  Bredon has a staff/walking stick just like Master Ash.


kv*  Bredon is rumored to be seen participating in ""pagan rituals"" on the outskirts of town (I personally believe this is him travelling between the wastone (maybe the same one K and Denna sit at when she plays her song for him) or communicating with the other Chandrian)


Anyway, again I am digressing.

**My real point here tonight:**

Chapter 67 in WMF, page 446.

This is when Bredon beats K several more times at Tak and K thinks he is getting close to winning. Bredon gets angry and shows him how he isn't even *close* to beating him. And I quote:

""You've been going easy on me.""

""No,"" Bredon said with a grim look. ""That is far gone from the point I am trying to make.""

""What then?""

""I am trying to make you understand the game,"" he said. ""The entire game, not just fiddling about with **stones**. The point is not to play as tight as you can. The point is to be bold. To be dangerous. Be elegant.""

Here's where it gets good now:
'
*He tapped the board with two fingers.* ""Any man that's half awake can spot a trap that's laid for him. But to stride in boldly with a plan to turn it on its ear, that is a marvelous thing."" He smiled without any of the grimness leaving his face. ""To set a trap and know someone will come in wary, ready with a trick of their own, then beat them. That is twice marvelous.""

Okay. This is what struck me. The whole setting a trap and knowing someone will come in wary and still beating them. Supposing Bredon is in fact Cinder, do you think it's possible that the whole bandit camp raid was actually a trap for Kvothe? Maybe just to.. I dunno, confirm that Kvothe was what they think he was or something? Think about it. Bredon talks about setting a trap with someone coming in wary and then beating them. Then, Kvothe finds the bandits (presumably Bredon/Cinder knew that the Maer would send him or even influenced that decision) and he goes in wary, but it's just a trap. Not a trap to catch him, but to spot him/find him out. Cinder literally sees that Kvothe is there and takes the fuck off.

So my question to you is do you think Cinder (one of the most cruel if not the most cruel of the Chandrian) is considering this playing a beutiful game and having a fun way of ""playing with"" Kvothe (see above, Bredon literally said he'd ""have fun playing with you"") and is playing with him much as he is playing a beutiful game of tak?

Let me know your thoughts. Thanks guys.

Edit: the reason I bolded ""stones"" is because I thought it was interesting that he may be inadvertently referring to waystones/doors of stone and fiddling arond with them, which is hilarious because he wouldn't want him fiddling with them because it may lead to his demise.

Edit 2: I was quite drunk when I wrote this last night, so I'm sorry if it's a bit rambly.

(long),42,6,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/KingkillerChronicle/comments/vir8u/two_characters_i_think_are_members_of_the_amyr/,"I apologize if these are old theories, but here are my thoughts. I could be very wrong. 


Loren is Amyr.  When Kvothe is talking to Simmon in Tomes and showing him the book of physiology from the duke who killed all those people, he puts out a theory that the Amyr still exist, and they are still working on their goals whilst actively concealing their existence. 

1- If you try to remove yourself from history, then the library at the University is a logical place to put one of your members. 

2- There are the agents of the archives who go out and hunt for books. They meet one in the waiting room.  The gentleman out to chase down books is armed and has the look of an adventurer rather than a scholar. I get that roads are dangerous, but the book collector is painted as glamorous, and Kvothe takes note of him. And just the way they mentioned the maps and all of the effort that went into tracking books, it just seemed like overkill for book buying, but perhaps suitable it was suitable for tracking specific books and recovering/eliminating them. This could be an extended function of the Amyr's goals to hide themselves.

3- Loren keeps Kvothe out of the library for a year, or plans to until Elodin intervenes.  He also straight up discourages him from researching the Chandrian and the Amyr. It is under the guise of not keeping Kvothe from  appearing childish, but why would the head of the Archives go to a brand new student just to spare him some teasing from other students? That's two instances where Loren seems eager to keep Kvothe away from finding out more about the Amyr. And twice where the action is above and beyond what one might expect.  

4- Loren is renowned for having a hell of a poker face. Or rather being emotionless. If you want someone to infiltrate the university as an Amyr and stay secretive you would need someone who is a tremendous actor and who is always in control of their emotions. 

5- Loren just seems very calm and calculating. He is the kind of person who would view the world the way an Amyr does. A utilitarian and orderly system where the greatest good is served even if that involves some nasty stuff. 

6- I also suspect Puppet knows some things about the Amyr, and I would wager that is part of why he is allowed to live in the archives with fire. I think Loren either keeps him there for close tabs because A) he knows what he shouldn't or B) because he is either working for (perhaps unknowingly?), or a member of,  the Amyr. 

None of these by themselves really mean much, and some of them I know are shaky. But does anyone else just get the feeling that Loren is Amyr?


The second member is Bredon. Regardless of wether or not he is Master Ash as well, and I suspect that he is. 

1- The Cthaeh tells Kvothe that the Maer has come close to the Amyr though he doesn't know it. He also tells Kvothe that staying close to Alveron will bring him to the Amyr, so someone close to the Maer is likely Amyr. The Cthaeh even laughs at this point, which to me seems like it knows something Kvothe doesn't. Perhaps it's that Kvothe has already met an Amyr as well and doesn't know it. The Cthaeh laughs at the thought of Kvothe being shocked when he discovers he has already met Amyr. 

2- Sure, the Amyr the Cthaeh mentions could have been a passerby Alveron met elsewhere, but I think it makes sense for an organization like the Amyr to have someone placed in strategic places (like the University Archives), and the Maer's court is certainly important enough. 

3- More importantly, the Maer has caught the interest of the Amyr for the same reasons Kvothe has: he has gone looking for them. He tells Kvothe he made a bit of a search of it when he was young, and he has always been curious about them. If someone with the Maer's resources is close to finding the Amyr, it makes sense to have an Amyr close by to swoop in when he gets a lead and get their first to keep it secret from him and the world. 

4- Bredon is keeping tabs on Alveron for the reasons above. Kvothe wanders in as a bonus, so Bredon takes an interest in him as well because he is important in that he is a young, rising magical talent who just so happens to be hell bent on tracking the Amyr down.

--- He comes to play Tak, and he never reveals his station in the court. Pat goes out of his way to mention that Kvothe was confused about where Bredon stood, and Kvothe never seems to find out where he stands in the rankings. In the Maer's court with all of the gossip going around, especially with Kvothe searching stories for his ""book,"" he still doesn't get a handle on where Bredon ranks, so he is probably not from an old family or an established part of the court. I am guessing he is wealthy and from elsewhere. Someone would have to be pretty influential or talented to maintain secrecy or this kind of artful hide-in-plain sight trick in this situation. How does someone as smart and as inquisitive as Kvothe get stymied by trying to find out the station of Bredon?  

---If you are trying to get the measure of someone, Tak is a great way.  Bredon/the Amyr will likely want to either recruit or silence Kvothe. He is going to become an enemy or an ally, and either way it is important to understand how he thinks. Think of Grand Admiral Thrawn in the Heir to the Empire books.(Star Wars expanded universe for those who don't know) he would win battles because he understood the art of the people he was fighting, and that insight allowed him to beat them. Bredon is playing Tak to learn Kvothe's style, temperament and personality. 

--This approach reeks of a beautiful game. Sure Bredon could have Kvothe killed or pushed off the path easily, but he wants to set up a masterpiece and push the dominoes. So he learns about Kvothe by playing Tak with him. 

---He is keeping his eye on Denna. If he is indeed Master Ash. I think he plays with Denna solely as a way to influence and learn more about Kvothe.  He beats her because it will drive her to Kvothe all the more readily. She has value for the control she exerts over K--she is a lever attached directly to his rudder. Or maybe Ash/Bredon is after her because she is the moon (as some suggest.) We also know Denna is important in the scheme of things because she is one of the things the Cthaeh chooses to focus on. Remember, Kvothe has tremendous potential to influence the world because of his power and fame, so the Cthaeh would push the most volatile buttons he could. Bast talks about a person meeting the Cthaeh, and Kvothe says it's being shot like an arrow into the future, but Bast says it is more dangerous because an arrow only hits one person, and the Cthaeh wants to hurt everyone. Remember, the Cthaeh is described as totally malevolent, so he will want to hurt the world as much as possible. Kvothe blames himself for the worsening of the world. We don't know all of the details, but we know he feels responsible. Which subjects set Kvothe off? The Chandrian, the Amyr and Denna.  

I see Bredon as a spider in the center of a web. When it comes to keeping the Amyr secret who could be a greater threat than two curious people, one of whom is rich and powerful as Alveron is and one of whom is brilliant, a hell of an arcanist, stubborn and used to traveling far and wide? It makes sense for an Amyr to be keeping tabs on both of them.  It's even possible that Caudecus was poisoning Alveron as part of this. perhaps to keep him from being well enough to pursue the Amyr but healthy enough to be useful to the Amyr's pursposes. K may have stopped them, or perhaps it was set up as a way of getting Kvothe into Alveron's good graces. That one's shaky at best, but I'm throwing it out there.

It also seems like Elodin believes that he is kind of responsible for her, which is could be why Elodin hasn't told anybody else about her. I also believe that it's likely that Auri knows the name of fire (the incident that caused her to go insane might of been an accident that was her doing that involved learning names, but who knows), because during the whole bone tar incident in the first book, some of the stuff leaked down to the underthing where she's living, and from what the book says the stuff is incredibly dangerous stuff as it is basically hydrochloric acid that creates a lot of fire, and it kind of struck me as odd that she came out completely unscathed, so i'm guessing that she may have called the fire and extinguished it. She also talks about names quite a bit. Maybe in the third book Kvothe will end up learning the name of fire from her. Just something that i wanted to get out there.

My theory is that Cthae isn't really evil, it's just kind of pretending to be.
There are a few things that kind of bug me about Cthae being evil

1. What would cause it to be evil? I believe that any flaw in character that causes someone to be evil can be fixed in some way, so any flaw that motivates Cthae to do evil can, and so very probably is, fixed in some conceivable future, which Cthae sees at the very start of its existence, and thus is not evil.

2. Cthae is very close to being omniscient, so it can probably understand the motivations of most people extremely well, and I believe that when you truly understand an immoral person, you tend to pity them more often than hate them.

3. Many great namers talked to it an took its advice. This includes Jax, who Selitos believes to be his equal. I find it hard to believe that a great namer can talk to a purely malevolent being and not notice its malevolence (especially a namer that managed to steal the moon).

4. The Sithe keep it sequestered from the rest of the world. Now, if I were a malevolent omniscient tree who has dedicated my whole existence to ending the world, I would appear benevolent and friendly, and attempt to have as much contact with the world as possible, only to end it all at once, before anyone realizes what is happening. It's a bit unlikely that there was no point in Cthae's existence when it could have persuaded everyone that it was in fact benevolent. 

5. It seems to dislike the Chandrian, who probably aren't exactly a force of good.

6. Assuming any great namer ever came to it who any possible future had their own name discovered (by themselves or someone else) why didn't Cthae simply enslave them and directly influence the world?


All these things combined lead me to believe that Cthae actually has a plan that has been going on for a while now, and is probably going to take a few more thousands of years, but it will end with a Utopia.

This is my attempt at combining all of the stories into a cohesive narrative. Recently finished a re-read and this is a stream of consciousness tinfoil hat theory about the nature of the Four Corners.

Long ago Aleph began to discover the names of all things. Aleph was the first to do so and soon became very powerful in his knowledge. He was arrogant in his power and began create many things with his power. Other saw this and discovered that they too could find the names of things and bend them to their wills. The most powerful of these Namers were Aleph, Selitos, Lyra, and Iax. As more and more individuals found their power and the desire to create things a new landscape came into being and was called the Fae.

As the most powerful Namer, Aleph held himself apart and others came from across the land to learn from him. His greatest student often challenged his ideas and the way he manipulated the world to his will, and the way more and more were changing the world. One day the student challenged Aleph, the situation escalated and ended in her death.

After this, Aleph’s use of the power changed completely. He no longer used his power to manipulate the world and impose his will upon it, but rather sought to understand the world. He sought out the other Namers who shared his new idea, these included Selitos and Lyra. Iax however refused to stop his manipulation of the world and many flocked to his banner. The Namers collectively sought to prevent a conflict. The Namers came to realize that their creations did not grow, change, or change as did things from the natural world. Some of these creations had absorbed the intentions and emotions of their creators in a primal and imperfect way as the understanding of the creators were also imperfect. What resulted in some instances were innocent enough, trees with extraordinary properties. Some were possessed of an all consuming lust. Others manifested a pure and utter malevolence as the intent of their creators was to poison and reduce the creations of others.

The Namers resolved to divide the Shaped lands from the natural world and in the faen realm the Shapers were free to exercise their will. This arrangement lasted until Iax pulled the moon partially into the Fae realm. After this tragic event the war began in earnest. The Shapers created armies of monstrosities that poured out of the Fae and wreaked havoc on the people of the world.

In that time there were 7 great cities and Myr Tariniel, the greatest city of all. The leaders of these cities were great Namers and the greatest of these was Selitos, the leader of Myr Tariniel. Many people without the power of Naming took up arms to defend their world; some followed a philosophy of martial arts and were renowned warriors. To fight the Fae creatures, Namers used their skill to create weapons of enduring quality for the warriors.

The greatest of these warriors was named Lanre, who was the love of Lyra. For years and decades the war raged. The Shapers could create endless hordes of creatures and humanity was pushed back to the cities. During this time a man named Tehlu looked upon the suffering surrounding him and took up a hammer to drive the monsters from the land. Tehlu understood the name and nature of iron, and iron granted him its power to bind and drive out the creatures. Tehlu prized justice above all, and the creations possessing and killing the people, and their wretchedness as a result of a lifetime of cruelty were abhorrent to him. He sought out the Shapers and Knowers responsible for the cruelty inflicted upon the world. The Knowers were unwilling or unable to destroy Iax and so commissioned traps that they might seal him away forever.

Tehlu continued his crusade to free the people of the world traveling to each of the cities, saving the possessed and bringing his harsh justice to the cruelty of the world. Eventually Tehlu learned that Iax had begun the conflict after stealing the moon and sought to bring Iax to justice. Tehlu found Iax at a massive battle and sought to bind him. The Knowers took this opportunity to capture Iax and seal him in their trap. However during the battle Lanre was slain and Lyra consumed with grief raised him from the dead, but in doing so shortened her own life. As Lyra drifted toward death, Lanre heard of a flower in the Fae that could cure anything. He traveled there and was told of a power he could use to revive Lyra.

Here is where I ran out of developed ideas. He somehow became Iax through changing his name, or at least a combination of the two souls. He couldn’t revive Lyra because that would have to undo the change that Lyra made and Iax wasn’t as powerful.

Tehlu became a folk hero.

The Six leaders of the fallen cities joined Lanre/Iax. They went to Selitos for help but he condemned them. The Fae realized they may be destroyed and worked to destroy the creatures of the war. They learned the nature of the Cthaeh and sought to end all influence in the world. These fae warriors became the Sithe.

The last city, whose leader did not follow Lanre hid the city somehow and after a time began teaching people about naming. Lanre and Selitos had their confrontation above Myr Tariniel, im not discounting that Denna’s version isn’t at least partially true somehow. After the fall of Myr Tariniel, Aleph emerged from his hermitage to put a final end to the conflict. He removed much of the power of naming from the world and changed the nature of the world and its people. Much of this power was invested in Tehlu and his followers but removed them from the world.

Selitos founded the Amyr bent on avenging the deeds done by Lanre and the Six. Ferula somehow pissed off the Cthaeh, possibly revealing his role in the conflict and beginning the quarantine by the Sithe. With Iax at least partially bound in Lanre, the Doors, and changed by the power of Selitos, Lyra dead, and Selitos himself stripped of much power, Aleph removed himself from the world taking with him much of the power of naming, in the hopes that nothing like the Creation War would happen again. With Tehlu removed from the world, some people began to worship him and started a religion.",,False,self,t5_2smxb,1364347067.0,,,True,t3_1b2ud4,http://www.reddit.com/r/KingkillerChronicle/comments/1b2ud4/the_creation_war_spoilers_heresy_and_rampant/,

Kvothe raised an eyebrow. “It isn’t one of your kind?” Bast’s normally affable expression sharpened into a glare. “It was not ‘my kind,’” he said indignantly. “The Mael doesn’t even share a border with us. It’s as far away as anywhere can be in the Fae.” Kvothe nodded a hint of an apology. “I just assumed you knew what it was. You didn’t hesitate to attack it.” “All snakes bite, Reshi. I don’t need their names to know they’re dangerous. I recognized it as being from the Mael. That was enough.”

WMF:
&gt; Bast went very still. “What did I do, Reshi?” “You stopped that creature from the Mael,” Kote said. “Oh.” Bast relaxed, making a dismissive gesture. “I just slowed it down, Reshi. That’s all.”

&gt; Felurian was more than willing to talk about the Fae realm itself. And many of her stories detailed the fractious politics of the faen courts: the Tain Mael, the Daendan, the Gorse Court.  

and

&gt; Felurian left similar details out of her stories. Who wouldn’t know, for example, that the Gorse Court had meddled in the Berentaltha between the Mael and the House of Fine?

It seems as if ""the Mael"" is part of the fae, and that may be further divided into pieces: the Tain Mael, potentially the Telwyth Mael. But if that's the case, what does Bast have to do with it? ""It doesn't even share a border with us"" he says.

(Spoilers All),43,9,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/KingkillerChronicle/comments/1i70jv/every_seven_years_spoilers_all/,"So Kilvin's ""*Chaen Vaen edan Kote*"" , meaning""Expect disaster every seven years"" gets a fair bit of attention for very possibly being related to Kvothe's name change. 

A recent (somewhat redundant) post about this got me thinking though. What if the ""seven years"" part of the saying is as important as the *Kote* bit? What if disaster does actually strike every seven years? We already know the number Seven bears major significance. The obvious touchstone, to me, would be the murder of Kvothe's troupe. And I'm really not sure about the timing of the books but with around six months in the forest, three years in Tarbaen, and now he's been enrolled in the University for about two and a half(??) years, with some of that time spent in Vintas and Ademre. That's a really rough guess but I'm pretty certain it's been less than seven years, but not by much, meaning we will probably get to that point in The Doors of Stone. 

The imminent disaster could be any number of terrible things that are theorized to be the ""tragedy"" that seems to be coming. But I also wonder if it could mean the Chandrian strike in full force every seven years (I'm not sure that all of them were at Trebon). The more alluring thing to me is if you combine the Aturan and Siaru versions of the phrase, you get ""Expect Kote every seven years"". Maybe Kvothe/Kote will have spent seven years at the Waystone before he gets back in the game, so to speak.

I guess I'm sorting of grasping at straws but I'd never really given much thought to the ""Seven years"" part of Kilvin's saying. 

TL;DR: Lots of tinfoil. Kilvin says we should expect disaster every seven years, maybe he is quite literally correct in that statement. Also, maybe Kvothe/Kote is the disaster that happen every seven years.  

EDIT: Just to clarify something; the fire in the Fishery is completely incidental to this hypothesis, I don't think that fire itself has any significance to the ""seven years"" thing. Basically I think that maybe the Chandrian will strike, or some other huge disaster will happen to Kvothe seven years after the massacre of the troupe (which is the only event in the 'main' storyline that we know included all seven Chandrian).

There were no bright scratches skittering along its dull grey side. But though it was unmarred, **it was old**. And while it was obviously a sword,… **It was slender and graceful**. It was deadly as a sharp stone beneath swift water. Its grey-white metal shone against the dark roah behind it. While the handle could be seen, it was dark enough to be almost indistinguishable from the wood. The word beneath it, black against blackness, seemed to reproach: Folly.”

When Kvothe comes face to face with Cinder after his family is murdered:

""**His sword was pale and elegant**. When it moved, it cut the air with a brittle sound. It reminded me of the quiet that settles on the coldest days in winter when it hurts to breathe and everything is still…
Except his eyes. They were black like a goat’s but with no iris. **His eyes were like his sword, and neither one reflected the light of the fire or the setting sun**.”

If the full story of his exploits becomes known, then his friends might also be at risk. Kvothe wouldn't take that kind of chance. There are two ways to think about this: either his friends are all dead (depressing, but certainly possible), or else Kvothe might be taking steps to conceal their identities.

We only know the last names of three people in the Kingkiller Chronicles: The Maer Alveron, Meluan Lackless, and Ambrose Jakis. They are all people that Kvothe has a grudge against, to one degree or another.

There are people who are easily identified: the Masters at the University, who are all public figures, or people like Manet, Deoch, and Stanchion, who were never involved in any scheme of Kvothe's.

Then there are Kvothe's friends, every one of whom has been implicated in wrongdoing to one degree or another: Denna, Sim, Wil, Fela, Mola, and Devi. Simmon, at least, must have a last name, since he is the son of a noble. But for every one, Kvothe hasn't really given Chronicler any personal identifying information. Denna changes her name at the drop of a hat. Sim is the son of an Aturan noble, which is common enough at the University; we have a few details about his father's duchy, but nothing that Kvothe couldn't have altered without affecting his story. Wil is the son of Cealdish merchants; not particularly informative. Fela is a pretty Modegan woman. Mola works in the Medica. Devi's probably a little more identifiable, but she's used to operating on the shady side of things and quite able to take care of herself.

While someone determined enough could go to the University, ask questions, and identify everyone based on finding out who was friendly with Kvothe while he was there, this would require a great deal of effort. Someone Kvothe pissed off in Vintas or Atur wouldn't be able to read Chronicler's story and go, ""Ahh, Kvothe was friends with Willem McWoolmerchant and Fela O'Calculus! I shall have my revenge upon them!""

I just re-read Wise Man's Fear and I noticed something that is either pretty cool, or just reading too much into it.  Toward the end of the book after meeting the Ctheah, Bast rants about how evil the Ctheah is and how every time it appears in stories it means everything is going to go wrong in the end.  He says something like ""we put a tree in the backdrop of our plays so everyone knows what kind of play it's going to be and everything is going to go wrong in the end"".  

Anyway, I just noticed that the cover of the first book is a tree even though all the tree stuff (Ctheah, lightning striking the tree, finding out the meaning of Maedre) occurs in WMF.

I am brand new to reddit and am probably doing this wrong.  But I will go for it, since I am itching to swap theories.  

I apologize if this has already been addressed (It would be great if you could point me to a link!).  

My theory is that Kvothe has a significant amount of Fae blood.  To my mind, this is the only reasonable explanation for his violently red hair (which is not from either of his parents, and that doesn't make any sense at all unless he has some 'demon blood' in him, especially given that these are fairly science-heavy fantasy books), his eyes changing color to reflect his emotions (The only other characters this happens to are Felurian and Bast), and the fact that he heals very quickly.  Plus, it could possibly explain his physical and mental prowess?  I would suggest that one of his parents was Fae (see Arliden's comment to Laurien in NotW that she must have bedded down with a wandering God), but then I don't see where his Edema Ruh features would have come from.  I find the Cthaeh's comment that his mother held up to Cinder's torture much better than his father interesting in this context, too ... does it imply his mother was part Fae and therefore more capable of withstanding torture?

If Kvothe is part Fae, he could have impregnated Felurian.  Since time passes differently in Fae, Bast could easily be related to him.  So he could be his grandson (seeing as Remmen is Bast's father, that possibility is out).  However, I think it is more likely that Bast is his grandfather (e.g., Laurien's father).  I know the theory they are related is not new, but I haven't seen much speculation on the extent to which Kvothe really is ""a little fae around the edges"" so I thought I'd see what others think about this.

A) What does he look like?

Do we ever get a clear description of the Chronicler?  Is he fat?  Skinny?  Young?  Old?  What color is his hair?  His eyes?

We can infer that he doesn't look extraordinary from the way other people treat him, but we, the readers, are given no information beyond that.

B) How old is the Chronicler?

This question plays into the first one, and is what makes me think of Kvothe's comments about the Amyr- this is a significant absence.

The Chronicler has written Oren Veliciter's biography- and Oren Veliciter has so many and such old stories and songs about him that Denna considers writing one more to be a cliche that will never make her name.  The Chronicler wrote the Mating Habits of the Common Draccus, a book common enough to be in Devi's personal library and to have multiple editions- at the time Kvothe was new to the University, putting it at least 30 years before the frame.

The Chronicler was at the least a Re'lar of the University, but pointedly doesn't mention the names of any of the faculty that could put him in a particular time- instead referring to the Master Namer by title only.

The Chronicler has gone so long by his title, that he blanks for a moment when asked what his proper name is.  That is a long, long time.

Despite this, the Chronicler gets none of the narrative tags that 
imply great age.  He is able to walk for multiple days in a row, eating out of his pockets, with no more hardship than painful feet.  He gets clobbered in the head, but Kvothe expresses no particular concern that might be expected for an elderly man having been dealt a comparable blow.

C) He knows Skarpi.

The Chronicler has some kind of relationship with Skarpi- mentorship or colleagues or what have you.  Given that Skarpi is someone unusal, that weirdness bleeds.

D) In spite of all this, he is curiously ignorant.

He doesn't know anything about the Fae.  He doesn't know anything about the scrael.  He doesn't believe in demons.  These things blow away the normal happy answers to mysterious figures in the Knigkiller Chronciles, as they imply he's not a secret Amyr, or Sithe, or Singer, or Angel or what have you.

I'm going through Wise Man's Fear again, and I've just gotten to the part where Kvothe is eavesdropping on Denna and the girl that she saves from being raped.  

It is fairly obvious (and outright stated by Denna) that the girl's story mirrors her own. At some point, the girl must have made a reference to a play called *The Tenpenny King*, because Denna responds:   

&gt; ""*The Tenpenny King*?"" Denna interrupted incredulously. Her tone more venomous than anything I'd ever heard from her before. ""Kist and crayle, I hate that Goddamn play. Modegan faerie-story. The world doesn't work like that.  

&gt; ""But..."" the girl began.  

&gt; Denna cut her off. ""There's no young prince out there, dressed in rags and waiting to save you. Even if there were, where would you be? You'd be like a dog he found in the gutter. He'd own you. After he took you home, who would save you from him?

Here's something that I never really considered before: Kvothe is Denna's ""young prince dressed in rags"".  He doesn't know it, of course, but we are almost 100% confident that he is a Lackless (at this point it'd be more surprising if he weren't Natalia Lackless' son).  

Obviously this explains in part why Denna is the way she is--but it's amusing that she hates the story, and thinks that it's ridiculous, and that the world doesn't work like that, but she is more or less living it out.  At least, she's living a more realistic version of it.

**edit**
The plot thickens---when they have their argument after she plays her Lanre song for him, she says:

1340326245.0,33,self.KingkillerChronicle,vetkf,"My self indulgent thread of theories. Some have been mentioned before. The others that I think are original probably have, too. Plus lots of supporting evidence for the Auri-is-the-moon theory.",34,1,46,http://www.reddit.com/r/KingkillerChronicle/comments/vetkf/my_self_indulgent_thread_of_theories_some_have/,"WARNING: most quotes are paraphrased. I'm not going to the effort to dig through a combined 1700 pages to make sure everything is word-for-word. The reason you guys are subscribed/browsing this sub is because you think these books are awesome and have likely read them more than once. I'll have faith in your knowing what I'm talking about.

I'll lead with my theory that I think is least likely to have been mentioned in here before: I think Kvothe unknowingly used grammarie when he made that ""charm"" for the little girl from Trebon. She had nightmares about the Chandrian, but they never came for her, so far as we know. Their second meeting had to have occured--what--six months after their first? That's more than enough time for the laziest bad guys to pick a date and kill one defenseless little girl. There's also the fact that Kvothe mentions how that was the first time he ever really felt like a hero.

____________________

Auri. I think she's the moon. I know a lot of people think it's Denna. A few think it's Auri; I hope to expand on this. And by hope I mean I hope these ideas have not already been brought up, making me look pretty stupid. I get that Denna comes and goes like the phases of the moon and appears not to have a name. However, Auri is just as conspicuously dispossessed of an actual name that was not given to her by Kvothe, and she was so excited when he 'gave her a new one.' 

More important and more compelling are the circumstances surrounding Elodin's decision to take Kvothe on as a student. In the admissions interview Elodin asks an absurdly easy question and then, provoked by the scoffs of the other masters, says ""What? Should I ask him something only a namer would know? Fine. Where does the moon go when it is not in the sky."" Kvothe of course has no idea how to answer.

The next time Kvothe and Elodin meet is on the rooftops with Auri. Pat is a cunning writer, and he's subtle about it, but as far as I have seen the moon is always absent when Auri is present. Mr. Rothfuss snuck it into this scene by having Auri fetch dinnerware. When she goes into the underthing, Kvothe is able to see Elodin's expression because the moon peaks out from behind a cloud. This is -- significantly -- the same scene where Elodin decides to take Kvothe under his wing. I think the temporal sequence and the content of these two meetings is strongly suggestive.

By way of further evidence, there's the scene where she first calls Kvothe (hereinafter referred to as 'K'. Seriously, this is such a clumsy word to type repeatedly. Pat must have had it on clipboard) a Ciridae. This time I'll directly quote the book.

*I heard the faint, drumlike sound as a piece of tin roofing bent behind me. I stiffened, then relaxed as I heard Auri's voice, ""Kvothe?""*

*I looked to my right and saw her small shape standing a dozen feet away. The clouds were hiding the moon, but I could hear a smile in her voice  as she said, ""I saw you running across the tops of things.""*

All this happens *just* as a storm is sweeping in over K's head. So it's not unreasonable to assume that the clouds had been hiding the moon for a very short period of time -- say, after K had already been on the roofs for a while. Where I'm going with this is her word choice. ""I saw you running across the tops of things."" I understand that she lives underground, so we accept that she peculiarly refers to the oustide world as 'on top of things', but that sentence sounds conspicuously like what someone with a bird's eye view would say. Or, the moon, if you will. Think about it.

Finally, Jax trapped part of the moon inside the folding house right? If some of you are not familiar with this theory, some other redditors have posited that Mains is the folding house. Aside from the fact that this conveniently fits right in with my theory, as Auri inhabits a hole beneath Mains, it also explains why there would ever be a building so dreadfully designed. After all, Jax didn't know how to use the folding house and all sorts of pieces ended up in the wrong places. This segues smoothly into my next, much less thoroughly supported theory.

___________________

I think that, aside from the name similarities, Haliax is tied to Jax/Iax by their connection to the moon, evidenced in the drawing given to K by the little girl from Trebon. Above Haliax's likeness was a picture of the moon in different phases. This one is less of a theory and more of a wild guess. Whatever.

___________________________

Staying within the parameters of ""less a theory than a groundless guess"" I suspect Lanre/Haliax (Jax?) is actually a good guy. Evidently the rest of the Chandrian are sadistic assholes, but he doesn't seem to like them very much; he just has control of them. He makes it very clear that Cinder is just a tool in his hand, i.e.: they're not buddies. The Chandrian also appear to be afraid, which is not typical of an epic fantasy Big Bad. If this were the case, it would raise the question of why they must kill people for talking about them. It's a fair counter point. But if they're so scared of the ""Singers, the Sithe, the Amyr,"" then it stands to reason that they need to take extreme measures sometimes. 

Frankly the Amyr are just as scary as the Chandrian, and have just as much history of violence against the helpless.Then there's the song Denna made, portraying Lanre as a tragic hero. But I've seen that theory discussed too much, and I havent gotten to that part yet in my reread of Wise Man's Fear.

So this is just cobbled together from theories that other people have had, but I haven't seen any discussion on it.

It's is generally accepted that the Lackless sister is Kvothe's mother. Evidence: ""Not tally a lot less""

The line of sucession recognizes heirs from the mother's side and Kvothe is ahead of Ambrose. Evidence: ""Actually [Ambrose is] sixteenth in the peerage,"" Sim said matter-of-factly. ""You've got the royal family, the prince regents, Maer Alveron, Duchess Samista, Aculeus and Meluan Lackless. . .."" He trailed off under 
Manet's glare. 

If Kvothe wasn't a bastard he would be ahead of Ambrose.

Some more facts. Kvothe kills a king. Kvothe fakes his own death very convincingly and becomes someone else.

So the tin hat theory is that Kvothe is the king that Kvothe kills.

Facts that throw a monkey wrench into this theory: Kvothe's a bastard and has done nothing so far that could make people want to crown him king.

Maybe he brings destruction down on the world somehow. (Kote can be translated as Disaster, and his sword is Folly.) Then he does the best he can to stop what he caused but he fails. People see him as their last hope, not knowing he caused it to begin with.

* Animation

A cartoon (I hesitate with the word, given juvenile connotations) would solve many problems associated with a KKC TV show; getting the right 'look', finding actors with the expressiveness and musical ability the books demand, finding and funding locations that could represent the Four Corners, forking out for special effects budgets (Game of Thrones' multi-million dollar budget barely managed THREE dragons!).

Not only does it solve problems, it introduces new opportunities.  Mr. Rothfuss's writing has created a world that is both rich and stylised, which could be shown with cunning use of art-styles.  The books contain stories within stories within stories, how better to illustrate this than with subtly different use of colour and line?  Imagine the jump between frame and tale, going from a vibrant world of saturated colour to a grayed inn in the middle of Newarre filled with pastel shades.  Imagine Kote showing flashes of anger, colour returning to him with the darkening of his eyes.  Imagine watching the re-telling of Aethe's story, a polished narrative handed down through the centuries shown as a tapestryesque pseudo-montage.

A cartoon also widens casting possibilities beyond those who look right.  [My favourite suggested so far?](/s ""  Jeremy Irons as the C'Thaeh."")

In past comments I've theorized how I believe Kvothe is actively pitting his Alar against himself.  Effectively changing his name and everything about him.  I came up with this when I came across the section where he was playing ""hide the stone"" in his own mind.  
Well I believe this action has to be a conscious action done by at least part of Kvothe's mind. 
The two times we see Kote become Kvothe he went to bed first.  The first time was when he went out to lure the skrailings.  PR does a good job of explaining that Kote locks up early, skips the sweeping and goes to ""bed"".  Next we see him out in the woods killing skrail.  Something that Bast feels should have made him dead twice over.
The second time is when he takes the ""perfect step"" in the epilogue.  ""and it was in the hands of the man who wore the bruises as he rose stiffly from his bed, ...""
I also remember Kote saying that he doesn't sleep much anymore, but I don't remember where, so I can't reference it.

I have not seen any reason in the text to believe that it does not have a name, but it is undeniable that it doest have some sort of magical property unknown to us. It is mentioned many times in the text and made obvious for close readers that copper is special in some way.

Just a few of those mentions are:

-Taborlin the great has a copper blade named Skyaldrin
-The Four Plate door is locked, and it has a lock, four keyholes, in the four copper plates
-The copper door in Elodin’s cell &gt; later copper mesh added to walls after he escapes once
-Elodin destroys the stone around the copper mesh, but not the copper
-Copper is used for the sygaldry in Ambrose's window and Anker's fridge
-When K is examining the Loeclos box, he says that he thinks the wood must have a lot of metal in it like roah wood does, and from the wood's color, he guesses iron and copper

A theory (yes another one) of what copper does, but sadly not the all wanting question of WHY. My theory stems from this quote said by Elodin

He slouched onto the couch. “You see, once upon a time Elodin the Great found himself locked in a high tower.” He gestured to the room around us. “He had been stripped of his tools: his coin, key, and candle. Furthermore, his cell had no door worth mentioning. No window that could be breached.” He made dismissive gestures at each of these. “Even the name of the wind was hidden from him by the clever machinations of his captors.”

Pat has been known to put stuff like this out in the open before, subtly of course, but still there nonetheless. “Even the name of the wind was hidden from him by the clever machinations of his captors.” It could very well be possible that copper hides the names of all things from namers, or that it simply hides the name of the wind. Odd that copper would hide the name of the wind, but no more odd than copper not having a name at all. I personally hope copper is somewhat of a red hearing. It is not special in any other way other than the fact it is used in sygaldry and is a sign of sygaldry. Which of course could very well be used to repress powers of naming or otherwise iie? But we will have to wait for D3 like everything else. OH WELL IT IS ALWAYS FUN TO SPECULATE.

Luten = 1st day of the span  
Tehlu = the greatest angel (or Tehlin's God)  
Ludis = moon's name  
Lute = Ruh's favoured instrument (well, at least Illien's). And interestingly, the word 'Lutist' is very close to 'Ludis'... I wonder if that is just a coincidence/oversight by Pat (I don't think so, given that Jax beguiled the moon using music in Hespe's story). And how interesting that Lute is basically Tehlu in different order!  

  
  
. . . . . . .  
  



Denna's names are always Di- something, like following Diana (the goddess of the moon). But once in Severen, her name is Alora. And I'm pretty sure Alora = Aloine + Lyra. But why would Denna name herself that? (Also, lyre = harp, aloine = anagram of eolian = wind)  

In Ch. 69 of WMF, Denna's approach to music is described as ""...she moved through the city like some faerie creature. She walked roads no one else could see, and it made her music wild and strange and free."" Significantly, Kvothe later describes (multiple times too) Felurian's laugh as wild, her voice as strange and her hands as free. I think this, as well as ""roads no one else could see"" and the faerie reference strongly suggests that Denna has been to the fae.  

  
. . . . . . .  
  
  

The word ""mend"" comes a lot with tinkers. That and the fact that the tinker was given the job of ""mending"" the broken house at the end of the broken road in Hespe's story, I think tinkers might be how the Tehlin church got the gospel of Menda (tinkers = menders) - to oppose the idea that tinkers might have something faerie (demonic) in them while making themselves look good. This makes me think that tinkers, the fae and the Lethani (which is the correct path, or road) is all connected somehow. Finally, after Kvothe's first performance at the Eolian, Count Threpe says “...he doesn’t know he can’t save the end of a broken song with a broken lute. But you did!” This is extremely similar to the wording/phrase in Hespe's story about the broken house and the broken road. How does music come into all of this? (It must somehow, given the Adem vs Edema Ruh connection)

Kvothe poisons the stew **before** he gets to meet the kidnapped girls(I guess he does it when he goes to taste it before the others). Also he says he'll join them ""Until no one objects to my leaving.” This means he already planned to kill them.

So what would have happened if it turned out they didn't have any kidnapped girls and were decent people? They pretended to be Ruh but they just took the wagons when the original troupers were killed. That's a bit bad but it's *understable*.

Some quotes:

&gt;“So you killed them for pretending to be Edema Ruh?”
&gt;“For pretending to be Ruh? No.” I put the iron back in the fire. “For killing a Ruh troupe and stealing
&gt;their wagons? Yes. For what they did to you? Yes.”

Althought there's a slight contradiction later on, when one of them tells him that he was an adopted Ruh and they had the wagons because someone else killed the original troupers.

&gt;even though I’d already known. There was no
other way these people could have come by a pair of Edema wagons with their markings intact.

So seems like he killed them for the kidnapping, but he did the set up before he even got to know about it.

So my question is.. what would have happened if they were nice people pretending to be Ruh? Everyone's poisoned, they'll get questioned by Kvothe and will object to him leaving the troupe. And hurting them to let him go seems wrong.

Of course he could just say:

&gt;Ok I made the wrong conclusion sorry for the poisoning guys, so... stop pretending to be Ruh, and I'm going to have to break the ""Until no one objects to my leaving.” condition, kthxbye.

Although I understand this is a book, just found it curious.

**Edit**: Ok made a mistake, for some reason thought the Ruh pretenders weren't the guys who killed the real ones.

By the way the man refers to Kvothe's victim as only ""him"", I assume he is talking about the King that Kvothe killed, or at least another famous murder.

I bet that the man Kvothe killed is Ambrose, due to a few small factors:

* Imre is very close to the University, so Kvothe was probably still attending the University, meaning he was still fighting with Ambrose
* Ambrose and Kvothe already had a confrontation at the fountain in one of the books (one of the first times he called the wind)

It is also, clearly, very very old. According to Elodin, long ago the University was a much smaller thing - more profound, perhaps, but smaller. This suggests to me that the Underthing has origins that have nothing to do with the University, and that it pretty clearly was there before the University was.

What if the University is built upon the ruins of an ancient city? Say, one of the cities destroyed in Skarpi's story? Or one of the cities destroyed by Encanis in Trapis's story? (might be the same stories, if they originated from a common event per Arliden's blue-eyed grandchildren analogy). This might be connected to Auri's still-unexplained knowledge of the Amyr, as well.

Myr Tariniel is the obvious candidate if we're looking at a specific city, though this does have the problem of Imre and the University not being surrounded by mountains. The other obvious possibility is that it's the remains of the city that wasn't destroyed.

Here in the frame, Kvothe was just robbed and beaten by the two soldiers. We learn later that Bast is the one that hired the soldiers, hoping to coax Kvothe into fighting.  

Now, enough people have already pored over some of the more obvious arguments in this scene for Kvothe having thrown the fight (i.e., when he says ""I almost forgot who I was"", the fact that he was beating them, but suddenly started losing, and the fact that he was laughing as they were kicking him).  

My (hopefully new) argument will hopefully add to these.  All that we know about what Kvothe has become comes from Bast's interactions with Chronicler.  He asserts that Kvothe is becoming an innkeeper, and losing himself. 

What I think is interesting is that right when the story pauses, and Kvothe sends Bast on his way to the wake, Kvothe explains to Chronicler that the reason he stopped was that Bast couldn't feel something just half-way.  

To me, this sounds like an excellent explanation as to why Bast thinks that Kvothe has become the inkeeper--he acts like it, and he does it so well that he's convinced Bast, who can't feel something just half-way.

[Spoilers],28,1,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/KingkillerChronicle/comments/1jox3s/military_arcanists_spoilers/,"Well, it seems to me that Sympathy is ridiculously powerful. Kvothe alone nearly killed an entire 20+ person bandit encampment. Even if most Arcanists aren't quite as powerful as he is, they are a huge asset in combat power. Combined with Sygaldry and Alchemy, I think Arcanists would be highly sought after by the military. And we're not even talking about Names yet.

If you can get three or four skilled Sympathists together, I bet even a Chandrian could not stand up to their Alar assuming they could find a link. In fact Sympathy even has some aspects that Naming can not do. A Sympathist doesn't even need to be near his target to attack him. We've already seen traps that employ Sygaldry, too. Naming, on the other hand, probably requires you to at least know where your target is.

But we have yet to hear of any combat Arcanists. Even the heroes from stories are more namers than arcanists. I actually thought, while reading, that Adem mercenaries would use some form of martial Sympathy. Of course it turned out to simply be regular martial arts. 

Vintas might not employ any Arcanists since they are said to be highly superstitious. But other countries like the Commonwealth, home to the University, must surely value the art. To be fair, we haven't actually seen any military in the story yet...only guards, bandits, and mercenaries. Do you think we will get to meet any fighting Arcanists in book 3? I seems pretty logical.

How does Skarpi know Kvothe's name?

When Skarpi meets Kvothe, he has been AWOL for around 2 years? You would have to be really interested in Kvothe to keep tabs on him for that long. And even then, how would you trace him through the wilderness and in a city as large as Tarbean. 

So all things considered, we need

1. Interest to be developed in Kvothe
2. Someone who knows Kvothe in Tarbean
3. Skarpi

The only person who has reason enough for 1 is Abenthy, the only person who satisfies 2 is Trapis, and 3 is well, Skarpi, who has to know both of them to be able to set Kvothe back on his original path of revenge and greatness. All of this seems suggest that Trapis too, is not who he seems to be, and a member of some group to which the other two belong (Amyr, angels etc). This group has to have a reasonable amount of influence if Skarpi is so utterly unperturbed on being caught by the Tehlin guards. In a state that is at least partly a theocracy, you have to be someone special to just brush aside what could potentially be blasphemy.

The next logical question is, why are these powerful, well-connected people trying to manipulate Kvothe? Does this series too contain a prophecy that Kvothe is a part of? Are the Lackless rhymes different forms of this prophecy? I am drifting further and further away from my original post, so I'll leave it at this. What do you think?

Or perhaps, it was the nearest small settlement he came upon after finding the box, and he decided to lay low there while attempting to open it.  We do know that Kvothe is in possession of a box that he is unable to unlock, so if we take this to be the Lackless box, it really seems to fit together rather nicely.  What do you guys think?

Don't read unless you're finished with WMF. Sorry if this has been discussed elsewhere, I just stumbled onto this subreddit and I'm thrilled to find you all.

The Adem's lives, everything they do, revolves around the Lethani. *It's a path, but it's not a path.* Their teachings abound with lessons of the deeper meaning that everything possesses. *Is Sheyhen's hat beautiful? What makes something beautiful?*

My first read through, I simply took everything at face value. They're warriors, they have a kind of code they live by, and Kvothe is an outsider that just barely proves he's worth teaching. They have decidedly unusual sexual practices. Then I got to the part about ""man-mothers,"" scratched my head, and moved on.

But my subsequent read-throughs helped me to understand the depth of what Rothfuss was trying to convey as I read the chapters Kvothe spends with the Adem. The subtlety. The ""Spinning Leaf"" mind state that Kvothe probably wouldn't have taught himself or needed anywhere else. The infallible Lethani.

And then I came to the part about ""man-mothers"" again. **Man Mothers.** Even with their combat prowess, beautifully subtle language, strange and interesting sexual practices, and the unquestionability of the Lethani, Rothfuss incorporates a hysterical ineptitude when it comes to even the most basic understanding of the function a man and a woman serve in the creation of a child. Why?

Why would Rothfuss have added a part that any reader would identify as idiocy into a segment of the book that described characters that seemed so unmarred?

I really only have two guesses, and in my opinion they're both probably shit.

The first is the most obvious, and that is that Rothfuss needed to work in a sliver of imperfection into the Adem, otherwise it would just seem like he was gushing over them for too long.

My second guess is also just that, a guess. But if you take into consideration their unusual sexual practices, it almost makes me wonder if there really isn't something greater at work that just the typical man+woman=baby sequence that's accepted as fact in the rest of the four corners. Like there are powers outside of the world of man at work... whatever they may be.

I believe this for three reasons:

1. Kvothe is becoming ""too"" close with Herma while learning Yllish under him; Hemme may take this as a power-move on Kvothe's part. 
2. Hemme knows that he is the most appropriate choice for Chancellor; Arwyl, Kilvin and Elodin are not suitable for various reasons. 
3. Herma has publicly berated Hemme multiple times for speaking out of turn and such; hurts Hemme's pride. 

These reasons (and more if you can think of any) imply that Hemme has a lot of reasons to poison Herma. 

A problem with this theory is that you'd think distinguished Arcanists would be able to notice poison (Arwyl himself) quickly.

Part of the reasoning behind the assumption is that this story in many ways is about Kvothe's hunt for the chandrian. 
--The true beginning of the story is when is parents are killed.  From that point of view, much of the rest of the story could be seen as Kvothe gaining the skill and information he needs in order to enact his revenge. 
This notion is supported by the fact that the chandrian (especially cinder) keep on popping up around many of the stories' climaxes.
--I also think that master Ash (denna's patron) is probably Cinder (for a lot of reasons, but not least of all that it's Kvothe who comes up with the name Ash, a synonym for cinder, and Kvothe has shown that he is good at naming things according to their nature, even when he doesn't realize it himself). This would just redouble Kvothe's hatred of the chandrian because Ash is so terrible to Denna and seems to be getting worse as we go on.

Recall that in chapter 2 of tWMF Kvothe tried to persuade the young boy Aaron not to enlist by revealing his true identity (or at least the name by which Kote became famous).
The boy obviously didn't bielieve Kote, and started singing some lines abut the fact that ""Kvothe wore rings on all his fingers"". Here I quote:

&gt; On his first hand he wore rings of stone, 
&gt; Iron, amber, wood, and bone.
&gt; There were rings unseen on his second hand.
&gt; One was blood in a flowing band.
&gt; One of air all whisper thin,
&gt; And the ring of ice had a flaw within.
&gt; Full faintly shone the ring of flame, 
&gt; and the final ring was without name.

Now, we know the story about the wooden ring (which was given by Meluan) and the ring made of bone (which was given by Stapes). We know also what inspired the ring of air (some joke between Knothe and Elodin). But what about the others?

1. The ring of iron is probably related to the fact that Kvothe has learned the name of the iron, which makes him ""one of perhaps two score people in the world"" to know it. I point out the fact that when the Chronicler used the binding of iron against Bast he told the Chronicler to undo it ""or I will break it"".
For you was it only a bluff, or maybe the bartender recalls more than it seems?

2. The ring of stone probably has something to do with Fela, who knew that name when Kvothe was a Re'lar. I think that maybe that ring is some sort of Fela's last present to Kvothe, given maybe during a disaster in which Kvothe couldn't save Fela another time. That would explain the strange reaction of the drunken pilgrim -maybe Sim- when he recognized Kvothe in book 1.
I stress the fact that, even if drunken, the pilgrim could have said ""I'm Sim"" instead of ""I heard you one time..."". I know that just would be bad for Rothfuss, but the actual version makes Sim pretty silly, didn't it?

3. The ring of blood is quite interesting. I think that it would be great if Kvothe made a ring with HIS blood -perhaps the same drops that gave to Devi as warranty-.

4. ""The ring of ice has a flaw within"": has anybody ever thought to Denna's ring, which was made by a blue stone and which was never repaired since she gave it to Ambrose?

5. ""And the final ring was without name."" Here no speculation is possible, but why mention an unnamed ring in a story? Its power should be great...

6. ""There were rings unseen"" leads to the final question: where are all those rings now?

And you, what do you think about all that?

From Wise Man's Fears, Chapter 146, Failures: 

""All ownership was oddly dual: as if the Chancellor owned his socks, but at the same time the socks somehow also gained ownership of the Chancellor. This altered the use of both words in complex grammatical ways. **As if the simple act of owning socks somehow fundamentally changed the nature of a person.**""

Relevant portion bolded. 

Now, this could simply be grammatical silliness, but it could also be indicative of how they view the world and the objects in them.

This places an interesting highlight on Auri's conversations and the objects she gives to Kvothe. Also on the fact that she won't accept second hand clothing from anybody. But aside from that...

What fascinated me was in Skarpi's story of Drossen Tor, Lanre dies killing '*a great black beast with scales of black iron, whose breath was a darkness that smothered men*'.

The next time we see Lanre is in Myr Tariniel during the betrayal:

""He came alone, wearing his silver sword and **haubergeon of black iron scales. His armor fit him closely as a second skin of shadow. He had wrought it from the carcass of the beast he had killed at Drossen Tor.**""

He created a set of armor from the beast that killed him. I don't know what significance that might hold, but depending on the nature of the beast (if it wasn't simply a Draccus) it's possible that this dual ownership had powerful consequences. I also find it interesting how similarly the beast is described in Skarpi's story to how Encanis is described by Trapis (*Encanis, whose face was all in shadow. Encanis, whose voice was like a knife in the minds of men*). Encanis could easily be a demon that Lanre killed, but by wearing it's skin became it? Just a thought.

It could also have large implications for Kvothe, who is in possession of a sword that is not originally his. If it belongs to Haliax or one of the Chandrian, just think of the effects dual ownership could have on him (leaving the possibility that he needs to cast away the sword or something else).",,False,self,t5_2smxb,1345565036.0,,amyr,True,t3_yammw,http://www.reddit.com/r/KingkillerChronicle/comments/yammw/philosophical_musings_on_yllish_dual_ownership/,

It seems to be building up to a big climax, but I also feel like a huge part of the story the Kvothe is telling is the knowledge of how it ends (I believe that was actually mentioned at some point in the second book somewhere).

Kvothe's Dad always used to joke about how he ""Stole away"" his mom from a family of wealth.

Meluan is all butthurt towards the Edema Ruh because *her sister ran away with them.*

(Spoilers All),27,6,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/KingkillerChronicle/comments/1c9z0g/where_are_the_amyr_speculation_spoilers_all/,"Okay I have a few ideas I'm feeling pretty good about. I haven't gotten it all sorted out yet, but I'm certain I'm on the right track in some respects.

Here's my idea.

Aleph turned some of the Ruach into Angels of a sort and they can only punish what they themselves witness from that day forward. Selitos refuses saying, ""I cannot forget"" suggesting maybe the angels will forget what they know. The Amyr are formed and named in honor of the city suggesting that the Amyr are few, and I believe they are close to immortal though I can't recall if that's based on specific evidence or simply inferred.

Tehlu, who ""holds justice foremost in his heart"" accepts. At some point later he appears to Meriel, impregnates her with himself and is born as Menda. Menda matures and learns quickly. In his fight with the demon Encanis he says he will be reborn.

If he is reborn it would likely have some of the same circumstances as with Menda. A virgin birth. Accelerated learning and maturing. A mission to bring justice. Persuit of ""Demons""... Familiar enough? Kvothe's mother DOES make mention of being visited in the night by someone with red hair who isn't Kvothe's ""father""... Maybe that's a bit far off, but maybe not? Who besides our hero? Tehlu is Menda is Taberlin is Illien is Kvothe?

Not only that, but there are 6 other ""Angels"" running around with Tehlu being the greatest. Who else do we know that learns somewhat like Kvothe does? The Angels sang songs of power. Who else with a musical bent? Denna fits this bill perfectly. Which of them she is I could only guess to be the one who had a huge number of suitors in her city before it was destroyed. Is this romance a continuation of one that preceded the creation of the Angels and the Amyr?

I also think Devi is a solid candidate for another of the Angels, but I'm not entirely convinced yet.

Scarpi knows only one story that unfolds everywhere... Does he know everything that's ever happened? While being arrested he started to say ""Tehlu always said..."" Was he intending to tell something he heard Tehlu say personally? Scarpi is of the Amyr, who refused to forget in exchange for the power to punish Haliax.

The similarity of the story of Selitos to the story of Odin is enough for me to want to draw the connection, and where I go with it is maybe a little out there, but humor me... Selitos has to try to stop the terrible things before they happen, and who do we know that reaches out to affect the events of the future besides the Cthaeh? The Cthaeh is presented as a villain, but we know nothing about what would happen if it didn't do what it did, so maybe it is selecting the best posible path ""no matter the cost"" which would certainly fit with the motto of the Amyr. Scarpi, Selitos and the rest of the Amyr have potential allies in their fight in the Angels who are periodically reborn, but if they are born with blank slates they would have to be found and guided and taught and would probably be guided from afar so as to prevent the bad guys from finding them while they are young and vulnerable. And if Denna was found and guided by the wrong people? It also occurs to me as possible that the Sithe are actually the protectors of the Cthaeh, shooting down any threat to it as opposed to executing anyone that talks to it. Kvothe wouldn't have been much of a threat and might have preferred status as an Angel which allowed him to approach.

Also the fact that the Angels sang songs of power makes me want to believe they are the Singers that Haliax is protecting the Chandrian from. This makes sense to me. Is there some connection to the Edema Ruh as a whole? Calling them Singers would certainly distinguish them effectively from the Adem. What if Kvothe, who could play colors to a blind man, is such a threat to the Chandrian because the music might make them FEEL. Maybe that is how he is meant to punish them? As Menda struck with the hammer and made the blacksmith feel regret, maybe Kvothe is to do the same for the Chandrian with his music?

This also suggests to me that Kvothe who is ""beyond reproach"" according to Auri, and the other Angels/Singers are perhaps guided by the Amyr and then named as beyond reproach when they have matured and are ready for the responsibilities they will bear... Are they they Ciridae? Could that be the name for the angels who have learned of their true nature and are on their quest for justice?

Is Kvothe ACTUALLY Sir Savien??

Is Denna ACTUALLY Aloine?

That would be pretty badass...

I have more ideas about the creation of the world by Aleph and the nature of the Creation War and what Haliax is actually trying to do... I'll post them when I have more sorted out, but I will say this... If Selitos banished Haliax and Haliax is in the mortal realm, does that mean that Haliax was banished from the Fae to the mortal realm and that all of the stories of the creation war were stories from in the Fae? Does that mean Haliax tried to steal the moon FROM the Fae and not the other way around?

1) Bast is Kvothe's son (by Felurian?). This is why Bast is so interested in Kvothe's wellbeing.

2) Kvothe returned to Fae already and spent a long period of time there (on the scale of a century) but didn't age and returned shortly after he had left, in the manner of men coming back from Fae. This explains all the references to Kvothe being so old.

3) Ash is Cinder. This one's been talked about so much it's almost not worth putting here, but I'm pretty convinced of it. My favorite proof is how close Kvothe comes to guessing Cinder's true name when speculating about Denna's mysterious patron. Also, Denna is the one who has betrayed Kvothe to the Chandrian.

4) Kvothe killed Sim, possibly under duress from some other situation. He regrets this. See below for a situation in which this might be feasible. Kingkiller might even be an exaggeration of Sim's social rank.

5) The Chandrian possess a victim and act through that person to kill others. I found this theory in Jo Walton's re-read and it almost gave me nightmares. Kvothe killed his troupe after being possess by the Chandrian and manufactured his physical encounter with the Chandrian in his mind. This also might have some bearing on why he killed Sim if, for example, the Chandrian choose to act through Sim when they finally come for Kvothe.

6) Kvothe has changed his name in order to hide from the Chandrian and prevent further attacks on people who grow close to him. The Chandrian have means of finding him based on his Name/identity, so he's had to alter himself fundamentally in order to hide.

Issues under consideration:

1) I see a lot of talk about who the Penitent King is, but I feel that in order to properly answer the question we have to have a clearer idea of who the rebels are. I suspect that the rebels might be somewhat more sympathetic to Kvothe. Perhaps the Maer leads the rebels against Ambrose. Maybe Ambrose leads the rebels against the Maer. I suppose the fact that the king's soldiers are wearing Alveron's colors leads us to suspect the latter case. Either way the current king is dead and Kvothe has been blamed for it.

There is something w don't know about Haliax - maybe a moral ambiguity about the Creation War that is as yet undiscovered. Is Selitos evil - are the Amyr evil? Maybe everyone is just flat out evil.

The ""king"" who is being referred to is actually the Maer Alveron. Now, let me explain.

Here is what is known:

-The Maer is the only king that Kvothe has had contact with, more then that the two are quite well acquainted. Although they parted on less than friendly terms, I think that in the right situation Kvothe could easily con his way into the kings rooms the way he (almost) did in WMF. *Thats gives us the means*

-Kvothe has several quarrels and disputes to settle with the Maer/Lackless. *that gives us (assuming some sort of escalation) motive*

Essentially all I am saying, is that as it stands - the Maer is the only king that Kvothe *could* kill. He has both the means (skills, and access to the Maer if he really wanted), and the motive (dispute with the Maer or his wife) 

Just some speculation.

Heres what I personally think, which is also solely speculation, and possibly complete nonsense. 


I think that some time will go by and the Maer or Lackless will somehow get the mystery box open, whatever is inside will be incredibly important and significant to Kvothes pursuits.Perhaps they get the box open by chance, but I think it might be due to some manipulation done by the hand of Bredon, who I think has some vested interest in Kvothe (some are suggesting that he is a Amyr or Chandrain) 


Perhaps being further pushed by Bredon, or by the Maer; Meluan sends some sort of message or taunt to Kvothe, in an attempt to put him in a state of agony. Little does she know the effect/importance this has on Kvothe, and he stops at nothing in order to acquire this new piece of intel. 

If the Maer were to die as a result of all this, it would certainly explain the current war going on. The Maer is viewed as exceptionally important, with an excess of money and power. If suddenly there were no one to assume this role (assuming that the Maer has not had a child, and that Meluan also died), a state of war would make a great deal of sense in the foreseeable future. 

Kindly let me know why I'm an idiot now. 

**tl:dr: Kvothe has the means, and (potential) motive to kill the Maer. The Maer being dead would explain the current war, assuming that the Maer had not produced a heir**

""There were rings unseen on his second hand.
One was blood in a flowing band.""

Now this one gets me excited; my personal theory is that this is part of the tattoos of the ciridae. Anyone else think so?

""One of air all whisper thin,
And the ring of ice had a flaw within.
Full faintly shone the ring of flame,""

The ring on Air is the wind and the ring of Fire is the fire, both naming rings but how did he get a ring of Ice... along with Amber this completely astounds me.

""and the final ring was without name.""

The best guess I can make is that this is one of the rings of the chandrian which he takes, because this ring is too vague to be open to any real theories.

Who could Master Ash be?  Here are the suspicious facts about him:

-He was at the Wedding, where the Chandrian killed everyone
-He was in the Eolian, where he met Denna
-He keeps total secrecy, has a walking stick, is an 'older gentleman'
-He commissioned a song about Lanre as a tragic hero
-He lives, most likely, in Severen, where the Maer is
-Denna meets him at random times, random places.  No official writ of patronage, no full name.  
-Is a very good dancer, Denna reveals


Speculations:
He's likely, Bredon, which I've seen proposed before.  
-Whenever Denna goes missing from Severen, Kvothe requests a game of Tak from Bredon, and he's always out of town.  
-Bredon is of unknown rank in Severen, and Kvothe never finds out.  
-He plays a 'beautiful game', which, when looking at how he's playing Denna, sounds about right, in a cruel sort of way.  
-Also has a walking stick, has mentioned dancing lessons, and is also 'older'.

He has connections to the Chandrian (if not the Amyr).  Why was he with Denna at the wedding?  Why the tragic song about Lanre?  

If not Master Ash, perhaps he is one the Chandrian themselves, but that has no founding behind it.  I'll edit this once I get to the Cthaeth.

Also, spoilers. Lots of them. Mainly from WMF, but NotW is going to be mentioned, so, stop reading if you don't want to know.

First off, I loved Name of the Wind. Absolutely loved it. It has a special place in my heart because I read it over a weekend while I was sick as a dog and playing Dragon Age like crazy. Needless to say, that weekend is a haze of awesome.

So I was excited when book two came out. I even bought a copy at a book signing, met Rothfuss, and have a picture with him which was awesome. Before I start to sound rambling, I just want to make this preamble to explain how much of a fan I am personally of Pat. 

That said, I really didn't like Wise Man's Fear. For a very specific reason, which is the subject of my debate.

Am I the only one who was immensely let down when the myths of the stories (within the world) started to become too... real? 

In Name of the Wind, I loved how there were a ton of inversions, things that the legends said never seemed to match. You had a lot of interesting villager conversations about Kvothe, and then, as the book unfolded, you realized they were wrong. Dead wrong. You learned how he got his names, and that was cool. The whole premise of ""interview the hero"" seemed based on the idea of ""dispel the sensationalism, and tell the true story.""

Now, I'm not against magic, or any of the supernatural stuff that gets put into a Fantasy novel. I expected a higher fantasy going into this series than, say, A Song of Ice and Fire after all. I loved in Name of the Wind, when you first see the Chandrian, and they're scary as balls.

But WMF seemed too much. Right after coming down from the fight in the woods, Kvothe just... runs off into the wilderness and frolics with elf-maidens. I was like... the fuck? A deus ex sexina just came from no-where. I mean, I expected him to romance and learn from Felurian, it was mentioned a few times, y'know. But I was ready for the inversion. I expected Felurian to be more like a wilds witch or something.

I expected more of the plot to be aversions of fantasy tropes. I expected the mundane. The draccus was. Dragons: the most overtly fantastical element of the genre, and this one was just a big lizard who was only violent because it spent to much time over on r/denner.

Then, after dispelling the myth of Kvothe, and getting a look at the real man. Sex goddess. Ninjas. I don't even think he's much of a Mary Sue; he fails way too often for that. But I was lured in expecting an inversion and now the series is headed in a direction of: ""Nope. Shadow capes. Ancient evil trees.""

I guess in the end, the big problem is, I felt like book one presented an entirely different and somewhat opposite story to book two, and I have no idea how to feel about book three.

During this process I think I have a few more puzzle pieces.

1) Kvothe has never won a game of Tak against Brendon (that I can recall).

2) Brendon states about playing Tak: “Any man that’s half awake can spot a trap that’s laid for him. But to stride in boldly with a plan to turn it on its ear, that is a marvelous thing.  To set a trap and know someone will come in wary, ready with a trick of their own, then beat them. That is twice marvelous.” (p. 446)

3) Kvothe swears to Denna: “I swear I won’t attempt to uncover your patron.  I swear it on my name and my power. I swear it by my good left hand. I swear it by the ever-moving moon.” (p. 490)

Interestingly, Elodin swears a similar oath to Kvothe regarding Auri (p. 110) but that's not why I'm here.

My hunch is Tak is a metaphor for Kvothe's battle against the Chandrian.  He will learn more.  He will get better at finding them and fighting them, but he won't beat them as they will always be playing a more elegant and beautiful game than Kvothe is able to play.

Denna will be the reason Kvothe is without Power and his Name, but the actual undoing will be by his own hand (he'll knowingly break a promise or, Rothfuss forbid, self sacrifice for the only women he has ever loved).",,False,self,t5_2smxb,False,,,True,t3_yld6s,http://www.reddit.com/r/KingkillerChronicle/comments/yld6s/beautiful_tak_and_how_to_lose_your_name_a_wise/,

I have spent the night with Felurian and left with both my sanity and my life. **I was expelled from the University at a younger age than most people are allowed in.** I tread paths by moonlight that others fear to speak of during day. I have talked to Gods, loved women, and written songs that make the minstrels weep.

It is hinted (in his conversation with Bast) that he kept part of the scrael killed at the very beginning of the book.  This seems like a classic setup for major sympathy.  You have a huge heat source, and a good link.  What other explanation is there for such a bon fire, if he was just going to beat them with a piece of iron?

You might thing to yourself ""If he was doing sympathy, he would have come out less hurt.""  You'd be partly right, I think young Kvothe would have fared better.

Possible spoilers ahead. Back? Ok.

Though I don't really ""believe"" it, per se, I think there is some evidence that Kote is really pulling a Verbal on us, with the character of Kvothe as Kaiser Soze. 

We know Kvothe is a real person, is almost certainly the person telling the tale, and has some if not all of the powers and experience his story claims. I'm not questioning that. But whether the events that led to them are as he says, I'm not sure. 

I think a central theme of the story, and a magic we have yet to receive an explanation for, is the one Denna describes:
&gt; What if someone told you they knew a type of magic that did more than that? A magic where you sort of wrote things down, and whatever you wrote became true?” She looked down nervously, her fingers tracing patterns on the tabletop. “Then, if someone saw the writing, even if they couldn’t read it, it would be true for them. They’d think a certain thing, or act a certain way depending on what the writing said.”

In one of his first blog posts, Pat Rothfuss says:
&gt; It’s a story about stories. About how everyone tells stories, but at the same time stories shape our lives.

I've posted before about the possibility that the reason Skarpi knows Kvothe's name in Tarbean is not because he's been keeping an eye on him, or because he speaks his true name, but simply that Kote made a mistake in telling the story. Chronicler would have been paying careful attention to the part of the story that included his colleague Skarpi. He probably knows if and when Skarpi became aware of the existence of Kvothe. It may be that this is the mistake that tips Chronicler off that the story he's recording is a fabrication.

There are numerous themes and ideas in the story that allude to each other - parallels between Taborlin, Elodin, and Kvothe, for example. But there are also very specific re-used elements. The ""how many spades are there"" question is a good one. One of my favorites: when Kote is testing out Chronicler's shorthand writing, he has him write ""I, by signing below, hereby attest to the fact that I can neither read nor write."" The book seller in Tarbean later writes this exact phrase on Kvothe's receipt for Rhetoric and Logic. 

But the most mind-blowing piece of evidence is one I didn't notice myself. I'll just let you read this one.

I'm currently visiting my parents for a few days, so I'm without my books. I apologize if my memory is faulty.

To begin, I'll refer to Kvothe as K for the most part. When a personality change occurs, I'll call K Kote to denote the difference.


* At the beginning of NotW, K fights 5 scrael. Bast's later reaction is that that K was walking into what seemed certain death. Yet, K defeats them. Fast forward to WMF, K initially retaliates against the soldiers, only to be horribly defeated. How could K defeat 5 'mythical' creatures, then fails to 2 soldiers. As pointed out in a few other threads, K remarks that he 'almost forgot who he was for a minute'. Is this K having to retain the image of Kote? Had he defeated the 2 soldiers, he would have needed to actually kill them. Could K have been protecting his image as Kote to spare a few lives? (Yes, this would make the situation with Cobb and crew and the changeling difficult to explain.)

* Sympathy or magic. While failing to perform when the inn is attacked, in NotW a bottle of wine explodes as Chronicler is trying to convince K to tell his story-when Chronicler alludes to Denna. (Chapter 6 perhaps, once again, I'm without my books). What does this mean? (Many people have made reference to Strawberry wine being what exploded, which is what Denna/K seem to drink in most of their intimate gatherings.)

* K's memory is still beyond amazing. He is able to recall conversations, circumstances and everything else perfectly. So well, that Chronicler accuses him [K] of already having prepared his [K] story. This was one of K's biggest advantages in his times at the University. He's beyond his peers in his ability, as mentioned by Sim when finding Elodan's books. This part seems perfect. Yet Kote will act as though he has a faultier memory when he's surrounded by his regulars at the Inn.

So I'm not sure what to make of these. We could say the wine exploding was K's unconscious mind taking control (meaning K's conscious mind is what has lost the ability). Or we could say that it was a slip in K's act when K was confronted by Chronicler (foreshadowing D betraying him or something happening to her).

I don't believe we'll see a fully restored Kvothe in the frame story, but I believe it's all part of his ""plan"".

I've read through a few theories on this sub concerning Denna's patron. The prevailing idea seems to be that it's Cinder. I like the idea, but something in the back of my mind makes me think it's someone else. Ambrose.

Here is why:

- He is violent towards women. I can't remember the exact passage, but I remember Devi mentioning why she hates Ambrose, and she said something about him beating prostitues. He's also very forward and pushy with Fela in the Archives in NotW. We know through Ctaeth and other circumstantial evidence that the patron has been beating Denna.

- When Kvothe travels to Vintas, he mentions that the Jakis family is only a few miles away from him, and Ambrose was visiting his family at the time. Lo and behold, he runs into Denna. When he returns to the University, Denna somehow reappears in Imre. While we don't know for sure that Ambrose is back at the University, I suspect he might have returned after a one-year hiatus as well.

- The patron is very secretive. Ambrose makes it a point to never be directly connected to any of his shenanigans. 

- And finally, Denna's reaction when Kvothe finally gives her back her ring. She doesn't seem to happy about it, and I think it's because she knows she can't risk having it be seen by her patron, Ambrose.

So, what are your thoughts on the matter?

**Edit**: Actually, Ambrose returned  to the university one term after Kvothe. 

&gt; Ambrose had been blessedly absent during the winter term, but when spring arrived he came back to roost like some sort of hateful, migratory bird.

And that's the same chapter when he finds Denna breathless in the church.

**Edit**: And here's the passage where Denna get's her ring back.

&gt; You would think that would have helped. That a gift and clasped hands would make things right between us. But the silence was back now, stronger than before. Thick enough that you could spread it on your bread and eat it. There are some silences that even words cannot drive away. And while Denna was touching my hand, she wasn't holding it. There is a world of difference.

Is it possible that Tehlu himself created the religion?

It's kind of a jerk move, but the whole religion seems to be built out of jerk moves.  Plus, we know Kvothe is supposed to have killed an angel.  If Tehlu is a big enough jerk to create a religion around himself maybe he's a big enough jerk that Kvothe needs to kill him?

Anyway, I don't know if this has been thrown around yet, so here goes nothing:
So I was rereading NotW, and the chapter after the story of Lanre's story (chapter 28) got me wondering about Skarpi.  
It says at the beginning of the book that Skarpi and Kvothe were good friends. Though he's only mentioned in NotW, and to my knowledge, not in WMF.  
  
Some quotes got me thinking:  
Skarpi:  
&gt;""'I suppose that could be true. Tehlu always said-' [skip a line]... 'Oh come now, Erlus.' Skarpi chided as though talking to a small child. 'Tehlu hates you even more than the rest of the world does, which is quite a bit.'""  
  
It's assumed from this quote that Skarpi seems to know Tehlu personally, at least that's what I got out of it.  
  
And then Skarpi to Kvothe:  
&gt;""Skarpi seemed to address the air in front of him.' You should run, Kvothe. There's nothing to be gained by meddling with these sort of men. Head to the rooftops. Stay where they won't see you for a while. I have friends in the church who can help me, but there's nothing you can do here. Go.'""  

The last quote got me thinking the hardest. Mostly because it never actually states in the book that Kvothe ever introduced himself to Skarpi, nor would he ever tell him his current living arrangements. Kvothe had only talked to this man once, and this all happened on the second day of their acquaintance. And ""friends in the church"" is also another big give away, in my opinion. Not to mention he has a far too chilling recollection of Lanre's downfall.  
The way I see it, I believe the 3rd book sees Kvothe go back to Tarbean to seek out Skarpi and something is revealed to us. Because currently, Skarpi seems to be the figure who knows most about the Chandrian that Kvothe has met.  
  
What do you guys think?

I'm sure this has been said before, please link the post if so.

The paralells between jax and the moon and kvothe and denna are staggering. Firstly kvothe\Jax, he comes from a broken home(parents killed), the broken path could be his years wandering aimlessly in tarbean. Both are very single minded in thier pursuit of a goal, both are after a love that  eludes them. Very impatient listeners, kvothe getting pissed with elodan, jax telling the hermit it took too long to learn listening and stomped off to find the moon. Both lost a musical instrument when younger and finally felurian told us jax was imprisoned after the moon incident, kvothe is kind of in a prison at present. Also it's looking like both might have started a war. The folding house\fae is the only place i get stuck on.

As for denna, kvothe has only part of her name as she keeps changing it, she keeps appearing dissapearing, it was via a musical instrument that they first noticed kvothe\jax(ok i know he knew denna a few days before that lute scene).

I'm sure there's others but the redbull is beginning to wear off. it kinda messes me up because there's a lot of paralells between kvothe and denna, both searching for answers\parton, very determined, something bad happened to them earlier in life(doesn't say directly with denna but its hinted at). The folding house\creaton of the fae, is the only jax thing that i can't find a paralell with.

(Spoilers, obviously)",21,0,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/KingkillerChronicle/comments/urhpr/concerning_lackless_her_black_dress_and_the_door/,"Up until minutes ago, I (and, I think, most other people) thought that the 7 things hidden underneath Lady Lackless's black dress, and the 7 things standing before the Lackless door were things that Kvothe will need in order to open that mysterious portal. But what if that's not what they are? What if the 7 things are, in fact, THE CHANDRIAN? 

Think about it: We know ""Chandrian"" means The Seven, it's one of the first, and only, concrete things we ever learn about them (when Kvothe overhears his parents talking with Abenthy about the song they are writing). 

""What's their plan, what's their plan?"" Why do the Chandrian do the things they do? It's pretty much THE mystery, and maybe the answer is that they are guarding knowledge of the Lackless Door. What if there is some intimate connection between the Chandrian and the door, and people who find out about them (like Kvothe's parents and the people at the Mauthen farm in Trebon) are getting too close to knowledge of the door? 

I woke up this morning with this idea in my head, not too sure how it got there, maybe a message from Tehlu and his angels, but ever since I've been trying to match up each of The Chandrian with the things listed in the songs (especially the one about the Lackless door, because it's a more literal list than the other). ""That which comes with sleeping"" could easily be some kind of reference to Haliax, because we know there is some weird shit going on with him and sleep, and if he can never sleep, it makes sense that the door can't be opened. However I haven't been able to match the rest of The Chandrian to the song, mostly because we just know so little about them. 

So yeah, what do you think???

1334033331.0,18,self.KingkillerChronicle,s23af,I think I know what Chronicler's purpose is in this story,19,1,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/KingkillerChronicle/comments/s23af/i_think_i_know_what_chroniclers_purpose_is_in/,"I got some of this from the kingkiller ""Reread"". Spoilers abound, so read at your own risk.

Let me lead up to this a bit with some fun facts:


1. Skarpi ""woke up"" Kvothe from his mind's ""sleep"" - While on the streets, Kvothe shut off a peice of his mind because of the trauma of his parents' murder. Kvothe attributes Skarpi as being the reason why Kvothe woke up from this.
2. Kvothe never told Skarpi his name, yet Skarpi knew it anyway - This was made very clear to the reader. Skapri had no way of knowing Kvothe's name. Skarpi told ""Kvothe"" to run away. That very night, Kvothe's mind started waking up. He remembered his magics, and his reasons for existing were renewed (Go to the university. Avenge his parents). 
3. Skarpi references the 7 - He sarcastically asks the inquisitor that tried to arrest him in the bar if he ""plans on hunting down Heliax and the 7 on his own"". 
4. Skarpi had ""friends in the church"" - When the inquisition tried to arrest Skarpi for Heracy, he was unphased. He was in no danger because of his ""friends"". 


Now, let me throw in just two, small conclusions to the above facts. If you agree that they are a distinct possibility, I can move on to the Chronicler's purpose:

1. Skarpi is an Amyr - He has friends in the church, he was hunting Haliax, and he had inside information about Kvothe (his name).
2. Skarpi is a ""Namer"" - He literally ""woke"" Kvothe up by calling Kvothe's name. He used ""naming"" magic on Kvothe to continue him down his path.

Alright, supposing you can believe those things, consider this:

1. Chronicler and Skarpi are associates
2. Chronicler is an arcanist who knows at least 1 name already (Iron).
3. The way you ""name"" something or someone, is to understand that thing/person completely. 
4. Bast commanded chronicler to snap Kvothe out of his stuper at the Inn.

Ok, here's the theory:

Skarpi awoken Kvothe the first time on the streets as a child because of some plan of the Amyr. Chronicler, an associate of Skarpi, is also an Amyr, and will awaken Kvothe a second time at the Inn!

How will he do this? By understanding Kvothe completely. How will he come to understand who Kvothe truly is, down to the ""Marrow of his bones""? By **Chronicling the life of Kvothe**. 

This whole story he is writing of Kvothe - It's not some book he wants to publish; It's a way to learn Kvothe's true ""name"", so that he can wake him up and fulfill his and Skarpi's purpose.

Are the Amyr really ""good""? Are the Chandrian really ""bad""? The beliefs of the Four Corners inhabitants are too black and white for my tastes at present, and if I were Rothfuss I would do that with the intention of turning everything upside-down a ways down the road. In particular I like to look at something from Skarpi's Lanre story, in which Selitos curses Lanre:

""This is my doom upon you. Your own name will be turned against you, that you shall have no peace. This is my doom upon you and all who follow you."" TNotW Kindle location 2646

This seems a very innocuous statement, but I think it holds a lot in terms of the nature of Haliax and the Chandrian, in particular the last sentence and the mention of ""all who follow you"". They hunt people who speak their names because they are accursed and their names torment them (presumably), Haliax initially and the others because they follow him. But where did the others come from, how did they get roped into this? Perhaps they followed Haliax with the intent of killing him for his crimes intially, but because they followed at all, they became Chandrian themselves, and are now cursed the same as Haliax, due to Selitos' curse. This carried on until they were seven and somebody figured out what was going on, and then the hunting of those who spoke their names began. From there I think it can go in one of two directions.

Option 1: The Chandrian are in fact killing all these people that encounter them, Kvothe's troupe and the wedding party in Trebon, as Kvothe currently leads us to believe. If this is the case, I believe they're doing it to save these people from a worse fate, that of becoming cursed as they are. In this case, the Amyr are hunting them for killing innocents all the time and generally being cursed baddies, which is the apparent situation. 

Option 2: These groups are in fact being killed by the Amyr, with the Chandrian following in the aftermath for whatever currently unknown reason. This is addressed in [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/KingkillerChronicle/comments/1jyiei/things_kvothe_knows/) thread, which inspired this post. The Amyr may be killing these people and destroying all information about the Chandrian or themselves ""for the greater good"", to prevent the curse of the Chandrian from spreading further. This behavior is in line with their mantra, and the Amyr are in a much better position (or at least were, as they were formerly affiliated with a very powerful church) to purge the records of the world of all mention of themselves or the Chandrian than the Chandrian seem to be. I think this is a much more interesting scenario, but the question now becomes why do the Chandrian follow in the wake of the Amyr, especially since these people are being killed for talking about/accidentally finding information on the Chandrian.

The first, most obvious thing to me, is how both authors have the ""normal"" world either overlapping or juxtaposed with a magical world. Gaiman has done this in all of his novels that I've read (*Neverwhere, American Gods, Stardust*, and now *The Ocean at the End of the Lane*). I found each of these situations similar to the existence of the Fae in KKC. Though Pat takes this a step further in how his ""normal"" world contains some pretty spectacular ""magic"". 

I've read a fair few, but not a TON of fantasy novels so these may be pretty common elements within the genre that I've just only seen in these two instances. 

However, the thing that really stands out to me are the similarities between Auri's subplots in KKC and Gaiman's *Neverwhere*, especially if one accepts certain speculations about Auri. Both Auri and *Neverwhere*'s Door are slight young women, who the protagonist finds in vulnerable situations and does his best to help out. They both seem odd and sort of fey, and Door definitely possesses some VERY powerful abilities, despite being otherwise unassuming. I think (due to theories discussed here that I won't get into), that Auri will be revealed to be way more powerful than she appears as well. 

The commonality between Door and Auri that I think is most specific, as opposed to just being coincidental similarities between authors writing for similar audiences, is Auri's Underthing and Door's London Below. I think its a pretty specific similarity that both of these characters (who are at least somewhat similar otherwise), show the protagonist a hidden world that exists beneath the city that they live in. 

TL;DR: Things like Stormhold in Gaiman's novels remind me of the Fae in KKC. Also, I think Door from *Neverwhere* bears some striking similarities to Auri. 

Again, these things may be of no significance, but I know Rothfuss has read at least some (probably most/all) of Gaiman's books, and may have been influenced/inspired by him to some degree.

So I don't have my book so there won't be any nice quotes or page references, but I have posted this same theory on another board somewhere in the internet.

Let's go chronologically. **This is your last chance to avoid spoilers. I'm going to talk about stuff that will spoil the books if you haven't read them**.

1) When Kvothe's troupe is killed by the Chandrian. During this scene, Haliax (shadowy face guy) asks who protects the Chandrian from the Amyr. Implying they exist. Then, after Cinder gets to OK to kill Kvothe, the Chandrian look towards the sky, ""like they can hear music"" or something. Then the Chandrian peace out really fast. AKA the Amyr were coming and the Chandrian had to beat it.

Now remember that the reason the Chandrian were attracted to the troupe was because Kvothe's parents were writing a song about them, and repeating their names over and over and over. This is established in Ademre in Book 2, when the Adem tell Kvothe the name of the Chandrian but say essentially  ""We can only say this once. Saying someone's true name attracts them"".

**So we know that Kvothe's parents repeated the Chandrian's names to attract them, and the Chandrian fled when they ""heard"" or sensed the Amyr coming.**

Next: Skarpi's story. There's the one about how Myr Tyraniel is destroyed. But the second one talks about how Selitos petitions to go after the ~~Amyr~~Chandrian (typos trolol). A few people join him, among them Tehlu (*I think*). They get their wings of iron and fire and glass and blood and whatnot *and it references white fire*, then ""They become hidden from all but the most powerful"" or something. AKA, unless you're a badass namer or super powerful, *you can't see them*. This explains why the Chandrian looked like they were hearing music from far away. Only they could perceive them and Kvothe couldn't.

Edit: I realize that Aleph told them not to, but Selitos basically says ""No. I'm going after the Chandrian."" and they get changed anyways. *If memory serves*. I'll check again when I get a chance.

**We've established the Amyr are angel-like, invisible warriors who hunt the Chandrian. They also have wings of flame, and are connected to white fire.**

Fast forward to Book 2 when Kvothe and Tempi and whatnot are attacking the bandit camp. Kvothe goes deep into the heart of stone, and becomes really scary. The woodsman (I can't remember his name) gets freaked out, drops his bow, and starts *praying*. He's praying to Tehlu, and some other people who's names were coincidentally mentioned in Skarpi's story. And not just praying. He's *repeating* their names over and over and over. 

**What do we know about repeating the name of a powerful being? It attracts said being**

The leader of the camp is strangely familiar to Kvothe, and if memory serves he actually takes an arrow but it doesn't even phase him. Then, when things are getting crazy, Kvothe goes for a last ditch effort. Pulls his remaining alar together, grounds the huge tree, and while he's grounding the tree *the leader of the camp tilts his head like he can hear music far away* and bounds back into the tents. Kvothe notes the familiarly graceful movements. Then kvothe passes out as there's a giant flash of light.

The next day everyone fills in Kvothe. It was strange. Not just one bolt of lightning hit the tree, but several. Looking like a ""pillar of white fire"". And the body of the leader? Never found.

So obviously, Cinder is the leader of the bandits, the woodsman is praying to Tehlu and other Amyr, repeating their names over and over. Cinder realizes they're coming, runs for it. The Amyr show up and explode the tree as ""lightning"". It appears as lightning because people either 1) Would attribute lightning striking the tree rather than holy angels attacking a demon or 2) because they can't perceive the Amyr not being powerful enough. I'll point this out for you in case you missed it. 

**Kvothe was unconscious when the Amyr showed up. That's why he didn't see them.**

Wake up, world.

**Edit: So I know that the Amyr were an actual organization. There's two types of Amyr. The church nights, and then the ones in skarpi's story. There's a dichotomy between the organization, and the angels that Aleph changed. Also thanks to /u/hexenir for mentioning Aleph. Couldn't remember the name to save my life. QQ**

**Edit 2: I found a quote. It's from Ch. 29 of aNotW.

In my opinion there are a lot of ""things"" in the books that ""could"" be interpreted as Zen messages.

First thing i noticed was that Bast refers to Kote as Reshi. In Zen the teacher/master is called a Roshi. Kote is teaching Bast, but more importantly he seems to be instructing him in life lessons as well. One salient message is when Kote says (something akin to): The best decisions I ever made came from not thinking."" This is startlingly similar to Zen ideas of ""empty"" mind, or ineffable logic.

Second, lots of Zen metaphors revolve around the Moon, typically as a symbol of reflection or enlightenment. What do wise men fear? A moonless night. What does that mean in Zen? A mind blinded to self-reflection, prone to thoughtless, spur of the moment actions. Abenthy's final lesson to Kvothe: ""There is nothing more dangerous than a clever, thoughtless man."" Which is itself a critical Zen message.

Not sure how Jax's story of the moon would tie into this, I don't fully remember that part. I only vaguely remember Jax meeting somebody who may or maynot have warned him against his quest for  the moon? I might be terribly wrong here idk.

Third, (this is a stretch) The description of what it is like to Name something and how you go about Naming something, and the description of an experience often refered to as ""A moment of Oneness"", or may also be referred to ""Enlightenment"" are incredibly similar. Interestingly, and contrary to misconceptions, Zen teaches that these moments of ""ineffabilty"" are ultimately meaningless and that what really matters is retaining everyday/common wisdom.

Lastly, Kvothe's life at the Waystone inn (barring interaction with customers) is nearly identical to that of life in a Zen retreat or Zen monastary.

Anyway, I stumbled on this subreddit last week, got excited and started rereading the books. This is a theory about the Chandrian, the battle at the bandit camp, and Kvothe's 'dumb luck' lighting strike.

While Kvothe is searching through the Archives for stories of the Chandrian, he says that he found only one poem.

&gt;The Chandrian move from place to place,  
But they never leave a trace.  
They hold their secrets very tight,  
But they never scratch and they never bite.  
They never fight and they never fuss.  
In fact they are quite nice to us.  
They come and they go in the blink of an eye,  
Like a bright bolt of lighting out of the sky.

The interesting bit is the last sentence. Is it possible that the lightning strike wasn't dumb luck, but was literally Cinder leaving in the blink of an eye? It might just be an unconnected coincidence, but  we know where he is right up until he enters the tent and the lightning strikes.

It may be nothing more than an interesting coincidence. It may also be the very method of travel for the Chandrian. I just thought it was nifty.

&gt; “Master Elodin,” I asked slowly. “What would you think of someone who kept changing their own name?”
&gt; “What?” He sat up suddenly, his eyes wild and panicked. “What have you done?”
&gt; His reaction startled me, and I held up my hands defensively. “Nothing!” I insisted. “It’s not me. It’s a girl I know.”
&gt; Elodin’s face grew ashen. “Fela?” he said. “Oh no. No. She wouldn’t do something like that. She’s too smart for that.” It sounded as if he were desperately trying to convince himself.
&gt; “I’m not talking about Fela,” I said. “I’m talking about a young girl I know. Every time I turn around she’s picked another name for herself.”
“Oh,” Elodin said, relaxing. He leaned back against the tree, laughing softly. “Calling names,” he said with tangible relief. “God’s bones, boy, I thought . . .” He broke off, shaking his head.

Elodin's fear suggests that changing a name is a very powerful and very dangerous thing to do. If a name is tied to the very nature of the object it describes, then changing a name must change the namee itself.

For this reason, I suspect that the ""shapers"" Felurian talked about are name changers! The following passage suggests it:
&gt; “then came those who saw a thing and thought of changing it. they thought in terms of mastery. they were shapers. proud dreamers.” 

Perhaps Jax and his shaper crew changed the names of many things! I also suspect that Lanre changed his name when he became Haliax. In his grief, he changed who he was to cope with the death of his wife.

Maybe, and this is a definite stretch, maybe Kvothe changed his name too and the innkeeper is more then just acting. Maybe he's in the process of changing his name somehow. I would assume that shaping combines the difficulty of understanding something with a force of will to master and shape it. Maybe his method acting is dangerously close to the willpower necessary to change his own name and Bast is trying to reverse this process and get Kvothe out of his funk. At this point, it's purely speculation, but maybe Kvothe locked part of himself up in the thrice-locked trunk by his bed similar to how Jax stored the moon's name in the box and somehow, in doing so, he is changing himself.",,False,self,t5_2smxb,False,,,True,t3_1k4jv4,http://www.reddit.com/r/KingkillerChronicle/comments/1k4jv4/spoilers_all_changing_a_name_and_the_shapers/,

I then begun to think about Denna's song she was creating with the help with her patron. Denna's song was about how Lanre was a hero. Lanre, or Haliax, is the leader of the Chandrian. This would explain why Cinder would be helping Denna create this song. Cinder and the Chandrian are trying to spread heroic stories of Lanre, unlike the story that Scarpi told in Book One. 

However, the Chandrian would kill anyone that discovered something about them that was unsavory to them, such as the song that Arliden created, and the people at the wedding who discovered the urn. If this is the case, then what about the Amyr? If the Amyr were to discover that Denna was going to reveal a song that praised Lanre, what would they do? Their motto, ""For the greater good,"" leads me to believe that they would end Denna's life. To allow the public to hear about how Lanre was a hero, not a villain, would not stand well with the Amyr. 

In the beginning of the book, it seems that Denna is a famous figure. Kvothe says that whatever you have heard of her, you might as well discard it. This leads us to believe that Denna is quite well-known. I think that the reason she was so famous was because she might have died of unknown reasons after publishing her song. However, the reasons of her death would only be unknown to the general public. Kvothe would know that the Amyr had killed her. 

This leads me to another theory. People on this reddit say that Kvothe killed one of the Chandrian and became one of them, obtaining one of their signs, the silence. I think that after becoming one of the Chandrian, the Amyr also became Kvothe's enemy. After they killed Denna, Kvothe sealed away his name in the thrice-locked chest to hide away.

(Spoilers All),18,3,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/KingkillerChronicle/comments/1ecl7f/who_are_the_angels_spoilers_all/,"I've gotten a lot of positive feedback on my theory that the angels spoken of in Skarpi's story were volunteers who were set on a path of perpetual rebirth.

With the story implying that they would forget what they knew I assume they would start fresh each time they were reborn with no recollection of previous lives. The statement that they ""must punish or reward only what you yourself witness from this day forth"" fits with that theory and also explains at least part of the reason for this change. In light of this it stands out to me how frequently Kvothe metes out justice without thinking of it as such. He'll steal pens and ink from an asshole bookshop owner, but leave money for a cobbler who asked for none. He does many things to aid the Maer (though this is also all in his own self interest) who is a good man, but also goes out of his way to pay back Ambrose's horrid behavior regardless of its potential (inevitable) cost to himself. His repayment is blind to status or wealth.

(By the way: This also led me to the speculation that the reincarnated angels had, in the past, eventually become the Ciridae. As purified souls (per Skarpi's story) their judgement would understandably be ""above reproach"", and I could not imagine what else would be enough to grant someone that distinction... Add to that the times Kvothe is mentioned as a Ciridae (by Auri) and the times he had some imagery around him that might imply that link (Perhaps the blood running down his hands as he cleared the bandit camp was close to the events that were the actual origin of the tattoos.) This would mean that the angels reborn had allied themselves with the Amir, those that had a similar calling but pursued it in a different way, which would make very much sense.)

I've speculated that Kvothe is the reborn Tehlu. I also believe that Taborlin, Aethe, Sir Savien, Menda and Illien are previous incarnations since each excelled so clearly in their own ways and gained notoriety the way the others did. (This might also mean Kvothe is the 7th incarnation of Tehlu, and the number 7 is mentioned as special more than once.) I believe Ben's comment that Kvothe would be the best at whatever he chose is important as well. Since Illien never fought the Chandrian as far as we're aware, perhaps that incarnation never witnessed their work and thus could not punish them. Taborlin, by extension, would then be an incarnation that DID witness the Chandrian's work (or maybe only Cyphus, or maybe Cyphus wronged him particularly, reminiscent of Kvothes particular obsession with Cinder) and therefore did what he needed to do to bring them to justice.

If all this is true, then Denna might be the reincarnation of Deah (who had a hundred suitors in Belen before the walls fell. The first woman to know the unasked-for touch of man.) and so might Eloine? Could this romance be the continuation of a courtship that began in Tinue 5,000 years ago? That would certainly make a compelling story. How might Tehlu have reacted to Deah's situation given what we know of him? I think the attraction and fear of coming on too strong would be likely... This makes too much sense to me to be less than confident in it.

If I'm right, the reincarnated angels should all have some general similarities to Kvothe. According to Scarpi, Kvothe, as Tehlu, is the greatest of them, but the others should have some measure of what makes him stand out. He learns quickly. He has affinities for certain things, especially music. He's driven. He's just. And if Denna is more than a coincidence, they might all gravitate to each other, making the whole cast of characters potential candidates.

I'd already thought that Devi was a solid candidate, but what started me asking this question was listening to the audio book today and hearing Kvothe's thoughts of Simmon, ""Good, honest, gentle Sim. He could never bring himself to say bad things about another person, just imply them. Even that was hard for him."" and it reminded me of the description of Enlas, ""who would not carry a sword or eat the flesh of animals, and who no man had ever known to speak hard words."" If this is a positive link, what other evidence is there? I went through the descriptions and mentions of the various characters and started trying to compile a list of who I think the angels are.

In the following list, I've included sex (when the sex is clear), the name of the volunteer, the description from Scarpi's story, my guesses as to their current identity, What their special talent might be, and a work-in-progress of citations of passages that support my guesses.

Please give feedback. I'd love to know your guesses and reasoning and will update the list if I think your guess is better than mine. (Credited of course. :D)

(M)Tehlu - But Tehlu stood forward saying, ""I hold justice foremost in my heart. I will leave this world behind that I might better serve it, serving you."" He knelt before Aleph, his head bowed, his hands open at his sides.

Kvothe - (?)

(WMF:23)""You look like an Amyr,"" she said. ""Kvothe is one of the Ciridae.""

(WMF:24)""You are my Ciridae, and thus above reproach."" She reached out to touch the center of my bloody chest with a finger. ""Ivare enim euge.""

(WMF:35)""They were all awful to look at. But he was the worst. I can't get faces right, but his was terrible grim. He looked so angry. He looked like he was ready to burn down the whole world.""

(NOW:28)Then Aleph spoke their long names and they were wreathed in a white fire. The fire danced along their wings and they became swift. The fire flickered in their eyes and they saw into the deepest hearts of men. The fire filled their mouths and they sang songs of power. Then the fire settled on their foreheads like silver stars and they became at once righteous and wise and terrible to behold. Then the fire consumed them and they were gone forever from mortal sight.

(WMF:97)I felt as if this was the only time in my life I had been fully awake. Everything looked clear and sharp, as if I was seeing with a new set of eyes. As if I wasn't bothering with my eyes at all, and was looking at the world directly with my mind. The sleeping mind, some piece of me realized faintly. No longer sleeping, I thought and smiled(...)Now I knew her to the marrow of her bones. Her eyes were like four lines of music, clearly penned. My mind was filled with the sudden song of her. I drew a breath and sang it out in four hard notes(...)I cupped my hands and breathed a sigh into the hollow space within. I spoke a name. I moved my hands and wove my breath gossamer-thin. It billowed out, engulfing her, then burst into a silver flame that trapped her tight inside its changing name(...)I spoke again, and the wind brought her down among the pillows. I made a tearing motion and the silver flame that once had been my breath became three notes of broken song and went to play among the trees(...)I saw myself reflected in her eyes, naked among the cushions. My power rode like a white star on my brow.

&lt;-------------------------&gt;

Kirel - Tall Kirel, who had been burned but left living in the ash of Myr Tariniel.

Fela - (?)

(NOW:68)""This isn't the hand of some swooning princess who sits tatting lace and waiting for some prince to save her. This is the hand of a woman who would climb a rope of her own hair to freedom, or kill a captor ogre in his sleep."" I looked into her eyes. ""And this is the hand of a woman who would have made it through the fire on her own if I hadn't been there. Singed perhaps, but safe.""

&lt;-------------------------&gt;

(F)Deah - Deah, who had lost two husbands to the fighting, and whose face and mouth and heart were hard and cold as stone.

Devi - (Sympathy)

(WMF:)""I made Re'lar before they threw me out, you little slipstick. I earned it. My Alar is like
the ocean in storm.""

(WMF:)""Oh you're very good. I almost believe the stories about you now. But what makes you think you can do what even Elxa Dal couldn't? Why do you think they expelled me? They feared a woman who could match a master by her second year."" Sweat made her pale hair cling to her forehead. She clenched her teeth, her pixie face savage with determination.

&lt;-------------------------&gt;

Enlas - Enlas, who would not carry a sword or eat the flesh of animals, and who no man had ever known to speak hard words.

Simmon - (Alchemy)

(NoW:54)I liked Simmon, but he was terribly innocent at times.

(NoW:56)Wilem put a protective arm around Simmon, who leaned unashamedly against his shoulder. ""Our Simmon has a tender heart,"" he said gently. ""I imagine he meant to say that he liked it very much.""

(NoW:65)""I like them,"" she said. ""Wilem is a stone in deep water. Simmon is like a boy splashing in a brook.""

(NoW:87)""I love you, Sim,"" I said earnestly. ""Sometimes I think you're the only honest person I know.""
He looked me over. ""You're drunk.""
""No, it's the truth. You're a good person. Better than I'll ever be.""

(NoW:91)Good, honest, gentle Sim. He could never bring himself to say bad things about another person, just imply them. Even that was hard for him.

(WMF:33)""In the interest of pure accuracy,"" Fela said in an offhand way, ""Ambrose didn't use the words 'daft bint.' "" She didn't let go of Sim's arm. Simmon looked a little embarrassed. ""Yes, well. There are some things
you don't call a lady, even in fun."" He reluctantly let go of Fela and sat on the trunk of the fallen tree. Fela sat next to him.

(WMF:39)""I have a hard time imagining Sim as a priest,"" I admitted. ""Or a soldier, come to think of it.""

&lt;-------------------------&gt;

(F)Geisa - Fair Geisa, who had a hundred suitors in Belen before the walls fell, the first woman to know the un-asked-for touch of man.

Denna

&lt;-------------------------&gt;

(M)Lecelte - Lecelte, who laughed easily and often, even when there was woe thick about him.

Scarpi?

&lt;-------------------------&gt;

(M)Imet - Imet, hardly more than a boy, who never sang and killed swiftly, without tears.

Wilem

&lt;-------------------------&gt;

(F)Ordal - Ordal, the youngest of them all, who had never seen a thing die, stood bravely before Aleph, her golden hair bright with ribbon.

Auri

Kvothe buys her ribbons for her hair.
More to come.

&lt;-------------------------&gt;

Andan - And beside her came Anden, whose face was a mask with burning eyes, whose name meant ""anger"".

Elodin (Naming)

(WMF:127)""You have a fine anger."" I lay on my back, her small body curled under my arm, her heart-shaped face resting gently on my chest. ""What do you mean by that?"" I asked. ""I think anger might be the wrong word.""
""I mean Vaevin,"" she said, using the Ademic term. ""Is that the same?"" ""I don't know that word,"" I admitted.
""I think anger is the right word,"" she said. ""I have spoken with Vashet in your language, and she did not correct me.""

In WMF a small boy they meet after the Felurian incident tells K a poem about the Lackless door. 

Seven things stand before

The entrance to the Lackless door

One of them a ring unworn

One a word that is forsworn

One a time that must be right

One a candle without light

One a son who brings the blood

One a door that holds the flood

One a thing tight-held in keeping

Then comes that which comes with sleeping. 


So I think this is a reference to the Lackless box, which based on the theory that Jax is the progenitor of the Lackless family, holds the moon. 

The third line might be the wooden ring k was given, or maybe a ring of wind, implying you need the name of the wind to open it.

Not sure about the fourth line, but the fifth line implies that you have to open it at the right time. I'm guessing a moonless night, which has some importance.

Not sure about line 6, it could be the candle Auri gave K, if the theory that Auri is the moon is true (I support this theory a lot. I didn't until my third reread though, there is a good amount of support to it)

The soon who brings blood is clearly Kvothe, since it's well accepted he is the niece of maurlian Lackless. 

Door that holds the flood is whatever door the losers of the creation war were sealed behind, which might include Jax. I think it's the 4 plated door in the archives. 

Not sure what the tight held in keeping is, but the last line refers to the moon I think, which ties most of this theory together.

I feel like most of this comes from the first book (minus Jax/Iax), but I'd much rather discuss this with people who have read both.

Maybe this isn't the greatest way to format this... I just want to get a sense of a timeline across.

Is Lyra the moon? Think about it:

- The Creation War starts because Jax/Iax creates the Fae. Namers and Shapers don't get along for control/perspective/general POV reasons. So they fight an unending war. [Side note: maybe the Jax realizes his Fae realm is missing awesome things {LIKE A MOON?!} and wants him/his folk to steal them from the other realm?]

- Lanre comes around, wrecks shit. He totally turns the tables. Even the shapers' huge black beast can't beat him, so they're all like ""aw shit, we got nothing."" (Lyra helps)

- War starts to end, peaceful-ish times abound - BUT - Jax steals Lyra. His realm needs her. Or maybe he does. Or maybe she's a smokin' babe.

- Lanre gets pissed (duh) and leaves his forces to get Lyra back, thus the rumors are created (Lanre went mad, Lyra left the empire, Lyra is dead, etc.)

- Lanre finds Jax, finds out Lyra has been bound between both realms forever and that he will never truly be with her again.

- Lanre kills Jax/Iax and in his last words Jax/Iax binds himself into Lanre. Or Lanre kills him in a way that sucks his powers and soul. This gives Lanre his skill at binding and naming. But still no Lyra.

- Lanre decides that the only way to get Lyra back is to destroy one realm/both of the realms. (THE CHANDRIAN'S PLAN?)

- Uses new skillz on Selitos, Selitos fucks him up and in doing so finds something close to his new being, Haliax, and curses him in sleepless shadows.

The early part of NotW implies so strongly that it has something to do with his ""thrice-locked box"" - he spends an evening with Bast and talking to guests at the inn, starts looking normal and calm again, and then walks to his room.

In his room, he refuses to look at the chest the same way you would avoid the eyes of an old lover or an old enemy. Eventually his eyes light on it and ""an expression of unbridled longing and regret"" crosses his face. 

What has he locked in the box? His good left hand? His name and his power? A part of his name, like Ludis? (Presumably the V and the H, making him Kote 'Disaster' rather than Kvothe 'To Know'.) Whatever it is, it clearly represents his own identity, his heroism and his power, and he can't do what he once did. 

When he falls on the box, desperately trying to open it, at the end of TWMF, it broke my heart. Why did he lock himself away like that? Did he kill someone he loved like Auri, or does he believe that he will only do harm due to the Cthaeh's influence? He clearly thinks he is somehow responsible for the troubles in the world (""Kote,"" again) but is he right?

Also, I noticed that when he sees the scraeling, he notes that it was hard ""like porcelain...no...more like stone."" Stone, one of the things that is Named by Namers in the story. Stone, the doors of which contain the Enemy. I am now certain that the Scrael are Shaped, and I think it's likely that the Shapers (the enemy?) are loose in the world again.

* We know, for sure, someone tries to kill Kvothe.

Alright, so we know Caesura is ""The Poet Killer."" I know that a popular theory is that Ambrose is poet the sword kills. Of course, another popular theory is that Ambrose is also the King that's killed plunging the Four Corners into war.

But as I was rereading recently and two thoughts kept coming up:

1. Kote tells us this story is a tragedy. Ambrose dying at Kvothe's hands isn't tragic. Potentially starting a war might be considered tragic, but I think of something more personal for Kvothe.

2. Sim is a much better poet. It's Sim that tells us what Caesura (the poetry term, not the sword) is. And Sim is one of the very, very few people I can think of in Kvothe's life who's death might be considered a tragedy. Sim is also heir to a Duchy in Atura. 

I forget for certain, but do the Aturans have a monarchy? Or is it possible that through other actions a monarchy is created?

I'm kinda picturing through accident, misunderstanding or something, perhaps Sim is killed. This is a much more tragic death, and that leaves the possibility of Ambrose still being alive, perhaps as the Penitent King (though probably not really penitent, perhaps called so because lots of people have to die in order for him to ascend, which would make a non-jackass penitent.)

My apologies in advance if this comes up later as part of the WMF re-read, I haven't started that yet.

So we know that a king has been killed and that it has led to civil unrest and outright war in the frame story. We know that regardless of how things *actually* went down, K strongly feels that he is responsible for the current situation. Finally, we know that the current king, or at least the head of one faction in the civil war, is known as the ""Penitent King"". Much of the speculation regarding this title focused on penitent in the more literal sense of who might have cause to feel remorse and why.

This reading, however, is missing at least half the point, (and I swear this has come up in at least one previous re-read post, though it was entirely ignored in the speculative summary) because we've already met a group known as penitent. From the Midwinter Pageant episode during Kvothe's time in Tarbean: ""Many of [the grey-robed procession] wore the heavy iron chains of penitent priests"" (NotW Ch. 22).

Granted, the association with a religious order still leaves ample room for the PK to feel remorse, but it would be entirely unlike Mr. Rothfuss to simply leave the meaning at ""the new king is sad about something"" especially in light of giving the readers this detail way back in chapter 22 of book 1. 

With this association in mind, one might wonder what advantage an aspiring king would find in identifying with what I think it's safe to assume is a fairly extreme and/or orthodox branch of the Tehlin Church, OR how a true believer rose to kingship, AND/OR what this hints at regarding a resurgence of the church (Amyr?) as a political power, since we are told most of the church's absolute power crumbled with the fall of the empire... 

Iron chains are reminiscent of Tehlu v. Encanis, could the frame war be the result of Kvothe's having freed the original (non-human) Amyr, thinking they were the good side and would help him fight the Chandrian, but who are instead attempting to bring the world under heel, or burn it down trying, ""for the greater good""? Then again, according to Skarpi, Tehlu heads up the angels and not the Amyr, which begs the further question of how the human Amyr order became entangled with the Tehlin church to begin with. Then again AGAIN we've been shown there is nothing like a consensus regarding Tehlin doctrine even internally, much less its relation to broader historical fact...",,False,self,t5_2smxb,False,,,True,t3_1fduv4,http://www.reddit.com/r/KingkillerChronicle/comments/1fduv4/speculation_on_the_penitent_king_spoilers_all/,

Where is the Waystone Inn? It's never really addressed. We know it's in Newarre, wherever the hell that is. Aside from this, we as the readers are never given a really clear cut answer as to why Kote decided to settle where he is.

The one hint I've managed to scrounge up is that it is somewhere far west on the map. This comes from the opening part of NoTW, when Kvothe is surprised that the scrael had ""made it this far west.""

The Commonwealth, where K grew up, is the most western part of the map besides the Cealdish territory. But see, how do we know that the inn is not in Ceald, that they're speaking the Cealdish language?

Also, this struck a cord with me:

""He called himself Kote. He had chosen the name carefully when he came to this place. He had taken a new name for most of the usual reasons and a few unusual ones as well, not the least of which was the fact that names were important to him.""

Usual reasons? He wanted to escape from something, that much we can assume. But why escape so far to the west? We know scraeling war started in the east, as their spread indicates. We know that there's a lot of fae action going on in the east, which is where Kvothe presumably picked up Bast. Possibly, he is located where he is because he is closest to the Amyr? Or conversely, the last sight of the Seven? He is waiting to die, after all, what's the quickest way to go other than placing yourself in the maw of your opponent? Or maybe, he is distancing himself from all memory of his previous life? Looking on the map, by the time The Doors of Stone roll around, the only place K will not have visited will have been Ceald. Technically, he was in Modeg because of his month in The Eld, but maybe Wilem takes him to his ancestral home later in the story?

Another note on why I don't think they're in The Commonwealth, is because at the beginning of NoTW, Shep and Old Cob talk about the Pentient King have issues with the rebels and the taxes. Yet, the Commonwealth doesn't have a king. Does that mean it is also possible that the inn is in the Small Kingdoms?

It seems that each one has his/her own sign, as evidenced by the Adem poem/story

*Cyphus bears the blue flame, Stercus is in the thrall of Iron, Ferule chill and dark of eye, Usnea lives in nothing but decay, grey Dalcenti never speaks, pale Alenta brings the blight, last their is the lord of seven, Hated. Hopeless. Sleepless. Sane. Alaxel bears the shadows hame.*

It is fair to say that Ferula is Cinder's true name, as he is described as extremely pale with black eyes, and *Ferula* is used by Haliax to cause him pain. 

Haliax/Lanre is five thousand years old (evidenced when Caeth says Haliax is five thousand years old) so we can estimate that the Amyr, and Chandrian were founded atleast around five thousand years ago when the empire with Myr Tariniel existed. 

Now, in Sheyhn's story she says the enemy of this empire poisoned seven other and six of them forgot the lethani and betrayed their cities, while one rembered the lethani and the city was saved. From the sound of this, it sounds that Lanre went to each of the cities and turned each of their leaders/rulers against the city, I believe that each of these rulers became one of the Chandrian. The one that remembered the lethani could be Selitos, even though his city, Myr Tariniel, fell. 

- I have two theories for the doors of stone. 
1. - They are the waystones, and the waystones are portal to the Fae realm
2.  My second theory makes more sense, in Skarpi's story Lanre turned the tide of battle, and pushed the enemy behind the doors of stone. Ferulian says that Iax (man who stole the moon) was also locked behind the doors of stone. So what if the Creation war was the war between the Shapers, and the Namers, the war that was occuring when Iax stole the moon. Now the scrael make sense if they were locked behind the door, and for some reason the door was open by Kvothe or someone. It would explain the Scrael, and the Fae man that  came into the waystone inn.

She seems to occupy a strange role as a character. Before I go any further, I would like to say that I think she is an excellent and incredibly vital portion of the story. However...

What do we know about her really? It has been postured within the story that she is a student who cracked under the mental pressure of the University. However, if this is the case, I think it would stand to reason that Elodin would already know more about her as opposed to hoping to learn about her as we see in WMF. Auri also appears to have not only knowledge but also previous interactions with the Amyr and more particularly the Ciridae. This is rare. As a plot point, Auri is the reason Elodin invited Kvothe into his naming class. She also assisted Kvothe in finding a secret entrance to the Archives. 

All that said, my question boils down to this: what can we expect from Auri in book three? As far as we have seen, Rothfuss only includes as much detail and exposition as is required to move his story along. Given this, if we were not going to see any more of Auri in book three, we wouldn't have been exposed to any details of her complicated background.

At the end of WMF when Kvothe is talking to Elodin on the roof he mentions something about someones name changing (sorry for the vagueness, I'm at work and don't have access to my books and it's been a few months since I last read the book.) and Elodin freaks the hell out before he calms down and realizes Kvothe doesn't mean someone changed their true name, so it's clearly possible, if not exactly advisable, to change ones true name.

Now when we first meet Kvothe he's going by the name Kote a much simpler name with a less complex meaning. But he's not just *going by* Kote. He has *become* Kote. This is why his powers are failing, why he can't beat up those thugs, and why he is continually described as looking 'less'.

I'm guessing it's a hard thing to maintain, like it was incompletely done (possible reason it's so ill-advised?). And this is why we see the occasional glimpse of Kvothe and his awesomeness.

 ""I'd say it was a twice-in-a-lifetime-opportunity meeting up with him again.""

This implies that Kvothe has only met Cinder twice. Therefore, the meetings with Bredon would not count, which would mean he is not Cinder.

""It's been a long time. Years.""

Again, this idea is repeated.

""Besides, you've been busy: currying favor . . .""

Kvothe was currying favor with the Maer, which is where he spent his time with Bredon. The Cthaeh is making a clear distinction between Kvothe's time spent there and the time he has spent in the presence or area of Cinder.

While the Cthaeh does go on to make a couple other comments that might suggest a connection between Bredon and Cinder (""it's a game to him"" and ""he used his walking stick""), the evidence seems to point more in the idea that they are not the same entity. 

Also, it should be noted that Kvothe specifically recognized Cinder's movement when he saw him as the leader of the bandits. The Cthaeh even points this out, that he recognized him. There was no mention of Kvothe recognizing anything about Bredon. No familiarity. Despite the fact that Kvothe can be quite ""thick,"" Rothfuss usually makes some small mention whenever we have a plot clue. Another example would be when Kvothe meets Meluan for the first time, and recognizes her as well.

The Cthaeh seems to only think Denna's patron is important because he beats her. The actual person doesn't seem to have all that much importance. I do particularly like the idea of her patron's master being Cinder, though. I think that would make much more sense.

Also, it could be that the Cthaeh is lying or manipulating the data, but Felurian specifically says ""the Cthaeh does not lie.""

It is pretty obvious that he is currently unable to open it, and that he really wants to.  My thought is that he ""hid"" the answer to how to open the box inside of his own mind like he used to in the practices that Abenthy had him do.  Where he splits his mind and has one part hide a stone or whatever it was and the other part has to find it.  I think he did this with the method to open the box, and will only be able to figure it out when some specific event happens.  (possibly regaining his mastery over the Heart of Stone?)

Edit:To add to him needing to regain mastery over the Heart of Stone, I agree with the theory I saw floating somewhere on this site that his alar is broken.  He always mentioned that his alar was like Ramston Steel, which we have learned can be quite fragile if pushed in the wrong way.  Maybe he attempts something too strong or tries to fight something from the Fae and the stress breaks his alar?  I dunno, just my random 3 am thoughts

The preceding chapter is one of the interludes and Kvothe is talking to Chronicler about the second levy tax that is imminent. Chronicler says that the levy taxes are despised by the nobility more than the commoners, but Kvothe says that he finds that hard to believe. He then goes on to explain that his father had experienced 2 levy taxes in ""twenty years"" and had some unsavoury things to say about the tax collecters. Kvothe claims that his fathered had a severe disdain for the men coming through ""his lands"" collecting the levy tax. 

I wouldn't have normally thought anything significant of the passage, but almost immediately after Kvothe has said this he tells Chronicler that he never paid taxes until he began running the inn. He says ""as a rule, the Edema Ruh don't own property"". Now this got my mind thinking about what Kvothe had previously just said about his father disliking the tax collecters coming through ""his lands"". His father is clearly one of the Edema Ruh and therefore surely doesn't own any property, nevermind land. 

The two passages just seem to sit uncomfortabley together and it made me view one of Kvothe's defining characteristics in a different light. Kvothe is extremely proud of his Ruh upbringing and he is constantly reaffiriming that he is ""Edema Ruh to his bones"". Is it possible that Kvothe finds out that his biological father is not Arliden, but he feels obliged to stay loyal to his childhood 'father'? 

I'm not sure what to think and I don't have any clue who his father could be otherwise. The only one who could spring to mind is the Maer Alvaron, but I have no evidence whatsover to support that. It could also be that it is just a mistake by Rothfuss, but given his meticulous habits I find it hard to believe.

Does anyone know when or what on, Arliden could have paid taxes for? The other part that is troubling me is that Kvothe said that ""in twenty years my father paid the levy tax twice"". Now, presumably there's an age when you start paying taxes and Arliden died twenty years after that, but again that suggests that Arliden had property to pay taxes on and again that sits in direct contradiction to Kvothe's comment that the Edema Ruh ""don't own property as a rule"". 

I'm not sure where I am going with this thought, but it struck me as being significant. Just the contradiction of what Kvothe says was enough to get me thinking.

The Duke of Richmoney (jokingly), then
Frederick,
Frank,
Feran,
Forue,
Fordale.

It seems to be approximating towards Ferule/Ferula. The letters are getting in there. This combined with Kvothe's knack for guessing names has me totally convinced that the patron is Cinder.

Wiki helps some.

I think the Cthaeh is central to it all. We know lanry spoke to it ok it didn't say straight out it caused what lanry did but i imagined it influenced his decision.

The reason i bring up the Cthaeh, the one thing that really bugged me throughout the books was the seemingly random encounters with denna, always at key parts in kvothes life. Were they fate, or was there a little help from the Cthaeh. I'm convinced denna has visited it, i thinks she's been to the Fae, i'm not sure is she one though. Kvothe said she has the look of the fae, Deoch commented that she seemed older than her years(kvothe spent almost a year in the fae but only 2-3 days passed in his world). When he left her in NOTW to battle the drakus, he left her at a waystone and was not there when he got back.

Somehow she's learned her destiny and that it's tied to kvothe. I think she's trying to save him or stop him(betray him). Practically the first thing she does is try to get him to not go to the university(his destiny). It could explain why she cried when he played the lute the first time, up till then she wasn't sure who he was, had possiblly fallen for him and realised it was him and that she must betray him. Would also explain why she sometimes keep distant from him, although what does bug me is when she seems to get jealous, like the end of AWMF. I've got another idea floating around my head about her protecting kvothe from the patron.

I think Kvothe and her are different sides of the same coin, both unknowingly being manipulated.

Back to the Cthaeh, 1 last thing, when scarpy was telling the story of the formation of the amir, one of the amir asked about stopping events before they happen, the Cthaeh would be handy for that and we know its up to no good and the amir have been known to do pretty extreme things.

If so, please direct me to the discussion.  Thanks!  Also, spoilers!

First, related to Kote, Bast, and the relationship between them.  There is a strong suggestion (sometimes explicit) that Bast views Kote as a teacher.  I don't have tNotW in front of me, but I think at one point Kote introduces Bast as his student.  But what could Kote be teaching Bast?  Bast is a Faerie, 150+ years old, and clearly possesses magical powers.  Bast obviously idolizes Kote, or at least Kvothe, but that doesn't explain why Kote would take on Bast as an apprentice.

Moving past the initial reasoning behind the arrangement, what is the manner of instruction.  As far as I can remember, Kote hasn't taught Bast anything in the framing story.  Crucially, however, I recall numerous times in that book (and I think once in tWMF) when Kote asks Bast to read *Celum Tinture*.  What is that book?  In tWMF chapter 143 we learn that it is a book about alchemy.  Isn't it curious that Kote's only overt attempts at 'teaching' Bast are centered around a subject that he continually claims to be very poor at?  Could it be that the copy of *Celum Tinture* that Kote is trying to get Bast to read actually has some other information in it?  Information that Kote cannot access/remember in his current state.  Or maybe it uses some of that magic Denna alludes to that is based on written things creating truth?  I don't know, but I suspect that that copy of *Celum Tinture* will become relevant.

Second, related to the Amyr, Cthaeh, and Maer Alveron.  During Kvothe's interaction with the Cthaeh, it says:

&gt;Not many folk will take your search for the Amyr seriously, you realize.  The Maer however is quite the extraordinary man.  He's already come close to them, though he doesn't realize it.  Stick by the Maer and he will lead you to their door.

&gt;Blood, bracken, and bone, I wish you creatures had the wit to appreciate me.  Whatever else you might forget, remember what I just said.  Eventually you'll get the joke.  I guarantee.  You'll laugh when the time comes.

I've read a number of theories that focus on the word 'stick', suggesting that this is a pun on the fact that Bredon has a walking stick.  I've read others that talk about how by showing Kvothe the Lackless's secret box, Alveron may have led Kvothe to a significant door (whether it guards/holds Iax, the Fae, the Moon's name, whatever).  I've read none that point out the following: Amyr and Maer are very similar sounding words.  I'm not sure what the implications of this are.  Maybe the Maer will become Amyr.  Maybe the Amyr are using the Maer.  Maybe the name 'Alveron' is similar to the name of an Amyr.  I don't know.

One of the things I like most about this series is Kvothe as an unreliable narrator. We never know what he embellishes or makes up, or what he hides from us. It's my hope that some of this will come out in the third book (I had hoped for it in the second in vain, apparently) and we will see a part he didn't tell us or lied or something. 

Now it seems very likely that the story may end with his story-telling ending. Oh, and maybe he gets his abilities back in the frame. But then what? Will there be enough room in the book to talk about everything? He still needs to master all his naming, meet Bast, something happen with Denna, kill a king, etc etc. My greatest fear is this book with end with him getting his powers back, and that would be the most unfulfilled ending I could imagine... If anyone can make me like that it would be Rothfuss, but still.

In the Name of the Wind, Kvothe travels to Trebon chasing rumors of the Chandrian, but finds everyone of the wedding party dead, except Denna. It's during this event that Kvothe names her mystery patron, who is very secretive, Master Ash.

In Vintas, Denna sings a song to Kvothe about Lanre and the Chandrian painting them in a sympathetic light, saying her patron wanted a song to last the ages.

Almost immediately after that, Kvothe is sent to dispatch a group of bandits lead by Cinder.

Doing a re-read and got caught up in the chest again, just like I always do. Got me thinking to what the hell could be in a thrice-locked chest that weighs a few hundred pounds when empty?

The mere fact that Kote can't open it says a lot to me. But, the chest was crafted by his own hands, meaning he knows *how* to open it, but can't. Judging from Chapter 151 in WMF, I believe it's safe to assume that Kote knows (or thinks he knows) how to open the chest. He knows where the two physical keys are and how to place them. The last lock is the one that won't budge. So, either he's lost the last key (being something along the lines of sympathy and naming) or he thought ahead and constructed it so that even he himself wouldn't be able to open it. There are other options, which I've entertained-someone switched it with a fake chest, it's actually just for show-but those seem pretty useless.

In any case, what's so important that Kvothe would have to hide it, possibly even from himself? Here are my thoughts:

1. It's his name, the one he received from Magwyn--""Maedre"". We know that it's possible (at least in stories) to seal a name in a box and have control of it.
2. He keeps his other name in the box -- ""Kvothe"". Can you dissect a name? Maybe he hid part of it or maybe he hid it all and simply adopted a new one (""Kote"" meaning 'disaster' in Siaru) to reflect his past actions?
3. His sleeping mind. Dunno if it's possible to lock the chest without naming, but it could be possible. Doing such would limit all forms of naming that he had, up until that point, possessed.

I've got some other ideas floating around in my head, but overall, those seem to be the strongest of the lot. Any thoughts?

During a discussion around the beginning of 2013 it was revealed that the first printing of the trade paperback of *The Wise Man's Fear* was slightly different from all other versions, including subsequent TP printings.  The mass market paperback came out recently and the 1st printing appears to be identical to the 1st TP.


I'm interested in identifying the differences, but it's the kind of thing that's much easier to do with the aid of a crowd.  I'm starting with something simple, like the chapter titles.  If anyone's willing to check their copy and confirm whether it conforms, I'd appreciate it.  And maybe six or seven other geeks would, too.  The Spanish edition appears to contain the same (translated) differences as the two odd American English printings.

Printings:

HC - confirmed

Kindle - confirmed 

MMPB (1st) - confirmed

MMPB (2nd on) - unavailable

ARC - as posted on the during the [Rothfuss Reread](http://www.tor.com/features/series/patrick-rothfuss-reread)

Chapter titles are identical except for: 


**103** - *Close Enough to Touch* (HC, Kindle, TP 2nd on)

**124** - *Of Names* (HC, Kindle)^1

**124** - *Secrets and Mysteries* (MMPB 1st)^1

-

The ARC is identical until Chapter 96, at which point several chapters appear to be combined, some under different titles, ultimately realigning with the others at 119 with *When Words Fail*, which is Chapter 121 in all other versions. Jo began using the Kindle version around that point, though, and I'm somewhat confused about whether the information after that is entirely accurate.

And then I noticed this while rereading Wise Man's Fear the other day:

WMF (chapter 102)

&gt;*Felurian’s eyes were black in the dim light. “the moon has our two worlds beguiled, like parents clutching at a child, pulling at her, to and fro, neither willing to let go.”*
&gt;
&gt;*She stepped away, and we stood as far apart as we could, the stone gripped in our hands. “when she is torn, half in your sky, you see how far apart we lie.” Felurian reached toward me with her free hand making futile grasping gestures in the empty water. “no matter how we long to kiss, the space between us is not ripe for this.”*
&gt;
&gt;*Felurian stepped forward and pressed the stone close to my chest. “and when your moon is waxing full, all of faerie feels the pull. she draws us close to you, so bright. and now a visit for a night is easier than walking through a door or stepping off a ship that’s near the shore.” She smiled at me.“ ’twas thus while wandering in the wild, you found Felurian, manling child.”*
&gt;
&gt;*The thought of an entire world of fae creatures drawn close by the swelling moon was troubling. “And this is true of any fae?”*
&gt;
&gt;*She shrugged and nodded. “have they the will, and know the way. there are a thousand half-cracked doors that lead between my world and yours.”*
&gt;
&gt;*“How have I never heard of this? It seems it would be hard to miss, Fae dancing on the mortal grass. . . .”*
&gt;
&gt;*She laughed. “but has not just this come to pass? the world is wide and time is long, but still you say you heard my song before you saw me singing there, brushing moonlight through my hair.”*
&gt;
&gt;*I frowned. “Still, it seems I should have seen more signs of those who walk between.”*
&gt;
&gt;*Felurian shrugged. “most fae are sly and subtle folk who step as soft as chimney smoke. some go among your kind enshaedn*, **glamoured as a pack mule laden**, *or wearing gowns to fit a queen.” She gave me a frank look. “we know enough to not be seen.”*


So.  Tinkers = Faen?

What other fantasy books are there - in a similar vein to the KKC books? I've heard 'The Blade Itself' is meant to be rather good. Is it as immediately captivating as Rosthfuss' books?

It made me wonder, what was the plan there? Why was Cinder leading a group of bandits at all, not just bandits but well trained mercenary men rather then poor bandits who just need the money - what was the Chandrian's plan here? 

Was it because, as the Cthaeh said, the Maer got closer then he realises and they need to do something to distract him from coming across the truth? Or was it just to spead some chaos?


The other thing was the leader (Cinder) disappeared. He looked up at the sky, ran into his tent and then disappeared. Was this was due to Marten who was muttering prayers to Tehlu etc because of the magic that Kvothe was doing (using the dead bandit to create a link to other bandits and then stabbing him, blood everywhere etc).

So Marten is praying heavily and with full belief and emotion in each word. He pulls the attention of the Leader with those words that you would assume - even with us knowing he is Cinder - the Leader shouldn't be able to hear over the storm from that distance.

The Leader then looks up at the sky and disappears into his tent - this seems very much like when the Chandrian killed  Kvothes family and were taunting him when suddenly Haliax looks up gathers his group around him and they all disappear together. 

So did Martins prayers call the Amyr to that place and cause Cinder to leg it? The Amyr are not human and are more angel like then human so maybe they can hear a man's prayers when they are full of that much conviction and then decided to check it out?
&gt;The Ruach who agree to accept Aleph's mantle are then touched by him and become wha t appear to be angels, gaining wings and being lit up by a white holy flame.

Anyway, one last chance to get out before you read spoilers.






LAST CHANCE







Alright, just being safe. Does anyone have any ideas about it? I thought Pat said the story would be about Bast, and I guess it could be if he was the Holly, since the descriptions are so vague. At the same time, have we ever seen his hands described? Old Holly's hands are described as being rough and covered in bark (duh, he's a tree).

Other thoughts?

* The girl gives off a very Denna like feel to me. If it is Denna, then this could mean Denna's a Chandrian/something wholly different? After all, as the intro states, it covers ""a vast scope of time"".

* If Denna isn't a Chandrian/Amyr, then could this woman be the one that first came to know the unasked for touch of men?

* Going off of how vast the time is, along with the villains, it seems like the story takes place in a bastion during the time of the creation war. The way it's told reminds me of how the fae (or at least felurian) speak in rhymes.

* The beasts that come make me think of the terrible things that could be done by naming instead of knowing. Change the name, change it into a horrible, bent creature.

* The smoke in the distance made me think of Myr Tariniel when it was finally betrayed.

* Could the shadow bent to look like a man be a skin walker? Doubtful, but just throwing out ideas.

* Is this just a folk story of how fae and other creatures came to be weakened by Holly? Old Holly destroyed their ancestors and the weakness was passed down somehow?

* Finally, *bum bum bum* could this be the tree the Cthaeh is resting in? I don't want to believe it since Old Holly seems innately good, and I'm sure Pat would've described it if it were as unique as a Holly tree (the blood-red berries, spiked leaves), but who knows.

Any other thoughts? I saw in the other thread one or two people were disappointed in it. I am a little bit, simply because I expected a first or third person story about Bast, but I also love it. The writing reminds me of Beowulf/other epics, and sometimes the stories with the least details are the ones that hold the most mystique and are the most memorable.

One question regarding the Amyr that is, thus far, left unanswered by the novels is how the Amyr police each other. For example, what is to prevent an Amyr who has become corrupted from running amok committing atrocities?

Rothfuss mentions in a recent video (http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=ptmXe023sJM#t=1822s) that this is an important question in Book 3 and the answer gets to the true root of the origin of the Amyr.

This brought to mind a theory that perhaps Lanre is the first of the Amyr. His burning of Myr Tariniel, he believed, was ""for the greater good."" He believed that man was so corrupt that the only way to purify the planet was to destroy mankind, which seems like the unwavering judgement of the Amyr taken to an extreme level.

-The Cthaeh smells iron on K and deduces that he is Felurian's new manling and wonders how Felurian can stand it

-K holds an iron drab up to the scraeling and it cracks while making a hissing sound.

-K uses an iron pipe to fight the scraeling, presumably indicating they are faen creatures and possibly not what is released from behind the doors of stone. Unless of course the Doors of Stone are Waystones... But I will leave that for someone else to post speculations about.

-K makes up a story about Chronicler saying ""And more important, he knows Chronicler can't control you if you have your name hidden away somewhere safe. The high king's name is written in a book of glass, hidden in a box of copper. And that box is locked away in a great iron chest where nobody can touch it.""

-A black iron box to hold part of the moon's name

-Kvothe the Bloodless wears a ring of iron on his first hand; I presume the right because the other rings are amber, wood, and bone, which correspond to rings given to him in Vintas. BUT of course, K did sell his rings before leaving Vint, so who knows. And the left hand of course is where rings are worn if you have mastery over that thing. On his second hand ""One was blood in a flowing band. One of air all whisper thin, And the ring of ice had a flaw within. Full faintly shone the ring of flame, And the final ring was without name.""

-The Adem have iron stoves &gt; most likely irrelevant but still in the text

-Trivial again, but in Scarpi's story Selitos is quoted as saying ""I can kill you,"" Selitos said, then looked away from Lanre's expression suddenly hopeful. ""For an hour, or a day. But you would return, pulled like iron to a loden-stone.

-Draccus scales have iron in them, proved to us when the scale reacts to the loden stone that K has

-K and Bast shortly discuss how iron would not have an effect on a shapechanger. I don't remember much about this sequence, but I saw someone mention it somewhere else so I will include it.

-Graham the cooper shows up with three new barrels bound with brass instead of iron for K. It is speculated that this is done with Bast in mind.

Ok now on to the meat!
We will wrap this post up by talking about the Chandrian and how iron relates to them. I propose that it could very likely be that some of, if not all, the Chandrian could be Faen. Hell why not right? You've heard crazier I'm sure.

Stercus is in thrall of iron. (a slave to iron)
I think this could be a pretty clear indicator that little Stercus here is a Faen creature. That or it is simply his sign and nothing else.

Ferule chill and dark of eye.
Is it odd that Ferule (Cinder) is the only Chandrian with two symbols mentioned? (CHILL and DARK OF EYE) Is he special? Is he second in command within the Chandrian (doubtful)? Does this mean he is cold? Pale skin? Cold hearted? Dark of eye makes me think that his eyes are just large pupils, which makes me think of demonic like creatures or possibly how I imagine some Faen creatures. I won't rattle on about the Fae here, so just take this point at face value.
And let’s not forget the chemical element iron is repressed by the symbol ""Fe"" &gt; FErule. *Cringes* that’s a stretch... But is it really? Names are very important right? I've read that a ferule is a type of cane or stick, which lends some credence to many people's Bredon/ Cinder/ Ash theory. But that is another topic entirely.

Usnea lives in nothing but decay. (rust?)
Is this the Chandrian that causes rusting, or is that Stercus? Hmmm interesting. We don't really know which Chandrian causes each individual sign, aside from the obvious Cyphus - blue flame, Ferule - dark eye, Grey Dalcenti - never speaks (*Cough* K kills Denna's patron, a Chandrian, and become a Chandrian himself and thus locks his name in a thrice locked chest to avert certain disaster and inherits his silence *cough*) Now there's a new post for someone...

Alright, so that was a lot to take in for one post and I have typed far more than I thought I would for a simple post about iron (and stuff), so I will stop here before I ramble on any further.

Interesting talk on silver and a possible third realm may come in another post later on here SOON...

Are the scrael fean creatures?

Are some or all the Chandrian Fean?

Is Cinder Ash? Is Bredon Ash? Is Ash Ash???

Does K kill Grey Dalcenti and take his sign of silence whaaaaa?!

Is Silver important?! No wait, we will save that for a later date...

So I'm going to explain it. If this ISN'T a new idea, and you've all heard it before, please ignore me.

Alright, so here's what we know (lots of spoilers): Kote has changed his name from Kvothe, he's no longer able to control his abilities, and he's just not quite the same of a fighter (to put it lightly). He doesn't have Denna, and the world's gone crazy (presumably because of the Fae). But he does have Bast, a strange Fae child who really wants him to be back to his old self, and seems to care a lot for Kvothe.
In addition (and more importantly) we know that Denna made Kvothe swear on his name and his good (right, I believe) hand that he would be hers.

And then he went to the Fae and slept with Felurian (a lot).

The way I see it going down, and what really makes it a tragedy, is that somehow Kvothe takes Denna to the Fae, because he's promised Felurian he would go back but he's definitely in love with Denna.
I think they get there, and Felurian has had a child (Bast, Kvothe's child). In this situation, Felurian, being as emotional and protective as she is, sees Denna as a threat, and perhaps even moreso now that she has a son with this man. But Denna, simultaneously, sees Kvothe as having broken his word.
Felurian attacks Denna, Kvothe kills her (probably through a lack of control of his abilities, like when he almost killed Felurian that last time). Denna tells him he broke his oath, and he loses his true name and his good hand (meaning he can no longer play or properly perform any of his abilities). So he loses both the women, and is stuck with a Fae child that he doesn't know what to do with.

Here's the problem that I'm having, though: two separate narrators have narrated the book.  The reviews on Audible.com are more or less the same.  One was narrated by [Nick Podehl](http://www.audible.com/pd/ref=sr_1_1?asin=B002UZMLXM&amp;qid=1355381527&amp;sr=1-1), and was released on 15 May, 2009, and the other narrated by [Rupert Degas](http://www.audible.com/pd/ref=sr_1_2?asin=B007FGE4EU&amp;qid=1355381527&amp;sr=1-2), and was released on the 6th of March, 2012.  

The reviews for both of these on audible seem to be speaking mainly of the book.  I'd really like to get the best experience possible, so does anybody know which one is a better narrator? Has anyone listened to either or both, that can speak to the quality of the narration?

Sadly Pat is a busy man, and he hasn't yet answered our e-mail, but that is nothing that will hinder us. We did want his blessing before we start, and possibly him naming it, but what can a Cealdish man do when the going is tight, just bare his beard and go on hopping for the bast, that's what.  

As for the rest, well with low application numbers (only tree :[ ) we did hit gold. I have only one more talk with the last application, and if that goes well, and we don't get any more applications until the 28 we will have a nice four man video-cast crew. But we are still in application mode so send them in if you want. And we will be open to have guests down the line, even having a rotating crew of talkers.

Now onto the podcast, the first episode, the one that introduces us and what we are aiming to achieve(fun, fan love, theories and a outrageous will to pick apart this lovely world of Pats) we will be using a fraps filming set up, with x-split for the set up of the web cams. Some sound editing to make it go more smoothly and a free amount of video edits so the podcast will have fun features (like a sometimes rotating background to make notice of the subject or theory we are taking apart or creating). We did have a few ideas about subjects and other fan interaction, but more on that after the 28.

Now onto the name...
This was a strange thing, we are not namers, nor shapers, but we did come up with something, it is still a working title, and we need feedback from you on it, or even if you have any suggestions of your own post them in the comments and lets see what we can brow up.

A part of me replies with faith in Rothfuss while another offers a more tempting theory.

I know Kote says he needs three whole days to say his story, but what if he gets interrupted and the story has to be go on for another day? I've got a couple ideas on what might stop Kote from finishing.

* I think I might have read this somewhere in this subreddit. Kote's been mentioning the Chandrian quite a lot in the past two days, what if they come knocking? Some people argue that he hasn't said their true names yet and has only referred to them as Cinder, Haliax and such. But you forget the poem! (Refer to note1) I believe the names in that poem are their true names and having mentioned it in his narration, Kote has to have spoken it in the present.

* What if somehow Kvothe awakens mid story? There are bunch of theories of how he awakens floating around; from Bast opening the chest, to Kote hearing some moving music. His awakening could delay things a number of ways, Kvothe realizes he still has unfinished business and heads to [insert important location], or he doesn't want o finish the story any more and has to be convinced otherwise. Heck, he could even bring Bast and Lochees with him and attempt to finish the story while travelling. 

* More demons attack. We've seen attacks by Scrael and a possessed Mercenary, so its not that unlikely that we see some more. What if the whole of Newarre gets attacked? Houses burn, people die, something like this could heavily change the course of the book. Hell, this could even be the moment Kvothe awakens.

*If any of you have thought of this possibility feel free to share any theories of my own. Or go with the masses and tear mine apart.

I know some of you might find this crazy, and it probably is, but my mind needs some way to cope with Kvothe's story coming to an end.

1. Rich, deep world, with a lot of history. It really seems to be alive and breathing, just like Kvothe's world. 
2. Main character is so entertaining. As the story progresses, he becomes a better wizard, but his keen mind and sharp wit are his real strengths. 
3. Fantastic story. Wizards vs Vampires, with Fae, demons, Fallen Angels, and ""The Outsiders"" playing secondary roles.
4. [Very slight spoiler](/s ""Main character bribes Pixies with Pizza"")
5. Fantastic voice acting in the audio book. The whole series is narrated by James Marsterson. The guy really breathes life into the voices.

**Cons:**

1. There are a few moments that are a tad too religious for my taste. The main character is an Athiest, but angels and demons start to play a bigger role as the story progresses. It's all tolerable if you're not into that kind of thing though (which I'm not).

I have a new topic about Master Ash for you all.  

Why does Denna stay with him, despite the beatings?  She can learn music from other people.  Some other patron wouldn't beat her.  But she stays, when normally she runs from other men.  Despite gifts, despite offers of safety, or learning, or money.    

I saw the Drugs and women post, and commented there, but I felt it could be it's own topic.  

My new theory to present today is that she has become or is starting to become a denner addict.  Her only real source of it is Master Ash, and she's too proud/ashamed to reveal that she kept taking it after the Treborn incident to anyone else.  Why else would she stay with a man who beats her, plus, why would she let him do such?  She runs from any man who tries to get grabby, she keeps Kvothe at a harsh distance at the end of WMF.  So I think it's possible that perhaps she has the addict's issue, and allows all of that, because she is chemically stuck to M. Ash due to Denner resin.

(quotes in italics)

**Tl;dr: We’ve seen three notable swords in the KKC so far: Folly, Cinder’s sword, and Caesura. Folly is probably one of the other two, but which one? Why is it renamed? Was the name inspired by Ben’s note in Rhetoric and Logic? Does this mean it’s directly related to why Kvothe is in hiding?**  

Read more for quoted descriptions of each sword and more analysis, especially about the point with the Adem and Kvothe’s responsibilities to them with their sword.  


We see a few notable swords in tNotW. In the beginning, we are introduced to the sword Folly. It is hung behind the bar of Kote’s inn. Later, we see Cinder’s sword. While in Ademre during WMF, Kvothe obtains Caesura.  

**1)** Folly:  

*“It shone a dull grey-white in the room’s autumn light. It had the appearance of a new sword. It was not notched or rusted. There were no bright scratches skittering along its dull grey side. But though it was
unmarred, it was old. And while it was obviously a sword, it was not a familiar shape. At least no one in this town would have found it familiar. It looked as if an alchemist had distilled a dozen swords, and when the crucible had cooled this was lying in the bottom: a sword in its pure form. It was slender and graceful. It was deadly as a sharp stone beneath swift water…. Its grey-white metal shone against the dark roah behind it.”*  
	
**2)** Cinder’s sword:  

*“His sword was pale and elegant. When it moved, it cut the air with a brittle sound. It reminded me of the quiet that settles on the coldest days in winter when it hurts to breathe and everything is still… The one called Cinder sheathed his sword with the sound of a tree cracking under the weight of winter ice”.*  

**3)** Caesura:  

*“Then, slowly, she laid her hand on another sword with a blade of burnished grey. She lifted it off the wall,   gripped it, and seemed to age ten years… The guard of this one extended out slightly, curving to give a hint of   protection to the hand. It was nothing like a full hand guard. Anything that bulky would render half the Ketan   useless. But it looked as if it would give my fingers an extra bit of shelter, and that was appealing to me.”*  

**4)** At one of their interludes from Kvothe’s  story in WMF, Chronicler puts two-and-two together and realizes the sword hanging behind the bar of Kote’s inn, Folly, is Caesura. However, he points out it doesn’t match up with Kvothe’s description. And I quote:  

*“I can’t help notice that your description of Caesura doesn’t…” Chronicler hesitated. “Well, it doesn’t quite seem to match the actual sword itself.” His eyes flickered to the sword behind the bar. “The hand guard isn’t what you described.” [chop some unneeded things out]*  

*“You’re absolutely right.” [Kvothe] turned to look at the sword. “This isn’t… what did the boy call it this morning?” His eyes went distant for a moment, then he smiled again. “Kaysera. The poet killer.”*  

*“I was just curious,” Chronicler said apologetically.*  

*“Am I supposed to be offended that you’re paying attention?” Kvothe laughed again. “What fun is there in telling a story if nobody’s listening?”*  

**5)** Kvothe readily agrees that Folly, or the hilt at least, is different than the Caesura of the story. It’s possible that Kvothe had to change the hilt for some reason or another. But then another thought struck me: when he made the pact with the Adem, he was under contract to give the sword back when he died. At the present moment of the book, Kvothe has faked his death. He is, in effect, dead. In that case, Caesura should be back in Ademre. So then which sword is it? Did he make a duplicate Caesura, fashion the original hilt to the copy (to make it seem more authentic) and give the doppelganger back to Ademre to keep the true sword? Could it be he did return Caesura, and this is Cinder’s sword? Why name it Folly? We don’t know the name of Cinder’s sword, so although the description matches more closely with Caesura, it could be Cinder’s. On the other hand, Kvothe renamed himself Kote when he went into hiding. It’s possible he renamed the sword as well. One hint is in tNotW. In the copy of Rhetoric and Logic Ben leave him, it says:  

*“Defend yourself well at the University. Make me proud. Remember your father’s song. Be wary of folly.”*  

**6)** Ben was helping Arliden with the song about the Candrian. Could there be double meaning here? It seems odd Ben would warn against a sword, so it’s possible Kvothe took his message to heart and, when whatever happened to make him fake his death, decided it was due to this “folly” he failed to be wary of, and is somehow connected to the sword. Perhaps he accidentally kills someone with it that he shouldn’t have? Did something with the sword that directly relates to his current state of hiding? (I don’t want to say “he kills Denna” because it’s so over stated, but…. Yeah, that’s an option, too.)

Bast is faen but blends into human society, why couldn't the Faen Amry?

Brendon is thought to spend time at pagan gatherings around Waystones. (I believe I read this somewhere in the books or subreddit)
Brendon is refered to as Grandfatherly by Kvothe, possibly his grandfather there to negotiate the wedding for the Maer.

So one of my theories is that Brendon is of the Fae, and is actually a member of the Amry. 

The tak move of sacrificing a piece that wins Brendon could represent that the Amry will sacrifice much for an overall good out come. (for the greater good)

Those are my small theories. There is probably much evidence I've missed that will counter it all. Please leave a note :)

While my mind was occupied, I misplayed and we lost another hand, putting us down four in a row with a forfeit besides.

Manet glared at me while he gathered in the cards. ""Here's a primer for admissions."" He held up his hand, three fingers spearing angrily into the air. ""Let's say you have three spades in your hand, and there have been five spades laid down."" He held up his other hand, fingers splayed wide. ""How many spades is that, total?"" He leaned back in his chair, crossing his arms. ""Take your time.""



Then later in chapter 9 during his admissions interview:



Instead he held up three fingers dramatically. ""You have three spades in your hand,"" he said. ""And there have been five spades played."" He steepled his fingers and looked at me seriously. ""How many spades is that?"" 

""Eight spades."" I said.



After that the other masters show their disapproval, Elodin rebukes them for the mummers farce of admissions and asks a real naming question. I just thought that it was fun that Elodin asked him the same question that Manet had sarcastically asked while Kvothe was playing cards poorly.

1375938534.0,10,self.KingkillerChronicle,1jxrmx,(Spoilers all) The beautiful game...,12,2,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/KingkillerChronicle/comments/1jxrmx/spoilers_all_the_beautiful_game/,"So, I just got done reading the first two books of KKC for the first time, so forgive me if a lot of this has been touched upon already.

It already seems to be established that many people here believe that Bredon is one of the prime candidates to be Mr. Ash.  I myself fall into this camp.  He uses a cane (which the Cthaeh claims Denna is beaten with), he is rumored to be involved in ""pagan rituals"" in the forests of the Eld (where Kvothe &amp; Co. run into Cinder and his mercenaries), and his whole speech about playing a ""beautiful game""  hints that he is up to something far more grand than beating Kvothe in Tak.  If he is Mr. Ash though, the question I am asking is, what exactly is he playing at?

We first become suspicious of Mr. Ash when we realize that he summons Denna to witness the Chandrian attack on the wedding north of the University.  Next, we learn of his beating of Denna.  Lastly, we learn that he is instructing Denna to write a song praising Lanre rather than casting him as the villain that Kvothe believes him to be.  We can also infer that he is teaching Denna to use alternate forms of archaic magic in order to help spread his message.

Personally, I think that Bredon is an agent of the Chandrian.  As to what made him want to aid them, I cannot say, but I think it raises some very interesting questions.  

1)  Why would anybody want to aid a group of mythological murderers who seem to be hellbent on killing anybody who has any sort of real knowledge about them?  Pat doesn't seem like the kind of author to just write a character as being evil for the sake of being evil, so what could Bredon and the Chandrian possibly have in common?

2)  What makes Bredon so special that the Chandrian wouldn't kill him, too?  Arliden and his troupe were massacred for writing a simple song about the Chandrian, and the wedding on the Mauden farm was annihilated because they had a vase that had some slight imagery related to the Chandrian on it.  If Bredon has some inside knowledge of the Chandrian, why is he spared an allowed to help them when everybody else was simply killed off?

3) What role is Bredon preparing Denna to play in all of this?  Obviously, she is a great musical talent who attracts the attention of many men, both great and poor.  Is this enough, or is there something deeper to her that we do not know about?  Are the Chandrian using both Bredon and Denna to keep tabs on Kvothe, the one who got away?  Why not just kill him outright if that is the case?

Sorry for this being so long and rambling, but I am two days deep in my KKC withdrawal, and I need people to talk to about this.

In A Wise Man'a Fear Denna specifically asks about magic that when written down and someone saw it, even if they didn't understand it, it would become true for them.

At the end of A Wise Man's Fear, Kvothe has learned to read Yllish story knots, and sees that Denna has been writing words with her braid.

Armed with this knowledge, I have noticed throughout both books, Denna's braids are often mentioned. In some situations (for example after she plays her song for Kvothe in Vintas) it is mentioned that she combs out her braid, and then re-does the braid in a different pattern.

Could this be the secret things Denna's patron has been teaching her ""that no one else knows""?

Could Denna be enspelling Kvothe with this magic? That might explain why he (and every other man?) is so infatuated with her, especially given that Bast mentions she is actually somewhat unremarkable in appearance?

Could she have used this magic to bind Kvothe? Maybe he discovers this and they have a falling out - we saw how he reacted when Felurian tries to bind him.

[Probable Spoilers],10,2,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/KingkillerChronicle/comments/1eu0p2/anyone_have_any_theories_about_sympathy_probable/,"This is one of the biggest things I'm curious about in the series. We think we have a good understanding of the ""magic"" system - the sympathist holds the belief (Alar) that two objects are the same, speaks a sympathetic binding, and draws energy from a nearby source to affect whatever change he's going for. It's all very tidily explained, and for a while we forget to question it. Or at least I did.

But now some questions about sympathy have occurred to me, and I'm starting to doubt that we really understand the nature of sympathy at all. This goes for the other disciplines of ""magic"" taught at the University as well, particularly artificing since it's the only other discipline we know much about and it's very similar to sympathy anyway.

For example, what's the deal with these sympathetic bindings? What language are they in, or are they a language of their own? Who discovered them, and when? What gives them the power that they have? These questions also apply to the runes used in artificing.

What does Alar tell us about the Four Corners? The sympathist is basically tricking himself into believing something that shouldn't be true (if I move this twig, that one will move too), but if his will is strong enough he's actually tricking the world itself into believing it, too.

Glamoury is making something seem, and grammery is making something be.

The real world origin of ""grammar"" is to ""know one's letters"". Perhaps in this context we could extend that to mean ""knowing one's words"" or more specifically, know one's NAME.

If Sygaldry is like sympathy made physical, perhaps a gram is similarly one's name made physical through the use of sygaldry. A gram made with one's own blood and urine and such (per Kvothe's requests to the Maer) would know the name of the person for whom it is made in some significant sense.

If this is correct, maybe a gram was originally about setting a defense against Shapers. If a Shaper knew the name of a namer and sought to shape them into something other, a gram might remember that one's name for them and provide protection.

If that is also correct, then maybe that is why the grams are so uncomfortable for anyone else. What would have happened if Kvothe had kept a hold of Ben's gilder? Would it have ultimately renamed him? Would it have killed him at some point before the renaming was complete? Would it have transformed him in some unexpected way?

I was also thinking that maybe as the skill with naming seeped away, these other magics became the crutches of the Arcanists who could not name the elements they control. If an arcanist needed to work with stone but did not know its name, this might have spawned the need for the runes in the first place.

Perhaps sympathy is the closest some could get to naming at some point. If they didn't know the name of iron, they could at least bring their will to bear creating a link between similar items, thus creating a work around for some purposes...

As a bonus theory, might this be the means (either specifically or generally) that Kvothe's name is locked away in his box? Might the name of the moon be etched on whatever is in the Lockless Box...

1347099513.0,11,self.KingkillerChronicle,zjud2,A possible theory and history on The Doors of Stone (Spoilers),11,0,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/KingkillerChronicle/comments/zjud2/a_possible_theory_and_history_on_the_doors_of/,"In WMF, Felurian describes that in the beginning there had been two different types of people, Knowers and Shapers.  Namers, people who can look at a thing, and through study and deep knowing of it they could learn the name of it.  However they never claimed or ever tried to have mastery over any thing.

Shapers went beyond that, believing they could create mastery over a thing, and they did.  They were the ones who could take a things name and shape into something new.  By using this, they created a similarly mirrored but different version of the four corners, called the Fae realm.  I believe that Kelvin's oddities are remanents of that time.  Such various things as the ever burning lamp and warding stones, and blades such as Saicere, that's survived thousands of years even with constant use.  I believe the Shapers now reside in the world now known as the Faen Realm, and Namers in the ""real"" world.

Felurian goes on to describe that there had been friction between the two factions, but there had also been peace.  All hope of a lasting chance of peace between the Knowers and Shapers was lost at the stealing of the moon.  At this point the two worlds became truely seperate, since they no longer shared the same sky, and it sparked a war between the old Knowers and the newer Shapers.  I believe this was the beginning of the Creation War.

Skarpi describes the Creation war as lasting longer then even the life spans of the people of that time who lived and died in it could remember.  In Felurian's description of the time before the splitting of the worlds, the Faen people that are known in today's time didn't exist yet.  It's my thought that the Faen people and the creatures of it were created by the Shapers in the Fae Realm after the splitting of the worlds.

Waystones pop up speratically through-out the books, in thousands of random places.  I believe that they would have been created when the Moon fully resided in the four corners world, when it is closest to the four corner's world.  Through these gateways the Shapers were able to send their creations (also known as demons) into the ""real"" world, to wreck the havok, destruction and despair as described by Trapis in the story of Lanre.
  
In NotW, Trapis' story Lanre is described as standing alone against a great beast who's breath was darkness that smothered men, and while he dies in the process he succeeds in killing it.  The book then describes how the enemy beast was set beyond the doors of stone.  In WMF, the doors of stone is mentioned again, when Felurian says the stealer of the moon is locked beyond them.

There's much speculation on what the stone doors under the Arcanum lead too, as it has not yet said in the series what lies behind them.  Elodin describes the Arcanum in it's original form as a ""strong brandy"" of Namers, who created the school to teach the world about Naming.  As time went on it expanded into what it is at the current time, a ""well watered wine.""  I believe the stone doors Trapis and Felurian described are one in the same as the stone doors below the archives, and the Arcanum was built atop it to protect it and keep it unknown from the rest of the world.  And with Kvothe's obvious curiosity and uncanny ability at getting into things he shouldn't, I think he opens it.  This allowed for the current war, and the scrael raveging across the land in the process.

Spoilers within.,10,3,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/KingkillerChronicle/comments/wezxl/speculation_regarding_meluan_and_cinder_spoilers/,"So I've been listening to the audio books at work, after reading them a few times. It seems hearing all of the information actually said is letting me pick up on some things I missed before but seem pretty obvious thinking about now.

I haven't really read this subreddit much before (although after reading the front page I'm subscribed now), so forgive me if this has been posted already. 


Kovthe is Meluan Lackless' nephew. His mother used to be a noble before becoming a troupe, stolen away by his father's charm. As we all know Meluan's sister ran off with a Ruh leaving Meluan to hate and despise them. That part is rather obvious, but what I forgot from book 1 kind of solidifies it without a doubt for me. 

When Kvothe sings the children's rhyme he picked up in a town they passed through about the seven things in Lady Lackless' dress his mother overhears and becomes upset. He likens it to a play and his mother says there is a difference between a character in a play and a real person. To remember that Lady Lackless is a person with feelings that can be hurt. She has him go fetch some thing to make it up to both her and Lady Lackless. 

Also along the same vein is his first meeting with Meluan. He says that she looks very familiar, like he's met her before but can't remember where or how. Being that they're sisters, Meluan resembles his mother a great deal and after burying away his memories and having not seen her in such a long time he sees her as being familiar but doesn't identify her as looking like his mom. 

And of course, although not as compelling and with plenty of other explanations is the resemblance of his chest with the Lockless box. 


Now on to Cinder:

I have a feeling this has also been discussed, but I think Folly was Cinder's sword. The description given when they mount Folly and when Kvothe first encounters the Chandrian is very close. The mounting board also matches well with Cinder's black on black eyes, the black wood with the blackened letters seared in to become black on black. At some point in book three Kvothe will fight Cinder, kill him, and take his sword. Possibly at the fountain in Imre where the sandy-haired traveler says the stones were shattered and couldn't be mended. This also leads into Chronicler saying that some people speak of Kvothe being a new Chandrian - killing one and taking his place.

So I'd like to discuss what is hinted at, and revealed, in those two chapters.  

1st Chapter (104)
-The masters at the University know of the Chandrian.  But Kvothe will not ask, and they would not tell. 
-Haliax does not sleep.  Ever. 
-Kvothe would have to go to Stormwal to find anyone to even take him seriously in his quest.
-""Stick by the Maer, and he will lead you to their (the Amyr) door.""
That is somehow a joke, and Kvothe will realize it at some point. 
-Kvothe does not ask what scared away the Chandrian.
-Master Ash will eventually begin to permanently harm Denna, and she's tied to him tightly, no explanation as to why.  

2nd Chapter: (105)
-Bast knows that this might be why Kvothe is no longer himself
-There isn't anything worse than the Cthaeh, Bast states
-The flowers of the Cthaeh's tree, which it can't leave, cure any wound. 
-Other events involving the Cthaeh in the Corners:  The Fastingsway War, Iax (Jax) and the moon, Lanre and Myr Tariniel, The creation of the nameless, the Scaendyne 

(Does anyone have any other references to these events, other than Lanre and Jax? i.e. The Scaendyne, would they be related to the Scrael, as an example?)

The final lines in the chapter:  Kvothe:  ""This is not a dashing romance.  This is no fable where folk come back from the dead (is Denna dead, then?).   It's not a rousing epic meant to stir the blood.  No.  We all know what kind of story this is.""
-Then Kvothe calls them both ""young"".  Even though Bast is over 100 years old.  And Chronicler, as we guessed since he wrote the book ""Mating Habits of the Common Draccus"" likely long before Kvothe was in University, is also older than Kvothe....

We already know that he used Felurian's name, and when he saves Denna it doesn't sound like he is using the name of the wind.

*I laid one hand against her straining chest.  Her skin was flushed and hot.  Her heart was trilling like a frightened bird.  I laid my other hand along her face.  I looked deeply into her eyes.  They were like dark pools.
  I leaned close enough to kiss her.  She smelled of selas flower, of green grass, of road dust.  I felt her strain to breathe.  I listened.  I closed my eyes.  I heard the whisper of a name.
  I spoke it soft, but close enough to brush against her lips.  I spoke it quiet, but near enough so that the sound of it went twining through her hair.  I spoke it hard and firm and dark and sweet.*

When Kvothe hears the name he is concentrating on Denna; her smell, how she looks and feels.  He is not concentrating on making he breathe.

With the end of a centuries-long war culminating in the destruction of 7 of the 8 great cities still in existence at the time, it seems like it wouldn't be much of a surprise that the world was plunged into a millenia-long dark ages. What if the angels were created to help preserve civilization?

With their purpose being partly to bring justice they might be guides sent periodically to bring the world back to civilization more quickly than they would have otherwise been able to manage on their own.

With Kvothe and Devi having such an incredible draw toward the archives, maybe part of their purpose is preserving information and helping to restore the knowledge that had been lost.

Depending on the interpretation of Scarpi's story of the creation of the angels, the layout of the Mews might be related, with ""wings"" extending in eight directions like a compass rose. I'm uncertain of what it's importance might be, but I looked up mews and it was a place for housing hawks. I could see that being significant as well if this isn't just me reading too much into things.

I'm also working on changing my mind about Kvothe being Tehlu. I'm thinking perhaps he is Anden, whose name means ""anger"". I'll be editing my original post with my reasons in the next few days, but with all the imagery of fire and anger about both of them the gist of it should be fairly clear I hope. :)

I think my favorite little recurring metaphor in the series is the metaphor of Ramston steel in regards to Kvothe's alar. 

He is constantly referring to it (half in jest, most times) as ""razor sharp like Ramston steel"", but drops in almost equal measure the qualifier that Ramston steel is super sharp and keeps its edge, but is extra brittle for all that shear potential. 

This comes to a head at the end of The Name of the Wind when at final little battle against the sort of dead guy happens. One of the broken bottles is filled with strawberry wine, reminding Kvothe of drinking it with Denna. He attempts some sympathy with it, and can't do it. It's unclear if he can do it without the reminder of Denna, but the smell of the strawberry wine causes some distress in him. 

What does this tell us about Denna? Something bad, no doubt. My guess is that she gets caught in the crossfire of Kvothe's future shittiness and gets killed, snapping that ""alar like Ramston steel"" like so much brittle metal. 

Not new or hidden or insightful, but something that makes me smile every time it pops up. I love the idea that Kvothe will just get better and better and better (as fits the education motif) and then a major part of his power will just snap.

Recently, Patrick Rothfuss did an interview ( http://herocomplex.latimes.com/2012/03/28/patrick-rothfuss-fantasy-needs-to-move-past-dragons-and-dwarves/ ) in which he propagated his opinion that the tropes, or clichés, of the fantasy world are bogging down the fantasy genre. He believes that fantasy writers need to get out from tree-dwelling elves and monstrous dragons. Now, we all know that Rothfuss is something very fresh in the scene and his spin on dragons was great. 

However, in the interview, there was something that caught my eye. Rothfuss says that the fantasy genre also needs to drop the whole Chosen One thing. This possibly hypocritical statement opens two sides to what should be an important debate around Kvothe, and what could turn several theories on their head. 

Let's be honest, Kvothe pretty much becomes God's gift to everything he does. Abenthy sums it up without even seeing him grow up, by saying that if he stayed with the troupe, he'd be the next Ilien. Were he to become a merchant, he would own half the world. As we follow his story, he passes quickly through the ranks of the university, trains with the Adem, masters a language all on his search to find the Chandrian and the Amyr... Then we find hints that he may be the son of Meluan Lackless' sister, a woman he meets through incredible circumstances. The rivalry between Kvothe and Ambrose, which prevents his patronage, which leads to Threpe sending him off to meet the Maer, who needs help wooing Kvothe's possible aunt... Who just so happens to own a mysterious door that may or may not have something to do with the Amyr? 

Is Kvothe fated to follow this path? While there is no Trelawney to prophesy this whole 'chosen one' thing, one cannot deny that there are so many coincidences in this book. So was Rothfuss breaking his own set of fantasy rules? Or is he following them? Which would mean much of what our theories are based on could simply be red herrings.

Instead, it's a thought that occurred to me about style and theme.

I think we can all agree that a major element of the story, and of Kvothe's personality specifically, is music as storytelling, and storytelling as music.  I think that the format he uses for the prologue and epilogue of each story is a continuation of that theme.

For one, there's simply the fantastic tune and lilt to the words themselves.  In a book that the author has quite clearly scrutinized to an absurd degree, these pages are some of the most beautiful writing, basically prose poems.

Past that, though, is how they are repeated.  Each time, the format is the same.  The paragraphs are the same, they start the same, and the have (approximately, I haven't counted) the same amount of words and lines.  However, within the rigid structure of the page, there is variance, there is a different story each time, there are different analogies and descriptions.

What does this remind me of?  A song, played live, by a creative artist.  I've seen some of my favorite bands play quite a few times; sometimes they play the same songs, which are still fundamentally the same, and each time, it sounds different.  The prologues and epilogues are performances, variations on the same central song.

You can never lose a fight following a moral code, because in the end you always do the right thing, and no matter the outcome, you don't lose. Morality is a gut reaction, it comes from the same place laughter does, in a sense. Morality can't be taught but it can be ingrained, it can be understood, and it can be recognized. Living properly and with honor would fall under the umbrella of moral living.

As of right now they are fairly rough things, just what I noticed, wanted to get your takes on them

1) The children's song about the chandrian obviously has a variety of verses, and every time it is mentioned it has different verses, but it always end's similiarly. [Version 1](/s ""The first, and i think more common version ends with ""See a man without a face, move like ghosts from place to place, what's their plan, what's their plan, Chandrian Chandrian"", this fairly obviously refers to haliax/Lanre, as his face is always cloaked in shadow and noone can see him"")

However, the second version is slightly different in it's ending [Version 2](/s ""when kvothe goes to investigate the wedding party that was destroyed, when he finally realizes that it was the chandrian, he and denna have a moment of realization and say the rhyme.  In this version the ending is ""See a woman pale as snow? silent come and silent go.  What's their plan what's their plan, chandrian, chandrian"".  Is it possible this could refer to lyra?  Lyra is never physically described, at least to my knowledge.  Is it possible lyra is still ""alive"", but lost because of her and lanre's love? Similiar to the way she was able to bring lanre back to life after the giant battle.  Could the Chandrian really be searching for lyra?  If this is the case, would lyra maybe go wherever she hears clues of the chandrian, but when the chandrian arrive she has already gone, prompting them to destroy everything?"")


Theory #2

After they find the draccus, denna and kvothe find a lookout for someone harvesting denner resin [Spoiler](/s ""Denna ingests a small amount of resin and at the beginning of her drug induced state kvothe mentions abenthy and says ""he was an arcanist, which means it's pretty much his job to notice things""  to which denna replies ""well it's my job to notice things about you"".  Seeing as how it is a pretty well known theory that ""master ash"" could very well actually be cinder, and that denna continues to show up and the damndest places where kvothe is, and this trend continues into WMF do you think it could be possible that cinder or perhaps the chandrian as a whole remember kvothe and want to keep an eye on him?  Perhaps they know he has been looking into them but haliax does not deem it worthy to kill him so cinder is trying to keep an eye on him?  Could it be cinder working on his own, as cinder and kvothe have a history from when kvothe's parents were killed? "")

**The men who attacked Kvothe were not sent by Ambrose**

One of them mentioned having just come from a job in Anilin, where Denna had been going before coming to Imre. She also mentioned some unpleasantness while she was there. I wonder if those men weren't after Kvothe at all but were hunting down people who got close to Denna, possibly one of the men she's been seeing found Kvothe's hair on her clothes and sent them out of jealousy. Ambrose never takes credit for them and Sleat neither confirms nor denies hiring them out. 

**Caudecus is a member of Order Amyr**

and the Maer's research into the Amyr was Caudecus' real reason for poisoning him and the Cthaeh hinted that he had come into close contact with them and not known it. Also, Caudecus isn't dead. When the Maer's men burned him out, they assumed he was dead and informed the Maer that they had dealt with him. I'm willing to bet though, they didn't find a body. What's more, I believe that the Lackless door is directly connected with Amyr which would explain the Cthaeh's joke.

**Bredon is Faen**

I first suspected this when i heard him use a peculiar phrase that only Bast had said up until then. ""It is a freely given gift without obligation let or lien."" Also, Tak is a game only Bredon and Felurian have known how to play so far. It's possible that it is a Fae game and the object of it certainly seems in line with the way Fae people seem to think. I thought that Bredon may actually BE Bast but there's not enough support for that yet.

No, seriously. Kvothe is in Kote's thrice locked chest. 

Kvothe says he has an Alar ""like a blade of Ramston steel."" Ramston Steel is known to be brittle, with the tinker Kvothe meets in WMF describing a knife made from it as ""the best knife you'll ever have until it breaks.""

So, Kvothe needed to hide, or get away, and he as out of ideas and out of time. So he did the only thing he could. He shattered his Alar, breaking his mind in to two separate pieces, like he did when practising the Heart of Stone, but much more severe. He takes the Kvothe part, and seals it in the chest, and with it his magic and music, the two skills he prized above all others, or perhaps the two he held dearest, or were most tied in with his personality. 

Of course, the chest was designed by Kvothe. And, no longer being Kvothe, he can't open it. He can do some Sympathy, but only by accident, when his sleeping mind calls on it, much like Kvothe could call Names with his sleeping mind.

It would just leave to much undone. There is a war going on that Kvothe blames himself for at the very least, cant begin to say much else without knowing what gets resolved in the third book.

I think ultimately it will be 9 books long, a trilogy of trilogies if you will. The first 3 being the introduction, the next 3 of Kvothe becoming himself again, and the final 3 either everything coming together or going to hell but ending either way.

I have seen a lot of reference to Denna's sponsor being an Amyr as well as how Denna's family was killed by the Amyr.
Where is that in the books? Is there much support for it? I understand they are a possibility, but some people in this subreddit seem to think it is fact. I was wondering if I missed something.

Here is my small contribution to the theories surrounding the books and please bear with me if these are common well hashed out ideas.

Does Bredon from Vintas not seem like a very credible character as a secret member of the Amyr organization? He is a noble who stands apart from the others. He is rumored to have strange ritual ceremonies on his land. Also the tree mentions that Kvothe should stay close to the King to find the Amyr (I think it was the tree that said that...).

I also have a strong believe that Kvothe actually changed his Name to Kote and not just his regular name. That is based on him talking to Elodin about Denna and asking what he thinks of a girl who often is changing her name. Elodin grabs him and says he must never do that near the end of WMF.

First, Immediately after being brought on the horns for the first time, Brandeur and Hemme are talking and get cut off.  This line from Brandeur, after asking why Hemme wasn't wearing a gram, struck me as a bit excessive:

&gt; ""We should all take precautions."" Brandeur said, placatingly.  ""You know as well as-"" their voices were cut off with the sound of a door closing.

Now while being somewhat known figures who likely make enemies out of students regularly could make them targets, especially considering the forces they meddle with, I doubt any student, even of say Devi's caliber, would be capable of causing serious injury to any of them in the relatively brief window between them realizing they're being targetted and getting to a gram.

This leads me to think that Branduer is talking about more than just carrying a gram when he mentions ""precautions"".  What he's referring to, I'm not sure.  Perhaps something Copper.

The other thing that caught me but probably isn't as significant is the parallel of the Old Madman who teaches the Young Hero to slay evil (or something along those lines).  Not the one where Elodin is the Madman, that's a bit too obvious I think.  The book even calls it out.  I think a better one is Auri, as she pretty explicitly gives Kvothe the same 3 things that Taborlin was fabled to carry, his tools if you will.

That's all for now, just some food for thought.  I'd love to hear any ideas built off these, or including them if you have them.  The Auri's importance and Taborlin's tools have been mentioned before, but I haven't seen this bit from Brandeur mentioned yet.

So lots of people here think that Kvothe changed his name to Kote and hence changed himself and lost all his amazing skills that we've been hearing about. I definitely buy into this theory, but I'd like to add this as another less likely option.

Let's say Kvothe was a good student at the university, came from a Ruh family, and was a moderately good lute player. While studying he didn't really rise to any prominence in any field, but what really stands out is his storytelling, his people are known for it. Maybe he uses this to his advantage, starts some rumours about himself, gains some notoriety, maybe the stories get out of hand, he's forced to leave university and retires to his inn under the guise of Kote... Then the world goes to shit, Kote sees this, and realises that the world needs a batman, but he's no Bruce Wayne.

He did learn about a little known magic where you can make things that you write down become true though. So when the chronicler appears he takes his chance and tells him this fantastic story about Kvothe, basically use his skill in storytelling to create this character that has the potential in him to stop the war, save the world, get the girl, all the things Kote just capable of. So maybe after the story, when he changes his name back to Kvothe, he also gains the talent and skill he's been able to associate with the name.

But...I am a little upset with this book. For all of its 1000 pages i feel like it touched on several different story lines without really completing any of them. And then it just ends. Nothing is really resolved other than Kvothe getting filthy rich. 

-I felt like the entire time reading it I was waiting for the main plot line to reveal itself. As i write this its occurring to me that i could possibly be reading this trilogy in the wrong perspective however. I finished these past two books with the sense that i was waiting for the Chandrian and Amyr to make a larger appearance then a few snippets of Kvothe seeing a chandrian as the bandit leader, learning a bit more about them from the tablet, and knowing that the Maer shares his desire and questions about the Amyr.

To me this seems like the plot that i was waiting to read about the entire time and yet it never surfaced. Perhaps though, as i said, im looking at it in the wrong perspective. 

Maybe this isnt about the Chandrian in singular plot course, but rather a history of Kvothe's rise to legend. His story of how he built his fame and gained his legacy. 

In this perspective i can see how it could end the way it did and have it be an accomplished work. But looking at it for the sole purpose of say vengeance for his family, i thought it was rather lacking and kind of frustrating. 

Your thoughts, fellow KKC fans? And dont get me wrong, i am a fan!

**TL/DR** What exactly is the *purpose* of the book? I feel like the main plot i was looking for, vengeance for Kvothe's family and the hunt for the chandrian, was rather lacking. Maybe thats what the 3rd book will be all about and this was merely a filler of heroic stories that embody Kvothe's legend-status...

Spoilers for both books.",8,2,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/KingkillerChronicle/comments/xoey6/a_jumble_of_theories_a_lot_have_been_discussed/,"One of my favorites is that Lorren is one of the Amyr. It makes sense that he would be placed in one of the largest stores of written word in the world, and explain why all the books re: the Amyr have been so thoroughly removed from there.

Further evidence of this is when he stopped Kvothe from learning about them in his first trip to the archives. Why would a Master go out of his way to help a lowly new E'lir to ""not embarrass himself?"" That's crap. Ulterior motives lay beneath his actions. Also the armed Caeldish dude who comes out of the meeting with Lorren. I think he's seeking books for Lorren like they say, but I think he is seeking Amyr books to destroy/hide them. He also takes special notice of Kvothe. I think he knows who he is because I think the Amyr have a special plan for Kvothe in the future, or are trying to at least steer him away from the influence of the Chandrian. *side theory: I think Puppet might be working with him as an Amyr himself or an aid of some kind. I think he might keep watch over the Archives, and that's why he's allowed to live there. Are the candles there for warning of the Chandrian? They turn blue, he calls for help? I think he may know the name of fire too, which is another reason Lorren trusts him.

Speaking of the Chandrian influencing Kvothe, I think Cinder is Master Ash and Bredon. It's pretty clear that he's Bredon. Kvothe describes his clothes as ""ash colored"" and his hair is ultra white, just like Cinders. Him playing tak (btw the only other person to ever play tak in the books was Felurian, interesting) with kvothe might be a way of getting to know how Kvothe operates and just learn about him in general.  He disappears at the same time as Denna while in Severen, Bredon and Ash both have canes... etc etc. The list goes on. Also, Ash is teaching Denna *the wrong song.* It seems to be clear that he is doing this on purpose to confuse people about their true motives and how they came to be, trying to hide their story, which is pretty much all they do, right? That's why they killed the troupe, and the Mauthen wedding. 

Speaking of their true story, I think I know why they are so dead set on having no one know it. I think knowing why someone does something and how they came to be the person that they are is part of knowing their true name. Before Kvothe sings (note it says ""sings"" in the books, not ""speaks"" or anything else, which leads me to believe Kvothe is or will be a ""singer"" (""who keeps you safe fron the Amyr, the **singers**, the Sithe"") and they have deep power over controlling names) Felurians name and completely traps her and has total power over her, it says how he thinks about how she craves attention, why she kills men, she doesn't intend to she just needs attention so badly that she won't let them leave and loves them so hard they die. RIGHT after that he sings her name. If Skarpi's story is to be believed then Kvothe already knows why Lanre wants the world dead (to stop people from feeling pain or sorrow) and how he came to this reasoning (the death of Lyra and changing his name to Haliax, or Alaxel I think is closer to his real name, since Shehyn got Cinder's real name right or one letter off (Ferule/Ferula) when she listed their names, Haliax is just his new calling name, and training under Iax in the Faen realm.)


One thing I am really confused about is the knowledge that Denna seeks. She turns down having MAER FUCKING ALVERON as a patron, to keep her patron, because ""there are things that only he can teach me."" And what does he teach her? The (albeit false) story of Lanre and Lyra and Selitos and the beginning of the Amyr. Why does she want this information so badly? Did something happen to her family, like Kvothe's? Does she think the Amyr killed them and is seeking revenge on them? I'd say the Chandrian but she was very disinterested in them when they were talking about them exploring the Mauthen farm.

Might not be an exact quote but definitely close enough. For those who don't recognize it, it's from Haliax when Kvothe sees the Chandrian after they kill his troupe. He is talking to the other Chandrian.

I have thought long and hard about this. ""singers"" is not capitalized as ""the Sithe"" and ""the Amyr"" are. They are specific groups of people. The ""singers"" don't appear to be. This leads me to believe a certain theory.

Kvothe not only has a clear knack for naming (practically named Cinder when guessing Master Ash's name before deciding to just call him Master Ash, I don't remember what he said but it was several names similar to ""Ferule/Ferula"") but has a knack for learning things quickly and music. Does music, particulary singing, have an affect on the Chandrian? Can someone sing names in some order or context that makes naming them more powerful/hazardous? 

Felurian speaks in rhymes. This could be considered singing. Are the Fae ""the singers""? Are they afraid of them as well as the Amyr? The Sithe have been represented in the Fae realm, so I assume they are Fae.

Now then. 

The whole ""Floating Leaf"" thing got me thinking about where his answers were coming from, and the answer seems to be the sleeping mind side of Kvothe, rather than his waking mind. This also seems to be in line with other things Kvothe does/threatens to do/scares people with --- Vashet is disturbed by his motivations for learning, and worries he might be a master liar to hide himself so well. I interpreted this as Kvothe's 'awake mind' morals are formed from his rough experiences as a child after the troop's destruction, while underneath his sleeping mind's morals seem to be much better. I don't mean that Kvothe is a bad person, he is obviously kind to Auri, his friends, etc, but it seems like he has some sort of deep 'inner goodness' that is what the Lethani is going after.

I think it's possible that Felurian and Cinder are related. Cinder's real name is Felura. Like Rothfuss / Kvothe says many times throughout the story, names are important. Felurian and Felura might be siblings. It could result in a sort of funny situation between Kvothe and Cinder.

""I effed your sister, bruh""

Update: There's a second part to this theory that I am less confident in, but I just want to get it out there in case it winds up being true. This could mean Denna is Felurian. I know that sounds ridiculous, but they both have that infectious quality and if we assume that Master Ash is indeed Cinder, then why not. Cinder could be trying to use his sister (or daughter?) to manipulate Kvothe. One of the theories you may have come across in Jo's reread is that what happens to Kvothe is not a coincidence at all (bump into Chandrian, Skarpi, etc), so what about Denna? Are their meetups all over the place pure coincidence? Or is she being used to manipulate Kvothe. Is that why she's being beaten by Master Ash? Because she's not doing a good job or not trying to?

[spoilers, I guess?]",4,0,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/KingkillerChronicle/comments/yrth9/sympathy_rules_and_exceptions_spoilers_i_guess/,"It's clear that Rothfuss has some pretty set rules regarding how sympathy (and the other forms of magic) works. I'm wondering if we can extract and codify them.

Rothfuss has said on several occasions that he'd like to develop a Kingkiller pen-and-paper rpg. Excellent: if he can codify the rules, then we can, too.

So, there are bound to be some base principles that should be pretty clear, and then some parameters that may require some effort to figure out.

[Here](http://kkc.wikia.com/wiki/Sympathy) is a nice summary on the magic system.

* The Doctrine of Corrrespondence: Similarity enhances sympathy

* The Principle of Consanguinity: A piece of a thing can represent the whole of a thing

* The Law of Conservation: Energy cannot be destroyed nor created

Right, and what does sympathy do, exactly? It relates objects in terms position, orientation, force, and heat. 

So, to dissipate the heat from a flame, you can bind something immersed in a tub of water to whatever's being heated, and the heat will flow as through conduction. However, you can also use sympathy to pump heat against the thermal gradient: for instance, you can use your body heat (37C) to light a cigarette (600C). It's unclear if sympathy can be used to transfer other types of energy directly. Perhaps the entire principle relies on energy transfer, and it just *looks like* two iron jots are locked in relative space.

In many places in the books, a character explicitly estimates the ""efficiency"" of the ""transfer"". Two identical iron jots that are nearby have a high efficiency, meaning the total energy required to lift both via sympathic link is only slightly higher than if they were lifted directly. Correspondence and consanguinity affect sympathy in a pretty straightforward fashion. Determining an equation for the exact efficiency may prove difficult.

Except, what happens to the energy ""lost"" in a sympathic link? I seem to recall one instance when somebody says that the energy difference ends up as waste heat in the sympathist. How does that work when it's the sympathist's body heat being used?

There are more question marks: you can create a binding without touching something, but it seems it helps to break your skin to make a binding with your blood, and yet you can light candles just by thought alone.

---

I've lent out my copies of the books, so I can't do primary research right now. I'm working on a puzzle platformer game that will eventually have a perfect rendition of sympathic magic. It'll also have a sandbox mode. I have this vision where I can bind the sun to Jupiter to light it up, but of course I'd instantly explode in something akin to a thermonuclear holocaust. No matter; I'd send the waste heat into the moon, giving it a nice red glow... assuming a realistic cosmology, of course.

In any case, it'll be interesting, however it turns out.

Seeing as how the Maer had just recently wed Meluan Lackless, and we know from Kvothe's discussions with the Maer's former arcanist (Caudicus?) that the lackless family is both 1) Incredibly old and 2) has a door with no lcck on their estate.

And since it has been pretty widely theorized/accepted that [Spoiler](/s ""Kvothes mom is Meluan Lackless's sister, who ran away with a Ruh troop"") Will that somehow be how Kvothe finds his answers?  By claiming kinship?

Thoughts?  Ideas?

""Seven things stand before 
the entrance to the lackless door

Therefore, I am sorry if this is duplication. I have scoured the interwebz looking to see if anyone has thought anything similar. But you never know.

Theory: I think that Auri is the moon, and Elodin is the boy that locked the moon away. I have read elsewhere that Auri is speculated to be the moon or essence of the moon, etc.--but I've never read that Elodin is suspected of being the boy in the story. I didn't give the theory of Auri as the moon much thought until I noticed the following.

On pg. 108 English edition, when Elodin walks upon Auri and Kvothe:

""They knew each other. Of course.""
""I expect Kvothe is a nicer person than I am."" 
""That goes without saying.""

She's still pissed, as I would be too.

On pg 109, Elodin says: 

""You've had better luck than I have . . . it's been years. This is the first time she's come within ten paces of me. We barely speak a dozen words on a good day."" 

If you've ever been in a divorce or royally pissed off a significant other, I needn't elaborate. However, I admit that what Elodin says above almost dismisses my theory. But. Let's keep reading. Kvothe get's Elodin to promise that he won't tell anyone and have her locked up in Haven:

""I swear on my mother's milk . . . I swear on my name and my power. I swear it by the ever-moving moon."" 

A coincidence that he would mention the moon? It seems that Auri is certainly mentally damaged, perhaps by a part of her name being kept in a box? 

Also, on pg 84, when Kvothe is trying to persuade Elodin to include him in his class, he says:

""Well thank God I'm the only one here that's ever made a bad decision in my life . . . I've heard stories about you too, you know. They say you toffed things up pretty well yourself back when you were a student here."" 

I had initially thought of the ""boy"" in the story as a child, yet Kvothe is often considered to be just a ""boy,"" and it is very unclear just how young Elodin truly is. He seems to know an awful lot about the university and it's origins, perhaps he is much older than he seems? There is also a very strong connection between Elodin and Taborlin the Great. I'm not sure how close of a connection, but certainly something nonetheless.

Moving on, it isn't until Elodin has heard Kvothe name Auri that he considers Kvothe to be acceptable as a student in his new class. While I cannot guess what Auri actually means, we know it doesn't mean ""sunlight,"" which is what Kvothe thought it meant in Siaru. One could speculate and deduct, given that it isn't ""sunlight,"" that it could be something along the lines of ""sliver of light"" or ""light of the moon"" or something similar--certainly something having to do with light, but not direct sunlight. This could suggest that Auri is simply a piece of the light or a piece of the light of the moon, suggesting that part of her is locked away.

Kvothe has a talent for naming, but he seems to only ever get a piece of the puzzle until he calls Felurian by her name in the Fae. For example, he names the horse in TNOTW very closely. Again, he mistakes the language and comes ironically close to the mark. This seems to be yet again the case in TWMF with Auri.

Ok. Enough of that. Thoughts?

As we all know Denna is kind of mysterious and personally I believe her to be directly involved with the Chandrian. I don't know how Kvothe ties in with her dealings with the Chandrian but I believe she likes Kvothe and has had some bad things happen to her and she accidentally becomes involved with the C shortly after meeting Kvothe. Additionally she could have been involved with them much earlier. 


One of the main reasons I believe this is the seven word sentences her and Kvothe tend to exchange with each other when they're together, much in the same way Kvothe starts to rhyme after he's spent time around Felurian. 

Now the following exchange struck me as having a double meaning coming from Denna's perspective. It's when they get to the farm outside of Trebon looking for Master Ash and Denna's things. 


Denna - ""I had some clothes and a lyre Master Ash bought for me.""

Kvothe - ""You play lyre? How many strings?""

Denna - ""Seven. I'm just learning. I was learning. I'm good enough for a country wedding and that's about it.""


Obviously the instrument with seven strings stands out as a connection along with the fact that Master Ash picked it out for her. Also lyre=liar as the double meaning in this exchange. This may be the first time she's directly lied to Kvothe as opposed to changing the subject or deflecting with her charm which Kvothe would be a fool for anyway. Along with that if she isn't practiced in lying then something simple would be the best for her to start with thus ""just good enough for a country wedding."" 


None of this is to say that this isn't just a harmless exchange between them but if she's directly involved with the Chandrian and this is the first time lying to Kvothe directly it almost feels as if she's trying to leave small clues for him in her words to try and get him to see what kind of trouble she's in. The romantic in me sees it that way but at the same time I feel like she will be the one to betray him before it's all said and done. Thanks for reading.

In the second book (? It's been so long since I've read the books...), he has Bast try and open it. I seem to remember that he was very excited to see if he could actually get it open. I think that meant more than just seeing Bast pass the test. What if Kvothe can't actually open it?

He can't do sympathy now. He tried with the elderberry(?) liquor to burn the soldiers that rob the store [](/s ""that Bast hired"") and he couldn't. Also, Kvothe looks surprised when it doesn't work. (I can't connect this to my theory, but it seems like it could be significant. I thought there was some significance but I can't remember now.)

And this is my theory: Kvothe stored his powers in the chest.

Basically that's it. I feel like there were little things that seemed to hint at this but it's been too long since I've read the books to remember now. (Re-read after finals, anyone?)

Okay, fan theory that I had hit me like a lightning bolt.  As soon as I came up with it I have done everything I could to disprove it but to no avail.  

Anyway, here goes.  

Taborlin the Great and Kvothe are the same person.  

We have already been led to believe that Kvothe is someone special.  Suppose, at some point in the future (either in the chronicles or the present timeline) he learns the name of Time?  Or through research into the Waystones, or the copper doors in the archives?  Anyway somehow Kvothe transports himself thousands of years into the past.  He becomes Taborlin the Great, simply through being himself and having his vast knowledge and skill set.  No one in the time before can cope with his talent!  

Realizing what has happened he tries to create a perfect society, all the while trying to return to his present time.  At no point does he realize he is Taborlin until it is too late.  By this point he has let magic into the world ""Opening Pandoras Box"" so to speak.  

He may have already traveled back in time, given his claim that ""All of this is my fault.""  

If we accept that he had already made one time jump, what if each disaster that has befallen the world are actually the results of successive jumps made by Kvothe.  He is trying to repair the irreparable damage done to the world and Time, but each repair attempt just damages it further and creates a new legend.  

His solution is to go as far forward into the future as he is able, and strip himself of his powers.  

The other piece of evidence on the side of Kvothe as a time traveler, is that I cannot recall at any point in the books hearing of Taborlin dying...or Illien for that matter.  Are these all jumps made by Kvothe?  

Now I realize this is mostly speculation, but the world in the present time (Innkeeper time) is very messed up.  Mystical creatures are rampant, almost as if the fae and human realms are merging.  

What other explanation could there be for some of these coincidences?

I think it's too much of a coincidence that the Taborlin the Great stories are so similar to Elodin's story himself. They are both locked in a room without any of their tools and get out by calling the name of the stone... Obviously they are also both Master Namers. 

We know for a fact that stories can be ""planted"" from rumors, just as Kvothe did for himself. And there's also the story Kvothe tells the townsfolk about Chronicler, where Old Cobb thinks he already knew it even though he didn't. So my theory is this: Elodin comes to the University and starts planting stories in peoples' minds about a namer called Taborlin the Great. Soon he starts having his own adventures and incorporates them into the Taborlin stories, like the story about the cell. It sounds just like a game that Elodin would just love to be playing...

Anyway, and another theory I've been having is why exactly he went crazy. My first thoughts were: what makes a Master Namer? Do they have to know a lot of names? Probably not, because then there would be quite a few Master Namers, not just one. We know for example that Fela managed to learn the name of stone relatively quickly, and we've heard from Elodin that once you've learned one name, the others come easier. So we can suspect that in the entire world there are at least a bunch of people who know at least a hand full of names. Then I thought that maybe the two events - Elodin becoming crazy and him becoming the Master Namer - were somehow connected. I came up with this: Elodin became Master Namer, because he learned his own name. We've heard in the book that to know the true name of something means to understand it completely to the core. Now think about it: if you understood 100% what kind of human you are, all the good and all the bad parts (that many refuse to see), wouldn't you go crazy too? 

That's just my two theories regarding Elodin, hope you enjoyed them! :D",,False,self,t5_2smxb,False,,,True,t3_1kc5oe,http://www.reddit.com/r/KingkillerChronicle/comments/1kc5oe/spoilers_wmf_elodin/,

What makes me wonder is that these are people that have been alive since The Creation War(or even before?) granted not in their current forms but that's beside the point. What makes me wonder about Kvothe's whole situation with pursuing the Chandrian is that they always kill anyone who even sings about their real names let alone someone who walks in on them post massacre. So with this in mind you'd think after they were forced to leave due to whatever force was coming upon them, they'd come afterwards to tidy up and take care of the boy. But instead of Kvothe being found by anyone he instead went into a kind of fugue and wandered the forest for some time, which would explain why they may have written him off as dead. What I want to know is that given that he's been pursuing them in some way or another, they would have taken notice by now, given the fact that they would have agents in places of power i.e the University. So either they're really inept at taking care of their interests or they are aware of Kvothe and are perhaps maneuvering him into taking certain actions so as to be a powerful tool in their hand. This I think, would explain why he would give away his real name, and instead take the name Distaster(Kote). The key event would have to be his interaction with the Cthaeh, a creature who can maximize the most pain and chaos via it's apparent omniscience in order to manipulate whomever it talks to into becoming what essentially seems to be their polar opposite, what with Lanre originally being a champion of the Creation wars turning into a creature that now stands against everything he once fought for. A fitting end in the Cthaeh's eyes. So now with that mind I turn my eye to Kvothe and see similar signs of someone who has turned against themself. And since the most ""soul-crushing"" the Cthaeh could do to Kvothe, ultimately, was to put him on a path where he would become a pawn of the Chandrian, or at least, act in the Chandrian's interests even unknowingly.

* *Kvothe* - ???: I don't know, I sincerely prefer someone who's not famous, much like Radcliffe before HP, or Maisie Williams before GoT. The protagonist should be about 13, red-haired, he should sing well...I think we'll heard of him, whoever he may be. ;D

* *Kote* - [Tom Hiddleston](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1089991/): this actor is already famous for his Loki in ""Thor"", so we know that he can play a wonderful conflicted character. With his hair dyed, there is simply no choice for this role. Also, the presence of two great actors for Kote and Chronicler would be a great introduction for the series, and since they appear only a few times, the budget should not be affected so heavily from this choices.

* *Chronicler* - [Paul Bettany](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0079273/): he played Chaucer in an old movie, and more 
recently he played a number of monk-like figures (Silas in ""The Da Vinci Code"", the protagonist in ""Priest""), so he has both the solemnity and the irony to play Chronicler. And he has the right age.

* *Bast* - [Jeremy Irvine](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3528539/): a young beatiful Fae prince? Jeremy Irvine could be great, I saw him on ""Great Expectations"", and he played Pip's role really well.

* *Simmon* - [Lucas Till](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1395771/): an actor who's working in more and more movies; has a clean face, perfect for the Aturian duke's son.

* *Wilem* - [Michael B. Jordan](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0430107/): experienced, yet relatively young actor, he'd be a 
good choice for Wilem 

* *Denna* - [Shailene Woodley](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0940362/): she has been nominated for Golden Globe, and I 
think that she could play a good Denna (the eyes have not precisely the right colour, but that can be fixed).

* *Fela* - [Oona Chaplin](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2772105/): she's a good actress, she's definitely sexy...I think she's the right person.

* *Mola* - [Mia Wasikowska](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1985859/): maybe she is too famous for a relatively small role, 
but she has the right age and the right expression to play the responsible doctor.

* *Devi* - [Molly C. Quinn](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0703939/): she plays Castle's daughter int he TV series ""Castle"", 
it'd great to see her playing an apparently tender but-not-so-good character.

* *Auri* - [Saoirse Ronan](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1519680/): I really like this actress, and I think she'd be 
perfect for this role.

* *Kilvin* - [Jeffery Wright](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0942482/): we need a black (possibly massive) guy with a beard 
and he's a not-so-famous but good actor!

* *Elxa Dal* - [David Tennant](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0855039/): already a geek legend for ""Doctor Who"", we know that has the taste for show necessary to play the master.

* *Elodin* - [Adrien Brody](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004778/): a great actor, he has both the harshness and the playful nature of the Master Namer.

* *Count Threpe* - [Woody Harrelson](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000437/): seriously, I'd laugh all the scene if he will really have the role. Have you seen him in ""Now you see me"" recently? He was 
very, very funny.

* *Ambrose Jakis* - [Harry Lloyd](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0516003/): the Beggar King Viserys Targaryen was a noble, 
spoiled, infuriating jackass...so Ambrose shouldn't be too difficult for him. 

* *Maer Alveron* - [Liam Neeson](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000553/): he can play a wise character (he was Qui-Gon-Jinn), and he's a good actor, so he can easily pass from a dying character to a great king. Do you believe he is 61 years old???

* *Meluan/Natalie Lackless* - [Cate Blanchett](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000949/): I think she can play both the free spirit, and the haughty princess. 

* *Felurian* - [Annet Mahendru](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3393732/): this choice is more or less random; I have seen this actress just one time...and this is not the kind of girl one can easily forget.

Bast is a prince...kingkiller? Interesting. There are different kings for different countries...as well as worlds?

1374651328.0,0,self.KingkillerChronicle,1ixzb1,I suspect deep sadness in the author...(spoilers),2,2,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/KingkillerChronicle/comments/1ixzb1/i_suspect_deep_sadness_in_the_authorspoilers/,"I've recently finished book 2 of the series and a pattern I acknowledged in the first book is playing to even bigger extremes in the second.  This is the author's first publications and one is always advised to write about which one knows.  Thus, the sadness I sense in the writing of Kvothe, I believe, reasonably be placed upon the author.

This is a little tricky to explain, so please bear with me.

I am an adult male who struggled to get into my first relationship until late in my 20's.  Watching all of my friends get in and out of relationships with relative ease, having flings or hook-ups, marriages, divorces, and children, all seemed like a foreign and fantastical thing to me.  I tried to assimilate into this world, but never had any success.  Despite being a social person who's good in groups, who doesn't have any physical abnormalities or personality disorders, I, for whatever reason, somehow never *learned* how humans navigate through the process of attraction.  When one complains about not getting laid for four weeks, or not having had a relationship in four months, you can imagine the loneliness and isolation that comes from being a virgin long into one's twenties.  Perhaps I'm the one bringing my own baggage to these novels, but I sense a kindred spirit in Rothfuss.

I consider Kvothe to be, not a facsimile of Rothfuss, but a fantasy of how he sees himself.  Yes, the character is wrapped in mysticism and a Dickensian upbringing that may play more to fiction that factual parallel.  But where the parallels I believe come to fruition are in the character's relationships with other women.

Consider Denna.  When first described by Kvothe, he is nearly speechless in describing her.  He talks of her like a schoolboy crush that never matured.  He describes her faultlessly beautiful.  However, is she keen on his advances?  No.  While complicated, Denna rejects Kvothe in a relationship sense because she is, in less kindlier words, a gold-digger; a prostitute.  Denna sees class and while she may think fondly of Kvothe, she would rather suffer the indignation, humiliation and abuse that comes with suitors, than debase herself with his lowly ranks.  I see this as a parallel of the young male in school who develops a crush on a prettier girl, who has more social standing.  They know each other, but she confides in him as a friend; discussing about how her boyfriends treat her poorly and so on.  A man feels tempted to argue that he wouldn't act in such a fiendish manner, but that's the same thing her lovers told her.  How does he advance?  Can he advance?  It is a version of a friend-zone relationship, through and through.

Now, while it's certainly okay to have the main character endure such a relationship, Rothfuss' way of ""fixing"" it for the protagonist is embarrassingly immature.  However, before going there, I want to address some of the other female characters.

Fela.  She's a beautiful student at the university.  Kvothe does not become friends with her because of normal social interactions.  Instead, he daringly (arguably anyway) rescues her from a burning building.  For his heroics, she is keen on liking him.  This is a typical fantasy for a child to have, to want to win a girl's heart and affection with heroics.  Wouldn't it be so easy if the girl you had a crush on could be won over without the knowledge of social interactions but instead, by simply having done something of a heroic quality.  Indeed, for those who lack that something it takes to interact affectionately and attractively, one often thinks about how one can get noticed in extreme ways.  Heroic deeds certainly fulfill this fantastical qualification.  Notice she isn't attracted to him because of the way he gently touches her arm, or his 44-inch chest or how he compliments the efforts she puts into dressing up.  The writer seems to not know how affections and attraction interact among the sexes.  Also, the writer is indulging in another fantasy with Fela; having a beautiful girl attracted to you while you are indifferent to her.  Not only is the relationship parallel a child's fantastical ideals of attraction, but it is a stroke of ego as well.

Look at Auri.  She's a damaged young girl, abused perhaps.  She lives seemingly alone beneath the university in a labyrinthine structure.  Kvothe tends to her wounds, socially speaking.  He's there to comfort and be protective of her.  The relationship, while it could be viewed more as a sibling-like relationship, I suspect something else at hand.  Kvothe's relationship with Auri mirrors the selflessness a man wants to convey to the world, without bragging about it.  Meaning, a man will often do *nice* things for a woman seemingly just to be nice.  However, when a man seeks a relationship, every nice deed, while personally satisfactory, comes with the silent, yet blunt suggestion of saying to women, ""Would you like to have sex?""  I am perhaps not parsing my words enough to avoid triggering one's sensitivities.  Yes, of course men do nice things for the sake of being nice.  But prolonged niceties for a woman speak to a different agenda.  Just understand that Kvothe is who he is, but Rothfuss, as an extension of Kvothe, seems to wanting to say how *nice* of a person *he* is.  To double-back on my thesis, I sense in Auri that, the author is making a juvenile plea on his own behalf, arguing that he is deserving of a relationship because of how he selflessly helps this wounded woman.  It is, as noted before, an immature and often ineffective way of attracting a mate.

What about Devi?  Devi is, perhaps, the only female character that doesn't fit will with my analysis.  Perhaps this is so because she bares the characteristics of a man; business-minded, a fierce negotiator and domineering.  The author can't help but have some ""chemistry"" between them, evidenced in barbed banter.  Why is it that every girl of beauty and bronze is attracted to Kvothe? (this is a rhetorical question)

I said I'd get back to Denna...

The relationship with Denna, relative to Kvothe, speaks of growth.  When the two first meet, he's a lowly passenger aboard a carriage to the university.  When they meet up again, she's discovers his impressive musical qualities in Imre, but she is already bouncing from one male patron to another who have far more class and standing that he has.  Kvothe is on a journey, asking himself, how can he win Denna's affection?  Rothfuss, through Kvothe, is asking if he could rewrite his life, how would he attract his Denna.  The solution for this seems to be rooted in the character of Felurian.

Felurian is a wildly fantastical character to whom Kvothe loses his virginity.  She is a mythically beautiful succubus, an eternal being of sex and passion.  Through this fantasy, Kvothe not only gets his cherry popped, but he does so by someone who teaches him the ins and outs of physical allure and affection.  She is the most perfect and idealized creature to do so.  After leaving Felurian, Kvothe is blessed with the one thing that he couldn't earn otherwise; confidence.

Confidence, when asked by women what they are attracted to most in a man, often finds itself at or near the top of such a list.  It is like a magical pill that changes the hidden behaviors of someone.  One cannot define what actions make one confident, only that they have the *feeling* that someone possesses it.  For a person who fails to have a relationship in their teens or twenties, confidence is an evasive trait.  It's one that endures an insufferable negative feedback loop, as the lack of confidence, mixed with poor results upon taking action, only leads to less confidence.  How different would things have been for me, and all of the other countless males who never broke through the understanding of seduction, if in our late teens the most beautiful creature imaginable exposed us to sex in the way Felurian did for Kvothe?  How easy would it be then, to possess the swagger and aura of confidence too often sought but so rarely defined?  I imagine Rothfuss wished it.  And I imagine he gave Felurian to Kvothe not only to satisfy an if-only for his life, but also because he didn't know how else others attained it.

To further prove his boost in sexual confidence indeed works, he flirts with and has sex with the next beauty he meets in the next town.  She even voices how ""different"" he looks, as if he left a boy and returned a man (speaking to that undefinable *something* that is confidence).  Indeed, a sex life is indicative of adulthood while the lack thereof is reserved for children.  I sense in Rothfuss that he knew of no better way, or perhaps even no other way, of maturing Kvothe.

In my estimation, Rothfuss himself mirrored a life not too unlike my own, living well into adulthood before either having a relationship of any merit or having sex at all.  I sense that Kvothe's relationships with women parallel a sort of re-imagining of his own life, a wishing for how things could have (should have?) been.  As such, I see these two novels thus far as a therapeutic outcry, for a grown man who has no other outlet from which to vent.  This is why I sense such a sadness...

Little did I know how cunningly I was being taught” NotW Ch. 8


Later when he first begins Sygaldry, the existing song he knows in ""Ten Tap Tim"" serves a second purpose.
When equipped with the proper knowledge (of runes) all of a sudden the song became a natural way for Kvothe (Or his sleeping Mind) to surface the name of the runes. It allowed him to shortcut the process of learning the runes.


Ule and doch are 

Both for binding 

Reh for seeking 

Kel for finding 

Gea key

It also gives practical knowledge on how to deal with the scrael:


Let me tell you what to do

Dig a pit that’s ten by two

Ash and elm and rowan too




“Yes indeed” the bundled man said dryly. “you’d be surprised at the sorts of things hidden away in children’s songs”


There are some weaker strands that could maybe work: the villagers of Trebon dealing with the draccus corpse. Felurian’s name being described as “the sudden song of her...[He] sang it out in four hard of song”  Also how he sets his adventure with her in song so it preserves the details as it is passed orally. 


I think that this will open up some possibilities in Doors of Stone. Either a connection to the Sleeping Mind, someone offered the Theory that when Kvothe was playing his lute in the woods that he was using a form of naming or an alternate form of magic like the Yllish knots. Arliden died because of the song he was putting together. I fully expect Kvothe to have his breakthrough using the music of the Edema Ruh somehow. Thoughts?

I had emailed Patrick Rothfuss, asking for permission, and leave to do it, along with the possibility for advertisement.. And just now, he replied, giving me leave, and said he'd spread the word, once we were up! My hopes raised, today, I want to begin work on this project, with fellow fans of his series. :). This will not be easy, and I've already posted on a few 'minecraft' forums, but this is simply to try to aid in brining awareness, and seeing if anyone was intrested in aiding me with this, if you are, I'd love to see you skype me*, and perhaps apply for a position in this, as this will be the first real 'RP' of the KKC series, that will be [hopefully] active. 

Thanks for reading, ;)

They go back and forth, and Penthe summarizes Kvothe's argument something like this: ""Sex makes babies, but not always.  Babies look like man-mothers, but not always.  There are plants that make it more likely, or less likely.  You must realize what you say is thin as a net.""  It's an argument of the scientific mind vs. the non-scientific mind.

That is not my [intent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorial_intent), but that doesn't mean it won't happen anyway. This post is meant to be a bit of fun about some enjoyable - to me - references in the first two parts of Kingkiller.

I'm not going to fully explain myself, if there's interest in this thread maybe I'll try to explain what I'm getting at later. Also, I haven't paid nearly as much attention to the books as many of you, so there's lots I have likely missed, misremembered, and mischaracterized.

I very much enjoyed the first two books and I like the close reading many of you are doing with the plot of Kingkiller, but I thought I'd throw you a couple things to contemplate.

First, you need JL Austin's, [""How to do things with words.""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Do_Things_With_Words#How_to_Do_Things_With_Words). You're all already Namers and you just didn't realize it yet. [Performativity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performative) and much of the basis for an analysis of text could be said to start here. Austin's theory points out how much one can do by speaking, the best kind of magic. 

Hopefully, this will lead you into [Saussurian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Course_in_General_Linguistics) syntagmatic and paradigmatic chains of meanings, the failure of words to signify the thing itself and whether the signifier actually controls the signified instead of the other way round.

Or, how something as simply as some [Posts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-structuralism) stuck in the ground will help Kvothe rain down utter destruction on all but the unnameable.

And then there's Lackless. The mother's family so utterly lacking in [Lack] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lack_%28manque%29) they've got a box full of not lack - the answer and fulfiller of all our desires. Or perhaps the key to finally having some important names to ascribe to his septenary opposition, conjuring them from who knows where, so Kvothe can finally get around to deconstructing them, as long as they're dumb enough to leave some more posts lying around.

This was mostly nonsense, but if you're interested, follow some of the links, maybe even go on and read some very weird books. There's lots more that I encountered while I read, but this is what I could recall. I haven't decided whether an attempt to parse all these references into a coherent message is worth it or not. Certainly, whether Patrick meant for it is irrelevant, 'cause if you hadn't heard the [Author](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_the_author) is most certainly dead.

Trapis relates:
""But the road is the same, isn't it? It still goes to the same place,"" some one asked.
""Yes.""
""Where does the road lead?""
""Death. All lives end in death, excepting one. Such is the way of things.""

Here's where I start to reach a bit, but bear with me.

There is a door called the ""Lackless Door"" There is the four plate ""VALARITAS"" door in the Archives. Some have suggested that this is the Lackless door, but I don't think so.

We also know there are four doors that minds can move through as they need to: Sleep, Forgetting, Madness and Death.

What if the four plate door and the Lackless door are analogous to two of the doors of the mind? ""Valaritas"" could translate into the name of one of the four. There would have to be two other doors we don't yet know about. If the door in Tinue is the door of ""Death"", given the number of students who go insane perhaps the door in the Archives is the door of ""Madness"", I would hazard a guess that the Lackless door is the door of ""Forgetting"" given that they can't remember what is in that damned box, but who's to say. The door of ""Sleep""... I couldn't say.

These would be important to Haliax I'm sure given that he doesn't have access to any of these options via the normal means. They are also doors ""for staying shut"" so I've been assuming that perhaps opening one of them is what brought on the current troubles with the Fey creatures running amok and all...

What I am currently trying to piece together is how the mechanics of it all works. If the four plate doors are the doors behind which the enemy was locked after the Creation War, opening them would allow them back into 4C, and maybe that is how they can get back without losing some of their power when they come like Felourian said.

If these were the doors to the Fey and they are also the doors of the mind, would that make the Fey the realm of the sleeping mind? Would Humans of much reasoning and little power in naming have had the part of their mind that knows of names shut away or ""put to sleep"" behind the stone doors, while the Fey have embraced the other half in a world consisting so entirely of things that go away if considered too strongly (Kvothe's inability to hold starlight if he thought about it, etc.) and lost their ability to reason in tandem with mortals losing their ability with naming, thus their reputation for not making the best decisions?

The connection seems strong. The imagery surrounding the killing of Haliax always includes the moon (""I could sooner throw a stone and strike down the moon""-Selitos) and there is a connection with the Moon and the Fey, so it stands that there is some connection with the moon that keeps drawing Haliax back to life which might be resolved as he said ""when the ailu fall nameless from the sky"" meaning he might need access to the Fey to destroy it or perhaps reunite it with the mortal realm and thus release himself from his curse.

It's just a *breeze* for him to summon some wind. He's tried to *pass* it on to me and my brothers, but we have yet to see if we can summon the wind with as much potency as he does. He has even told us tales of his time at University when his friends would ask him to lay waste to a particular room, making it uninhabitable for some time. He couldn't always produce the wind then, but he was still in his fledgling years. Ah, even now I can hear the sounds of the wind being called...

I think all fathers have this potential. Not all may find it, or publicly show their mastery. But I'm sure many of yours have this prowess, even if you haven't yet called it that.

But two things I have noticed that is bugging me, please tell me if I am wrong.

1. It seems literally every female character in the book is beautiful. Denna, Auri, Fela, Devi and Mola (who dissapeared after visiting Auri?) 
2. Every bad guy is completely evil. The Chandrian just fucking hate everyone, Ambrose is a snotty pos who everyone hates, all of Denna's suitors are snooty nobles, Hemm enjoys torturing students. It seems really black and white.

I think that a combination of a long wait between the novels and how incredible NoTW justifies some of the anti-climax of AWMF.
