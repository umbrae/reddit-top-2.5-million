**To enter:**

1. Upvote this post so more people can enter.

2. Post a comment with a list of the possible game(s) you would like to receive with a brief explanation of why you want the game(s). Also include a link to your Steam profile.

I'll then read through all of the comments and decide who will receive each game. As usual, preference will be given to users with an account that is at least 2 months old and has at least 300 karma. I might also take a look at your reddit and Steam history to help make my decisions. I'd also like to limit one game per person.

If I decide to give you a game, please add me on Steam so you can let me know your thoughts on the game after playing it: [http://steamcommunity.com/id/thefatalace](http://steamcommunity.com/id/thefatalace)

I'll start choosing winners when this post is 24 hours old. Have fun and happy gaming everyone!

Edit #1: Currently reading through and sorting comments, may take a couple days before I determine a winner for each game so thanks for being patient everyone.

Edit #2: In the middle of picking winners at this point, I'll try to announce all winners by tonight.

Edit #2.5: Very nearly done with picking winners, they'll be announced tonight for sure.

Edit #3: All winners are now listed! Thanks for all the nice entries and comments everyone, this has been pretty overwhelming. If you've been chosen, please accept my friend request so I can send you your new game.

Edit #4: Starting to send gifts now. If you're waiting for a gift, you don't have to be online to receive it. I'll be sending them out slowly so please be patient everyone! It will probably take another day before all gifts have been sent. Need to get some rest before I send anymore gifts, sorry to keep some of you in suspense for so long.

Edit #5: Most gifts have been sent out at this point. If I haven't sent you your gift yet and you've already responded to my friend request, feel free to send me a message on reddit or Steam.

Edit #6: Still waiting on a few more users to respond and claim their gift. I'm going to close this PiF at the end of the day on 7/31 as I will be moving out on 8/1 and I'm not sure when I'll regain internet access. Any gifts that remain unclaimed by that point will then be given away in another PiF on a later date. I'd hate to take away gifts from people that I've already chosen in this giveaway, so please try to claim your gift by then!

This time should give people plenty of notice and should be fair to people in most timezones.  If your points are MISSING, please PM me.  Otherwise, assume that your totals have been affected by the secret multiplier.

**PLEASE READ THE INFORMATION BELOW BEFORE SUBMITTING [THIS FORM](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dDUwNW1BS09NR1FXVEtjYUNUS21tcEE6MQ)**

Welcome, everybody, to our great Steam game giveaway!

We will be giving out many games in this upcoming contest / giveaway.  This might even be the biggest and most ambitious PIF ever, with over a hundred different games of all varieties.  We see random giveaways like this pop up on reddit from time to time, and through pure luck and/or timeliness, some people get lucky.  We decided to do something different; something that will give YOU, the participant, direct control of your likelihood to win one or more of our games.

------------------------------------------------------

**Here is how it works:**

Below, you will find a list of achievements and the points that they are worth.  You may complete as many or as few of the achievements in this list as you would like, up until the submission deadline of 11PM EST, January 5, 2012.  At  this time the form will be pulled from the web and we will go through all the entries to award points.

In the event of somebody really blowing us away with an attempt at an achievement, we will invite them to participate in a mini-game similar to ""Deal or No Deal,"" where they can win up to an additional 3000 points.  The timing of this event will be decided upon with those who are invited.

If the achievements are not your style, or you don't have the equipment to complete our achievements, you can opt to take part in the trivia challenge instead. In the trivia, invitation to participate in the mini-game will be given out based on good behavior, involvement, attitude, etc.  The trivia will take place on 8 PM EST, January 6, 2012.

Finally, any points you have earned will be multiplied by a super secret multiplier. And on 11PM EST, January 8, 2012, a list will be posted online containing the usernames and point totals of all the participants. 

------------------------------------------------------

**List of Achievements**

For all the achievements, your submission (image / video / audio / text) MUST contain the date of submission and your reddit username either spoken aloud or held up on a piece of paper.  You may mask your face if you choose.

* 100 - Upload a picture with a shoe on your head.


* 100 - Upload a picture of your best duck face, in a washroom, taken with a cellphone (if possible), with toilet/bathtub visible.


* 100 - Upload a picture with 5 food items in your mouth at the same time--all visible.


* 300 - Upload a picture of  your pet, prepped for combat with body armour and/or weaponry.


* 300 - Upload a full upper body picture of yourself, wearing 4 t-shirts backwards (not inside-out), clearly showing the layers at the neck or sleeves.


* 300 - Upload a picture of yourself wearing an eye patch and pipe.


* 500 - Video clip upload of entrant singing any song from [this list of 10](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0Bb3IG1Yv8), or playing one of these songs on an instrument. The username of the entrant must be spoken at the beginning of the clip.


* 500 - Upload a picture of your full body covered in tinfoil. (Only eyeholes, nose hole, and mouth hole.)


* 500 - Upload a picture of your hand immersed in toilet water.


* 0 - 1000 - Provide proof of something selfless you have done. (Points awarded at the discretion of judges) 

------------------------------------------------------

Round 1: 50 Questions
First correct answers to each question are worth 100 point.
5 Question point ceiling of 500

**Prize Distribution**

Also I ask if you ever do get bored of it (unlikely), give it to someone else.

Hello Redditors! 
Yes I am indeed giving away a Wii U System + the game!
WHY AM I THIS CRAZY!!?? 
Because people out there need help. I am thankful to have such wonderful family and friends. Its hard making a living every day for some.
I am just a college student
No Iam not in debt nor super rich. (just a community college with FAFSA spoiled I know...and no Iam not using the FAFSA money )
I saved up enough for this PiF. Don't fret...its free! Or choose to pay some of it. But its PiF! Everyone loves free right?


Edit: Video for further truth! :)
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cu7eKPQzfbQ&amp;feature=plcp

clarification 
my friend had the idea of the console giveaway back when I started an idea to give something truly big! She suggested video games since it has become a big increase over the years.
Its midnight and family is sleeping so thats why I am a bit quiet haha and sleepy. 


Edit 1: WOW comments keep coming! Today I will be spending time to read through them all appropriately. (Was skimming through some on my phone) 
anyways thank you guys for writing others deserve it! Means a lot to me and the future winner. As for the system its on a online kart right now and contacted customer support and they were happy to hold it till I pay it off. Doing some xmas shopping so I can't go crazy spending with my checks haha  

WINNER!

Then /u/hasnoclue beat me to it.   So I was going to offer up Tomb Raider! but then I saw he beat me to THAT too. 


SO NOW IT IS WAR. 


Sort of. 


You guys enter. Somebody wins. The winner gets to choose between Bioshock Infinite, Tomb Raider, or any other 50$ (or less? I guess if you want?) game on steam. 

ALSO

I **STILL** Have a THQ pack sitting in my goddamn inventory from Christmas. 

So that is up for grabs as well. 22 games! All of them really great! I don't care if you have a couple of them, you can still win it because it's just taking up room. 


**TO WIN** 

1) Don't be a dick!   
2) Upvote Me.   
3) Tell me why you like me better than Hasnoclue. (That'll be hard, he's a pretty cool dude.)   
4) Meet Karma Requirements.   
5) Link to your steam account.   
6) Make sure to tell me if you're interested in being given the THQ bundle. I don't care if you ask for a game AND the bundle.. but you will only win one.   
7) Tell me what Game you're actually going to be asking for. (that way it's not a surprise to everybody. some of us have weak hearts.) 

This is not an april fools joke. I will end this giveaway tomorrow night at around 5pm. 

**Edit** I'm waiting for Hasnoclue to select his winner since so many of you are overlapping. I've got reddit raffle all fired up for the big giveaway, and i've already chosen somebody for the THQ thing arbitrarily.   **IF** I don't select the winner tonight, it's not a scam.. i'm just really busy writing a paper on the history of education, and it's due tomorrow, so i'm trying really hard to get it done. **END EDIT**

**WINNERS EDIT**  Holy fuck guys i am tired. that paper just wrecked me. 

Anyways. you don't care about that. You care about who won! 

So, Reddit Raffle spewed out our Winner of any game under 50.00 dollars. 

The winner of that waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaas:**/u/edensb**!  Congratulations on your pre-order of Star Trek! This sucks for me because *I* want that. I almost rerolled, to be honest. **BUT FAIR IS FAIR**

As for the THQ bundle, I just arbitrarily chose a winner. Does that suck? Yeah, I guess so.. For Everybody but  **/u/reese_ridley!**

I've added you lucky motherfuckers to my steam friends list.  Thanks for all the entries guys, It feels really good to be PiFing again!

**EDIT EDIT** By the way, Baoum, the original dick, ended up NOT being a dick. But he was a great sport for letting Hasnoclue and me play off the apparent dickishness. Make sure to give him an upvote if you see him around, he's an OK kind of dude.**END EDIT EDIT**",Closed,False,,t5_2s4e5,1365021988.0,closed,summer12,True,t3_1bggxn,http://www.reddit.com/r/playitforward/comments/1bggxn/pif_the_hasnoclue_stole_my_goddamn_idea_pif/,

Standard PiF rules apply.

On top of standard PiF rules, You must do the following. 

1) Write me a story about the absolute hardest game (or moment of a game) that you have ever experienced. 

2) You must provide a LINK to your steam profile in your response

3) You must give this post Upboats. No karma, just attention. I want everybody to have a shot at this game, and I hate seeing 400 entries with three upboats. 

4) Tell me what your favourite song is (at the moment.) 

5) Guess a number between 67 and 896

I think that I am going to provide an example entry underneath this beacuse holy damn do I hate reminding people that they're missing stuff. 


This giveaway will run for 24 hours. Good luck!

**______________________________________________________________________**

It all started when I [made a comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/di095/to_support_indie_developers_and_because_im_a/c10cdzy) on our former moderator, HelloMcFly's post on r/gaming. We set up some rules together with the few members of the community we had back then and started what has turned into one of the most proud achievements of my life.  

I made a lot of good friends since the day this community was created, and had awesome time, night long discussions and game sessions with a lot of people. I gave people games in return of their love. I've seen the good in people, and got to know a lot with a huge heart. I always loved the generous spirit which is what makes reddit special for me, and this community definitely did not disappoint me in that regard.  

Within a couple of days, I will be stepping down as a moderator. With me being gone, there will be no one left from the original moderator team who've created and contributed to this subreddit. We've come a long way since day one. Looking at how much this community has grown shows me we've made a good job so far, and I trust we, as a community, will do much better in the future.  

The first game I'm giving away is special, because it is the first game that has ever been PiF'd    


**[Amnesia: The Dark Descent](http://store.steampowered.com/app/57300/)**  

The rest of the games are;

It seems some users who have recieved multiple games but have PiFed none, have been suddenly PiFing games.

Great right, that what this system is supposed to do! Well it seems some of these users hate the new system. They are now making fake PiF's, registering new accounts and then having those accounts win the game.

I'm not going to name the people involved, but I'm am letting everyone know, this will not be tolerated. So because of these bad apples, now verification **may** be required to receive the points. **Remember, Pifers need to message the mods once they complete the PiF, with a link to the thread and usernames of winners.**

If you have less than 3 PiF's or any accounts involved are less than 5 months old, then verification most likely will be needed. Verification proof may be a screenshot of steam showing the game and the username who received it. It's best to screenshot the email that says a game was redeemed for those non steam games. A screenshot of the confirmation window a game was gifted will also work, but it needs to show the game, your account and the recipient account. **Screenshots should be in PNG to avoid mistaking compression artifacts as photoshoping**

**If you PiF to an account less than 1 month old, it will not count as a PiF point. We reserve the right to request verification for any PiF if we think it's necessary.**

Here we are trying to improve this community and these users are trying to exploit it again.

I have zero tolerance for this crap.

And as you can imagine, there's a lot going on behind the scenes that we don't even know about until it appears, like the ratio numbers, the new complete-a-pif-form and whatnot.

It is due to the mods that this happens. So, thanks guys, for all you do.

Please don't request a game unless you're actually going to play it. Nothing is more upsetting then giving away a game only to see the person redeem it and then not play it for weeks, if ever.

Also please don't downvote other users posts, when I randomly pick the users I load all the posts in the thread (reddit gold makes this easy). Then I use a random number generator to select the winning post; downvoting other people's posts do you no good and simply waste your own time.


.


**-&gt; Instructions &lt;-**

First of all if you feel like leaving a message or thank you note for our donors when you're done then you can do so using [this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dDBRTk9DM1NQOG84MDBHYjF2SEtSM2c6MQ#gid=0).

Go to the game list located [here (CLICK ME)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ammwcg89dPycdHJGemdROWRBNE5sNFM5Mmt5aGVLbmc#gid=5), scroll through the donor list (just do it) and pick up to three games, then post the title(s) here - that's it you're done. I'll randomly select some winners (probably 3 to 7) in a day or two and give out the games.

When you list your three games make sure you list the ones you want the most first because you only get one game if you win and we go from the top of your list to the bottom (you list 3 in case we don't have your first choice).

Make sure you list your Steam profile URL, you can't win without it! (well you can, but it takes longer to get your game).

**Group 1:**

FinderOfNemo - Half-Life Complete 

twell99 - Left 4 Dead 2

Deutschbury - Orange Box

**Group 2:** 

MissMelons - CIV IV

**Group 4:**

-----------------------------------------------------

You might notice that not everything was given away. That's because I'm not going to give games to submissions that just don't meet my standards. And those standards aren't high, just look at my exes. *ba dum tsh* But seriously, I gave out what I thought was deserving, but I'll be keeping what wasn't given away for another give away to go up tonight or tomorrow. Or, maybe I thought your stuff was good enough to win, but you didn't meet the requirements. That could mean bad ratio, not enough karma, not enough time, etc. 

-----------------------------------------------------------


**And we're closed folks. Thanks for playing, I'll get back here with the winners ASAP.**

----------------------------------------------------------

~~**DON'T FORGET TO UPVOTE FOR VISIBILTY**~~

--------------------------------------------------------

**NOTE FOR WHEN YOU ENTER**: Please include your top 3 choices for games out of the category, along with your steam account link. This will speed up the contacting and choosing of games for the winners.

----------------------------------------------------------

Hey /r/playitforward, do you know what time it is? 

You don't? Well, you should.

Why? Because it's important, and awesome.

It's time for my game giveaway specatular! 

See [these guys?](http://www.behealthybewellbeinspired.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/colorful_rainbow_party.jpg) That's how happy you're gonna be once you hear what's in here. 

You might be saying right now, ""But TG, I don't want free games!"" 

First I'd tell you to shut up, and then I'd tell you good, because you gotta earn them. 

How do you earn them? Quite simple really. 

---------------------------------------

**GROUP I, codenamed the ""Valve-Turner"":** 3 winners (I'll say what games are in group one in second)

To enter in Group I, you must take a picture of you with your favorite animal (doesn't have to be your pet). If you don't have a pet, put a shoe on your head, and take a picture of yourself then. Also, you may write me a set of 3 haikus. No particular subject, although sucking up is always allowed. 

--------------------------------------------

**GROUP II, codenamed the ""Collection Collection"":** 4 winners

To enter for group two's prizes, write me a story. But not just any story, I want the best story. The best story you have ever written. Length is up to you, just make it great. (longer length will generally be more impressive, although shitty writing will have the opposite effect) Also acceptable: draw me the apocalypse. Actually, could be painted, drawn, oil pasteled, charcoaled, or computer aided. 

------------------------------------------------

**GROUP III, codenamed the ""Gritty Games Galore""** 4 winners 

To enter here, plan the world's greatest assassination. Use of real locations is encouraged, although I hold no responsibility for you if you end up on the FBI watch list. Also, you can take a picture of yourself in your greatest assassin-y pose. 

------------------------------------------------

**GROUP IV, codenamed the ""Puzzling Puzzlers who Puzzle the Putz (And From Dust)""** 3 winners 

And finally, for this, tell me your worst joke. Take that as you will. A picture of your eye should also be included, because I said so. Alternate entry can be attained by making me some fantastic fan art of one of these games. 

------------------------------------------------

Now..... For the moment you've all been waiting for.....

**RULES: READ THESE OR DIE** 

Rule 1 will be enforced. End of Story. Multiple entries are allowed, but only one prize per person. Contest will run till 10 AM PST, Wednesday the 18th, at which point entries will no longer be counted after and judging will begin. *Entries without a mean name to call someone somewhere (aimed towards me) in them will not be counted.* Any attempt to bribe or goad to me fix the contest will be appreciated, but not accepted (Here's [what you should say if someone tries to get you to cheat](http://thecarecompany.biz/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/people_say_no1.jpg)).  Contest available only in countries with internet, and while supplies last. Entering for a friend is allowed, standard rules apply for that.

----------------------------------------------------

**SHAMELESS PLUG FOR MYSELF** 

Don't care if you read this part, but I just started /r/howdoiusethis and gained control of /r/aynrand. If interested, stop buy. I'd love you if you did. If you don't stop by, I don't love you and you are a cheating whore. Note: Going there will not improve chances of winning, it will only improve your looks. 

------------------------------------------

**IN CONCLUSION** 

You're all awesome, come on down and enter to win some of these games. If I receive too many entries for one category, then entry rules will change for it. This will NOT effect previous entries retroactively.

Rather than dish out the shittyness of all that on you fine ladies and gents of Reddit, I'm going to give back to the community that remained awesome and encouraging when I really needed it. I can only give one copy, sadly. I just got my paycheck, and while it's not much, it's more than usual. Enough that I can afford to buy one person Skyrim.
I'm going to say tell me your best experience on Reddit, and if you can, a link to the thread or post which was the source of that experience. I'll decide who gets the game by tomorrow at 7pm Atlantic time. Second place will get any steam game of their choice under $10 (or close to ten)
Keep on gaming.

EDIT: I'm going to do my best to respond to everyone on here, because you all rock so much. Also, I'm adding a third place prize. Same as second place prize. I would give you all prizes if I could. God knows I want to. I just can't, I'm sorry. I'm going to note names though, and if I ever have the money for it, I will gift them in the long term. I love you all.

EDIT2: alright, everyone. I'm going to have to draw the line. ENTRIES ARE CLOSED!!!! I'm narrowing down the potential winners now from who has submitted. Im sorry to all those I don't get to gift. My paycheck, which was supposed to be given to me today, was filed improperly at the bursars office and I wont get it for two weeks now so I'm now much more limited in what i can give. I would if i could, everyone, really, i love you all. 

EDIT 3: I know this is earlier than I said, but I've made my final decisions.

FIRST PLACE, SKYRIM ON STEAM GOES TO timeofyoursong. She provided links, and gave a great story about redditors helping her out when she needed it. Exactly as the challenge requested.

SECOND PLACE, $10 and under on steam, goes to splatch. Great drawing, I lol'd. Thanks for that :)

THIRD PLACE, $10 and under on steam, goes to Joss33 for the touching story. 

Thank you to everyone who posted. And honorable mentions:

Hey everyone! I'm blueshiftlabs, your friendly /r/SteamGameSwap moderator. Today's my cakeday - the one day of the year where it's acceptable _(and almost obligatory!)_ to karmawhore like there's no tomorrow. Seeing as how I don't know any celebrities, I can't use MS Paint worth a damn, and my cat wouldn't sit still long enough for me to glue a caption on him, I thought I might try something a little bit different.

My definition of _different:_ I'm giving away [my entire Steam inventory.](http://steamcommunity.com/id/blueshiftlabs/inventory/#753) The whole thing. 93 games in all, and one could be yours.

_Why,_ you might ask? Maybe it's that I love this community. Maybe I'm feeling exceptionally generous. Or maybe I've gone temporarily insane. (If it's option #3, you should totally take advantage of this before they show up with the straitjackets and the happy pills.)

No matter what the reason is, you - yes, you! - could be the proud owner of one of these fine examples of modern PC gaming:

***

[*] Anyone who enters for the Double Fine bundle will automatically be entered for Psychonauts. If you already have other games in the bundle, and just want Psychonauts, you can enter for it on its own.

[&amp;dagger;] There are 2 copies available - one Complete Edition and one base game. The first person to be drawn for Frozen Synapse will win the Complete Edition, and the second will win the base game.

***

### The Procedure:

Because managing a drawing over Reddit comments is a royal pain in the ass, I'm doing this over a Google Doc instead. **Don't enter in the comments!** _Yes, you! No clicky button!_

In order to enter, you should:

* Go [here.][form]
* Fill out your Reddit and Steam account info.
* Pick up to *10* games that you don't already own, in order of most preferred to least.
* Click the big ""submit"" button at the end.

***

### The Rules:

To make sure everyone gets a fair chance, I've set up a few rules:

You can qualify to win by **either** of these methods:

* **Method 1.** Gray flair or better on /r/SGS, **or**
* **Method 2.** A Reddit account that is at least **2 months old** _and_ has at least **300 combined karma**.
* **You don't need both!**

_Sorry, new-account people. I'm afraid you're out of luck on this one. Yes, I will clear the flair backlog before I do the drawing._

If you already own a game, or any game in a bundle, you're not eligible to win that game or bundle. There's 92 other things - I'm sure you can find something else that you'd enjoy.

Drawings will be done automatically, via a semi-magical Python script I've written for just this purpose. If you feel that you deserved to win, but didn't, go yell at the guy who created Python's random number generator.

The drawing script will draw a user's name. That user then wins whatever game they want the most that's still in stock. The game they won is taken from the stock, and it draws another user. Lather, rinse, and repeat until out of games or out of users.

The drawing will happen on **Monday, August 20, 9:00 PM EDT.**

***

### The Fine Print:

_Incomplete, typo'd, or otherwise FUBAR'd drawing entries may be interpreted in whatever way I find most entertaining. Double-check your username! Your Reddit and Steam account information will be checked, and you will be ineligible to win if you are listed on the Shared Ban List, are marked as a scammer by any trade site, or are trade-banned, VAC-banned, subreddit-banned, SteamRep-banned, or Rock Band. In the event of multiple entries for the same username, the most recent entry will be used. Games will only be given to the Steam account listed on the submission form. Games are for your personal use only, and are not to be sold or traded. Not responsible for issues with SGS flair applications - please read the FAQ first. Professional driver, closed course. Your mileage may vary. These claims have not been evaluated by the FDA, and these games are not intended to diagnose, treat, or cure any disease. All subjects intending to handle high-energy gamma leaking portal technology must be informed that they may be informed of applicable compliance issues. No further compliance information is required or will be provided, and you are an excellent test subject. No animals were harmed in the making of this post, except one who genuinely deserved it.

### The TL;DR: Click [here,][form] fill out form, ???, profit.

I've blasted WAY past my budget for this steam sale.  Originally I was going to PiF all of the Indie Bundles, But I'm afraid that I just can't make that happen. 


SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO, I am going to give Away Indie Bundles 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7! Right here. Right now! 


(IF you're wondering where 6 is... honestly, there was nothing even remotely interesting about that one in my eyes. so I didn't buy it. Neener Neener.) 


**THE NORMAL RULES.** 

All Standard PIF rules apply!

**THE EXTRA RULES** 
1) Positive and Even Ratios Only.

3) You must not have any of the games in the bundle you request.

4) You must provide me with a **LINK**  to your steam account.

8) You can enter for as many Bundles as you want, but you must make separate posts, And each post must have a different picture with a radish in it. You will only win once. 


I'll give this PiF a few days to simmer before Posting Winners. Friday evening or Saturday evening, most likely. 


**Clarification Edit** OH GOOD GOD, The store pages for the Indie Bundles seem to be gone. Harsh. Here are the games inside each and every last one of them.)

Holy god that took a long time. 



**Edit** Some of the numbers have been guessed, So I'm going to start sending out winners bundles. There will still be a couple left. If the numbers aren't guessed/Radishes aren't drawn by tomorrow night, I'll just choose winners based on Radishes. 


**The Closing Edit** All bundles have been given out. Not due to guessed numbers, because obviously that just couldn't happen, but more due to lack of other people to give these games too, based on the Rule of not owning a game in the bundle. 

I think next time, I'll think of something else to do. :/ someday i'll get the right mix of generosity and fun going on in these PiF's.

3) Link to your steam ID.

I am continuing my year of PIF with volume 5!  I am back from my long hiatus after writing multiple exams and getting through tax season at work and its time to get the giveaways started again!  I am planning to start hosting once the sales are over.

[THIS](http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198002004788/inventory) is what you can potentially win!

------------------

You will not be made aware of the queue in order to reduce the likelihood of collusion.

It has been over 6 months since I was last here and I am back one last time for an announcement / farewell and my last big PIF

----

First, a little back story for the people who do not remember me (and the people who may not know)

1. My story began back in September 2011 when I acquired 300 DX:HR steam keys that I [tried to trade](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap/comments/lh3xs/h_deus_ex_human_revolution_300_copies_steam_w_any/) over in gameswap.
2. Things went south really fast when [my plan backfired](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap/comments/ln84v/h_an_apology_w_your_forgiveness_understanding_and/).
3. Eventually after everything died down, I wanted to reciprocate for the kindness, support and assistance of the people who showed me that the goodness of people usually outweighs the few bad apples.  To that end I held [this event](http://www.reddit.com/r/playitforward/comments/o0jav/pif_possibly_the_biggest_steam_giveaway_contest/).
4. Over the next year, I held 20 or so different events in this subreddit. Relying on [trades](http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/comments/wpq1p/h_94_different_games_w_offers/) and capitalizing on [steam coupons](http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/comments/ole6h/1100_coupons_something_for_everyone_collecting/) for financing, and throwing in a few hundred bucks whenever the stock got too low.  Overall I estimate the group has given out 400-450 game thus far.  Just see my submitted threads to see all the different events our group has had just in PIF

------------


So why the goodbye?

The biggest problem I had in all of this was vetting everyone.  Who should get games, who should not.  Who is cheating the system?  Who is undeserving? Also, due to the size and complexity of some of these events and the planning involved, I found that following proper PIF procedure was getting to be too much of a chore.

Now, I feel that more than anything I am in this for the fun and therefore I think it would be fun to just give away things.  No strings (or at least fewer strings) attached all over reddit.  I realize that a lot has changed on this subreddit and things are easier than ever but honestly, I just want to be nice to people, even if they might turn out to be the bad apples mentioned earlier.  As I said, I believe that people are generally good.

------

First, I would like to let people know that this giveaway, and all my giveaways are not a one time only affair, I do these 'events' several times before moving on to my next idea.  Rest assured, unless you are living under a rock, you will NOT miss it! 

Here is what happens in this giveaway:

* Join my [steam group](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/redditgiveaway/)
* Enter chat room **whenever there is an announcement** that indicates the game is starting (This will happen many times over the course of a few months).  It will be at a random time to give everyone a chance at participating. (The announcement should pop up in your steam so you will not miss it if you are online and have joined the group)
* Once you are in group chat, you will be put in a queue or will be given instructions on how to enter a queue
* When it is your turn, you may pick a difficulty level (harder difficulty = better prizes) from which you will be randomly assigned a text adventure.  Make it to the end, and you win.
* Depending on your behavior, participation whilst waiting for your turn, demeanor, respect towards fellow players, and difficulty of the adventure chosen, you will get a list of games from which you may choose one.
* The longer this event goes on, the more likely it is that these adventures will get recycled.  You may see the same adventure more than once but be careful, there might have been minor changes!!

------------------

**Special Notes**

* Please read the steam group rules, over on the group page (mostly basic and expected stuff) and also the procedure for claiming prizes (also on the steam group)
* The prize list will constantly be modified as trades are made to increase the amount of games I have
* I have RL matters to attend to so the contest may abruptly end at any time.  Although I will try to keep it going for hour long increments.  Thanks for your understanding!
* Last and probably most important, it is **NOT** your right to participate in this giveaway.  Please do not have a sense of entitlement or complain and ruin it for others.  If you have legitimate concerns, please bring them up with me privately, and try to have **FUN**

As it is extremely time consuming for me to come up with these text adventures, I would appreciate any help that you guys might have to offer in coming up with ideas or helping me write some adventures.

So, I will issue a similar challenge for this game.  

As the Binding of Isaac is about a general sense of loneliness against the world, let me know your best forever alone story.  Not Friendzoned.  Not the usual story of Boy (or Girl) meets girl (or boy) where they're friends but s/he went off and found someone else and you never understand why they never go out with you.  No, that's the easy stuff.

Depress me.  Tell me how lonely it made you.  Make me cry.

But be sure to be funny.

I'll be deciding on a winner by Wednesday morning.  If there's a tie, I'll ask for a random number tie breaker.

Edit: Shit.  Now I'm depressed.

Edit2: [Perplexd pointed out this may be inappropriate](http://www.reddit.com/r/playitforward/comments/vw4p7/the_binding_of_isaac/c58c7wh).  I will stand by it and say that this was not meant to be as serious as some have taken it.  I've run this giveaway before, similarly, and won the game by providing a tongue-in-cheek ""forever alone"" picture.  I messaged the mods to get their opinion as well.  

That being said, I do appreciate that discussion can happen here, and I empathize with those that are giving serious answers to this.  I'd hate to trivialize what they've said here.

Edit 3:

Deep discussion time.

Games provide escape.  The escape is not without challenges or hardship - quite the contrary.  The main difference between games and real life is that a reward is known and predictable.  In real life, you could spend your entire life doing the right thing and never predict whether you'll be rewarded for it.  Sometimes real life contains its challenges, and rarely does one come out of it well.  Life is not predictable.  Life is hard.

Binding of Isaac is a really odd example.  It's about abuse, sadness, and loneliness.  The game is not predictable, and is not easy.  It can be rather difficult at times, but it makes the rewards all the more sweeter.  Like most Roguelike inspired games, the goal is to fail, as every failure is closer to a win.  

This PiF has been more rewarding in meeting others with similar issues to mine, as well as there very own challenges.  I find that lately I've been dealing with life by escaping into games and reddit.  It isn't healthy, but it's one of the methods I've been coping with my situation.  Part of the problem is admitting it, I suppose.  As a result, I've made more of an effort to get out into the new city I live in, today is no exception.

My advice on this forum is unsolicited, I know.  I came here with the goal for light hearted dark comedy for escape, but instead came away feeling that I'm not alone here.  There's value in that.

[pif0987throwaway](http://www.reddit.com/r/playitforward/comments/vw4p7/the_binding_of_isaac/c58ab11) is our winner.  It satisfies both being depressing as well as the tragic irony of his situation.  I hope the game finds him well.  I will be in contact with him offline to deal with all the points and anonymity and all that.  It was a run between him and MissMelons.

I am sorry if people found this PiF offensive.  As I said it wasn't meant to be cruel in any way.  It's a $5 game, after all.

I spoke with several of the entrants offline about where they are.  Reddit can be an amazing community sometimes.

Enjoy.

I would love to buy games for people who can't afford them, especially the homes with kids. I'm doing this so people can enjoy the steam summer sale as much as I am right now. Please leave your steam ID and a little story.

edit 1: Sorry! need to be more clear. Please tell me why you can't afford the games. I'm also trying to buy from the summer sale so I can spread the love to a lot of different people.

edit 2:A shout out for Caliwolv who is doing an wesome job policing this thread. I truly want to give some games away and it's great someone is checking up on people who are asking.

Edit 3: Well I gave away a total of 13 games tonight and everyone was really appreciative. The sale continues tomorrow and I apologize if I didnt get to you. I will try again in this post tomorrow. I would like to add that I am disheartened by the amount of people who tried to con me into giving them a game. I want to help people truly less fortunate then myself. So from now on these are the following rules.

* Not having a credit card to buy games is not a reason to ask.
* avoiding your countries messed up rating system is not a good reason. I'm sure you can find someone to pay to gift it to you. You are not poor.
* I am not going to gift you a game because you are saving money for your vacation. It is sad I even have to address this. Don't ask if all you are trying to do is save money.
* I want to respect your parents wishes, in that regard, I will not buy a game your parents won't allow you to play.
* Game must be on sale. I am looking to gift to as many people as possible. This means shopping from the sales. If you don't like this I am sure someone would greatly appreciate any game from the sale. Most of what I gifted I had the person choose.
* Please include your steam ID in your post.

Just use common sense. I know there are selfish people out there, but recognize that I am trying to do something to make people happy. So they can escape their problems for a few short hours. Please don't take that away from these people.

edit 4: Wow so many edits! I managed to give away a total of 14 games yesterday and want to give away a few more today. I'm here only for a few minutes and then I am on the road. Keep the comments coming and remember to tell me a little about you and your situation. I want to try to do this every day of the sale.

AS IT STANDS right now, steam has suspended my account for gifting numerous games to people. Today when I tried to purchase several copies of games for fellow redditors I could not. If someone has a line to steam to make my ticket faster that would be awesome. I also emails Gabe. I want to continue to do this so the people from today should shop for games for tomorrow. I will just double tomorrows winners. So instead of 5 people I will gift to 10.",,False,,t5_2s4e5,True,,,True,t3_ijvsa,http://www.reddit.com/r/playitforward/comments/ijvsa/i_have_given_away_8_games_tonight_to_fellow/,

They have no intention on playing it forward or being kind, but rather intend on just getting some free games.

I gave a copy of a game to one such character. I gave him the game maybe a month ago and he has played it for maybe 6 minutes (according to his steam profile). There are plenty of other people I could have given that game to who would have enjoyed it and also continued playing it forward. It just irritates me to see people take advantage of Play It Forward and the kindness of the donors. 

To avoid this, you should review their comment history and also check the [PIF Google Spreadsheet](https://spreadsheets0.google.com/ccc?key=tLK7EI_x-DOb9F8nM17eFmA&amp;authkey=CJag2s8E&amp;hl=en&amp;authkey=CJag2s8E#gid=0).

**EVERYTHING HAS BEEN GIVEN AWAY**

...

Here's me balancing my karma. I'm a Dota 2 trader, and I've been that since November. I've made a good profit and a bajillion games to myself and my friends by doing that all the while making a nice profit in actual cash on the side as well.

Well, I'm giving back now. I've traded a few Dota 2's to a beneficiary who gave me 30~ games for them that I now want to give away along with a Dota 2. To put them in a list, here are the games I'm giving away:

* ~~Dota 2~~
* ~~Trine~~
* ~~Plain Sight x **2**~~
* ~~Warhammer 40K Dawn of War 2 - Retribution~~
* ~~Metro 2033~~ ~~Bastion~~
* ~~Overlord~~
* ~~Killing Floor + Steampunk Character Pack 1 &amp; 2~~
* ~~Bioshock 2~~
* ~~Day of Defeat: Source~~
* ~~Magicka Collection (Sept 2011)~~
* ~~Super Meat Boy~~
* ~~Cthulhu Saves the World &amp; Breath of Death VII Double Pack~~
* ~~The Witcher: Enhanced Edition Director's Cut~~
* ~~GRID~~
* ~~Terraria~~
* ~~Dogfighter~~
* ~~The Orange Box~~
* ~~Serious Sam HD: Double Pack~~
* ~~Revenge of the Titans~~
* ~~Binding of Isaac~~
* ~~Frozen Synapse~~
* ~~Fallout: NV + Gun Runner's Arsenal + The Courier Stash DLCs~~
* ~~Nation Red~~
* ~~Just Cause 2~~
* ~~Mirror's Edge~~
* ~~Osmos~~
* ~~Droplitz~~
* ~~Tiny Bang Story~~
* ~~Serious Sam HD: Second Encounter~~
* ~~Atom Zombie Smasher~~
* ~~Greed Corp~~
* ~~Hoard~~
* ~~RUSH~~
* ~~Alien Breed: Impact~~
* ~~Dead Horde~~

Now, since there are so many of the games to give away I will largely just be giving them away but a few things to make this fun:

* ~~Whoever guesses one of my two favorite heroes in Dota first will get the Dota 2~~ **JethroTheRetroMetro** guessed this one: It is **Sand King** and **Earthshaker.**
* ~~Whoever guesses my favorite number first in **the first 2 hours of the thread** will have first pick off the list - any title except Dota 2. After that, it's random chance. It's between 1 and 100.~~ **No-one guessed this one right**. **It was number 9 all along!**
* ~~Whoever guesses which **two** are my most anticipated releases of 2012 has second pick. If no-one guesses both in the first 2 hours, whoever guesses one of them right first will have second pick.~~ **Releases in question are Diablo 3 and Shogun 2: Fall of the Samurai**. **No-one got it right, but ZeReaperofZeath was first to guess Diablo 3 so he has first pick** After that, I will use a rng, which is just me closing my eyes and scrolling up and down. It would really help if you had the game you're after specified in your post.

Other than that, fire away and tell me what you'd like to have in preferably more than one or two words. I will scroll up and down the thread and select 5 lucky people randomly at a time and move on to the next 5 after those people either respond or don't :)

Btw: Do DLC's count as PIFs or are the considered a part of the game? Not a big deal for me since I obviously want to give DLC's out with the games - just curious! What about the Orange Box? Or the Double Packs?

Also, am I supposed to post some sort of time to indicate when this PIF ends? That would be when everything is wanted by someone!

**PLEASE POST THE GAME YOU'D LIKE TO HAVE**

1307597348.0,62,self.playitforward,hva35,My Resignation from PlayItForward and the gifting community,69,7,71,http://www.reddit.com/r/playitforward/comments/hva35/my_resignation_from_playitforward_and_the_gifting/,"I have a bit of bad news.

As of the time of this posting, I am resigning as a moderator of /r/playitforward. I'm leaving the gifting community entirely, including the Reddit - Giveaway chat on steam (a fantastic group of people if you get the chance to stop in) as well as SteamGifts (nothing personal to the site's creator, who is an excellent person and developer).

No doubt you're wondering why I've decided to do this. I'm not going to go through the details here but I can give you the key points.

1. The community no longer needs me - In fact perhaps it never did. PiF rolls forward and there are a number of great mods who are sticking around and will continue to do the same amazing job they have been. I expect nothing whatsoever to change, until it's time to change for the better.

2. I don't have the time - I spend 2 - 3 hours every day moderating and working on PiF ideas. I don't have the time and my arthritis cursed wrists can't take the abuse anymore.

3. I've become disenfranchised with the community - This is the one I want to talk about more. However I think it would be lame to go out on a low note like that. Suffice to say there are a large number of people who have not one ounce of apprecation for the amazing things happening in /r/playitforward.

EDIT: Large number may be unfair. The vast majority of members here are incredible and I think the ability and willingness of the community to recognize and not reward scammers is impressive. Any number is more than I'd like to see though and the principal issue is that I can no longer handle being outraged while people attempt to scam some of the kindest and most generous people I've ever met. It literally makes me sick to my stomach and 1 is a larger number than I'd like to see. I'm not talking about those who haven't gifted yet, but those who never plan to. Those who in fact have never even read the sidebar and just comment on PiF's that ask for something specific. Those who would seek to grab everything they can before destroying the community here. You can't let that happen, and I can't be the one to see it first anymore.

I think it's probably best to be short and sweet. In closing, I just want to say thank you for everything that each and every one of you has done for the community. I love you all and I hope happiness and laughter find you wherever you are.

Hey :-)

Thanks to a great suggestion from user pdinc, we've started the process of adding badges to users who have a verified PiF history (have given at least one game (not trial, free or HIB in most cases). The icon is the little dude from Fallout 3 giving the thumbs up.

To get your decal faster, please include a link to one of your PiF threads that fits the criteria above in the comments. We'll be researching and adding badges as fast as we can.

We believe this will encourage participation in the community and make it easier for gifters to make a decision about who to award to. Of course gifting to the same people would become circular eventually and we encourage you to pay it ""forward"" so don't feel pressured to give the game to somebody with a badge.

The badge will show up on the front page of /r/playitforward as well as in the comments. If there are any questions or complaints, you know where they go :-)

The rules are simple:
I have picked a number between 1 and 1000. 
The three people with the closest number wins. 

Also, (just in case there is a tie) please post your favorite youtube channel. Keep in mind I like people like CinemaSins, and YourMovieSucks, as well as RoosterTeeth and what not. 
This is ONLY if there is a tie. 

Whoever the three closest people are will be able to get ANY game of their choice.
It must be a single game though. DLCs that are sold separately will not be included. 


If you have any questions at all, please message me.

These changes will affect all PiFs not reported as complete at the time of this posting and all future PiFs.

**The changes are as follows:**

**PiF Point changes:**

Games that are sold on steam in a bundle (aka packs) **and not sold individually on steam** are now going to be worth just 1 point. 

Examples: Time Gentlemen, Please! &amp;amp; Ben There, Dan That! and Cthulhu Saves the World, Breath of Death VII, The Sega packs, etc.


This change will not affect most bundles like L4D Bundle or complete collections, those will still be awarded per 1 point per game. This compromise should satisfy both arguments.

DLC and such still don't count for points, everything else remains the same.

**The minimum requirements have also changed:**

PiFers must give to users older than 2 months with at least 300 karma to receive points.

So they have to be at least 2 months old AND have at least 300 karma.

The 1 month requirement is no longer working, we are seeing an increase of 4 month accounts with no activity for 3 months, then suddenly enters PiFs. These accounts also have low karma count (usually less than 50). So if you PiF to an account that is less than 2 months old and/or has less than a combined karma total of 300, the PiFer will not receive points for it.

This change will prevent serial requesters using alt accounts just to enter giveaways, which is against the rules. I personally don't consider someone a redditor if they just stick to the giveaway subreddits, like the serial beggars.

This is not meant to punish people, but these new rules will be a better measure against people who just make an account to get free stuff and make it significantly harder to use alt accounts to win games.

**This is not meant to punish good people**, so a mod can make an exception but please clear it with a mod before you decide. In some cases users less than 2 months old may be eligible, but again it's up to a mod.

Edit:
Few things to make more clear as it seems people have missed them: The PiFer won't get a point if the account does not meet the eligibility requirements, in all cases the receiver still gets points.

As I said this is not meant to punish the good people so in some cases exceptions can be made, but that is on a case-by-case basis and should not be inferred to happen all the time.

**Humble/Indie/Gala Bundles:**
No points are awarded for either side.

Please remember to check out the complete **[Rules &amp;amp; Guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/r/playitforward/comments/nsno1/pif_bad_rats/c3btesx)**, the sidebar lists the important stuff but not everything.

If you receive a game for a PiF, that game must be redeemed on your steam account. You are not allowed to turn around and try to PiF it to someone else. If you change your mind and do not want the game, give it back to the owner so that person can choose a new winner. If you want to enter a PiF and plan to give the game to a friend. It must be clearly stated when you make your entry.

---
**Other news and mentions:**

If you haven't done so, Install RES (Reddit Enhancement Suite), it has many great features. One feature is on mouse hover, shows the account age and karma in a neat little info box.

Also would like to point out the spreadsheet, seems a lot of users don't know it exists. The spreadsheet is in the sidebar, one of the big blue buttons. There are currently 4 tabs in the sheet. The last tab is called the watchlist. That is where we put reddit and steam accounts that are banned from the subreddit or ineligble to win a PiF. Everybody can see it and when we ban someone, we put the reason why.

Just today I caught someone who won 3 games in the past 2 weeks and is trying to trade them for other games on gameswap. So please research your users, use the report link to report suspicious accounts and you can message the mods or visit us in the Steam PiF chat and let us know whats going on. We want this community to be fair for everybody and prevent the bad apples from taking advantage of our good users.",,False,,t5_2s4e5,1337650017.0,,ocarina,True,t3_nt9jr,http://www.reddit.com/r/playitforward/comments/nt9jr/announcement_changes_to_pif_points_and_minimum/,

Hello Guys and Gals! TotallyGeeky here, and if that was a surprise, then you need to learn better. 

I'm gonna get right down to business. Each prize group will correlate to the numbers after the list of games to win. Follow the instructions and post your entry below. I'll be taking entries on here and on RAoG, so some will be awarded in here, and some will not. This will be open for about 2-3 days, I'll give you guys a 6 hour warning when I feel like it. Hooray for specifics!

*FOR EVERY ENTRY, I REQUIRE THE FOLLOWING (AND THE SPECIFICS FOR EACH ENTRY):*

* 300 Combined Karma 

* 3 Month Old Account 

* A link to your steam profile (which must be at least 3 months old, and have at least 3 non F2P games) 

I'll add other rules at my discretion, but I think that covers most of it. 

Here's the specific entry conditions for each group. 

***DON'T FORGET, THESE WINNERS WILL BE PICKED AT MY DISCRETION***

-----------------------------------------

***GROUP 1***

You must write a story me a story. But, I'm feeling like a bit of self promotion (Kinda), so you must write the story about one of Noah Bradley's art pieces, seen [here](http://imgur.com/a/5v2q7#0), see  /r/noahbradley for more. Write a background about the scene, write a biography for a character, write a narrative about any of it, just give me something and link the image you worked with. Minimum length of the story is enough to give the picture a background, a narrative would be nice. 

-------------------------------------------------

***GROUP 2***

I'd like to treat my girlfriend to some cute pictures, so I need the cutest things around. Cats are king in this competition, but good variety is encouraged. The more the merrier for this competition, more will always help. 

--------------------------------------------------

***GROUP 3***

You will write me a poem, confessing your love for me. I make you do this because I love these games in the section an extra large amount. Actual poetry will do a lot better than pseudo-prose. Working in my interests will make your poem even better. Minimum of 12 lines, Although a general rule will be the longer the better. Unless it's shitty. Then I'll be disappointed that you wasted that much time on it. 

---------------------------------------------

***GROUP 4***

It's the Valve games, so in honor you need to trade me an unusual. Just kidding, I just want you to either make me a pretty little picture of a new TF2 unusual effect (must be made by you), or..... Actually, that's it. I just want a picture of your idea for a new effect. The better it is, the better your chances. Also, optional is to design a new hat too.

------------------------------------------

***GROUP 5***

DOTA 2, brah. Just comment saying you want it, and link me an amazing song. Bonus points if you involve my favorite genres (dubstep, jazz, trap, or electroswing).

1325808787.0,49,self.playitforward,o4og0,[PiF] The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim,59,10,90,http://www.reddit.com/r/playitforward/comments/o4og0/pif_the_elder_scrolls_v_skyrim/,"**Thanks everyone for your continuous generosity and support for this subreddit.**

I would also like to thank everyone who entered. I really appreciate all of you who spent a considerable amount of time and effort on your stories. Before I announce the winner, I feel I should explain how I had determined a winner.

1. I checked out your Reddit history, seeing where you usually post, making sure you just don't spam every PiF or game giveaway out there
2. I took note of your Reddit account age and combined karma (how that factored into my decision, I don't really know, I don't think it made a difference really)
3. I checked to see if you had ever given out any games or if you had already won games from other PiFs as well as checking what those games were (made a significant impact on my choice)
4. I read your story and noted how much time I felt you probably spent on it and if I actually liked the story (played a smaller role in my decision, but still mattered)
5. I checked out your Steam account to see which games you already own as well as how many games you actually have on your account (slight impact on choice) 
6. I checked to see if you actually played the games you won from other PiFs (if applicable, noticeable impact on choice)

I compiled all of these factors onto a spreadsheet where I could better compare each entrant side by side. By far, this was the most difficult PiF I have done in terms of determining a winner, if I had $1700 to spare, I would get you all Skyrim, but sadly I do not.

Now then, to the moment you have all been anxiously been waiting for. The winner of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is...

**TheLorax86!** Congratulations on winning! While it is easy to simply say that he won because of his ratio (and shiny candy cane flair), it was more than just that. Initially, I wanted to make sure that my decision wouldn't purely be based on the number of PiFs a person has done. I wanted to pick someone who had at least done a PiF in the past, but I also wanted to give those who hadn't done one yet to still have a chance. I apologize if you feel that he won based on his ratio, but believe me when I say that I spent hours over these past few days trying to figure out who would win. In fact, I couldn't help but debate who would win as I was typing out this message!

I would also like to apologize to all those who entered, but did not win. I regret that I only have one copy to give out. Though, if I am able to pick up another copy for a reasonable price, I will come back to this thread and choose someone else to give the game out to. If you feel disappointed, please blame the microscopic dragons. I did not see that coming, no one ever does...

Thanks everyone and I wish you luck in your future PiFs!

~~Hey, remember way back when I did that other PiF I said you would want to get your ratio as good as possible for my next PiF? **This** was the PiF I was talking about.~~

~~So, I mentioned it a while back in chat, but I got some pretty awesome deals on games during this past Steam Winter Sale. I even wrote about it [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/nxdfr/a_steam_trading_story/) using an alternate account. Rather keep the spoils to myself, the generosity of NotADoctor, gmduncanidaho, sevenalive, and as well as all of you that did PiFs over the holidays inspired me to play forward this awesome game (I traded Saints Row: The Third and other stuff for it).~~

~~Anyway, without further ado, here are the rules:~~

~~1. You must own a Steam account.~~

~~2. You must legitimately own at least 3 games on Steam other than those from Indie Bundles.~~

~~3. You must not already own this game.~~

~~4. Leave a link to your Steam profile below.~~

~~5. Your account must have at least 300 combined karma OR you must have done a PiF in the past.~~

~~6. Tell me ***why you want this game*** and **a story about ponies and dragons** (just because I don't want generic responses like *""Count me in!""*). Also, you can thank Miss Sunshine from the PlayItForward Steam chat for the story topic (if you were wondering how I ended up with ponies).~~

~~7. You must not enter just because you want to win a free game, but rather you should enter **with the intent to PlayItForward** to someone else in the future.~~

~~Meet all of the following criteria and maybe you will see your Reddit username announced as the winner here on **Sunday, January 8 at 11:00 PM PST***!~~

~~I will only take entries up until **10:00 PM PST on January 8***, at which point I will begin to determine a winner. The winner will be PM'd and I will send a friend request out on Steam.~~

~~If you end up enjoying the game, don't forget to PlayItFoward when you get a chance! Even if you don't enjoy it, try to PlayItForward with a game that you think others will enjoy. But again, since this is Skyrim, just try to PlayItForward with any game you have enjoyed.~~

~~Good luck to all who enter!~~

We aren't treating this any differently. So to remind anyone who may not know, keys from games featured in the PWYW Indie Bundles, like this one, are ineligible for points. Only steam gifts of the titles are eligible.

I also want to remind users to have there steam games library visible.
We need this page to be visible: http://steamcommunity.com/id/sevenalive/games?tab=all

The mods use it to make sure games are redeemed on the account. The givers use it to make sure you don't already own the game.

If your profile is set to private,your best setting is friends of friends. If we need to see your library and it's private, we may add you as a friend or pm you on reddit.

Edit: Some of you are asking why they don't count. I have addressed this in the [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/playitforward/FAQ).

Edit 2: A few other things.

PiFers have been submitting the form and typing in the game name instead of pasting the steam store link.

They are also pasting Steam ID's like this STEAM_0:0:35042979
Some have been pasting just the username.

Please post them in steamcommunity.com/profiles/12345678912345 format.
That allows us one click to the profile page, where other methods require us to input that info into steamidfinder.

I've been given a heap of games thanks to some very awesome PiFers but now it is my time to give back to the community.

So here I am giving away two fantastic bundles, [Indie Bundle XI](http://store.steampowered.com/sub/15390/?snr=1_4_4__sdd) and [The Double Fine Bundle](http://store.steampowered.com/sub/13701/?snr=1_4_4__sdd) which contain five and three awesome games, respectively. 

**Now here are the rules.** 

All standard rules apply, must have over 300 karma, 2 month old account, etc. 

1. Upvote this post, not for karma but visibility.
1. Don't have to have a positive ratio, just I'll like you more.
1. You can enter both if you wish but in separate posts.
1. Please state which bundle you want.
1. Followed by your Steam ID (preferably in link form).

&gt;Now, if you want to go for the Indie Bundle, I need you to draw a picture of a potato. But not just a potato but one interacting with or in a scenario relating to one of the games available in the bundle. Then a number between **1 and 500**.
&gt;
&gt;For the Double Fine Bundle you must write a small poem or haiku about one of the games available in *this* bundle with a number between **501 and 1000**.

To determine whether or not you have read the rules properly, you must call me a [Shakespeare-esque insult](http://www.pangloss.com/seidel/Shaker/). 

The give-away will be open for the next 24 hours and the winners will be chosen within 12 hours after that. So 8:30 AM GMT.

Good Luck, I wish to see some bitchin' [potatos](http://i.imgur.com/4XXGc.gif).

P.S. Only my second give-away so please recommend if I should change or improve anything.

So final check, format should go as such [BUNDLE] {Steam ID} [No.] (Poem or Drawing). Thank you.

Why is it that the flairs only represent the games sent out and the games received? No one actually checks the spreadsheet to see if games are actually being played forward, but wasn’t this the point of this subreddit? To receive a game and then PiF the same game back to the community when you had the chance? Even if you didn’t enjoy the game, you could at least PiF a game that you actually liked. If I could change things, this is what I would change…

**Be prepared, this is a long read.**

**I would make the flair ratio a different way:**

1.	Number of PiFs a person has started (or what I’d like to call “PiF Chains”)
2.	Number of games a person has received
3.	Number of games a person has played forward

*Wait, but isn’t the first and third category the same thing?* No, they aren’t. The first number is aimed at how many new PiF chains the user has started. For example, let’s say today I was to start a PiF of Dungeon Defenders. Did I receive Dungeon Defenders from someone else? No, so this would be a new PiF chain.

The second category is self explanatory; it’s the number of PiFs the person has won.

The third number is the number of games the person has continued a PiF chain for. If Person A were to give Person B a game like Cave Story+, if Person B were to one day do a PiF of Cave Story+, the PiF point would be added to the third category instead of the first. However, let’s say that Person B didn’t like Cave Story+ and instead wants to PiF a different game. Simple, in his PiF thread, he would just have to indicate that his PiF was inspired after he won Cave Story+ from Person A. The only catch would be that the game must be of the same category and Person B would have to have owned the game with at least some game time in it. Otherwise, it would count as a new PiF chain and the PiF point would be added in the first category.

*What would be the point of doing this?* I think this subreddit is broken in that the users only see the quantity of games sent out and received. I believe it would benefit if we were able to assess the quality of the PiFs as well.

Consider the following example, Person X has a ratio of [1–6–5] and Person Y has a ratio of [6–6–0] and both enter Person Z’s PiF. Who do you think would be a better candidate for Person Z to consider? Both users have received 6 games and have also given out 6 games. However, Person X has actually continued PiF chains rather than Person Y who appears to have just started random PiF chains. Person Z should be more inclined to pick Person X because his PiFs are of better quality.

Each user would have to link their Reddit account to their Steam account.

The subreddit is broken in that someone can make an alternative account and we would never know it. Last Saturday, I found out about a guy using two alternative accounts to enter PiFs in our subreddit. He had been doing this for quite some time and yet no one ever noticed. I probably would have never noticed had the two alternate accounts not had almost matching usernames.

It would be nice if we could somehow manage this by talking to the mods over at r/TF2Trade to see how they did their flairs. The Steam Community URL would be placed next to the ratio. We would also have a separate spreadsheet with every user on r/PlayItForward along with their SteamRep details.

*Why use SteamRep?* There are multiple URLs a person can use to get to a single Steam profile. SteamRep seems to be able to gather all the URLs. If a user were to try and make an alternative account, a simple CTRL+F for the steamID32 to see if it has already been used for another account.

**The subreddit would be invitation only.**

Don’t get me wrong, I want as many users on the subreddit as much as you do, but I would rather have people that contribute than people who leech. It would also help in making sure no alternative accounts are made just for the subreddit. Users would be able to request an invitation to the subreddit from the mods.

What about people making new Reddit accounts along with new Steam accounts? When requesting an invitation to join the subreddit, the person would have to include a link to their Steam Community page. If the mods see that the Steam account has relatively low value or is fairly new, the request to get in would be denied.

What constitutes as a low value Steam account? Any Steam accounts that only contain games from Indie Bundles would constitute as a low value Steam account. I think it would be fair that a requirement of at least 5 games outside of the Indie Bundles would be fair. It would be nice if there were a way to automate the process, but that seems very complicated and do not know anyone who could design such a program.

**Users would be warned earlier when they have negative ratios.**

Currently, the setup is that when someone has 5 more games received than given, we issue a warning to that person. I would change it to 4 games. Also, when issuing a warning, one PM should be sent to the person from the mods. The mods should also notify the other mods that a warning has been given out. One warning should suffice and unless the person violates the warning, no other action should be taken so there is no need to get other people to harass the guy to illustrate your point, one warning is enough. If the person continues to enter PiFs after the warning, that user will be banned. Users may appeal a ban, but only by doing a PiF of their own that directly continues a PiF chain. Proof will be needed and a mod may act as a middleman if need be.

*How would a mod act as a middleman?* If a person who was banned is serious about their appeal, they may buy the game that they intend to continue a PiF chain for on Steam as a tradable gift. That person would then trade the game to a mod to hold onto until after the PiF has concluded. The user would then message the mods telling them who the winner was and the mod would gift the game to that user accordingly.

*Why go through this middleman process?* I’m sure we all remember when people from 4chan decided to pay a visit to our subreddit and troll the community. This measure would help prevent that from happening. A screenshot of the gift in your inventory doesn’t mean you’re actually going to send it out when your PiF has concluded.

Back to the negative three game limit I discussed earlier, what about game packs that include more than three games? Let me get on to my next point.

**Individual games as well as game packs would count as one PiF point each.**

I am honestly so sick and tired of people playing forward game packs they got for cheap and getting multiple PiF points for them. For example, the Cthulhu Saves the World &amp; Breath of Death VII Double Pack counts for two PiF points. However, this pack was only priced at one dollar. How is playing this pack forward any better than playing forward an Indie Royale Bundle? At least the Indie Royale Bundle requires you to beat the minimum and starts out at $3.99. You say you do not want people manipulating ratios, but I think this is the cheapest way to manipulate your ratio. Also, game packs that are not always available would not be eligible to PiF. It would make it almost impossible for the receiver to continue the PiF chain for a pack that was only available for a limited amount of time. Sure, you could argue the person could PiF every single game individually, but the packs are so much cheaper.

Again, no one looks at the spreadsheet. All they see is that a person has a lot more games given than they have received. Let’s consider this example. Person A has decided to play forward Skyrim to the community. Shortly after, he wins the Cthulhu Saves the World &amp; Breath of Death VII Double Pack. Now his flair is at [1 – 2]. He enters another PiF for Borderlands GOTY, but is up against another person who decided to PiF a Cthulhu Saves the World &amp; Breath of Death VII Double Pack earlier. Let’s say that his competition has his flair at [2–2]. Who do you think the person hosting the PiF is going to choose if he had to choose between the two? Assuming the host had no prior knowledge to the first person’s PiF of Skyrim, he would probably most likely choose the guy with the [2–2] flair. Had the game pack been worth only one point, the guy who played forward Skyrim would stand a better chance at [1–1] against the guy who would now be [1–2].


**Humble Indie Bundles, Indie Royale Bundles, and Steam Keys would be disallowed.**

These bundles are “Pay-What-You-Want” for the most part (Indie Royale requires you to beat the minimum) and if you cannot even spare a dollar for a Humble Indie Bundle, you have no business in r/PlayItForward.

In regard to Steam keys, there is no way of really knowing the legitimacy of a Steam key and so it would be better to not take a risk in allowing those sort of PiFs.

*What about people who want to give those things away?* Let me get to my next point.

**Introduce a new subreddit for people who just want to give out games and keys for free.**

Pretty self-explanatory. Anything users wish to give away for the sake of giving to others should go into a completely different subreddit. I know there are people who give away their extra Steam/Desura keys from the Humble Bundles on r/PlayItForward, but I do not think the receivers should be penalized for receiving things that people wanted to give out for the sake of having the keys be used. Anyone who wishes to give out games and does not expect the winner to play the game forward should post there. I would recommend [r/RandomActsOfGaming](http://www.reddit.com/r/randomactsofgaming) for those types of giveaways.

**This concludes my rant.**

*What are your thoughts?*

If these changes could somehow be implemented, I would be more than happy to remain as a moderator and try and get this subreddit working like this somehow. If no one likes these changes I wish I could implement, then I think it would be best if I were to just step down.

**TL;DR:**

**This is what upsets me about the subreddit:**

* Alternate accounts are currently easy to create without getting caught
* The quality of the games being played forward are not that good due to people just wanting to get their ratios up
* Not many people are actually playing forward the games they actually win and instead go for cheaper options
* No way to track who actually plays forward the games they win
* Game packs counting as multiple points is currently a cheap way to manipulate your flair into having a positive ratio

**Here are some suggestions I had:**

* Invitation only subreddit; users request an invitation from the mods in order to get in
* Reddit account tied to Steam account and Steam account readily available in flair (like in r/TF2Trade)
* New ratio: [Number of PiF chains started – Number of PiFs won – Number of PiF chains continued]
* Game packs would only count as one PiF chain to stop a cheap way of gaining a positive ratio
* New subreddit for those giving out games for the sake of giving ([r/RandomActsOfGaming](http://www.reddit.com/r/randomactsofgaming))

**If the other mods do not like these ideas, I will step down as a mod.**

**THE NOT SO NORMAL STUFF**

I am a history major. If you want a shot at winning all of these stabbing games, you need to write me a Period specific paragraph that talks about something historical. 

You can write about the crusades, you can write about the renaissance, OR you can write about the American Revolution. You don't need to write about the Assassins or anything that happens in the Assassins Creed Games. 

I **WILL** make sure you're not just copy pasting from Wikipedia, cause that would be really shitty. I'm not allowed to do it on my Research Papers, You aren't allowed to do it to win some free games. 


Here is a link to the [Assassins Creed Franchise Pack](http://store.steampowered.com/sub/14728/) which counts for FOUR points. (AC, AC2, AC:B, and AC:R all count for points.) 

Because I'm all about fairness, This bundle is only open to Even and positive Ratio'd individuals. Yes, 0-0 is an even ratio. 0-1 is not. Your Paragraph will have to be REALLY great if you have a 0-0 ratio though. 

(And, just in case anybody asks, No, I won't be stealing your paragraph for homework... I'm in the middle of working on a research paper about how the Upper and Lower Canada Rebellions were integral to the timeline of Confederation... not even a fully armed silent assassin could make that exciting.) 

**This PiF will run for at least 48 hours.**

**EDIT** Hey guys, I'm going to extend this a bit longer. I'll try to close it up tonight, but no promises. 

**THE WINNING EDIT** Sorry it took me so long guys, I've been REALLY busy writing my own papers, so I didn't have time to jump in and check out any last minute entries that made it in. 

In the end though, for a few reasons, I've decided to award the Assassins Creed Complete Pack to _Madk!   Congratulations on talking about something that I had to write my LAST term paper on. The Jannisaries are actually a really fascinating point in history, as they were created to provide the Ottoman empire with the most loyal of loyal soldiers in the first point.

Of course it sucks, especially when you have a legitimate shot at winning such a great game, like Skyrim, but my hope is that this will make the community stronger, increase wariness of new redditors giving away 60 dollar+ games, and make you appreciate those who truly are putting in that much money to make the community great. I love this subreddit, and the feeling of giving away games has had a lasting affect on how I view generosity in day to day life. So thank you everybody, I am sorry that such sad people exist that tricking people out of happiness is fulfilling to them. Even though I cannot afford skyrim. I promise to make even more PiFs to show what this community is really about.

This giveaway counts as **five** points.

1: Must satisfy rule 1.

2: Any history of trading away won games revokes you from this giveaway.

3: Cannot own the game.

4: If you have a long history of begging (1+ month) in other sub-reddits and no other contributions with a 3- month reddit account, you are not allowed to enter the giveaway.

5: Orange and Red flairs are disqualified.

6: Upon winning, you must activate the game in your steam library within three days. Failure to do so will be reported to moderators.

7: Steam profiles cannot be hidden. Inventory must be shown. (to prevent gameswapping)

8: Steam account must have at least 1 paid game and be 2 months or older

Strict rules? Tough, I don't want people to exploit the kindness of people in PIF.

More giveaways, More happy people!  So you will see a lot of PiF's from me starting tonight, and ending Sunday Evening. 

(**POSSIBLY MONDAY MORNING** I mean, Let's be honest... Canada Day is a day to solemnly stare at a bottle of delicious Canadian Beer and say 'I'm gonna drink the hell out of you while being proud of my Canadianity!)

Now. I've been thinking. Every PiF thread I see has about a billion people just doing the bare minimum to get a free game. I don't dig that. I don't dig it at all. 

All of the games I will be PiFfing tonight are Great. some of them have been on sale lately, some of them haven't been. 

So here is the deal. 

In this Particular PiF, there are TWO games. 

Neither game is particularly new, One was very big budget, One was less so. I love both of them. Sorry, Kids. Neither is Skyrim. 

Please write, for me, A paragraph discussing how YOU feel about the State of Role Playing Games today. I don't care if you are happy about it, or sad about it. I want to know.  GRAMMAR MATTERS. (People who have english as a second language, don't worry, I'll take that into account.)

TWO people are going to win, based on how compelling their arguments are. 

Please make sure to include your Steam Profile in your answer. If you have one of these mystery games, or both of these mystery games I'll let you know, and Maybe we can work something else out. (but that's a big maybe. the dollars I have saved up for video games are dwindling, and soon I'll just be broke like the rest of you.) 


Hopefully this idea is sound and good, and I will Hopefully be giving out Two really great games in a couple of days! 

 
**Edit** You can enter all three of my PiF's, but you will only win one game. Just So's you Know's

**EDIT OF THE OH SHIT VARIETY!** I added a third game to this PiF. It's still secret. and it's still not skyrim.(Carry On)

**The This PiF Is Effectively Over, Edit!**  Alright guys, I know it's a bit early, but I'm gonna cap this one off now. 

Lcrbeattie, Xzhobo, and And_Why Have all been sent steam invites.  After perusing wish lists and games owned, I realized that I'd kinda have to choose who got what. So Once all three of them have accepted their games, I'll post what the games actually are! 


**THE REVEAL EDIT!!** 

Sorry guys, nobody was really showing much interest in this (at least i didn't think there was much interest.)  So I didn't think to update you with the giveaway games! 

here they are! 

And_Why won Dragon Age Origins: The Ultimate Pack - An RPG thta I believe to be nearly perfect in all ways. It has engaging Characters, a Great Story Line, and some of the better lore in recent memory (only beaten by games like the Witcher.) 

Xzhobo walked away with The Elder Scrolls 3 - Morrowind - A lot of people think this is the best game in the series, I disagree... but That's because I'm a little wishy washy when it comes to open world RPG games. I don't think thta Morrowind has aged anywhere near as well as some other RPGS.

Finally, Lcrbeattie won The Penny Arcade Double Pack (On the Rain Slick Precipice of Darkness 1 and 2) I played both of these games when they were first released on Xbox Live, and I loved them. They were a really great throw back to old turn based RPG's with just enough twists to be fun and fresh (Plus the story was pretty neat to boot!) 

So there you have it. 

What do you think, PiF... Should I do more Giveaways like this? or Just go back to the boring way?

LilOtter's Limericking of the Legend of Dragoon has actually made me want to give that game a try. I never played it when I was younger.

You, like us mods, have probably noticed that Steamgifts.com invites have dramatically increased in volume, which we think is just great. However, their volume is such that they are dominating the front page rather than actual game PIFs, which we don't think is so great. There has also been feedback indicating you agree with us.  
  
**So, consider this the official Steamgifts.com invitiation thread. Do you have invites for Steamgifts.com? Great - post them here! Once those invites are gone, please just delete your posts and that will be that. Alternatively, if you see people asking for them, just give them away directly.** Since these invites were never badge-eligible, we don't see this being an issue in the sub. Don't see any invites available? Perhaps there will be some in [this sub](http://www.reddit.com/r/Steamgiftsinvites/) that was just created specifically for them.  
  
This also means that all Steamgifts.com invite posts will now be deleted with the poster re-directed to this thread. A note will be placed in the sidebare as well. However, any PIF that has both a game and Steamgifts.com invites will not be removed. **This policy will begin being enforced in 24 hours from the time of this posting.** 
  
If this doesn't sound reasonable, please let us hear it. Thanks for being a great community!

Edit: ~~You can request invites here too, but please delete your post once you've received one.~~

Edit 2: **On second thought, only givers of invites should post, not requesters. The reason being I'd rather not have my inbox clogged with Steamgifts requests for the rest of my reddit life.

I have been highly disappointed in the lack of quality AAA titles in PlayItForward recently. It really seems like everyone wants to give away the cheap stuff in the hope of getting the good stuff later on. Change starts with us, right? Let's do this!

Edit: I may have chosen my words badly. I understand that games like HL2 and their kin are incredible values and AAA titles in their own right. Perhaps i was being too hasty in my judgement. I just want to get people some games they REALLY want before they're $10 dime-in-a-dozen specials. It's so sweet to get a game you can't afford!

To be eligible for this PiF, you must have an account that is 4 months old. You must have 300+ Karma. You must have a Steam account in good standing with games currently on it (even for the Battle.net stuff) which is at least 6 months old. You must not be on the banned list. You must have a positive ratio, unless you were gifted something horribly generous like a Valve complete pack and haven't had the chance to work back the credit. Neutral (0-0 not included) ratios are also fine. YOU MUST NOT OWN THE GAME I AM GIFTING YOU.

I reserve the right to change my mind on winners if I don't consider them fit for winning.

Lastly, the chances of you winning increase if I like your post. Be humble, be cool, be grateful. Tell me something about yourself.

There will be 5 separate winners.

If you post in the thread, you are automatically entered, so don't bother with that ""/not entering"" crap. :P (Unless of course you're not eligible.)

I will choose the winners in stages over the weekend. Sunday is the earliest it will be over, and Monday is the latest.

**Edit 7/21/2012 5:52PM Pacific Time:** Made edits to clarify. (Non 0-0) Neutral ratios are fine. People who post ""Starcraft 2 - (steam profile)"" etc are not going to win. Sorry.

**Edit 7/21/2012 6:06PM Pacific Time:** the_lief wins Skyrim. I've decided to upgrade it to The Bethesda Collection since it's only $10 more.

That seems more like a first come first serve deal than an equal opportunity. 

It may seem like I'm just whining to some of you (And I'm sure I'll hear it in the comments), but the rules and guidelines are there at the side for a reason. The 24 hour minimum is not the only one I've seen being broken recently either. Saw just a couple days ago people acknowledging and then ignoring the fact they don't meet the time/karma requirement, which to me is a sort of challenge you must overcome to get to be able to participate.

Remember, there's still about an hour left in the Steam sales so if you didn't win, you still have a short amount of time to pick these games up on the cheap. Thanks so much everyone for making this an awesome experience. Hope everyone has a great 2012!

**Original**: Hello everyone. I'm with Arcen Games, and we've been celebrating our involvement in Steam's Holiday Sale and Gift Pile Treasure Hunt by stopping by some notable gaming subreddits to run a few giveaways of our games. It's going on through Monday morning and we still have a few keys still to give out, so read on if you're interested in entering for a chance to win a copy of one of our titles.

What we're giving away, and where you can get it (on the cheap) if you don't win it:

**Steam Titles**

You can grab our deep space strategy title [AI War](http://store.steampowered.com/app/40400) and any/all of its DLC for 75% off through December 31st (even more savings if you go with the Alien Bundle which is everything together.) Not only that but it has a featured achievement Steam users can unlock to earn and win more stuff through the current [The Great Gift Pile treasure hunt event](http://store.steampowered.com/holidaysale) running in conjunction with the huge sale.

Our unique puzzler [Tidalis](http://store.steampowered.com/app/40420/) is 80% off on Steam as well. If you're into deep block-based puzzling (note: not match-3) for $2 instead of $10, make sure to take advantage of the hefty discount.


Additionally, our chums from Dejobaan Games gave us a handful of Steam keys to hand out for their title [Aaaaa! for the Awesome](http://store.steampowered.com/app/15560/)--on sale for 75% off during the promotion as well. So special thanks to those guys for adding to the pile!

All Steam sales end January 2, at around 10 AM Pacific time.

**Non-Steam Titles**

Our in-development sprawling 2D sidescroller [A Valley Without Wind](http://www.arcengames.com/w/index.php/avww-buy) is available for pre-order now through our site at 50% off the launch price (at the moment it's $10 as opposed to $20.)  You can also grab it on MacGamesStore, Impulse, and GamersGate. Currently in public beta the game is not yet available on Steam, but if/when it does arrive the licence key you'll receive will work to activate the game on Valve's client.


If you'd like to try any of these games you can find the AI War demo [here](http://www.arcengames.com/w/index.php/aiwar-downloads), Tidalis demo [here](http://www.arcengames.com/w/index.php/tidalis-downloads), and AVWW demo [here](http://www.arcengames.com/w/index.php/avww-downloads). The AI War and Tidalis demos are also available through Steam, though I believe that those are just the PC versions.

How you can participate in the giveaway:


Per request I'll be giving out the keys by asking in the comments for a number between such and such, so I can use a RNG to pick a winner. If the winning number has been selected by more than one person than I'll renumber those who picked right and roll again. If no one picked the number that comes up, I'll find the number closet to--and you can go over (not PiR rules.) The threads are open until I edit the original post saying differently. I'll close them sometime in the next day or so, figure out the winners, and deliver the licence keys to their inboxes.


We'll be adding extra keys to the drawing as we reach various milestones in upvotes, points, and participants to add some incentive for those participating to upvote and get everyone here involved. Basically, as this post accumulates more points and entries, I'll add in extra keys and draw additional winners for them accordingly.


If you do end up picking up [AI War](http://reddit.com/r/aiwar) or [A Valley Without Wind](http://reddit.com/r/avww) during the sale/giveaway, consider checking out their respective subreddits for regular updates and discussion.


Thanks everyone and best of luck. Happy new year as well!

Love,

[Arcen Games](http://twitter.com/arcengames)

**Edit**: An amendment to the rules above as wisely suggested by Reddit user cyantist. The reasoning is good enough for me:

*I want to encourage you to run the random number generator until you get a hit, rather than find the closest number submission. Shouldn't everyone get an equal chance? If 3 people choose 13, 14, 15 for a chance to win AI War, why then should 14 get a 1/81 chance of winning and 13 and 15 have more than that?*

*Why should people who post later get better chances? (Due to the fact that they can choose numbers relative to those who have already posted.)*",,False,,t5_2s4e5,True,,,True,t3_nyq28,http://www.reddit.com/r/playitforward/comments/nyq28/happy_new_year_rplayitforward_we_have_a_few/,

To enter: If you would like to enter to win a game, leave a comment with the possible game(s) that you would like to receive. In the comment, just let me know why you want the game(s) and include a link to your Steam profile. I'd like to limit one game per person so try to rank the possible game(s) in order of which you want most as well. I'll take a look at your reddit and Steam history to help me decide who will receive a game. As usual, your reddit account must be at least one month old to be considered to win.

If I decide to give you a game, please add me on Steam so you can let me know your thoughts on the game after playing it: [http://steamcommunity.com/id/thefatalace](http://steamcommunity.com/id/thefatalace)

If you win I'll ""forget"" to report the second game on the complete-a-pif form. Some people take great pride in their ratio, and I'm not here to cheaply chip into it. This is a thankyou, gosh darn it.

1357779159.0,41,self.playitforward,16a80s,[PSA] Points aren't working.,51,10,81,http://www.reddit.com/r/playitforward/comments/16a80s/psa_points_arent_working/,"The points have been around for over a year now. I'm not blind and I do read and hear the complaints that come along with it.

I created the system to solve the problems at the time. I would say for the most part it has been a success, but times and tactics have changed.

The whole reason this subreddit exists is for people to receive and play the game. Something that is lost on a lot of people. This subreddit has basically turned into steamgifts with a much better chance of winning.

Everything else aside, I think we can agree that we all want our winners to play the games we give them. I personally don't enter for games anymore for various reasons but back when I did, I only entered for stuff I was ready and willing to play the day I received it.

Those who enter to win games for which they want but can't play for months aren't getting much sympathy from me. I rather have the game go to someone who will play it now, not in 6 months or never. The problem is how to help determine those cases.

The other issue is people think they can buy Breath of Death VII and Cthulhu saves the World and get 2 points for $3. They aren't giving away that game because they like it, they give it way because it's a cheap means to an end for them. Then they ask why they only received 1 point for it.

There are so many PWYW bundles, every damn week new games get added to the ineligible keys list. Which sucks because Amazon tends to sell the same games and provide steam keys too.

The points have turned into a clusterfuck to put it bluntly. Before the points, there was a simple badge for people who given away a game, that was it. GoG has a Given and Received flair, they don't keep track of counts.

This is where you come in. The points are going to be going away, they just don't work anymore.

The problems that need solving:

* Hit and Run users. They get as many games as they can before deleting their account or just leaving the subreddit.

* The Traders: Those who want your game to use as currency to get another game.

* The people who buy the cheapest stuff they can to avoid the ratio limits.

* The people who never play the game.

* Those who don't give back.

* PWYW bundles. Count them or don't this is a problem either way.

--

So what's the solution? I want to know what you would do. You can forget all of the current rules, except that games given and received will still be tracked.

I previously thought of something similar to steamgifts. Instead games are given a point amount based on avg sale price, age. When you give games, you receive the value of those games in your bank. You spend your points when receiving a game. The only way to get these ""new points"" would be to give games. Then you only can receive up to the value you have given back.

Another idea was to limit the games received to 1. You receive 1 game or bundle, you cannot enter giveaways for another for a minimum of XX days. Then you would also need to give a game of equal value back before you could enter again. Hoping that people will play the games before entering for more.

--

Whatever the case, those with points will be converted to the new system, whatever that will be.

Edit: I should note going by steam's playtime and/or achievements aren't practical and easily faked.

Edit 2: A lot of people don't know about [this](http://imgur.com/a/tveVa#1), outdated screenshots but it should give you the idea.

Just reply with up to two of the games you want (but at most you'll receive one), and a link to your steam community page (even if the game is on desura or gog, just to make sure you aren't a scammer). Ideally it would look something like this:

Then another person used 2 accounts and a total of 3 steam accounts to enter in all the PiFs trying to  win games.

Even with the point system, please be vigilant and research your winners. Be wary of new steam accounts or accounts with very little activity. Luckily we were able to catch these guys, 1 of them only received 1 game because a PiFer failed to read the warnings and rules.

The rules and warnings are there for a reason, a very good reason. I am wondering if PlayItForward should be on an invite only basis. So existing users would need to vouch for other users to enter. Not something we want to do, but it has crossed my mind.

---
Also it's a good idea to look at the spreadsheet for your potential winners to see what games they received. There have been cases where a person won 2 copies of the same game. Yes receiving a game and then giving it to someone else (not in a PiF), selling, trading, or doing anything else like that is against the rules and a ban-able offense.

You also should not accept entries made by PM. People who PM instead of comment on a PiF usually have a bad reason to do so. You should avoid gifting via email, always get the steam profile. So you can research it and so that person can't turn around and sell or trade it.

Now for the 5th person, it's not a guess, it's a simple game of statistics, the largest gap is between 7 and 18, so this person would choose either 8, or 17 to have the best chance at winning, worse yet what if they had two reddit accounts and picked both?

Obviously when more people 'guess', it does come closer to random chance, but it's still not very fair, those who come later still have better odds.

OK, here's how it will work: no random picks - I will choose the winners based somewhat loosely on PIF ratio and reddit history. I realize that we all have to start somewhere, so I won't blackball anyone who is new to this subreddit. That being said, if someone like NotADoctor or GlaPos (along with several other generous individuals) puts their name in the hat, I will give them strong preference. Also, it would be greatly appreciated if Steam profile links were included (assuming Bastion is your top choice). Please state which game(s) you are interested in, as this will help me in choosing who will provide these games with a good home where they will be given proper attention. ;)

Edit: Just selected the winners (10/10, 1400 CST). The hardest part about these things is choosing who to pick. I was torn between a few of you, so I apologize if you weren't picked. I'll try to do more PIF's as finances allow.

Actually, that's a lie. I did something mean to someone a little while ago and whilst it's resolved, I want to do something nice for someone random.

So, I've decided to buy someone a game, or games!

The winner will be allowed to have any number of games purchased for themselves totalling **£35 at the most**. Currency converters currently state that around $56, if you're not sure and want a comparison.

STEAM prices aren't quite done with a currency converter though, so please check http://www.steamprices.com/uk which will allow you to browse appropriate prices. I'm afraid my card will deny a purchase through steam using VPN to purchase in USD (I tested it.), so I cannot do this. Apologies.

The rule to enter and win this is quite simply:

**I want to know why gaming is important to you** 

The reason I judge ""best"" by my own standards will be picked as a winner at 23:59 BST(GMT+1) tomorrow (13/05/12). I will probably reject a very poorly written one.

If BST confuses you, http://wwp.britishsummertime.co.uk/ I hope that helps.

Oh, as far as I'm concerned - *you do not have to let me know what game you want here*. I don't want your choice of game swaying my decision.

**EDIT** With 24 hours to go before I have to make my decision, I made one reply to someone on here. But I felt that was a little unfair, so I felt I had to reply to everyone else who had written anything. No-one left out. Sorry if anyone's was missed out somehow, I didn't mean to. I'm feeling a little terrible about asking this question right now though, because I feel like I'm judging some people's lives. I just want everyone to know that I'm not judging your reason, I'm looking for the person who I think is most honest about themselves.

Please note that my reply doesn't mean to have any affect on who I will choose.

**EDIT 2** after a massive amount of deliberation, I've picked EDCO as the winner this time.

I hate having to choose ANYONE with the amount of people who entered this. If I had the ability, I would have chosen everyone for the fair reason that you all have reasons good enough as far as I'm concerned.

Sadly, I have not won the lottery and cannot do this. Eventually I had to choose my three ""favourite"" and pick one at random, EDCO is my winner today.

PLEASE DO NOT PM me asking for the bundle, I will not respond (even though 4 people did last time, and I still bought them the bundle :( ). Leave a comment below, and if I pick you, I will let you know, asking for your email address so I can gift it to you.

EDIT(10:34pm GMT): So it is getting late, and I`m thinking about heading to bed soon. I will try and get a couple more bundles out tonight. I will buy more bundles all day tomorrow.

There seems to be A LOT of requests, if anyone wants to help buy bundles for people, just pick one of the many people that have posted a comment below. Apparently I could use some help.

EDIT(11:30am GMT): I'm up but busy, I will get more requests throughout the day.

With that in mind, I'm offering up [Dragon Age II](http://store.steampowered.com/app/47900/) via Steam gift. The first Dragon Age was (sadly) controversial for its inclusion of same-sex romantic opportunities, and a similar response to the second game prompted David Gaider, Bioware employee and Dragon Age writer, to give [an eloquent defense](http://social.bioware.com/forum/1/topic/304/index/6661775&amp;lf=8) of the games' inclusiveness. I realize the intent of PiF is to give indie games more exposure, but I'm passionate enough about LGBT awareness to feel that this game and its developers are worth promoting.

Anyway, if you're interested in receiving the game, comment here with a link to a post/comment/discussion in your reddit history where you've demonstrated some sort of LGBT advocacy. I'll leave this open for a day or two and then pick a winner from the responses. I'm not going to require a PiF badge to win, but I do want to make sure that I'm giving this game as a thank you to someone who is either an outspoken member or a supportive ally of the queer community.

I am continuing my year of PIF with **Volume 7: Text Adventures** and 
[THIS](http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198002004788/inventory) is what you can potentially win!  I would like to also let people know that this PIF, and all my PIFs are not a one time only affair, I do these 'events' several times before moving on to my next idea.  Rest assured, unless you are living under a rock, you will NOT miss it! 

------------------

Here is what happens in this PIF:

* Join my [steam group](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/redditgiveaway/)
* Enter chat room **whenever there is an announcement** that indicates the game is starting.  It will be at a random time almost daily to give everyone a chance at participating. (The announcement should pop up in your steam so you will not miss it if you are online and have joined the group)
* Once you are in group chat, the order of play will be determined by the order of correct response to a question posted on steam group announcement.  This method seems to be the most fair.
* When it is your turn, you will be given the titles of three randomly selected adventures and you must pick one to attempt
* If you are able to get to the end of the text adventure you win.

--------------

What happens after the game?

Prizes distribution, winner list and the answer to most questions can be found in the steam group. Please note that this group follows all PIF rules and I encourage everybody to read the sidebar rules or the almost identical set of rules found on the group [home page].(http://steamcommunity.com/groups/redditgiveaway)

-----------------

As it is extremely time consuming for me to come up with these text adventures, I would appreciate any help that you guys might have to offer in coming up with ideas or helping me write some adventures.  If you guys want to help, just let me know via PM. Thanks in advance for those who decide to help me :)


Also as an aside, if ANYONE has copies of 'The Ship' on steam, I would love to trade for them as I have a great plan on using them in my next giveaway.

3) The person I pick is based on their Reddit profile and STEAM profile and then the answer to number 4)

 Now. I've been thinking. Every PiF thread I see has about a billion people just doing the bare minimum to get a free game. I don't dig that. I don't dig it at all.

All of the games I will be PiFfing tonight are Great. some of them have been on sale lately, some of them haven't been.

So here is the deal.

In this Particular PiF, there are TWO games.


One of these games plays like a movie... and you wish the other game WAS a movie. (At least I do.)  One game has murders in it! The Other Game... well, there are a lot of dead bodies in it after a while. 
One game is relatively new... The other Game is a couple of years old. 


Instead of asking you to write a paragraph for this PiF, I'm going to ask you to use your imagination. 

If you were in a video game, What would be your defining tool.  Would you have a sweet ass car? or a bitchin hair style? Utility belt? DESIGNER THONG? 


Whoever I deem to be more creative will be allowed to pick which of these two games he/she will get.  The Second most creative person will get the remaining game. Don't forget to include your Steam account in your response So I can see if you've already got the games in Question. 

Don't worry, If you are REALLY awesome and already HAVE both of these games, We'll talk. I'm not making promises, but we'll see what happens. 

**Edit** You can enter all three of my PiF's, but you will only win one game. Just So's you Know's


**The 'This is almost over' Edit**  This PiF is losing steam, so i'm calling it now.  both winners have been sent a Steam Invite. 

Hex_Avis is the First Winner with his strangely off kilter piggifying Sheep Stick, and Jmarquiso is the runner up with his Pacifism! 


**The Reveal Edit!!** Just in case any of you were wondering what was won by whom! 

Hex_Avis won Just Cause 2! The best grappling hook simulator game in existence. Honestly, I think he got the best of the deal, because Jmarquiso walked away with L.A. Noire, Which is a great game, just nowhere near as much fun as Grappling onto fighter jets!

I have given away a number of Steam games, though. And I've received some gifts from friends as well. But I see it all the time in PIF: someone wins, deletes their posts from that thread, then keeps requesting games. Someone makes new Steam accounts just to beg for more games. Or some are more bold; one guy keeps posting pictures of his puppies (I've counted at least 3 different PIF threads where he posted pictures of his puppies and said something about him deserving the games). This guy even made a request to r/favors asking for free steam games. He's recently won (at least) Super Meat Boy, Defense Grid, Portal, and I didn't feel like looking through more, but every post he makes is for free games. At least he doesn't appear to be trying to deceive anyone, but at some point, people like this need to ""PLAY IT FORWARD."" Now if people want to spend all day begging for handouts, that's their problem as far as I'm concerned. Some people around Christmas were making fake accounts and ""gifting"" to each other (or themselves) in order to appear generous, and then requesting from other people saying ""look what I did for this guy; I'm due for a PIF"". I have honestly given away more than a couple games in PIF, but lately I've only given to people who I know or who are on my friend list. Too many people around here are dishonest and annoying. If I've upset you, that's ok. I'm probably doing you a favor by reminding you that it's not worth your effort to beg everybody for free stuff. And people giving free games: you rock. Seriously, you are kind/generous/awesome. But please do a tiny bit of homework on who you give to. (Unless you don't care, which is your bizniz.)

To win the pif! Gimme an example of a game that really influenced or changed a genre for you that you enjoyed. It could be a classic or something I've never heard of, i'd love to hear about either :)

So you will see a lot of PiF's from me starting tonight, and ending Sunday Evening.
(POSSIBLY MONDAY MORNING I mean, Let's be honest... Canada Day is a day to solemnly stare at a bottle of delicious Canadian Beer and say 'I'm gonna drink the hell out of you while being proud of my Canadianity!)
Now. I've been thinking. Every PiF thread I see has about a billion people just doing the bare minimum to get a free game. I don't dig that. I don't dig it at all.

All of the games I will be PiFfing tonight are Great. some of them have been on sale lately, some of them haven't been.

So here is the deal.

In this Particular PiF, there are TWO games.

One of these games is Old, well loved, and extraordinarily addicting. The Other is Brand Spankin New, and colourful, and puzzly, and I probably just gave it away! Both of them are pretty laid back. 

I love both of them. 

TWO people will win a game in this PiF.  To win, you need to explain to me why you think Casual Gaming has a place in these hectic, FPS laden days. 

I think it's incredibly important... What do you think?

Please include your Steam Account in your response so that I can make sure that I don't gift you a game you've already got. If you write a winning paragraph and you have both games... we'll talk. 


Good luck, laid back dudes. 

**Edit** You can enter all three of my PiF's, but you will only win one game. Just So's you Know's

**Kinda Sad Edit** This Idea isn't taking off as well as I was hoping. the Simple One Game PiF's posted today have already shot by my three multi mystery game giveaways. 


Alas, Perhaps it's back to boring Game Give aways after this. 


**The This PiF Is Almost Over Edit**

I have sent both TotallyGeeky and Mygawd Steam Invites. As soon as Totally Geeky chooses his/her new game, Mygawd will be given the other one.   Thanks for all the entries, guys. :) 

**The Reveal Edit** 

Alright, So I've Hooked TotallyGeeky up with a sweet delicious copy of Quantum Conundrum! (WOOO) 

Mygawd has not answered me either on reddit OR steam, and since I'm impatient, I'm just going to PiF that game away now. in a different PiF. Cause that's how I role.  Thanks for Participating guys!

The winner will be allowed to have any number of games purchased for themselves totalling £40 at the most, as per popular request from the last PiF I did for £35. xe.com reports this as 40.00GBP=62.7147USD so take from that what you will.

STEAM prices aren't quite done with a currency converter though, so please check http://www.steamprices.com/uk which will allow you to browse appropriate prices. I'm afraid my card will deny a purchase through steam using VPN to purchase in USD (I tested it.), so I cannot do this. Apologies.

The rule to enter and win this time is quite simply:

**Tell me the most memorable moment you've had in gaming that will last with you forever.** - It doesn't have to be a GOOD like ""yay gaming is awesome"" moment. It just has to be your most memorable one **and preferably why**.

For example, my moment was one in Project Reality where everything happened with such perfection and amazing mixture of adrenaline and hilarity that I'll never forget it - and something that truly defined how I feel about games now and forever. **I stress that I will not go into detail about my 'moment' here, to not clutter this up, but I hope you do, if you enter.**

The entry I find most interesting will be chosen as a winner at 23:59 PM BST Friday, 22/06/12.

If BST confuses you, http://wwp.britishsummertime.co.uk/ I hope that helps.

You do not have to post your Steam profile here, I will get it from you in PM later should you win.

**EDIT I just came back to find 136 new comments here. This might take a while to read them all...**

**EDIT 2 00:03 23/06/12 wasn't 136 new comments, just neverending reddit being weird. I've read them all and I am making my decision. It's a toughie.**

**EDIT 3 Some very difficult deliberation brought it down to 5 people, who I've chosen out ""of a hat"". The winner this time was cantfeelmylegs. If he does not claim the prize by 23:59 23/06/12, I'll choose someone else of the remaining 4.

That immediately threw a red flag since we are already friends and why does he have a period after his name. Sure enough it was someone impersonating him.

Then they tried to get me to login to the ""Steam Forums"" by linking me to a phishing site.

The way these events occurred, it would seem like a targeted attack towards me, but I want to warn everyone to be careful, especially if a ""mod"" randomly adds you. They may want to impersonate Ali-Sama again or anyone else in this Community.

Always verify the URL before logging into anything. Password managers like Lastpass make it easy, if it was the real steam site, I would already be logged in. Chrome makes it easier to see verified domains in the address bar.

Enable Steam Guard and make sure your passwords are secure and different. Using the same password for steam as your email easily defeats steam guard and you will lose other accounts.

Giving a game to a specific person where nobody else has a chance to win the game is NOT a PiF. You give away something in chat, does not count for points, doesn't matter if it was random or not. We have been too lenient with this and it's sending the wrong message. So let this be the final warning for everyone. If we catch you manipulating the ratio, you aren't getting a second chance anymore. You will be banned.

Here are some examples:

&gt;UserA: Man I really want OrangeBox!

&gt;UserB: Here ya go!

&gt;UserB: Now I'll make a thread on PiF and you enter a comment and I'll make you the winner so I get a point!

&gt;UserA: OK!

**This can get you banned**

&gt;UserB: I have a copy of Battlefield 3 I want to give to my friend, but I also want my point! I know I'll make a fake PiF that looks legit, have my friend enter and pretend a RNG picked him and get the hopes up of 4 other legit users! But my friend doesn't meet the minimums and he hasn't been on reddit for about a year. I know I'll karma whore for him!

http://www.reddit.com/r/playitforward/comments/oh89t/pif_battlefield_3_origin/

**This can get you banned**

&gt;UserA: Oh I want to give my friends games but I want points. I'll just ask some friends to help me out, have them enter for games and pick them as winners!

**This can get you banned**

&gt;UserA: Man nobody is entering my PiF &gt; Enters chat

&gt;UserA: I couldn't give away Red Nation.

&gt;UserB: That sucks.

&gt;UserA: Here you can have it.
&gt;UserB: Cool.

&gt;UserA: Let me make a thread so it could count as points.

**This can get you banned**

Now please don't attack these people, I posted the threads that could easily be found on the sheet so everyone knows what I am talking about.

Other things that get you banned: Trading/Selling games won on PiF or other giveaway subreddits.
Asking for money or donations is strictly against the rules, no matter what your intentions are.

We are excellent at our job, you can't pull a fast one on us. So don't be stupid or you will end up getting banned.

Edit:

**Also First Come, First Serves will no longer give the PiFer points.**

While going through the entries of my [Skyrim PiF](http://www.reddit.com/r/playitforward/comments/o4og0/pif_the_elder_scrolls_v_skyrim/), I was researching every user that had entered. I went to check which games they played forward, which games they had won in other PiFs, and I noticed something while checking to see who actually plays the games they win. Some people who won PiFs did not actually own the games they had won. Looking through their user history, I saw that they had kept the game in their Steam Gift inventory and attempted to trade the game in other subreddits. Those users are now banned.

If you are giving out a game, please take user account history into account. Please research your users to see if they own the games they have won. The [**spreadsheet**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AiFZyanaAvZDdDFNb19TNW1aUGZ0ZFlhaXF2VE1vSmc&amp;hl=en_US/#gid=13) has records of the games people have given out and received as well as links to the original PiFs. If you should come across anyone that does not own games that they have won in previous PiFs, please let us know as well as the game(s) in question. You do not need to go and find proof of any wrongdoing from the person, just report it to us and we will investigate the matter.

**While I understand not everyone has the time to research their users, I encourage everyone who gives out games to try if they are able.**

* Make sure the person doesn't already own the game that he or she is trying to win in your PiF
* Private profiles should be viewed as being suspicious when researching your entrants*
* Trade the game to the person **while you are both online** as opposed to sending it as a gift
* Politely ask the person to ""Unpack"" the game immediately after to avoid any doubt that the person will not try and trade the game away
* Keep the person on your friends list and check your Community page to see if ""X now owns Y""

If the person accepts the trade, then immediately removes you from his or her friends list or if you notice that the person still doesn't own the game you have given them within a reasonable amount of time, please [**report it to us**](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23playitforward) and include the following:

* A screenshot of the conversation (if possible)
* A screenshot of your Steam Gift Inventory History
* The person's **permanent Steam URL** (see **UPDATE** below)
* A link to the person's Reddit account

If you win a PiF, but no longer want the game, please contact the Redditor hosting the PiF and let that person know so that the person can PiF the game to someone else who entered. If you have already received the game, please send it back rather than hosting your own PiF. Doing a PiF with the same copy of a game that you won from another PiF can be viewed as a manipulation of ratio and is an offense that can result in a ban. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this and I hope this will help. Please feel free to ask any questions. I am more than happy to address any of your concerns.

* *I am not saying that everyone with a private profile is bad, just saying more often than not, people with private profiles are more likely to scam you. Also, you don't know what games the person already owns nor the number of games the person has and can't find out if the profile is private. The best way to go about this in my opinion is to just ask the person to leave their Steam profile public for the remainder of your PiF or you will not give that person a chance to win.*

**UPDATE:** As [**SwineHerald**](http://www.reddit.com/r/playitforward/comments/o60qq/announcement_please_report_any_suspicious/c3enxid) has mentioned, it would be a good idea to use [**Steam ID Finder**](http://steamidfinder.com/) to get the person's **permanent Steam URL** which would look something like this: http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198017334732

**UPDATE #2:** I also forgot to mention, if you see anyone using a Steam account shown in the [**watchlist**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AiFZyanaAvZDdDFNb19TNW1aUGZ0ZFlhaXF2VE1vSmc#gid=11), please report it to us and do not PiF the game to that person. Please inform us with both their permanent Steam URL and their Reddit username.

**UPDATE #3:** I realize that this sounds like a lot of work for you who give out games, but honestly all I'm asking for at the very least is for someone giving out the game to just go and make sure that the person redeems it onto their Steam account. Now that I have posted this announcement, I have no doubt that those who try and win only to trade their games will move on to other forums to make trades or will be sure to just PM people about trade offers.",,False,,t5_2s4e5,True,,pokeball,True,t3_o60qq,http://www.reddit.com/r/playitforward/comments/o60qq/announcement_please_report_any_suspicious/,moderator
1325455411.0,38,self.playitforward,nyyxd,[Announcement] Happy New Year - Here is a recap!,42,4,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/playitforward/comments/nyyxd/announcement_happy_new_year_here_is_a_recap/,"So 2011 was a big year for the subreddit. Basically I was appointed as a mod and turned this subreddit what it is today. I'm quite proud of the outcome. I think some of our vets remember what is was like before I came on board, it wasn't pretty. Now I can't take all of the credit, just 90% of it lol. I, no we have a great mod team and I couldn't do it without them.

Anyway, I don't have any hard statistics but there has been a big increase of PiFs since the point system went in place mid last year and that number gets bigger every month.

So far between 12/20/2011 and the time this post was made, 362 PiFs have been reported as complete. I expect the number of games to be at least double that. A finalized count will be completed on next sunday when the eligibility period ends to get the candy cane.

---
**It seems many of you have no idea that there is a spreadsheet.** Look at the sidebar, on top there are 4 buttons, right next to the Rules &amp; Guidelines, it's called [PiF Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AiFZyanaAvZDdDFNb19TNW1aUGZ0ZFlhaXF2VE1vSmc&amp;hl=en_US/#/pifcss/p/right/c/blue). Anyone can view it. It contains all PiFs reported as complete as well as a watchlist that contains usernames and steam accounts of people who are banned or ineligible to enter due to exceeding the ratio limit.

**Yes there has always been a ratio limit.** I recently added that to the sidebar, see #4, but it was always in the [Rules &amp; Guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/playitforward/#/pifcss/p/left/c/orange). The sidebar does not contain every rule, so please read that.

On that note, stuff given in steam chat does not count for points.
---
We have also changed the flair for users who are ineligible and those who broke the rules and are now banned. Banned = Red flair ""0 - 9 | Banned"" will show up if a user is banned and it will have a red background. 

Orange flair ""0 - 5 | Can't Enter or Win"" - These users have exceeded the ratio limit and thus not allowed to enter or win anymore games until their ratio is .8 or higher. Violating that rule is cause for ban. If you see orange flair accounts entering PiFs, report them!

Now the banned guys have been banned from the sub, they can't post but they can still PM. So please still check the watchlist in the spreadsheet.

Users who are warned get a message from us:

&gt;Hello [user],

&gt;We have noticed you have now exceeded the PiF ratio limit put in place, as per rule #2 in the [**Rules &amp; Guidelines**](http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/playitforward).

&gt;You are not allowed to enter anymore PiFs until your ratio becomes .8 or better (as per rule #2).
&gt;Any existing entries must be removed. If you enter another PiF after this warning and your ratio is not .8 or better, a ban may be issued. If you have any questions please check the rules and guidelines.

If that person ignores the warning, they are banned.

TL;DR: New flair for people that are banned or not allowed to enter PiFs until their ratio is improved. Mention of the spreadsheet and sidebar, and some PiF statistics.


---
**Edit: Some clarifications:**

If you PiF to an account that is less than 2 months old it will not count for points. Same goes for accounts with less than 300 combined karma. So PiFers will only get points if the receiver is more than 2 months old with at least 300 karma points to qualify for points. It's not either or, it has to be both. 2 month account with 100 karma does not qualify!

Also any account with orange or red flair should not be picked to win and will not count for points if they do. Orange flair saying ""Can't Enter or Win PiFs"" is over the ratio limit and is violating the rules if they enter or win more pifs.

Also again Packs and Bundles count PER GAME. Read the sidebar and the rules please, it explains all of these things.

Now, for full disclosure I will say that this is a v1.1 cartridge, not a v1.0 copy like a certain hipster crowd will desire. Yes, there were minor revisions along the way to the final v1.3 release of this game (""Green blood!"") but the game play is identical. I will also add that the price is right and I am paying shipping.

I will award this cartridge (picture forthcoming) on Friday afternoon at 6pm PST to the person who can tell the most interesting story about their day. Hyperbole, invention and pure bullshit are welcome. Go!

I am continuing my year of PIF with volume 6! and 
[THIS](http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198002004788/inventory) is what you can potentially win!  Also, I apologize for the let down of the weakest link, as after four trial runs, it was clear that any sort of organization of eight people was next to impossible and nobody ever won anything.  **Also as an aside, if ANYONE has copies of 'The Ship' on steam, I would love to trade for them as I have a great plan on using them in my next giveaway.**

------------------

Here is what happens in this PIF:

* Join my [steam group](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/redditgiveaway/)
* Enter chat room **whenever there is an announcement** that indicates the game is starting.  It will be at a random time almost daily to give everyone a chance at participating. (The announcement should pop up in your steam so you will not miss it if you are online and have joined the group)
* Once you are in group chat, one of two things will happen.  Either I will ask you to find me a link to something (e.g link of the steam profile of someone who has a certain achievement unlocked) or I will invoke the power of the reddit mob!  When this happens, I will paste the link to a random steam user's profile and the it is up to you guys to convince that person to join my friends list on steam and send me a message with your reddit username.  Whomever is the first to come up with either the link or get their username spoken, wins!

--------------

What happens after the game?

Prizes are given out depending on what you already have, your PIF ratio, the difficulty of the task you have accomplished, and in small part your reddit history.

------------------

**Special Notes**


* Pif Rules Apply (Karma / Account Age)
* You must not have the game you win
* Before the prize is given, the above will be verified and you may be disqualified
* In light of rule #13 on the sidebar, I will ensure that any winnings are activated by the relevant account
* The prize list will constantly be modified as trades are made to increase the amount of games I have
* I have RL matters to attend to so the contest may abruptly end at any time.  Although I will try to keep it going for hour long increments.  Thanks for your understanding!
* Last and probably most important, it is **NOT** your right to participate in this giveaway.  Please do not have a sense of entitlement or complain and ruin it for others.  If you have legitimate concerns, please bring them up with me privately.

------------------

**Also, ongoing side mission.  Anyone who gets this steam group (or pif thread) or knowledge about this giveaway to front page of reddit (and I mean a normal front page that a non-logged in user would see) will instantly win either a $50 shopping spree on steam or any game on steam that you choose (no monetary limit)!**

The code for this game comes in 2 parts :

* Players key
* Activation key

I don't really know how you are supposed to get the base installation files, but I guess you won't have too much problems with it. Just look up Blood Bowl LE .iso file, be sure to find the one that is not (pre)cracked as the key I provide you is legit copy.

Once again I warn you that **it does not activate on Steam** but surely there is someone who doesn't care and just want to play the game. Or there is someone who has the pirated version and needs a legit copy?

___

To enter, you obviously must respect the rules of this subreddit and absolutely have to meet the requirements. If you're not familiar with the rules - read the column to the right.

Also tell me:

1. In short - why you want the game?
2. In case of many entries post a number 1-100

I will pick a winner in few days from now, can't really tell if I determine who wins by the answer to #1 or I'll do random.org... I'll PM the winner on reddit with the codes for the game.

**TL;DR** You need to find installation .iso yourself, the key is legit, but doesn't activate on Steam, post why you want it and a number 1-100.

There's...well, there's a lot of things going on that I have no knowledge about (having kept myself in the dark about the game for fear of hype). Anyway, here's what you can do to get your key to the city to return things to normal. You can meet the requirements for eligibility on the side bar for starters. You will need to submit a link to your steam account for ease of transfer. After that you must pass the hero requirement test which I will explain the rules for below.

Rules for this pif are as follows:

1.) Submit a picture of anything Batman related. A picture, a short film, limerick, poem (if you really want to go there), a letter written to resemble a character, a mug, a shirt, whatever.  Note: Please, if it is a picture or something you did not create yourself, give credit (and possibly a link!) to the source/original author. You're not judged any differently from finding something neat and sharing it here.

2.) Tell me what any Batman character means to you. If Joker is the ideal father (in a twisted sort of way, he's the role model you never want to become or something) then put that up. 

3.) Finally, I would like you to know who your favorite character from the universe is and why. 

Note: This does ask for a bit of creativity on parts 2 and 3, but I think that will make it interesting. There's no grading involved, just me measuring who is really paying attention and to generate talk among contestants about different ideals.

Note2: This is JUST for Batman: Arkham City and does not include any DLC.

Contest will run until 7pm on Sunday, May 6th. Time is counted on EST. I think that is it, but I will check back periodically to see if I have missed anything and to see how things are going. Happy gaming!

Whilst there is nothing overtly wrong about this, it can lead to mild confusion for the OP who has to find out which number is closest to it, and also causes number hugging. 

Ie. In a range of 1-1000, User A chooses number ""1"". User B can then decide to use number ""2"" that will hug all numbers above User A, (obviously until someone else takes one).

**TL;DR** What I am suggesting is, that instead of a random number pick, a true raffle is implemented, or at least encouraged.

For example, the first poster would take number ""1"", second poster number ""2"" and so on.

Then when all posts (determined by time limit set by OP) have been posted, OP uses random number generator to produce a number out of the people who have applied. If there were 25 entries, the range would be 1-25. Therefore there is little chance for confusion and everyone is happy.

Obviously this won't affect PIF giveaways where the OP chooses arbitrarily.

**How to get a game:**

Comment here (don't add me on steam), tell me what game you're interested in. Also tell me some other games that you enjoyed, or types of games, and why. Leave a link to your steam profile. I'll try to pick people that I think will enjoy the games. I'll check your play history, so don't lie please!

**Requirements:**

Your steam account must be no less than six months old, you need to have at least a little bit of play time across a few games. Also, if you've given away a game before, your chances of winning a game increase significantly.

**Time:**

Three days from original post. (4/10 -- 7:45 PM EST)

Winners will be added sometime in the days following.

**NOTICE:**

I might not give away all of these games. If, for instance, I don't see anyone who I think would like LIMBO, I might decide to not give it to anyone (yet).

~~**Edit**: I did not expect so many responses, but I love the enthusiasm! It's going to take me a while to sift through all the posts to pick winners (likely Thursday), but in the meantime I will leave this PiF open to entries :) .~~

I joined Reddit on Christmas day last year, and it has been an incredible ride. I've met lots of people from around the world and gotten fascinating perspectives from their cultures. But the most poignant part of my experience here has been how god damn nice you PlayItForward folks are.

So what the hell, I'll step it up too. 25 games to be out in a PiF that **ends midnight of the 25th**, closing out my cakeday with a bang.

Please meet PiF requirements, and **comment with an ordered list** of which games you would like along with **your Steam profile URL**. I've got several copies of some games (a whopping eight copies of L4D2) and it is definitely possible to win more than one of different games, so don't be shy and **ask for as many games as you'd like**! 

* Binding of Isaac **x 4**
* Binding of Isaac DLC **x 3**

I played this game on a whim, and proceeded to sit down for a dozen hours with it over the next few days. The extreme randomization of roguelikes blends with real time Zelda-style action to make a tense RPG that encourages you to explore more of the game every playthrough.

* Chime

The music in this puzzler lets you achieve a sense of zen, slipping into the zone as your block placement brings more of the soundtrack to life. If you enjoyed how the music in Lumines or Dyad enhances the gameplay, you'll enjoy Chime.

* Civilization 5

This game doesn't need an introduction or to be vouched for. One of the kings of the epic turn-based strategy empire-builders.

* Commandos Collection (Commandos 2: Men of Courage, Commandos 3: Destination Berlin, Commandos: Behind Enemy Lines, Commandos: Beyond the Call of Duty)

Classic team-based tactical stealth gameplay. This series was renowned for really pushing that genre forward. There weren't many other games like it, and honestly haven't been many since then to knock it off that pedestal.

* Company of Heroes
* Company of Heroes Gold (base + Opposing Fronts)

""World War II RTS"" doesn't do this game justice. CoH redefined what it meant to be a real-time strategy game. It added FPS tactics (flanking, cover, suppression) to an RTS scene that had up till then been mostly units attack-moving into one another. Fast-paced capture point gameplay, squad upgrades and commander abilities made this game feel wholly fresh and utterly unlike the slow burn of Starcraft.

* Hearts of Iron III

But some people like slow. Grand strategy wargamers like to play the logistics battle as much as they do the tactics game, and this series is best in class.

* L4D2 **x 8**

I've got a whopping **eight copies** of this game for you. Remember that you can only ask for copies for yourself - if your friends want a copy, they'll have to enter themselves!

* Portal

The innovative puzzles in this game were matched only by the black humor that spread virally over the internet. It is also renowned as a gateway game, drawing in many of my non-gamer friends who were enthralled by the care and cleverness that spawned a franchise.

* Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic

I still have trouble explaining why I love this RPG: maybe it was the d20 ruleset, or the character path options. Other RPGs certainly had better conversation systems, deeper plots, more choice divergence...but this game will always have a special place in my heart.

* World of Goo **x 2**

We close out the PiF with another gateway game. Physics games have come and gone, but World of Goo brought a charm that immortalized it as a classic and spawned mobile versions despite its [82% piracy rate](http://2dboy.com/2008/11/13/90/). A joy to play alongside non-gamer loved ones.",Closed,False,,t5_2s4e5,1356657867.0,closed,summer12,True,t3_15e5dz,http://www.reddit.com/r/playitforward/comments/15e5dz/pif_christmas_cakeday_pif_25_games_given_away_on/,

**I have decided to end the PiF a day early. The winner is pull_the_other_one! Congratulations!**

Im_Artest's kind gift of Left4Dead has caused me to realize that Valve is awesome. I mean, I already knew Valve was awesome, but it made me really appreciate how REALLY awesome Valve is. So I thought, time to PiF again!

This time I am gifting the Valve complete pack - that is, every Valve game ever made. The idea is to give someone who has previously not had the experience playing many Valve games to enjoy their complete library.

**Those who already own over 30% of the games included in the pack are ineligible to enter.** Sorry. The whole point is to give someone the joy of owning/playing a lot of games they never previously had.

**To enter you must:**

* [Follow the PiF rules and meet all the requirements.](http://www.reddit.com/r/playitforward/comments/nt9jr/announcement_changes_to_pif_points_and_minimum/) Exceptions can be made to the karma rules for those with high ratios.

* You must [read and follow this announcement.](http://www.reddit.com/r/playitforward/comments/o60qq/announcement_please_report_any_suspicious) Specifically, when I gift you this game, you must open it right away. If I see you gift it, I will report you. If you are entering for a friend, please state that person's Steam Profile.

* Post your Steam profile, which must be over 5 months old and contain at least 5 games.

* You must give me your permanent [Steam Url and/or ID.] (http://steamidfinder.com/) - **People seem to be having a problem with this. (Which means they're not reading the announcement like they're supposed to. Tsk tsk.) Your Permanent Steam ID is one of the following two things: ""STEAM_0:X:XXXXXX"" and/or ""http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/7656119xxxxxxxxxx"". Nothing else is accepted.**

* No Private Profiles.

I will do background checks on all entries. In other words, if all you do day and night is post in PiF to enter contests, the chances of you winning? [Pretty slim.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX5jNnDMfxA&amp;wadsworth=1)

Because of the large nature of the gift, I will be leaving it open for **one week.** Not only does this allow a maximum number of people to enter, it allows me to get my debit card in the mail so I can actually buy the games :p ***UPDATE: Reddit is planning to be down all day the 18th, so I've extended it to the 19th.***

Keep in mind, also, that this PiF will instantly make the blue side of your ratio **rise by about 20 points.** Be prepared for this, and be willing to accept the fact that there's a good chance you'll need to do a ton of PiFs to become eligible to receive games again. I do expect the person who wins this to PiF, although obviously not all at once. (And not necessarily the Valve complete pack either - any games are fine.)

**I reserve the right to ignore some or all of these rules and gift this pack to whomever I see fit. I also reserve the right to impose individual, additional rules upon any user I may gift this pack to. I also reserve the right to take up to 3 days after announcing a winner to get to know the person/research them before gifting the pack. With the mod's knowledge and consent, I reserve the right to reverse the decision regarding who wins the pack should I find the person I choose is not up to my standards.**

That paragraph may seem imposing, but I am a reasonable person and everything will likely go perfectly smoothly. I just want to let everyone know that if things get wonky or appear suspicious that I'll do what I can to make sure the wrong person doesn't get these games.

Many parts of this post were copied and pasted from Im_Artest's [excellent PiF post](http://www.reddit.com/r/playitforward/comments/o6eqm/pifsteamgift_left4dead_goty/). Other parts were slightly modified. Used with permission. (Thanks!)

There may be other rules or conditions that I want people to abide by that I've simply forgotten. If I remember them, I will update this post with them.

I'm not asking for a random number or a story or anything, but the  contents of your comment do and will affect your likelihood of winning this pack - impress me!

P.S. - If anyone would like to perhaps gift me a Valve coupon that I can use towards this, I would greatly appreciate it. I love this subreddit and if I don't get the coupon it won't affect whether I gift or not, but it would make my wallet very happy :)

Instead of messaging the Mods, PiFers please use the sidebar link and fillout the form!",40,8,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/playitforward/comments/njazx/announcement_a_new_way_of_reporting_pifs_instead/,"As some of you know, I am working on a secret project, A PiF web app that will allow easier PiFs. It will allow users to create, edit, and complete pifs. The web app will automatically handle all the work the mods currently do. It will allow PiFers to easily pick winners by instantly seeing the contestants stats, pif ratio, tenure on reddit, games they recieved and given, and even have a algorithim to have a recommended users to win. Plus more features.

Anyway, I was hoping to have that complete by the time the holiday sale started, but I am not finished with it and it's not ready enough even to have a basic version ready. So until that time comes, I have come up with a new way of reporting PiFs completed, which should help during the PiF holiday season.

On the sidebar, the Message the mods link has been replaced with a button: 'Complete A PiF'
That button will take you to a google form to fill out the needed info. You can add up to 16 users for a single PiF. 

If a user has won more than one game, put them in a comma separated list.

PiFers are the only people who should be filling out the form. Leave ununsed fields blank. So if you only pifed to 1 user, leave the rest of the fields blank. Once your information has been submitted, A mod will reivew it and assign the points. There will be no need to message the mods to report a completed pif. Also no need to fill out the form if you are just giving stuff that is not eligible, like guestpasses, beta keys, dlc.

This system will be used until the new pif app is finished, which will likely be early 2012. I'm bad at setting deadlines and when I do they are always highly inaccurate so I won't be more specific than that ;).

If you have any questions, please reply here. If there are any issues, you can still contact the mods. Have a great holiday season and thanks for Playing it Forward!

---
Also for users who PiF 15 or more games between now and Jan 1st, get a special little icon next to their name. The image has not been decided yet, but I am thinking of a candy cane or some other holiday themed one. (Existing PiFs do not count).

Edit: Changed the form, now it supports 16 users, unlimited games per user. Just comma separate the games if a user received more than 1 in the PiF.

Edit 2: The icons, for some reason imgur duplicated 1 icon.

I will randomly choose a person that posted a game I have each day and send them that game.  I will stop giving them away on December 25th so there are 9 games that will be given away

Disclaimer: Game is subject to change if I somehow run out of games people have said.

Edit: I also noticed that some of the gifts I have are not from the autumn sale, but from the Halloween sale instead.  so you can post some of them too if you want them.

Edit 2: for clarification I will be giving away one each day so a total of 9 games should be given out. the reason I say I have 30 gift-able games is because I have that many possible giveaways, making it less of a needle in the haystack sort of situation.

* Day 2: Pudie Received Bastion!

My supposed friend told me he had keys from those cheap that he directly got from a wholesaler and since he's a gameshop owner and a trusted friend (well ,he was) I believed him and bought numerous keys from him at around 10$ each.

I sold quite a good number of them and after discovering this subreddit I decided to give some away cause it looked like a good community (and it is !). First I gave away one, then as I knew people here more I started to give away more since I got a good amount a money from those keys.

Then some weeks ago , with the hack of the steam forum , I stumbled upon that fkn0wned forum. Since this forum had a seller section for games I thought ""hey why not try to sell those keys here"" but then I was shocked by what I saw. (ie the keys being sold there for 2$).

I contacted my 'friend' right away and he assured me the keys didn't come from there. Since he was a trusted friend I still believed him , just going on this forum from time to time to see if there was any update on that matter. (Hence why it was in my bookmark)

A week passed and since no one talked about that forum I thought it was okay and just started giving some away. Then 1 or two days ago , Cult (from steamgifts) made a post on steamgifts forum telling everyone that he'll ban anyone who puts Dead Island or Portal 2 keys saying he'll not accept keys from fkn0wned. That's where I started to freak out quite a lot.

Then today I wake up and I see those two posts on PlayItForward telling about those keys. I was pretty sure at this point that my friend was fucking me the whole time but I still believed that he may be legit a bit. I payed him a visit and then he told me that the keys in fact comes from fkn0wned but he can't give me my money back since he's pretty broke and all that shit.

Since then I managed to go in touch with some known members from this forum. The keys are legit (I dunno how they got them , the only thing I know is that they come from someone in a retailler thingy) , if you won one of my PiF or my giveaways on my stream you won't get your game removed or your account banned , I can assure that.

So yeah I'm feeling pretty shitty now, I wish I had stayed in my bed longer ~_~ , I'm sorry for everyone who entered in my previous PiF. I'll most certainly do others ones during the black friday and christmas sales. 

Keep in mind most of the money I got to make the PiFes came from the selling of those keys. Now that it's impossible to sell them I have no income source anymore apart from the 20€ of pocket money I get each month (Yeah I'm still a 19year-old student that lives with his parent and only gets pocket money ~_~ ) so until I find another thing to sell to make me some money my PiFes are going to be much more limited and I apologise in advance for that.

So yeah , thanks for anyone that took the time to read that long wall of text and I hope it clears everything up.

After winning a copy of portal 2 here on PIF, I just had to do my own.

The winner of this PIF will be able to ask me for any game or games they want off steam with a total price limit of $30. You can choose one $30 game or six $5 games or any combination you would like.
Check those steam sales!

To win this PIF, tell me a time you really helped someone. A time when someone needed help and you jumped up to help them. It does not need to be a serious story like stopping someone from committing suicide. It could be as simple as helping someone with tech support.

**Your reddit account must be over one month old to win.**

~~Winner will be picked on monday.~~ (see edit #4)
Thank you.


**Edit #1** Great response so far! Keep them coming guys. You never know when karma will come back to repay that simple kindness you showed to someone.

**Edit #2** I've read every single comment so far and will continue to. A lot of these are very touching and it is going to be very hard to pick just one winner. It looks like my video card crapped out on me shortly after posting this PIF, so I may not be responding to all of your questions very fast as I need to figure out how to either fix my video card or replace it in order to load up steam and get the winner their gifts on time, but rest assured I will not skip over your post. One of these days I'll get a new computer and stop burning up video cards. One of these days.

**Edit #3** Got my video card working again thanks to the helpful folks here on Reddit. I'm getting some sleep for now but keep those submissions coming! You guys are great! 

**Edit #4** I am changing the end date to tomorrow, Sunday the 30th (one day sooner) so that the winner will be able to get their gifts before the Halloween steam sale is over.



**Final Edit!!!!! The winner of this PIF is [LudwigLobsters](http://www.reddit.com/r/playitforward/comments/lsdqd/pif_steam_any_games_you_want_up_to_30/c2v7w2e?context=3) The way the job market is right now helping a friend get a new job is a huge deal.

It would have made the trolls and beggars run out and earn themselves mountains of Karma to be able to enter. 

And... then I lost my job. So, Suddenly, all of my disposable income is tied up in keeping myself fed, housed, and in school.

It only counts as 1 point, So rest not, weary Mananers Followers... I'm not out to fuck your ratio as hard as I have been before. 

**THE RULES**
1) Read the goddamned sidebar. Please. If you don't read it, and you enter when you are not eligible, I will mock you. I'm in a shitty mood, and I SERIOUSLY don't feel like fucking around. 

2)Upvote this for visibility. 

3) Even Ratios will be given priority. (Yes, 0-0 is an Even ratio.) 

4) **[LINK](http://steamcommunity.com/id/ceebsies)** your steamID

5) Just to make SerGregor Happy, I am going to use Redditraffle... i guess? 


5) Name the best book you've ever read. Tell me why it's good. You don't need to write me a full fledged report. nor do you need to impress me, just do this. I will read every one, but it will not really affect your chances of winning, because... sergregor.

1332458370.0,34,self.playitforward,r94b2,kbinferno's Steam SaG 1: You pick the game you want!,35,1,69,http://www.reddit.com/r/playitforward/comments/r94b2/kbinfernos_steam_sag_1_you_pick_the_game_you_want/,"This community is really great and it has introduced me to a wide variety of different games. I'm always looking for a new game, or a new style, and I've got an idea that's win-win. Here's how I want to give back, in my own fun little way. I plan on doing this more than once, because well, it's awesome!
SaG stands for Suggest a Game. 
&gt;**Well hold up kbinferno how does that work?** Glad you asked, here is how it works. First, link your Steam ID here. Then tell me a game you want to play on Steam. *Tell me it's genre. Tell me how it plays.* Tell me why you love it, tell me why you crave to play it. Make me crave it. Do it. And guess what. I buy us both copies.

&gt;**Woah that's crazy, what's the catch?** Can there even be a catch? It's my way of Playing it Forward. I love videogames, you love videogames. 

&gt;**What if one of us already has the game I crave oh so much, then what, smarty-pants?** Let us keep the teasing to only games you don't own. If for some reason I own the game already, I'll let you know and give you a fair attempt to try again. 

&gt;**What if it's an expensive title? Surely you're not made of money..** Another good point! SaG won't be about how much, although if the title is a more expensive one I'll need to be convinced way more. 

&gt;**Then how much is too expensive?** I'll let you decide. It's not like I have a number in my head, but I'm trying to do this more than once so please consider that :) remember, PiF encourages indie titles, so recommending we both play MW3 might not be your best way to pick up a free copy.

&gt;**When does your SaG 1 conclude?** Another great question! I'll pick a winner Saturday night or Sunday morning. Have fun!

tl;dr? &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;

&gt; EDIT: So I've gotten some feedback, and by some I mean none, that people want to know how I will be choosing the winner? On what rubric? Well there's no scorecard folks, but if I had to assign categories, they would be ""persuasion level, game genre, appreciation (y u post on every PiF this week?), and appetite for lasagna"".

&gt;**EDIT: Thank you for your entries! As of 6:18pm EST on 3/25, submissions are closed and the suggesters of &gt;&gt;Trine 2 and Bastion&lt;&lt; will be notified! From them, one winner will be selected. Thanks again and stay tuned for my SaG 2, around mid-April!**

Hey PiF, and it's time for another giveaway.  I've been having a blast with The Witcher 2 and wanted to share the experience.  

**To win:**  
Just tell me your birthday.  The person whose birthday is closest to mine wins.  If you don't feel comfortable giving the actual date to a bunch of strangers, just pick any random date that is special to you for whatever reason.  Just the month and day, **no year needed.**  

*  You must be eligible to win per the subreddit rules.  

*  I have never mentioned my birthday on reddit, so no use digging through my account (I've commented at least 20 times a day for over 3 years, so good luck if you decide to anyways).  

*  You may choose whether you want it on Steam of GoG (DRM Free).  It's up to you!  

*  This post will be open for 24 hours.  I will contact the winner at that point.  You will have 8* hours to respond to my contacting of you.  If you don't respond within 8* hours, I will choose the next closest person.  PLEASE DON'T ENTER if you aren't going to online 24 hours from now give or take a couple hours.

In order to be eligible to receive the account you must:

* not be a new member (I'm not going to give this to a week old account)

* have done a PIF of your own (given away a game)

* agree to add something to the account and pass it on at the end of Feb.

If anyone else would like to donate to the account I'm sure the future owners would appreciate it, and it could also be a way to become eligible for the account yourself.

Simply post a link to your steam id, (DO NOT POST THE GAME OF YOUR CHOICE, I SHALL REQUEST UPON YOU WINNING), and answer this simple question/exercise; If you could be stranded on an island for 6 months with any 5 people, fictional or real and famous, who would they be, and why? I shall pick the winner on Friday 10th of this month... around about 10 pmish UK Time... I will be nude... and eating Chocolate :D AND NO WILL NOT SHAVE YOUR KITTEN

My personal stance (My views will not effect the decision i make on Friday, i am looking for variety, interesting mix ups, and the all important; which of your choices will make me think twice about my own choice) Mr Bear is not all that special, just a glorified boy scout. And secondly, if im stranded for six months, why worry about sex? Its only six months, when you return you can have amazing return sex and then recall your stories to friends!

You can [friend me on steam if you want](http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198016153191), but I don't believe it's necessary to gift the game (I would need your email address in that case).

Good luck!

The winner will be allowed to have any number of games purchased for themselves totalling **£35 at the most.** Currency converters currently state that around $56, if you're not sure and want a comparison.

STEAM prices aren't quite done with a currency converter though, so please check http://www.steamprices.com/uk which will allow you to browse appropriate prices. I'm afraid my card will deny a purchase through steam using VPN to purchase in USD (I tested it.), so I cannot do this. Apologies.

The rule to enter and win this time is quite simply:

**I want to know something you hate about games or gaming, that you think is somewhat unique to you, and explain why.**

Doesn't necessarily have to be a genre or a gaming cliché. 

For example, I absolutely *detest* Bioshock - quite an unpopular opinion most gamers would agree. Shan't get into reasons here, but I hope you do with your entry - I'd like the winner to at least explain why they think this is a unique opinion to themselves.

The entry I find most interesting will be chosen at 23:59 PM BST tomorrow, 16/05/12.

If BST confuses you, http://wwp.britishsummertime.co.uk/ I hope that helps.

THE NEXT CONTEST IS LIVE NOW!**

Hi everyone!  

I am continuing my year of PIF with volume 4!  I have learnt a lot about what you guys like and dislike in my previous PIF posts and this one takes all the feedback I have received into account.  As stated previously, all my PIF posts will have contests or tasks that will remain open for 15 days ~~with MULTIPLE winners daily.~~ (This one will have one winner daily)

[THIS](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0An9wNJsgKPBYdDdtQTZ3ZV94ekI4QUZIX3AtVkxtUmc&amp;hl=en_US#gid=0) is what you can potentially win!

Till April 30, I am working over 70hrs a week and do not have the time for elaborate PIFs of the past.  When I have more time, I will resume the more complicated PIFs

------------------

Here is what happens in this PIF:

* Join my [steam group](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/redditgiveaway/) (OPTIONAL FOR THIS PIF - but may enable you to participate in random giveaways)
* Post a caption for the picture of the day (you can find this below) as a **TOP LEVEL COMMENT**
* Please refrain from other top level comments unless *prefaced* by **/not entering**
* If you are not entering, please do not also provide a caption
* Only one top level comment per person please
* If you are declared the winner, add me as a friend on steam to claim your prize. (The prize will be decided by me based in part on your steam rating / ratio / games currently owned by you on steam)
* I will try posting an identical PIF post every day with a different picture, and will leave them open for entry for 24-48 hours.



--------------

**Special Notes**


* Pif Rules Apply (Karma / Account Age)
* You must not have the game you win
* Before the prize is given, the above will be verified and you may be disqualified
* The prize list will constantly be modified as trades are made to increase the amount of games I have
* I may have RL matters to attend to so posts may occasionally be late or winners may not be announced on time.  Thanks for your understanding!
* The previous event(s) are over. Please do not have a sense of entitlement or complain about your banked points.  You had the option to use them and you yourself chose to save them for later, with no guarantees when this would happen.  70+hrs a week is no joke and most everyone was unwilling to host the event on my behalf

**Also, ongoing side mission.  Anyone who gets this steam group (or pif thread) or knowledge about these series of giveaways to FP of reddit (and I mean a normal FP that a non-logged in user would see) will instantly win SKYRIM!**

Also, users with orange/red flairs are not eligible for points should you PiF a game to them. Those with an orange flair either have a bad ratio or have been labelled as ""serial requesters"" by a moderator. The [watchlist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AiFZyanaAvZDdDFNb19TNW1aUGZ0ZFlhaXF2VE1vSmc#gid=11) would also be a good thing to look at when researching the people who enter your PiFs.

Additionally, the **Official /r/PlayItForward Steam Account has been handed down from sevenalive to LordCukraaz**. This means that when you see ""r/playitforward"" in chat, please do not confuse it to be sevenalive.

Thank you for your understanding.

**UPDATE:** The red text at the top has been changed and now states **""PiFers must give to users older than 2 months with at least 300 karma to receive points.""** The 300 karma can come from anywhere, as long as the combination of your link karma and comment karma are at least 300, you need not worry. Hopefully, this will end any further confusion regarding PiF points. Thank you.

**UPDATE #2 (REGARDING EXCEPTIONS):** If you have done PiFs in the past, if someone were to PiF a game to you now despite having less than 300 karma, that person would still receive a point. The rule wasn't meant to hurt legitimate people, we just wanted to help weed out the alternate accounts and serial requesters.

**UPDATE #3 (REGARDING THE ""HARSHNESS"" OF THIS RULE):** The rule may seem like much, but consider the recent events that occurred during the Steam Winter Event. People were creating multiple accounts using IndieGala Bundles as a way to allow those accounts to win prizes. They manipulated the system and ended up getting more gifts from the gift pile than any other regular Steam user. This happened because Valve failed to put any sort of restriction aside from having a paid game on the account in order to qualify for getting prizes throughout the event.

We noticed that an abuse of our system was occurring with people creating alternate accounts and just waiting for two months in order to use them to enter numerous PiFs. Others have gotten more deceitful by deleting their past PiF entries in order to mask that they are serial requesters. I'm sure the community wouldn't want a bunch of alternate accounts created like this entering all the PiFs people are creating. After this rule was implemented a while back, us mods noticed that a lot of low activity accounts and two month accounts with no karma (both possible signs of an alternate account) were not entering PiFs at such a rapid rate.

Thanks so much for being a part of the PiF community. We're now over 2,000 readers thanks to a recent campaign on reddit that [tricked people into coming here](http://www.reddit.com/r/playitforward/comments/hvze0/i_was_tricked_into_coming_here/), which is very exciting!  
  
As everyone knows, or at least has seen evidence of, we recently began handing out [badges](http://www.reddit.com/r/playitforward/comments/hgtzn/badges_introduced_to_pif_for_members_who_have/) to people who have PiF-ed. The mods are wondering if we should tweak how we give out bages, and we'd like your input. We've noticed a few things that make us raise our eyebrows:  
  
* There are some *brand* new accounts that pop up and do a valid PiF on a low-cost game which makes us wonder whether they're just laying the ground work to continually request. These accounts generally only have activity in this sub at the time of account creation.   
2. Related to #1 above we have seen some accounts do a low-cost PiF and then serially request games. This is hard to police because 10 requests might lead to no games, so we don't want to immediately villainize anyone, but it does make us wonder.   
3. There has also been a rise in PiF-ing low cost mobile games, which also makes us wonder whether gifting someone a $1 game should be considered ""badge-worthy"".  
  
Anyway, some of that is making us think how can we rethink the badge system. We've thought about changing the PiF requirements to be a little bit tougher to obtain. We'd like to hear your thoughts about some of these possibilities:     

1. Should we make badges harder to obtain? If so, how? We were thinking perhaps a badge should be tied to multiple PiFs. If we do this, how many is multiple? 2? 3?  
2. Should length of reddit membership play a role? This helps the fight against accounts committed to requesting, but may screen out lurkers who really want to join the community.   
3. Should we have two levels of badges? If we go this route, we thought we'd keep the current Fallout 3 badge, but add a ""gold-level"" badge that fits a more stringent criteria (e.g., multiple PiFs, certain length of account, etc.).   
4. Should cheap mobile games count towards a badge? What about super cheap Steam games, like when *The MisAdventures of P.B. Winterbottom* was $.50 last year? My personal inclination is towards ""no"" since at that point the cost of entry is so low you're not really helping anyone overcome a spend barrier, and the money has limited utility for the developer, but my word/belief may not be in line with the community.  
  
So, bottom line, we're looking for input. We want to moderate this sub as best we can and we need your feedback. Also, as a side not regarding whatever we do with badges, they are not granted immediately, but will usually come within a week of whatever criteria we ultimately decide. Thanks everyone!

I hate seeing these gems just lying around on my account not being played.
Would prefer giving only one game per person, and would also prefer you friending me on Steam instead of just giving a random email.

If you want to do something for the game you could visit my youtube-channel where I do some Let's Plays from time to time, and give me some constructive criticism about how to make my videos better (Note: Not how to get more views, I don't care about the views. I just wanna make better content). :)

Hopefully I don't fuck this process up too royally or breach the standard procedure in some inconceivable way.

It's a rather bizarre game that I like quite a bit and I thought someone else might want to experience.

Now I think this is the part where I pick some wacky, arbitrary way to pick a winner.

Also, let me say that I know you *can* gift games on Steam, but have never done the act myself (and I just noticed that phrasing makes it sound *dirrrrty*), so the winner will have to give me a rundown on that ;)

To be honest, I don't think I even used Steam before coming to the PiF community- nor had I legitimately bought ANY non-WoW PC games for the past 2 or so years. 

PiF has changed all of that. Every game on my laptop right now is legit and purchased either by myself or as a PiF- and I've gifted at least 8 games to friends, and 2 through PIF. It's also had the positive effect of getting me into new games I've never heard of before, saving me a TON of money on going out to bars, and meeting some great people in the community. Not to mention, I am now giving developers the money that they deserve to make a great, enjoyable game.

I just wanted to let all of you guys (and gals!) know how this subreddit turned a pirate into an honest person.

These games were a bit of a renaissance for me, a halcyon to the days where I enjoyed games a lot more than I do now. I have a bit of a problem now where I can play a game and appreciate it at face value, but I just don't enjoy them anymore regardless of how great of a game it is. I have a hard time even pretending to enjoy myself unless the game is actively inhibitive to any sort of casual playstyle, and has a very high skill ceiling (DoTA 2) unless I'm playing with friends.

But Alan Wake was the exception!

The Witcher 2 was a healthy nod in the right direction, and by far one of my favorites of the decade, but it was Alan Wake that I came to truly appreciate for what it was. Alan Wake is one of the very few games I've actually felt compelled to come back to again and again. The story has a few holes and the face geometrics could be a little better, but Alan Wake has by far been the best game I have played in years.

It's on sale already, but this game is fucking fantastic. Because I want both of these to be available to anyone and everyone that can't afford it, I'll be giving away an infinite amount of copies to whoever would like a copy and meets the requirements for the next 24 hours.

Oh, and you have to draw me a shitty wizard.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

**Giveaway is over! Alan Wake users will start getting friend requests in the next few hours.**

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

~~To the folks that want The Witcher 2, I will be waiting until the 21st to start giving them out as The Witcher 2 has been neither a daily sale nor a flash sale, and so will probably end up being lower within the next few days.~~

[**Fate of the World**](http://www.desura.com/games/fate-of-the-world) It's a management simulator. It's also a look at the various crises that could affect people in the next couple hundred years. It's depressing, hard, and a bit controvesial too.  

[**Frozen Synapse**](http://store.steampowered.com/app/98200/) A turn-based tactical shooter. The interesting part is that both players give orders to their troops, and then once they are done, all orders for the turn are carried out simultaneously. Mechanically, it reminds me of the 1994 board game, [Robo-Rally](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/18/roborally) which is a personal favorite of mine.  

[**Garry's Mod**](http://store.steampowered.com/app/4000/) Physics sandbox in Valve's Source engine. You can do and make whatever your want. Honestly, you should just google Garry's Mod as see the wonderful and weird things people have done. Spaceships, race courses, giant rube goldberg machines, medieval siege weaponry, and that is just the tip of the iceberg. Interesting footnote: the creator got into a bidding war with Notch on one of the humble bundles for top donation.  

[**Gratuitous Space Battles**](http://store.steampowered.com/app/41800/), or [**Gratuitous Tank Battles**](http://store.steampowered.com/app/205530/) You customize your spaceships/tanks, deploy them in varying amounts on the battlefield in the places you want, and start the battle. The AI takes control of both sides, and you get to watch the pretty explosions. It's interesting. They've taken the exciting part of strategy games, and made a game solely based around that. At the same time, by removing the player from the actual battle, we have a game where skill isn't remotely tied to micromanagement or ""clicks per minutes"", and no player can use movement related exploits to gain an advantage.  

[**Hydrophobia: Prophecy**](http://store.steampowered.com/app/92000/) A 3rd-person cover based shooter where emphasis is placed on water-filled environments. That statement doesn't make it sound appealing, I know. The interesting thing about this game is in how they've made movement in the water flow so gracefully compared to other games. The other interesting part is the physics engine for the water, and how water flows from one area to another when you do something like open a door in a water-filled room into a (previously) dry one. It's not the most realistic of engines, but it was unique. 

[**Grotesque Tactics: Evil heroes**](http://store.steampowered.com/app/46450/) as recommended [in this comment below](http://www.reddit.com/r/playitforward/comments/wbg6h/pif_various_indie_games_in_alphabetical_order/c5bxuk3) by DizzyEevee.

**Rules to Enter:**

* Write an acrostic poem for the game  you want. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrostic)

* The acrostic poem's outline is based on one word in the game's title, so for Dungeon Defenders you write either using the word ""Dungeon"" or the word ""Defenders"", etc.

* The poem must relate to the game somehow and be grammatically legible

* Only one entry, one game per redditor!

Note: There isn't a minimum on how many words per line, but poems that are longer than one word per line have a greater chance of being selected. Basically, quality poems &gt; flimsy poems.

Edit- This is what an acrostic poem looks like guys: http://imgur.com/1nCpU

I had a lot of fun with my last PiF (the grab bag surprise.) And I'll be honest, the idea kind of came to me while I was sitting there staring at my inventory, specifically, bad rats... and thinking 'God. nobody is going to take that game. Ever. 

So I sweetened up the deal with some other games that I genuinely enjoyed, and I gave them all away to one lucky individual. 

Now i'm kind of interested in doing something like that again (I've got an inventory full of games that I really enjoy, not a bad rat in the lot of them... 

BUT, and this is the kicker... I want to do what's best for this Subreddit.  I really like what you guys do here. (which is why I swoop in every now and then and throw games into the community, to share the joys of gaming with the needy.) 

But to do what's best for the community, I need to think about how i'm doing things. 

So to you, Community, I ask the question. How do you feel about giveaways where one person gets a bucket full of games? 

Would you prefer I space out my generosity? or are you alright with big give-aways (when I can afford them) and silly gimmicks like not knowing what games you might get? 


Let me know how you feel, and tomorrow night, I will do another PiF. 

(if this seems rambly and weird, I just had a long horrible day at work, I couldn't play TF2 with my friends, and It's way past my bed time and I was all 'I want to do a PiF' and... ugh.)

No giving bonus games without the complete bundle.

Indie Gala:
&gt;In no place we state any particular rule on the use our customer do with the purchased keys.
&gt;As long as they do not do commercial use, they have any right on it.

&gt;We have no opinion in this matter. 
&gt;We do not encourage our users to giveaway single keys, but we have no rule that forbid them to do so.

&gt;We simply never thought about it.

Humble Bundle:
&gt;Thanks for reaching out. Our official stance on splitting up bundle games is pretty much our best explanation of the subject:
http://support.humblebundle.com/customer/portal/articles/243192-if-i-already-have-a-game-s-in-the-bundle-do-i-have-the-ability-to-gift-the-extra-copy-in-the-bundle-

&gt;In situations like this, I typically like to give the gentle reminder that a gift key is like a full bundle, but designed explicitly for gifting. It grants access to the same games as a regular key, and is pay-what-you-want down to $0.01 (or $1.00, if Steam keys are necessary). The whole Play it Forward concept is quite excellent, and hopefully the gift key option works hand-in-hand with the ethos of helping out your fellow gamers (while supporting game developers and..)

IndieRoyale:

&gt;We haven't written a rule, but you are correct we don't support or endorse this. The bundle's cost around $5 dollars and we always pick games we enjoy and which are worth far more than the minimum. Therefore sharing keys really is poor form when the cost of buying your own bundle is so low.

Hi everyone!  My [previous PIF](http://www.reddit.com/r/playitforward/comments/o0jav/pif_possibly_the_biggest_steam_giveaway_contest/) ended up being a little underwhelming due to a lack of participation and attendance.  That being said, there is no reason to worry because I intend to treat that as a practice run... 

I have decided that 2012 will be the year of PIF.  I will do one PIF on the first and fifteenth of every month for the rest of 2012.  What is up for grabs?  [ALL OF THIS!](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0An9wNJsgKPBYdDdtQTZ3ZV94ekI4QUZIX3AtVkxtUmc&amp;hl=en_US#gid=0)

Here is what you need to do for this PIF.  Anyone who beats me in a one on one match of [Cultris 2](http://gewaltig.net/cultris2.aspx) will win a game from that list, decided by random number generated in  the above spreadsheet.

How do you participate?

* Join my [steam group](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/redditgiveaway/)
* Enter chat room.  (If I am in there, wait for a number.  If not, try again another time.  I will make announcements in the group whenever I enter chat)
* Make sure your name in-game is the same as steam
* Once your number is called, enter the 'Reddit' server of the game and try to beat me
* One win per 24 hour period.  If you lose, join the back of the line to retry!

You can watch the livestream of the games [here](http://www.livestream.com/ishikaro).

Each game lasts around 90 seconds so the wait time will not be that bad.  You can download the game from [here](http://gewaltig.net/cultris2.aspx) as well as play online right from your browser!

Fourteen winners so far....

Hey PIF'rs,

Its that time again!  I have loaded up my steam inventory with games I thought I would play, games I thought I would gift and games I was suckered in to buying packs of for no reason! 

So here goes!

Second, post your Steam ID so I can scrutinize your account even further. Then comes the meat of the challenge. Remember in elementary school when you had to write stories as a group, taking turns writing a sentence each? Yeah, we're doing that and I'll be damned if there aren't some dragons involved. So take turns writing sentences to cobble together a story. Feel free to post multiple sentences if you like, but have them be separated by at least one other person's response. (i.e. don't post 7 times to have your own paragraph) I will take the quality of responses as well as the nature of your reddit and steam accounts into account when determining a winner.

I will choose a winner Monday 5/14 some time between say 5-12pm EST. That way you all don't forget to do something nice for your mother on Sunday. 

One last thing...yes you've seen this before...indiesanta did this for overgrowth. Best of luck, have fun!

Now I'm gonna change up the rules a little since Assassin's Creed III is a new game and I'm sure a lot of people will want it.

1) Standard PiF rules (be eligible, post a link to your Steam profile, post a number **between** 0 and 501).

2) Let me reiterate: you *might* have to register a UPlay account, so don't enter if you aren't willing to make one.

3) In addition to posting a link to your Steam profile, write three sentences about something. Write something funny, or something serious. Write about what you ate for lunch, write about why you want this game, write about a dream you had... I don't care; just write something. I don't want people to think they can just drop off a number and their Steam profile and think that's good enough to be considered for a brand new AAA game.

For a time limit... how about we do 48 hours?

However, I will give you the choice out of three:  Terraria, Cthulu Saves the World, or Breath of Death VII.  I know, may not be the best, but it's what I've got right now.

Like the title says, I want to help out someone who is struggling to buy a Christmas gift for their kid.  All you need to do is tell me why *your* kid is the best (because you know they are) and deserves one of these games (because you know they do), and post a picture of your kid with a handwritten note with your reddit name and the date.  I would also like you to explain why you don't have the finances to provide for them the way you want to, but I know this may me a sore spot for some so I won't require it.

Any proof beyond that is great, but I know it may be hard to provide depending on the situation, so it's not necessary.   I understand if you don't want pictures of your kid floating around online, so feel free to block out the face.  I just need to tell that you are doing this for your kid and not trying to get a free game for yourself.

Siblings, aunts/uncles, family friends, and anyone else is can enter, as long as the child you are entering for might be going without/very little otherwise.  I know these may not be the best kid games, so feel free to enter for an adult, just understand that a kid/teen will have a better chance of winning.

I'll check back tomorrow, and post the winner when the thread slows down (assuming it picks up to begin with) and I feel everyone has had a chance to enter.  When all is said and done, I'd love if I could get a picture or video when they get it so I can see how happy I made them, but again, I know you might not want pictures of your kids online.

EDIT:  Not that there have been many entries, but no one has been posting pictures, so now I'm going by the honor system.  I don't want to look like a creep, I just want to make sure that the game actually goes to someone who might not be getting a present otherwise.

TL;DR:  I want to give one of either Terraria, Cthulu saves the World, or Breath of Death VII to you if you will give it as a Christmas present to someone who might otherwise be going without, or at least if you will be unable to give a present.  **Does not have to be a kid, but someone who is entering for a kid or teen will have a better chance of getting the game.**  I would like some explanation as to why they may not be getting anything else or why you are unable to get them something yourself, as well as some sort of proof (such as a picture of the child in question with a handwritten note with your reddit name and the date) but will no longer require it for entry (although I may snoop around in your user history for confirmation).",,False,,t5_2s4e5,True,,,True,t3_n60h3,http://www.reddit.com/r/playitforward/comments/n60h3/im_looking_for_someone_who_cant_afford_a/,

Re: Release of materiel to a worthy Guardsman

Hello, recruits! Since I've deeply enjoyed the Warhammer 40k games, Dawn of War, Dawn of War II, and Space Marine, I'm going to be passing one of them forward while I've got the opportunity.

All the regular [PiF] rules apply, but I want you to write me something from the Warhammer 40,000 universe. Share a snippet or a tale from your favorite Dark Heresy or Rogue Trader game. Tell me a story of a hard-won (or lost) battle with a friend. Make up some interesting fluff. Whatever you come up with, I want to read it!

I'll be trading the game on Steam, please let me know which one you'd like to be writing for, and get to it!

Please be advised, this PiF will end on Sunday at roughly 5:00 PM EST.

Rules and stuff:  


* You shouldn't be a scammer or a serial requester. I will not give any game to suspicious accounts. Newly created accounts (&lt; 3 months) or accounts with low activity have a low chance of winning. People who have made their own PiFs have a better chance. People with positive ratios have the highest chance.  
* You shouldn't have an orange or red flair by the time I'm picking the winners.  
* You can enter for multiple games.  
* Include your steamid in your comment like this: [http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198003923806](http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198003923806), preferably as a link. You can get that url from steamrep.com. Please use the same format as I did, it's too much work for me to convert all the links to that format.   
* I'd prefer to give the packs &amp; bundles to someone whose ratio wouldn't be hurt too bad. This is not written in stone though, if you don't mind about getting an orange flair immediately after receiving the pack, I don't mind either.  
* I will make a list of every single user who entered, then filter it out, then choose the winners and announce them here.  
* Winners will be sent their games when we are both online on steam.  
* Tell me which game you're entering for, and why you want it. This may increase your chance of winning, regardless of your ratio.   
* (Optional) Make a comment about the game you're entering for. This can be one or two sentences. An interesting comment will increase your chance of winning as well.     


I will keep this running for about a week. Probably more if not every game gets picked by someone eligible.



**Please note that the games in bundles and packs cannot be given separately, and the games you already own which are in the packs will go to waste once you redeem it. You cannot get the bundle, gift the games you already have and keep the rest for yourself, steam does not allow this.**  

**DOWNVOTING ENTRIES WHO ASKED FOR THE SAME GAME AS YOU DID WILL ONLY MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU TO WIN. I WILL GO THROUGH EVERY SINGLE COMMENT BEFORE CLOSING THE THREAD, THERE'S NO WAY YOU CAN HIDE SOMEONE ELSE'S ENTRY. I WILL NOT LOOK AT THE COMMENT SCORE EITHER.  
I AM POSTING THE LINK TO THIS THREAD TO [STEAM CHAT](steam://friends/joinchat/103582791431386665#/pifcss/p/left/c/purple) AND OTHER PLACES AS WELL SO DOWNVOTING THE THREAD WON'T AFFECT ANYTHING EITHER**  

~~Edit: If I didn't reply to your comment yet, this means I will reply when I am creating the list of entries :) I'm replying only to the people who didn't enter for now so that I don't miss out on anyone when I'm creating the list :)~~ The number of entries weren't as much as I expected so I didn't need to make a list :P


EDIT: Since I'm not getting as many entries as I thought I would, I decided to close this earlier than I planned. No one entered for Best of Underground and KranX Complete Pack so I'm waiting until tonight (about 12 hours) before I close the thread and announce the winners. Please enter only for these two packs from now on, or I'm gonna have to buy a couple of more games and make another PiF :P

Reminder: you can no longer receive points for PiFing in chat, it must be done on the subreddit.

On to other news, we caught another user trying to trade the games he won on PiF in gameswap. It is recommended you either open trade when you are both online, or send as a gift when both online. Then check their owned games to see if they redeemed it. If they don't redeem the game, that is a big red flag and should be reported to the mods.

So I humbly ask you post the Steam coupons over at [r/steamcoupons](http://www.reddit.com/r/steamcoupons) or use the [Steam Coupon Thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/playitforward/comments/nkry0/steam_winter_coupon_thread/)

Also I'm not sure many people realize the restrictions of these coupons. They only can be used until after the sale and can't be used for any games released after the sale. It's only good for 3 months. Almost all of the sale deals are better than the coupons. So people are better off buying the game during the holiday sale, unless the coupon is 75% off.

As for the humble bundles, you can give them in the [Humble Bundle Thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/playitforward/comments/nkbgi/the_unofficial_humble_bundle_3_pif_thread/) or [/r/RandomActsOfGaming](/r/RandomActsOfGaming).

Also a reminder, You do not have to create a new thread to PiF a game. If you have a game you want to PiF and you see a thread already giving a copy of it away, you can always use that thread and pick a winner from it. That will help more PiFs stay on the FP while they are still running. Just reply to a comment in the thread offering the game and have them reply to you saying they got it. Then report the PiF as normal and use your comment permalink as the thread url to the PiF.

Hope that makes sense. Happy Holidays!

So I have had a bunch of games in my Steam inventory. I think now it is time to get rid of them. I divided the 21 games into 12 chances to win. Why 12? Because it is 21 backwards :D (I live a sad, sad life)

To receive a game, please put your 1st, 2nd, and 3rd preferences from the numbered list below. In one to two days, I will put an edit saying ""No more entries"" and will then assign participants a number. I will then use a random number generator to pick winners.

If there is only one person wanting an item from this list, they will automatically win it. If it is not their first choice, that person will remain in the drawing.

As many of you probably already know, steamgifts.com was launched last night. The site looks great and they already have more members than PiF. I've been in contact with the creator over steam and he seems like a very nice guy. I wish him much success and fortune.

Unfortunately, this makes the PiF website somewhat redundant, and I have to halt development on it, probably indefinitely. As you may or may not know I have arthritis in both my wrists and I'm an independent developer so my time available to projects is very limited. I think the steam and game gifting communities needed something like this, and steamgifts.com got there quicker.

There's a PiF happening right now with some referral codes available I believe, if anybody wants in. The site could use some improvements but I'm very impressed by what I've seen so far.

Anyway, thank you to everybody who had suggestions or time to help me test the website. I appreciate all your help.

FTR, PiF is not dead or going anywhere, but the website idea pretty much is. We'll still be around gifting games forward for as long as there's at least two members to do so, but it looks like it will stay housed here in reddit for the conceivable future.

Two excellent PiF's today, http://www.reddit.com/r/playitforward/comments/gm9sb/giving_away_portal_2/ and http://www.reddit.com/r/playitforward/comments/gmacn/pif_hl2_and_episode_1/

Unfortunatey, both of these PiF's were gifted (one with random number, one on purpose) to user davidjeong95. The user account was created an hour ago and has no history except three comments on the two PiF threads. The user even states in their second comment ever ""I've been PiFing a lot of games"" which is either a lie or referring to a previous account.

This might just be me, but I'm less than optimistic about this user's chances of coming back and contributing to our community. In order to keep the community strong it's important to gift to those who are likely to Play it Forward.

I wanted to post this to get some feedback. A random number generator is a fine solution to picking a winner but it makes it more likely for a leecher to snag it up. In the second case a little checking would have invalidated the user's claim.

Do we need stricter rules for participation? I know better tools for tracking user history would be useful and the website will be progressing once more after a hiatus to launch my website and another project I'm working on.

Anyways, I purchased 7 copies of Trine and 11 copies of World of Goo (which is odd considering I've never played the games before) with the intent of giving them away.  That's when I found this place...

All I ask is for a PM or a post below with the email address/Steam username, the game you would like and why you'd be interested in playing it.  I'll try to be around later to hand out copies at random to anyone who seems like a legit redditor and a friendly person.

Hopefully everyone doesn't already have a copy :)

EDIT 1: Managed to fall asleep and now I need to be at work so sorry for the delay.  I'll read the rest of the PM's and comments tonight and hand out the rest of the Steam keys then.  I wish I had enough copies for all of you!  At this point everyone is very interested in Trine so those keys will probably be spoken for but I still have plenty WoG.  Thanks for your patience!

EDIT 2: All Trine copies have been assigned!  WoG still available.  Also, is there a way to send a copy of a game to someone who hasn't accepted me as a friend on Steam but still using the Steam username?  Because if not, it sounds like asking for an email address in the future would be easier.

[Here's a link](http://redditraffle.com/) to a raffle site for Reddit I've been working on.

I'm cross-posting it here because this great community gets a lot of raffles.

Raffling on reddit can be a big pain, since you usually have to pick a number, and OP has to random it, and find your number. This can cause a lot of problems if you're late to the party, or want minimum age/karma requirements (to prevent alts).

If you're holding a raffle, please use my site instead of making people pick random numbers! It's kind of a pain for both the participants to pick numbers, especially if you're late to the party and have to find one that's not taken.

This site automatically detects multiple entries. If you post more than once, you will only be entered **once**. The raffler may choose to use filters to *only* enter comments with ""entering"", or not enter comments with ""not entering"" (for example, these filters may be any character/words). You may also specify minimum comment/link karma, and account age. Once again, these are filters for the raffler to specify himself.

Do let me know what you think, either here on Reddit or via the [contact form](http://redditraffle.com/contact.html).

Does your name start with today's letters, you've given more than 11 games either here or in /r/SteamGameSwap and you have a very positive ratio? Alternatively, are you a mod of either of these communities? Congrats. You will receive free games from me - as a thank you for you service to the community. And it won't cost you any pif points. Make a comment below, so we can have a conversation and I can find out what games/genres you're interested in.  

This includes (but is not limited to) **DizzyEevee, CallowMethuselah,** and **Deyona**. Others who may have missed out from my previous posts, like **Ahrk** are also welcome.


*Part 2.*  
So many questions - all things I'm considering doing, not asking for the sake of asking.  
*What am I allowed to do?*  

* If I gave away a couple copies of the potato sack or similar bundle with extras, could I ask that the recipients give away most of the extras to others in the post I make?
* If I give away a game that has TF2 pre-order items, can I ask for those items to be traded back to me? On the one hand, it is asking for something, but on the other, it means that the recipient can't try and profit from selling them.
* I know that you can enter for a friend as long as you name them, but I wouldn't mind giving out two copies of a game that is meant to be played multiplayer, and letting the winner decide which of their friend's gets it - although that Pif would be worth 2 points instead of 1. Can I do that, or no?
* Are solving logic puzzles asking too much as an entry? What about asking people to leave a reddit PM to a friend of mine, wishing they have a lovely day?

*What are you guys up to?*  

* Is there going to be another event for the steam summer sale like the candy canes for the steam christmas sale?
* Do you want some 18 x 18 images done up for it?
* Pif seems to be a pre-fix, an noun, a verb, and occasionally a adjective. No specific question, but any comments?
* Do you have a list of your top 50 contributors or something? Or even a list of redditors with flair. It'd make my life a little easier, but I can totally understand why it would be bad if that list was out in the open and easy to see.
* What do people want to see in a pif? I've browsed the top posts, and I've seen what I thought were interesting competitions, but it doesn't really give a firm clue as to what the community wants.
* In a similar vein, what about a top list of games that are played forward? I can see that there has been a deluge of Portal, Cogs, Bastion and Fortix, but what else are people tired of seeing?
* There are recent completed pifs with less than 5 upvotes. What's up with that?
* Did the flair used to have a black border around it, or am I imagining things?

Your job will be to help check the spreadsheet and then assign the flair for each user. You'll need to check to make sure that they meet both the
karma and age requirement and that they haven't exceeded the .8 ratio. You'll also be checking for new accounts or people using alternate accounts. 
It would also be nice to see you in the PIF steam chat but it's not really required.

Ok so I bought AC:R and I thought I could register it on Steam, but you can't. So I called Ubisoft support and they conformer that my code for AC:R is valid and working. So you may have to register it on Ubisofts sites or Uplay. 

So I think the best thing to do is download the game via torrent and then if you win install it normal (no crack) and enter the code that way. They said that should work, but they meant install from the disc but same thing. I'm sorry it's complicated but it's Steams fault. I will send you the key a long with pic of the code.

Want one?  This one will be much easier than the last one I ran.

I'll tell you a secret... I have a special love of Fable 3.  I know... It was a horribly short game, and in comparison to 1 and 2, pretty terrible.  But I found it quite enjoyable, if for only one reason: Reaver.  I love Reaver so much that I convinced my fiance to dress up in his outfit for our steampunk style wedding (I didn't tell him why, of course &lt;3).

Here's how to win a copy of Bioshock 2: All you have to do is post the name of your favorite underrated video game character, and why you like them so much.  Now, I don't mean post why you love Sephiroth or why Mai is totally hot because of her big boobs.  I'm talking secondary characters who really got a lot less screen time than they deserved.  Maybe even someone who is so horribly hated by the gaming community, but you just adore (and if you say Cait Sith, I will try not to puke).

Recently, someone brought in to work an old strategy guide for Final Fantasy VII, which just so happens to be one of my all time favorite games. Any Final Fantasy fans out there like to share some of their best experiences with the series? If you're not an FF fan, what games do you get nostalgic about?

I'll also be giving away 3 Steam Trading Card Beta access passes, so please let me know if you're interested in that as well. I'll just be picking people at random, unless I just happen to really like your story.

1365527112.0,26,self.playitforward,1c002p,[PSA] Reminder to read the PIF rules before entering/giving away,30,4,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/playitforward/comments/1c002p/psa_reminder_to_read_the_pif_rules_before/,"In particular Rules 1 and 2 on the sidebar. 

&gt;1. Once you receive 3 more games than you given, you won't be able to enter anymore until your ratio is 1 or higher.
&gt;
&gt;2. If you receive a game on PiF, it is **absolutely forbidden to trade or sell it**. Violation of the rule results in a permanent ban.

I'm not always playing it forward but I visit this subreddit everyday to read through the submissions and the comments so I have a sense of what the subreddit is like. 

I just wanted to remind people that this sub is not about getting free games. It is about people sharing games that they love with other people who are willing to share back. 

This is not a place to come and ask for free games or to keep taking free games without giving back to the community. 

If you are interested in just getting free games without the sharing portion please visit /r/randomactsofgaming or /r/giftofgames. In this subreddit it is expected that once you receive a game you will eventually gift that game or another game of your choice to someone else to keep the good times going. 

Lastly, only ask for a game and accept it you plan on playing it. If you win and realize you no longer want the game it's ok to turn it down so someone else who really wants to play it can get a chance. I bring up this last part up because someone who I recently gave a game too has had that game for a little over a month but has yet to actually play it (but has sunk hours into other games like Tf2) and it sucks to see a good game to waste.

I just had a really shitty week. My redditor of an ex gf dumped me today as an early birthday gift, so I'm writing this from a throwaway account so she doesn't know I'm doing this. I've been trying not to dry heave all day from the anxiety and stress from school, up coming tests, and now this whole ex gf deal. 

So to stop myself from further sinking into anger and self pity, to compensate people for listening to me while I got how crappy I feel off my chest, and to celebrate my birthday in the best way possible, I'm giving away a copy of Penny Arcade's On the Rain Slick Precipice of Darkness 3 to a lucky PiFer. It'll be delivered as a Steam gift.

The usual PiF rules apply. My only condition for this PiF is that you go hug some one you love. Your partner, your parents, your sibling, your friend, your cat, your dog. I don't care who, just hug them. I will close this giveaway on my birthday, Sunday July 8th and choose some one randomly via random.org. If I pass out early on Sunday, then I will draw a winner on the Monday instead.

Mods: I will provide proof of my real Reddit account if required for the PiF.

Edit: I had a derp moment. Please remember to post your Steam ID so I can send you the game.

Second Edit: I just wanted to say thank you. The outpouring of support has almost brought me to tears a few times. Which is saying a lot since I haven't even shed one yet through out this whole ordeal and I'm usually a cry my eyes out in private sort of guy (not ashamed to admit I cry though!). Hopefully I have some extra cash next pay check because I'm definitely putting up another game here to to say thank you to a kick ass subreddit community.

Final Edit: Thank you so much to everyone, I'm slowly starting to work through things and I wanted to say thank you once again for everyone's support. Was wonderful to hear some peoples stories that came to be due to my simple request for people to hug their loved ones. Congrats to DizzyEevee for winning the PiF.

Time to spread the love.

Bastion was my favourite game of 2011 for a variety of reasons. The art direction is absolutely fantastic, the story is amazing, but the one aspect that really got me about the game was the music. I still listen to the soundtrack almost daily and even play it at the store I work at.

So, to you out there whom may be interested in playing this game, what I want to hear from you is about your experiences in gaming with music. It can be about your favourite soundtracks in games, moments with audio design, or simply listening to 80s metal when you were playing Halo 2.

The winner will simply be the submission that I like the best. Seeing as how it's a completely subjective topic I don't really know how else to judge it. Also I'd prefer the winner to be someone who has yet to play the game.

~~Steam says the sale price is only available for the next 5 hours and 40 minutes (at the time of post). I'll keep checking for posts and decide the winner before the sale is over.~~

It's been purchased and in my inventory, no rush any more. Thanks TheSquidFromSpace!

As it kind-of says in the sidebar, Humble Indie Bundles are not valid PiF games. The sidebar actually says they're not allowed, but since we've moved to a badge reward system, I think we could reconsider the rule to them being just ineligible for badges.

Besides this one change, the following guideline still applies to this subreddit and with everything we do here: We Play it Forward first and foremostly to promote indie games and support developers. Free games are great too, but keep this in mind when posting Bundle PiFs.

Here are some guidelines that I think will help:

1. Post the price you paid for the bundle, with some proof if you can. Giving away 10 bundles at the price of 5 cents each is *not* helpful to developers. Pay what you think is a fair price. I think the community will be pretty good about keeping people honorable about this.

2. Don't give your spare Steam keys (or keys for other distro services) away. This is essentially piracy, but the line is blurry. Either way, a dick move to developers.

These have been festering away in my account far too long. All great games.

Amnesia &amp; BIT.TRIP BEAT are SteamPlay titles, and Cogs should be a SteamPlay title soon according to a twitter conversation I had with the dev. This might not matter to most but I thought there might be some OS X users like me lurking this subreddit looking for titles that they can run.

I have only two requests. It would be nice if it actually got played instead of sitting on an ""I'll play it eventually"" pile, and that you guys determine how I give it out. I can't think of a fair way. Not a fan of the random number draw or a random pick in general.

Just tell me why you want it &amp; why you can't get it for yourself. First one with a plausible enough story for each title gets it.

Unless you guys have a better idea, in which case I'm all ears.

EDIT - Cogs is gone, pending pickup.

For the record, I don't want to give these away to new/less active accounts. Less than 6 months or sub 1k comment karma counts as new/less active. It's nothing against you guys, a number of you fall into that criteria and were very polite. I just don't want to get burned (I gave away a copy of Radium for OS X to someone to a newer user that deleted their account right after).

However if I do this in the future and you are still around, be sure to mention that you posted in this thread and I didn't send you anything. You'll definitely get priority.

EDIT 2 - Amnesia is gone, also pending a final decision.

EDIT 3 - BIT.TRIP BEAT has also been promised. Nothing has actually been successfully gifted yet for the record, I accidentally sent Cogs to the wrong person and I'm working to resolve that first.

EDIT 4 - And Audiosurf has been promised. Nothing has been successfully delivered yet for the record, giving me the Vault Boy logo was a tad premature, although I do appreciate it.

I never play this game anymore as it just wasn't my thing and I don't see myself playing it again so might as well get some use out of it and give her away to someone who will actually give her some quality time.

Despite ME not having 300 karma yet I'm giving away to this subreddit and it's kind folk even though I don't even meet the minimum requirements for just entering a contest on this subreddit. I will be following the rules, however and looking for people with 300+ karma and accounts older than 2 months. (Seriously, you guys should bring down the karma requirement to 200 or 250 it scares a lot of people away ---including me almost---)

No real rules beyond the subreddit ones and as far as a contest how about you all just let me know how much time you can put forward to this MMO and what you plan on doing in it. Whoever gives the best response, in my opinion, wins the account.

The account has been inactive since March but I still have free game time offers from BioWare in my email I can forward or give to you through here in order to not have to pay the monthly fee for the first 7 days.

Bonus! The account is also a pre-order account and so comes with the official pre-order items. The account also has two level 20+ characters, both Empire side (Mercenary/Juggernaut). Feel free to comment or message me any questions or concerns and good luck!

So I have been re-playing evil genius latly because I bought it on the steam sale and I lost the CD when the game first came out. I have been having a lot of fun with it. I think its an excellent little game. I would like to play it forward to a good home.

The standard rules apply, post your steam account when you reply so I can look at your profile and add you as a friend to gift it to you.

Another condition, you must play it within the first week of recieving it, I really want to give this to a good home. I dont want to give it to someone looking to increase their library list.

Tell me that you have interest in the game, why you think you should receive it. Maybe tell me a story of something evil that happened to you or something evil you have done.

1320206895.0,22,self.playitforward,lxbqi,[Announcement] Do you think you have what it takes to be a mod? Then apply here!,24,2,46,http://www.reddit.com/r/playitforward/comments/lxbqi/announcement_do_you_think_you_have_what_it_takes/,"Thanks to the new PiF system I have implemented, the number of PiFs have skyrocketed and with the holiday steam sales upon us, we hope it continues to rise. So to handle the demand and award the points faster, we need help.

Warning: Moderating this subreddit is no easy task. It takes hours, a lot of hours and hard work making sure this subreddit runs smoothly. We average around 20 pifs completed every 24 hours. That could be 20 games or 50, so it takes a bit of work. You also will need to be active throughout the day. 

This is not like other subreddits where moderators basically just handle spam. If you aren't prepared to spend 15 hours or so a week on the subreddit, this isn't the job for you.

Expectations: 

* Be active daily as much as possible. 
* Check reported links and the spam queue once an hour when active.
* Respond to mod messages promptly, we like to keep the response times less than an hour, ideally within 15 minutes.
* Edit the spreadsheet following the template, style and guidelines already set forth in the sheet in a timely manner.
* Edit pif points according the rules provided in the sidebar.
* Enter threads and check for scammers, multiple accounts, etc. We caught the recent scammers by being active on the subreddit and monitoring PiFs.
* Need a google account and uses google talk.
* Google Docs and spreadsheet experience. I really don't want to train someone on how to use the spreadsheet. You will need to know how to make pretty hyperlinks like in the sheet. It's not hard but it takes some time to get used to it.
* If you become inactive for long periods of time, we will expect you to resign from the position. The same goes if you don't follow the expectations.

What we are looking for:

* Active Redditors older than 6 months.
* Redditors that completely understand the rules and guidelines of the subreddit. Those who believe in what this subreddit is about.
* Redditors that will mod the subreddit, not someone who just wants to say they are a mod. 
* We are looking for an early morning East Coast, USA redditor that can handle tasks in the morning when I am still sleeping.
* We also need European redditors who can mod the subreddit when I go to bed.

gmduncanidaho and myself have appointed a new moderator earlier today: Ali-Sama. 
He has been an active member of the subreddit for a while and happy to have him apart of the team.

We are looking for about 3 moderators. So think about the expectations and make sure you have free time.

Edit: Continue to apply, we will gather applicants and at a later time go through and decide who goes onto the next step.

Also to clarify, I didn't mean 15 hours of just being on reddit, I mean there currently is about 15 hours worth of work editing spreadsheet, flair, messages, research, etc each week. That figure might go up or down depending on mod availability and other circumstances.

24 hours for this one.

Post steam ID and say what game you want, one per person.

Tell me about the first game that made you stay up all night.  The one you couldn't stop playing no matter what was happening the next day.  Say why they game grabbed you like no other game had before.  I want some freaking nostalgia. Your nostalgia is not required to be as old as mine :D

Here is mine:

Ultima 7 - 1995.  My god, you could kill anyone you wanted, you could steal everything, if you slept too long your back would ache.  It was the most emersive gaming experience of my 15 year old life.  Loved the part of the game was when I discovered you could kill the banker get the key and rob the bank and she came back the next day!  And the flying carpet! I found it without the internet!  I stayed up until I couldn't keep my eyes open another second and woke up the next morning and got going again.  Took me 7 full days, morning to night to beat that game.

**EDIT:**
Awsome stories guys! I really enjoyed reading about your gaming nostalgia.
Seriously I wish I could Pif to all of you.

With the summer sale [almost certainly starting tomorrow](http://i.imgur.com/UM7RXpQ.png) and me in a rare position of being able to get more games than I can probably play I would like to do a PiF.

**How to enter:**

1. Post the name of a single game you want which can be purchased on Steam that you think will be on special sale.*

2. Do not edit your post after creating it. If your post has been edited after the sales are announced it will void your entry.


**How to win:**

1. Tomorrow, after 24 hours have passed and the special sale has rolled over, I'll check Steam. Any that are on special sale* at that point I will pick up and gift to those who have chosen it, up to 30 dollars worth of winners.

If no one should pick a ""winning"" game or if Steam should change the way they do sales and there's no special sales deals this year I will choose winners at random, up to 30 dollars worth.

* **Special sale** - Pretty much everything is guaranteed to be on some sort of ""sale,"" 10% off or what have you. When I say Special Sale I mean the short, few hour spotlight sales with bigger discounts. 

I know it's kind of a complicated way to do this but doing it this way gets us more bang for the buck, letting me give away games to more people. And it makes it a fun guessing game to see if you can guess what games will be on sale at the time. And fuck, it's not as boring as just dispensing stuff, right?

My one issue is that there's no ""gift option"" when purchasing it, so this is only open to those who I deem trustworthy (because I don't know which of my details will be given to you in the email). But hey, I give games away to strangers on the net, so unless you're obviously scum of the earth, you'll qualify.

Winners have been added on Steam:

- /u/tinymonkeyt -  Toki Tori
- /u/somkun - Borderland 2
- /u/Reida8_troll1000 - Sanctum

Sorry to those who didn't win, thank you for the great read. Had a tough time deciding, but I love the fact that somkun obviously started playing the last PiF s/he won almost as soon as he got it, and had PiFed the game back to someone else afterwards. I personally feel that fits the spirit of the subreddit most.

I haven't played them yet so no spoilers please! I'm excited to though! :D

How do you win?

I've HEARD that bioshock has a great ending (don't tell me!). With this in mind, post an alternate ending for any video game.

Your alternate ending should NOT spoil the original in any way! So, for example, if I were writing an alternate ending for The Lord of The Rings, I wouldn't write ""Frodo doesn't destroy the ring, Middle Earth ends"", because that kind of gives away that Frodo does, in fact, destroy the ring. Likewise, I wouldn't write ""Pretty much the same except Character X survives"" because that gives away that Character X doesn't actually survive. I might instead write ""Sauron realizes that he is a sassy gay homo, and that all of the killing and death resulted from his parents' failure to accept him. He and Saruman marry and live happily ever after, using the One Ring of power as a wedding ring.""

Have at it!

**CONTEST IS CLOSED**

We actually had a winner for the lesser of the guess-the-number prizes tonight. **antrino** will get his pick of Bit.Trip Beat or Cogs. Incidentally, the number was determined randomly -- I didn't pick 13!

So we had nine entrants, and that means one of you has to go! This was also randomly determined; sorry, antrino, but you won this drawing as well. We won't be seeing good ol' Stonewall Jackson in this battle.

That business aside, **here's the ladder:**

* Alexander the Great
* Abraham Lincoln

-

* Sun Tzu
* Steve Jobs

+

* Wyatt Earp
* Genghis Khan

-

* Jeanne d'Arc
* Simo Hayha (sorry, but I'm dropping the special characters for my own impatience)

I'll finish all three rounds tomorrow and will announce a winner by July 28th 11PM CST.

---

Contest flavor aside, let's boil this down. To enter this contest, you'll need to comment with:

* **A number between 1-1000**. This enters you for the mystery prize, and may affect whether you make it into the tournament.
* **An historical figure. Any historical figure.** This determines who wins, kind of. It's also the fun part. Good luck!
* **Your Steam profile**. Not your name, but a *link* to your actual profile.

The prizes include:

* **Champion**: Your choice of the [Wolf Pack](http://store.steampowered.com/sub/418/) (worth three points) or [Mafia (1)](http://store.steampowered.com/app/40990/).
* **Runner-Up**: Whichever of the two above games was not chosen.
* **Guess the magic number!**: Win the secret prize: your pick of my Steam Inventory. What's inside? *IT'S A MYSTERY*. This number will also be used in other ways.
* **Your guessed number counts twice!** I've created a second secret number for this PiF only. If you guess *this one*, you'll get your choice of Bit.Trip Beat or Cogs!

Also, please meet the basic PiF guidelines: don't have orange flair, have enough combined karma and an old enough account. Don't be on the banlist. And don't enter if you don't meet these requirements.

This contest will close tomorrow, July 27^th , at 9:00PM CST, when this post is 24 hours old.

---

So just like last time, this is going to appear random, and may be. But the premise is simple. Everyone pitches an historical figure. Last character standing wins. The user who guesses the champion will receive their choice of **the [Wolf Pack](http://store.steampowered.com/sub/418/) (worth three points)** or **[Mafia (1)](http://store.steampowered.com/app/40990/)**. As a consolation prize, the runner-up will receive whichever game is left.

Entries that don't make it into the tournament for whatever reason (probably something to do with fair ladders requiring 2^n participants) will still be given a chance at a **GRAND FABULOUS PRIZE** simply by guessing a number.

I'll randomly choose sixteen (probably) entries, who will square off 1v1, tournament-style, in a variety of exotic locales and dangerous scenarios! I'll determine who fights whom, unless there's a popular request. After the ladder's drawn up, these characters will face off regardless of allegiance or chronology. Then, I'll determine the winner via presumably arbitrary means. Know this: each fight will be at least somewhat fair.

After that, it's basic tournament rules. The winner progresses up the ladder, battling other winners, until there are only two. This final battle will receive a bit more detail, but I'll describe each fight at least a little. If you'd like to contest the results of a given battle, I welcome you to submit a complaint to someone who cares.

To enter, you have to qualify (i.e. no orange flair), post your Steam ID (a link is preferable) and give me a good idea for a game that combines two elements from other games/genres.

I wasn't aware that I would also be getting a spare torchlight. So for the last couple of weeks I have been gifted or traded by very generous people and instead of taking it to like steamgifts.com or trying to trade it for something else, I have decided to PIF this. 

The set rule for this PIF is: Someone who hasn't won a thing from a redditor in the last three weeks. That's it. I want it to go to someone that hasn't had as great as luck as most people. I'll actually now limit this to people that have just been down on their luck lately. 

Thanks guys.

Naturally it goes to Fierycactus, I mean the guys playing on a Mac. I was looking at reddit post histories just to see how much stuff was being entered, what was won, what was lost. I tried to pick a variety of those that maybe did a lot and didn't win to those that might have just done one or two and didn't win. Helltrooper might have gotten it, but apparently he doesn't have a computer for it yet. Sure Torchlight can probably run on anything but I'd like to give it to someone that can enjoy it right now.

Here's what we're going to do: I hate doing random number generation, so I'm going to try something a little different this time.  I'm an Industrial Design major, so I really, really, really like consumer products.  Make a post about your favorite product *that you own*.  Please include a picture (ones from Google are acceptable) and a brief description about why it's your favorite.  The person that I think makes the best case for their choice will be declared the winner.

Here are some ground rules:

1. The product has to be tangible.
2. The product has to be inedible.
3. The product cannot be a sex toy or sex-related.  I really don't want to read a bunch of smart-ass answers about dildos and fleshlights and how they make you feel good. (I know, I'm a fun-killer.)
4.  Focus on the form of the product.  I'm trying to get an idea of how the product's aesthetic affects your perception of it, and how it makes you feel as an owner of the product.
5. Be critical and observant.  Saying you like something because it looks cool is a bad answer because it tells me nothing.

So those are the rules.  I'll leave it open 5:00 PM EST on Sunday, at which point I will determine and announce the winner, provide a brief summary of why I chose them, and then I will contact them via PM and give them their game.

* Acceptance of the fact that my split was 100% EFF
* A promise to count yourself only towards Linux statistics if they ask you (I figure where the money came from matters more than who receives the games in this stat)

Hi all, I bought a nice pack before Christmas that included each of these games. I have enjoyed each of them - and received extra copies today on Amazon - so I'm giving them away to 5 different winners.
All you have to do is list the 5 titles (or just the ones you like) and place a number between 1 and 200 next to the title.
I will do 5 seperate draws for each title using a random number generator, winner 1 will be excluded from draw 2-5, then winner 2 and so on. *Usual background check will apply (2 months + karma)*
Please also include your Steam ID!

Your entry should be something like this:

* Homefront - 12
* Metro 2033 - 197
* RF: Armagedon - 74

Steam ID:

~~I'll do the draw on Wednesday night at Midnight GMT, so plenty of time to get your entries in! Good luck all!~~

I will now do the draw at Midday GMT on Thursday. This will give time for some users to adjust their entries if they wish to enter for the new games.

**How to enter:**

Make a post with this information in it:

* Which game you would like
* A brief reason for why you would like this game
* A link to your Steam profile
* A number between and including 1 and 100

**Rules for valid entries:**

* You may only enter this PiF **once**
* You may choose any one game from the list, but only one game (i.e. you cannot ask for Half-Life *and* Torchlight)
* Your reddit account must have been registered for **at least** 2 months and/or have 300 combined link/comment karma (as per the rules in the sidebar)
* Your Steam account must be active, at least 4 months old, and at least 3 games outside of games in Humble Bundles and other similar bundles.
* Any entry failing to meet these requirements will not be considered in the drawing.

**Notes about the giveaway:**

* The drawings will be done in **1 day** (at 7 PM EST, July 15th)
* I do not believe being partial to any one person is ethical in giveaways, therefore your ""one good reason"" will only be factored into your chance to win in that I will read it to make sure you at least put some thought into why you want it rather than just blindly entering and hoping for free vidya.
* The winning number will be drawn using random.org. If no one guesses the exact number, the closest number will be the winning number.
* If there are two ""closest numbers"" on either side of the winning number (e.g. the winning number is 90 and two people guessed 88 and 92), then I will round **UP** and that number will win (using the previous example, 88 would win).
* If more than one person guesses the correct number, I will arbitrarily assign an equal portion of the number line to each valid entry (e.g. entry 1 gets numbers 1-50, entry 2 gets numbers 51-100), then use random.org to draw another number.  Whoever's portion of the timeline that number falls inside will be the winner.
* I will PM the winner letting them know they have won, then add them to Steam so that I can complete the transaction.  For future reference, here is my [Steam profile](http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197987455698).

Intense stealth action game play with a startling real-time lighting system and surreal visuals combine to produce an incredible gaming experience. Through third person game play, sneak up on enemies and pull the pins from their belted grenades. Infiltrate a Gestapo prison and slip cyanide to your own men before the Germans make them talk. And slink through the shadows to finish off your unsuspecting enemies with a single, silent move. Through Violette's fever dreams, experience what she experienced. Walk where she walked. And kill those she killed.

1339861823.0,24,self.playitforward,v53mx,[PIF] Various Indie games in alphabetical order. Today: A &amp; B.,30,6,68,http://www.reddit.com/r/playitforward/comments/v53mx/pif_various_indie_games_in_alphabetical_order/,"Ok. There's two parts to this, the second part only being interesting to some regulars to this reddit. If you're just interested in the games I'm playing forward, skip past the *wall of text* down to the bold word that says **Today's games.**  
  
**Part 1.** I've been lurking here for a *long* time now, and I like your reddit. It's a great idea, there's some great people, and when the occasional drama occurs, there's a happy ending and it often feels like /r/justiceporn. But, I don't think that games are given proper consideration when played forward. There's a lot of games that are piffed(?) because they were free gifts, heavily discounted, or just popular. Don't misunderstand me - I love that fact that you're giving away games here, sharing the love instead of trying to turn a profit - as I see so often in /r/steamgameswap.   

For me, I'd like to share the indie love - to play forward games that interest people, in some sort of arbitrary order. *So here's what I'm doing...*  
I will go through the alphabet, a bit at a time, naming certain games, and listing what I like/ is interesting about them.  But, I don't know every game, and if you can tell me about an indie game that you like - I just may add it to the list of games I'm playing forward. This will mainly be a steam/gog/desura thing.  

**Part 2.** Does your name start with today's letters, and you have a very positive ratio? Congrats. You *will* receive free games from me - as a thank you for you service to the community. And it *won't cost you any pif points* - because there will only be a few eligible people each time (which makes it too narrow for points to be assigned, I think.) Reply to my relevant comment below, so we can have a conversation and I can find out what games/genres you're interested in.  


**Today's Games.** A &amp; B. This list isn't complete, and if you want to suggest something else, make a comment, and tell me why the game is interesting. I'll only give each game out if 3 or more people want it. **You can request up to three games,** and I only say that because I hate it when someone says ""I'll take all the left overs"". There are no left-overs. With the exception of APOX, I haven't bought any of these yet. Leave your steam ID in your comment, too.

[**APOX**](http://store.steampowered.com/app/80000/). A RTS where the units can act intelligently according to the situation. They can swap active weapons, take cover and share ammo. It didn't do too well, and honestly, you may not have much fun with it. But this game takes a step in the right direction into giving versatility to the units. I think they succeeded in that.  

[**Avernum Great Trials trilogy**](http://store.steampowered.com/sub/14583/) Spiderweb software continue to make isometric squad-based RPGs. That's their niche market. It's nice to see someone continue to make a genre of game that most companies have discrard or revamped so much that they're barely recognizable as such. With each game released they continue to improve their game engine - and that is where the controversy lies. Jeff Vogel's detractors say that he just makes the same game over and over. And that is why I'm playing forward the trilogy - so you can see for yourself and make up your own mind.  

[**Atom Zombie Smasher**](http://store.steampowered.com/app/55040/) It is like a tower defense without the skinner boxing. Your mission is to rescue as many civilians from an area of city that has a zombie outbreak. All the units on the ground are tiny pinpricks of light, and I simply adore the guided brownian motion that occurs, as the zombies meander towards the civilians, and the civilians generally move towards the pick-up point. As a general rule, I'd prefer not to give out games from the humble indie bundles, but it's been a long time since HiB3. 

[**Beat Hazard**](http://store.steampowered.com/app/49600/) It's a combination of bullet hell, asteroids and rhythm game. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone with epilepsy, because there are a LOT of bright flashing lights to distract the player. What compels me to play forward this game instead of other games which use your own music is the variety of features. Local co-op/versus, a mode where you play an album (which is how some music is MEANT to be heard), supports a lot of file types, &amp; a levelling system which is fairly quick to get through - meaning that it isn't a ""Level-up to win"" game (and oh, how I despise those games).  

[**Analogue: A Hate Story**](http://store.steampowered.com/app/209370/) I'll let Alec Meer of Rockpapershotgun.com [tell you about it instead of me](http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2012/02/29/wot-i-think-analogue-a-hate-story/).  

[**Bob came in pieces**](http://store.steampowered.com/app/46000/) A puzzle game (I like puzzle games, you'll come to notice) where you collect various ship parts to connect &amp; rearrange them on your ship to solve physics puzzles and navigate your ship in this 2D world. I haven't finished it, but so far there hasn't been one set way to solve a puzzle, where you needed to know what to do from the start of the level. Thus, the game encourages thinking and experimentaion, which is very interesting.  

[**Binding of Isaac**](http://store.steampowered.com/app/113200/)  As recommended [in this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/playitforward/comments/v53mx/pif_various_indie_games_in_alphabetical_order/c51qg1k). I may give out the dlc if someone wants that instead.

**BIT.TRIP.BEAT** As recommended [in this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/playitforward/comments/v53mx/pif_various_indie_games_in_alphabetical_order/c51p51j)  

**Games I'm not playing forward**  
Braid, Amnesia, and Bastion were just in Humble Bundle V. Likewise, Auditorium is in the current royale bundle, and The Ball, AaaaaAAaaaAAA... and audiosurf were in last week's potato sack. I'm not here to give away games that are extremely cheap at the moment. Go to /r/steamgameswap or similar if you're interested.  
A Valley without wind will be given out when the letter is V, not A. Similar situation  for any game beginning with The when we get to the letter T.

**THIS** PiF will have two winners. Everyone post why they want a card, should win, whatever. Bonus points for a GW profile (j/k). Everyone also pick a pony, so to speak. Tell me why you think person x y or z should win. 

Who ever sells a stranger the best, you get a WoW card. Good luck getting those two months of your life back.

Who ever is the pony picked, you get a SW card - but you also have to pick the next winner for me. 

I will check everyone's profile, ratio, blood type, W/E. Be real, because I would really like this to be cool. Sometimes, the PiF's are for the givers, so if you scam I'll find someone to call you some pretty bad names. 

**Edit**: Winner Winner Chicken Dinner, MoFo's!!!

JTGtoniteonly will be receiving a WoW card *and* a small fraction of his soul is gone permanently. 

ThisRandomRedditor will be receiving a SW card *and* the responsibility of choosing the next contest winner.

*Note* : All winners subject to verification via standard PiF methods, and perhaps whatever some tea leaves can tell me. I will deliver the codes tonight and start round II.

Server transfers are FREE on Rift, you char must be over level 15 but you can do infinite transfers (1week cooldown) free of charge (something other MMO should take exemple of), so feel free to come on my server and I'll help you out :D You can then freely transfer once you're good enough , since it's a french server you'll have some troubles if you don't speak that language =]

So if you'd like to play this pretty nice MMO and you liked the trial , just post a message here :] I'll just give the key once I see a comment that's good enough for me

Hope to see you soon on the lands of Telara !

Alrighty, chaps. I have 2 amazing games for you here. I was originally planning to give the Oblivion GOTY Deluxe as well, but then I found out my computer could actually handle Oblivion, so I'm keeping the Deluxe for myself (stupid computer y u no run Skyrim). 

So some rules:

1. Be at least 3 months old **OR** have PiF'd at least 1 game. No zombie accounts or highly negative PiF ratios. If you feel your ratio does not represent you, indicate why and I may allow an exception.
2. Make a post saying which game you want, as well as why you want it. Include your Steam profile. You cannot win if you do not do these.
3. Optional: recommend me a good game. If you recommend a game that I really like and end up buying, you automatically win. If for some reason more than 2 people recommend me games I like, I'll go buy a couple more copies of Terraria and/or Oblivion. To help you out in this aspect, you can check my steam account for ideas of what games I like: http://steamcommunity.com/id/sorites Also, I like games with a strong single player. Not a big fan of shooters or puzzle games where you match orbs/blocks. I'm more of an rpg/strategy kind of guy. And finally, the game you recommend should be under $20. Don't say Dungeon Defenders, cuz that's already on my to buy list.
4. If you are from the private invite-only Steamgifts PiF group, make note of that in your entry. I will take that into account, since these were the two games I promised to PiF to the group when I joined. I really like reading things people have to say on here though and the largely impersonal nature of Steamgifts kinda turns me off. 

I'll pick a winner sometime on Thursday, probably noon PST.  That's just an estimate though. If the entries grind to a complete halt by Wednesday night, I might just pick then. The winner is not going to be picked randomly. I'll be looking at a variety of things to manually pick.

Shadow of Chernobyl became my favorite game in early 2008 when a friend gave me a copy. While buggy, it has some great scares, an excellent atmosphere, and fun gameplay. The STALKER franchise is easily one of my favorites, bar none. Mods add tons of hours of new content in addition to cut content and new weapons, items, and mutants.

The STALKER pack is very cheap on Steam, and I'd like to give some of my favorite games ever made to some people who would be interested!

All I ask is that the recipient play Shadow of Chernobyl until he or she gets to 100 Rads bar. I think by that point the player will have both learned what the game expects and have gotten over the worst of the learning curve. When I first played it, it did take me some time to get over some bad habits from other FPS games. Persevere! If I made it past the first mission, you can too!

1. To support indie developers.    

2. To play-forward great games other redditors may not have had the chance to play, and for them to hopefully repeat the process (with the same game if they enjoyed it, with a different game if they did not).   
 
  
The great thing about the above two purposes is that they work so well together.

So if redditors who enjoy a particular indie game decide to purchase the game for another redditor, who in turn Plays it Forward, indie game studios and redditors both benefit.   
  
Based on the above information, we have decided to start highlighting posts that meet both of the above two purposes with a star (similar to those seen in the r/AMA subreddit).  These starred posts will have both of the following characteristics:  

+ Someone offering to purchase a game for another redditor or redditors.  

+ The game in question is from an independent developer (or multiple games are offered, at least one from an independent developer).

Posts with the following characteristics are great and we support them, but we won't be explicitly starring them:   

+ Offering to give a game away that you already own.  

+ Offering to give away game/CD keys.    

+ Offering to Play Forward a game by a non-indie developer.  


Posts with the following characteristics will be removed:  

+ Anyone requesting a game.  

+ Anyone encouraging playing games through illegal means, such as torrenting. I know torrenting isn't always unethical, but we are encouraging developer support.   

+ Anyone proposing a game swap or any other sort of quid pro quo.  
  
  
Once you have Played-Forward a game, be sure to edit your post so that everyone knows the game has been given out. And again, please use the spreadsheet (link found in the sidebar) if you Play Forward any games so we can do our best to track activity. In order to help encourage continual Playing-Forward, we'd also like to encourage the gifter(s) to check in with the receiver(s) after a few weeks have passed to see what they thought of the game, and see if they plan on Playing-Forward that or a different game; this can serve as a gentle reminder to keep the chain alive. Finally, as a reminder, we have a subreddit Steam Group  you can join if interested.

I'm going to start a story and leave it with an unfinished sentence.  The next person will quote my portion of the story and continue on, but also leave it in an unfinished sentence.  You can finish my sentence and then start a new one and leave it unfinished, or you can make continue on without finishing it, just make sure you leave it open ended for the next person.

Always quote the portion you're responding to so it links in context, because if enough people participate we should have multiple responses to the same portion, so we might even branch off into different stories!

&gt; ... of Pizza Hut Take out's that was conveniently in his hand and pondered, do they offer...

**Edit #2:**Aaaaaand it's closed! Thank you all for participating! The winner is Artmes! Hope you all had fun and wish you good luck for your next PiF entries!

I'm going to clean up some of the story branches here for everyone to enjoy :) Reading the story as a whole really is kinda wtf in an awesome way...

--------------------------

*Branch 1:*

Ali-sama woke up early this morning, and felt an incredible urge for the human touch. Ali-sama wanted a hug, and he wants it now! He went to the PiF store across the street and asked how much they charge for a hug. The man at the counter said 'I'm sorry, prostitution is illegal, I'm calling the police.' Ali-sama was sent to jail, but on the plus side he met a man called Big Pete, and he got the human touch he always wanted!  After his first encounter with Big Pete, Ali-sama realised he no longer had an urge for human touch, so he asked for his one phone call. Mustering all his courage, Ali-Sama dialed the only person he knew would answer. The familiar click of his beloved cousin! He then asked him to play bowling together but he refused... He always does. Ali-sama suddenly felt depressed and isolated and decided to eat some kabobs. The combination of meaty goodness and mouth watering veggies made his insides warm, and it hit him right in the feels. He remembered the days when Big Pete and he would smuggle kabobs into the prison yard by disguising them as cocaine, which was in turn disguised as cartons of cigarettes. For the sweet meatiness of kabobbery, such convolution and risk was absolutely worth it. And yet he longed for the days of easy access to kabobs, and so resolved to break out of prison by disguising himself as contraband material. Collaborating with his now husband and life-long friend Big Pete, Ali-Sama disguised himself as a kabob (which are strictly contraband in prison, as are many other delicacies, like cocaine, as you well know). The scheme worked as planned, and Ali-Sama was transported to a waste disposal plant outside the prison gates. He rose from the trash heaps, a free man. He wondered to himself; What does freedom smell like? Kabobs, he decided. And trash.  But he knew before he could set out to live a free life, there was one more thing he needed to do...

*Branch 2:*

Ali-sama woke up early this morning, and felt an incredible urge for the human touch. Ali-sama wanted a hug, and he wants it now! He went to the PiF store across the street and it turns out, they were fresh out of hugs! A wandering group of vermicious knids had stolen then last few, and headed towards /r/karmacourt, where they devoured some karma being held as evidence and escaped on The Magic School Bus ...

*Branch 3:*

Ali-sama woke up early this morning, and felt an incredible urge for the human touch. Ali-sama wanted a hug, and he wants it now! He went to the PiF store across the street and realized that he forgot to put his sandals on. 'Hah', he muttered to himself 'How silly of me not to wear my sandals!' He looked down, as if to make sure that they aren't here and then it hit him...",Closed,False,,t5_2s4e5,1358560512.0,closed,,True,t3_16knqf,http://www.reddit.com/r/playitforward/comments/16knqf/pif_ftl_faster_than_light/,

I would like to also let people know that this PIF, and all my PIFs are not a one time only affair, I do these 'events' several times before moving on to my next idea.  Rest assured, unless you are living under a rock, you will NOT miss it! 

------------------

Here is what happens in this PIF:

* Join my [steam group](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/redditgiveaway/)
* Enter chat room **whenever there is an announcement** that indicates the game is starting.  It will be at a random time almost daily to give everyone a chance at participating. (The announcement should pop up in your steam so you will not miss it if you are online and have joined the group)
* Once you are in group chat, everyone will get into teams of three
* Your team members and you will create a jam using [this](http://www.jamwithchrome.com/) website
* After a few minutes of preparation, your jam will be judged by a couple people
* After all jams have been heard, the winning team members will all receive a game
* Rinse and repeat

--------------

What happens after the game?

Prizes distribution, winner list and the answer to most questions can be found in the steam group. Please note that this group follows all PIF rules and I encourage everybody to read the sidebar rules or the almost identical set of rules found on the group [home page].(http://steamcommunity.com/groups/redditgiveaway)

Also as an aside, if ANYONE has copies of 'The Ship' on steam, I would love to trade for them as I have a great plan on using them in my upcoming giveaway (Still don't have enough copies for what I am planning...)

Unfortunately for me, and after a huge embarrassment of only having 4 people watching the stream, not a single person donated a single dollar to the charity I was hosting.  Initially, I had purchased a few games to give away during the stream for the higher donators...

You see where I'm going.

So instead, I'll brighten someone's day.  I have 6 games that I am giving away for the sake of the lack of donations my charity received.

1. Select the game you want and comment here with it.
2. Tell me about a local charity that you have in your area and why should they receive donations.
3. Include your Steam ID.

Standard PiF Rules apply. **You can win only one game.**

The choices on who wins what will be done on Friday, November 16th at 7:00PM Central Time.  Announcements will be made here and games will be sent.

Good luck and happy PiFing.

I'm going to borrow a bit of formatting from a PiF I very much enjoyed. I have 10 games to give away and will post a range of numbers for each game. Here is how you enter:

* Have an account 2 months or older with 300 combined karma.
* You may request 2 games, but can win only 1. Please prioritize which one you prefer (e.g. Choice #1 - Game A, Choice #2 - Game B) and then pick a number from the indicated range next to the game's title.
* If you are selected for both, you will get only 1 game, but hey, at least you got your number 1 pick!

Ready? Here are your choices!

(1-100) [Breath of Death VII](http://store.steampowered.com/app/107300/?snr=1_7_suggest__13) - Zeboyd's first game in their 2D classic RPG revival. It's very funny, super fun, and a relief for we old school RPG players. - No entrants. So this will be put on hold!

(101-200) [Terraria](http://store.steampowered.com/app/105600/?snr=1_7_suggest__13) - Phenomenal game, it's like Minecraft but with 2D action and a lot more killing. - Godde is the winner!

(201-300) [Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee](http://store.steampowered.com/app/15700/?snr=1_7_suggest__13) - Fantastic adventure game with fun mechanics to boot. You'll be saving Abe's friends from slavery, so bring your A game. - PretendPHD is the winner!

(301-400) [Broken Sword: Director's Cut x2](http://store.steampowered.com/app/57640/?snr=1_7_suggest__13) - One of the most incredible adventure games you can play. An engrossing plot, interesting characters and several great sequels. - ArsonJr and mgdmw are the winners!

(401-500) [Zen Bound 2](http://store.steampowered.com/app/61600/) - This game is so bloody relaxing. You wind rope around wooden figurines, with each bit of rope painting the figure. Once it's completely coated, you can move on the next shape. It's oddly mesmerizing and lovely. - ArchaeopteryxAlex is the winner!

(501-600) [The Binding of Isaac X2](http://store.steampowered.com/app/113200/?snr=1_7_suggest__13) - If you haven't heard of this, you must be new to reddit. This thing is magnificent. Rogue-like at it's finest with a lot of great, disturbing designs. - Virileman and Syncronyze are the winners!

(601-700) [Wizorb](http://store.steampowered.com/app/207420/?snr=1_7_suggest__13) - Had a BLAST beating this game! It's like Breakout with some cool little twists and magic to be worked to help out, along with fun boss fights. - oasis789 is the winner!

(701-800) [Booster Trooper x3](http://store.steampowered.com/app/27920/?snr=1_7_suggest__13) - There are 3 copies of this one on the block, so I'll roll three times for this guy! It's a very fun little side-scrolling shooter with good multiplayer. - helltrooper, rofl627 and Earl_of_Lemongrab1 are the winners!

And there we have it!

As a bonus, anybody who explains why they want their choices (which must be done separately) gets their roll bumped up to 3 numbers closer to the winning digit. So if you want an edge on the competition, give me something to read and I'll give you a leg up!

Good luck everyone, and this will complete 6pm PST Saturday, the 14th of July.

Any games not selected/won will be rePiFed in a more conventional manner.

EDIT: Actually, I've decided a little over 24 hours probably isn't long enough. I'll be ending this Sunday evening, 6pm Pacific!

EDIT 2: Due to popular demand, I'm officially adding a **second** copy of The Binding of Isaac to the PiF! There will now be two lucky winners of that bracket. :D

From the website. 

&gt; It’s a co-op survival horror game. Up to 6 players in online co-op mode, or just you, on your own, playing the Solo mode. The aim – cleanse each area of zombies, in waves, until you get to the last one. The Big One. The Patriarch. Then exterminate him, too. Actually, they aren’t “zombies”. They are the left-over “specimens” from a cheap and dirty government program to clone soldier-monsters. The basic ones will just munch on your arm and try to disembowel you. The bigger ones were the first ones they tried arming. Nothing much. Just a chainsaw or a blade for starters. They had just got on to the chain gun and rockets when the government tried to secretly shut down their secret program.

Welcome reddit gamers to my boredom and extra games list.


Welcome to Random &amp; Roulette.


**There are two ways to play (you may choose one):**

**1)** Roll on [random.org](http://www.random.org) a number in the range before the game you most prefer and post your number.

**2)** Roll on [random.org](http://www.random.org) a number in the range of 2801-5600 (Roulette) and post your number.


**The Rules:**

* **You meet the subreddit's Rule #1 (see the sidebar)**
* Your account is in good standing (not on the shared ban list, account is not in a ""cannot win"" status)
* Each user may only post 1 (one) number.
* It is your own duty to make sure you don't post a duplicate (CTRL+F), re-roll if you get a duplicate.
* Each game has been pre-assigned a random 100 number sequence for the roulette range.  In roulette, the number you roll will be normalized to the game's natural range and given a **+3** towards the winning number in the game category your roll ends up in.
* You must have a steam account.  There are no requirements on your steam account.
* Tie (due to a Roulette roller not knowing if they duplicate a roll from a specific game) rolls go to the Rouletter.
* If a roulette winner is unable to take a gift because they already own it (a risk you must consider), you get nothing, and the natural winner for that category will be notified.  (A bit cruel, but that's the game of Roulette)


**Winners will be notified the evening of Friday June 1st (USA evening).**

**If you have given games in this subreddit and never received any:**  
merely post a comment with a link to your steam community page, and mention which bundles you'd like  

**If you have given away games elsewhere on reddit, but not in r/playitforward:**  
Post a comment with a link to your steam community page, mention which bundles you'd like, and a link to the thread where you gave stuff away on reddit.  

**If you have ever received games on reddit**:  
Post a comment with a link to your steam community page, mention which bundles you'd like, and spend less than 250 words (that's a short paragraph) to give us a short review of one of the games you've received.  

**If you've never given or received games on reddit:**  
Post a comment with a link to your steam community page, mention which bundles you'd like, and mention a different indie game which you think should be played forward in this subreddit and what you like about it.

Anyone with an active Reddit account that is at least one month old is eligible. 

In order to join in on this, I want you to submit a cool, awesome, funny, or just random drawing.  This can be done on computer or paper, get creative! Don't worry if you suck at drawing, so do I! I don't know if this even needs to be said, but please only post your original work.

I will be giving away a Steam game worth up $15. The winner gets to choose any game he wants. If the first winner, does not spend up to $15, I will choose another person as a second winner. They can choose a game of their choice. I will probably choose more than one winner, because redditors are awesome people.


Along with your picture, please link your Steam as well as the game you would like. I suggest checking out the daily deals, they're really great. Have fun with this, that's what it's all about. Remember any game, no judgement here :D


Edit: Oh yea, I'll be leaving this up for at least 24 hours, good luck!

**Edit: I am going to open it up for the Humble Bundle as well, if interested.**

These are looking really great, makes me wish I could give out more! At that note, I will give out the first gift shortly. **Alright, the first winner is Farkeman!**

I have had an absolutely fantastic day. like, completely freaking awesome. 
I am in such a good mood right now that I have decided to do another PiF! Woo. 

The game up for grabs, for those of you who just blindly click every link without reading the title is Cave Story+. 

Let me tell you about Cave Story. It is a fantastic game. It is a side scrolling adventure. I'd say it's like metroid, but it kind of isn't. I'd say it's like awesome, and I will. because it is. I stole it once long ago before I Grew up a little and realized that pirating is wrong. And then I made it right by purchasing the DSiware version for my 3DS, and then by buying Cave Story 3D. AND NOW, I am making it even more right by buying a copy to give to somebody who may have considered stealing it, but just hasn't bothered yet. 

So here's the deal. This game goes to the individual guesses the number I'm thinking of right now between 1 and 500. there. I thought the number. I hope your time travelling telepathy is working.  

Good luck! 

*Edit* I will declare the winner when I get home from work tomorrow night at 5:30, PST. 

*Edit Edit* It is 11:16pm my time and I just got home from something that made my day EVEN BETTER. Also, I see that somebody has already guessed the original number. I won't tell you who it is though, but I WILL tell you that I have just chosen two NEW numbers, and if those numbers are guessed, I will gift those people Cave Story+ to them as well. 

*Edit Edit Edit* Oh! Oh! Somebody has guessed the second number! Man, are they going to be happy. 
One more number to go! Possibly! I won't lie, I haven't done a Control+F yet to find the numbers, I've just scrolled by really quick, so maybe number three is gone already as well. but keep trying! 
Keep guessing! 



*FINAL EDIT*
Alright! Woo. Today... was not nearly as great as yesterday. However, I have Ctrl+F'd my three numbers and have found our winners. 

The first number - 21. (the number of days until I get to see my girlfriend for Christmas holidays! Now, in a sick twist of fate, **VenserPW** was the first to guess 21. I did see somebody else guessed, but I had already chosen new numbers. Sorry, second lucky guesser. Maybe next time. 

The Second number was - 51. AND YOU THOUGHT YOU SHOULDN'T ENTER **ERITH_FI**. 

The third, and final lucky number was 88. **Warewulff**, you were going for a reference, but I have a confession.  The second two numbers were actually the last four digits of a phone number I got last night from some chick that liked my swagger. 
Too bad I already have a beautiful girlfriend and am not interested in finding another. Her loss is YOUR GAIN THOUGH. 

Would the three winners kindly fire me your Steam ID's in PMs? I will give you your game as soon as i get your sexy, naughty steam ID's.

here's how it works...i've created a steam account and populated it with one game (Amnesia), i'll select one responder at random and give them the entire account (**not** including the gmail account associated with the steam account). play the game for a bit (one month? two?) then add another game of your choosing to the account and PiF the whole account to someone else.

eventually, the account should have a decent library of games and we can pass them all around

maybe track it in the google doc? i'm a bit leery of that since apparently someone's erased ALL my contributions in the doc :/

edit: addition to the rules. i think it's reasonable to require that you've PiF'd at least one game before you get access to the library.

edit2: **winnar: ichbinpwnzilla**

edit3: need a mod to take over the gmail account, unless y'all want me to hang on to it. i'm fine with going in either direction.

mildly drunken edit4: it's no longer mine, so i can't really dictate rules at this point but it'd be great if future recipients are careful about who they PiF it to. please make sure recipients are active PiFers, at the very least.

Based on [the last PiF I did](http://www.reddit.com/r/playitforward/comments/18m3xg/pif_anodyne_multiple_copies/), these two games are absolutely **perfect** to try a couple new entry rules!

(Oh, if anyone is wondering why this isn't more Anodyne, Humble support replied that ""The purchase limits are part of anti-fraud measures. Unfortunately I am unable to lift the fraud protection, but we are looking into improvements in the future."")

HOW TO ENTER!
--

To enter for GMod, let's see you [build something out of nothing!](http://www.reddit.com/r/playitforward/comments/18m3xg/pif_anodyne_multiple_copies/c8g07rs)  That is to say - use whatever tools you have at your disposal and/or re-purpose something for the sake of entertainment.  The example suggestion from the previous thread was to build a bridge out of coins (but let's not have nothing but coin bridge submissions, Please :).  The more gaming related, the better.

To enter for Deus Ex, let's see some [live action shots of you](http://www.reddit.com/r/playitforward/comments/18m3xg/pif_anodyne_multiple_copies/c8gb262) pretending you're in Adam Jensen's world (a stack of boxes concealing the *obvious you* from a family member or a .gif of you having **to freakin' stand to use a computer.**  grr...).

The more imaginative and/or hilarious, the better.

**To enter for either game**, please make sure your reddit account meets the karma rules for entry, and please leave a link to your Steam profile in your submission.

I'll leave this one open for a few days probably - so no rush to find the perfect scenario.  And yeah, I understand the paradox or whatever of asking you to imitate a game you have yet to play, but these aren't really new any more, and YouTube...

Feel free to shop out your face or whatever from the live action shots if you want, and submitting something you've already done - for either - is acceptable, as long as **it's actually you** who did it.

And how about a shout to the PiF Steam chat?  It's lonely in there.  Come.  Talk.  Strategize.  :P",Closed,False,,t5_2s4e5,1361321321.0,closed,holiday11,True,t3_18ur5b,http://www.reddit.com/r/playitforward/comments/18ur5b/pif_garrys_mod_x2_and_deus_ex_hr/,

I really liked KRZ. The art style is wonderful, reminds me of Another World. The atmosphere is really nice. It's kinda different than all the adventure games you probably played, you make decisions, but it's sometimes really bizarre, you have to play it... 

Please upvote this post for visibility. I'll randomly choose the winner in a few days. To enter, just comment below.

The giveaway will be the link to the DRM free version from humble store that you can play immediately. However it's been greenlit on steam, and will be available soon. The winner can activate their copy once it's available.

Good luck!

The winner is, TheGMan323!

Welcome reddit gamers to my boredom and extra games list.


Welcome to Random &amp; Roulette.


**There are two ways to play (you may choose one):**

**1)** Roll on [random.org](http://www.random.org) a number in the range before the game you most prefer and post your number.

**2)** Roll on [random.org](http://www.random.org) a number in the range of 1001-2000 (Roulette) and post your number.


**The Rules:**

* **You meet the subreddit's Rule #1 (see the sidebar)**
* Your account is in good standing (not on the shared ban list, account is not in a ""cannot win"" status)
* Each user may only post 1 (one) number.
* It is your own duty to make sure you don't post a duplicate (CTRL+F), re-roll if you get a duplicate.
* Each game has been pre-assigned a random 100 number sequence for the roulette range.  In roulette, the number you roll will be normalized to the game's natural range and given a **+3** towards the winning number in the game category your roll ends up in.
* You must have a steam account.  There are no requirements on your steam account.
* Tie (due to a Roulette roller not knowing if they duplicate a roll from a specific game) rolls go to the Rouletter.
* If a roulette winner is unable to take a gift because they already own it (a risk you must consider), you get nothing, and the natural winner for that category will be notified.  (A bit cruel, but that's the game of Roulette)


**Winners will be notified in approximately 48 hours on the evening of Sunday December 9th (USA evening).**


**The Games:**

* [1-100] Post Apocalyptic Mayhem (PAM) [16 - Winner: **PlayerUno**]
* [101-200] F.3.A.R. [106 - Winner: **xhuntercx**]
* [201-300] Nation Red [204 - Winner: **ThePenguinBro**]
* [301-400] Mirror's Edge [377 - Winner: **precursormar**]
* [401-500] Hoard [419 - Winner: **PrototypeT800**]
* [501-600] Trine Franchise (Trine 1+2, warning, counts as 2 points) [557 - Winner: **WilliamAgain**]
* [601-700] Orcs Must Die [671 - Winner: **anoxy**]
* [701-800] Torchlight [718 - Winner: **TheDukeDude**]
* [801-900] Cave Story+ [881 - Winner: **evilphotosynthesis**]
* [901-1000] Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2 [907 - Winner: **WantsToKnowStuff**]


* [1001-2000] Roulette (Random shot at any of the games listed above)

**ROUND FOUR**  
**=========**

**Sniper vs. Adam Jensen!**  
Sniper creeps up the stairs of the air control tower. Whoever's here is even quieter than him. He surveys the deck of the aircraft carrier. Silence and stillness. He sets up his equipment.

//

The sea air isn't great for Adam's arm. It still clicks slightly when he clenches his fist. Infrared scans are scattered by the wind, EM scans by the metal. He turns off the safety on his tranq pistol and proceeds along the starboard catwalk.

//

He removes his glasses and cleans the scope. This old rifle wasn't much to look at, but the notches had turned to grain after all these years. Twenty minutes now. *Whoever this guy is, he's a pro.*

//

Breaking into a jet fighter would be a lot easier in the cockpit, but it's not impossible at a distance. Every trick in the book, Adam uses. The console begins to glow softly. He turns the engine on. The howl of the wind is cut by the high-powered fuel. It slowly starts cruising out onto the runway.

Adam begins to run in the shadows. High ground. For just a second, he sees a point of light inside the control tower.

//

*A distraction,* Sniper realizes. *Only one reason to use one of those.* He leans forward, waiting for the mercenary to make a mistake in his hurry. He squints, waiting for a shot. Even a moment is enough.

//

There's a low grinding as the jet slides off the bow. Adam sprints up the stairs, bracing himself outside the door. It doesn't even creak as it opens. He raises his pistol and fires four darts into the huddled mass. The mess collapses with the clattering of steel and bamboo, revealing a monitor.

""Thanks for standing still,"" it reads.

Adam turns to run, but an angry Australian blocks the doorway, glaring with raised rifle.

*Champion: Sniper! (ArchaeopteryxAlex)*  
*Runner-up: Adam Jensen (ThePancakeMan)*

---

**ROUND THREE**  
**==========**

**Isaac vs. Sniper:**  
Sister Maggy hits the ground with a falsetto whimper. Isaac and Little Steve duck behind a corner. A bullet strikes the blade jutting out of Isaac's torso. He rolls to hide it. He'll need the range. He holds out the Bag of Bombs. Steve looks uncertain. Isaac pushes it towards him, closes the familiar's arms around it.

Steve generally prefers to be on the other end of sending someone to die. He takes the satchel and begins making his way towards the grassy embankment. At dusk, the muzzle flare is too difficult to spot, but he can hear the report of that old rifle.

//

""Bloody hell,"" Sniper says. It's a floating doll with a shitload of bombs. ""Gotta go, mum!"" He hangs up.

The little guy charges up the hillside, hiding behind a chunk of granite. Sniper hears a scraping noise. Is he digging? No. *He's using a flint.* A bomb glimmers in the morning sun before plopping down at his elbow.

Sniper hastily adopts a new line of fire. As he sprints, he hears only his heart pounding, a scrape, and the blast of the first bomb. He reaches into his knapsack and chucks a jarful of ol' Yellow Mountain Springs behind the offending rock. A sizzle. A gasp. Muffled retching. Sniper kicks the strange little doll aside and grabs the moist satchel, flinging it where he saw that bronzed hilt a minute before.

A moment later, Isaac is booking it from behind the rock. Running in a straight line. He doesn't stay that way long. ""Hey mate,"" he says, pulling the curved blade from Isaac's chest. ""Nice knife.""

*Winner: Sniper!*

**James Bond vs. Adam Jensen:**  
""A negotiation, then?""

""You and I both know that's not how this ends.""

James curses under his breath, a dirty word so secret only the Queen's Agents know it. A quick peek around the corner. ""The Swiss. The Koreans. Whoever sent you,"" James says, ""they'll kill you after you finish with me. You need protection.""

//

*He's stalling,* Adam realizes. He can't find this guy's heat signature, but there's some kind of coded signal going out. It's staticky. He tasks his core with decrypting it.

The portal gun lies on the warehouse floor, completely unprotected. He'd dropped it in the scuffle after trying to push the guy through a hole in the wall and out the ceiling. This British guy, he wouldn't go through, he just started glowing green.

Now this standoff, and all Adam has is a short-range tranquilizer gun.

He looks up, through the portal still in the warehouse's high corrugated-steel ceiling. There's no jumping to it, but even so. For lack of anything else to throw, he pulls the clip from his gun and flings it towards the hole.

A perfect shot. It flies sideways through a wall behind Bond. Adam hopes the distraction works as he lunges for the portal gun. A bullet catches him by the shoulder, somehow ripping the entire arm off. He lands on his side, his HUD alight with klaxons and error messages.

""Fuck this,"" Adam says, firing one portal into the floor next to him. He traces the source of the coded transmission and fires another portal into the ceiling directly above it before pushing himself over this newborn ledge. Gravity and his 300-pound tech do all the work.

Adam loads up his specs and starts putting himself back together.

His core pings cheerily; the message has been decoded.

*Winner: Adam Jensen!*

**Final round: Sniper vs. Jensen!*

---

**ROUND TWO**  
**=========**

**Kratos vs. Isaac:**  
Even under the assault of a thousand chocolate milk bubbles, Kratos just can't shake this rictus. His thunderous footfalls shake the Earth, but Isaac is just too dang fast. Finally, an opening -- but his blade shatters inches from its target, and a small housefly whimpers and falls. In his gleeful confusion, Kratos simply doesn't notice that Isaac's cheeks have grown to the size of basketballs. *Winner: Isaac!*

**The Kid vs. Sniper:**  
The Kid's fast, sure, but is he fast enough? Another *whiz*, and he tumbles for cover. All those years on patrol, all those songs he took for granted - The Kid crouches behind a rock and lines up a shot. His aim is true, and the blade ricochets. Kid hears a fleshy grunt, and dares to take a peek. He collapses, draws his last breath. The gunman approaches, replacing his newly-destroyed leathery green shield with the Kid's fancy red one. Kid oughta mind his step next time.

**Tim vs. James Bond:**  
Bond just can't get a shot--just *one* shot--on this kid. Sometimes he moves too fast. Sometimes he slows the bullets. Finally, Bond catches a glimmer. There's a ring on the ground, and time seems to bend around it. Tim gets too close, too cocky (he would later bemoan his own arrogance in a LiveJournal post,) and ventures into the slowness to pick the ring up again. It's too bad - Bond fires at it, and although the bullet slows as it approaches, Tim slows, too. After what seems like an eternity, the bullet kisses the ring and hangs there. Tim doesn't move, either. Bond fixes his tie, and notices he's taken on a slight green glow in the dust-up. Strange. *Winner: James Bond!*

**Chell vs. Adam Jensen:**  
Having no proper weapon to speak of, Chell lures the mercenary into a trap. A seemingly innocent portal changes destination at the last second, and with another *splurt*, changes origin, too. The twenty-mile drop, she thinks. It's the only way for someone who's nearly killed her twice before simply disappearing into the shadow or behind a staircase. She takes cover and waits while he falls. He'll have hit terminal velocity by now, she knows, but just in case that's not enough, better give him a little time to break a bone or two on the portal edges.

She knew he had the armor. She didn't know about the tech. With a little concentration, Adam's mods whip up a prototype from those fancy boots they scanned. She fires a new portal in the ceiling. He lands loudly, but intact, his new feet braced for any impact. He raises his gun. *Winner: Adam Jensen*


The New Ladder:

* Isaac vs. Sniper
* James Bond vs. Adam Jensen

I'll post these last three battles all in a go, so stay tuned for the winners, folks.

---

**ROUND ONE**  
**========**

**Kratos vs. The Joker:**  
The Joker may be an agent of chaos, but Kratos has the *Blades* of Chaos. While his seemingly endless supply of backup plans is useful for getting out of a tight spot, The Joker also tends to rely on Batman's unwillingness to kill. This is not such a useful tactic against the god of war, and Kratos--after chasing the villain through a minefield, abandoned sawmill, and poison cloud--manages to run the bastard through. Maybe it's the victory, but Kratos just can't help but smile. *Winner: Kratos!*

**Isaac vs. Montezuma:**  
Maybe Montezuma is a god, maybe not. Either way, Isaac's taken on worse. While fleeing the crazed ruler's massive army, Isaac stumbles across a slot machine, a can of dog food, and a carton of chocolate milk. Man, Montezuma is *screwed*. Isaac grabs his silvered headdress. *Winner: Isaac!*

**The Kid vs. Samus:**  
The Kid isn't easily surprised, but this gal got him but good. She fires off some kind of explosive, and even The Kid is surprised by his narrow escape. A well-aimed machete puts her on the ground, but The Kid can't help but wonder if she might have been a kindred spirit. Damn shame. *Winner: The Kid!*

**The Sniper vs. Alan Wake:**  
The mirror blinding the sniper was a neat trick, but ultimately ineffective. You can't shine a light where you can't see, and a good sniper always has a backup plan. When Alan's batteries finally died, the hired killer put aside his laser-scope and went old-fashioned: a nice bow and arrow. *Winner: Sniper!*

**Isaac Clarke vs. Tim:**  
He must've died to the plasma cutter at least seven times. Each time, it was undone. Isaac couldn't figure out how he did it. This little boarding school guy kept not dying somehow. It was hard to keep track of. The near misses felt... unreal. Even with the stasis module, it was hard to see what really happened. Isaac was used to being pounced upon, but this one caught him off-guard. Landing directly on his head, Tim cracked the engineer's neck. *Strange these things can sometimes be,* he thought. Then he wrote it down in his journal in elaborate cursive. *Winner: Tim*

**James Bond vs. Alyx Vance:**  
It's uncertain what took place in the bedroom before their inevitable shootout, but Alyx's multi-tool only disabled his invisibility watch... not his golden gun. Bond is no stranger to capable women trying to kill him. *Winner: James Bond*

**The Courier vs. Chell:**  
You ever seen [Portal: No Escape](http://youtu.be/4drucg1A6Xk)? Well, the thing that happens three minutes in? That's what happens. Watch the video all the way through, it's fantastic. *Winner: Chell*

**Gordon Freeman vs. Adam Jensen:**  
The remnants of a shattered crowbar. The echo of an empty chamber. An old orange suit, administering morphine. The man strolls out of the shadows, the glint of reflected bullets in his arm, the glimmer of metal through the holes in his jacket. ""Sorry about that,"" the man says. *Winner: Adam Jensen!*

The notation is weird but it should be apparent with a little logicking what the full ladder looks like. I'll have the results up tomorrow, along with the next giveaway. The theme: history!

Nobody guessed either of the magic numbers! Shoot. Sorry, folks.

---

**CONTEST IS CLOSED**

So I had to knock it down to sixteen participants. My apologies to those who were only entering for fun; I had to boot you to make a nice even tournament.

Our 16 entrants are (in no particular order):

* Isaac Clarke
* The Sniper
* Chell
* Gordon Freeman
* Samus
* Tim
* The Kid
* The Joker
* Alex Vance
* Adam Jensen
* Isaac
* The Courier
* Kratos
* James Bond
* Montezuma
* Alan Wake

I'll get back to you folks in a bit with the pairings later tonight, and the results tomorrow. Good luck!

*note:* Nobody guessed either of the mystery numbers! Try again for the mystery prize in my next PiF! I'll keep using that same number until someone guesses it.

---

Flavor aside, let's boil this down. To enter this contest, you'll need to comment with:

* **A number between 1-1000**. This enters you for the mystery prize, and may affect whether you make it into the tournament.
* **A video game character. Any character**. This determines who wins, kind of. It's also the fun part. Good luck!
* **Your Steam profile**. Not your name, but a *link* to your actual profile.

The prizes include:

* **Champion**: Your choice of [Dungeon Defenders](http://store.steampowered.com/app/65800/) or [The Misadventures of P.B. Winterbottom](http://store.steampowered.com/app/40930/).
* **Runner-Up**: Whichever of the two above games was not chosen.
* **Guess the magic number!**: Win the secret prize: your pick of my Steam Inventory. What's inside? *IT'S A MYSTERY*.
* **Your guessed number counts twice!** I've created a second secret number for this PiF only. If you guess *this one*, you'll get your choice of the five Dungeon Defenders DLC I've got lying around. This is *zero points!*

Also, please meet the basic PiF guidelines: don't have orange flair, have enough combined karma and an old enough account. Don't be on the banlist. And don't enter if you don't meet these requirements.

This contest will close tomorrow, July 25^th , at 9:00PM CST, when this post is 24 hours old.

---

So just like last time, this is going to appear random, and may be. But the premise is simple. Everyone pitches a video game character. Last character standing wins. The user who guesses the champion will receive their choice of **[Dungeon Defenders](http://store.steampowered.com/app/65800/)** or **[The Misadventures of P.B. Winterbottom](http://store.steampowered.com/app/40930/)**. As a consolation prize, the runner-up will receive whichever game is left.

Entries that don't make it into the tournament for whatever reason (probably something to do with fair ladders requiring 2^n participants) will still be given a chance at a **GRAND FABULOUS PRIZE** simply by guessing a number.

I'll randomly choose sixteen (probably) entries, who will square off 1v1, tournament-style, in a variety of exotic locales and dangerous scenarios! I'll determine who fights whom, unless there's a popular request. After the ladder's drawn up, these characters will face off regardless of franchise, universe, or loyalty. Then, I'll determine the winner via presumably arbitrary means. Know this: each fight will be at least somewhat fair.

After that, it's basic tournament rules. The winner progresses up the ladder, battling other winners, until there are only two. This final battle will receive a bit more detail, but I'll describe each fight at least a little. If you'd like to contest the results of a given battle, I welcome you to submit a complaint to someone who cares.

I also want you to tell me why that particular thing is so great.

The more obscure and awesome it is, the better.  Please refrain from linking to any pirated software sites.  We all know they exist, I'd like to avoid that here.

That's right, it's the roguelike that Nintendo banned from the 3DS eShop due to questionable religious content. From Edmund McMillen (of Team Meat's *Super Meat Boy*,) **The Binding of Isaac** is a top-down arcade shooter that will burn your thumbs into bloody stumps.

&gt; When Isaac’s mother starts hearing the voice of God demanding a sacrifice be made to prove her faith, Isaac escapes into the basement facing droves of deranged enemies, lost brothers and sisters, his fears, and eventually his mother.

&gt; The Binding of Isaac is a randomly generated action RPG shooter with heavy Rogue-like elements. Following Isaac on his journey, players will find bizarre treasures that change Isaac’s form, giving him superhuman abilities and enabling him to fight off droves of mysterious creatures, discover secrets, and fight his way to safety.

You can enter this PiF in a number of ways. **Choose one of the following:**

1. Go contribute to a conversation in [/r/truegaming](http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/new), and leave a comment here linking to your comment.
2.  List three indie games, all from different companies, and all from different genres which haven't been on r/playitforward. It may inspire me to play one forward in the future.
3. [Four. Sentence. Game. Reviews.](http://www.reddit.com/r/4sentencegamereviews) subreddit could do with a bit of love. Go review two games that haven't been done in that subreddit, and provide the links in your comment.  
4. Help someone with their question in [r/ExplainLikeImFive](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/new/),  [r/TipOfMyTongue](http://www.reddit.com/r/tipofmytongue/new/) or a similar subreddit, and link to your comment below.

*Just a few bits of trivia about the game, which may help your decision of whether or not to enter:*  

* There is a split-screen co-op mode, as long as one person uses keyboard + mouse, and the other person uses a controller.
* This is [""one button attack""](http://www.giantbomb.com/one-button-combat/92-1676/) game, where the timing of the offense and defense buttons is especially important.
* It is $30 to buy it.
* Aside from an eventual linux port, it is being made by two people of wolfire games. Wolfire really made their mark when they organized the humble indie bundle. Since then they've split the company into two parts; one side handles the humble bundles, and the other half is making overgrowth.

The game that was my first obsession was the original Jak and Daxter. My parents bought the PS2, our first games console, on tax break money (they wanted a DVD player) and couldn't afford many games or accessories. I must have played the Jak and Daxter demo hundreds of times, and eventually I rented the game over a spring break. Of course, I didn't have a memory card, so I had to leave the console on 24/7, and the rental period wasn't enough to beat the game, but I was hooked.

So there is yet another indie bundle. If you buy it within the next 40 hours you will get zombie shooter 1 and Hacker Evolution: Untold.

[Indie Gala Bundle](http://www.indiegala.com/)

The layout of the website is very similar to The Humble Bundle, and the same rules apply (pay what you want).

The thing that is sketchy about this bundle, is that the keys are sent in plain text in an email, with a link to steam. All you get with this bundle are steam codes, which is a shame in my opinion. Since the emails are sent in plain text, I would assume this is very insecure, there are claims that codes are being already claimed when people try activating their games.


*Whoever wants to give out codes, Please make a top level comment in this post. You may also submit the code in the comment.

*If you use a code, please post a reply so others know it was used.

---
To the MODS: We are going to be flooded with steam codes for these games, since they will be super easy to come by. I would assume the same rules apply with Humble Bundle and Indie Royale, but I will let you decide that.

---

**EDIT:** Please, please, DO NOT PM me with your email address without requesting in the comments below first. A few people have done that, and I bought the bundles for them, but I would feel more comfortable if you left a comment first.

If you leave a comment, and I want to buy you the bundle, I will contact you for your email address

I want somebody who will enjoy it not somebody looking for a freebee. Well yeah you can be looking for a freebee but I want you to at least enjoy the freebee.

Backstory : I often play it forward. I've given away a lot of games in the past because of nice things others have done and my friends have done. I have yet to do one on play it forward so I figured I would now. 

I e-mail Spaz's support and asked if they would be having a sale soon, because I wanted to get the game for two of my friends but I only had enough money for one of them. He ended up giving me a free copy. I made a post in r/gaming about it, it blew up and a lot of people found out about the game/bought it.

So then he gave me FIVE free copies of the game. I'm not cool enough to give away all five copies here on reddit, but one is cool with me. I have a few friends who would want them so sorry I can't be super extra generous. If it helps one more copy is being given away in my clan's contest so there's that.

How to get the key: Do anything, tell me anything, say anything, anything. 

Ideas: Post a video of you playing the spaz demo, post a story about you playing the spaz demo, tell a joke, tell a story, talk about why you want it, talk about yourself, post a funny picture, do something. 

Seriously do anything :). Good luck, I'll choose a winner tomorrow or later today depending on the number of posts.

Edit 3: It seems one of the redditors I picked doesn't actually want the game. If people are still interested, more requests are welcome.

Edit 4: **Last winner has been selected.**

The game doesn't take that long to complete (about 3 hours or so). I enjoyed the game but thought it had some flaws. There were some parts (like the final boss battle) that I felt were too difficult and the game stopped being ""fun"". That's just like my opinion though so who is to say someone else wont enjoy the game more than I did. So in the spirit of PiF I decided to play the same game forward and not change it up.

1. Link to steam profile (public)
2. Tell me why you want Hydrophobia.

[LA Noir](http://store.steampowered.com/app/110800/) is very GTA-esque, as it should be since it is made by Rockstar. But the feel of things is much different. It is set in the 1940's, and you are a detective, like heavy rain. 

&gt;Amid the post-war boom of Hollywood's Golden Age, Cole Phelps is an LAPD detective thrown headfirst into a city drowning in its own success. Corruption is rampant, the drug trade is exploding, and murder rates are at an all-time high. In his fight to climb the ranks and do what's right, Phelps must unravel the truth behind a string of arson attacks, racketeering conspiracies and brutal murders, battling the L.A. underworld and even members of his own department to uncover a secret that could shake the city to its rotten core.

&gt;Using groundbreaking new animation technology that captures every nuance of an actor's facial performance in astonishing detail, L.A. Noire is a violent crime thriller that blends breathtaking action with true detective work to deliver an unprecedented interactive experience. Search for clues, chase down suspects and interrogate witnesses as you struggle to find the truth in a city where everyone has something to hide.

To enter, comment here with a number between 0-649 (yes 0 is pick-able) 

Numbers that are NOT IT: 420, 69, 42

One extra chance at entering though. For the chance at picking 2 numbers: Tell me a good (Non superhero) comic book to read. Just finished The walking dead, and want more to read on my tablet, but am not into the superhero scene. I don't mind odd things like monsters and magic, and shit, just not superman/spiderman/the like.

For every non entry that recommends a comic to me, i will cancel out a number from the list. 

If you post 2 numbers and don't offer up a comic, i will go with your first number. 

If you post a number that has already been submitted before you, or is on the NUMBERS THAT ARE NOT IT list, i will just ignore your post, normally i try and remind people, but come on guys, you can do it yourself.

1340905246.0,19,self.playitforward,vr1fu,"[Pif] Various indie games in alphabetical order. This week: games beginning with C, D &amp; E.",19,0,61,http://www.reddit.com/r/playitforward/comments/vr1fu/pif_various_indie_games_in_alphabetical_order/,"It has been nearly a fortnight. Let's do this again.  

The idea is, I'll list some games beginning with this week's letters. If a couple or more people both want a specific game, I'll pif at least one copy of it. 
 
* You can suggest more games for me play forward, as long as you tell me why they're interesting.
* You can ask for up to three games, but not ""all"" or ""whatever is left"". Doing that tells me that you aren't interested in any of them - you just want free crap.
* I may pif all of the games forward, or one maybe one game several times. It depends what people want.


[**Chantelise**](http://store.steampowered.com/app/70420/) Don't ask for this if you only know about this game from the creators (&amp; translators) previous release: Recettear. Why? Because they are radically different games. Also, the difficulty of the game (healing items drop randomly and can't be stored for later use) tends to turn people off. However, this RPG is interesting in that you don't level, you instead use money to purchase better stats. This mechanic will seem familiar to those of you who have played custom maps for Warcraft 3, but hopefully new to the rest. The main reason I'm playing this forward is the care and attention that the translators (or localizationers, maybe) paid in bringing Chantelise to an English-speaking audience. See what they have to say about translating [here](http://www.carpefulgur.com/faq.html).  

[**Chime**](http://store.steampowered.com/app/62100/) the [tutorial video](http://store.steampowered.com/video/62100) does an EXCELLENT job at showing off the mechanics at play. For those who can't watch, I'll do a crappy job summarizing Chime: it is a block placement game using [pentonimos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentomino). where musical complexity grows as you place more pieces on the board. 

[**Cogs**](http://store.steampowered.com/app/26500/) Once again: watch trailer. Now you understand why it is interesting.

[**Desktop Dungeons**](http://www.desktopdungeons.net/) This roguelike solves a couple different problems of the genre, in much the same way as Binding of Isaac does. Dungeon runs are over (one way or another) in 15 minutes, meaning that you can play it in short bursts. The unlocking mechanism encourages you to play as every different combination of race and class, in each of the different scenarios. Also: I have played the [free alpha](http://www.desktopdungeons.net/?page_id=11) for longer than I care to admit.

**Dominion** [Official page](http://www.riograndegames.com/games.html?id=278), [Wikipedia Page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominion_%28card_game%29), [Dominion Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/dominion/)  
Physical Card Game for 2-4 players. The versatility and re-playability make this game a joy. To explain: there are 25 different ""kingdom cards"" in here, but in each match you only use 10 of them. Depending on which 10 are available (and what your opponent uses) will determine your strategy, since you'll try and use cards that complement each other. I cannot recommend this game enough. Also interesting is that the box the cards come in has a seperate slot for each and every type of card, making sorting/starting so easy.  

[**Dreamscape**](http://www.desura.com/games/dreamscape) You have magical headphones that can explore the dreams &amp; imagination of characters you meet, even the characters you meet in those dreams. That's interesting. Also: be prepared for an overload of ""cute"", in 16bit style graphics.  

[**Dungeons of Dredmor**](http://store.steampowered.com/app/98800/) Comic Roguelike with great customization. More will be said later.

[**E.Y.E. Divine Cybermancy**](http://store.steampowered.com/app/91700/) This game does people's heads in. I don't blame you if you have a hard time getting into it. Nearly nothing is explained to you, so you'll have to browse through the in-game menus to discover your options. And my goodness, there are a lot of options. I haven't been given this many options on how to dispatch an enemy in a long time. It is odd seeing a different focus on some game elements we take for granted. Looting dead enemies is unnecessary as you can bring whatever equipment you desire, and death isn't a big penalty.  

**Cards Against Humanity** [as recommended in this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/playitforward/comments/vr1fu/pif_various_indie_games_in_alphabetical_order/c57ip63)

**EDGE** thankyou DizzyEevee for reminding me. A visually minimalist isometric platformer, that is not minimalist on the features that we expect from a modern platformer. Also, respect for the developer *Two Tribes* - they modified their other games for the potato sack ARG, and at least one of the steam sale achievement hunts. Plus, they added an extra 45 levels to EDGE for free.  

**Defcom** as recommended in [this comment below](http://www.reddit.com/r/playitforward/comments/vr1fu/pif_various_indie_games_in_alphabetical_order/c57p136).  

**THIS LIST IS NOT COMPLETE. I need you to recommend (in the comments below) more games for me to play forward**  

Not playing forward and why: Escape goat *was recently in Indie Royale bundle.* Cthulu saves the world *free if you buy [Penny Arcade's OTRSPOD3](http://store.steampowered.com/app/213030/) before Monday.* Cave story+ - *the original Cave Story is free in full if you're on the fence about buying it.* Dungeon defenders - *way too grindy, been on sale/free so much now, deluge of DLC*",Closed,False,,t5_2s4e5,1341129816.0,closed,,True,t3_vr1fu,http://www.reddit.com/r/playitforward/comments/vr1fu/pif_various_indie_games_in_alphabetical_order/,

(that statement has LAYERS to it. oooh, ahh.) 

Here's the deal. Right now, in my Steam Inventory, there are 4 games. One of them is great. That is all i'm going to tell you. (sort of.)  Whoever wins this PiF gets all four games. 

To enter, Guess a number between 50 and 5000, don't forget your steam profile name in the comment. (if somebody guesses my number and already has the game(s) in question, I will let them know and have my random number generator pick a new number. 


Lastly, because I'm not a jerk, here are the MINIMUM Specs required to enjoy the 'grand prize' game, copied directly from steam. 


Supported OS: Microsoft® Windows® /XP/Vista
DirectX Version: DirectX 9.0c
Processor: Intel Pentium 4 2.4 GHz or Athlon 64 +2800  Athlon XP series, such as the Athlon XP +2400, is not supported
Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce 6600 or ATI Radeon 9800 or better 
Memory: 1 GB RAM 


So who's brave enough to play? 

Who's beggy enough to not care if they get a steaming pile of poop game?

**Edit** Selection ends at 9:05pm Tuesday night. 


**EDIT EDIT** If for some reason you just want to guess at the 'big game' please feel free to do it in PM's.  I may or may not tell you if you are right!

**THE JUST GOT HOME FROM WORK EDIT**  Nobody has guessed the number, a few people have guessed the game.  So here's the deal. my original number is still in effect, but I went and kicked my random number generator until he gave me a new number. (He's a little bit special, and kept saying numbers under 50... kinda like some of the posters.) 

The new random number he gave me **HAS** been selected, but i'm not going to award it to that person until 9:05 Pacific time tonight.   If the original number is guessed, then it will go to them. 

I'll see you guys in 3 hours!

**The 9:05pm Winner edit!!!**

Alright kids, The Winner is Jam2Go! having guessed the same number that my ~~tortured, wailing little brother~~ Random Number Generator spit out after nobody guessed the first random number. 

I have sent him a steam friend invite, and I will post the four games after he has accepted them all. I have checked his steam profile and know that he doesn't have any of the games, and I won't give him any of the games until he accepts the first one. 

Cause i'm a jerk like that.

**The REVEAL EDIT!**

Jam2go has added me as a steam friend and has added the following games to his library!

Bad Rats! (EVERYBODY POINT AND LAUGH.) 
Bunch of Heroes (this game is really kind of awful... the soundtrack is so varied though!... except it's not) 
Breath of Death VII! (This game is actually really good!) 

And, as Many of you guessed, 

The Witcher: Enhanced Edition! 

Thanks for the great PiF guys, I'll be back again in a few weeks with more!

I am continuing my year of PIF with volume 4! 

I have learnt a lot about what you guys like and dislike in my previous PIF posts and this one takes all the feedback I have received into account. 

As stated previously, all my PIF posts will have contests or tasks that will remain open for 15 days with MULTIPLE winners daily. (This one will have one winner daily)


**[1]** [THIS](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0An9wNJsgKPBYdDdtQTZ3ZV94ekI4QUZIX3AtVkxtUmc&amp;hl=en_US#gid=0) is what you can potentially win!


Till April 30, I am working over 70hrs a week and do not have the time for elaborate PIFs of the past. 

When I have more time, I will resume the more complicated PIFs

______________________________________

**Here is what happens in this PIF:**


Join my **[2]**[steam group](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/redditgiveaway) (OPTIONAL FOR THIS PIF - but may enable you to participate in random giveaways)


Post a caption for the picture of the day (you can find this below) as a TOP LEVEL COMMENT


*Please* refrain from other top level comments unless prefaced by /not entering or [NON ENTRY]


If you are not entering, please do not also provide a caption


Only one top level comment per person please


If you are declared the winner, add me as a friend on steam to claim your prize. (The prize will be decided by me based in part on your steam rating / ratio / games currently owned by you on steam)


I will try posting an identical PIF post every day with a different picture, and will leave them open for entry for 24-48 hours.

______________________________________

**Special Notes:**


Pif Rules Apply (Karma / Account Age)


You must not have the game you win!


Before the prize is given, the above will be verified and you may be disqualified


The prize list will constantly be modified as trades are made to increase the amount of games I have


I may have RL matters to attend to so posts may occasionally be late or winners may not be announced on time. 

Thanks for your understanding!

The previous event(s) are over. Please do not have a sense of entitlement or complain about your banked points. You had the option to use them and you yourself chose to save them for later, with no guarantees when this would happen. 70+hrs a week is no joke and almost everyone was unwilling to host the event on Nyan's behalf.

______________________________________

Also, ongoing side mission. Anyone who gets this steam group (or pif thread) or knowledge about these series of giveaways to FP of reddit (and I mean a normal FP that a non-logged in user would see) will instantly win SKYRIM!

They can play any game available to the account for up to 30 days. When your time is up or you are done with the account, a moderator will make a new thread and pass the account along again.

Here are the current games: http://steamcommunity.com/id/PiFAccount/games/?tab=all

To be eligible for this PiF you must meet the following requirements:

Your reddit account must be 8 months old, your steam account must be at least a year old.

So post your steam community urls along with a list of games you are interested in playing on this account.

Let me be very clear: This is not an account you get to keep. You can use it for up to 30 days, you aren't allowed to let anyone else use it. You are responsible for the account, so if something happens to it, it will be your fault. You do something stupid on the account like get it Vac Banned, you will be banned.

I'm also aware of the Steam ToS, I did not create the account, but since it does exist might as well use it. I don't like seeing the games people put on the account go wasted.

I am continuing my year of PIF with volume 4!  I have learnt a lot about what you guys like and dislike in my previous PIF posts and this one takes all the feedback I have received into account.  As stated previously, all my PIF posts will have contests or tasks that will remain open for 15 days ~~with MULTIPLE winners daily.~~ (This one will have one winner daily)

[THIS](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0An9wNJsgKPBYdDdtQTZ3ZV94ekI4QUZIX3AtVkxtUmc&amp;hl=en_US#gid=0) is what you can potentially win!

Till April 30, I am working over 70hrs a week and do not have the time for elaborate PIFs of the past.  When I have more time, I will resume the more complicated PIFs

------------------

Here is what happens in this PIF:

* Join my [steam group](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/redditgiveaway/) (OPTIONAL FOR THIS PIF - but may enable you to participate in random giveaways)
* Post a caption for the picture of the day (you can find this below) as a **TOP LEVEL COMMENT**
* Please refrain from other top level comments unless *prefaced* by **/not entering**
* If you are not entering, please do not also provide a caption
* Only one top level comment per person please
* If you are declared the winner, add me as a friend on steam to claim your prize. (The prize will be decided by me based in part on your steam rating / ratio / games currently owned by you on steam)
* I will try posting an identical PIF post every day with a different picture, and will leave them open for entry for 24-48 hours.



--------------

**Special Notes**


* Pif Rules Apply (Karma / Account Age)
* You must not have the game you win
* Before the prize is given, the above will be verified and you may be disqualified
* The prize list will constantly be modified as trades are made to increase the amount of games I have
* I may have RL matters to attend to so posts may occasionally be late or winners may not be announced on time.  Thanks for your understanding!
* The previous event(s) are over. Please do not have a sense of entitlement or complain about your banked points.  You had the option to use them and you yourself chose to save them for later, with no guarantees when this would happen.  70+hrs a week is no joke and most everyone was unwilling to host the event on my behalf

------------------

**Also, ongoing side mission.  Anyone who gets this steam group (or pif thread) or knowledge about these series of giveaways to FP of reddit (and I mean a normal FP that a non-logged in user would see) will instantly win SKYRIM!**

This probably doesn't count for points, since it is a board game, but I'd still request that you meet the normal PiF standard (karma, etc.)

In addition to video games, I really love board games. Carcassonne isn't the most advanced game ever, but my wife and I have put countless hours into this with friends. So I'm gifting one copy to an interested party. If you are interested, tell me why you want it, and who you want to play with.

http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/822/carcassonne

I've got an exam tomorrow, so I probably won't choose a winner until tomorrow evening.

Also, please be within the united states so that I don't get hit with crazy shipping costs. Good luck.

EDIT: I would also like to note that the purpose (and name) of playitfoward is to receive something, enjoy it, and then return the favor by giving out the same gift to another. So please, if you are interested, and especially if you win, be willing to play it forward later. I almost certain that you will like the game no matter who you are, but if for some reason you don't give out another game instead. BEST!

EDIT2: Boy, this is hard. I've done several PiF's in the past, but I must say this is the first time where I really thought that everyone would make a fantastic recipient. I think collectively, the redditors participating today are the longest tenured of any PiF I've done. I also see a lot of people who want to use board games as a way to connect with their significant others, family and friends, which I fully endorse and see as the most important aspect of board games. Ultimately I am choosing misterbeaver though, because, well you know why. To everyone else, thank you. I've really enjoyed reading all of your replies. I'm a lover of games, and Carcassonne has spent more time on my table than any other game I can think of, so if you didn't win today, please consider picking it up anyways. I assure you that it is worth your time and money (it's only $20).

I bought a copy of this game for my grandfather, but he's not really interested in it, so I decided I'd pass it along to PiF.  It's a great puzzle game that I've already dumped 10 hours into. The puzzles get incredibly difficult, so don't get this if you're not willing to put a lot of thought into it.

[Metacritic Reviews](http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/spacechem)

**Rules for valid entries:**

* Your entry must contain at least one good reason you want this game
* A link to your Steam ID/profile
* Your reddit account must have been registered for **at least** 2 months and/or have 300 combined link/comment karma (as per the rules in the sidebar)
* Your Steam account must be active, at least 4 months old, and at least 3 games outside of games in Humble Bundles and other similar bundles.
* Finally, a number between 1-100.
* Any entry failing to meet these requirements will not be considered in the drawing.

**Notes about the giveaway:**

* The drawing will be done in **1 day**.
* I do not believe being partial to any one person is ethical in giveaways, therefore your ""one good reason"" will only be factored into your chance to win in that I will read it to make sure you at least put some thought into why you want it rather than just blindly entering and hoping for free vidya.
* The winning number will be drawn using random.org. If no one guesses the exact number, the closest number will be the winning number.
* If there are two ""closest numbers"" on either side of the winning number (e.g. the winning number is 90 and two people guessed 88 and 92), then I will round **UP** and that number will win (using the previous example, 88 would win).
* If more than one person guesses the correct number, I will arbitrarily assign an equal portion of the number line to each valid entry (e.g. entry 1 gets numbers 1-50, entry 2 gets numbers 51-100), then use random.org to draw another number.  Whoever's portion of the timeline that number falls inside will be the winner.
* I will PM the winner letting them know they have won, then add them to Steam so that I can complete the transaction.  For future reference, here is my [Steam profile](http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197987455698).

I'm not generally one for Random Acts of Kindness, but Reddit has put me in the mood lately. I will gift five separate people one game of their choice (see restrictions below) from [Good Old Games, or GoG.com](http://www.gog.com). No particular rules. I'll choose people based on comments that I like.

I'm a poor Student, so let's add some qualifiers to avoid disappointment: nothing over $4.99 (that means virtually every game except Witcher 2 qualifies since they're all half off.) Let's not be greedy. One person per game please. The winner chooses the game.

Let the... something... begin.

Edit: ~~Courtana wins the first game cause... first comment. Why not? Plus the word Psychonauts is cool. 4 left!~~ tdoc2 wins as Courtana declined her prize. Lucky you!

Edit 2: Cheesecakefox wins whatever game s/he wants because of [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/playitforward/comments/iyh0p/pif_commander_keen/c27nsee). I. Fucking. Love. That. Theme.

Edit 3: orijinal wins the third game because 17 is a lot higher than 3, and that deserves some love. No, I don't care that s/he's a mod. Two left, which I'll probably do in the morning because I want to give people a chance to take a crack at things!

Edit 4: that_was_a_pune wins game number 4 because of awesome username plus I hate EA.

Edit 5: CognitiveDissident wins game #5! Everyone loves GoG and DRM free stuff. Right?

I will be gifting all five games at the same time, so please be patient while I choose 5 winners.

To all those offering me things in return for picking you: Thanks, but no thanks! This is Play it *Forward*, so if you do get picked, do what you said you'd do for me for someone else!

**Edit: So I feel kinda bad cause I hate being the one who always loses these things. In that spirit, I'll be giving away three ADDITIONAL (for a total of 8) GoG.com games $2.99 or less (which means they are the $5.99 ones since they're all half off.)**

I know they're not eligible for points, but I have 2 DOTA2 Beta keys I'd like to see not go to waste.  None of my friends play MOBA games so I'm passing this along to Reddit.

I'd like to hear about your favorite game/s of all time, and why.  I don't care if it's something widely considered terrible like Superman 64, if you and your friends would get stoned off your asses and had a blast playing it, I want to know about it.

To win, you must have a Steam account with at least 3 paid games (link it for proof) and your Reddit account must be at least a month old.  Preference will be given to positive ratio PIFers followed by MOBA players past and present (post your LoL/HoN profile if applicable) - no offense but they'll get more out of it than someone who has never touched a MOBA in their life.  I consider myself decent at LoL, and haven't played DOTA in years, and I'm receiving a LOT of verbal abuse in the adjustment phase, I'd hate to pass that aspect of the game onto someone that's going to get discouraged and quit after 2 rounds.  :(

Good luck to all.  :)

Mods can contact me for names if needbe for points divvying, if the receivers get negative points.",,False,,t5_2s4e5,True,,,True,t3_mo5u5,http://www.reddit.com/r/playitforward/comments/mo5u5/pif_2_dota2_beta_keys/,

On Thursday my roomate made a stupid bet with me, and I won 10 dollars. So I am going to gift a steam game away for 10 bucks. 

To enter you need to post a number between 1 and 500 and I will pick one when this reaches 500 numbers or after work tomorrow. 

Also my uncle died on Friday evening so if I am a bit slow it's due to being with my family, but I'll get to it no later then Tuesday. 

**Extended until Tuesday after I visit my grandpa**

Edit: up to 10 USD/ 10 Euro

Edit 2: if someone picks the same numbers I will have another number draw between them",,False,,t5_2s4e5,True,,holiday11 alt,True,t3_mb40q,http://www.reddit.com/r/playitforward/comments/mb40q/pif_steam_game_10_free_of_choice/,

I'm not sure if this is allowed seeing as it's techincally going to cost a redditor a little bit of money rather than getting it for free but it's the only way I could think of playing it foward now rather than later.

I have a [voucher](http://i.imgur.com/Oaadj.jpg) from the recent eurogamer expo good for one OnLive console which is worth [£70](https://www.onlive.co.uk/store/order). I've been told that you will need to pay shipping on top of the £1 so altogether it comes to around £7 I think? Might depend on where you live in the UK. 

This is also really important!! OnLive are currently doing a deal for new users where you can get your first game for £1. You absolutely must do this before you use the code or you will lose out on that deal.

As for how to choose who gets it, just make a post in this thread. I'll pick someone at random after 24 hours and PM them the code. Just definitly be sure that you can use the voucher as it expires on November 2nd and it would be a shame to see it go to waste.

So to recap. Onlive console voucher for £1 + shipping plus your first game for £1 which you must get first. Post and I'll pick someone at random after 24 hours to recieve.

A big shoutout to blakeh who recently gave me a game and inspired me to pif.
