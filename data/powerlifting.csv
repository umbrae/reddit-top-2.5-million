Did a 12 hour weigh in and came in under at 146.2lb. Did a simple water load during the week to lose 5ish lb. Ate and drank a shit ton which backfired on me because I shat 4 times that day.

Squat: (3/3: 375, 395, 415) in training I started to get a feeling for oly shoes since I squat narrow stance but I wasnt quite used to them so I stuck with my minimalist shoes. Warmed up and felt good with 375 and my second at 395 felt just as easy. My friend told me I took it too deep so I decided to just hit the sweet spot for a PR of 415.

Bench: (2/3: 275, 295 (x), 295) I thought for sure I was going to get 305-310 for bench but my second attempt hand off got botched because the pins were set too high. This threw me off and I lost my tightness and air. I still pressed it up but my butt came up. Took it for a 3rd because I wanted to solidify a higher total and got it.

Deadlift: (3/3: 440, 475, 500) I never feel like I have a handle on my DL and it feels different every time I pull heavy in training. 440 flew up and 475 felt solid so I rolled the dice on a 500lb pull and got it. This was a 15lb PR.

Overall RPS ran a great meet and it was smooth. I hit a bunch of PRs and RPS records (i think?) and won best male lifter in the raw + no wraps division (out of 20). My last meet a year ago I totaled 1065lb.

With LiftWhat, you can put your lifts in, get your routine for the next few weeks, then bookmark that page so you can reference quickly from your phone in the gym.

Figured I'd post here first as I see you getting the most benefit from it.

Feel free to let me know if you find bugs, inaccuracies, or you have feature requests at admin at liftwhat dot com. I am maintaining it in my spare time, but the fixes should come pretty quickly.

Thanks!

EDIT:

Thanks everyone for all the great feedback and kind words! You are awesome. Action items for the next release tomorrow night:

* Free text inputs instead of dropdowns
* Option for rounding the weight numbers (e.g., 184 would show as 185)
* Adding in Smolov Jr., Smolov bench.

Following release:

* Include 5x5, 5/3/1, SS, and some old olympic weightlifting routines I need to dig up

KG has already been added. Sorry for the delay my metric friends!

For my first meet, I chose the SPF Ohio State Championships at the Sweatt Shop in Cincinnatti, OH. Laura Phelps-Sweatt, her husband Shane and their entire crew put together a fantastic meet with great judging including none other than Louie Simmons himself. The judging was fair and accurate for all lifters, with proper depths being called and rules being enforced properly but not excessive. The meet ran smoothly and there was plenty of seating and warmup room and equipment. The gear used was top notch and I can say ill be returning to their December meet.

Now, for the powerlifting community as a whole. You will never meet a more helpful, motivating group than a room full of powerlifters. Whether it was squat warmups, bench or deads, someone was always willing to help out! I needed a depth caller when I was there and Shane Sweatt (Laura Phelps' husband) told me he would do it and didnt let me down. Throughout the meet, seasoned vets were talking and joking with everyone, and it seemed like everyone was having a great time! I BS'd with Jason Coker and Luke Edwards for a while and hearing these guys talk and give guys crap and also take jokes showed these are just every day guys with extraordinary talent ad work ethic. Jimmie Pacifico was another that made an impression on me. Good to see such a good head on a guy so young (i mean he is my age but he could be a lot cockier than he is). I met a guy in squat warmups and the rest ofthe meet we were jacking each other up and shoving nose tork in each others faces and helping each other along. Everyone there really wanted everyone else to succeed and that will leave a lasting impression on me. Powerlifting really is the best sport on the planet.

Finally, a name to learn is Brantley Thorton. This 181lber walked into his first meet and broke the 181 all time world record total with a 1800 raw! Not only is he a great kid, but tough as nails and a name to watch going forward. Ill post links soon to his lifts. Oh, and just in case you were wondering, I competed in the 259 raw class and had lifts of 735, 435 and 670 for an 1840 Elite total

What can I do to improve or what have you guys done to get past sticking points? Or even, if you would like to ask me any questions.

My bench is horrible. My opener was 215, I got that, bumped to 230, got that, and then bumped to 255 and got that with one red light.

At this time, I was in second place, first place had me beat by 75 lbs, my opener on deadlift was 485, and 1st places was 405...whew. I ended up having to try 520 lbs to tie his total, and I got it even though I felt like I was going to throw up all over the judges. Oh man I was so happy!

Weighed in at 86.4kg, right between two classes. Since it was my first meet, I didn't bother trying to cut down.
Primary goals were (1) don't bomb, (2) total 1000+ lbs and (3) go 9 for 9. Now that I'm looking at the video, I'm kicking myself a little that I didn't push my third attempts farther. After squatting 180kg, I looked up the state record for submasters in that weight class, and it was only 187.5kg, I think I might have had a shot. Maybe at the next meet?

Any comments on form and technique welcome. I know my bench is laughable and I need to get wrist wraps...

I entered the 93kg (205lbs) class in the Open and Junior divisions.

**Weigh in**

84.8kg (187lbs)

I wanted to be on the light end to have a good shot at winning best lifter but didn't expect to be this light.  I don't feel like I lost any strength dieting because I just stopped being a fatass.

**Squat**

230kg (507lbs)   240kg (529lbs)   247.5kg (545lbs)

My first time going 3/3 in squat in 6yrs of competing!  To make it even better both the 240 and 247.5 were PRs over my old best of 237.5.  
One odd thing was my shoes.  I have been squatting and deadlifting in Vivo Barefoot shoes (similar concept to Vibram FiveFingers) for about 3yrs but was told after my first attempt to find ""indoor sport shoes"".  Luckily I had some friends with Chucks.  That was a little annoying but I don't think it hurt my performance.

**Bench Press**

175kg (385lbs)   180kg (396lbs)   ~~185kg (407lbs)~~

Maybe the weight loss did have an effect.  About 4 weeks out I did 405lbs for 5 paused singles but I weighed 200lbs then.  Nevertheless I hit a 5kg meet PR.  Here's a [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bsv0XGmOZaw) of the 180kg.

**Deadlift**

265kg (584lbs)   ~~285kg (628lbs)   285kg (628lbs)~~

The 285kg felt easier than 265kg until the last few inches.  I just couldn't lock it out.  That really sucked for two reasons.  If I pulled that I would have been best lifter (lightweight and junior) and I hate regressing.  Missing it at the Arnold means my deadlift and total went down.

**Results**

My total was 692.5kg (1526lbs), which was good for 3rd in the 93kg class and 2nd best junior by Wilkes.

Friday and Saturday morning I was just bummed about the deadlift.  Now that I've had a few days to watch the other lifters and relax I'd say that miss is more motivating for next year than bothersome.  Also, I'm happy to have hit PRs in 2 of 3 lifts and been in the mix.",,False,,t5_2s4tp,False,,,True,t3_qhfmq,http://www.reddit.com/r/powerlifting/comments/qhfmq/my_arnold_raw_challenge_report/,

I competed today at the RPS Heatwave meet in Merrick, NY (Long Island). The meet was held at Crossfit Strong Island. I placed first in the 165 lb class with a 1100 lb total, an overall meet PR for me. I also made PRs in all three lifts. Here's a video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIzlKIitcKI

The breakdown:

**Squat**

1st: 350 - good

2nd: 375 - good (5 lb PR)

3rd: 390 - fail 

**Bench**

1st: 245 - fail (rushed press command)

2nd: 255 - good

3rd: 275 - good (25 lb PR)

**Deadlift**

1st: 425 - good (5 lb PR)

2nd: 450 - good (now 25 lb PR!)

3rd: 470 - fail 

All in all it was a great experience; one of the best-run meets I've ever attended. My thanks to Gene Rychlak and all the folks at RPS.

* Nutritious in the sense that it fuels workouts (ENERGY)

* Nutritious in the sense that it assists recovery (RECOVERY)

* Not so expensive that you can't eat it consistently (EXPENSE)

* Tasty enough that you can eat it consistently (TASTE)

* Good trade-off between how much time it takes to prepare and the volume of food you get from the preparation (EASE)


Would you please share some of your favorite recipes and rank them from 0 - 10 according to the criteria above? I'll start:


""Soylent Green"" Shake:

* 2 cups raw oats

* 1 banana

* 1 tablespoon coconut oil

* 1 tablespoon walnut oil

* 1 tablespoon olive oil

* 1.5 cups spinach

* 3 cooked egg whites (You can microwave these.)

* 2 tablespoons sunflower butter

* 1/4 cup plain whole fat yogurt

* 4 cups whole milk


Take all items and blend them in a blender. I think this is about 1500 calories.


Here is my ranking for this recipe:

ENERGY: 7 (It contains lots of oats and fats. It can keep you from getting hungry for awhile.)

RECOVERY: 5 (It has a medium amount of protein.)

EXPENSE: 4 (The oils are expensive.)

TASTE: 8 (This shake is actually pretty tasty.)

EASE: 10 (It's a shake. ;) )",,False,,t5_2s4tp,False,,,True,t3_1cug1v,http://www.reddit.com/r/powerlifting/comments/1cug1v/recipes_from_powerlifters/,

Not only did I witness Stan Efferding set the new raw record, we all also had the privilege of having Ed Coan judging all of our lifts! That is like playing a game of HORSE with Michael Jordan. I didn't note the exact total Stan accomplished but I know it is above the 2200 mark, the video is my view of him pulling 833.3lbs to set the record. You can see Mark Bell in the background of the video, Ed Coan is the first person to shake Stan's hand after completing the deadlift. Sorry for the vertical video. Scot Mendelson also attempted to break his raw bench press record, but he seemed to pull his left peck on the attempt, his second. If anyone is interested, which I'm sure you're not, I totaled 1058.2lbs at 222.5lbs for my first meet. 

Edit: according to powerliftingwatch he hit 2302!

ESPECIALLY on bench.

So we trained for months and months and got ready for the mini-meet in December (my first meet), it was only a push/pull so we concentrated on just doing deadlift and bench for the meet.  About 4 weeks out we started doing simulated meet setups with the timing and singlets and all, and I was all ready up to do a 415 bench and a 500 deadlift!  George asked what I wanted to open with and I said 365, he said 'how about 315, get that, hit 350 then try 400?'.  I wasn't sure why he would want me to open with 100# LESS than my best gym lift (technically 425 was my best gym lift, but my foot came up so I don't count it).  He explained the following:

""Gym lifting is not meet lifting.  In the gym you can get away with slop, there is no real pressure other than the weight itself.  You bomb out in the gym, it's no big deal - you bomb out in a meet and you're done for the day.  Open with a lift you know you'll hit easy and take that pressure out of your mind"".

Day of the meet, went and warmed up on bench (I totally screwed up my food for the day - I should have brought more, but oh well), got everything nice and loose and hit a 315 for 1 like it was a textbook lift.  It might as well have been an empty bar I felt so good!  I get out to the platform and MISS THE LIFT I JUST HIT 10 MINUTES EARLIER IN WARMUP!!  Like, not redlit - actually had to have them grab the bar and take it.  I completely overthought it, thought my ass was going to lift up, my sink/throw would go wrong, I'd flatten my back, foot will come loose, I'll drop one side, I'll beat the pause, absolutely everything but not be able to lift it.  Came back and nailed it on the next round and then missed 350 on my third.  So on a 415 1RM gym lift, my best meet lift was 315...

**Westside Barbell - Louie Simmons ""WSB""**

From Wikipedia: *Simmons has worked with twenty-five World and National Champion powerlifters, twenty-seven lifters who have totaled over 2000 pounds, and a World Record holder in the 400-meter dash (Butch Reynolds). He is a strength consultant for the Cleveland Browns, Green Bay Packers, New England Patriots, Seattle Seahawks and numerous college football teams.*

*Simmons is the owner and trainer of the legendary Westside Barbell, located in Columbus, Ohio. Westside Barbell advocate the use of a system they call the conjugate method, based loosely on the conjugate parallel system advocated by various strength coaches in the former Soviet Union.*

*The training week in the Westside Barbell system typically consists of four sessions per week. Two of these sessions focus on upper body work, using the bench press as the main lift. One upper body session is used to lift maximal loads while the other is used for dynamic work using lighter loads with higher speed. The other two sessions focus on lower body work, with the squat and deadlift being the primary focus. One day per week is a maximum effort session while the other is a dynamic effort session, typically using box squats with a fast speed and lighter loads than the max effort day.*

**Results**

**Video**

[Link.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zplZe0MzXtQ)  I know the angle isn't great and the first squat and half of the second squat are missing.  My dad was doing the filming and he isn't accustomed to using smartphones.

**Goals**
As usual, I had a prioritized list of goals. First, set a PR total. Second, set individual lift PRs. Third, win.  Fourth, go for records. I almost achieved them all.  You can see the results above.  In addition to that, I set some records.  Squat: PR at this bodyweight, which increased my PA state and American junior records.  Bench: PR for any bodyweight and increased my state record.  Total: PR for this bodyweight, which increased my state and American junior records.

**Making Weight**

I've been successfully lowering my offseason weight for about a year.  I was down to 187lbs six weeks out and 185lbs three weeks out.  I thought being that close would have made for an easy cut.  I was very wrong.  I ended up not eating or drinking anything for about 33 hours.  Given that I set a PR total, I don't think the cut hurt me too much.  

**Squat**

The first attempt got three white lights.  It was a little bit slow for an opener but felt easy enough to stick to my planned 10kg jump.  The second attempt was very slow out of the hole but fast on the top half.  I decided to be conservative and only go up 5kg rather than my planned 10kg jump.  I missed the third.  Part of the problem was that I got one red light for depth on the second attempt.  If I was going to miss a lift I wanted it to be because of strength, not depth, so I took the third attempt deeper than the first two attempts.  The video shows I managed to start to come up, but my quads quit on me before I got too far up.

**Bench Press**

I was nervous about my bench throughout training.  It was inconsistent and I was working around pain from a partially torn pec.  None of that mattered at the meet.  Everything was perfect and I was pain-free.  I got three white lights on every attempt.  Part of what made this so successful was my game plan.  I realized that I never went 3/3 benching so I dropped my opener to 165kg then went to a weight I had done within one week of the meet.  I had no say in the third attempt.  I told my handler to make the call because I tend to be too aggressive.

**Deadlift**

This makes two years in a row where I fell apart on the deadlift at the Arnold.  I've done about 20 meets over 8 years and have always been able to deadlift more in the meet than in training except at the Arnold.  Last year I thought the problem was a last minute change to my training.  This year I haven't thought of a good explanation yet.  Maybe that means I'm not as strong as I thought?  I opened heavier than ever with 280kg, and it went exactly as expected.  Then I tried 295kg--a 2.5kg meet PR--on my second attempt and missed it.  Twice.  I expected 295kg to be very hard but doable because I had pulled more in training.  I know gym lifts don't count, but I had the confidence to go for it because everywhere but the Arnold I've pulled more in competition than in the gym.  The way the meet played out, 295kg was the right call.  Anything less wouldn't have changed my placing in my weight class or for the payout.  Also, I was trying to beat the world record holder in the deadlift.  Had I gone for anything lighter I would have needed him to miss a lift.  I don't think hoping for a record holder to miss at his best lift is a good strategy (for the record, he did go 3/3 and increase the record to 310.5kg).

**Thoughts**

I'll start with the bad so I can end on a positive note (despite my complaints I am happy with the results). I’m starting to get frustrated that I can’t peak all three lifts at the same time.  It’s been about 2.5 years since I hit a PR in every lift at the 2010 American Open.  Going 6/9 is frustrating too.  I should be more consistent in my 8th year of competing.  The bottom line is compared to last year I lifted more weight, placed higher, and earned some prize money.  I can only be happy with that.",,False,,t5_2s4tp,False,,,True,t3_19lxo9,http://www.reddit.com/r/powerlifting/comments/19lxo9/meet_report_2013_napf_arnold_raw_challenge/,

I am a new Moderator for this sub and my first order of business is setting up a Virtual Powerlifting Competition. This will allow users to compete against each other virtually and provide motivation to continue training.

How this works:
I will maintain a Google Spreadsheet which has username and weight class. It will not be split into age class. Lifters will upload a video of their max and if it's deemed a good lift, I will update the spreadsheet to reflect the lift. I have a good idea of Spreadsheet layout.

To prove yourself, in the beginning of the video, you will need to hold up a piece of paper on video which says your username.

My first prototype spreadsheet for this competition can be found here: [Virtual Competition Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AmXLUXLcK55HdGROTlY0Y09iN1MzMzhpaGtoWkttSlE&amp;hl=en_US)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Virtual Powerlifting Competition (Beta rules)

Background: This is the official Reddit Virtual Powerlifting Competition. It allows Redditors to compete against each other in a Leader Board style competition which also has a specific ending date. 

How do I join:
To join the competition you need to comment or PM me your user-name and weight-class. Although I trust Redditors would not lie about your weight class, if you're using this as an introduction or prep-powerlifting competition, you may want to practice cutting weight prior to an actual event.

Rules: We are following the 100% Raw Powerlifting Federation rule book. This goes for equipment, form, commands, and so on.
http://www.rawpowerlifting.com/pdf/GeneralRules.pdf

Verification:
We are trying to keep the competition clean. We are trying to find the least tedious method of verifying weight class and under-names. Currently this is the method:

* You can weight in the day prior or the day of your max attempts. To prove your weight you must video tape or take a picture of yourself on a scale and showing a newspaper with your user-name written on it and which shows the date.

* Prior to the lifting video you must again show a newspaper or method of determine the date with your user name written on the paper. All three (Squat, Bench, and Deadlift) must be done during the same lifting session. 

* Your lifting video will be reviewed by myself and others to act as the judge. If the lift is deemed good than we will update the spreadsheet.

This is just for fun, so please do not try to beat the system.
If you have another other good ideas for the verification process or the competition in general, please let me know.

If you would like to be part of the competition, please comment or PM me your user name and weight class. You do not need actual lifts yet, I am just building a user name registry. 

Edit: I believe I have added all the names so far, please check the list and let me know if you need to be added.

I requested yesterday and today off from work so I could get enough sleep but my boss scheduled me to work until 11pm so I only got about 4 hours of sleep before having to head north. Also had a fever and sore throat. But hey, I was just thankful to get the day off to compete. My wife did a great job trying to keep me focused and confident even though I felt like hammered dog shit.

The APA has several fat kid weight classes: 308, 341 and SHW. I had some tough decisions to make about whether to go into the 341's or the SHW's depending on which records I wanted to attempt to break. 

Training leading up to the meet had been okay. I did well in a full power meet 5 weeks ago, took 3 weeks off because of a family emergency where I had to leave the state, and did the best I could to get in a couple strong sessions while not overdoing it. 

I weighed in at 342.25. The state record for the APA raw bench is 410 and the deadlift was 610. The American record in this category is 700.

Bench
Right before my attempt on the bench, I overheard one of the judges saying that the thumbless (false) grip on the bench wasn't allowed. I haven't used a full grip on a bench in years so it threw me a little. 
Attempt 1: 350 - EZ PZ
Attempt 2: 375 - Also PZ. By this time, the promoters had conferred and agreed that they had seen a recent rule change allowing the thumbless grip so I felt more comfortable, although the weights were feeling a little heavier.
Attempt 3: 400 - missed it about 6"" off my chest. Soon as it hit my chest it felt like a million pounds.

During the intermission, I was trying to sip energy drinks, water, and nibble on the pizza that they provided but it wasn't sitting well. I started warming up on the deadlifts really early in the hopes that it would kickstart my CNS into waking the fuck up. With things about as good as they were going to get, I hit the platform.

Deadlift
Attempt 1: 640 - good lift - I lowered my opener to 640 from 660 just to get something decent on the board. This was a state record.
Attempt 2: 670 - good lift - Felt like a grinder off the floor but the top end was easy enough. State record.
Attempt 3: 705 - good lift - I can't remember ever completing a deadlift that started this slowly. I busted capillaries all over my shoulders and face, but I locked that motherfucker out for another state and American record.   

I missed winning best lifter by something like 1.57 points. Would have won it if I kept my bw in the low 330's or made that 400lb bench, but really, I'm pretty happy with my performance given how I was feeling.

My trainer does an excellant job coaching me and others through sessions. I was proud to watch my numbers climb rapidly as I followed his lifting program. 

The problem came one night about 2 weeks ago when I was sitting in my recliner and couldn't make a fist with my right hand. My shoulder also ached. The next morning I work up and my right arm (starting at my shoulder blade) was bright reddish purple and my arm was rock hard and full of veins. 

Fast forward 6 days in the hospital. It turned out that I had 2 blood clots (deep vein thrombosis) DUE TO FRONT SQUATS AND BACK SQUATS. This clot extended from my bicep to my neck. 

This was such a freak thing for someone with no infections, no family history, no period of being immobile, healthy eating, non smoking, and to to have it in my shoulder. Doctors were completely baffled. 

Pressure from the weights across my shoulders and chest apparently stressed veins enough to begin clotting. 

I'm OK now but depressed as hell. The stay in the hospital was difficult mentally (3 days of catheterizing the clot to no avail, injections twice daily) and I won't be able to train with heavy weights again for the rest of my life. 

Be careful out there. I had no symptoms of this. Had I dismissed this asymmetry to a muscle tear or something, they said it would have moved to a pulmonary embolism quickly. 

[Edit/update] 
I have met with a series of doctors and a vascular surgeon. I don't have any markers or clotting condition. I just have a narrow opening between my collar bone and my top rib. Padge-schroetter Disease is the condition (aka Thoracic outlet Syndrome). 

It can be found in athletes who bear weight and stress on their shoulders. It is commonly found on the dominant arm. Hockey players, swimmers (I used to be one), volley ball players, and pitchers can develop this condition if their anatomy is similar to mine. 

Be careful out there. 

[Update2]

I found out today that there has been a link established between energy drinks and clots. I don't drink energy drinks and my form for squats was spot on. It's Thoracic Outlet Syndrome until proven otherwise. ",,False,,t5_2s4tp,1363043304.0,,,True,t3_163edv,http://www.reddit.com/r/powerlifting/comments/163edv/an_unexpected_sports_injury/,

I've been a member for a couple months now, and it's time to pay for the month of July. 

Anyway, he'd like $200 per month. I feel like this is on the high side for a gym. What do you guys think?

I've put on a little weight since I started, about a pound a week on average, and my strength has gone up.  It has been a very clean bulk.  However, I've begun to notice something about the lifters in the gym: half of them are very well-built, while the other half or so, while extremely strong, are also generally fatter looking.  I asked the guy who owns the gym, himself a former powerlifter, about gaining weight, and he basically said that any weight you put on is good weight, and that getting kinda fat can be OK in powerlifting because it will help your lifts.

I'm now trying to decide whether I want to continue clean-bulking only, or whether I'd rather start eating like a vacuum cleaner and get somewhat fatter in exchange for greater lifts.  My question is this: have any of you guys made a similar decision?  Was it worth it for you?  Is it worth it in powerlifting to get kinda fat?

So far I've worked up to the following:

* From 105 to 195 Bench

* From 135 to 275 Squat

* From 135 to 275 Deadlift (I know this should be higher but I've only been DLing for 4 weeks now. For some reason I avoided them for a loong time).

Do I have a chance? If so, how do I start powerlifting competitively?

Been progressing well with my squat using SL5x5, never experienced any back pain worth mentioning before today. Once I hit 100-105kg working sets, my lower back was starting to feel it, but not in a stabby pain way, more a muscle tired/sore way.

Today I was squatting 130kg working sets, failed my 3rd set on the last rep, and had a bit of a sharpish pain in the area shown in [this](http://i.imgur.com/2S5SfIr.jpg) image. My actual spine/back was completely fine, it was only the area off to the side.

It wasn't a stabby pain, more just a ""hey, that's a bit tender"". Dropped the weight right back down to single plates, did a few really slow squats concentrating on my form. Felt fine. 5 minutes later my back is completely fine again, no pain at all.

Anyway, figured I should take form check video and post it for you to critique. Was feeling a bit knackered by this stage (had just done bench/rows), and ignore the stupid shuffle at the start, a little pebble under my foot :)

##Pre-Meet    
I decided to do this meet about 2 months before the meet. I had been running Wendler 5/3/1 for about 4 months at that point. I haven't done a meet in about 6 years, and just decided I missed it. This was the closest meet to me this year, and I had never lifted in the NASA before, but I decided to just go for it. I bought my bench shirt about a month out, which turned out to be a huge mistake. The squat suit I used was one I had laying around from high school. I used an Inzer lever belt and some Inzer Iron Wrap Z knee wraps. I had already been cutting for about a month when I decided to do the meet, and was about 235 pounds at that point. A week before the meet I was sitting at 229 and had to cut pretty hard to make weight. The day of the meet I didn't eat or drink anything, and ended up making weight by .1 lbs. I weighed in at 220.1. I'm pretty sure cutting that much hurt me quite a bit, and looking forward I will try to stay as close to competition weight as possible. 

##Meet Day    
This was my first experience with the NASA federation, so I didn't really know what to expect. They had one platform going for everyone, and 3 flights on most lifts. The atmosphere was a little different than I remembered from high school, but everyone was really nice. I competed in the 220 lb Equipped Junior Division, and was the only competitor in my class.  
**Squat**    
I set my opening lift super low because I was nervous and just wanted to be sure I could do it with no stress. The only warmup I got was 225x5 because I waited too long and the flight moved faster than I was expecting, but my first lift went as planned \- super light. The State Record in my Division was 501 lbs, so I broke it on my second attempt of 507. That felt pretty light as well, so I went to 540 which would have been an all time PR for me. I got the lift, but I got called up just a tad early by my brother. It was definitely a doable weight, and I should have gone lower and gotten it.  

**Bench**    
Like I said, I only got my bench shirt about a month before the meet, and wasn't confident with it yet so I decided to do a super light raw first lift. The record in my division for bench was 375, so I was hoping to beat this one as well. 320 went up as planned, so I went to what I knew I could do in my shirt fairly easy, 408 lbs. I got the weight, but my butt came off the bench so I was red lighted. I stayed with the same weight for my 3rd attempt, and I focused on slamming my butt into the bench throughout the lift. I was pretty confident that I got it, but got 2 reds for my butt coming off again. This is the lift I was most disappointed with, because I had gotten 425 in the gym before. Either way, I had to kind of shake things off and get ready for deadlift.  

**Deadlift**    
Deadlift is by far my most comfortable lift, and the only one that I am somewhat happy with. I hadn't deadlifted in a squat suit before, so I picked another easy opener at 540 lbs. Got it pretty easily, and decided to break the record of 567 lbs for my second attempt of 573. It was a bit of a struggle, but I was still feeling pretty strong. Attempted 601 for my 3rd but just couldn't finish the lockout. I had gotten 600 in the gym about a month prior to the meet, but I weighed between 230 and 235 at that time, so the cutting probably hurt me here.  

##Post-Meet    
I was pretty mad at myself overall with this meet. I did set some meet PR's, but I kind of felt robbed with my squat and bench. If I would have just gotten my bench press my total would have been almost 90 pounds heavier. I got first in my division, although I was the only lifter ha. I did set 2 state records, but I feel like I could have set all 4. I will definitely try to stick to my competition weight for the next meet, seeing as cutting probably affected me quite a bit. I also need much more practice in my bench shirt. All in all, I'm glad that I went but it just made me want to do so much better.  

If anyone knows of any meets coming near North Texas soon, let me know! I checked powerliftingwatch.com but there weren't really any more listed besides a push-pull meet in September.

Last weekend  I competed in the 100% Raw Powerlifting Federation ""Ontario Open Championships."" It was a very good meet. 

I ended up winning the ""male best lifter"" award and the ""best deadlift"" award. My squat and deadlift went great, but failed hard on the bench press. Videos will be coming soon.

The cut prior to the event was the best yet, moving from 162 to 147.5 fairly effortlessly (in comparison to the past.) My friend drove to the weigh in with me with max heat (1 hour) I wore a garbage bag, sweater, sweat pants, and lost the 2.5 pounds I needed. 

Here is what I hit:
Squat: 463
Bench: 255
Deadlift: 551
Total: 1269 at 148.5

My videos are coming, I just need to reach lvl 60 in Diablo 3.

I've been doing KB and bodyweight stuff and it's been frustrating, but I'm returning to the gym this week.

Before I stopped I'd maxed out the ""newbie"" linear gains for deadlift (1x415) and bench (1x205), but my squat was continuing to scale upwards (5x308). My power clean was 3x187lb and press 3x154lb, but form was crap for both so I don't consider those numbers accurate and would probably rate them at lower than that.

When I last lifted I was 198lb and 6'0"", and now I'm 184lb and still 6'0"". I'm 27 and male if that's relevant at all.

How should I consider programming my return? My initial thought was do so a SS style program, starting off at 60% of my previous 1RM, then max test after a month or so. Good idea? Do I need to be more conservative given my weight loss since I last lifted, or could I jump into 5/3/1+BBB right away? Any help would be appreciated.

My goals are to push my maxes higher than they are (I'd like to have my DL over 500 by April, and Squat over 400 by year-end). I'd love to be able to work back to my previous maxes quickly, then run Coan-Phillipi over 5/3/1 for the other lifts.

8 or 9 weeks ago, i woke up with excruciating back pain.  I couldn't move.  I skipped all my classes and just laid in bed.  For a week.  I still dont know what it is/was but my left spinal erectors were super tight.  I could feel it shooting down my back if I leaned my head forward excessively.  It was miserable.

Then after going back to the gym once, i woke up the next morning in excruciating pain.  It was awful.  My friends forced me to go to the hospital.  Good thing too.  Appendicitis.  Apparently my appendix was so inflamed it had moved behind my colon.  Emergency surgery and 6 weeks of rest.  I came back at week 5 because I couldnt wait any longer, but still.  6 weeks of injury.

I've been back in the gym for two weeks now just getting back into the feel of things, doing whatever i feel like working on that day.  I dont want to start another program while my coach finishes his current cycle and we hire Mike Zourdos for a month or two to coach us

Today I was driving to the gym with the plan of benching.  Got to the gym and decided I felt like deadlifting.  Work my way up to 315 to start work sets.  It feels really good.  Decide to say to hell with work sets and just went for a max effort lift.  

315 - good  
365 - good  
405 - good

Doctor says it's bursitis, tendonitis and a slight impingement).   

Before I hurt my shoulder, I'd hit 405 raw clean, and 425 raw with my leg shooting out (so I don't consider that a good lift).  Best meet lift was 325 (proving once again, gym lifting and meet lifting are 2 different things).  

Anyways - warmed up with 135 for 10 raw, put on 'The Ram' for 6 with 225, 4 with 315, 3 with 365 and one of my compatriots offered to let me use his shirt (single ply Katana).  

First off, holy crap that thing is hard to get into!!  I have pretty big arms, so 2 trashbags and 3 people later we finally got it pulled up past my elbows.  Took a good 10 minutes of finagling and pulling before I was set.  I couldn't wrap my own wrists, I couldn't put on my own belt, pretty much just stood there like T-rex trying to eat a cheeseburger.  

My coach is 64 time world record holder George Herring (arguably one of the greatest natural lifters of all time, and certainly one of the strongest people under 200# ever to live), so he said I'd need at least 500# on the bar to make the shirt work.  

*gulp!*  

""500?"" I said meekly.  

""500!""

So we put 5 plates (and the requisite 2.5's on there) on and went for it.  

What a unique feeling that is... sitting there, 500# of steel directly over your sternum, losing feeling in your hands because of the super tight wrist wraps and tight sleeves, 3 spotters.  We take the weight out, George lines me up in the groove and yells 'GO!'.  I bring the weight down (we started with 2 boards for the feel) slowly, hear the 'PRESS!' and drive it out.  My first 500!  

Apparently it looked easy, so we went for it again without boards.  Took a wider grip and had some further explanation of curling up around the bar with a HUGE sink/throw (being barrel chested has it's advantages).  Took the bar out, got set into the groove, slowwwwwwly let it down, sinking the bar into my chest, holding my breath, feeling pressure throughout my body like I've never felt before and for a brief moment time almost stood still.  After what seemed like an eternity I hear 'PRESS!' and I EXPLODE my chest/stomach and rocket 500 pounds straight into a lock out.  

I now have bruises on both arms and across my chest from where everything pinched, but now I can say that I've bench pressed 500# with a single ply shirt.  =)

So, bench always has been my worst lift due to having really long arms. I don't really mind this since my deadlift makes up for it, but I've always been really put off by the fact that I'm significantly stronger with a close grip bench. That's right, I have 6'6"" monkey arms (I'm 6'3"") and my strongest pressing position is with my hands about two inches from the edge of the knurling. This inevitably causes my forearms to descend at an angle, rather than perpendicular to the ground, which I'm sure is less than ideal. And of course the main issue is it creates an absurdly long ROM. But despite all this, I can press at least 20 lbs more than if I widen my grip even an inch (my max is 265). If I widen to max legal grip, which by all accounts I really should be using, I'm even weaker.

On one hand, I've never fully committed to training with a wider grip for a long period of time, only played around with it here and there (and instantly felt weaker). So it could just be underdeveloped shoulders and overdeveloped triceps, and if I switched over I could train up my weak points. On the other hand, I try not to over-think things, and just go with what works. I know that while it is rare, there are some pretty strong ass dudes that use narrow bench grips. Konstantinovs is the best example. We're the same height, he has long arms, and seems to use about as narrow a grip as I do.

What do you guys think? I've been making good progress on 5/3/1 using my current narrow grip. I also use a narrow grip on rows and pullups, and an even narrower grip for press, and have made progress on all those too. But I'd like to start competing eventually, and want to start taking all the steps I can toward optimizing my form.",,False,,t5_2s4tp,False,,,True,t3_g9ifp,http://www.reddit.com/r/powerlifting/comments/g9ifp/raw_bench_grip_width/,

I've had to change my schedule from 3x week MWF mornings to the following:

**Monday Morning** - Bench with shirt, light chest/shoulder accessory work

**Tuesday Evening** - Squat with Suit, light ab and legs accessory work

**Thursday Evening** - Deadlift with Suit, Overhead press and some ab/lat accessory work

**Saturday Morning and Sunday** (across two days depending on when I feel up for it or have time) - *Unsuited*: Squat volume, Bench volume, Deadlift breakers, OHP volume and some accessory work (lats, B&amp;Ts, etc).

I weigh around 165 lbs, max lifts are as follows:

1 RM Deadlift 468 lbs

3 RM Squat 335 lbs (testing 2 rep today)

2 RM bench 205 lbs (weak, I know, for some reason I just suck at bench)

I also used to feel like the gym fit a lot more easily into my personal life.  Now that my recovery time is dictating my schedule, I'm having a hard time balancing the gym and a social life.  Does anyone have tips for this?

Is it normal to start getting sore again?  I've never used any PEDs.  I'm currently bulking, getting in ~200g protein a day and taking fish oil, creatine, vitamin D, magnesium and zinc supplements.  I sleep 7-9 hours a night consistently.

(Injury),9,2,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/powerlifting/comments/1dvu20/wearing_briefs_for_squatting_injury/,"For a while now I've had pain in my hip when squatting, it's more or less always been there but it gets pretty bad when I hit or go under parallel.  I've had 3 chiropractors and 2 doctors look at it and it's nothing major but basically the liquid that's in those joints has ""dried up"" so to say and I'm starting to develop arthritis in my hip sockets where the femur (or whatever bone) connects.  My father had lower back issues his whole life so it looks like it's genetic.

I've tried taking fish oil, stretching a ton, walking/jogging for 15 mins before and really nothing helps the pain go away completely so as a last ditch effort besides giving up squatting I bought a pair of Inzer Power Pants and that combined with box squatting has been the most effective tool to fight against my hip pain.  I know there's some people who are completely against gear and say to fix the problem instead of relying on gear but short of getting expensive surgery I can't afford and couldn't justify it unless I was a millionaire, I think wearing the briefs is probably a good option since it gives the compression my hips so badly need when squatting.

I am curious about whats optimal.

I currently bench 305(about 4 years), parallel squat 350(started squatting recently), and dead 525 (about one year) while walking around at 5'11'' @185. My dead just won't stop going up. 

Should I be lifting to the point where it makes me mildy sore, terribly sore, crippling sore, or just not sore?

My current split is: 

Sunday: squat 3 sets of 5 at 80% and throw in some biceps and calves

Tues: bench 3-4 sets of 5 at 80%, 3 sets incline bench for extra chest and shoulder work.

Thurs: dead 3x5 at 80%, 2-3 sets of pullups or rows or both, some triceps if I am not sore from Tues.

If you have any suggestions to the lift programming that is fine but this simplistic nature has done me well. This type of heavy lifting consistently gets me what I would say is a 6 out of 10 on my soreness index. 10 being: I just lifted for the first time and feel like I am dying. I seem to be the most sore after chest. 

In your experiences have you found that lifting 3 sets of 5 at 80% is too much? or in your opinion?

The first one I already know the answer to, but by god I'm asking it anyway until there's no one left to tell me NO. Right now I'm squatting 345(lbs, duh) &amp; deadlifting 420 &amp; bench notworthmentioning @ 169. Everybody says never to cut ever, but I am so frigging tempted to lean out my diet a bit and see how strong I can be in 75kg class. I'm 5'9"", so way too tall to actually stay in this class long term, but why would I add mass if my lifts aren't plateauing yet? 

Second is about records - I recently joined USAPL, and their national squat record @ 75kg is 242.5kg/534.5lbs. In the ADFPF its 202.5kg/446lbs. The WNPF shows a flat 500lbs. NASA's got 232.5/512.5. 75kg strangers on the internet squat 600 easy. At a GPA meet in georgia, Dan Dumitrache squatted 305/672. Obviously I'm not going to challenge any of these anytime soon, (or ever @75kg, because I'm not 5') but being 100lbs from any record is exciting regardless. SO. What is going on with the huge differences between these records? I want to be setting good goals for myself, and I can't figure out what lifts I should be aspiring to if I'm competing raw/un-juiced. Obviously these goals are ridiculous as I've only been lifting for a couple years, but still. Let a guy dream. Are some feds better about testing than others? A lot say ""drug free"" but don't say shit on their websites about testing. Are some just shitty so no actual powerlifters compete in them? I'm lost here.

I would lose my voice for months at a time and was constantly hacking and snorting.  It took quite some time to diagnose it as reflux as well, due to different opinions from doctors and me having pretty serious allergies too that would often mask and mix with the reflux symptoms.  Finally this past winter my doctor decided that it was indeed reflux and had me mega dosing some OTC meds to get it under control.  Also at this time, my wife asked me if I would do some 5k's with her next year.  Now I am not a runner at all.  Cardio to me is walking to the fridge generally, but I decided to do this for her and began training three times a week.  During this training, I also decided that, in order to keep my powerlifting training on track, something would need to give, so I decided to just work volume on deads for a while focusing on speed and technique at about 60% (405).   Fast forward 6 weeks and oddly my voice has come back and the constant congestion resuliting in snorting and hacking like a donkey are nearly gone.  Thursday, I decided that it was time to work back in heavy deads.  I worked up to a couple max singles in the low sixes and they felt awesome!  Hadn't felt that good pulling in awhile, but when I woke up the next morning guess what reflux is back and it has gotten progressively worse since Thursday.  
Long story short… Deadlifting aggravates my acid reflux to a point where it is unbearable.  Had anyone else experienced this and if so, how did you/do you manage it? 
Deadlifting is my favorite lift to train and it kills me that I have narrowed down the main agitator of my reflux to them.

My question is: Is there room to lose some body fat while retaining these numbers? I feel like a powerlifter with less body fat and body weight can lift just as much as I am right now (maybe I'm wrong in this regard).

I look up to Konstantin for inspiration because he's the exact same height as me (6'3"") and with a similar bodytype (mesomorph). I took particular attention to how he wears his belts during deadlifts and squats today (because I just got my Inzer lever belt). 

Here's him deadlifting:
http://powerliftinghub.com/images/konstantin_deadlift_430.jpg
Notice how high the belt is on his body? Is that generally how powerlifters roll, or is that just an idiosyncratic preference of Konstantin? 

Here's him squatting: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UV43lk29lE
Here, he wears the belt much lower, closer to the hips. This definitely makes sense for a movement like the squat. 

So putting one and two together, and assuming that KK is doing it ""right"" (if there is such a thing as ""right"" in this context), then I would infer that powerlifting belts should be worn higher for deadlifting and lower for squatting. 

Comments? 

One additional question:

KK undoubtedly inspires many because of his ""strong AND lean-ish"" physique (in contrast to ""strong but fat""). I know he was a bodybuilder before he was a powerlifter, so his physique is probably highly attributable to that. But setting bodybuilding (and pharmaceuticals, for that matter) aside, is KK's physique generally anomalous in the sport of powerlifting? If so, is it mostly anomalous due to a bias inherent in members of powerlifting, e.g. ""Man, fuck conditioning and dieting, I just wanna be strong!""? Or is it mostly anomalous due to difficulties inherent in the sport itself, e.g. ""Man, fuck this, trying to stay lean AND getting strong is feasible, but takes too much time and patience to compete successfully!""?

I also have since scrapped using a belt to focus on form and building up my core more. I'm currently back to about 225x8 belt less. This video is of me doing 225x5 and the form to me looks pretty crappy. If the angle is not right let me know and I can post another video  I may have, but I'm hoping some knowledgable lifters can weigh in on my form.

Before this I was running an olympic/powerlifting hybrid routine based around westside methods throughout high school to improve my shot put and discus performance.

I competed single ply with a wide squat in chucks as well as sumo deadlifting.  In terms of pure weight, these were my strongest stances raw or in gear.

Fast forward a few uneventful years and I'm trying to get back on track.  My strength is a bit lower then it was but I've been training the whole time, just add with my goals and stunting progress.  

A few months ago, my hips started to bother me while squatting, as well as a nagging adductor injury that seemed to pop up anytime I tried to add weight to my heavier sets.  I figured it was a form flaw and decided to swap to olympic style full squats, as well as conventional deadlifts (simply because of trying to rehab the hips a bit).

I'm at a point now where I want to compete again when my lifts are where I want them but am unsure if it would be powerlifting, strongman or both. Either way I would end up being raw.  Assuming injuries are no longer an issue, should I keep going with the conventional dl and olympic squat (where my sumo dl is 20-40 lbs stronger, and squat is probably closer) switch back to my ""strongest potential"" forms, do a mixture of both (sumo dl and olympic squat or conv dl with wide squat) or simply alternate each form and decide which to use when closing in on a potential competition( not ideal for running Sheiko or my own thoughts on conjugate vs competition lift focus)?

Gender: Male

Height: 5'8

Meet: Richmond Open at Atlee High School, Saturday April 6th. This is in a suburb of the city, I live in Richmond proper, its about 15 minutes away. 

Experience: I've been powerlifting for 7 years, but this is my first competition. Started lifting at 5'8 110, benching the bar, squatting/deadlifting a plate, gained about 30 pounds my first year, and 5 pounds a year thereafter til my current weight. I've played soccer the entire time, ranging from 5-6 times a week at the division 3 college level play, to right now I play once a week in a mens high-level rec league. Smoked from 19-21, quit three years ago.

Weight: Walk at 170, competing at 165. I know the general consensus in this forum is to not cut weight for your first competition, but I think I'm an exception because I'm much more experienced than your average first timer, and I really don't want to get bigger than I am now anyway because I love to play soccer and any more weight wouldn't play at the competitive level I do now. The last month, I usually go to bed at ~170, and wake up at ~166, so Ill be doing no sodium Thursday Friday, and no liquids whatsoever after 5PM friday. Ill drink 1+ gallon a day water Monady - Thursday. It's not the biggest deal if I don't make weight, but its something I'd like to do.

Occupation: Software Developer

GOALS: My first rep is going to be fairly comfortable, in the last week I've hit my openners each 5 times, one rep 5 sets, with 5 minutes between each rep. I think I'm fairly comfortable with them. 

My second attempt will be my current PR for all of the lifts, or close to it. I've hit these the last week of February. I'd be pretty satisfied if the day ended, and I go 6/9, even if I don't make weight.

My third attempt will be a new PR for all three lifts. I've altered it slightly, because I would like to set state records that are possible, and I'd rather go for a state record I have a 25% on, than 15 pounds less at 50%. I would be absolutely estatic if I hit 9/9, especially if I make weight.

FOOD ON DAY OF EVENT: As soon as weight ins are over, I'll have two hours before my squat openner. I'm bringing greek yogurt, Pedialyte, ill get some coffee in me, and I am bringing about two pounds of brown rice, and some of my home made pulled pork. Ill munch on this all day, a few bites every hour or so, but never enough to get super full. I'm also bringing 4-5 bottles of my homemade pre-workout drink, which is basically 5 hour energy(caffiene + vitamin b6) and creatine, which I make on my own for about 50 cents a bottle. I might not drink every one, but Im planning on having 3, one before each session.


Squat: Openner: 365. I'm pretty comfortable with this, ive done it many times in the gym, tripled it once, and gotten singles on it about 10 more times. Ive never failed with it, but theres been once or twice where I may have just hit parallel, as opposed to going a few inches below.

Second Attempt: 405 is my max ever, and felt pretty good the last week of February, so I'm gonna go for this on my second attempt. 90% confident I can get this.

Third Attempt: This is where things get tricky. This totally depends on how good 405 feels. If 405 feels great, I'm gonna jack this up alot. 200kg has been the goal for a while now, and 440 is where I think I could get. Id be 40% confident in this right now. If 405 felt terrible, but I get it, I might go for 420 or 415. If I dont make weight, the state record at 181 is 445, so I would attempt to tie it, and I would break it due to my(assumed) lower body weight. 

BENCH: Openner: 220(100kg) - This is my weakest lift. Ive improved tremendously in form + weight the last few months, but still have a lot of work to do on bench. I can comfortably hit 220 with a 0 second pause if I wanted to, so this feels about right for an openner.

Second: 235 - I hit 235 back in February. I stalled at lockout, and it probably took 3-4 seconds for e to get to lockout, but I got it. Ive improved somewhat since then, but not enough to justify going for more. If I had an option between 233 and 237, Id go 233.

Third - Totally depends on the 235. If it goes up, no problem, Id go for 245-250. If I struggle significantly, Id go low 240s. I think this lift is the one where Im going to improve the most the next few months, but Im not quite there yet.

Deadlift: Openner: 455 - I changed from conventional to sumo in November or so, and my deadlift has shot up from max of 405 to 495 since then. I can get 455 pretty comfortably.

Second: I might be exhausted at this point. Last week, I got 455x5 pretty comfotably with 5 minutes rest, and felt I woulda been pretty confident in 495. That was without maxing in squat/bench first though. If i feel great, Im going for 495/501. If I feel like crap, I might just go for 475.

Third: This totally depends on how Im feeling/if I make weight. The state record at 165 is 530. If 495 goes well, and Im under 165, and I feel good, Im going 535. The most Ive ever gotten is 195, so this is a big jump, but Id much rather go for 535 @ 25% chance than 515 with 60% chance. This is a personal goal of mine. Im gonna get this record, and Ive put myself in a position to get it next weekend with 7 years of hard work. If I dont make weight, the 530 is less of a goal. Id still go for it if 495 felt great, but I'd be more inclined to go for less.

Overall: First attempt: 1040

Second: 1135(again I'd be satisfied with this, regardless of weight, and dissapointed if I dont get it)

Third: 1210-1220 - Id be absolutely estatic for this, regardless of whether I hit weight or not.

Thanks for reading- and please provide any critique you possibly could, and advice for this and future meets. My next meet is on August 10th, the day after my 25th birthday, in new Brunswick, NJ. I hope to get 1250 at that meet.

1364523080.0,5,self.powerlifting,1b7uj5,Questions about Sheiko,6,1,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/powerlifting/comments/1b7uj5/questions_about_sheiko/,"Hi all, I compete for my high school powerlifting team (geared). During our 5 month season, we are pretty much always 4 weeks out from a meet. We use 5/3/1 and it works very well in our situation in that we build strength but also can prepare for a meet by using progressively heavier loads. However, I do not think I am advanced enough to run 5/3/1 in the offseason, where my only goal is to gain strength and being ready for competition is not an issue.

 I was asking my coach about offseason programming and he recommended [sheiko #29](http://www.beyondlimitstraining.net/news/5112-sheiko-29-the-beyond-limits-project). I have a few questions about it that he isn't quite sure of. 

1) **Would Sheiko be an effective program for a geared lifter?** I would do it raw because getting in and out of gear when training by myself is a hassle, but would try to have as much of my raw strength gains translate to my equipped strength. Some of the exercises, especially in the bench, seem like they would not have much carryover to gear. 

2) **Is it ok to change up some of the assistance work to target the muscles used in geared lifting?** For example, I would replace flies with a tricep-dominant movement like floor presses. I would also consider switching good mornings to abs, as my lower back is very strong and my abs are very weak. 

3) **If the answer to both of these are yes, am I advanced enough to run Sheiko?** I will have had about a year of experience with serious lifting by the time the season ends. I am 14, 6'0"", compete at a heavy 242, and my maxes in gear (with generous high school judging) are about 535/275/450. I am not making linear progress anymore, but pretty consistently see my numbers increase on a weekly basis.

4) **What other programs would you recommend?** I am also considering the Texas Method, but can't really think of any other suitable programs.

Any advice is appreciated. Thank you in advance!

				March 10th, 2013


**Stats**-Height 6'1, 19 years old
	Weighed in at 197.9lbs, competed in 198s (90kg), daily weight is 210 lbs(95kg).  


Definitely felt weaker after doing a quick water cut and after drinking 64oz of prune juice along my best friends advice (Although thinking back, I think that was more for his entertainment than for my benefit.).Will not do that again soon. Id rather compete strong and heavy than feel dehydrated and drained. Will learn from it.     
 
**Results**  
Squat-  
	1st attempt- 305lbs (142kg), three whites, easy weight to get on the board  
	2nd attempt- 355lbs (161kg), three whites, a 15 lb PR  
	3rd attempt- ~~375lbs (170kg)~~, failed lift, started to stall out and judges 
				     called for a rack. I could have had it but it would have been a
				     grinded lift and very slow.

Bench, my weakest event  
	1st attempt - 225lbs(102kg), 3 whites.
	2nd attempt - ~~250lbs(114kg)~~, failed, was hoping to match a training PR from two weeks 
				     prior,too slow going down and got stuck at the bottom  
	3rd attempt - ~~250lbs(114kg)~~, failed, went down smooth and quick, came up great but stalled at 
				     the height of my sticking spot, could have pushed it through, but judges called for a rack.   


Deadlift, my strongest and most comfortable event.No videos.  
	1st- 405lbs(184kg)- 3 whites  
	2nd- 455lbs(206kg)- 3 whites, Solid lift, 20 lb PR  
	3rd- ~~475lbs(211kg)~~- failed. Couldnt even get it off the ground.   


Total 
1035lbs(470kg),

**Overall**



Took first in my weight class, 3rd in the teen division. Happy with my squat and deadlift results, but there is always work to do. Need to work on bench consistency, got to work on that sticking point, form definitely needs some work as well.   Not bad for a first meet.  

I've been lifting for about seven months now, I was a swimmer for about ten years until the end of high school, and never really saw the inside of a gym. I picked up some dumbbells last March, at 5'10 and 138lbs, did mostly just bench and curls, the usual screw around stuff beginners do,but really got hooked around seven months ago.  


**Some Background**

I started seriously lifting in university,in September 2012, when I met my best friend and lifting partner, a former wrestler and high school weightlifter. He started to train me, and I improved quickly, soon able to match his best lifts. Granted, hes only 5'2 and barely 140 soaking wet, but it was an accomplishment to hit a 2 plate bench, 3 plate squat, and a 4 plate deadlift after only 5 months. 
	In January, we got kicked out of our school gym for being ""rough on the equipment"" and for ""disturbing other patrons""; we were doing deadlifts and power clean and jerks and I suspect they were just tired of hearing grunts and yells and the occasional loaded barbell being dropped to the ground. My friend and I decided to find our own gym.	We looked at Gold's , LA Fitness, 24hour Fitness and were totally turned off by some aspects of those gyms. The limited equipment, the ever-present ""No Deadlift"" rule, and the infamous 'Lunk Alarm' that I'm sure many of you are familiar with.... Anyways, we found a home.  


LionHeart Gym. Its a small gym, located in the back of a small printing business out in Pinellas County FL, and its the best gym around. It feels like it was pulled off the set of the Rocky movies, with low lighting, chalk covered concrete and carpeted floors, and an old-man ball sweat odor permeating the place. Its AMAZING. There are tons of iron plates, a squat rack, power cage, and 2 competition benches. Its usually empty of people, and the owner couldn't give a damn if weights are dropped or thrown around or if yelling occurs. Hell, he often contributes to the noise on bench day.  

 On our first day, we met three of his patrons, up and coming 308er Morgan Mann, (whom I shadow), and world record benchers Joey Scalzo (who my friend shadows) and Leon Barry, who are all training for the Europa Expo in Orlando in 6 weeks. They  welcomed us into their workout with open arms, and we have been training with them ever since. They have been a great influence and their expertise and support has been great in preparation for this meet. I have the utmost gratitude for those guys, for helping us train and for driving with us to the competition, where they helped with equipment and technique and inspiration. They really are the best. 

**Training**  
This meet wasn't really planned for. Our first day at LionHeart, we heard it mentioned during our first workout and decided to just go for it. We had roughly seven weeks to prepare, so we followed a tapering workout that looked liked this:

Monday-Squat and speed deadlift
Wednesday- Speed Bench and Upper Back
Friday- Deadlift
Sunday- Bench


6 weeks out - Triples to max
4,5 weeks out- Doubles to Max
3 weeks out, Singles to max
2 weeks out, Up to opening lift
Last week, rest.


**Diet**  
Ate pretty healthy, mostly university cafeteria food supplemented by eggs, chicken and milk, occasional 50 nugget bucket from Wendy's, triweekly trips to Chipotle and all you can eat wings at Winghouse every monday. Okay, perhaps not so healthy, but I tried to stay protein heavy but always ate my fruits and veggies. 

**Supplements**  
None. Multi and fish oil.   

**Future Training**
Bulking up to 220. Going to run Joey Scalzo's bench press routine ( a modified Russian routine shortened to 8 weeks) or do Smolov for squat. Not sure yet. Deadlifts should improve with squats.
My goal is to break the Florida state record as found [here](http://apa-wpa.com/APA%20Florida%20Mens%20Records.htm) by January 19th next year. Squat will have to improve from 355lbs(161kg) to 425lbs (193kg). Bench will have to go from &gt;225lbs(102kg) to 275lbs(125kg). Deadlift will have to go from 455lbs(206kg) to 550lbs(250kg). I know damn well that Im going to shatter it. 

Any advice or thoughts would be greatly appreciated!

I am a junior in high school and am in the powerlifting team. I found this subreddit and thought that it was an ideal place to learn. I love this sport and train myself. The coach puts up a ""workout"" and lets us go at it on our own. I want what everyone else wants, to get stronger faster. So a few questions: 

*Would it be recommended to take creatine, weight-loss supplements (hydroxycut), other?

*What is a good web page to learn a good work out or work outs?

*Tips for things to do before and at the meets

*Any other recommendations/tips that may come to mind.


Another thing on my to-do list is getting a 6 pack. I was an over weight kid back in the day and getting one has been a dream out of my reach no matter how much I try. Is it really all in the diet or could working out enough be sufficient? 

Also, I have to juggle time with DC and PAP classes, band practice(s) and powerlifting practices.

I realize that this is a dumb question, but just hear me out.

I've been getting into powerlifting a lot lately for the sheer strength that it can give me (and that I've never had). At this point, I'm 6'2"" and 155. I've been working with a trainer who's been putting me through great workouts that are building up my overall strength in all the lifts. Anyway, he's also been telling me to eat basically everything I see if I want to get big. The thing is, he's pretty fat (although he's an extremely strong competitive powerlifter), and I've noticed that many other powerlifters are what I would call ""fat"" (despite the fact that they're very strong).

As someone with an average body right now, the thought of getting too fat scares me a little, although I would put some on if it would help my powerlifting. That's why I'm coming to you now: are you as a powerlifter ""fat""? Is it OK? Should I be afraid of it if my goal is getting very strong and quite a bit larger?

 I am a male in my young 20's, 200lbs, around 10-12% body fat (haven't measured, its an educated guess) and have been lifting for 3 years. I have a history in sports and have held or still hold several American records in two sports along with a few gold medals in the Jr. Olympics. I started with SS and then went into a few other programs but for the last 8 months have just been lifting how I want since its been for enjoyment not progression. 

More general info:
With my lifestyle I normally sleep around 6 hours a night with 90% of the rest of my day working. I work sitting down mostly and nothing that would get my heart rate over 100 in an average day. I have done this for as long as I have been lifting but as I am down to the wire for the last few months and have 0 wiggle room, my stress levels have gone through the roof. Other then going grey (its happening already) I know that stress can have some funny effects on the body.  

The Question: 
Can stress have a large effect on your lifts. My lifts are down 20% across the board while my body weight hasn't changed a LB in a few months. Can mental fatigue (guessing that is what it is) have such a physical impact, even when the workout is done morning or night? While this will only continue for 3 more months, it would be good to know if there could be other factors which are draining me or if this is a common response. 

TL;DR: Worried that there is something more then just stress going on, figure some one may have some experience with it or studies which point to similar results. ",,False,,t5_2s4tp,False,,,True,t3_1knoqq,http://www.reddit.com/r/powerlifting/comments/1knoqq/how_much_can_stress_effect_your_lifts/,

So, I'm a beginning powerlifter, and I'm 23. I started lifting last September (at 6'2"" 163). I have been lifting almost continuously since then, and I have been gaining weight the entire time (at a rate of no more than one pound per week, most weeks; sometimes less, almost never more). I am now the same height, at 185. In the time since last September, my numbers have all gone up substantially (they are still not satisfying, since my first numbers were absolutely horrible, but I have made a huge amount of progress on each, and it is continuing steadily). I am planning on continuing just the way that I'm going now for a while, bulking and increasing my lifts steadily, as long as that steady progress lasts.

So, here's my dilemma. At 185 now, I have put on about 22 pounds already. I am much more muscular than I used to be (with specific positive comments on my back and my chest, and I can see the difference in my arms and legs). However, I have also put on some fat. I wouldn't say that it's really noticeable yet, but there will come a time soon enough when an average person might look at me and think of me as ""chubby"" or something similar. I can see sort of an offensive lineman physique developing. Anyway, I plan on getting much bigger--not for competition (although I am thinking about it), but out of my own personal desire to be a big guy. I was thinking of shooting for 225 ultimately, and maybe going bigger after that. I don't mind getting kinda soft, but I don't want to look terrible.

My question is this: at what point should I end my bulk? I was thinking of bulking to 200 and cutting, but I have heard some other ideas. A friend of mine, the president of the powerlifting club at our university, has suggested 210 before cutting (and explicitly told me not to cut right now). Another friend, who is kind of a meathead, suggested that I go to 250 in a single bulk and cut from there. That idea sounds a bit extreme, as I would probably be really fat at that point, but he did make the point about preserving strength.

Can you guys offer any advice?

tl;dr: newbie powerlifter on his first long bulk. How should I balance my initial steady strength gains with turning into a fatass?

Thanks for your help!

1. How do weight classes work? What's the cut-off point between two weight classes? I'm currently 140 lb., so what weight class would that put me in? If I wanted to cut weight, what weight would I need to drop to in order to make a lower weight class? Do I absolutely have to commit to a weight class when I register?

2. I currently only use a belt (no knee wraps, wrist wraps, bench shirt, etc). Would that place me in the ""Raw Classic"" division? What is the difference between Multi-Ply, Single-Ply, Raw Classic, and Raw Modern?

3. What lifting program would you do if you were 2 months out from a meet? I've been doing the 5/3/1 program, and have continued to make gains on it. I bought the Cube Method and have heard that it's set up to end with a meet.

I've been lifting in various capacities for about five years now. I've gone in spurts accoording to the amount of free time I have. I've always had to deal with some back pain but I've been careful and if I feel anything I back off, rest, ice/heat etc. 

About a year in I started using a belt and, like many people, found I was a more confident lifter with it on. I started wearing it pretty much every time I squatted or deadlifted. About two months ago I started getting fairly severe lower back pain and went to the doctor. I've got a minor fractured disk and nodules in my cartilage.

My question is did the belt hurt or help me? I always understood it to be a ""safety"" item but I've also heard that it can become a crutch as your body tends to develop around it. Can anybody shed some light on this?

I know it's not a ton of information and we're not doctors but I know some of us are knowledgeable. I'd like to get back to my former performance level and beyond but I'm not much good right now. I posted this in r/powerlifting because that's how I train. Also I should mention that the doctor said it appears to be an older injury, he said greater than six months ago.

I'm a high school sophomore, and this is my first year in powerlifting. I want to stay in my weight class (132's) in addition to losing some of my extra fat while gaining more muscle. Right now I hover around 127. I tried keto a while back and could never do it for more than a week. I lost some weight, but could barely do 60% of my maxes when I was on keto. Never tried paleo, and I don't really understand leangains (since I workout Mon-Fri at school, I don't know what my ""off"" days would be versus my ""lifting"" days since it should ideally be every other day on LG). 

I usually don't eat breakfast (always rushing in the morning) and usually don't eat lunch (gross cafeteria food, and too busy to bother with a sack lunch) so I eat after school (around 4-5pm) which basically follows the basic 16/8 leangains rule, but I just eat whatever I want to eat.

I rarely eat fast food. The only ""fast food"" I have frequently is Chipotle (bowl, brown rice, pinto, steak, sometimes tomatoes, and extra lettuce). I like cooking so I pretty much always make my own food.

Today I had grilled chicken breast, steamed broccoli, baked sweet potato fries, then a granola bar, and later a bit of mac and cheese (maybe 1/4 c.), and a bowl of cereal with unsw. almond milk and half a banana.

My current lifts: 220 squat, 255 deadlift, 140 bench.
I only lift with a belt.

My question is that many females seem to be 30-50 lbs above my lifts, however...I've seen that they use suits/shirts
 at times. Does this really make a difference for a lifter? If I were to be I'm a suit, would my lifts be significantly heavier?

Also, I'm curious about conventional and sumo. I seem to feel as if its more work (at least for me) to deadlift conventional. However, it seems like most people at my gym tend to go for sumo. Is this best for those that have stronger hips? I'm not really short for a female (5'6), so would I benefit from training sumo?

* **Squat**: 365 (high bar, no belt)
* **Bench**: 290
* **Deadlift**: 455 (with straps), highest I've tried without was 405, both with no belt

I have a belt on the way, but haven't extensively trained with one before. I would like to hope to be able to hit numbers like 300# bench, 400# squat, and 500# deadlift, but I don't know how unrealistic that is.

Also, I have to cute down to 148lbs by the day before the meet, but I'm thinking I might be able to do that in water weight alone? Does anyone know around how much (on average) one can drop through water weight?

I would like to switch my high bar squat to a low bar squat in the hopes of getting more power, in addition to utilizing my belt once it arrives. Anyone have any tips on either/both?

I attempted my first sumo deadlift the other day to see if it was better than my conventional, but I feel like I have less power off the floor. I don't know if it is because of my lack of technique, or lack of strength in that form. I don't know if it's worth trying to switch from conventional to sumo this close to the actual competition.

One more thing: I need to pick up a singlet for the competition and was wondering if there are any that are recommended. I also wanted to pick up a pair of wrist wraps and would like to know of any recommendations as far as those go as well.

Also, I'm currently looking for a singlet for my competition. I live in Southern California and was wondering if there was any retail stores around here that sell them. I'd rather pick one up in a store than purchase one online, but I can't seem to find any stores that even sell singlets... Any information regarding this would be greatly appreciated!

Lastly, any and all powerlifting meet advice would be greatly appreciated. If you can help me even an ounce in any of the previous questions, I would be stoked. Thank you!

**EDIT**: Here is a video of my bench form. I'm a little concerned that my butt comes too far off the bench during the more heavy lifts? What is the exact policy for USPA benching technique? I read that shoulders and buttocks cannot leave the bench, but there are a few videos where there butt comes off just a tad and they cleared the lift. Anyway, just looking for advice. Thanks!

Here's a vide of my squat form: http://youtu.be/RgkXsQOtqnI

Here's my deadlift. I really need some help with my deadlift. When I strap up, 405x3 isn't too difficult (http://youtu.be/pRPja9-909s), but when I chalk up and don't use gloves and straps, my back rounds ... and the grip isn't too big of an issue either as seen here: http://youtu.be/OiU6RV9ZxrE

The gym I train at (Olympic and powerlifts) does not use A/C.  The garage is open and there is a large fan.  On days it is humid, the fan does not help too much.  What are ways I could keep my body temperature from getting too high.

I have been given some suggestions, not all are feasible.. such as pouring ice cold water on my head at intervals.  Problem with that is having water drip on the floor and platform, and then having to keep my hands dry.  

Ice vest: I would rather not lift while I wear something weighted.

I thought about getting a plastic kiddie pool, and putting those flexible ice packs in it then laying it in every so often. lol

maybe hanging ice from the fan? I have no idea.  please let me know your suggestions and if you have been in the same situation, what you did that helped?

Some background: I am a 14 year old freshman and I compete in the JV division. I started lifting single-ply around the new year. I competed at 242, and weighed in at 235. The meet was completely unsanctioned and was more of a fundraiser for the host school, but had a pretty good turnout nonetheless. Eleven high school teams competed, and about 170 lifters were involved. 

**Squat:**

Warmups: Pretty standard. First we stretched and did some dynamic warmups and then hit 8 or so sets, progressively implementing more gear and ending with a 395 suited and wrapped single. 

Attempts:

430

460

495

My coach insists on not telling us what our third attempts are, and it's hard to judge, as collar weights and bar weights vary from meet to meet. I thought I had squatted 480 on my third! It was great to hear that I had exceeded that mark.

**Bench:**

Warmups: Similar in structure to squats. Shoulder warmup, some raw sets, some shirted 2-board doubles. 

Attempts:

225

~~245~~

~~245~~

Very disappointing. I hit 240 fairly easily in a meet last month, and was hoping for 255 today. 225 felt very good, but the second and third attempts were inexplicably bad. I don't really know what happened, especially considering that I know I've been making progress in the gym on board presses, band benches, and general tricep strength, which is my biggest weakness. We haven't done shirted benches off the chest since our last meet, which may have something to do with it. Ah well, I'll get em next time.

**Deadlift:**

Warmups: I decided to only do 3 warmup sets: 135x3, 225x2, and 315x1. Our coaches suggest 8 warmups for deads, but I think that is far too many. At my first meet back in December, a raw one that I entered on my own, I did my warmup method and ended up pulling a 20lb PR of 425 (I don't mean to sound superior, but it happens to work better for me). 

Attempts:

385

400

420

All three attempts felt pretty solid, with 420 being a definite struggle, but not to the extent of toying with a herniated disc or anything like that. I lifted raw, but my coach has told me that we have a deadlift suit for me that would work for conventional. Unfortunately there was not enough time to train in it.

**Results:** 

I totaled 1140 and got 2nd place in JV 242 out of 7 lifters, 5 of them sophomores. It was an unusually strong class for us. My training partner, a sophomore, took 1st with 1220, and my freshman buddy took 4th with 955, which was a huge improvement from his last meet. Being a team event, teams were awarded points from placing in classes. I believe we scored 52 points, with a good chunk of those coming from my class. Although I was slightly disappointed with my effort, our school did really well. I am proud to say that we took 2nd place in the competition. First went to a reform school for young men that amassed a whopping 132 points. They were amazing!

Highlights: 
 
* SHW **FRESHMAN** totaled 1570 (he was from the reform school). 
* Senior 148er from our school totaled 1130, breaking his own school record in the deadlift with 450.
* The people that ran the meet not understanding the Wilks formula and giving the best lifter awards based on total/bodyweight...123er with 815 won JV &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;

Overall it was a good experience, and the competition was surprisingly close. No one team was completely outclassed, excluding the reform school. I am looking forward to my next meet, USAPL HS Nationals in April, where I hope to total 1200 with some more elaborate peaking and a new DL suit. Thanks for reading!

I'm sitting at about 17-20% bf right now after a dirty bulk gone on way too long. I switched to powerlifting from bodybuilding about 6 months ago (hence the bulk continued). My lifts are going up considerable and are pretty competitive for what my original weightclass (181) would be. I'm wondering if its possible or pheasable to cut back down to 180's from 230 while still progressing fairly linearly in strength.

I'm gonna try and just use a leangains approach -10% TDEE on training days and -20% on rest days in order to try and keep my recovery up as much as possible. 

Has anyone had experience with this and not stalled out horribly bad? Should I just try and eat -10% of maintenance for a long time and dwindle down slowly while getting stronger?

Lift stats are unimpressive for my current weight

I had my first ever competition today and thought I'd do a write-up (more for my benefit than yours!). I've been lifting since Feb this year; bulked a lot until about 2 months ago (got to around 117kg, super-high body fat and bloated) and my PRs from then are 190kg squat, 127.5kg bench, 235kg deadlift (unofficial).

I got sick of that and decided to cut; weighed in this morning at 100.9kg, which I was pretty happy with. However, I'm not lifting anywhere near what I was before, which kinda sucks.

---

**The Meet**

The Gym Challenge was just a novice competition for people who hadn't really tried powerlifting before. I entered with another guy and his girlfriend from my gym, and there were 2 other competitors there - one who's going to the World Masters games in a few weeks, and another guy from a different gym who was also just having a go.

---

**Squat:** 

150kg

~~155kg~~

155kg

We didn't get much time to warm up, which was a bit different from training. I had three attempts - first at 150kg which felt a bit heavy, so I went to 155kg. I would have got this attempt but I bumped in to one of the spotters and stumbled, got 3 red flags for that. Tried it again and it went up fine.

**Bench:**

~~105kg~~

115kg

~~117.5kg~~

I forgot about the ""start"" call on the 105kg, but it went up pretty easily so they let me go up to 115. 115 was hard, 117.5 couldn't get it above my chest. Hurt my shoulder a bit, which I'm icing as I type this.

**Deadlift:**

190kg

~~200kg~~

200kg

This was pretty hard because the floor was uneven below the bar. I got 190 up fine, then stumbled on the 200 attempt (I've never stumbled on a squat or deadlift before today!) even though I got it to almost lockout. I should have gone higher for my third but kept it at 200, which was piss easy the second time.

---

Overall I'm happy with my cut, but not so much with my lifts. However, the coaches at the gym were pretty impressed with all of us, and I might start training there if they're not too expensive! 

I was considering cutting to 95kg and competing at 93kg class, but one of the coaches said I'd probably do better at 105kg; I'm torn now between continuing my cut or switching to a lean bulk to stay around 105.

T-bar and chest-supported just feel so awkward to me, I hate any movement that isn't totally unconstrained. My favorite are probably DB/Kroc rows, but I still far prefer pullups over them.

We started our preparation for this meet immediately after the USPA Rocky Mountain Regional in August.

My preparation for the meet involved acknowledging my inner HAES (moving from the 242 class to the 275's) and following Tim Henriques' deadlift program in the hopes of getting my 540 competition pull up to 600. I followed the program pretty much to the letter, except I didn't do the long eccentric on the deficit deadlifts. I also included an extra ME squat day each week where I'd work up to a 1-3rm, then do speed squats with chains for doubles or triples until I felt like stopping. Bench work was done mostly by feel so as to not aggravate my shoulder. I made an attempt at running Smolov Jr. at one point, abandoning it after a week and a half when my biceps tendons blew up. The volume greatly improved my form and confidence, though, so it wasn't a total bust. After that, I benched twice a week working up to a 3rm one day, 3x5 the other day, both followed by incline work varying the grip for chest or triceps depending on how I felt.

As Thanksgiving rolled around, I bloated up to 278 pounds and began my deload in earnest, feeling that I was in a good place to weigh in a couple hours before lifting (I couldn't weigh in the night before, as I had to work Thursday and couldn't make the drive fast enough to hit the evening weigh-ins). A couple hours out from Vegas, Steve Denison (meet director and federation chair) calls me and tells me to haul butt in there so he doesn't have to get up early to weigh me and inspect my gear. We check into the hotel around 10:30 and I head down to the ballroom to meet the scale. I came in at 266, demonstrating my utter ineptitude at bloating.

Anyway, I went up to my room, downed half a gallon of gatorade and like 30 grams of creatine (because I fear weakness more than diarrhea) before attempting to sleep. 2 reds on that attempt. Get up at 8, consume 4 grams of choline (because the diarrhea had yet to rear its watery head) and mix another 10 grams with my gatorade. Breakfast consisted of 8 or 9 star crunches, a 5 hour energy shot, and a bronkaid, leaving me plenty of time to get to the ballroom to warm up at 8:30. (Insert description of massive pre-squat dump.)


**Squat**

Warm up went as follows.

* Rumble roller, fire hydrants, hip flexor stretches, jumps

* Stare at all the monsters and wonder how badly I'm going to get crushed

* Stand awkwardly next to the ER Rack and wonder how to adjust the rack height

* Make friends with a kid from Hawaii who knows how to adjust the rack and start squatting

* 135x6ish, 225x4ish, 315x2?, 415x1 (I wasn't really counting)

My opening attempt on squats was 425. Easy weight, but I felt super jittery and almost lost my balance when locking it out. 2 whites, probably because one of my feet may have shifted slightly. Whatever.

Next was 474, matching my gym PR. When I did this weight in the gym a few weeks back, it was a grinder from hell. Today it felt easier than my first attempt and came up crazy fast. 3 whites.

Last squat was 500 for a big PR and 25 pounds more than I've ever attempted. It felt light and moved fast, but I must have gotten spooked and cut it high. Strange, because I don't typically get any rebound until I'm past parallel. Still trying to figure that one out. 2 reds and the first time I've missed a competition lift due to depth.

My brother was in the next flight and went 3 for 3, ending up with a 567 squat.

**Bench**

Bench warmups were next. I honestly don't remember what I did here aside from popping another bronkaid and washing it down with another 5 hour energy. Might have eaten a sandwich at some point. I do remember that my shoulder was feeling good, but that doesn't mean much when dealing with nerve damage and you can't feel pain until it gets really bad...

Bench opener was 257 for an easy 3 whites. Second attempt was 286 for a 45 pound meet PR. Smoked it and called for 308. Got the weight a couple inches off my chest after playing a couple rounds of Civ IV as I waited for the press command. Shoulder said nope! and shut down. No pain, but I couldn't flare my elbows and it felt like I was trying to press the bar through a brick wall. 3 reds and a long break before the deadlift.

My brother went 3 for 3 again in the next flight and broke a long-standing barrier with a 352 bench.

**Deadlift**

Deadlift warmups involved refreshing myself in a bath of liniment, downing another energy shot/bronkaid, and working up to 415 for a single. Possible sandwich.

Opening deadlift was 507. Dang thing flew up and about knocked me over. 2 whites because my right sock wasn't pulled up as high as my left.

Next pull was 573 for a 33 pound meet PR. Came up easier than the first, since I didn't have to fight to keep the weight down. With this weight I broke through to a 1300+ total and hit one of my major goals for the meet.

I called for 601 for my last lift of the meet and a huge PR. This attempt was the culmination of all my work since August and a weight I wanted to hit before the end of the year. It came up, feeling no heavier than the previous lift for 3 whites. It's entirely possible that I had more in me, but I'm happier with a successful 600 lbs pull than a failed 620 pull. This lift also bumped my total up to 1361 and classified me as a Class I powerlifter, so I'm quite pleased with it.

My brother finished the meet 9 for 9 and pulling 650 for a 1569 total in the 308's. We each ended up taking 3rd in our weight classes and we hope to return to the Rocky Mountain Regionals next year.

That kid from Hawaii took 2nd in my weight class with a stupidly high squat and bench. Shawn Bellon spanked us both, then impressed us with his iconic gentlemanly nature. I can honestly say that I've never competed with finer men.

All in all, I'm very satisfied with this meet. I hit most of my goals and know that I'm capable of more. The judging was fair and consistent (except maybe for that sock thing) and the meet went smooth and fast. Props to Steve Denison for running a tight ship.

Other highlights:

* Hanging out between attempts, I found myself near Shawn. “Does standing next to you make me stronger?” I asked. “Yes, but only because I stand next to my wife.” Class.

* Sitting directly behind the right side judge when Chad Smith dropped his 837 pound squat attempt. Had a really good view of that mess. Not sure why there was only one scrawny spotter on each side, but thankfully no one was seriously hurt. Sucked to see him bomb out. I was really looking forward to seeing him total 2300 raw.

* No diarrhea.


TL;DR- Totaled 1361, didn't crap my pants.

I've been powerlifting since I was 12. I have a few records for bench press and always lifted/competed raw, with exception to using a belt on max lifts.
I got more into doing squat and dead lift about 6 years ago and love it. The instances I've seen people use lifting shoes were these:

* my buddy who competed in USAPL, uses them only when lifting really really heavy in the gym, or competing.

* these guys who have never done a sanctioned competition and use them to train and for strongman practices (but again, have never done sanctioned competitions for powerlifting or anything above a state level strongman competition).

I'm not a powerlifter myself, but I found this subreddit and decided to post here for advice.  Let me explain my story, or rather my friend's story.

A friend of mine from high school a few years ago was a pretty good football player on the high school team.  He didn't make any college teams, but he wasn't bothered by this, and he wanted to stay athletic, so he looked for something new.  He found powerlifting after he went to college.  We went to colleges on different ends of the country, and I went without seeing him for a while.  

After three years, I finally saw him in person again.  In three years of powerlifting, he had gotten absolutely huge.  He acquired both huge muscles and a large stomach.  I would say that he weighed around 210 (at 6'0"") when we graduated high school; now he weighs 295, I think he said, at the same height.  I commented on the muscles he has, and he brought me to his gym for a powerlifting demonstration, where he made it clear that he is now an awesomely strong beast.  It's just odd, though, because for all of his strength, I would describe him as ""fat.""  I don't want to bring it up with my friend, though, because I don't want to be a jerk.  

Anyway, is getting fat for powerlifting a normal thing?  What purpose would it serve?  Should I maybe try to talk my friend out of being so big around the middle?
