Now, LTE speeds are great and many apps have matured, but even unlimited data isn't unlimited. I thought the app developer answer to data caps would be local caching everywhere.

But it's still relatively rare. the HypeMachine app, Youtube apps, etc - are still data hungry. Video is the biggest deal - why not let me queue up a bunch of videos (from any non-flash site) and download them to the app cache?

I like Chrome on the Mac.

I'm not sure about Chrome for iOS.  I know it's not quite as fast due to AppStore limitations.  That aside, here are my pros and cons:

**Pro's:**
-tab system is great
-looks cool
-search in URL box
-tab sync via cloud *(I know Safari does this too now, though I don't like the way iCloud tabs are hidden in the bookmarks on the iPhone [it's fine on the Mac and iPad]*)

**Cons:**

It does not affect my wired connections, so it doesn't cut-off my internet completely. I have tried this out elsewhere and I can stream fine, so it is only my internet that trips them up.

Small intro,

I am project lead on a web app. The project is nearing to the and and CEO decided that he wants an phone app as well (never mind the fact that we pushed this since beginning, but I digress) in particular an iOS app. We have very short time before release (couple of months) 

I am pushing the solution where we should hire an agency, or experienced contractor who will do this for us.  However, our newly hired business manager is pushing a person he used to work with. He used to push this guy since beginning (few weeks ago), he apparently knows ruby php,  python , css, jquery, you name it.  Young lad in his early 20s. 

When we decided we want the app, the business manager jumped in and said that this guy can do this for us. When I asked - does he know iOS development. 'Oh yeah he knows everything""

I am all for supporting previous colleagues, and hiring juniors willing to learn, as well as  promoting young protégées but I am sincerely doubtful, that a person at his age is experienced at every single thing that I mention, yet still ""currently not busy"" . On same token - I am aware that good nad passionate programmers will pick up any language, given time. But that's not the point - we need someone who  knows the code already and will do his job professionally as we need the app in short time;  not someone who will spend time google coding. I can find dozen of people (including myslef and my team members) who can do that.

Cut the long story short,  I decided to give this guy  benefit of doubt and to do the interview with him.

My knowledge of iOS app development is very limited. So,  what questions should I ask an novice  iOS developer that has done at least something? . Or rather what is a fundamental thing every iOS developer that has ever done anything close to iOS development  has to know? (i.e. Activity Life cycle in Android,  data sanitization in web development, etc)

Is it unreasonable for example, to ask about how Apples push notifications work? etc..

Thanks.

My name is Dani and I'm an indie game developer and computer science student.

For the past 6 months I have been working on a mobile puzzle game called Roll With It! I was hoping for the game to make a bit of revenue for me to be able to afford my next year's tuition.

After a lot of work in order to make the most out of the game, it was released last week. Unfortunately it didn't got much attention and thus didn't match up to my expectations.

I'm afraid that if it keeps not selling I will have to suspend my academic education and find a job since I won't be able to sustain it. And this is where I need your help - spread the word about my game! Try out the demo, buy it if you like, and most importantly, tell the world about it.

I love being a game developer and I believe this can be a great jump start into the gaming industry. If you support indie games, and you want to see more of them coming, it should be in your interests to support indie developers.

I already have big plans for my next game and I'm sure all of you will love it, but to make it real, I just can't fail right now.

Please help me make this game a success... It doesn't have to be a big one. Just enough to keep me going.

Right now I see my options as: 

* Typing it in manually.
* Using an external card reader (Headphone Jack)
* Using the camera. (Not ideal)

While you're reading you can tap a word and get a pop-up definition or translation (currently supporting Swedish, French, German, Spanish, and Arabic). The context-sensitivity of the definitions is what separates this from automated definition translation technologies, in that this is actually accurate. The reason it's called Flikkt is because while reading in the app you can save words you're trying to learn to your personal dictionary (called a Flikktionary) by flicking them downwards. Here, you can review them and use them in word games etc.  

We have a similar web-based service through our website where you can read on your desktop/laptop. Currently, the front-page of the website shows how the thing works, here you hover with your mouse instead of tap with your to get the definition/translation.  

We have released a few books for English language-learners, and are working on more!

I've been working for the past two and a half months on my first personal App and want to see what you guys think about it.

You can download lots of free music online, especially if you know the right sites. It lets you do things like play and shuffle multiple playlists, or play songs using a particular song first and shuffling the rest, and more. It's better than the iPod music player for managing playlists and organizing your music on your device.

I know that filenames like that are plist files but why does it have it's own entry when it's not an app and why is it so huge?

And I have another question since I'm here anyway, my iPhone downloaded the 6.1 update OTA but was going to do it via iTunes to be safe. Will the OTA be included in my backup? Also, iTunes is not reflecting the same usage as what the iPhone is reporting. Is this normal?

There are ways to not have to spend money, but for the average iOS gamer, I have noticed a huge backlash on recent game releases, that are free but may require more payment through gameplay. 

I would personally, rather pay $2.99 or so for a totally unlocked game that has all the features available, eventually. I have downloaded a few games that were freemium, and I haven't had to spend money. 
Kids are a huge concern with these games because the may be too young, to understand what they did, or just not care.

But why, when I've dealt with the notifications on one device, do I have to go onto the other device to clear them too???

Is there any way that notifications can be synchronised across devices, via the cloud? And app badges too, so that when I read my messages or whatever, the app can inform the same app on my other device and clear the badge and the notifications?

Is this possible? Maybe on a jailbroken device?

What I'm looking is super common. For example, if I want to have a sprite nod up and down, or clap its hands, I should be able to do that right? Is animation not the right term for it? If so, what is? I'd really like to be able to understand that kind of stuff.

On my iPad2 iOS 5.0.1:

I am currently NOT logged into any account for iMessage. When I try to activate the service, I am asked to log into my Apple ID using an old email address (I recently updated my Apple ID to use a different email address; it is still the same account). Everything else (iCloud, FaceTime, Music, Video, Store) is using the new email address. Only iMessage is still prompting me with the old email address. I have tried resetting via Settings/General/Reset/Reset All Settings, but the old email address is still there under iMessage.
 ­  
 ­  
On my iPhone4S iOS 6.0:

It is similar story. iCloud is the one that's stuck on my old email address and the Apple ID field is greyed out so I can't log out of it to log in with the new email address. Everything else is using the new email address.

Does anyone have any idea how to resolve this issue? Thank you.

Update: Thanks for taking the time to reply, guys :) Sadly, repeatedly entering the password (it's still the same password but it doesn't work for the old email address) doesn't let me eventually change the username/email address, and I can't log in at all with the old email address even though the password's still the same :(. The Reset All Settings step was a bad move; it didn't help and now my iPad is stuck in Safe Mode and I can't get into the jailbroken state.

I really need some help with a program I want to implement on iOS. I am not much of a developer/coder, but just need to know if it's feasible before I pursue and get someone who actually knows what they're doing. I was hoping someone could help me. 

What I want to do is some object recognition using the back camera. Essentially I just need to theshold an image from a camera feed, extract blobs, calculate centroids, and perform a bit of calculation with those centroids and display over the camera images (the calculation is a bit of an iterative optimization but I'm assuming the image part takes more processing). All I'm looking for is to see if it's possible to do this at around 15 fps or better. Assuming I can get the camera feed at the 1920x1080 resolution, would looping through that kind of resolution be too much to get that kind real-time speed?

I live in an area without high speed internet, so although I do have a home network (GigE and 802.11n) it is not internet connected. 

Now I talked to a DirecTV rep and he said all this is possible, but he couldn't tell me how and he didn't understand that a network could exist that wasn't connected to the internet so I don't have much confidence in what he said.

Can anyone with a similar setup tell me how well this works?

Some questions he couldn't answer for me…

Does it require internet access? He says I don't need to dedicate a receiver to the streaming function so I'm concerned it wants to stream it all from DirecTV's servers.

If it does stream from something in my house, how many devices can watch simultaneously? Can I watch CNN downstairs on my PC while my GF watches Animal Planet on her iPad and the main TV records the latest Game of Thrones? There has to be a limiting factor somewhere right?

Having out of date photos wouldn't be so horrible. But instead what's now happened is; the WRONG photos are displaying everywhere. The lines got crossed and now when my Mother calls, I see my buddy Dave. When my Girlfriend calls, I see MY DAD! WORST! 

The old version of the Facebook App (the old HTML5 one) had an option to UNSYNC photos that would strip the photos our of contacts for me. But without that option, it looks like I'll be forced to strip the photos out and replace them manually.

It's free to download and play, so we're looking for all the feedback we can get! We want to make this thing the next Draw Something.

It's a turn-based ad-lib contest through a storyline that you play with friends and family to see who can continue and complete the best original story.  It's basically like Draw Something meets Words with Friends meets Mad-Libs.

You choose from more than 75 starter sentences that will help you write killer adventure, comedy, horror, romance or fantasy stories and earn virtual currency for buying bonus words and being more creative than your opponent. You can share each turn of your story on Facebook and Twitter, or by text. You can play random players through Facebook, which stays anonymous and enables a huge network of friendly opponents to play against. There will be more ways to login in an upcoming update. Considering Gmail or Game Center - let us know what you think about that.

We are really looking for feedback and will be sure and post updates as Stories Together progresses. If you like it, let us know. If you don't, also let us know.

Is there any way, from my iPhone or iPad, to move a contact from Yahoo to iCloud??? There doesn't appear to be a way to do this.

Or maybe there's a better way of achieving what I want? Here's exactly what I'm trying to do:

I use Yahoo as my primary account for storing contact details. I like it this way, because it means I have access to all my contacts from the Yahoo Mail website when I'm not on my iPhone/iPad, and it also synchronises with iOS in near enough real time.

In my job, I often meet people with whom I need to stay in contact for a couple of months. After this, I don't need them cluttering up my contacts list, but I don't want to delete their details.

So what I'd like to do is create contacts in Yahoo (using that as my default contacts account on my iOS devices). Then, after I no longer need to contact someone regularly, move their contact details out of Yahoo and into iCloud. I can then switch iCloud on/off as I need in my Contacts - off normally, but on only on the rare occasions when I need to dig out one of my old contacts.

Does anyone know how to do this? Thank you!",,False,,t5_2ru5b,False,,,True,t3_1e8ejo,http://www.reddit.com/r/ios/comments/1e8ejo/any_way_to_move_a_contact_from_one_groupaccount/,

   So my wife is growing frustrated that all the pictures we've got are stored away on hard drives connected to our desktop computer. Photo albums were a big deal to her family and they still make a big fuss about sharing photos whenever we are together. They swap HD cards and copy each others pictures at the end of every visit. As a result, we've got over 100 gigs of photos that my wife really wants access to someplace other than my office.

So what's the best way to turn her new ipad mini into a photo viewer? I imagine paying for iCloud might be an option, but then she's restricted to sharing when she's got an Internet connection. I tried buying a camera connection kit, but iPhoto on the ipad only allows you to view thumbnails from an external source. And I imagine we would max out the storage on free photo services like Flickr. 

So are there any apps out there that let you view photos from an external source in full screen on your iOS device? That way my wife could create albums she wanted to share on a an HD card and then just plug it in and show them off. It's like bringing a photo album with you, without having to haul a book around.

Before I start, let me say this- the auto scrolling of text as it is read aloud is a very nice feature. It is something I didn't realize would be nice to have until I had it. Big kudos to Apple for this.

Ok, so maybe this is just a weird thing that I am seeing, or maybe it's a bug. I don't know, but hopefully someone knows how to fix it:

In iOS 5, I was able to select whole blocks of text in Safari pretty easily. Ditto for whole pages of text. (Tap and hold to select a paragraph, tap and hold next to the block of text and slide your finger just a little bit to get the entire page. The whole process took less than 5 seconds on days that my fingers were not super shaky.) Next, I tap ""Speak"" to have the text read aloud to me. I absolutely loved this feature and use it nearly every day. Sure the ""voice"" was a little robot-y, but it was still way better than anything else I knew of.

Enter iOS 6, with new frustrations in tow. Now, selecting a block of text is still possible, but seems to be laggy. Forget about selecting whole pages, unless I want to do it one paragraph at a time. If I do manage to get the whole page selected, the experience that awaits after tapping ""Speak"" only inspires more grumbles. Sure, the text will be read aloud, but the voice is somehow degraded (maybe ""raspy and muffled"" is a better description). Worse yet, it seems like the length of pauses between paragraphs grows as more paragraphs are read. It gets to the point that you wonder if the end of the text has been reached.

Trying to scroll up or down the page after speech has started is useless, as Safari seems to be too busy reading to be able to handle scrolling. The only way I have been able to take back control is to back out of Safari to the home screen, them go back in, only to have to experience the whole ordeal from the beginning.

Has anyone else noticed this? Were you able to fix it? It is casting a dark cloud on what would otherwise be a really great iOS 6 experience for me.

Also- I've confirmed that the weird voice is also present when selecting text-""Speak"" in other apps.

I'm coming from a linux background, and I find the built-in terminal program on the mac lacking in comparison to gnome-terminal. Maybe I'm just used to gnome-terminal. In any case, what really annoys me is when I have two terms open and I want to copy a path from one to the other.

In gnome terminal, I would execute ""pwd"" then double click on the output. This would select and copy just the text on that line NOT including the newline, then I could middle click in the other terminal to paste. 

On the mac, I need to triple click on it- once to get the focus and then twice to select it INCLUDING the newline, which I do not want. Then I need to command-C, then click in the other window, then command-V. Because it includes the newline, its as if I hit enter, so it has to be the last thing in the command. otherwise, I need to hit the up arrow and edit. This is a *whole* *lot* more work for something I do many times a day. 

Speaking of command line editing, maybe I just need to configure something in my .bash_profile - but on linux, I can control-left or control-right to skip words on the command line. Why can't I do that on the mac?

So if I put up a news worthy photo that the NYT likes, a candid running photo that Runner's World magazine wants, or a photo of the Golden Gate Bridge for someone's personal blog page, they can all be easily licensed to an interested party.

There's also an assignments portion of the app where anyone can put up an assignment, give a short description, and also give what sort of compensation that they're willing to offer. There's endless possibilities here too. 

Overall, this just streamlines and simplifies a process that really needs some fixing. There isn't anything else out there doing this.

I am an iOS developer with a number of published Apps to my name.  I recently applied to a respected software company, who asked me to write a test App according to a simple spec:

---

Given the XML at the following address: 

[http://chrishatton.org/Data.xml]

Write an iPhone app that: 

+ Has a root and a detail view controller. 
+ Displays the first name, last name, age, sex and photo of each one of the contacts in one cell of a table view, on the root view controller 
+ When each contact's table view cell is tapped, directs the user to the detail view controller where the photo and the notes of that contact get displayed. 
+ Uses ARC \(Automatic Reference Counting\) 
+ Uses Asynchronous URL connections. 
+ Has the deployment target of iOS 5.0 

Make sure that your app: 

+ Doesn't use any third part library/classes.
+ Doesn't leak memory. 
+ Doesn't block the main thread when performing downloading operations. 
+ Reuses table view cells.

I don't know what is so wrong with my code; it follows the spec, passes static analysis and checks out for no memory leaks.

I figured this was as simple of backing up the first device and restoring that file to the second.  This accomplished nothing as far as I could tell.  No information, music or playlists were transferred.  The only change I found was it now was labeled in Itunes the same way.

I have virtually no experience with apple products and I figured this would be a simple task.  After a bunch of messing around with a plethora of third party software I finally found a program called CopyTrans that allowed me to copy of all the music on the first Ipod to my hard drive and then import into my Itunes library and however the playlists are still only one device.

I can export the playlists (1 by 1) into Itunes but those playlists seem to have no information at all on them.  He has roughly 200 playlists and rebuilding these one by one seems like a lot of work.  This frustrated me to no end and seemed like a common, reasonable and simple request.  Apparently it was uncommon, unreasonable, and difficult to the point I have given up entirely.  

I fear for people who trust Itunes to actually backup any of their information.  Other than the name of the Ipod no information was stored in this backup.  None of the official Apple software is capable copying this information from Ipod to another Ipod.  And most of the 3rd party software claimed it would and never worked.

This is my first post and my first app. I've been gradually working on developing an app for my ROTC program on campus and I have no previous experience with xcode or coding. 

With that said, many of you will probably hate me for this, but I'm also developing on a dell inspiron that is running 10.6.8 and am using storyboard. Starting off I didn't have the money to buy a Apple computer and I have an HP laptop. Since I've started this project in January we have been approved from our superiors to buy an iMAC that I'll be using to develop the rest of the app.

My problem is that when I first started creating this app, organization was not a priority and I was just designing controllers and linking the buttons together through storyboard. Now that I have most of it complete and am trying to add some more complicated things in the app, I try to follow the directions and can't follow them.

For example, in storyboard, I design a controller with a button that I want to open a link. Then I open the section view of FirstViewController.h and try to drag it over to link it to code and it won't let me drop it anywhere... sorry for the lack of technical terms.

Thanks in advance for any help.",,False,,t5_2ru5b,False,,,True,t3_sp6fd,http://www.reddit.com/r/ios/comments/sp6fd/help_with_ibaction/,

So the situation is as follows: 

I don't have access to my Recovery Key and Apple removed the last of my trusted devices. I've spoke with Apple Care multiple times, but they just cite whatever is on their help page and i really can't just forget about this account and make a new one. Is there something i can do?

UPDATE: Clarification about my intentions.

Why you had only iPhone as trusted device?

* Because i only had iPhone as an Apple device, and Apple does not support SMS verification in my country.

Do you actually own this account?

* Yes, i have Developer account on it, i have a Credit Card, ID with which i can prove that this account is in fact my own. I have my password and everything is working correctly, apart from the fact  that i can't manage my AppleID.

Why do you want to know the recovery key content?

* Because i want to know what i'm looking for, i was looking for RK-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX written on a piece of paper, but i've read somewhere that this is 14digit code.

Am i after something malicious here?

* No, honestly i just want to get back my account. According to Apple i have to create a new one and the Developer Access (for which i paid) is not transferable, thus i have to pay again. And every purchase made from this account (apps, music, movies) is non-transferable.

How come you didn't changed your key while you had your iPhone trusted?

* I didn't know i've lost it, until i had to enter it.

What do you hope to achieve with this topic?

* I hope that someone that went through something like this, can tell me if there is a way for Apple to do something. Like Fax them my ID/CC or something else. In general i just want an advice on what can i do in this situation.

So what do you want, someone to give you your key?

* No, i'm perfectly aware that if i don't find this key, no one can give it to me.",,False,,t5_2ru5b,1376138293.0,,,True,t3_1k1193,http://www.reddit.com/r/ios/comments/1k1193/lost_my_recovery_key_any_advices/,

I'm a physio and one of the things we do with our diagnosis is use a series of 14 flowcharts to lead us to our diagnosis. Its actually very laborious but for insurance purposes its a necessity. 

The way the algorithm works you basically do a test and it can be answered one of 4 ways. That leads you to the next box. Eventually you are at a terminal box and it says ""success go do this, now do the next flowchart."" Its a process of putting a systematic approach to physical diagnosis. Anyway we do it on paper and its slow as hell, but was curious if there's an app out there that lets me make an ipad questionaire basically or a way to do it somehow so I can quickly fill it out and it lead me through.

So in the example below if the answer is FN, then I don't care about the test on the left, only the one on the right. My wife was googling and she thought she saw something called [B]Skip Logic [/B]that is 'almost' what we are looking for? 

Here to ask the smart people because I don't have a clue, but it can't be THAT hard to find something like this I just don't know where to look.

We used MobileMe first and switched to iCloud when it was launched. Calendar sharing enables us to see each other’s schedule at a glance, which enabled us to simplify the planning of things ahead.

To my best knowledge, iOS cannot differentiate between your personal calendars and personal calendars of other people that are being shared with you via iCloud. Since the launch of iOS 5, which brought Siri and Notification Center, our above described calendar sharing arrangement has become less ideal. In some instances it has even become an annoyance. Siri will also state my wife’s appointments when I ask her about my schedule for tomorrow. The same thing goes for Notification Center, which shows not only my own appointments but those of my wife as well. This is annoying, especially if we both have a busy day scheduled.

Does anyone know a way to make iOS aware of which calendars are mine and which ones are not? Or maybe there is a way to tell iOS/Siri/Notification Center to simply ignore certain calendars?

I have started to look for a solution because I foresee this becoming an even bigger problem when iOS 7 comes out later this year, since it supports features similar to Google Now (tells you the traffic conditions to your next appointment, weather, etc.)

I'm enjoying all the posts about iOS7. I'm getting pretty stoked on the release!

I found that Parallax actually does work on iPhone4, but not to the extent like it does on later phones.

Here's how you get it to work:

1. Download a Panoramic image from somewhere on the web.  Here's a good one to use: http://digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/sunset-cliffs-panorama.jpg

1. Save it to your camera roll

1. Now go into settings and change you background image.  When selecting your image, under the ""Photos"" section there will be a folder called ""Panoramas"".  The image you just downloaded will be in there.  Select it.

1. Set it as your lock screen or Home Screen or both.

1. You now have a very crappy implementation of parallax.  It only takes up half the screen (unless you tilt it forward).  BUT, it does glide with the movement of your phone.


The point of this is that Parallax obviously can work on iPhone4, there is no system limitation since we can get it to work in this backwards way.  So, if anything it gives me a little hope that future betas will get it working right on the older phones.

I am not a programmer and don't really know how the ipad tracks touch information.

Would it be possible for a developer to create a pseudo touch sensitive app like sketchbook pro that could tell pressure variations based on the area of the screen that was touched. What I mean is if you touch lightly then only a small surface area of your finger is touching the screen, but if you press hard a larger surface area of your finger is contacting the screen. Is it possible for the ipad to tell this difference and could a developer exploit it to make apps a little bit touch sensitive to pressure?
