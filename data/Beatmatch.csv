1371507030.0,131,self.Beatmatch,1gjmtm,Why I'm not going to listen to your mix or leave feedback.,156,25,78,http://www.reddit.com/r/Beatmatch/comments/1gjmtm/why_im_not_going_to_listen_to_your_mix_or_leave/,"EDIT: Please visit [&lt;modpost&gt; How should we handle the posting of DJ mixes in /r/Beatmatch?](http://www.reddit.com/r/Beatmatch/comments/1gk5tu/modpost_how_should_we_handle_the_posting_of_dj/) - created by /u/djscsi.

I spend an awful lot of time on this subreddit and its sister /r/DJs and I often feel bad looking at the number of mixes looking for feedback with absolutely no comments but as soon as I click on them I nope right out of there remembering why I don't listen to them.

I am only one person and not a very important one at that but I hope by sharing my reasons for ignoring your mix it might be similar to the reasoning of others and that it might make posting your mix easier so you can get the feedback you need.

My reasons in no particular order for ignoring your mix:

- **""My First Mix""**: If you want to know what you can improve on your first mix the answer is everything. All I picture in my head when thinking about someones first mix is poor phrasing, key clashes, beat clashes, poor musical programming, and a host of other problems. I have never clicked on a first mix and been even remotely impressed. Posting your very first mix and looking for feedback is the same as posting ""how do I DJ"" without the mix so it's a waste of time. Practice a little more.
- **""[Electro Bangers/Dubstep/Trap]""**: I'm not one to judge people on their musical taste and I even like some Electro House ([*this track*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUnCwZhkIgQ) is epic) but the problem is that every single Electro/Dubstep/Trap mix is the same tracks just in a different order. I am so ridiculously sick of Deadmau5, Knifeparty, Skrillex, Zeds Dead, Zedd, and all of the other chart topping producers I can't even begin to explain it. A track list like that says to me that you haven't found your musical niche yet and you're still living on charts and there's nothing I can do to help you with that.
* **""[House]""** I'm a House/Tech-House DJ, there is nothing I'd love more than to help a fellow House DJ out but everytime I click on one of these mixes it's actually Electro House/Prog House and suffers from the problem in the point above. Please tag your mixes correctly.
* **When I do comment many people don't reply.** When I take the time to listen to a mix and type up feedback it's not something I bang together in 5 minutes; I actually listened to your one hour mix, listened to the transitions multiple times, and spent a good deal of time typing up as helpful a response I could. The least you can do is post a ""thanks for taking the time"" so I know you read it. For all I know you didn't want feedback and just link-spammed us and will never log in to Reddit again. Take the time to thank people for their comments, being ignored so many times has put me off the whole experience.
* **I'd like to see more information in your post.** Since almost no one on here posts video I can't tell what you're doing and my feedback to someone using CDJs is not going to be the same as it would be to someone using VirtualDJ and a mouse. Post some details about your setup, how the mix was recorded, and any post processing work you did. I'd also like to see people stating when the mix is using sync; I don't care but it does change whether I tell you that your beat matching is off or your beat grid is off when I hear a beat clash.
* **You're not active in this community.** This goes back to people not leaving replies and my fear that the mix is just mix spam; when I check your post history and it's all in /r/Pokemon and there is nothing in /r/Beatmatch or /r/DJs it makes me suspicious. Take the time to comment on some other mixes, even if you're new and don't have the experience and technical footing to go into huge detail you can still tell people what you did or didn't like about their mixes. I am far more likely to leave comments for someone active in this community and when you leave comments on other people's mixes maybe they'll be motivated to comment on yours, leave a link in your comment, start the ""I scratch your back, you scratch mine"" movement.

So in short you need to get active in the community, comment on other mixes and not expect everything for nothing, tag your mixes properly, post something we haven't heard 100 times, and say thank you when others take the time to try and help you.

Good Morning/Afternoon/Evening DJs! 

I see a lot, and I do mean A LOT, of posts on /r/Beatmatch and /r/DJs asking for musical advice because people have taken gigs that require a style of music they're not familiar with. It's understandable when you're new that you might want to take on as many gigs as possible even if it means going outside of your normal sphere but I really want to impress upon you the reasons that the veterans think this is a bad idea and why you get the downvotes that you do.

----

1) **Insufficient time to become properly acquainted with the music.** If you have to cram to get music for a gig because you don't already have any for the style needed you will not have a sufficient amount of time to get to know the songs, how they feel, and how they mix together.

You could easily be caught off guard when a song that skipping through sounded lyrical but actually had some really gritty drops for example.

----

2) **Insufficient time to build an adaptable library.** In a short time you will not be able to acquire enough tracks with enough variety so that if the crowd isn't feeling what you're playing you can switch it up within the same genre. 

Most DJs within their genres can create dozens of completely different sounding sets without leaving the base genre... Cramming for a gig will not give you enough variety to adapt to changing situations at the gig. Seasoned DJs do not stick to a pre-planned set if the crowd isn't feeling it, our adaptability is key and the only way you can be adaptable is with a large enough music selection and an intimate enough knowledge of the tracks in it (see point 1)

----

3) **You're taking gigs away from people who could do them better and eventually the same will happen to you.** 

If you play House as an example, and you've gotten very good at it but you cannot find any gigs playing House because dubstep DJs keep taking them all how would you feel? How would you feel if you went to one of those shows and someone was butchering it because they don't know how to play House and you could do it 10,000x better?

Karma is a bitch.

----

4) **Not all music is created equal.** Although the technical side of mixing is generally fairly consistent among related genres (4x4, syncopated beats, and so on), the way you actually mix the genre to get the proper feeling and do the genre justice will vary considerably.

For example, if you can technically mix Tech-House you can technically mix Electro House but the actual way you arrange and blend your tracks is considerably different between the two. Tech House lends itself to long and intricate layering where as the build-and-drop nature of Electro House with a greater reliance of vocals means Electro House lends more to quick cuts and fast blends. 

----

5) **Just because it's popular with other DJs online or on Beatport doesn't mean it's popular in clubs.**

I can give you my Top 10 House tracks of the moment or of all time but that doesn't mean my Top 10 will be crowd pleasers so asking other DJs for musical advice isn't always the best way to build a library. Further, even if I give you the top 10 floor fillers for my gigs the crowds in my geographical region may have widely different tastes than those in yours.

Knowing the scene in your city and the type of music people go out to see is paramount. It's not possible for a single person to follow every scene in a city which is why we tend to specialize in a smaller number of genres... 

----

6) [edited in] **If you're new, do you really want to play gigs you're not 100% prepared for and possibly ruin your name in your scene?**

Every DJ has bad nights but stacking the odds against yourself for the reasons above seems counter productive if you're new to gigging and you're trying to make a name for yourself. Until you have some recognition and are booking gigs consistently you shouldn't be doing anything that could make you look bad on stage. It's far too easy for new DJs to fade into obscurity if they don't leave a good impression early on.

As a promoter, I would respect you a lot more if you told me ""sorry, I don't think I'd fit in at this particular event but I'd love to play another one of your parties where I can play &lt;insert-genre-here&gt;"" than if you showed up and bombed a set you weren't prepared for.

----

In closing, it's good to practice a lot of styles and open yourself to all forms of music but when it comes those you choose to play ""professionally"" you should limit yourself and learn to say no to gigs you're simply not equipped to play.

**Story time:**

So I was looking for a DJ to fill an opening slot for an event I threw a few weeks ago. These kids got a hold of me begging for the slot. They didn’t have any mixes online but I needed to slot filled so I let them open. Boy, what a mistake.

When they started, I immediately noticed something was wrong. The sound that was coming out of the speakers was awful. I knew it had nothing to do with the speakers cause we had been running sound checks before the event without a problem. I walked up to the sound guys saying “Is it me, or does it sound like they are playing Youtube rips?” They agreed. To make matters worse, they kept going in the red thinking the problem was on the tech side. They sounded like shit for the rest of the set (with the exception of a few songs I know they got off of dubstep.net). If I had another DJ to finish their slot, I would have kicked them off in a heartbeat.

**A message to new DJs:**

I realize that getting music can be rather costly when you add it all up. When pirating is right around the corner it’s hard not to do it. But I will tell you as a guy who hires DJs, if it is obvious that you are using low quality files then you can bet your ass that I will never hire you again. There are plenty of DJs out there that spend their hard earned money on music, and to me those guys are dedicated to their craft. When I hear Youtube rips, it just shows me that you don’t want to be taken seriously.

This also applies to making a mix to send out to promoters. If I am listening to your mix and the quality keeps changing throughout it then I am going to delete it and move on to the next one.

When it comes to getting a lot of music, look into joining a record pool like [DJcity](http://www.djcity.com/) or [zipDJ](http://www.zipdj.com/). While a monthly fee may seem pricey, it's best to split the cost with another DJ or friend. Also, subscribe to the Beatport email list. They regularly give out coupon codes for 10-20% off a purchase. ~~If you are seriously strapped for cash then at least look at the file that you are downloading. If it isn't at least 256 kps then delete it.~~ Edit: Read bart2019's comment.

So do yourself a favor, delete those Youtube rips and get higher quality versions. It will help you out in the long run.",,False,self,t5_2syix,1362589451.0,,,True,t3_19s3i9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Beatmatch/comments/19s3i9/beginner_tip_youtube_rips_sound_like_shit_and_you/,

I made the decision last night after my little rant about mixes blew up to start a series of posts covering some of the topics that I think need a little more focus. My plan is to create a new post every few days and possibly include some videos at some point down the line on topics that I consider to be ""questions that should be frequently asked.""

Part of my rant yesterday included the fact that a lot of the mixes around here contain very similar tracklists so I am going to start this series of posts with some tips on digging for music in the digital age. We'll also go over a number of different sites where you can find music and touch on some of the free options like Soundcloud.

**A Quick Note on Piracy**

I do not condone the piracy of music for the purpose of DJing, if you choose to pirate your music that is your prerogative but I respectfully request that you not ask for or post links to illegal download services in this thread.

**Where to Find Music**

There are a lot of different sites these days where you can buy music, buy a record pool subscription, and even some sites where you can get music for free legally. I am going to provide a list, some supplementary links, and I am going to tell you which sites I use. 

* **Digital Music Sites**

and many of the sites above.

What I use: I use a combination of Beatport.com, ZipDJ.com, and LateNightRecordPool.com with some suplimentation from SoundCloud and record label promotional mailing lists.

**How to Find Top 40**

I am including this because it comes up an awful lot that someone has taken a Top 40 gig and has no idea what Top 40 even is. Top 40 literally means the Top 40 tracks on a given chart but it has also come to mean the majority of commercial music that sees play time on big radio.

You can find the current Billboard Top 100 here: http://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100 and the pop only chart here: http://www.billboard.com/charts/pop-songs. You should also supplement Billboard charts with charts from your local radio stations which should be available online so as to ensure you get any geographically unique chart toppers.

You can actually get the Top 40 music from pretty much any of the record pools above and a handful of the digital music sites including iTunes and Amazon. On some occasions you may even be able to find Top 40 bootlegs on Soundcloud or even official mixes from artists like Jump Smokers who often release free tracks.

**How to Actually Dig for Music**

Digging is a term that goes back to the vinyl days when we had to dig through crates upon crates of records in actual stores to find the absolute must have tracks because things were expensive back then and you couldn't just buy everything. These days the honest truth is that digging often means digging through the crap to find the music actually worth having.

I am going to tailor my examples to Beatport.com but they apply to most sites with any sort of breadcrumbs (that will make sense in a minute.) I am also going to focus on Electro House to appeal to the largest audience on this subreddit but it applies to all genres.

* NOTE: I highly recommend that you install [Reddit Enhancement Suite](http://redditenhancementsuite.com) and click ""View Images"" at the top so you can see the examples inline.

1. Start by opening http://www.beatport.com/ and then clicking the green ""GENRES"" button followed by ""Electro House""   
http://i.imgur.com/bBQH00u.png
2. There are four helpful sections on the first page of any genre, DJ Charts where other DJs have created their own Top 10 lists, the Beatport Top 10 for the genre based on sales (with a link to take you to the Top 100), the new releases which will show you some of the newest stuff available, and the staff picks which sometimes has some gems in it.
3. Take some time to explore the Top 10 and DJ charts and find something you really like. I personally really like Martin Garrix - Animals (Original Mix) so I am going to use it as my jump off. First I am going to add Animals to my cart by hovering over it and clicking the green ""+"" and then I am going to open Martin Garrix and Spinning Records in new tabs (both are links right on the chart).  
http://i.imgur.com/cYj3vFW.png
4. From Martin Garrix's page I am going to go through his personal Top 10 looking for anything else I might like and open some of the other record pools his tracks are found on in new tabs (Tiger Records, DOORN, Musical Freedom). Then I am going to click the ""Tracks"" link underneath his name and go through even more of his releases.  
http://i.imgur.com/88VfEq8.png
5. On the track list for an artist you will see that everything is clickable so if an artist has collaborated with someone or remixes someone else's music you can open that artist into yet another tab. From Martin's track list I added Julian Jordan to my list of open tabs.
6. As I finish on Martin's track list I am going to close that tab and move on to the next open tab which is the Musical Freedom record label page and go through their Top 10 and popular releases adding more things to my cart and opening more artists into new tabs before continuing on to the Tracks list for the record label.
7. On the record label tracks list I am going to sort the genre by Electro House so that I don't have to see anything else as I'm only digging for electro right now and then I am going to go through the first couple of pages previewing tracks and adding things to my cart. All the while I am opening yet more artists into new tabs.  
http://i.imgur.com/SFBxGKc.png
8. From this point on you continue to close tabs moving on to the next open tab and continue the same process of listening, sorting, opening new things in tabs, and repeating until you have found a suitable number of tracks. Keeping in mind that everything on Beatport is a breadcrumb (link) to similar content.

Tips:

* Every artist and record label has a blue ""Follow"" button on their page. When you follow an artist or label you will get periodic emails when there are new releases from that person or group.
* It is extremely important to use tabs when digging for music and a browser like Chrome or FireFox is the way to go. 
* If you like a particular song always follow the links to the artist(s) and label because you're likely to find similar content.
* If the preview is not long enough try searching YouTube for the song name and you're likely going to find it there.
* This process works for most digital music sites as breadcrumbs are common practice.

**Finding New Music With YouTube**

Many record labels and artists these days have YouTube channels with promotional releases. For example Spining Records from the examples above has a channel at http://www.youtube.com/user/SpinninRec and you can hit play on one of the playlists like the ""Exclusive Previews"" playlist and just let it go in the background while you do other things. If a song catches your attention write down the name to look it up the next time you go digging. 

**Who the Hell is Omers?**

My name is Nick and I have been playing clubs, raves, and festivals since 2004 in Western Canada. I started out as a hip-hop DJ and have gone through Garage, Hard House, and these days play House &amp; Tech-House. I maintain a weekly residency at a gay club and also play all over at raves and club nights along with festival appearances during the summer. 

I have also written two articles for DJTechTools.com which you can find here: http://www.djtechtools.com/author/omers/ one on Record Pools and one on taking gigs outside of your comfort zone.

This: http://i.imgur.com/t2tJ9.jpg

When I am looking for mixes to listen to I like finding them on YouTube where there is an actual video and I can watch what the DJ is doing. Too often you see people practising at home with their eyes glued to the screen because there is nothing else there to engage them. This bad habit is hard to break so when you practice for hours on end at home always looking at your screen it will happen when you get in front of an audience. 

Here are some ideas to help you break this habit at home so you can break it at the club/at parties.

- **Put a mirror on the wall in front of your setup.** It may seem narcissistic to watch yourself when you DJ but it really does help having something moving/alive in front of you even if it's your own mug. Not only will this give you something else to focus on but you can also see your form/technique from a different perspective and you may notice things like the fact you touch the knobs way more than necessary that you can correct.  
- **Face your setup towards a TV and find a video of people dancing.** This might sound even more lame than the mirror but it's another thing you can focus on instead of the screen and you can immerse yourself more by imagining the dancers on the TV are grooving to your beats.
- **Face your laptop away from you except when you're picking songs.** Find one of those spinning platforms used in the center of the dinner table and stick your laptop on it, when you're not picking the next song angle the laptop away from you so the temptation is gone... If this is not possible, minimize your DJ software instead.

There is nothing more depressing than a DJ who spends an entire set staring at their screen (except maybe a DJ using sync who's staring at their screen... seriously... what are they staring at?). Breaking the habit will help you engage an audience more which will set you apart. Audiences like a DJ who is engaged and who is dancing around; if your feet are planted in the same spot for a whole hour and you're not looking at the crowd you're doing something wrong... Breaking bad habits starts at home.",,False,self,t5_2syix,False,,,True,t3_16oskf,http://www.reddit.com/r/Beatmatch/comments/16oskf/a_tip_for_practising_to_help_you_avoid_serato/,

Take them how you want. Fellow veterans, please let me know if you think I have forgotten something.

1. Practice – Stop being lazy, nothing is going to make you a quality DJ other than practice. Instead of spending your free-time playing video games or talking about how you want to become a big time DJ on reddit, fire up your wheels and jam.

2. Stop with the micro-genre madness – Successful DJs rarely get booked if they list themselves as only playing “micro-step wobble house.” - Diversity can be your best friend.

3. It's the operator, not the equipment – Ask most DJs who have been around for a few years; chances are, they started out on cheap, used equipment – they managed to make it work, you will too. That $1,400 mixer will make your weak mixes sound like a Hi-Fi weak mix.

4. You are NOT a unique snowflake - You are semi-skilled labor: the market for club/party DJs is generally saturated – expecting promoters to seek you out is a surefire way to assure you never get out of your bedroom. You are also not an artist, a craftsman maybe - you are getting recognition for playing someone else's music. Be humble.

5. Don't anchor yourself to the scene, especially if you are in a smaller area. Friends and crews in the DJ game have their place – but don't pigeonhole yourself into one crew or production company. Once you begin playing live, keep your options open. Most people tend to be dead weight, why would you carry someone if they aren't willing to put in the work that you have?

6. Track selection - People are tired of hearing the same tracks over and over, do some digging. Buying every other track on the Beatport top 100 for ""Electro"" does not equate to quality selection. Find something unique, you will be surprised when you see your crowd's reaction.

Oh, and do a Google search please. The quickest way to burn your resources up is by asking the same questions over and over to the patient folks around here.

Just calling a spade a ""spade"" here. If I offend anyone's sensibilities, that is unfortunate. The best way to help these young pups is to be straight with them.

1345242172.0,35,self.Beatmatch,yef9z,On DJing at Gay Clubs (Mostly for Heterosexual Males) [xpost from /r/DJSetups],42,7,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/Beatmatch/comments/yef9z/on_djing_at_gay_clubs_mostly_for_heterosexual/,"It was suggested I post this here for those of you who might be interested in a residency at a gay club.

Where I live it's amazing. The two gay clubs are the only places that consistently play house music and can get away with housier remixes of the necessary top 40. I have not had to play a radio edit ever. We also have a monthly House/Tech-House night with zero top40 even in remix form (It's called 'We Are Not Pop') which is part of the regular programming and people love it.

Now, that said, some gay clubs in other cities are just like a standard top 40 club and some 'straight clubs' in other cities play the same type of music we do but where I am they are unique.

There are a couple gotcha's that are fairly universal to gay clubs thought that anyone interested should be aware of:

- Drag queens still play an important role in much of the gay scene so you may be called upon to stop everything and play something unusual for a drag performance at peak hours depending on the club. Our club doesn't do this but I know clubs that do.
- In the same vein, drag queens generally have a level of status in gay clubs where they get catered to and that includes you having to find ways to work stuff like The Gossip, Ce Ce Peniston, Florence and the Machine, and so on in to your mix when they request it (remixes of course).

There are also some things straight men need to be aware of if considering a gay club as a potential venue or residency:

- You will probably get hit on by guys. If you're a dick about it you'll be the one out the door not the patron. Just say 'sorry, I'm straight' being an ass about being straight in a gay club is a huge no no.
- If you have a lot of straight female friends that normally hang out with you in the DJ booth like many 'straight club' DJs, leave them at home or send them to the dance floor. Making a gay club look like a straight bar is a sure fire way to alienate the clients.  
- You will see shirtless guys, guys making out, and guys grinding on each other. Don't stare or make a deal out of it.
- Don't bother hitting on women (if there is female clientèle that is as some gay clubs are almost exclusively male) even if there are straight women there which inevitably there will be (fag-hags and such) they expect to be left alone at the gay bar.
- Gay clubs are a lot more sexually free than most heterosexual clubs. You may be asked by the owner to play up your looks by DJing shirtless or things of that nature (this isn't always the case but it may happen). 
- Also along the sexually free track, what might be considered 'sexual harassment' just about anywhere else might be perfectly normal in a gay club (fellow employees saying you have a nice ass for example or ass slaps). We're a lot less candid. If you have a serious issue with it, be sure to make it clear to the other people around you but you should be aware this is prevalent in the gay club scene.
- A lot of people who work in gay clubs, especially DJs are actually straight but you'd never know it just looking at them. Do not make outward attempts to assert your heterosexuality; don't wear ""I love pussy"" shirts, don't make out with your girlfriend in the bar, don't say ""I'm straight"" to every single gay guy in the place even if they aren't hitting on you.
- In straight clubs women come first, free cover, cheaper drinks and served first at the bar, and they get their requests played first (if guys get them at all). In gay clubs men get that treatment. Straight women in gay clubs are treated well but get no special privilege. 
- Just have fun.",,False,self,t5_2syix,False,,,True,t3_yef9z,http://www.reddit.com/r/Beatmatch/comments/yef9z/on_djing_at_gay_clubs_mostly_for_heterosexual/,
1363506184.0,34,self.Beatmatch,1ageut,Your hearing is important! Take care of it with these few tips!,36,2,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/Beatmatch/comments/1ageut/your_hearing_is_important_take_care_of_it_with/,"Hey /r/Beatmatch!

I'd like to share my thoughts and tips on protecting your hearing. I couldn't really find anything similar to a post like this in this sub-reddit, so I thought I'd write one up.

Your ears are extremely important to you, especially as a DJ. They are one of the most important tools you need to be able to even become a DJ. There's no real point to being a DJ if you can't hear properly or if you're deaf.

-----

Some people think your ears can heal from being damaged. This is **NOT** the case. The hairs inside your ears do not recover if they have been damaged. Once your hearing is gone, it's gone. There's no way to ""replace"" these hairs nor will they heal overtime like your cuts and bruises do. HEARING DAMAGE IS PERMANENT!

-----

**How do I protect my hearing?** - Here are a few things I've learnt over the years:

- The obviously one is to turn down the volume of your headphones/speakers, especially when you're listening to music for long periods of time. This is even more important if you listen to in-ear headphones, as they project sound directly into your ear canal. If you think the music's too loud, it is.

- Don't turn up the volume of your music if the train you're in is too loud and you want to drown the outside noise away. This is just adding more volume to the already loud enough noise outside, making it even worse for your ears. Bear with no music for the train ride or get some closed back or in-ear headphones.

- Try not to expose your ears to a noisy environment. For example, if you're walking past a construction site, and there are a lot of tools like grinders and jackhammers being used, try to keep away from them, or even cover your ears (make sure it's safe to do so!) until you're far away from them enough to not feel any pain in your ears.

- Go clubbing often? Don't be one of the retards that stand next to the blaring speaker with a drink in their hand, thinking they're so cool. It's not very cool when your ears are ringing after leaving the club and you're having trouble trying to hear what people are saying. YOU DO NOT WANT [**TINNITUS**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinnitus)!

- Get some musician's earplugs! This is going to be one of the best investments you'll ever make, even if you're NOT a DJ/musician. They lower the volume of sound around you, but not the quality. The universal fit ones only cost about $20, and I highly recommend them. You should definitely own a pair if you haven't already. 

    I suggest getting these: [Etymotic Research ER20](http://www.etymotic.com/hp/er20.html) and they claim to reduce sound by 20dB, which is extremely good and is probably all you need in places like clubs. (They come in 2 sizes: Standard and Large. As a rough guide, if you wear the smallest size tips with your in-ear headphones, you want Standard. If you wear Medium/Large sized earphone tips or above, you want Large.)

    You can get custom ones done, but these require you to get a mold of the inside of your ears, and sending them off to the company you're looking to buy the custom earplugs from. They start from ~$150. Well worth it if you go clubbing or DJ/work with loud sound a lot.

Here is an image that gives you the average decibel levels of things/sounds in daily life: http://i.imgur.com/PfdAvdQ.png

If you keep these points in mind, your hearing should still be good even until you're 60!

Without even listening to his mix I knew straight away what his problem was just by looking at the tracklist. A bunch of his songs were by Skrillex, sometimes back to back. 


I see this time and time again. Levels, Language, anything by Swedish House Mafia, Skrillex, and all of the billion Clarity remixes out there.


**BORING.**


You see, the DJ scene has fucking blown up to epic proportions. [Seems like everyone is one these days.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt6WFuo58Rw) That means there a ton of people out there trying to get a chance to play in front of a crowd. If your mixes have the same songs that everyone else is playing than how are you different? What makes you unique in anyway? Why should I hire you over the 10 other dudes that have the exact same sound? Did you really expect to play bangers for a 9 PM slot?


You need to expand your library. Branch out from the Porter Robinsons and the Aviccis. This doesn't mean you can't play the same style of music, you just have to go crate digging for some tunes that aren't so popular.


A neat way to look for new/unknown tunes is to [look up the various genre subreddits.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Music/wiki/musicsubreddits) Occasionally, a redditor will post his/her own songs that aren't signed yet. I assure you that they would have no problems with you throwing down their track at a party. I also tend to follow some of my favorite lesser known labels on soundcloud. They will release previews of most of the tracks they are putting out. It's a great way to find some new talent. Soundcloud can be an extremely useful tool if you use is correctly. Also, look up the New Tracks section of your genre of choice on Beatport. There are a lot of songs that get on Beatport that won't ever get noticed. If you are going to bangersonly.com to find music, **YOU ARE DOING IT WRONG.**


That said, having a banger or two in your mix won't hurt you. Just make sure they aren't the super overplayed one's.


Also, it doesn't hurt to try out other genres other than Electro House, DnB, and Dubstep. Maybe some Psy-Trance or Breaks to keep things interesting? Or how about some Swing House for that classy yet fun feel? Branching out from the norm will not only will help you stand out from the crowd, it will also help you master your DJ skills.


Sending out a mix to promoters that consists of mostly “unknown” songs shows that you actually give a fuck. You spent the time searching for songs instead of just downloading the top 40 chart on Beatport or iTunes like every other person out there. While this isn't a guarantee that you will get hired over the other DJs (since sometimes it's a popularity issue), it will definitely help out your chances.


**tl;dr Your song selection is boring and unoriginal. Expand your library.**


If any other veterans have more to add, feel free to chime in.


**Edit:** As GDIBass mentioned below, expand your library with good music, not with shitty music ([or Youtube rips](http://www.reddit.com/r/Beatmatch/comments/19s3i9/beginner_tip_youtube_rips_sound_like_shit_and_you/)).

1359608530.0,30,self.Beatmatch,17m22b,[Discussion] Why not ban the posting of mixes?,34,4,64,http://www.reddit.com/r/Beatmatch/comments/17m22b/discussion_why_not_ban_the_posting_of_mixes/,"People posting mixes on here are looking more and more lonely and desperate.  It's pretty obvious by now that people aren't getting feedback on their mixes, and often because people don't follow the posting guidelines.

**Therefore, I propose we ban the posting of mixes.**

A radical view for sure, but hear me out: posting short (&gt;5 minutes) transitions would still be allowed for technical critique, but &gt;30 minute mixes titled ""New mix!  Feedback please!"" would be treated and removed as spam.

It would free up this subreddit for more specific and constructive discussions.

*But dcurry431, where do I drop my mix for feedback?*

I'd recommend /r/mixes just to get it out there, and /r/edmradio so you can get a flavor of what it's like to to perform for a crowd, and force yourself to do it live.

Please tear this idea apart so we can hopefully hammer out a decent solution.

-----------

It's been pointed out (and I agree) that banning mixes is drastic.  I wanted to propose it as an extreme to provoke discussion.  Alternatives include:

* No change (The easiest solution)

* Making all mix posts be self posts (that require OP to describe what they view as strong and weak points)

* Having a time limit on mixes shared here (All of Song A --&gt; Transition --&gt; Swift fade-out of Song B)

* Requiring users to give feedback before getting it (In a weekly thread similar to /r/edmproduction)

* Better moderation of rulebreakers (deleting all posts without tracklists/transition times)

* Require all posts to have tags ([Mix][Gig][Discussion][Speakers][Controllers]) for easier sorting

------------

I'd really like to point out that /r/edmradio is a great resource for people who want advice on DJing.  Have no fear of being bad, just go on and doyathing.  There's always a crowd of at least five people, and if you make your post in advance enough and let us know in the IRC that you'd like feedback, you'll get real-time feedback and advice.",,False,self,t5_2syix,1371607216.0,,,True,t3_17m22b,http://www.reddit.com/r/Beatmatch/comments/17m22b/discussion_why_not_ban_the_posting_of_mixes/,
1343773857.0,29,self.Beatmatch,xh1p5,A moment of gratitude for r/Beatmatch. Thank you so much.,32,3,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/Beatmatch/comments/xh1p5/a_moment_of_gratitude_for_rbeatmatch_thank_you_so/,"About a year ago, I was listening to Wolfgang Gartner's track Yang and I came up with the idea of learning how to DJ/mix/whatever you want to call it. At first I dismissed the idea, thinking that, like learning an instrument or a language it would be too late to learn. 

Anyway, I put that behind me and download VDJ Home so I can basically learn the logistics of what I DJ does. When I first opened the program I had the biggest look of confusion on my face; I didn't know what a sync button was. My first couple of mixes were flat out terrible. A train wreck doesn't even begin to describe them. After so much experimentation, I finally began to scratch the surface of what it takes, to have a good mix. I understood transitioning, EQ, among other things. I finally began to have confidence in my ability. 

However, it came to a point that I realized that a mouse and keyboard wasn't enough. This is where I had to sit down and reflect on my future. Was I serious about this? Do I think I can take this to the next level? I spent about a week deciding what to do with my future. While I was browsing reddit one day, the lightbulb in my brain went off and searched all around for some sort of subreddit that can teach me about the intricacies of DJ'ing. Here's where I found you guys.

While snooping around here, I learned an innumerable amount of material. Concepts and ideas that I still keep in mind today. I found out that the Hercules MK4 was on sale and bought it right on the spot.  

Once my mixer got shipped to my apartment (about 2 months ago), I was about as giddy as I was when I first got a GameBoy. I took it out and pulgged everything in. I went straight to business. I've spent many hours playing with this thing, wanting to perfect my talents to hopefully pursue bigger and better things.

Now, I've always shown my mixes to my friends/family members asking for feedback and to spread it around. One day, I get a facebook message from a friend of mine and tells me the greatest news ever; someone wanted me to DJ their house party. I was so excited that I was almost speechless. I practiced harder than ever, making sure my skills were as fine-tuned as they could've been for this night.

Skip forward to that night, as I'm plugging in my computer I get super nervous. I start to wonder what I've gotten myself into. I shook it off, and with about 75-100 people surrounding me, I press play on the first deck. From that point for the next two hours, all I could do was smile as I saw all the people's faces smiling and all the bodies moving. It was one of the happiest moments of my life...

Luckily, I decided to record this set. I posted it up on soundcloud for two reasons. One, for the people at the party to enjoy it again and two, for you guys to critique it. 

I've posted it up multiple times and somehow, someway, it has nearly 500 plays. Now for some of you, that might not be much, but when all your previous mixes had only about 50 plays, this is a big deal. I feel like i'm so close to finally making it.

I just wanted to take this time to thank all of you who post relevant material, comment when I have thoughts, and support those of us who feel deflated at times. Your generosity has made me leaps and bounds better, not only as a DJ, but as person.

Much love.

**TL;DR: Didn't think I can hack it as a DJ but thanks to you guys I finally feel I'm heading in the right path**

To reach 10,000's of djing. I practice 3 hours a day no matter what, I get out of rehearsals at 2 sometimes and will stay up till 5 doing it before work the next day. Assuming I keep with the 3 hours a day the whole way through it will take me almost 9 years (if my math is right) to reach that goal. I've been doing this for about 6 months now and some of the things I notice about it this kind of practice is:

You stop sticking to any kind of genre after awhile. It honestly started to get boring for me playing the same kind of music all the time. I started to expand my taste and mixing genre's together simply because you will run out of music that will interest you.

Which brings up the next point. It will force you to keep finding new music. If you're stuck mixing the same thing over and over you'll lose your mind so you start looking deeper then most people do and trying to find anything that will work.

You'll try new things. Before I started doing this I never used effects and if I did it was always the same ones. But you start to really learn the in's and out's of your stuff and start to play around more and more.

I'm not saying all of this to brag about it or to say this is what you have to do. I just wanted to point out this 10,000 hour idea to people who ask ""How Can I Get Better?"" or ""What Should I Do Next?"" Why not just practice? Why not keep trying to get better? The more I practice the more I realize how much I don't know. And just the other day I realized another thought.
The 10,000 rule doesn't apply to all of djing. It relays to every element. I have to spend 10,000 hours beat matching to master it. I have to spend 10,000 hours using an effect to master it. This means that I will never truly be a master of djing. There will always be something I can improve on.

Hi there, /r/beatmatch.  I was recently made a moderator of this subreddit (thanks loshon), and I wanted to introduce myself.  I'm sure some of you have seen me posting on here, either under this user or under my original user Pr0metheusMusic.  To the rest of you, hello!  I've been a bedroom DJ for a bit over a year, starting with Ableton and an APC40.  From the APC40 I moved up to a mixtrack, and from there I moved up to 2 CDJ 900s and a DJM 800.  I spin mostly progressive/techno/electro/house with the occasional dabbling in DnB, moombah or dubstep.  Other than house parties I've only played out twice now, so I think I fit in well with the /r/beatmatch crew.  I browse this subreddit all the time, and try to be as helpful as possible when I can.  By day I am an operations manager at a small-medium telecom company.  I am a recovering computer game addict (not literally speaking - between a girlfriend, a dog, DJing, searching for music, organizing my library, producing and work I don't have any time for games any more).  If you have any other questions, ask away!  Anyways, onto the real purpose of this post.

Now, we don't have a lot of rules currently, and we plan on keeping it that way.  We'd like to keep the active posts on this subreddit pretty high, feel free to post your mixes, questions, basically anything related to beginner DJing.  We would however, like some input on keeping this community active and potentially drumming up additional users.  We have a couple ideas that should help us accomodate these goals, and we'd like your feedback!

**Mix Competition**

We'd like to start a monthly mix competition, kind of like how /r/DJs does it.  The main difference here is that we'd like to have the mixes be between 8 and 10 minutes.  This will make it easy for people to listen to multiple mixes, while still allowing us to hear 2-3 transitions and additional techniques.   So, with that said, we'd like a little bit of feedback here:

 * How should this be judged?  Would you guys prefer the traditional upvote method, or a panel of judges?  Note: the panel may be difficult to accomplish if the submissions come pouring in.
 * Would you guys prefer monthly, or bi-weekly contests?
 * Is 10 minutes too long/short or just right?
 * Any other suggestions/ideas for this type of competition?

**FAQ**

We've got a select few ""Marvelous manuals"" on the right side of the page to help people along if they are very new, but we were looking to potentially add more, and we're looking for some suggestions.  Do you have any great tutorials that should be linked on the right?  Send 'em our way!  If you have any other suggestions for the side bar, please let us know too!

**Subscribers**

Congrats, each of you now show up as 1 Beat Per Minute on the member count!

We're almost up to 2,000 subscribers after only 9 months.  The growth of this subreddit has been awesome, thanks mostly to the big boys over at /r/DJs pointing newbies this way.  We're looking for some other ideas to pick up subscribers.

We're *trying* (this being the key word) to get ahold of some event coordinators/DJs to agree to a Q&amp;A session (with questions taken from a post here).  We're thinking something like this could really drive up the user base, and keep this subreddit busy.  If you guys know any DJs or event coordinators who are pretty successful, and would be willing to answer a few questions, let us know!

If you guys have any other suggestions or ideas to get some more users into this subreddit, feel free to shoot one of the Mods a PM, or reply to this thread.

**Other feedback**

How do you guys feel in general about how this place is run?  Are the rules too lax?  Did you create an awesome image for the top of the subreddit?  Any changes you'd like to see to the subreddit itself?  Let us know.

Thanks for reading, and chiming in!

And then ask them to give feedback on yours. 

Others can then also learn from the feedback provided also. 

Having 5 mixes on the front page with no feedback is absolutely pointless. Either give feedback to other peoples or don't post a mix yourself.

Reasons: I played violin for 8 years of my life, then bass guitar for 7, and am now DJing and from my experience in all 3 I can tell you, if you're a beginner, you just don't know what you want. Here's my favorite example of just go with it and learn, as told by a tale of three bases.

 
~     


1.) When I was first getting into bass playing, I bought a red bass guitar. Standard body shape, nothing special, cheap, with a lame ""police line, do not cross"" strap and a matching red cord. 

This is most people's initial instinct when buying something, you lack skills, get something that looks totally fly, and I thought that bass would be perfect for my little alt. rock band my buddy started. 

This bass was perfect for my needs at the time, because it made noise. That's all I needed, a fairly acceptable noise maker. Then as I kept playing I learned shortcomings of that bass in-line with my style. I plucked the bass with my fingers, not a pick, and this bass was more pick inclined. 

I preferred booming low end bass and the pick ups here weren't very good, so it didn't compliment my style, and I ended up deciding it was too flashy.


~    
 

2.) My second bass I bought from a friend of a friend for what I'm pretty sure was an attempt for drug money. It was a black bass, had giant humbucker pick-ups, was easier to pluck, and had an active drive. The bass was amazing and I thought I had landed on my dream bass guitar. 

It wasn't flashy, I could show off my natural skills on it, and I thought I was going to destroy with this bass. As I got better though I realized that an active drive bass pushes the bass too hard through the amp and caused distortion, and as my skills improved and my tone became more important, my low end mattered less and an overall good sound was more important. 

That and I realized I didn't like the look of my bass, it was too heavy metal, I wanted something quirky to match the band I was in.


~ 


3.) Bass 3, I had learned that I needed loose strings, a passive bass(and something I didn't even know existed when purchasing bass 1 or 2), something that I liked the look of, and a bass that had a clean, but solid low end. I found it, I bought it, and loved the bass every gig after that.

Beginners: buy something you like, you have NO IDEA what type of mixer, turntables, cdjs, controller, brand, software/no software you want. Just get something inexpensive, make sure you like spinning and can enjoy it and have fun learning what your style is and as you learn you'll start realizing what products best fit it. 

This is something you wade into, making small purchases here and there, not something you dive into and drop 2k on because you want to ""try it out."" Get a cheap $300 controller, sit at your computer with headphones on and just see what you like. If you love it, great, if you don't? friend or pawn shop. Don't overspend and don't freak out about it, just get SOMETHING and learn by doing. That's the best way to figure out what music you like and what to get to facilitate that the best.

tl;dr just buy something cheap, you'll learn what's best for you over time. ",,False,self,t5_2syix,1339607331.0,,,True,t3_uzyvu,http://www.reddit.com/r/Beatmatch/comments/uzyvu/the_what_should_i_buy_im_a_beginner_debate_and_a/,

I was in awe of the music and the feelings the DJ's could convey through that music, the ease at which they could transition between tracks. 

At this point I just liked listening to the music and this was back when you had to buy the CD's not just listen to it on youtube or beatport. I remember listening to the same songs hours on end, fascinated by how they all fitted together into one big journey.

Fast forward lets say 4 years to when I was 15. I get my first computer and a few months down the road I torrent a cracked version of traktor. I could barely get a song to play in the damn thing let alone get these huge mixes like on the annuals. I was clearly upset, it was a lot harder than I imagined and maybe I would never be able to do this. I gave up, deleted the program off my computer and moved on to other things.

Maybe a year later I was back listening to songs, the EDM genre was growing and many new and awesome songs were being released. I had 10 or so songs that I really liked and wanted to put them on a CD to listen to. I downloaded Virtual DJ this time and got to work. Refreshingly VDJ was a much easier program to find your way around for a beginner and playing tracks was easy. I promptly found the cross-fader as my excitement grew, I was finally going to be like those guys, today was the day! What followed for the next few hours is something I hope no one ever has to hear in their life. I didn't know the first thing about beat-matching or dropping the song in on time or even fading for that matter. It was a complete train wreck, however I could actually get a start on this program and I think one transition I faded. I had a taste and even though I knew I was horrible I knew for the first time in a while that I could maybe do this again.

For the rest of high school I just played around on VDJ very sparsely. Maybe once a fortnight on average I would have a little play around then  realise I was horrible and quit out. After a while though I realised that I could keep time. I watched many tutorials about dj'ing but just figuring thing out by myself was the way to go. As time went on I found my self spending a whole evening playing on my laptop trying to match up beats and do a little fading between songs. I could never make more than one transition without stuffing up but it didn't matter because I was beginning to have fun. This was a big turning point because now I was getting in practice, getting better and enjoying myself at the same time!

Late in my final year of high school I made my first mix tape. It had 12 dub step songs on it and I made 3 copies. I gave one to my girlfriend, one to my best friend and kept one for myself. I never knew if they listened to it more than once but I loved it and I think I still have it in my car today. It was nowhere near those guys I first heard but I was getting closer and felt pretty good about myself.

The next year was my first year in university. I hardly touched my songs at all because I was so busy adjusting to the lifestyle (Read: Drinking) I completely forgot about it. I could see my real life career coming for me now and so nothing else mattered.

Something needed to happen to get me back into it, something like listening to those CD's in the first place that really excited me and made me want to achieve. That something was my first music festival. Here was young me sitting in my first mosh-pit when Nero comes on stage and lays down the most amazing set I have ever heard. Holy god, I still get shivers thinking about it. I almost died in that mosh-pit that day, but it was worth it! I remember going home that night and downloading every song I loved over the past 2 years. I was like coming back to the door crying and begging to be let in. Suffice to say that I have been to every festival that has come to my city from then till now.

I practiced my heart out and made some short 10-20 min mixes that were getting pretty good. It needs to be said that I was very shy and not many people knew that I was into this and did it as a hobby. I slowly mentioned it to a couple more people when we were on the topic of music and said I would do some mixes for people if they wanted. 

One year ago is when the ball really started rolling. My friend came to me and said he tried doing a mix for this party he was going to but couldn't do it and wanted my help. I pictured myself struggling in the beginning and could imagine what he was going through and agreed to help. He gave me the songs and we sat there all night getting 2 mixes perfect. They were 20 minutes each and were pretty close to flawless when I had finished them. He thanked me heaps and I asked him to judge the parties response to the music and give me feedback. About a week later he came back to me and said everyone loved them. He said they wished it was longer. I was ecstatic!

Up until this point I had been worried about really spending money on anything because I wasn't exactly great at sticking to my hobbies (Seriously I still have a $600 telescope that I used like once). I knew that to move on from this stage I had to get some hardware and learn on that. I knew the basics but that was really all, you don't see someone at a festival just playing on a computer the whole time. I knew I wanted to stay with my software background so I could move on faster without a big stall to learn how to use decks again from the beginning so I did heaps of research and finally dropped the cash. Traktor S4 was my choice but that doesn't matter at all, it is all personal preference so don't buy it because I did. Do your research first.

I stalled a little with the new learning curve and I would still go back to my VDJ a lot because I could't do something on this new fancy machine that I just bought. I almost gave up again, I thought I had wasted all my money yet again because I can do the same things for free on the laptop alone with my trusty VDJ. I persisted because I knew I wouldn't be taken seriously in the big world if I ever made it there. 

It was about this point where I read a book caller ""Outliers"". It is all about what makes a successful person different from an average person, it is definitely worth a read. One of the points that really stuck in my mind was when he said it takes 10,000 hours to truly master something. Really he just put a number on the old saying, practice make perfect, but for some reason that made it seem achievable. I thought, all I need to do is play on these decks for 10,000 hours and I will be a professional. I would spend every spare minute just to run over to my decks and just do a quick fade because I knew that was adding onto my 10,000 hours. I quickly got passed the stall and moved on completely from VDJ realising all the potential I now had with this new controller.

I went to my friends birthday party about 6 months ago. We all went to his house for some drinks then got on one of those party buses that took us into the clubs in town. We piled on to the bus and the music started. I was dancing for a while and then I noticed that I knew the order of the songs. It was the mix that I had first done for my other friends party. I asked him where he had got it and he said how my other friend had handed out the mix to pretty much everyone who would listen and they all really enjoyed it. I felt great at this point, I wasn't sure if it was the alcohol or the sight of everyone dancing to my mix but I'll pretend it was both. After we got off the bus I was approached by another friend, he asked if I made that mix and if I DJ'ed much. I think the alcohol took over and explained how I was on the path to fame and soon I would be performing at every venue in my city. He asked if maybe I would like to play at an event his school may hold later on in the year. Still brimming with confidence I accepted without hesitation. I actually had to call him to ask if it actually happened the next day because I was so sure that I dreamt it. He said the offer was legit and he would contact me if they got the go ahead for funding.

Over the next few months I kept up my practice, adding to my hours all the time. I made sure I had the latest songs and started a monthly mix which I would give to all my friends. Finally people were starting to know what I did and they were excited about it too. I was doing mixes for peoples birthdays that I would pre-record and give to them to play on the night. I always got great reviews from them and I loved doing it. It just wasn't the same as performing live though. 

2 weeks ago I get the call, they got funding and the event is going ahead and I am booked down to DJ. I said of course and told them not to pay me because it was my first time and I had no idea how it was going to pan out (I also knew this would give me the edge over any competition). I was excited but scared at the same time, all the things that could go wrong, all the horror stories from DJ's I had read came flooding back. I made mixes so that if I was struggling I could just chuck one on and be safe for 20 minutes. This was all about survival not reading the crowd or anything like that!

The day finally comes. I rock up slightly early and begin plugging speakers in (also the first time I had encountered PA systems but I had done my research so it all went down fine). I booted everything up and put a 16 bar loop on the intro to a song with just the kick drum. I got the levels right and eq'd the amp properly then dropped out of the loop. 

I knew I had about 3 hours to play, my longest set beforehand was about an hour and I was really worried about running out of music. I had read the Wolfgang Gartner AMA a few days prior and saw that he wrecked his first gig. That put my mind at ease as the intro finished and we got into the music. I came up to the first transition, hand ready on the play button for the second deck. The first transition was not pretty lets put it that way. I looked up to the crowd of about 300 and no one cared at all. They were still moving to the beat. The confidence grew as the set went on and as the 3 hours finished I still had plenty of songs left in the bag and could have kept the show going. I never even had to revert to my safety mixes.

I was thanked and got a big cheer from the crowd. I couldn't stop smiling my dream had been realised at that moment. The principal of the school came to me and said if they have any more events or socials that I would be their first choice and next time they would pay for sure. I thanked them probably way too much, packed all my gear up and drove off still smiling.

Hopefully you can take something from this story and apply it to what ever stage you are at. Remember that everyone starts at the first hour of their 10,000 at some point and you can only move up from there. If you ever feel like you have stalled then just keep practicing, make a 10 minute mini mix or practice some scratches it all adds up.

Sorry it turned into more of a life story but take what you can from it and I would love to hear what stage you are at, or how you got you first gig. I am definitely not a professional but I feel that many struggle to get this step up so I want to share how I did it in the hope you can too.

My biggest tip would be to make some mixes and give them to people, get know in your circle of friends for it then you never know who they might mention it to and get you an opportunity.

First off, if you think this is a good idea, Up vote it to get exposure (I don't get the karma)

So I've come up with an idea that will help improve the skills of DJs here new and old and have fun while doing so.
The Mix of the month competition is great for getting feedback, but what many people find with listening to many mixes is that it takes a lot of time. So while the MOTM comp is still run every month, fortnightly I'm going to set a challenge and provide an example to demonstrate what I mean. This however dosent you copy what I've done, instead you should try your own adoption.

Challenges will vary from mixing techniques to song selection, to useful effects, 'tricks', shaking things up, etc etc. To enter, simply attempt the challenge and provide the audio recording (Some challenges may require video). Audio / Video shouldnt exceed 5 minutes, but ideal duration will be upto each challenge. The point is to keep it short and sweet though. 

The judge is you! There will be no winner of the challenges but when you submit, check out a few of your fellow DJs attempts and provide some feedback weather it good or bad, you'll probably learn some cool things in the process. Open to any platform of DJing, even if you just use a Keyboard and mouse.

I'm also looking for moderators of this sub to endorse this thread to help get the exposure and promote DJs here to participate. As well as a section on the side bar.

Stay tuned becuase the first challenge will be released soon after Christmas! (So you can try out all your new DJ goodies)",,False,self,t5_2syix,False,,,True,t3_159g15,http://www.reddit.com/r/Beatmatch/comments/159g15/fortnightly_challenges_have_you_got_what_it_takes/,

A couple questions from a First Timer (X-Post from r/DJs),21,3,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/Beatmatch/comments/1i0vxj/lets_talk_about_being_an_opening_dj_a_couple/,"I am opening for Savant and was wondering if you guys could shed some light on a couple questions: 

1.) Which songs should I play? it would be really easy to play straight bangers BUT because I'm there to warm up the crowd, I don't want to just go crazy and wear out the crowd.  

 2.) Should I play my own music? I have over an hour's worth of my own productions that I could play, but I also know that when people go to the club, they want to hear songs that they've heard and I very much doubt anyone has ever heard of me ahahah.

3.) How long of a setlist should I go for and should I plan ahead for it? I know that the club I'm mixing at will have a specific amount of time they want me to shoot for, but I haven't heard what that is yet, son I'm betting it will be over and hour. Usually when I mix, I have about 20-30 minutes of the set planned out from the start of the mix, and then I fill in the rest of the hour or so with tracks on the fly. I guess what I'm really wondering is if I should plan out the entire thing, or do what I usually do?

Anyway, I know that's a lot of questions, but if anyone who has done this kind of thing before has any experience with opening, any advice/tips would be wonderful.  Thanks :)

Just wanted to introduce everyone to or remind everyone about using key matching when you play your sets.

The reason this is important is when you're overlaying one track on another, if the keys don't match and there are musical elements (anything other than percussion) playing from both tracks, it can sound unpleasant to the listener's ear. To oversimplify, each track that you have will be in a specific key -- say, A minor for example. That key corresponds to a numeric code (in this case, 08A) on the camelot wheel, which you can find [here](http://mediacontender.com/images/posts/HarmonicMixing_CamelotWheel.png). From looking at the wheel, you can see the two keys that would mesh most naturally with A minor: 09A and 07A. You don't have to stick with just one move to the left or right on the wheel though, the numbers just indicate which keys have the most notes in common with each other, which is why A minor sounds fine when mixed with a track in D minor or E minor.

One downfall of this program is that it can be hard for DJs that are just starting out to get an indication of what key their tracks are in. Thankfully, beatport.com is a pretty decent resource -- any track that you buy off of that site will have the camelot wheel numerical value available to you, although generally I think you have to add it to the file's ID3 tags or comments yourself. And since they have a pretty extensive catalog of music, you can always search out tracks that you have gotten elsewhere with their website's search, to see if they have the key info. If you have tracks that you have gotten elsewhere and you can't find the camelot wheel info on beatport, you can break out your synth (or a synth app on your phone, for that matter) and work out the key from there by playing scales and listening for what sounds right. A good resource for finding out what piano keys correspond to which scale can be found [here](http://www.pianoworld.com/fun/vpc/piano_chords.htm).

Key matching isn't necessarily the golden standard for mix DJs, but it is a useful tool that, if used correctly, can help ensure that you never play two tracks with clashing keys over the top of one another.

**TL; DR: If you don't already, use the camelot wheel to take your DJing to the next level.**

1st thing is make sure you can beat match by ear, I honestly don't care what you use just make sure that we don't have to stop the music or have a horrible transition between DJs.

2nd. Don't use preplanned sets spend some time learning your music so you can mix on the fly, nothing is worse than a DJ who doesn't read the crowd for a show.

3rd you probably have access to a lot of alcohol, wait until after your set to get blitzed you think this would be obvious but I've had a serious problem with this lately.

4th have fun with the times you are given, even if its from 10-11 and no one is really there, you should still be able to have some fun, use that time to experiment and get better especially if the place is slow.


I figured these would be kind of helpful and some tips that I've noticed that a lot of new Dj's are having problems with.


ps. Don't redline the mixer please it makes the sound quality horrible, and damages equipment.

1372096788.0,18,self.Beatmatch,1gzcub,Weekly mix feedback thread - 6/24/2013,19,1,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/Beatmatch/comments/1gzcub/weekly_mix_feedback_thread_6242013/,"**Note:  Please [sort this thread by new!](http://www.reddit.com/r/Beatmatch/comments/1gzcub/weekly_mix_feedback_thread_6242013/?sort=new)**

Welcome to the first Weekly Mix Feedback thread on r/beatmatch!  This is the thread where you post your DJ mixes and ask other people to give you feedback.  Mix posts that are not in this thread will be removed.  We are taking some cues from /r/edmproduction here, as well as incorporating input from users and most of the previous mix submission rules.  We are open to changing the format/rules so please let the mods know if you have any feedback on this.


These threads are intended for beginning DJs who are honestly looking for feedback or critique on their technique, selection, transitions, etc.  If you are an established DJ who is just looking for more followers/listens on your new mix or have a podcast/radio show, please post it to a more appropriate place such as /r/mixes or a genre-specific subreddit.   This subreddit is aimed at helping new DJs learn and is not the place to promote yourself!

Rules:

* Please include the genre(s) of your mix.  This helps attract DJs/listeners of the same genre(s) who are likely to provide more useful feedback.  You might also include a title/length.

* [Mixcloud](http://www.mixcloud.com) is the preferred place to post mixes.  It allows you to include your tracklist and transition times, allows unlimited uploads, and is generally more geared towards DJs.  If you don’t want to use Mixcloud, be sure to include a tracklist.  

* Please ask for specific feedback or list parts of the mix you liked/didn’t like.  Hopefully you are looking for input on specific tracks or transitions.   Feel free to also link to a few instances where you provided someone else good feedback.  Being active in these threads should encourage more people to listen to your mix.

**Example post:**

&gt;[House / Tech House] djscsi - moving on up  (45 minute mix)
&gt;
&gt;http://www.mixcloud.com/djscsi/moving-on-up/
&gt;
&gt;I’ve been spinning for about a year, this is the third mix I’ve recorded and I’m hoping to get some house / tech-house DJs’ opinions on my track selection and mixing.  I really like the first few transitions but I feel like I lost some of the energy when I brought in the Maceo Plex track at about 13:30.  I messed up a couple parts but I’ve listened to the mix a few times and I think it sounds pretty good.   Does anyone think I used too much FX?

Since then, we have established a warm and welcoming community on IRC, have hosted genre nights and have had plenty of DJs play some really great shows. But now we're taking things to the next level, and that is why we're renaming and rebranding as bside.fm.

The fact is, it became clear that we were not just about out EDM, but about any great music in general. We've had jazz, funk, soul, hip-hop, disco and anything else you could think of on the station up until now, and whilst we still definitely enjoy our electronic music, why would we decide to limit the amount of awesome music we can play?

If you're a listener, we're sure you'll find something that you'll enjoy; be it a great piece of music that you've never heard before - or just the comforting sounds of our excellent radio presenters voices as you sink in to your armchair.

If you're a DJ, sign up on our website and come mix. Beginners are welcome, our only rule is you have to really love your music and we ask that you have a mic to really make the shows 'live'. Please include a link to a social network with recent mixes up, just so we can make sure you're somewhat competent.

We have music running all night brought to you by some of our station's more regular DJs and admins, so do join us and meet the crew in the live chat on the website.

It was only a half hour set (I was actually hoping for more), but the crowd was totally digging what I dig. To give you an idea, I played [Swedish House Mafia- Save the World](https://soundcloud.com/officialswedishhousemafia/swedish-house-mafia-save-the-1) as a sort of halfway between pop (what you'd expect a high school crowd to like) and the sort of thing I like. It went OK, but I decided to take a risk and test my luck, and played [Zedd's remix](https://soundcloud.com/zedd/savetheworld-zeddremix) right after- and they went nuts! Another one that went down really well was [Alex Metric &amp; Charli XCX - End Of The World (Russ Chimes remix)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbHm2HBn32E). Pretty much everything else I threw down went really well, too- once you get the crowd moving, it's so much easier.

Thankfully, nobody noticed my one trainwreck (to be fair, it's hard as fuck to beatmatch with speakers a full second behind earbuds). 

I did get a couple ""DURR WHY U DON PLAY THRIFTSHOP DEEJ??"". I didn't want to straight up say no, so I was kind of like, ""I'll see what I can do"". 

Anyway, I got a lot of compliments and fistbumps after the set, which is huge for a first set. It's cheesy, I know, but thank you to everyone here for helping out newbies like me, and helping us not to completely eat shit our first time. I was scared as shit for the first few minutes, but then once I realized that I was doing exactly what I do at home, I relaxed much more.

I'll keep this thread short and sweet.  If you have any questions about these announcements please let us know.

1. Regarding mixes: The posting a mix guidelines are now RULES.  If you would like to post a mix for feedback you MUST follow the rules on the sidebar.  Mixes posted without following these rules will be removed.

2. To help us enforce these new rules we have brought on a new mod.  Please welcome /u/djscsi!

3. A few months ago we decided to do a small partnership with /r/edmradio.  They are a small subreddit that has their own live stream online.  If you're looking to play to a small crowd over the interwebs please head on over there and get set up.  If you are not already subscribed to that subreddit please take a moment of your time and hit the subscribe button.

A lot of people ask how to get gigs. This is what I did:

* Randomly found a club post on Facebook

* Looked up some info about the club. Apparently they have a nice sound system and lasers. That's what I want.

* Sent an email to the club's website. Guy responds with phone number

* I call the guy after my class. I ask what nights he has open next month. I ask for Thursdays, maybe Tuesdays. He asks how many people I can bring in, I explain that it'd be like 20-30 the first time, and escalade from there.

* He says his usual pay rates are $100, I say that's great, and he throws on 10% commish from bottles as a bonus.

* He doesn't even ask what kind of music I'll be playing or samples of my mixes. He just trusts I can bring that many people in (I don't want to get paid if I bring in a small number, that'd be ripping him off)

To get to this point, I practice every other day with my controller (now my first ""upgrade""). I've been doing house parties for about a year now, and a small college bar twice. I've learned to read the crowd, keep on tempo, beatmatch, and am on a strong path to being able to play with my eyes closed. Its all about being forward and friendly, and social networking is a big plus. I prefer to do it the genuine way, getting close friends to go and bring in people I haven't met.

Now I have a club with nice speakers and lasers until 2am. Reddit helped, and I just wanted to help anyone new.

1371522495.0,16,self.Beatmatch,1gk5tu,[modpost] How should we handle the posting of DJ mixes in /r/Beatmatch?,17,1,47,http://www.reddit.com/r/Beatmatch/comments/1gk5tu/modpost_how_should_we_handle_the_posting_of_dj/,"EDIT:  After 24 hours, Option 1 to move all mixes (aside from MotM) to a weekly mix feedback thread looks like the winning choice, with 19 upvotes and zero downvotes.  This seems to please everyone so far, so it is the direction we will be going at this time.  If anyone has any serious complaints about this, please let us know!

Hi /r/beatmatch,

This topic has come up several times in the last year or so, and a lot of folks seem to have strong opinions about it, so we wanted to revisit how the community feels and decide how to move forward.  There seems to be a lot of feeling that there are too many mix posts, that there is not enough feedback given, that this isn't really the right place to post your new mix, etc.  Some of this is currently being discussed in this post by omers:  [Why I'm not going to listen to your mix or leave feedback.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Beatmatch/comments/1gjmtm/why_im_not_going_to_listen_to_your_mix_or_leave/)

TL;DR: If you don't want to read the rest, just post a comment stating how you feel and what you think the moderators should do (if anything).

So we feel that we have a few options as to how to proceed:

1)  Relegate mixes to a weekly (or monthly) thread so that people can listen and give feedback all in one place.  People who are interested in listening and providing feedback would participate in the thread, and the ""my first mix"" posts would no longer bother everyone else.  This would be in addition to the MotM contest and would have a sticky note on the top of the subreddit page.

2)  Create a new/separate subreddit for mix feedback.  This could be combined with option #1, people would post their mix in the new subreddit, then post a link to it in the weekly thread.  The benefit of this would be that the weekly thread would not be cluttered with comments as each mix would have its own post to comment on.  It could also potentially spawn a separate community for mix feedback with people who are interested in helping others improve.

3)  Leave everything as it is, continue allowing mixes.

4)  Ban individual mix posts altogether.  People can use the month to work on their skills and submit something to the MotM contest.

Since this has come up a few times I thought I'd include links to some previous discussions in addition to the thread omers started:

* [Is this subreddit for posting mixes or for general questions/answers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/Beatmatch/comments/pw8io/is_this_subreddit_for_posting_mixes_or_for/) (1 year ago)

* [Why not ban the posting of mixes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/Beatmatch/comments/17m22b/discussion_why_not_ban_the_posting_of_mixes/) (4 months ago)

So we would like everyone to please comment in this thread.  If you have posted a comment previously in another thread, feel free to repost it here so ""your vote is counted.""  If you have an idea that is not listed above, we would love to hear it.   If the results here don't seem clear or the opinion seems very divided, we can make a more proper survey with SurveyMonkey or something.  If there are any questions/topics/options you think should be included on such a survey, including demographic info, please make those suggestions.

Basically, just reply with whatever you think the mods should do, why you feel that way, any other problems you see, any ideas we missed, or any other general opinions/complaints.  Feel free to politely debate people who disagree with you and upvote the people who most succinctly agree with you.

This month we're going with a throwback theme.  You can ONLY play songs produced before 2000 (No recent remakes of those songs or remixes either!).  Bust out your oldschool tunes and get mixing!

Here are this month's rules:

 * Your mix can be no longer than 15 minutes, no exceptions
 * You must tag transition times and songs on the mix itself (doesn't have to be mix cloud this month, but the tags must be on the mix, not your reddit post)
 * You can ONLY play songs that were produced before the year 2000.  You can play remixes, but only if those remixes were done before 2000.
 * Submissions close at 8 PM Pacific Time on Wednesday June 26th
 * You will be required to leave feedback on 2 other mixes **in the voting thread**

Voting thread will be posted shortly after submissions close.

We ended up grabbing a Kontrol S4 and a Maschine about a month ago, and they've been amazing (The S4 actually has some surprising production abilities, although if you're running a PC, beware of USB 3.0) and while we're still learning the hardware, I'd like to discuss transitions a bit.

So, at a local DJ/Electronic show that we went too last night, it seemed that none of the artists were making smooth transitions between tracks. A lot of stopping the groove, and launching the next clip. It seemed to pull from the flow of the floor and left people hanging.

Myself and my buddy have always said that we want to keep the groove flowing between tracks and really hate those abrupt stops, so what are some techniques/tips/advice that you all have that we tryout/practice?  

Keep in mind we're still new to Traktor and the whole mixing thing in general but at the same time we are running a live Maschine with the setup, so we can actually make transitional beats on the fly, but as far as techniques for blending tracks, we're pretty new to that concept.

I'll give you a little background, and where I'm at now; I'll try not to make it too large.

Guitarist of 8 years, and have played in a few bands. One of which was legit; played relatively large shows and recorded an EP. Time passed, and I left the group for reasons. More time passed, and I noticed a large hole in me; I missed performing music. I really got into electronic dance music, with Nu-Disco and Electro House as my main goto's. 

I simply cannot do without performing music, I just miss it too much. Granted being a DJ, not all the music is going to be mine; and that's okay. I just miss giving the crowd and entertaining and fun evening. I am also bedroom producing my own work with Ableton.

SO. I'm wanting to put some money in for the equipment I'll need to be able to actually perform. This is where my knowledge dwindles, even with the power of google. I'm hoping to chat with you guys on a musicians level here; I need help deciding what gear is best suited for me.

I know there's tons of different controllers, some are just knobs, some have wheels, some have both. Some are just pads you can hit. I really can't decide what style is best suited for myself. Do I have to have the scratch wheels? Will it make me less of a DJ if I don't?
I have DJ'd one party of a friends with a very ghetto set up which included my Axiom 25 Key controller, my speaker system, and Ableton Live 9. 

What I do know, is that I LOVE manipulating the sound; I love using band passes, low passes, high passes, delays, reverbs: The effects. Simple to use, and I'm sure I've only scratched the surface. But I know that I really enjoyed manipulating the track, setting the mood, and the like. I'm definitely a 'digital dj' as I've heard, and I'm very excited to get into this and learn a new music trade. But I just don't know what kinda of gear best suits me, and is most affordable.

I've been practicing DJing for about two and half years religiously with the intention of making it my career. I've done quite a few house parties and have a (very) small fan following on Facebook. I will be turning 18 in a month and it is my dream to get a residency at a club. I know this will not be easy however so I've come to you guys for advice and hoping you can answer a few questions.

1. How do I go about getting club gigs?

2. Is there any legal things I should get sorted out before sending my stuff off to clubs/playing at them?

3. I have always used Turntables with wax or Traktor Scratch but I am fairly competent with CDJs. Will it be a problem if I bring along my laptop and hook it up to the club's turntables or should I just become proficient in what the club's gear is?

4. If not nightclubs where else would you recommend me starting out in the industry?

5. What is the best way to approach venue owner's/club managers etc.?

6. What sort of attitude should I approach people with?

7. How long do you recommend I make demo tapes go for? I was thinking of making hour long mix tapes for each genre I'm interested in and then sending those CDs off to clubs which specialize in that genre.

8. Email? Letter? Phonecall? In person?

9. How to avoid any common fuckups?

10. Best ways to promote myself?

Your experiences as a resident would also be much appreciated! ",,False,self,t5_2syix,False,,,True,t3_xe0n6,http://www.reddit.com/r/Beatmatch/comments/xe0n6/seeking_advice_for_getting_into_the_industry/,

I started spinning on a single direct drive turntable in 1987 with no pitch control, and paired a technics belt drive turntable with a pitch control - but it certainly was no 1200.  With that table without a pitch control, we had to manually spin the platter faster during beatmatching, or change the one which did instead, which was tough. When I finally got my 1200's, I laughed, cause I felt like the turntables were doing the work for me.

Fast forward 20 some years.  The DJ controllers now do most of the work for you, you can do a ton of things that were downright impossible before (e.g. adjust tempo without changing pitch).  Different music (before, Depeche Mode, New Order, Old School House, now, pretty much Trance/Progressive for me)

I noticed even pro DJ's don't beatmatch for a long time, even on largely instrumental tracks.  Heck, I'd mix dub versions of songs for a 3+ minute beatmatch.  Today, they'd call that a mashup - and from what I've gathered, they are largely pre-recorded (or do they do them live sometimes?)

I also like the beatmatch to be a means of gathering energy for the next track, and use the next track by itself as sort of a ""drop"" as people would say.  That is, I wouldn't lower the EQ much during the mix other than to avoid phase cancellation.  Now, beatmatching is more transparent.

I assume I'm somewhat alone for this?  Thoughts/discussion?

1364153180.0,13,self.Beatmatch,1axehb,So....my Traktor S4 has spoiled me and I lost beatmatch skills from years ago...need some help!,14,1,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/Beatmatch/comments/1axehb/somy_traktor_s4_has_spoiled_me_and_i_lost/,"Hey guys!

So long story short, about 10 years ago I used to play house records on my Technics and I was decent at beat matching. Nothing great but I knew what I was doing, and could pull off an ok mix without any BPM counters or anything.

Then I got a DJM 500 mixer and fell victim to the dreaded BPM counter. My mixes got exponentially better but any 'natural' beatmatching skills I developed started to fade.

Then I moved on to Serato, and the BPM counter and visual element totally removed my need to beatmatch manually (sad I know lol).

Then I moved on to CDJ-1000's which I again used digital means to beatmatch with.

About 7 years ago, all my gear got stolen so I just stopped.

Last year I bought a Traktor S4 and never even bothered to reestablish any of my beatmatching talents because I could beatgrid and master sync.

I always thought to myself, ""Whatever I could beatmatch manually in the past I could do it again"". Boy was I wrong! I underestimated what 7 years removed could do to my abilities!!!

Last weekend I'm at a house party with my friend playing. I hop on the decks just to mess around and his setup is just two CDJ MKIII's with a random mixer with a BPM counter.

Even with the BPM counter I could just NOT get my shit together. Traktor has spoiled me and now I'm what I used to hate most. Someone who relies on technology and cant 'kick it old school' so to speak.

So now what I'm looking for is kind of a 'workflow' on how to beatmatch naturally. Sorry if I use outdated terminology below but I'll attempt to describe what I attempt to do. I'm starting to realize I'm having difficulty picking up the 'ear' to tell if I need to speed the track up or slow it down. I'm having a big issue with telling which baseline belong to which track so I cant tell if the queued track is ahead or behind of the live track.

So I'm playing typical house music with a 125-132ish BPM. 

Track A is playing live through the monitors (let's assume 128 BPM).

Both tables are set at a 0.0% tempo slider so they are both at their 'stock' BPM

I que up track B to the first beat and then let tracks A and B run through my headphones.

I count down the end of the 32 bar measure of track A and get ready to play track B (not live, but through my headphones obviously)

so I count down 5,6,7,8 and on beat 1 of track A I hit play on track B.

This is where all hell breaks loose (obviously lol)!

Now I'm in the middle of a train wreck in my headphones and I need to get the tracks beatmatched then go back and redrop track B on Tracks A's '1 beat' to have them matched and in phase.

This is where I simply cannot tell if track B is ahead or behind track A because there is just SO much going on.

So I try trial and error.

The first step...is assuming possibility they are already somewhat close to the same 'natural' BPM and I may have just played track B too early or too late to coincide with the 1 beat on track A.

So I spin track B's side platter ahead slightly to do pitch adjust and see what I got. If that makes it worse, I spin it slightly back.

If they just can't seem to get in phase, I assume the BPM of Track B is different from Track B and tempo adjustments need to be made. 

So I'll slide Track B's Tempo up +1% and repeat the process of dropping it on the 1.

I'll do the same platter spins and see what I get. If not then I'll repeat the process but with track B's tempo now at -1%. Same deal with the platters.

I'll repeat this process going 

+2%/-2%
+3%/-3% etc etc

This is wayyyyy too much trial and error and is just taking too much time. I know conceptually what I'm doing will work...but when doing a mix it can be a crunch for time so I need to figure out the error in my workflow process.

So what am I missing here guys? Obviously practicing, and knowing your tracks is key. But is my 'workflow' flawed and are there some tips and tricks you may be able to recommend?

I got there hella early with dj #2 to help set up, move furniture etc. but unfortunately the guy with the P.A. was DJ #1 and he didn't show up until the party was supposed to be starting basically. Whatever he got there we set shit up and he put on a pre recorded mix because it was a total sausage fest of like 20 dudes for the first hour or so. Once people start trickling in he gets on and starts playing a trap set. He literally mixed through 10-15 well known bangers in the first 30 minutes of his 2 hour set. He and I had talked a few days before about what I was planning to play and he just disregarded that and tore through the top 50 trap tracks that EVERYONE knew in the first hour and a half. So I was a little bummed because while I had tons of music a lot of the ""crowd-pleasers"" had already been dropped less than an hour into the party when people were hardly drunk enough to even dance. 

So skip forward to like midnight when Dj #2 is gonna get on. He was only going to play for 45 minutes as a kind of transition from the first guys 140 bpm trap down to me being able to start with some moombah and work my way into the faster trap and dubstep stuff. Unfortunately like 20 minutes into his set the cops show up. One of the hosts goes outside for a few minutes and talks to the cop and we have to turn it down. Dj #2 got pissed though because he tried to keep playing when the cop arrived and someone killed the fader he was playing through on the main mixer(DJ #1's djm900) so as a result of him getting angry he said fuck it unplugged all his shit and set it back behind the booth somewhere. 

I hurried in pulled my laptop out plugged it in, got my S4 plugged in and had music going again no more than 5 minutes after the police had left. Unfortunately the vibe was totally dead now. The combination of the volume being turned down, police showing up, and dj #2 throwing a hissy fit bummed everyone out. I played as much popular music as I could but could only get 3 or 4 girls dancing and a few of the ghetto dudes screaming OOOHHHHH when I would play a song they got off to.  I had a bunch of people that kept asking for ""black people music"" so I'd let them look at my playlist of hip hop and rap, they'd pick a song I would play it they would keep coming back. Fucking annoying and dj #2 was supposed to keeping people from back behind me but he was off drinking himself into a stupor in a fit of anger. 

Anyways I got them off my back and got to play what I wanted for about 15 minutes or so and a guy comes up and wants to ""freestyle"". He was the hosts cousin or something so I was forced to oblige. He said he wanted a futuristic beat like dubstep to rap over. O.o I'm like da fuq?! so I give him a minimal house loop which he said he liked and he started trying to rap over 128 bpm house music. He lasted all of 30 seconds before he started getting boo'd and I said fuck it and played mercy because everyone likes that I guess and I needed to go in another direction asap. So he was pissed because I said it was a ""wack"" beat even though I had let him listen to it in my headphones before playing it and he said he liked it. Wtf.

After this is when shit really hits the fan. I got all the assholes out of the booth and was prepping another song when DJ #2 comes up and asks for me to hand him his laptop. I look behind me and his laptop and mixtrack pro are fucking gone. Literally just bare wall space where they'd been less than an hour before. He flipped shit. Dj #1 came up at this point and said to kill my music and lets find his shit. So I did but first I took all my stuff to the car because if someone was willing to steal once they'd do it again. I come back in to dj #1 playing fucking hardwell or something. He just wanted to play again and kinda tricked me into giving up my set. Whatever I'm over it. My ride home was dj #2 and when he gets pissy he's an asshole to everyone around him. I just wanted to get the fuck out of there without getting jacked. haha.

Whatever. we get the promoter to get on the mic and make an announcement. He offers a $50 gift card to a local club to anyone who finds the laptop at the very least. We stick around for maybe an hour after that trying to find the shit and it never shows. We say fuck it and while we're trying to turn around in his car to get out of there his car gets stuck in the mud with the tires spinning. Fuck. So I spend the next 30 minutes trying to get people outside to help push this dudes car out of the mud and we finally get a group of guys. it's like 4 a.m. now and dj #2 and I are pissy, covered in mud, and tired as hell. We stop at a gas station like 5 minutes from the party to call and report his gear as stolen. They say they'll dispatch an officer to our location. We sit there 45 fucking minutes and no one ever shows. We leave and like 10 minutes later get a call from the police asking where we are. He ended up having to drive all the way back across town the next day to meet the police to file the report I think.

Okay that whole last paragraph was just a rant about shit but whatever. the night was wack. I had a great time though even though the homies stuff is long gone. Wish I'd gotten to play more and hadn't gotten harassed so much to play rap. Whatever. awesome shit.

",14,2,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Beatmatch/comments/ze273/thanks_for_all_the_interest_yesterday_glad_to_see/,"So yesterday I posted that pretty popular thread about dj'ing for 15 years. One of the questions that popped up overnight in regards to one of the videos was why am I doing so much with the volume sliders on the mixer. I'm cutting and pasting my reply to that here so you guys can all see it cause it was hard to hear in the video. 

I'll make some more vids this weekend and post them here for you guys, so let me know what sort of stuff you'd like to see. I'll try to explain it best I can, and I'll try to record and sync the sound to the video in the future so you can hear better, but in the meantime here's my reply to what the volume fader allows you to do. A nice 2 1/2 minute mix from one track to the other. 

As for the fader thing, try this. I have another mix here -

http://soundcloud.com/djkennyfox/kenny-fox-live-8-26

Listen from 6 minutes on and try to hear what I'm doing. Keep in mind I'm just describing mixer controls and loops here, there's also a lot of tweaking of the eq's up above to tone down or bring in sounds but this may help you understand why I do lots of quick fader cuts. Listen closely for the following -

Track 1 is called shook up, playing at 6 minutes on. Track 2 is called pizzicato comes in during the breakdown of shook up. 

6:00 - shook up is playing by itself
6:20 - shook up's breakdown begins
6:34 - I begin using volume slams to add in a bass beat to the buildup of shook up. This happens till about 7:07
6:55 - really chopping up the bass beats of pizzicato you can hear the adding in best here because it's slightly off
7:07 - both tracks are now playing
@7:49 or close - begin using a couple bass cutouts, when shook up has a cool little 4 beat section I cut pizzicato so you're only hearing shook up again for 4 beats
8:27 - catch shook up in a one beat slip loop. When loop cuts out after looping part, slip loop put the track to where it should have been if u had never looped
8:35 or so - fade shook up out as pizzicato builds
9:03 - only pizzicato playing. 

Keep in mind I've been using loops to extend the mix the entire time, but it's a two and a half minute mix. Not just a fader cross. 


Follow me on soundcloud if you like my shit, just went pro so will try to e putting up a lot more mixes and some original tracks as well. And if you have a question about something you hear in a mix ask I'm happy to explain.

Welcome to the Weekly Mix Feedback thread on r/beatmatch!  This is the thread where you post your DJ mixes and ask other people to give you feedback.  Mix posts that are not in this thread will be removed.  If you submit your mix, please take the time to listen to some other submissions, especially if they play a style of music you're interested in.  These threads can't work if you don't participate.


These threads are intended for beginning DJs who are honestly looking for feedback or critique on their technique, selection, transitions, etc.  If you are an established DJ who is just looking for more followers/listens on your new mix or have a podcast/radio show, please post it to a more appropriate place such as /r/mixes or a genre-specific subreddit.   This subreddit is aimed at helping new DJs learn and is not the place to promote yourself!   

Rules:

* Please include the genre(s) of your mix.  This helps attract DJs/listeners of the same genre(s) who are likely to provide more useful feedback.  You might also include a title/length.

* [Mixcloud](http://www.mixcloud.com) is the preferred place to post mixes.  It allows you to include your tracklist and transition times, allows unlimited uploads, and is generally more geared towards DJs.  If you don’t want to use Mixcloud, be sure to include a tracklist.  

* Please ask for specific feedback or list parts of the mix you liked/didn’t like.  Hopefully you are looking for input on specific tracks or transitions.   Feel free to also link to a few instances where you provided someone else good feedback.  Being active in these threads should encourage more people to listen to your mix.

[Spek](http://spek.cc)

Essentially you can plug your songs into this program, and it will analyze them for you, essentially pointing out the lower bit rate songs for you. Check out the site briefly, and you'll see it's pretty straightforward. Basically lower quality songs will have a defined cut off in their frequency range. Although this program isn't fool proof, I found it very useful since I just found a ton of old CDs cleaning out some old rooms at my parents house. I quickly found that basically everything I had was low quality rips that I didn't want in my library.

Did a quick search and didn't see this posted here, or even in the other subreddits that I frequent, so I figured I'd pass it along.

While most of the night it wasn't real DJing, I couldn't have done it without /r/beatmatch",22,11,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/Beatmatch/comments/15egpq/i_djed_my_first_dance_on_saturday_night_while/,"Thanks to all of you. A lot has been learned these past few months and i'd like to share my experience

So about five months ago [I posted this in this subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/Beatmatch/comments/wbaym/urgent_newbie_needs_to_be_able_to_perform_in_five/), looking for direction. The TL;DR of it was basically that I had to DJ for a niche audience by December and I had no idea what I was doing. You guys helped a lot there, and sent me the right way

Through the next five months, whenever I had the time I studied DJing, figuring out not only what I would need to know for the dance, but also where I would need to go after that. I looked up tutorials on youtube, djtechtools, and I would quite often come across tips from people asking the same questions here that I was wondering myself. Whenever I got stuck I would ask a question here or in some of the other djing/production subreddits, and you guys were always quick to point me in the right direction

[This is a picture of me at the dance.](http://i.imgur.com/bQIRE.jpg) For anyone confused, i'm dressed up as the character [Dave Strider](http://i.imgur.com/BLpBM.png) from the webcomic Homestuck, because in the comic Dave is a DJ/Producer and the dance was for the local homestuck fandom. [Here's another picture that clearly shows I wasn't mixing live](http://i.imgur.com/G64cS.jpg)

The ""DJing"" schtick was more just a way to add to the atmosphere of the night, but I did in fact mix a set. Since (as explained in my post five months ago) they all wanted Homestuck music but Homestuck music isn't good dance music, I used Ableton Live in order to layer the songs on top of breakdowns and choruses and transitions in stuff, so there was no way I could screw up.

At least, that was the plan.

As it turns out, I didn't actually have to layer homestuck songs overtop, rendering Ableton live pointless for the dance (but still a great learning experience overall). In fact, when I ran out of pre-mixed sets (I had only mixed 3 and a half hours), I used my APC40 with Traktor Pro to perform the last bit of the night live, ending with Mariah Carey's All I Want is You. When I wasn't using traktor, all I was doing was just layering on effects (not TOO heavily, just every now and then) and pressing buttons/twiddling knobs that were macroed to nothing in order to fool anyone watching.

----------------------------------
**anyways** *(if you're disappointed by anything you've read skip to this part)*

----------------------------------
What I got out of this night was people having lots of fun. A song would come up and everyone would light up and yell ""OH MY GOD IT'S THIS SONG!!!"" They'd sing along, they'd clap to the beat (sometimes started by me), they'd dance, they'd socialize, they loved it. And I loved it.

For the next dance the local fandom has, i'm not gonna be hiding behind the safety of a pre-mixed ableton set. I'm gonna save up for a more suitable controller and i'm gonna be watching the crowd, putting on the right song at the right moment and making everybody go crazy. I'm gonna learn to beatmatch. I'm gonna improve my tracklist. I'm gonna do this all not because I want to be popular or anything, but because I love the feel of feeding people music and them having a good time as a result. **I love DJing.**

The scariest part of the night was pressing play. The rest was just fun.

I couldn't have done this without the help and support of everyone in this subreddit. You guys are awesome. Merry Christmas.

But I promised myself I'd learn to beatmatch before I started experimenting with effects and mappings and other advanced stuff. And I don't know what I was expecting, but fuck, this is hard. Day 2 it takes me anywhere from 2-10 minutes to get the beats in phase and the BPM's matched up. I have to use loops so that I don't run out of song to practice with.

Here's what I'm doing to practice: loading the same track in both decks A and B, creating a small looped section of an easy-to-work-with part (like an intro that is just bass and kicks, for example), cueing up deck B in my headphones and looping, just like deck A, then moving the pitch slider gently back and forth until it sounds like the two are matched and in sync.

Here's my issue: when I'm moving the pitch slider, I have no idea what I'm doing (I'm doing my best to not look at the screen so that I have to learn to beatmatch without waveforms or BPM's or phasemeters). It feels like I'm basically just stumbling around in a dark room until I trip over a synced beat, quite on accident. I've read this subreddit for about a month so pardon me if this is asked to death, but is this right? 

I've seen a number of videos about pitch-riding and beatmatching basics, but everything I've seen thus far has made it look wayyy easy. So far I've just had a whole lot of trainwrecked beats and frustration and it feels like I'm going nowhere.

UPDATE: Success! Following a few of the suggestions in this thread and elsewhere I started practicing tonight and after a bit of fiddling around fruitlessly, managed to beatmatch two tracks pretty well according to my own ears.

Thank you for all your useful help during these past months!

I've ""dj:ed"" since december and I recently bought my second controller, a traktor S2 (and I'm really satisfied with it). I'm learning to beatmatch by ear and it is going pretty well. I'm getting a hand of it atleast.  

Well, the reason why I came here is to ask you, well,  more like telling you my story:

I recently decided to do a new mix (so I can get some feedback etc), and I started to pick songs and listening to them thoroughly. But now that I got a Traktor S2 I can make use of the cuepoints that Traktor provides. But even though I've only used them for one day (when i looked through the songs and placed them in order in a playlist etc), I got bored of them. 

**Might it be that I'm not using them with efficience yet (due to me only being a sprout in this business)? ** 

I just use these cuepoints to know where to start the next song; a cuepoint in the end of the song is like a flag that tells me ""in 4 beats you should press start on the other song"". And then I got another cuepoint as the starting point of the other song (before a ""drop"" for example). 

When I recorded my mix I just sat, watched and waited for the minutemarker (word?) to reach the cuepoint so I could stat the next song. This didn't really bring any joy to me, even though it was sometimes hard to beatmatch, EQ and rais the volume at the same time. I guess that I prefer to just choose a couple of songs and mix them together by ear and with the guts, it makes me get that little nervous feeling and that adrenaline that makes your whole body tickle.
 
----

TL:DR; so my real question to you guys is; should I just wait and train some more and then start learning how to use cuepoints properly, or is using cuepoints a whole other system of mixing/beatmatching?

1368606110.0,11,self.Beatmatch,1edex9,Some advice for people looking to get into DJing and score a residency.,15,4,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/Beatmatch/comments/1edex9/some_advice_for_people_looking_to_get_into_djing/,"tl;dr: make friends with the DJs, sooner or later you will get a chance. Make sure you have ssl or are familiar with whatever equipment they use and can pull off a decent mix.

---------------------------------
I'm a resident DJ at a club and due to people quitting and availability I'm DJing by myself 1 sometimes 2 nights a week. DJing alone for 6 hours sucks like you can't imagine. 

The only person i know, who i've met at the club, can't even mix on the outros. I got him to open for me for a 50$ tab and am teaching him and giving him music just so i don't have to dj 6 hrs straight. If i knew anyone half decent that i got along with and wouldn't mind working with, he'd have a job.

I know at least 1-2 other DJs in my position and i know it happens. Go out, make friends with the DJs, mention you know how to mix, don't hound them for a spot, just casually tell them if they ever need someone to open, you'd gladly help out to learn from them.

Trust me, if there's an opening. The resident DJs have first say in who gets it, the manager doesn't know jack shit about DJing and any guests we have that could potentially be hired, he asks us what we think.

The guy i have right now only knows how to DJ using serato itch, a controller and sync (We use turntables with ssl), he also wants to play the latest electro at 8pm...  Make sure you know how to DJ on turntables/CDjs and make sure you have serato scratch live with a good library. Understand what you need to play for opening etc.. Every club in my city uses serato scratch live, except a few EDM places which only use CDjs. If you own a serato box, it literally takes 2 min to set it up and go about your set. 

I know other, better DJs who want a spot at my club, but they're generally self absorbed assholes who think they're god's gift to music. I would rather teach this guy and get him to the point where he can land the job than give it to someone i don't like as a person and be forced to put up with.

-----

For good DJs looking for a main spot. Make sure you don't come with a 200$ controller and a laptop. If you're not dedicated to buying proper hardware, generally it is assumed you're not that experienced or good. I'm not gonna waste my time pulling cables out of the back of a mixer for someone to do a shitty job and have to kick them off after 10 min of rubbish. I only know one DJ using tracktor, he brings about 1k worth of equipment and he does a great job. Other than that, every good DJ i know is using turntables or CDjs -- generally with ssl.

**edit on controllers**


Paying $2000 vs $200 is much more of a commitment that less people are willing to make. Generally those who do, are more serious about it. I know plenty of people who bought a controller to play around for shits and giggles, i don't know anyone who spent heavy money to play around. The odds of finding someone good who uses turntables are higher because the rate of people who are serious from that group is much higher. I'm not saying that by using turntables, you're better. I've seen a guy DJing with only a sample-board and tracktor with 4 decks and he did an awesome job. I've also seen people with turntables who think they can scratch and made everyone's ears bleed. 

Hope this helps some of the guys out there trying to get in. Make friends and know what you're doing. Keep showing up at the club and it will happen for sure.

I know most people in here focus on electronic music, but I was wondering if anyone has experience spinning funk and soul tunes and could provide some insight into good mixing techniques for these genres?  

I tend to focus on mixing hip-hop and trip-hop style tunes, but lately I've really been getting into some of the older funk and soul crates and have been trying my hand at mixing those.  I've noticed that it's really hard to phase the outro from one song into the intro of another because the kick and snares aren't as predictable, and there are often other vocals, horns, or something that clash with the two tunes.  So when mixing these genres, as a rule of thumb do you usually wait until the last bar of the tune to start bringing in your next one as opposed to other genres where you'll have two tunes playing for 4, 16, or more bars?

Also, I've noticed that a lot of the songs I've compiled to try to mix have BPMs which are all over the place (75-95ish).  Is it unreasonable to hope to incorporate all of the tunes with varying BPMs into the same mix, or is this something where I'd have to build my mix based on ascending or descending BPMs?

Thanks for the help, and if anyone has any other advice in terms of mixing techniques (good cue points, juggling ideas, blending the genres with other genres, etc., that would be greatly appreciated).

Now onto the January challenge!  This month we challenge beatmatchers to work on blending 2 tracks together, and we figure the best way to do that is LONG MIXING.

Each song must be mixed with the previous/next song for at least a minute and a half.

Here are this month's rules:

 * Your mix can be no longer than 15 minutes, no exceptions
 * You must post your mix to mixcloud and you must tag transition times and songs
 * Each song must be mixed with adjacent songs for a minute and a half.  Please tag the end of the transition on mixcloud, and post the beginning of each transition (when you first put audio from the new track into the master channel) in your reply
 * Mashups don't count as mixing
 * Submissions close at 10 PM Pacific Time on Thursday, January 24th.

Voting thread will be posted shortly after submissions close.

Have fun!  We're still looking for more ideas for future MotM challenges.  If you have any ideas for the challenge, or for the subreddit in general, please let us know!

Not sure if I'm in the right subreddit for this question, but nonetheless I hope you can help me.
On Saturday I'm playing a one hour set at a big event, I'm probably going to be the closing DJ. I've done a few of these but this time, for some reason, I can't decide what song to start with.. So I'm asking, does anyone recommend any good intro mix's that are around at the moment? Want it to be the usual electro house track, can be a bit trancey, the more well known the better (can be a mashup). 

Any recommended songs would be highly appreciated. My favourite part of the set is the intro, and I always try to have a huge intro track to get everyone going. One's I've used in the past include [Digitalism - Circles (Eric Prydz Remix)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9e5RzF84zbw) and [Pryda &amp; Empire Of The Sun - We are the Mirage (Roman Kay Intro Bootleg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfBeBoRzSyY). These are just two examples I can think of.. Hope you get the idea! 

Right now, I'm thinking of using [Arty - Zara (Carlos G Intro Mix)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwHS3Cszfqs) or even something like [Swedish House Mafia - Greyhound](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBRKSIj2tMc) - However chances are a DJ before me will have played this so I'd like something a bit more..

I hope the community continues to grow and thrive. It's great seeing all the helpful people here. We're approaching our one-month aniversary, which is fantastic; many new subreddits would have bitten the dust by now or resigned themselves to being wastelands.

Anyway, what I thought I'd talk about real quick is posting on r/BM, and some guidelines. (Not rules)

Back in October, there were few enough posts that people were able to sit down, and listen to each mix and give thoughtful critique. This is no longer the case; evidence of this is that the top 10 posts are either self.beatmatch posts or links to external resources. 

Many of the mixes posted here are upwards of 30 minutes long, and it really is hard to sit down and listen to a mix for even 1/2 that if you're as busy as many of us (I'm sure) are. It's not bad that people are posting mixes, but you will learn more by bringing up specific issues about your mix or doing a shorter mix. However, don't let that discourage you from posting, just be aware that most people are more likely to comment on a self.bm post or a short mix where you explain what you're looking for in the title.

For example, if I was posting a trance mix where I used some new samples and tried some manual beatmatching in traktor (which you should do), I would title it appropriately, maybe 

* 
""Trance - Manual beatmatching critique?"" 

Conversely, if I had a smooth electro mix, it might be something like 

* 
""Electro - attempting gradual transitions.""

Also, use Mixcloud if you can, and at least Soundcloud. YouTube videos are too low quality and many people aren't willing to download a 200 mb file of your mix, unfortunately. It's easy and free, and it has a good tracklisting feature.

I've been a casual lurker for a little while, and have finally reached a point where I'm finally so frustrated with the current trajectory of my life that I'm creating an account and asking for help. (As this is supposed to be DJ help and not self-help I'll try to keep psychology out of this as much as possible, but it plays a role.)

I love EDM and electronic music of all kinds. Like many of you here, I'm sure, it picks me up when I'm down and keeps me going through tough times. And when I'm already happy, forget it; it's pure sonic euphoria!

Anyway, it's been a fantasy of mine for a while to become a DJ. I truly want to become a DJ for the love of the music, not for the fame or status it may grant me, or for the money (which aren't bad motivations, they're just not for me).

I've watched videos, I've read tutorials, I've even invested in some rudimentary equipment in order to try to make a stab at it (Numark Mixtrack Pro). The problem is, I struggle with crippling social anxiety and depression, and get overwhelmed easily when there is so much information out there it's difficult to know where to begin. (I'm slowly receiving treatment for these conditions, but it's slow going)

Anyways, I'm wondering if anyone else was in the same boat I find myself in, the desire to DJ but not the internal wherewithal to give it a go, and if so if you wouldn't mind sharing how you overcame it and built the confidence to let your sound be heard.

I apologize if this is a repost, but as I mentioned before I'm a casual lurker and not very good at redditing; I don't post very frequently. As you may have guessed, I made this account specifically for this post.

Thanks for reading and I hope you all keep spinning!

TL;DR - want to DJ, know there's a wealth of info out there, but anxiety and depression make it hard to take practical steps towards making the dream a reality. Any tips or methods you used to overcome a similar situation?

Edit 1 - 8/7/13 23:14 EST: Thanks everyone for your nice encouraging and motivational comments. :) I'll definitely take these thoughts into consideration as I pursue the dream.

Welcome to the Weekly Mix Feedback thread on r/beatmatch!  This is the thread where you post your DJ mixes and ask other people to give you feedback.  Mix posts that are not in this thread will be removed.  If you submit your mix, please take the time to listen to some other submissions, especially if they play a style of music you're interested in.  These threads can't work if you don't participate.


These threads are intended for beginning DJs who are honestly looking for feedback or critique on their technique, selection, transitions, etc.  If you are an established DJ who is just looking for more followers/listens on your new mix or have a podcast/radio show, please post it to a more appropriate place such as /r/mixes or a genre-specific subreddit.   This subreddit is aimed at helping new DJs learn and is not the place to promote yourself!   

Rules:

* Please include the genre(s) of your mix.  This helps attract DJs/listeners of the same genre(s) who are likely to provide more useful feedback.  You might also include a title/length.

* [Mixcloud](http://www.mixcloud.com) is the preferred place to post mixes.  It allows you to include your tracklist and transition times, allows unlimited uploads, and is generally more geared towards DJs.  If you don’t want to use Mixcloud, be sure to include a tracklist.  

* Please ask for specific feedback or list parts of the mix you liked/didn’t like.  Hopefully you are looking for input on specific tracks or transitions.   Feel free to also link to a few instances where you provided someone else good feedback.  Being active in these threads should encourage more people to listen to your mix.

1371755218.0,10,self.Beatmatch,1gqu7w,Making an Impression - Why Stage Presence is Important,10,0,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/Beatmatch/comments/1gqu7w/making_an_impression_why_stage_presence_is/,"The ability to perform is one of the most understated skills that a DJ can have.  I play out quite often and stage presence is one of the first things I notice in a DJ.

So what is stage presence exactly?  Well to put it simply it's your ability to connect with people and put a ""face"" to the music.  Freddie Mercury, Frank Sinatra, Michael Jackson, Prince - these are all guys with incredible charisma on stage.  They don't just sing their songs, they OWN them.  They convince you that there's no one on this planet who can deliver their song better than they can.

Now fine.  ""But these guys are singers,"" you're probably saying.  ""I'm a DJ, I play other people's records.  I don't 'deliver' anything"".

Fun fact - some of the most renowned DJs today have great stage presence.  I personally get a lot out of watching guys like Carl Cox, Skrillex, Gesaffelstein, Araabmusik... I'm sure there's plenty of good examples.  Now a lot of that doesn't necessarily have to do with their music.  I don't enjoy Skrillex in the studio too much but his concerts are totally nuts.  And yes, he has a million dollars worth of visuals and lights and stuff, but anyway...

Stage presence is important and it will help you stand out from the 20 other DJs (who are just as capable) that don't have it.  That's the bottom line.

So how does one get a stage presence?  


**Step 1: Know what you are doing** 

It goes without saying that you have to be very good at what you do before you can even think about what you look like.  I can say from personal experience that thinking about your mixing, transitions and stuff becomes twice as hard when you're worried about pumping the crowd up.  But on the other hand there are performers who can put their game face on and engage people without even thinking about it.  Either way, becoming a ""natural"" beatmatcher and mixer and becoming a ""natural"" performer are things that take lots and lots of practice.  So be ready for that.


**Step 2: Believe in yourself**

If you don't have confidence it can be very difficult to look like you do.  Maybe you're Michael Cera, and your stage presence is based around being really awkward.  But that can be hard to pull off in a way which appeals to people.  When I DJ I have to convince myself that I'm god's gift to music.  That doesn't mean I come across as a cocky asshole on stage but it allows for a lot more of my personality to come through.


**Step 3: Connect with people**

You are a DJ.  You are playing music FOR PEOPLE.  If you pretend your audience doesn't exist 90% of the time they'll pay a lot less attention to you.  Aphex Twin is the only performer I've seen who can pull off the arrogant, ""I'm too good for you"" act and still get people dancing.  So look at people!  Make eye contact with your audience.  It helps them loosen up and encourages them to come onto the floor and connect with you.  

Now these 3 tips aren't the be-all and end-all but they're a really good starting point for building your stage presence.  Have fun with it - recognize that what works for some DJs or genre of music won't work well for others.  Good luck and let me know if you think there's anything I should add!",,False,self,t5_2syix,False,,,True,t3_1gqu7w,http://www.reddit.com/r/Beatmatch/comments/1gqu7w/making_an_impression_why_stage_presence_is/,

So, I've been playing around with the free, open-source DJing program Mixxx for about 3 or 4 months now. I don't really have a huge liking for electronic music, but I know it's massively popular for DJs nowadays; as a result I listen to it, and occasionally play around with it (mixing, playing with cues, beatmatching, etc.). But I really love hip-hop/R&amp;B music (90s-present). I'd love to spin it and mix it, but I'm kinda lost on where to begin. So could anyone help narrow my options?

Also, as previously stated, I use Mixxx as my DJ software. And I have no controller yet, but I plan on buying a Numark DJ 2 GO Portable USB Controller. (insufficient funds at the moment). So I solely use my laptop (no ""good"" speakers either). I don't really plan on playing gigs anytime soon as well. I'm just trying to slowly learn DJing, while having fun.

I support him a lot, but there are a lot of gut leconcerns I have as a producer about his improvement on performances. For instance, I've noticed that he kinda tends towards the fist-pumping 128 BPM songs a lot. I've seen him start trying to mix drum and bass and then default to Knife Party tracks when he has trouble beatmatching.

I think it's because he doesn't really make an effort to plan any of his mixes. I mean, don't DJs create a setlist of songs to play at certain times? He's great at improv and quick fixes, so it's just a matter of coming up with a small setlist and working with it, more or less, depending on where you hit your cues right? I mean how many good DJs just spin whatever they have in their playlist without a blueprint or a plan?

I'm asking this here because I know it takes planning and time to deliver a good performance, but maybe I'm wrong.

The Serato  layout was a bit messy for me when browsing the library, so I never got the handle of it. VDJ track preview is better than Traktor, in my opinion. Instead of having load the song in to the preview player, wait for it to load &amp; then preview the track; in VDJ I just press the preview button &amp; scroll a bunch of songs until I find something which I feel will mix in with the current song.

The thing which I've found odd about VDJ is when I enable an effect and turn down the volume level, the effect also disappears. But when I do the same in Traktor the effect can still be heard giving a smoother mix &amp; not giving a feel as if something had disappeared. Does anyone know how I can achieve the same effect in VDJ as I would in Traktor?

I'm lucky enough to be working in bar as a waiter and started Djing once a week for the past 6 months. I play mostly vinyl, while I help myself with the Dj booth's computer. I do  normaly 5 hour shifts and play just about everything: hip-hop, jazz, nu-jazz, soul, funk, RnB, electro swing, broken beat, break beat and reggae... But no house, i'm really not into techno. 

So you can imagine that beatmatching jazz and funk is a no go unless you're really really fucking good. So most of the time my job consists of reading the crowds mood and just fading in and out songs.

I'd say i have a pretty good reception from the my colleagues (waiters) and the clients. Every shift they come and see me to tell me that they loved my set. 

But i feel like i'm stalling or missing something, I've been reading alot of stuff on r/djs and r/beatmatch, but it seems the largest part of the community plays techno/house/dubstep. I'd like to find some advice on mixes for versatile djs... cause some time i feel like a human itunes that fades in and out. I could probably just put my mixcloud mixes on and sit at the bar for the whole evening. 

Should i try to always beatmatch between Earth wind and fire and A tribe called Quest?? 
Should i drop songs on breaks instead of fade in/out as often as i can? 
How do you transition smoothly from one style to another? 

Hey, any input would is good... just looking for good old friendly advice to make me a better dj.

However i have not much of a clue where to start with the effects. In traktor there are soooo many, does any who is experienced using them and have any top tips? Which ones do you use most? And in single or group? When in your mix's and how often? 

I cant help but play with them and i know i am using them too much but i feel a bit like a kid in a sweet shop.

1355794837.0,11,self.Beatmatch,150zel,I created a spreadsheet to keep track of my music and thought it could help some Beatmatch DJ's.,13,2,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/Beatmatch/comments/150zel/i_created_a_spreadsheet_to_keep_track_of_my_music/,"I've created a spreadsheet in Excel with the following fields: Track, Artist, BPM, Key, Genre, Energy Level, 3 spaces for songs that mix well together, and a space for notes.

All of the columns above are able to be filtered to include or exclude any selection that you may want.  Say you're working on a techno mix for a gig where you are the opener.  You decide that you really only want to play techno so you filter out all house, dubstep, and electro tracks that you may have.  Next you want to select appropriate tempos for your set so you choose all songs with a BPM range 124 to 128.  Now your track selection is looking pretty good but you still have a few bangers in there that would be inappropriate for your set time.  So you filter the energy level to only include songs with a low or mid energy level.  Now you're ready to get your groove on.  During your set if you need to find a song in C#m you can filter to only show songs in that or whatever keys you like.

All columns are able to be sorted from big to small, A to Z, etc.  You are also able to search any of the fields directly to find, say, a song without scrolling or going through endless filters.  I've also included a spot that calculates the average BPM of whatever BPMs you have filtered.  If you have your whole library open it tells the average BPM of all your tunes.  If you only have banging dubstep tracks selected it changes to show only the selected ranges BPM.  Maybe this could be used to pick a good set tempo.  Also, anything new that you add to any field will be filterable or searchable after it's entered.  So when you add new artists or genres, etc. you can filter or search for it without doing anything extra.

It was a chill party which would have a lot of freshmen and probably no dance floor so I just brought my laptop equipped with Traktor. When I got there they sat me at a table and I felt like I was tabling at a fair or something. There was a 2.1 computer speaker system which was fine; I wasn't expecting anything better. I started off playing some lower BPM (~100) tunes and felt alright. 

One of the party hosts who I didn't know too well immediately started requesting stuff which would have been all very well if she wasn't so patronizing about it. She asked ""Don't you have X?"" to which I responded that I had a set list prepared and everything. To this she said ""Well, don't you have Spotify?"" which made me realize that she had just expected me to show up with an iTunes playlist. So I grumbled and flashed the Traktor GUI (because let's be real, it looks pretty fucking impressive) and she left me alone and I kept going, but when I gradually increased the BPM, people started swaying a bit but I was really frustrated because everyone just seemed super awkward (freshmen!) and more like they were preoccupied with impressing each other than having fun.

The computer speakers didn't reach to the living room (I was in the dining room/kitchen area, where all the booze was, which was a little annoying because kitchen lights are so bright) so another friend of mine started playing music (shitty Top 40) off his laptop there. I got kind of offended so I went to talk to him and he said ""Sorry! I put this on because when I walked in they were playing Linkin Park..."" I asked him if I could move to the living room because that was where more people seemed to be congregating, so I did, but still no one seemed affected by my music.

My friend had moved his Top 40 back to the kitchen, and after 20 minutes or so, I went to see him, and several people seemed to be actually dancing to it! There was even a painfully awkward freshman couple grinding. At this point I got kind of pissed off and just left the party because it was a lame party and I wasn't getting paid anyway. At least a couple people seemed disappointed that I was leaving.

Oh well. Better luck next time? D:

If anything I'll use your responses as a guide as to what I'll try to research next. Also, I plan on just fiddling around with some of the free djing software out there atm. 

Among the questions I have, the biggest/most important are probably
1) What do people consider a mix
2) What techniques do I need to employ (such as beatmatching, but what else is there that I'll need to learn)
3) What are samples/loops and how are they used in mixes
4) What would you suggest are the most important aspects of a mix that make it successful?

Welcome to the Weekly Mix Feedback thread on r/beatmatch!  This is the thread where you post your DJ mixes and ask other people to give you feedback.  Mix posts that are not in this thread will be removed.  If you submit your mix, please take the time to listen to some other submissions, especially if they play a style of music you're interested in.  These threads can't work if you don't participate.


These threads are intended for beginning DJs who are honestly looking for feedback or critique on their technique, selection, transitions, etc.  If you are an established DJ who is just looking for more followers/listens on your new mix or have a podcast/radio show, please post it to a more appropriate place such as /r/mixes or a genre-specific subreddit.   This subreddit is aimed at helping new DJs learn and is not the place to promote yourself!   

Rules:

* Please include the genre(s) of your mix.  This helps attract DJs/listeners of the same genre(s) who are likely to provide more useful feedback.  You might also include a title/length.

* [Mixcloud](http://www.mixcloud.com) is the preferred place to post mixes.  It allows you to include your tracklist and transition times, allows unlimited uploads, and is generally more geared towards DJs.  If you don’t want to use Mixcloud, be sure to include a tracklist.  

* Please ask for specific feedback or list parts of the mix you liked/didn’t like.  Hopefully you are looking for input on specific tracks or transitions.   Feel free to also link to a few instances where you provided someone else good feedback.  Being active in these threads should encourage more people to listen to your mix.

Unfortunately, I didn't record the set because I'm still not sure how, but it went well minus the bar's sound system going into protect mode a couple times. 

The first time it went into protect mode, the sound cut out and was totally gone. I was shitting bricks checking all my connections, and making sure nothing was unplugged. I'm assuming their system shuts off to protect itself from blowing anything or over heating, because I turned the receiver off and back on, then turned down the levels a bit and it worked like a charm. The second and third time it happened, I was trying to make the drop in the last song louder, and my plan backfired :( But thanks to all of you encouraging each other how to troubleshoot gear, I was able to get back and running without the manager helping me with the unfamiliar sound system :)

Not gonna lie, I was kinda nervous before I went on. I set my gear up, pulled up the first song, hit play, and let it roll. I kind of had the nervous shakes for the first few minutes, but the manager (also my boss because I work there), brought me a drink and it helped loosen me up. Another one from a coworker who was there to party, and the shakes were gone for good! I started mixing at about 10:30 or 11, and went until 2am when the bar closed.

I think I mostly understand the theory of it, except a couple things:

1. What exactly is 'Pitch', sometimes I hear it talked about as if it means the tempo of a song, and other times as if it means the frequency (how high/low pitched it sounds). I understand that a pitch control can sometimes alter both, and sometimes just the tempo (say if you use the 'keylock' in traktor). But how do you tell what exactly someone means when they say 'pitch'?

2. Say you have two tracks and you've adjusted the tempos to be v.close to eachother, as far as i'm aware it's almost impossible to get them exactly the same manually. So that means even if you start them playing on the same beat, they'll eventually start to go out of sync. So I get that you're supposed to hear when one record is skipping ahead a bit and adjust it by pushing it forward/backwards a bit to line them back up, but how do you do that DURING a mix without the audience hearing the 'galloping' beats. Or are you just supposed to line it up perfectly before you start mixing and hope to finish the mix before the difference in tempos becomes apparent?

So I'm a DJ and I'm **participating in a local DJ Contest**. So I thought what's the harm in sending my Mixtape... I decided to send a Deep House mixtape, cause if you win you get a spot to warm-up at a local party. You won't play really banging music when warming-up will you...

Apparently in order to get into the live DJ contest you have to get Mixcloud favorites. The five DJ's with most **favorites on Mixcloud** get to play at the live DJ contest.

Now I wouldn't mind losing to a better mixtape. But there are even mixtapes in there with more favorites than mine, without being properly beatmatched... Listen to the transition from ""Otto Knows - Million Voices"" to ""Somebody that I used to Know (Tiësto Remix)"". He's clearly **double beating** there.

http://www.mixcloud.com/orangeblue2003/sound-of-ob-dj-dtn-dieter-vanslambrouck/ 

If you check out the user that uploaded that mix, the host of the contest. Check out some other mixes and their tracklists. Fairly un-original tracklists if you ask me...

**So I'm kinda losing this DJ/Favorite contest now to people with the most cliché tracklists ever, and a guy that can't even properly beatmatch...**

**TL;DR**
I think it's a shame if those people would go to the next round of the contest. That's why I'm asking reddit, if you guys like my mixtape, to favourite it on Mixcloud...

For the love of DJ'ing and House music...

PS: I would really appreciate some **feedback** on my mixtape so I can improve in the future!

",9,2,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/Beatmatch/comments/x2a1r/a_question_regarding_mixing_with_only_your/,"Hello /r/Beatmatch! Hope you're all well.

I have a question about mixing, I'm unsure if it's better to post here or to /r/DJs. Nonetheless:

I'm thankfully at the stage now where I'm DJing at a few more venues these days, whether it be small clubs to actual 'events' in Marquees etc. Now, a lot of the time I don't have a booth monitor. (For those that don't know, where-ever you find a set of DJ decks, you tend to find what's called a 'booth monitor'. This is simply a speaker in your DJ booth which is used when you're mixing, so that you can more accurately hear what the mix sounds like).

Now, a lot of the time, I oddly find myself in the situation where I rarely have a booth monitor.. I've played in one club with a booth monitor, and at one other event. Every other time, I've not had one. This isn't necessarily a problem, but as many DJs will understand, it sounds reaaalllyyy weird when you're DJing behind club speakers or when your booth is far away from the speakers. 
So, I have a question regarding headphone mixing. I have Sennheiser HD-25s, which are absolutely fantastic. Best headphones I've ever had.. As a result, in these situations, I tend to always keep my headphones on and not monitor at all. This is pretty bad isn't it? Is it possible that when I'm mixing purely on my headphones, it can sound good on my headphones but awful on a bigger sound system? 
Is the best way to judge just by simply listening to the 'weird' mixing behind the speakers?

I hope experienced DJs understand me when I say it sounds odd mixing from a different angle compared to the actual speakers!

I'm not sure what common practice is with buildups and drops between 2 songs, but Often times I'll find myself wanting to drop Song B after the Buildup of Song A. However, the 'mashup' is quite a bit more enjoyable and smooth if Song B is building up at the same time as song A. This way you are hearing elements from both songs.

My problem is I can never figure out how to line this up perfectly without planning out the entire buildup and drop ahead of time. I'll always start a measure or two off on accident, and then one song drops early and it just doesn't go as planned. Do you have any tips on timing things like this easily that I am able to do on the fly. Maybe Cue point tips? 
I use Traktor with the S2 Controller. and yes, I do count in my head. I just find it difficult to find where the 8, 16, or 32 bar buildup starts without going to the drop and counting backwards. Which is something I can only really do for the song that isn't currently playing anyways.

I don't think i'll be good at all by December, but I need to be able to hold a crowd by then. Lemme explain myself**

------------

So a little while ago this group i was with was holding a party. I don't know if any of you read homestuck but this group (of over 400 members) is based around that comic, and they decided to hold a dance. The person who organized it rented out some speakers and a mixer from Long and McQuade, and then hooked it up to her laptop and set all the homestuck music on shuffle. [Here's an example of homestuck music.](http://homestuck.bandcamp.com/) Now, if any of you guys listened to a song or two there, you probably didn't hit the &lt;10% of the songs that are decent at a dance, and probably hit the other &gt;90% that kind of kill the mood. Seeing this, i jumped onto the laptop and played music from my ipod and watched the crowd. I played fast dance music when the energy was building, slow when i saw people getting romantic, fillers when people were out taking a breather, etc. Basically i was a shitty DJ, but better than leaving homestuck music on shuffle. There was speculation that there would be another dance in the winter, and I would love it if i could prevent another problem like this from occurring. 

--------

My plan is to learn how to be a semi-decent DJ by December and use ableton live and a MIDI pad controller to create an awesome time for everyone involved. I am serious about DJing in general, and i'm hoping to learn enough to use it as a side job later on in life, but for now I just need to know enough to perform on my own. [This is the MIDI pad controller i plan on getting, if i'm still serious about this in a few months.](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001T9O60Q/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?ie=UTF8&amp;m=ATVPDKIKX0DER)

--------

**What i know (or think i know)**

I can count beats. I can follow the Camelot wheel. [I've made a shitty mashup with the worst ending ever.](http://www.thebackalleys.com/dump/player.php?f=9692) I've been messing around in virtualDJ but i want to switch over to Ableton Live 8. I've been doing a lot of tutorials in Ableton to figure out the program, but i'm having a problem putting things together. I've been at this for two weeks trying to find information on the internet and studying mashups on [mashupbreakdown.com](http://mashupbreakdown.com) but I feel like it would be a lot faster if you guys just pointed me in the right direction. I've got Ableton live 8 and an Oxygen 49 MIDI keyboard my friend isn't using.

--------

So here's what I need. I need to know how I can move forward, what I need to learn, any good tutorials on DJing and mashups, anything i should know about ableton, basically all the info I can get. Maybe a critique on my shitty mashup if you'd be so kind :]

Finally here are a few questions that have been bumping around my head:

1: Why are there sometimes two people at the DJ stand? What does the second guy do?

2: What are some good sites for instrumentals and/or acapellas? I know about acapellas4u but that's about it

3: How do I transition to songs with different keys or tempos?

4: How do i transition songs in general

5: [Is this legit at all? It seems legit](http://www.digitaldjtips.com/how-to-digital-dj-fast-cb/)


**TL;DR I need to be a shitty DJ by december and hopefully get better after that, what do i need to do?**

Welcome to all the new people who have discovered this sub recently and put it to over 1K readers, it's great seeing this community grow and the amount of helpful people is blowing my mind. There was a period where there were too many submissions to spend fair time on, but I think the amount of helpful people have completely flipped the tables and now almost every post gets some great critique. Awesome!

Now, there's been a lot of debate about posting mixes/other things. I see there being two options as far as moderation and submission policy goes, and I'd like to discuss these.

Option one: Mixes are no longer allowed as straight submissions. If you were to post a link to your soundcloud/mixcloud mix it would be removed. There would be a weekly feedback thread somewhat reminiscent of r/edmproduction's where we post comments with our mixes inside the thread.

The major downsides I see to this option are increased moderation and weekly feedback thread drama. In [/r/EDMproduction](/r/EDMproduction) people will occasionally downvote all posts but theirs so they gain more exposure. While this probably wouldn't happen in r/beatmatch, as we gain more readers, I do see it as an unfortunate possibility. As far as increased moderation, we would most likely need another moderator due to real life constraints of the current ones. Small issue, but w/e.

Option two: Keep it as is and allow mix submission. Purely self-promotional things will still be taken down, but other than that submission guidelines will remain as such: guidelines.

I'd appreciate it if you guys would throw in your thoughts down below.


Also, what should we call subscribers? Right now it's the default ""readers"" but I'm sure we can come up with something more hip than that.

Are you happy/unhappy with the moderation and direction of this subreddit? The spam filter is still a bit jinky so I remove stuff daily from it, but sometimes I miss legit things and it takes a bit longer for me to pass them through.

Now I have a million questions.,10,1,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/Beatmatch/comments/lbelz/first_beats_matched_now_i_have_a_million_questions/,"So I got the free version of VDJ and in about an 2 hours of poking around and watching youtube videos, I transitioned from one song to another overlaying the outro of one song to the intro of the next ""smoothly"". When I did this I giggled like a school girl with excitement, but I now have more questions than when I started.

To mix the 2 songs what I did was make an 8 beat loop of the second song. Then I started the 1st song. Then I matched the beats. At the end of the song I moved the slider to the middle to play the end of the 1st song and the beginning of the 2nd song at the same time. Then when the 1st song was over i slider to the right and opened the loop to only play the 2nd song. 

1) Is this what I am supposed to be doing? Is this correct?

2) With VDJ I understand there is only one output so I cannot listen to the ""Cue"". While recording something else. Is this correct?

3) I am correct in think that when I get my actual equipment that this wont really be an issue? Will I be able to listen to one thing and make the loop while the other song is still playing to the audience?

4) Is it good to learn with VDJ before buying equipment? Taking into account the questions above.

5) Are there any good youtube tutorials? Which do you reccomend?

6) What is the major difference between using the crossfader as opposed to using the 2 volume slides right 
above it?

7) Currently, I am practicing these techniques by just loading up any old songs that I want to listen to, setting a loop for the song I want to play next, then just doing my best to match and play smoothly, even if I am just cutting from one song directly to another as long as the beat is constant. Is this good? Is this what I should be doing to practice?

8) After getting down the previous questions, what would you recommend as the next step?

9a) On several videos that I watched, I saw that some people had 3 cross faders for high, mids, and lows. My Virtual DJ does not have those, I tried to get the skin (i forget the name atm) but it would not let me load it. Is there away to get around this aside from buying? 

9b) The video showed the DJ looping a beat and matching using just the base to match. This seems VERY important to me. Am I correct?

10) In my mind, (and I am most certainly wrong) my next step would be to ""pull apart"" songs to ""sample"" into other parts of the mix. By ""pull apart"" I mean things like single out the vocal track, or grab just the baseline from a part of a song. Is this correct? This seems like it would be advanced to me, and it is not obvious on how to do this looking at the VDJ UI.

11) Is there a program like VDJ that would replicate a drum machine? Is there a way to link the 2, or would i write the drum beat, then mix that in as if it were just a song?
I think that is enough for now, but trust me I have an endless amount of questions.

12) I did record the 2 songs I put together. I tried to upload it to soundcloud to share with people I know and to post on here for advice but when I uploaded it said it violated copyrights. Is soundcloud kind of the standard method of sharing, and how to I get around the copyrights stuff?

Here is a little background on myself to give you a little idea about where I am coming from. I am sure not everyone is interested in this so if you don't care just skip this. I grew up in a musical family and played music through out my childhood through my young twenties. I have played everything from Piano, to Sax, to Trumpet, but most extensively drums. I was raised by MTV and actually watched ""Video killed the radio star"" on it's first live broadcast. I was glued to MTV until it became more reality tv than videos. I am all about the radio (of any style) and have ""studied"" top 40 my entire life. Why it took me until the age of 34 to get started DJing is beyond me. In my mind right now there are several different styles of ""show"" that I want to do. I want to mix rap and dnb (with the though being ""Fixing current rap songs""), mix 80s and 90s Dance and House, then this other over the top thing that involves DJing, but is more of a stage show. I figure mixing Dance and House would be the best start for me to learn about what is going on and explore what kind of DJing I want to do. In the long run i want to write my own beats, but I understand that is something I shouldn't worry about right now. I have used a drum machine before and I have a little more of a clue with that. I have actually wrote music before, I understand how to read music, though I am quite out of practice. Is there anything else that I could tell you that would help you help me?

I want to thank you guys ahead of time for helping me out and answering my noobish questions. I don't know any DJs so this is really the only place I know of where I can ask these questions.

[Hopefully this will work](http://soundcloud.com/beep-boop-deet-deet/forp-the-macroeconomics-of)

I've had a copy of Virtual DJ for about a year that I monkey around with in my spare time. I'm well aware that it's kind of ""baby's first DJ software"" but I haven't taken this any more seriously than just something fun to do so I haven't looked into other software too seriously.  However, one nagging question I've always had is whether or not I'm doing it right and where I could improve.  I know this isn't flawless and there are some things I'd do differently if I re-did this, but I am awfully curious what people who're more experienced with the production, rather than just the consumption (where most of my experience lays), of mixes would have to say.

For controls, currently I'm running a Midi controller (A Roland Edirol PCR-500, of all things) and don't really feel like it's lacking any/many control surfaces that I'd want to use, but that I would probably do well to learn how to use jogwheels and other useful things at some point if I were to get another midi controller.

House parties want to listen to general ""dude-bro"" music: recent rap, top 40, pop, things you'd expect at a college party. The local EDM scene is all over heavy, loud, in your face dubstep with a little DnB thrown in there. Random people tend to listen to boy bands. And of course the rednecks listen to country (Yay Kentucky).

And then you have me: My passion is EDM: Trance, Minimal, Dark Dubstep (IE Skream and Benga), House, Ambient, Hardstyle; pretty much everything not heavy dubstep. Recently I've even acquired a taste for Old School Rap and Drum and Bass. These are all genres nobody wants to listen to. Historically I'd play the first hour or so at my own house parties, tell people who complained to fuck off, its my house or that I'm new, and once the party started going hand things over to some friends who play popular dubstep and rap. The crowd for my set is ""this is alright I guess (maybe)"" to ""whhhaaaa, I can't dance to to this"" but when they play its ""Fuck yea!!"". Its demoralizing.

I could play the popular stuff, but then DJing for turns from ""awesome hobby I want to get good at!"" to ""Party Customer Service Job I want to quit"". Making it worse, since I don't know whats popular the only thing I can think of is download ""Top 40 [popular genre] of [current month]"" and become yet another boring last.fm jukebox. Might as well just leave youtube up and let people pick what they want.

How can I grow as a DJ in this situation? Force myself to treat it as a customer service job? Forever bedroom DJ on Youtube/Soundcloud/Mixcloud? Wait till I can move to Colorado? Make it my life goal to move to Europe?

Welcome to the Weekly Mix Feedback thread on r/beatmatch!  This is the thread where you post your DJ mixes and ask other people to give you feedback.  Mix posts that are not in this thread will be removed.  We are taking some cues from /r/edmproduction here, as well as incorporating input from users and most of the previous mix submission rules.  We are open to changing the format/rules so please let the mods know if you have any feedback on this.


These threads are intended for beginning DJs who are honestly looking for feedback or critique on their technique, selection, transitions, etc.  If you are an established DJ who is just looking for more followers/listens on your new mix or have a podcast/radio show, please post it to a more appropriate place such as /r/mixes or a genre-specific subreddit.   This subreddit is aimed at helping new DJs learn and is not the place to promote yourself!

Rules:

* Please include the genre(s) of your mix.  This helps attract DJs/listeners of the same genre(s) who are likely to provide more useful feedback.  You might also include a title/length.

* [Mixcloud](http://www.mixcloud.com) is the preferred place to post mixes.  It allows you to include your tracklist and transition times, allows unlimited uploads, and is generally more geared towards DJs.  If you don’t want to use Mixcloud, be sure to include a tracklist.  

* Please ask for specific feedback or list parts of the mix you liked/didn’t like.  Hopefully you are looking for input on specific tracks or transitions.   Feel free to also link to a few instances where you provided someone else good feedback.  Being active in these threads should encourage more people to listen to your mix.

Any feedback is much appreciated.

These are my thoughts on the transitions:

The first transition was quite messy, too much going on.

The second wasn't that good, it took me too long to fade the playing track.

the third was well timed and I think the best in my mix.

the fourth worked but wasn't really good.

At the fifth the two tracks didn't really work together very well. 

The sixth transition came in too early.

the seventh was okay I think.

the eighth worked well I think.

the ninth was a bit aggressive maybe.

the last worked also pretty well.

From what I can gather you want to mix with the snares. I got that no problem, what I am running into is a lot of the tracks I have have really weird phrasing and songs will go through the breakdowns at different intervals. 

I also think that because it is slightly more ""organic"" songs in different BPM ranges won't translate to others.

I've been playing around on a midi-controller for a couple of months now, but I'm having difficulty getting past a beginner level. There's a school that opened up near my place that's run by the main DJs and promoters in my area that seems pretty cool.

I realize that I could potentially learn all of this stuff for free online, but I really feel like a classroom setting would benefit my learning style. I've read/watched a fair amount of tutorials, but it'ds not quite the same as a live interaction.

On the one hand it would be great to get hands-on instruction from someone with experience, but on the other it seems like I would be better off investing the same money into tracks and equipment.

Tonight, I played outside of my bedroom for the first time ever. It wasn't exactly a glamorous gig (church youth conference), but hey, we all have to start somewhere. I was a little worried at first since there were only about fourteen other people there, but it turned out to be fine since they were all were dancing throughout my set.

I'm generally pretty happy about this mix, though I did plan most of it out beforehand. Is this normal, or do most DJs compose their sets while they perform? I assume this is the case because it allows for more adaptability if the crowd isn't feeling a particular song. What's the best way to become better at this?

Additionally, I feel like I use reverb as a crutch while mixing. If there are ever two songs that don't *quite* fit together, I reverb it to cover anything that might sound off. I don't think that this is necessarily a bad technique, but I'd like to know some other things I can do so I'm not drowning the mix in reverb every third transition.

I have set up my DDJ-WeGo and VDJ to get it where the music comes out in both the speakers and my headphones, and the cued track won't make any sound when I play it unless the cross fader is balanced or 100% on the cued tracks side.

I've been DJing for about over a year now, and have a little experience. I earned enough money at my part-time job to afford a Mixtrack Pro, as well as a few Harbinger speakers. I run off of Virtual DJ and it's been going pretty well for me so far! I've had a few gigs, paid and unpaid. But at this point, I'm coming across something I've never had to do before.

The issue:
 I'm really good friends with the captain of my school's Dance Team, and she is asking me to make them a 2-3 minute mix for a routine they want to work on. She gave me a list of about 8 songs they want (all different genres) and I'm not really sure where to start. I plan on finding the original songs, instrumentals, acapellas, as well as a remix or two for each song. Other than that, I'm not really sure where to go with this. If anyone could give any advice, I would sincerely appreciate it. Thanks so much!

I am all for trying to get shorter, tailor made mixes submitted to this sub. The idea being that people are more likely to listen and give feedback on short mixes then hour longs. If you really want to improve then instead of just submitting the mix you already made for some other reason, maybe replicate a part of it again (for practice) and submit that.

I decided to start things off because if I am going to preach rules I better stick to them right?!

Below I will outline how I would post under a new system.




Title: [Electro House] [6.57] Looking for feedback on my beatmatching and fading skills.

Text (~~Optional~~): &lt;====Not optional anymore!!

Hey guys I put together this mix today to show you my skills in beatmatching and fading, I was wondering if I could get some feedback on those things.

http://www.mixcloud.com/boeb/rbeatmatch-example-power-mix/

I used the Traktor S4 and Traktor Pro.

Tracklist and Transitions

Emma Hewitt - Rewind (Mikkas Remix)

Trans - 0:36 - 1:21

Farleon - Living Your Life (Original Mix)

Trans - 1:55 - 2:24

Jewelz &amp; Scott Sparks - Toxic Rush (Original Mix)

Trans - 2:54 - 3:24

Those Usual Suspects - Burn Forever (Michael Brun Remix)

Trans - 3:54 - 4:21

Bombs Away - Party Bass (Krunk Remix)

Trans - 5:25 - 5:40

Lucky Date - I Want You (Vengence Remix)

I thought my mix flowed well and there weren't any frequency clashes. 

[End Post]




As the OP I put a lot of work into my submission text which shows I am willing to put in effort to receive feedback, NOT just link and run.

You don't actually have to give me feedback this is just an example (you can if you want to practice giving feedback) but I think this could set a new standard for quality submissions.

Of course my mix was only very short and power mixed together but from those 5 or so transitions you can already judge my skill level and help me improve. Of course you don't know if I can play for an hour or 3 but if I take these basic principles and just practice then I could play forever, its really nothing new.

So let me know your thoughts on this and hopefully the mods will weigh in with their opinions. 

I love all you guys (No homo) :D

Some of the links are dead, but only about 10-15. I was going to group them all into a single download, but can't find a file host. I think this way is better too, so you can see what is there first.

Who should use these as they are: CDJ spinners who only have limited BPM range for Beatmatching because of deck limitations (no keylock, 12 or 16% max)But who want to have a beatmatched transition to a different genre/large tempo gap.

I noticed several with poor fidelity, and didn't listen to them all.

They are good for a listen though, because all strung together in an iTunes playlist it becomes 100 textbook transition examples ranging from ok to awesome. Just listen to them without mixing. FF to the changes. 

I don't think there's anything here that can't be done in traktor with tracks live. These are the kind of tricks and dramatic changes we're really striving for, right?

I have been watching/listening to a bunch of house/deep house sets lately (the kind of stuff that centers around long transitions and long build ups) and it sounds like the good DJs always seem to just *know* when to add and subtract samples and layers from the mix to create a perfect amount of anticipation and control over their audience's ears.  So I guess my question is, how does a DJ take his crowd by the hand and guide them on a journey, rather than just simply mix one song into another?

Should I be picking tracks before I even start mixing, and planning out individual cue points and loops so i can snap between them in the heat of the moment?

I've seen it on Amazon for $55, but I can only find it on eBay for $80-90AUD. So considering that, my question is two fold:

1. Where else can I look to get equipment, or is eBay my best bet at this point? I'm happy to do online ordering from a good retailer, but if there's anywhere in the Sydney area with a physical store that'd be more than ideal.

2. If I'm dropping so much on such a basic controller, is it worth my while to just bite the bullet, save up a little more and get a decent controller for a beginner? If it were $55 like in the US, or closer to that price point I'd have no concerns, but when it's costing me closer to $100 it makes me think that maybe that money would be better put towards a more powerful setup.

It had never even occurred to me that someone might use cue points in that manner; in the odd cases where I have more than one cue point in a track (99.99% of my tracks only have the first beat cue pointed) I've put the cue point on some vocal or musical riff in a track so that I can use it like a sample. For instance, I might place a cue point right where a track says ""this is fucking house music"" without instrumental backing so that I can quickly cue it up and drop it over something else.

In my mind using cue points to tell you when and where to start mixing in another track or line up another track removes all spontaneity from DJing. So, honest question, why do you feel it necessary to mark transition points in your songs?

One big complaint that we've heard about mixes by newer DJs is that they only play songs by the big name artists.  A major part of DJing is data digging (crate digging in the modern area) and it's time to develop that skill with this month's challenge: Small Fry.  You can ONLY play songs by artists whose pages have less than 5000 Facebook likes.

Here are this month's rules:

 * Your mix can be no longer than 15 minutes, no exceptions
 * You must tag transition times and songs on the mix itself (doesn't have to be mix cloud this month, but the tags must be on the mix, not your reddit post)
 * You can ONLY play songs by producers whose Facebook page has less than 5000 likes - Please include links to their facebook in your submission
 * Submissions close at 10 PM Pacific Time on Tuesday July 23rd
 * You will be required to leave feedback on 2 other mixes **in the voting thread**

Voting thread will be posted shortly after submissions close.

1366431224.0,7,self.Beatmatch,1cq2c5,Two beginner questions about phrase matching (examples inside),7,0,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/Beatmatch/comments/1cq2c5/two_beginner_questions_about_phrase_matching/,"Hi Beatmatch (to skip the intro go to paragraph 3ish for actual questions), 

I recently purchased a novation twitch and for the first week or so I spent most of my time playing with slicer mode, fun loop rolls, switching drops, and (as to not get overwhelmed with options from the get go) reducing my electronic music library down to a more manageable size (from ~500 songs to 53) so I can focus more on actually knowing the songs compared to ""liking"" the songs. Also I am using serato Itch instead of traktor because the default traktor mapping isn't quite to my liking and I would rather keep it simpler at the start (although I really do miss the dedicated filter knob, it is was too much fun to play with).

Anyways, I have a playlist of about 10 songs that I think go well together and I enjoy. My goal going forward is to come up with some small mixes, only a few songs at a time, to learn with and hopefully come up with some interesting sounds. The problem I noticed was that even though in my head what I'm doing should work, the mix never really sounds right. 

After googling around and searching this and other forums for beginners I realized that I don't have much of a clue about phrase matching. I spent a good chunk of time today reading up on it, counting out my songs and working on getting a feel for it, however there are two things regarding phase matching I'm confused about (probably more, this is just what I've noticed after a few hours today).

The two songs I'm talking about can be found in /r/elctrohouse vol 24, and vol 31 respectively.

1. Youtube - [Better Wipe that Up (Revolver Remix) - Lazy Rich](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58nJJ5gZDLw)
- Thread to dl - [Link to /r/electrohouse vol 24 compilation](http://www.reddit.com/r/electrohouse/comments/lysc7/relectrohouse_volume_24_is_here/)

To me it sounds like the first phrase is 8 bars long and ends around the 15 second mark. The second phrase then seems to be 24 bars and end around 1:00. Everything I've seen suggests phrases are in the vein of 4,8,16, and 32 bars. Am I counting this wrong, is this song a rare exception, or is that rule more of a guideline?

2. Youtube - [Party Bass (Reece Low Remix) - Bombs Away](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-BgbezbK4v8)
- Thread to dl - [Link to /r/electrohouse vol 31 compilation](http://www.reddit.com/r/electrohouse/comments/13k2lm/relectrohouse_weekly_compilation_31_14th_21st/)

For this song the first phrase sounds like 16 bars (0-:30), and the second phrase also sounds like 16 bars (:30-1:00). I think the next phrase starts with the beginning of the lyrics. My question here is does the new phrase start right when a new sound is introduced, or is it more about the more prominent sound while subtle synths and filters can be used during one phrase? To say it differently, it sounds like at the end of a lot of phrases the sound begins to subtly change so it flows into the next phrase smoothly. Does that sound correct?

I apologize for the wall of text and what I am sure are pretty simple questions, if you couldn't tell my music theory knowledge is lacking, and I think I am more looking for conformation that I am on the right track. 

Feel free to post any helpful hints/tricks you have learned while working with phrasing while you're here.

This took my little doodles to the next level. But now I'm trying to come up with a really nice, try-hard set and I think I might be getting too caught up in this.

How necessary is it to always be mixing in key? Of course the mix is going to sound better when things have a smooth flow and you don't want sounds to clash. But it seems like some of the magic is lost when planning out a mix and constraining yourself to only a few places to go following every track. Obviously a DJ should be well prepared and have loads of stuff in the arsenal, but still, there are some constraints there when you're in one key and only have a few options of where to go next.

What about the big chunks or segments of a mix? Maybe just have a good rise and fall mixed in key, and then the transition to the next segment would only have the tracks' beats mixed?

I'm interested in progressive house, so it's a lot of slow builds and falls, and I'd love to have things be as seamless as possible, with a lot of overlap and slow transitions.

I want to be honest with you guys; here are the problems I've noticed:

The soundcard in it is shot; so you will have to run your music off your computer. (I use an audio 2 DJ and it's perfect!)

This issue is hard to explain, but it seems as though the crossfader doesn't go all the way to the side. I start to cue a track, you can faintly hear it through the playing track.

I'd say it's still worth 50 bucks at least! I mean I bought it for over 200.

We are going to play a game! 

Pick a number between 1 and 1000. Closest to it just has to pay for shipping; and I will ship it to you. (*maybe 15 bucks? Your choice)

That is all. 

In the matter of a dispute, first person who guessed the number wins.

So not yet a beatmatcher, but I'm working on stringing together a solid track list with smooth transitions.



So heres what kind of feedback I'm looking for:

* Do people like my style of tracks?
* Do the tracks speak of a clear and sensical direction?
* Are the transitions clean? interesting? or vice versa?
* What should I do to improve?
* Should I continue to focus on staying in key? Or am I keeping too stringent to this guideline.




I've only played in front of people a couple of times so I haven't built up to any sort of crowd reading experience.  I'm currently just trying to make mixes that sound good to listen to.

First real gig I did was at a Dorm sponsored 'Halloween-Night'. Upon arriving at the location to set up my laptop + traktor + controller, I noticed that instead of large speakers, multiple small speakers were daisy chained together, with a subwoofer that was blown.

""Not a big deal"" I thought to myself, ""Sound quality is probably fine.""

I test out the levels of the speakers, and am impressed with the loudness.

The night begins, and about 150 people show up.
All those bodies immediately begin to suck up the soundwaves, and people constantly begin to hound me to ""turn up the music"".

The organizers of the event are running around trying to boost things, with no success. 

My track selection was... innapropriate. I was playing a lot of top 40 remixes and such, but girls kept approaching me, saying ""whats with these techno remixes? cant you play 'x'?""

At one point in the night, some guy in a Jabbawockeez mask came up to me and said ""Man, this dance is like some middle school shit.""

IT SUCKED.

However, I learned alot of valuable lessons about what a DJ is, and how important SOCIAL CONTEXT is. Know your crowd. Know what they are expecting. Know the equipment and its limitations, and, ultimately, be willing to do what it takes to make the party pop.

Alright so a brief history.  Pretty much since i heard my first Svenson &amp; Gielen track about a decade ago i've been a fan of edm.  i only say this because edm has been blowing up on the east coast recently and i don't want you guys to think i'm one of those 'omg skrillex and lmfao are da bomb i wanna be a super fist pumper like pauly d and get all da bitches'.  not that theres anything wrong with that i guess.  but i come from a place of love for the music and have a sense of belonging since ive been in the scene (or what there was of one) for a while and was mostly ridiculed for listening to trance/electro back in high school and shit.  

Originally I wanted to get into producing music rather than dj'ing because i always wanted to create music instead of playing someone else's.  So ive been making music for pushing 6 years now and just love it.  Now i've seen some of the creative things people are able to do with mixers, controllers, etc. and how well it translates into a live performance that trancends an individual songs experience and i want to start exploring that area of music creation. 

Unfortunately I don't run in a crowd that is into djing or anything creative musically so i'm looking to you fine passionate people for help.  


* alright enough of that shit.  heres the deal.  

Out of the blue i was talking to some randoms at a party and was able to pick up a djm 800 from a guy for really really cheap.  at this point i had done some research and when i found out he would sell it to me for $400 i jumped at it.  

So... thats where i'm at right now.  

my question to you fine people is what my next step should be.  i'm not trying to jump into playing clubs i just want to start mixing music and hopefully remixing songs if possible.

i'm totally overwhelmed by all the products out there and don't even know if my djm 800 purchase was a wise one.  

so should i buy some turntables?  cdjs?  what kind of software is recommended?  

i have an opportunity to pick up some cdj 1000 mk3s for about $1200.  anyone have experience with those?  would it be a good purchase?

any and all information yall are willing to provide will be greatly appreciated.

So in the long run I would like to have a Tech12+Mixer/CDJ+DJM rig, for a huge variety of reasons.  


Currently I have been learning on a Mixtrack Pro, but have been really disappointed with that controllers ineffectiveness in terms of learning to beatmatch.


Recently I've come into some cash and have been eyeing an S2, mainly on the basis that it is good value (relatively speaking) and I can learn to beatmatch on it. Incidentally the S2 is where I would benchmark my budget: I could go up or down a little but I definitely don't have a grand to spend. 


Thing is, while Traktor seems great (I play mostly EDM) I realize Serato is the industry standard for digital in terms of most clubs etc. and while I doubt I'll get to that point any time soon, I don't want to get locked into the wrong path here.


Also, since it's relevant: I currently actively play parties and independent shows and events, and a controller fits the bill just fine for that purpose. I would like to move out of this, but probably not for a couple years at the least.


Are there cheap options for a turntable+mixer combo that don't suck, or is an S2 a good, budget way of learning the skills of the trade?

How much of a bitch is the crossover for when I do have the money to go analog/Serato?

Using the mixer. I've got at least 3 pairs of songs that mostly play simultaneously in this mix. Sometimes it works, sometimes it sounds like a muddy mess.

Creativity. I'm still trying to figure out how to use effects in a way that actually benefits the mix, without just being total wankery. I usually just stuck with ""reverbing"" a song on its way out, and the brake function.

Mixing in key. I don't have actual knowledge of music theory, but I have a good enough ear. I realize there are a few clashes in here, but some moments work really well, also.

1. There will be a DJM and CDJ 800s there.  I think I'm OK playing on CDJ 800s, but I don't have any CDs (I have all of my stuff on USB).  I'm thinking about just getting some flight cases and bringing my 900s in.  Is this a good idea?  I'm a little concerned about not having insurance, but having my library on a USB is a HUGE benefit for me.  I'll have to start burning CDs ASAP if I want to just use the 800s.
2. What can I do to calm my nerves a bit.  I'm gonna practice a ton next week, but I'm still nervous as hell.

He isn't very dedicated to much, and showed little interest other than saying it. He played around with making beats on the computer a bit, but dropped it after about a week.


So, we were at Sam's Club a few weeks ago, and they have this electronic turntable setup that comes with some lights and speakers. Essentially, it has two...fake? turntables that each can have a cd or memory stick loaded into and you can fade between, adjust pitch, cue, scratch, etc.. He really enjoyed playing with it, though both of us sounded like a couple of idiots on it. I can't find it on their website, so I'm not sure what brand it is, or what it's called. Anyways, he's asking for the setup for his birthday.


I come to you now, asking where we should start this fledgling DJ. What is the essential equipment he needs? I know purists, from reading around a bit, will want him to start on a couple turntables, but is that the only approach? Would this electronic setup, or something similar, be a decent way to start out?

Thanks in advance!





Oh, he enjoys Daft Punk and Deadmau5...so I'm assuming he'd want to start off attempting to make music in that genre. I'm a casual listener to electronic music, and am not big on labels, so I don't even know if these artists are called DJs or not.

I want to start this post by saying that i've searched the forums, and all laptop recommendation posts have been at least a year old, so i decided to take the risk of getting downvoted to ask it again. 

My setup currently consists of Traktor kontrol S2, F1 and its wired to a desktop, as i have not done any gigs. But now i've been approached to do some, so i will have to invest in a laptop quite soon.

I would be interested on people's personal experiences who have bought laptops for DJ purposes during the past year or so. 

So many things have changed with laptops since i last looked at them, so i do not know if there are any new handy features that i should be looking for.


When i look at the traktor specs, i can see that almost any current laptop would easily be able to run it without problems.

Specs:

Windows 7 or 8 (latest Service Pack, 32/64 Bit), 2.0 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo or AMD Athlon 64 X2, 2 GB RAM (4 GB recommended) 

Mac OS X 10.7 or 10.8 (latest update), Intel Core 2 Duo, 2 GB RAM (4 GB recommended) 
General: Monitor with 1024 x 768 screen resolution, USB 2.0, 1 GB free disc space, high-speed internet required 


I am on a very low budget here, so i am interested to hear if i can manage with a 400euro laptop, or should i aim higher?


Necessities i've gathered from other posts:

1368 x 768 resolution minimum

4gb Ram.

Windows 7

Decent amount of hard drive. (is SSD A good idea?)



How about the touch screen ones? Has anyone tried using them? Do they work in Dj'ing? I am quite keen on getting away from the touchpad.

Currently none of my gear needs firewire, do i still need one just in case?

Is ASUS still a good brand?

How about toshiba/samsung? (i can see some decent looking options in one of the local stores for less than 400€.

I am under the impression that many say that any laptops will do, but i am specifically looking for a slim design, that i can fit on my ""headquarters"" at home.

Macbook, i will not be able to afford, but will get one when i can. This laptop will act as a temporary solution, and will become a fileserver whenever i can get myself a macbook.

It is highly possible that i have screwed up something while searching the forums, but i honestly could not find any similar questions that would reflect the current stock of laptops available on the market. 

IF you have seen one lately, please guide me into that topic, and i'll stop asking these stupid questions.

Thanks in advance,

Welcome to the Weekly Mix Feedback thread on r/beatmatch!  This is the thread where you post your DJ mixes and ask other people to give you feedback.  Mix posts that are not in this thread will be removed.  If you submit your mix, please take the time to listen to some other submissions, especially if they play a style of music you're interested in.  These threads can't work if you don't participate.


These threads are intended for beginning DJs who are honestly looking for feedback or critique on their technique, selection, transitions, etc.  If you are an established DJ who is just looking for more followers/listens on your new mix or have a podcast/radio show, please post it to a more appropriate place such as /r/mixes or a genre-specific subreddit.   This subreddit is aimed at helping new DJs learn and is not the place to promote yourself!   

Rules:

* Please include the genre(s) of your mix.  This helps attract DJs/listeners of the same genre(s) who are likely to provide more useful feedback.  You might also include a title/length.

* [Mixcloud](http://www.mixcloud.com) is the preferred place to post mixes.  It allows you to include your tracklist and transition times, allows unlimited uploads, and is generally more geared towards DJs.  If you don’t want to use Mixcloud, be sure to include a tracklist.  

* Please ask for specific feedback or list parts of the mix you liked/didn’t like.  Hopefully you are looking for input on specific tracks or transitions.   Feel free to also link to a few instances where you provided someone else good feedback.  Being active in these threads should encourage more people to listen to your mix.

Currently I have some super basic CD decks (Numark NDX400s) and a very basic 4 channel mixer (Numark M6). I mess around on these to work on the basics, EQing, beat/phrase matching, harmonic mixing, etc. I got these as a starting point to learn basics, and they are serving their purpose.

However, I'd like to move to a more modular setup. I've been exposing myself to a lot more different types and styles of music lately, and I have to say it has opened my eyes to a lot of new ideas. Hopefully within the very near future I will be getting a capable laptop and with it, I want to start building for the future. Like many folks, I never have a ton of money at any one point. Outside of the laptop, I've been looking at more accessible ways to build a setup that I want, while still keeping my options open.

Now, what I'm interested in, is a more live experience type setup. I'd like to build my own tracks, putting together layers, acapellas, etc. It certainly doesn't have to be exclusively this, but it's what has me most interested right now. That being said, I've also become more interested vinyl, as a medium. A out of town friend has a pair of Tech 12's that he isn't using, and has offered to swing by some time and show me the ropes a bit.

Basically I'm wondering if others have a similar type of setup, or know someone that does. What do they use, and how do they use it? I'm looking toward Traktor, and would like to include Ableton at some point along the way.

/

The gear ideas, to go with what I have:

Laptop: MacBook Pro - Birthday is coming up and this is tops on the list. Looking at used ones. Aiming for 8gb of RAM, Core 2 Duo, would like a 15"" screen, but would settle for the 13"" for now. Don't think the Retina screen is a necessity. Thoughts?

Mixer: Numark M6 - Basic, 3 band EQ, gain, USB. Already have it, no need to upgrade from here yet.

Controller 1: Traktor Kontrol X1 - This would be my deck controls, effects, etc., does what it needs to. Will likely get this to get me started and become more intimate with the Traktor program and controls.

Controller 2: Novation Launchpad - With the unlocking of the Remix decks, it seems many people were excited to set this up with their Traktor setups. Lots of buttons, color options, customizations. Added bonus of getting into the production side of things, coming with Ableton Intro, and doubles as a controller with that.

Audio Interface: NI Audio 2 - Basic, highly rated interface. Can pick one up used for cheap, even without the Traktor program if I have to, as I will likely buy a Kontrol X1 new.

/
/
/
/

From here, I figure I could add on, and go in many directions, all for something around ~$200. If I enjoy the vinyl thing, I could pick up something like a Z2, although that would go more into the ""larger purchases"" category. I could add a MIDI Fighter or something similar if I wanted to do some finger drumming, or go with an APC40 if Ableton becomes my thing.

Adding a MIDI keyboard is also an option, as I was recently blown away by seeing Robert Delong live. I know he's not the only one doing something like that, but the things that he did in front of my eyes gave me tingles.

Upgrades along the way would likely be to the mixer, mostly to become more familiar with club setups. Something like a DJM-400 would work well for my budget.

If I end up playing out (which I do aim to do) I wouldn't have to bring a ton of stuff with me, depending on the venue. The modular controllers will likely take up less space than an all in one, and if it's a super basic show, I may only need one of them. I've also looked into doing the mobile DJing thing a bit, more so as a means for income to do the shows that I WANT to play.

Anyways, sorry for the wall of text. Any input would be greatly appreciated.

I am debating between getting a S4 or getting a audio 10 set up. my plan with the S4 would be getting a turntable (at-lp120) and cdj or just two turntables and using those. I really want to get into turntablism in the next couple years.

Versus, Traktor Scratch pro 10 with DDM4000 mixer and 2 at-lp120s and one or two cdjs.

Which route should I take (I lean towards a mixer in the long run instead of a controller)? and what is a good cdj about &gt;$350 (used or new), I was thinking pioneer's cdj350 or cdj400?

My budget is about $1500.

But I also can't deny (or maybe i am in denial) that he seems to be special. 
Is it with the track lists? He has very good tracklists that despite some Cringe worthy transitions (not common place) his sets are nice to listen to, apart from the weird EQing. Oh the eqing. 
Can someone shed some light on that over powered bass that is in his live sets?
In my opinion, I think people like Giuseppe Ottaviani (still loved by trance community) is a much better DJ than Tiesto.

Tracklist on mixcloud as well as transition times.

I think there are a lot of things that need to be improved, that's why I'm posting it here. 

The first transition went pretty good i think. 

The second one was a bit messy. 

The third and fourth were a bit too sudden. 

During Return Of The Funk the reverb just randomly popped to 70.

The fifth transition worked pretty good because of the same sounds.
 
The sixth was a bit too long maybe.

The seventh and eighth transition worked pretty good I think.

I'm trying to help him get set up to be at least a little more than a playlist ""dj"" with as little expense as possible... Since he's only playing music for Latin partner dancing, the only thing he really needs is preview monitoring, levels/gain, cuing and cross-fading. ...And of course a way to get the sound into the amp.

The amp has XLR and 1/4inch inputs (I can't remember off the top of my head if it has RCA inputs). He has a mac laptop an an iPad... I was thinking about having him get an Audio2 plus a splitter so he could put one channel on the L and R of the amp and use the second channel for headphones. That way he could just take my Traktor library with all my cue points and corrected bpm's and just control it with the keyboard. Then maybe if he wants to get tricky, an iPad midi app can be added later...

I've been looking at some of the mini hardware controllers, but I don't know anything about the sound quality that these things put out... It doesn't have to be crazy sound quality - but the system is bigger than a set of desktop speakers.

There is alot of talk on Rekordbox, and I do have the software. Unfortunately, to this point I have not spent alot of time  using it.

(Quick note: I tried using the search and the threads in r/dj, but I don't understand what they are talking about and they all seem to be based on some experience whereas I have none.)

I've been interested in learning turntable mixing for awhile, I saw arrabmusik on his MPC and am very interested in that now as well. I have mixed music together for quick youtube videos i've done, but its just adobe sound editing nothing like this. 

I just want something I can play around with at home just for fun. I don't like being limited though. I was looking at the APC but that looks expensive, I found a novation launchpad which seems like it would be good and is cheap but I really don't know anything about these.

Can anyone suggest a good starter turntable setup and/or midi controller(not a keyboard, something like the launchpad)? Also where could I buy these things in Ontario Canada? The novation is not sold in canada...
Price range prefer under 500$.

I try to count bars, so the song doesn't mix in strange sounding place. I set a 4 bar loop, in the place I want the song to come in at. I press out on the loop when I want to mix it.
I have set cues in songs I like to mix, so I can mix however these are songs which I like. Will I have to set up cues for each or just find it whilst djing but using headphones for the cue only?
My DJing sounds quite same-y though as I just use the 4 bar fade in. I was wondering what I could do, as I am quite nervous for my first DJ set? I will try to play music for what the crowd wants. My friend has amps and p.a systems, I think the venue will have these as well. Any ideas of what I need? I would like a ableton launch pad to play effects as I cant play effects on my controller. edit- the gig will be to around 200 people at most. edit: It will be a 20-30 mins set.

I think my mix from Symphony to In The Air is pretty awesome (starts around 5:00). Around 11:00 I go from Nova - Get Ready and I think it's okay too. 12:45 there is a decent transition from Get Ready - Compurhythm.

Here's my plan, tell me what you think. ANY suggestions, advice, opinion are welcome. I also have some questions for you and would really appreciate some perspective.

I've played around a bit with Mixxx and my keyboard (not for long) and I feel like I would be able to learn a lot more and faster with a midi controller. I have an [NI audio 2dj](http://www.djtechtools.com/2009/07/21/native-instruments-audio-2-dj-soundcard/), and I've read good things about the [numark mixtrack](http://www.amazon.com/Numark-MIXTRACK-DJ-Software-Controller/dp/B003UVASTO/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1355291048&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=mixtrack). My local music store sells it for $150CAD, Amazon has it for $110 USD, with the exchange rate atm, it's still cheaper to get it from the states, and it will be with free shipping. So my question for those who have experience with it is: how often is are they a defective product, how long does it last? Is there a manufacturers waranty? How likely is a local music store to provide warranties? Are there other controllers worth getting in my situation (budget up to $150 for just controller)?

On top of the controller, I've been thinking about purchasing a set of headphones for this hobby. I've been looking at the [numark redwave](http://www.amazon.com/Numark-RED-WAVE-DJ-Headphones/dp/B004M13GA4/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1355291163&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=redwave) since a lot of people seem to recommend it and it is quite a decent price. I will only be bedroom djing for awhile so that's something to keep in mind. I am also able to try it out at the local music store to check for sizing since that seems to be a major concern in the reviews I've read. My question is, is it really worth it to spend money on a new set of headphones if I'm just starting out? How big of a difference does it make compared to wearing in-ear headphones?

I browse /r/djs and /r/beatmatch on a regular basis. I plan on purchasing and reading [How to DJ right](http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/how-to-dj-right-frank-broughton/1100624524?ean=9780802199744). I want to start dedicating an afternoon every weekend to this hobby. I have a friend who makes playlists on 8track that I enjoy very much. They are without transitions, so I plan to take those playlists and mix them in order to learn how to transition and beatmatch. On top of that if time permits I will try to participate in the MoM Comp. What do you think of my learning plan? How would you describe a learning routine that gave you the most improvement?

Another question I have is about genres. For me, the idea of pleasing a crowd but at the same time expanding their horizons in music is very appealing to me. While I am only at the beginning of my journey into the world of music, it is a what motivates me, to be creative and share the creativity of others. So I try to listen to many different genres and try to see what people appreciate about them; it would be a thrill to find understand the attractiveness of something and show it to somebody else! But I am just a beginner and I am getting the impression that trying to mix different genres will be very difficult at the start. Does this mean I should stick to a genre for a time while I'm learning?

TL;DR: Trying to get started, have an NI audio 2dj, plan to buy a [numark mixtrack](http://www.amazon.com/Numark-MIXTRACK-DJ-Software-Controller/dp/B003UVASTO/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1355291048&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=mixtrack), and maybe a [numark redwave](http://www.amazon.com/Numark-RED-WAVE-DJ-Headphones/dp/B004M13GA4/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1355291163&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=redwave). Going to participate in MoM Comp and read [How to DJ right](http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/how-to-dj-right-frank-broughton/1100624524?ean=9780802199744).

I have played instruments (Saxaphone in Jr High and Bass Sax in Jazz band during Jr High, Some keyboard when younger and relearning it now). Ive been practicing Beatmatching with out visual cues and want to avoid the sync button like the plauge.

It's all circa 2002 or so, and hasn't seen much use since. Everything's covered in dust, and she said it definitely needs new needles and might need to be recalibrated. 

I have a 450-watt amp and some decent speakers and a sub in my garage. 

 I don't know the first thing about DJing, but it's been a long time fantasy of mine to learn. I just never made the investment. 

Can someone give me some guidance on the best way to get these operational again, and a good online primer on the most basic DJ skills (beatmatching?). What needles do I need? Where can I buy covers for these to prevent further damage? Any other equipment I'll need? Will this work with my home stereo?

I'd rather not put more than about $100 into getting these working again. Is that realistic?

I should add that I have no illusions that I'll be doing this as a career. I just want to learn for the sake of learning and because I enjoy the craft and the music. 

**Edit:** Wow - thanks everyone!  I got so excited thinking about these turntables last night that I couldn't sleep, and then I woke up early this morning to clean them up.

I've been so scared to record myself because I make mistakes every time, but I realized that I kind of have to get over myself and just start correcting my mistakes as they come. 

Link: [Pilot Mix](http://soundcloud.com/red-veil/pilot-mix)

I'm fully aware of the mistakes but I need you guys to point out some obviously correctable mistakes so I can continue practicing with the right techniques and mindset. 

Some obvious mistakes are when I was tempted to switch back to the previous song because I don't have a midi controller or splitter to preview the other deck. This a bad habit I've developed to make up for the lack of sampling and I need help correcting it.

Some key things that I noticed: 

* **0:00** - Kinda lame intro, it's just the intro of 1 song. How do I spice that up?
* **7:23** - I was freaking the fuck out here because I cued Mode too early. 
* **17:00** - I jumped back to Lunar by accident.
* **18:20** - Realized jumping back to Lunar would be awesome, so I did it. 
* **20:00** - Pretty freaking bad, You could hear the vocals starting to come in on Hippie Dreams as I tried to transition over to Red Line. 
* **21:59** - Was this too sudden?
* **23:03** - Wanted to jump back to Red Line, but chickened out because it sounded so off. 
* **30:12 - 31:18** - Was really unsure of how I wanted to mix in Bass Cannon, so I didn't at first, which lead to the off-key opening of Bass Cannon and the abrupt mix-in.
* **44:00** - Not proud of that mix-in.
* **44:38** - Should have transitioned 4 beats earlier. Throws the mix off for the next 2 minutes. 
* **48:50** - I don't even...
* **53:40** - No excuse here. That was just unacceptable bad.

If there's anything else, please do point it out to me! Criticism is preferred!

* **I will add more as I re-listen to the mix.**

This was mixed entirely with hot cues, a mouse and a keyboard on VDJ. This would be done in small private party settings.

When all hooked up and the Laptop is running off the charger, I'm getting interference coming through, take out the charger and it's fine.

* Trying another circuit (ran an extension cord downstairs) 
* Checked Traktor latency, all is well.

Recently some of them have taken up shuffling, and have started asking for shuffling music, hardstyle, EDM, etc. Unfortunately I don't have a whole lot of experience in this area (I'm a big dubstep fan but that's not quite the same), and I'd appreciate a few artist/song recommendations to help me out. Also, if possible, is there any more ""mainstream"" music that is good for shuffling?

On top of all that, I'm looking to start taking my DJing elsewhere (the rink treats me like absolute shit, and at $7 an hour I don't need to put up with it), so what kind of equipment should I buy that's at an affordable price for a broke college student?

I have an [American Audio VMS4](http://www.vms4dj.com/images/125047.jpg) that works fine in Traktor Pro, but in Traktor Pro 2, midilog 1 (aka channel 1) acts as a master for all the decks.

I have it set up so midilog 1 is Deck C, midilog 2 is Deck A, 3 is B, and 4 is D. So if i have a song playing on Deck A with the volume fader all the way up, there is no output unless I turn Deck C fader up. Same goes for the rest of the decks. And it's not only the volume fader but the Gain and 3 EQs.

It is the same with every mapping I find and even when I made my own mapping with only two decks (so not to use midilog 1 at all).
Since it still works fine in Traktor Pro 1 I feel like it's not a hardware issue? But I have no idea.

I'm completely new to DJing and want a bit of advice as to what gear I need. Now I apologise in advance for how n00bish and possibly unrealistic my expectations or thoughts are. Now, i'm more into the creation side of it (production?) and using Ableton, making mashups and kind of making the sort of music I want to hear. But, and this is probably going to sound a bit douchey, but I would like to be able to DJ to impress friends and be a bit of a hit at parties and 'show off' my music more than just sharing it online, as well as playing popular 'club' music. Once again, probably a bit douchey but I've been inspired by Skrillex to give it a go, because I hear his story was that he managed to do it just using Ableton and not really being a DJ before. 

So, being new to this I don't really understand what you need. I've read the DJing for Dummies book and they say about CDJs and vinyl decks, and i've also read things online and looked up youtube tutorials. From what I understand though, you can DJ using an iPad and basic decks now, right? A CDJ would be a little excessive for what I'd want to do? They're $1000+. Plus there's probably an app for a beatpad so you wouldn't really need the controller, yeah (although it looks like it'd be really helpful for Ableton)? I don't want to pay a boatload of money and then realise that i'd never really use it and it'd be a passing phase of mine, or I'd have equipment worth far in excess of what I'd need. I'm more interested in the performance side of it so I'd be after something that looks cool. I'm aware you can probably even do much of what I'd want with just an iPad these days but try telling people you ""DJ a bit"" and will DJ their party, and show up with just an iPad and they'll think you're having a laugh. This sort of thing looks like what I'd be interested in: http://www.americanmusical.com/Item--i-PIO-XDJAERO-LIST?src=W1107DJBE1107DJA&amp;utm_source=djbooth&amp;utm_medium=homepagebanner&amp;utm_campaign=product especially with the ability to use your phone as a bit of a remote. 

But at $1000 it's far too much for me right now at this early stage. So really, what i'm after is something good for parties (but more than just a glorified iTunes player), something that is digital-focussed (as I had a thought to use a tablet as another controller, and a laptop with Traktor or something), something I can mix with that has decent enough features and something that is respectable and professional-looking and not a 'toy"" where I have to actually do something more than press 'play', but yet something that is pretty cheap. 

Also, there's an event almost a year out (just an annual party thing we uni students have, it's pretty casual) that I'd like to get good enough to DJ at (yeah, for cool points....they usually just have a laptop open playing an iTunes setlist so having a dedicated decent DJ for free would be a godsend in their eyes), is it possible or a bit unrealistic to expect to be reasonably good enough to be able to perform live by then with a bit of practice and determination?

Lastly, and this is going to sound REALLY dumb, but after reading everything I just don't really ""get"" DJing. I thought you made your own songs by mixing two songs together, so like one song's lyrics with the music of another, and bits of the two, but from what I read it sounds like just playing one song, and then seamlessly playing a similar BPM song after and really you need to make the songs using Ableton etc beforehand and then piece it together at the show to make it seem like you're not just pressing 'play'. I don't want to be the gimmicky guy that just remixes the 'hits' but I don't get how to make your own thing using DJing rather than Ableton. I've tried ""mixing"" similar sounding songs on my computer and it just sounds like two songs playing over the top of each other. I just don't get how you do it. And since songs have different structures obviously one chorus is going to be a different length to another song's, so they won't line up when you switch them over. Is the reality that you just have to use two very similar songs, or can you mix the beat from The Next Episode with California Love or something? Is it a lot easier to just choose songs without words or one with, and one without etc?

My goal is to create a 4 button build up using Beatmasher 2. I want to seamlessly work my way up and down a scale of 2/4, 1/4, 1/16, 1/32. To do this I need to set up modifier's that allow the effect to be turned on when one button is pressed, keep it on when I press other buttons and turn it off when they're all released. I've tried countless variations of this for nearly six hours to no avail.

I have finally settled on a method to make it function, using an incrementing modifier. Each time a button is pressed the modifier is increased, each time it's released it decreases. Here are some photos of two of the four buttons I am trying to map. I figure if I can get the first two buttons too work, the other two should be easy.

-Started mixing about a month and a half ago with an S2 and traktor pro 2 on PC.

-One day, open Traktor and turn on my S2 and something is wrong:

- Buttons lie cue, play, load A, load B, FX on, and scrolling through playlist do not work(no response in traktor). However, Wet/dry, volume, loop size knob, and EQs still respond in traktor.

-First I assumed it was the software, so I reset all settings in Traktor. Nothing.

-After playing around trying to figure it out, eventually nothing is working at all.

-By now I think it's my controller that is no longer functionning.

-Couple days later, try again: same result as when it first stopped working.

-Contact customer support: they get me to reinstall traktor and controller editor: nothing.

-Proceed to send back to Native-Instruments.

-Get new one.

-Turn on.

-Same. Fucking. Thing.

-Flip the fuck out.

-Reinstall traktor, making sure I deleted EVERYTHING remotely related to it before installing again. Nothing.

-Realize I had not checked support center so I open that up, it tells me I have updates to install. Hooray I found the problem! Right? No. I update everything: everything is still as it was when it first stopped working.

-Maybe it's my computer? So I go get my moms mac, install traktor on it, activate it with the code that came in the box with my new S2. Still. Not. Fucking. Working.


So that is where I stand. I feel completely hopeless, I hate Native-Instruments, I'm shitting my pants because I'm supposed to mix in front of 250 people at my after prom in a week (I go to a big school).

The second song on that album (time lapse) is listed as 87bpm which sounds correct if I change my metronome to be 8/8. It also sounds correct of I double the bpm to 174bpm. 

This is probably more of a music general question but is an 8 beat measurement at 87bpm the same as 174 at 4/4?

Is there a reason the songs are labeled differently in their bpm?

Also, they wanted us to play latin songs and hip-hop and since I usually dj Trap, House, and hip-hop playing any of the recommended latin songs were a complete surprise to me on how the audience would react. Overall, a fun positive experience though. I learned if you want to break up a crowd at the end of the night play dirty bit by the black eyed peas, hahaha. What was your first paid dj'ing experience?

It does it's job and blends both songs pretty nicely, but that pretty much seems to be the only technique I can use for a smooth transition.

Doing this live at a party or something would probably be boring and I'd be better off playing just a prerecorded set if anything. 

So my question is, how do I improve in terms of mixing (more mixing techniques, effects, etc.). Anything that's different than just bringing in a new song as one kind of dies out and playing with the volume/crossfader.  How can I keep my mixing dynamic and exciting, especially for doing something live? When I try out something new (for example, setting a cue point through a song and jumping back to that cue point a few times quickly, it sounds okay, mediocre at best, but overall just not that great). Any suggestions/help on improving? At this point it feels like I'm just choosing songs and putting them into one continuous mix, which is fine for the time being, but if I wanted to mix at a live party, I don't think simply mixing two songs and blending one in and taking the other one out would fly.

Apologies if this is obvious or it's been covered before but I'm yet to find the answers i'm looking for. I've screwed around with the software but I'm not really sure what I'm doing, so I thought I'd ask in here.

Anyway, three parter:

* What's the best method you've found of getting a sample? E.g. from a video file, audio file or youtube video and into Traktor.
* What's the best way to load up, swap and play samples while you're performing with a Kontrol S2? For example, say I have a bunch of samples in a playlist -- what's the button presses I'd need to load a sample up such that I can press a button and have it play through. I've played in this area but I've not found results I like -- I'd like to be able to mash the button and it play the sample each time i hit the button, and the last time i hit the button the sample just plays through. I don't want to have to hold the button down to play it through, but if this is the only way I can, then fine. This all seemed a lot simpler with sample decks, with the new remix decks I've no real idea what I'm doing.
* Any tips for using samples in an interesting way? What sounds the best? Do you use them? If so, how and why? If not, why not, or what should I *not* do?

What I am looking for is to switch to digital at this point.  I'm not looking to pop out a mix or two and then start handing out business cards, I just want to be able to make some mixes in my living room for friends and have some fun.

Now for what I am looking for...

1)  ~~4 channel ability.~~ 2+2 ability  I'm not ready to toss out my old cd decks, and would like the ability to use them to supplement my mixing and possibly adding on samplers.  (this is not make or break)

2)  Built in soundcard.  I simply can't justify adding extra money just to use headphones, it's got to be built in.

3)  Decent construction.  If it feels cheap it makes me nervous.  I like durable equipment, something that can last a few years.  I'm not looking to beat the thing with a hammer, but I don't want a jog wheel quitting in six months.  Replaceable fader would be nice too.

4)  $200-$300 (maybe up to $350) area.  Yeah, I know, I'm low balling it, but I simply cannot afford to drop $600 bucks on this, I can't justify it.  

I've got my eyes, on a few, The Reloop Mixage, Stanton DJC4, Mixtrack Pro, Denon MC2000, Hercules MX2, Hercules RMX 4   

Am I missing out on one or another devices?  What do you guys recommend?

I'm also plan to annihilate the rest of my tax return on a mixer, but am sorta battling with myself on which one to get. 

So I can get a Traktor Z2 for $650 with a hookup at Guitar Center, but I was also looking at the Xone 42, which I may be able to get for around the same price, maybe a little more.

I'm not what anyone would consider a great DJ (yet!), I've been using Ableton with an APC40, and just got tired of it, it seemed way too easy and in my opinion I'm not learning how to properly beatmatch and focus on the basic art of dj'ing. I really want to learn the ""traditional"" way.

I know with the Z2, I already get TSP 2, and a built-in soundcard, that alone would be another $450 ish on top of the 42 if I wanted to use traktor. The thing that is attractive about the 42, is it's 4-channel (not 2+2), so down the line I could learn mixing four way, and maybe think of getting at least one CDJ to learn that for club-mixing (I have that opportunity already, just am not super comfortable with my skill level).

Going further down the traditional route, I have been buying some vinyl records, so I would use that in conjunction as well. I spin mainly house/UK garage/techno, and probably will learn scratching hip-hop for fun, but that's not the kind of music I produce or DJ. For a non-laptop setup, I think the Xone 42 would blow the water out of the Z2 as far as sound quality and hardware effects. (for the type of stuff i spin, effects aren't used too much either probably)

Should I wait and save money? Buy the Z2 now? Maybe buy the 42, and get TSP2 on Amazon (split the payments up?)

Many options these days, and maybe I'm thinking too much, but that's what I do. Appreciate any advice.

Tracklist and approximate transition times:

    00:00 Same Never Changed (feat. Tami)
    02:00 My Lucky Star
    04:55 Less Than 3
    07:12 It Went
    09:15 Here We Go
    12:08 I Live for the Bass
    15:05 Say My Name Bitch
    17:10 Martinis &amp; Mixed Feelings
    19:15 Space Invader
    20:58 MTC
    22:53 Bad Boy
    26:02 Feel the Melody
    28:05 Snow White Line


My thoughts on the transitions (using the transition times):

2:00

* Overall pretty good, but I feel like the vocals from My Lucky Star didn't *quite* fit.
* I think the actual move from Same Never Changed into My Lucky Star was pretty spiffy.


4:55

* One of the best from this mix.
* I may have killed My Lucky Star a tad too quick; I was afraid of some vocal overlap.


7:12

* Another smooth one. Possibly the best in this mix, basically perfect in my eyes!


9:15

* Also pretty smooth.
* I should have killed It Went before the vocals came back


12:08

* A little vocal overlap at 12:15, otherwise pretty good.


15:05

* Also pretty good.. the initial introduction of Say My Name was a little choppy against I Live for the Bass



17:10

* Smoooooth as a really smooth thing. No complaints!


19:15

* Again, no complaints.


20:58

* A bit awkward with the vocal overlap.
* Killed the mid to minimize the overlap; I should have kept it going until the bass from MTC came in.


22:53

* Confession: I've used this exact transition before in the past and it was well-received.
* The beats were off by a tad, but overall it went through pretty well.


Side note: 25:40; failure to transition. ABORT!


26:02

* After I fixed the beatmachin', this went though pretty well.


28:05

* Actually moved into this song way too early into it. I wanted to end with *part* of this song.. not all 5 minutes.
* A bit of dissonance between this, made it sound pretty bad for about 10 seconds.

Also, I was wondering if there are any DJs out there that still play a pure-vinyl setup. I've experimented with actual (vs emulated) vinyl before and I have to say, I enjoy it much more than emulation from a tactile standpoint, and it improves the reliability of my rig as I don't have to worry about my laptop failing.

I run Serato DJ with my DDJ-SX and I read online that I should choose mono instead of stereo since most venues run mono anyways. Is this true?

he has a cue point set up for the new track but I just can't quite get down the seamlessness of the cut.  I am able to make very solid slam transitions if I line up the end of the previous tracks 32 count with the beginning of the new tracks 32 count because the song makes it so easy for me to know when to switch.

however, often times I find I am off just a 1/2 second or so and I'll get a kind of clash of the beats that is noticeable enough to break things up.  or say I'm trying to cut from the end of a buildup from song 1 into the bass drop in song 2 i just miss the transition sometimes.

are there any specific tricks/techniques to make these seamless?  Should the second track actually be cued up so that the beat you are trying to hit has just passed?

Just started mixing with Serato DJ, and I've never done anything like this before, so bear with me. I've pretty much figured out how to do a seamless transition between songs whose bpm's are close (or one is close to 2 times the other). I just adjust the speed of each deck until it matches without making either track sound awkward. I try not to adjust a song by more than +/- 4bpm.

However, if I think of a song whose beat would fit reasonably well with what's playing now and, for example, I'm playing a 120 bpm track and the one i'm thinking of is 85 bpm, then I won't be able to beatmatch without ruining the sound of at least one of the tracks. Is there a way to transition in this situation without it sounding shitty?

I also know that Serato DJ does Smart sync and Simple sync, but if I apply this in such a situation, it makes it sound very obvious that the song is slowed down. Is there a trick here, or is there some extra function that I just don't know about in Serato DJ that will help me here. If not, then I guess I'll just have to be smarter about my song choices, or just live with the deep sounds of a slowed down track.

I have a very simple question for USB Djs.

I started out as a laptop DJ a few years ago, slowly moved onto CDs and I'm already sick and tired of burning CDs. They cost a lot to buy and there's always that chance of CDs skipping etc. And I'd always forget to take that one CD I want to play to a gig. Therefore I'm moving onto USB flash drives because I can fortunately use Rekordbox on the decks I just bought. 
So, my question is to all those is: Which USB stick do you use?! Such a simple question but I don't want to buy a shitty slow one that can crash a lot. Looking for 16GB minimum. Looked at the [Corsair Survivor](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Corsair-CMFUSBSRVR-16GB-Survivor-Flash-Drive/dp/B000VUP2IY) and it looks like most professional DJs use these. They look very very durable and will probably do the job very effectively. 

Also I was wondering what the difference is between 2.0 and 3.0 sticks? I see these a lot when I'm searching for products. Are the 3.0s just simply faster/more reliable?

And then there's also the RMX 2, which looks so much more sleek. And the 4-set, which my friend owns and she says it's great and gets the job done (is tough to use with Traktor though.)

The MK4 seems like a good option as well, but seems a little cheaper and limiting to me.

So my question is - what's your own experience with each of these controllers, and what's the best bang for the buck? My budget is around $200.. $300 if I'm really convinced.

recently a DJ I like was having a rant on facebook about people using MIDI controllers to simply mix two songs together whereas cheaper CDJs could easily do this job. He said something like having an S2 and only using it to transition between songs is like having a lamborghini and never taking it out of the garage.

Putting aside the CDJs vs. MIDI controller argument, what could he be referring to? I've felt a little unchallenged recently by beatmatch + crossfade but I'm not too sure what else to do that'd sound right.

I guess I'm asking what're some better/more interesting/more creative ways to DJ that Traktor and the S2 for instance allow you to do, but feel free to speak more broadly about the advantages of MIDI controllers if it could help anyone.

Secondly, the next thing I'll need to buy is a mixer. My long term goal would be to use a digital vinyl/timecode system, possibly Traktor Scratch. I have no vinyl collection to speak of and it seems a good alternative from what I've seen. Can anyone give me any advice on choosing a mixer and/or DVS?

I have no real clue how much money I can spend on this. I have no money at the moment, but hoping to have some soon enough.

What kind of budget, realistically, are you looking at, taking all things into consideration? I'm talking a decent mixer, pair of Tech12s (or equivalent) Serato, soundcard, cables, slipmats etc.
I don't know as much as I'd like about the gear side of DJing beyond ""Here's some software and a controller"". Also I know Serato is the industry standard but I assume you can control Traktor with this kind of setup (Traktor is what I'm used to currently), thoughts on that?

My dilemma is this: I've been listening to a lot of old-school hip hop in mash-ups and stuff, and I like the sound, but I am completely lost when it comes to knowing the names of the older artists because... I grew up in a very religious household. Don't even get me started on the pop culture references that I totally don't understand. Journey? Yea I heard them for the first time when I was 19.

Anyways, I was never allowed to listen to ""secular"" music when I was a kid. This basically means my parents doggedly oversaw and censored the music that I was allowed to listen to, and as a result, I have a ridiculously stunted imagination when it comes to playing 90s hip-hop, since I was never exposed to it. I mean, I know about Biggie and Tupac and Dr Dre, but I don't know a damn thing about tracks that weren't top 10 hits.

So I'm trying to get back in the game after 5 year hiatus. Originally learned on vinyl and eventually moved to Torq because it was the cheapest digital vinyl system (DVS). I started out strictly mixing hip-hop but branched out. Now I want to play pretty much everything. got the newer version of Torq but it just doesn't cut it. it isn't reliable enough for scratching, (sticker drift) and sometimes it will take a couple seconds just to recognize that I'm moving the control vinyl.

So my question is, should I get Traktor or Serato? I've heard that ssl is better for hip-hop while traktor is better suited for house music, but I play both. I'd like to utilize effects which I have heard that Traktor has more effects. Also I'd like to be able to dj without turntables if possible when I don't feel like lugging them around, is this even possible with SSL?

so I'm leaning towards Traktor, but price is somewhat an issue, and I think I can find used serato boxes for cheaper on ebay.

I personally use [Virtual Audio Cables](http://software.muzychenko.net/eng/vac.htm)(VAC), but DJTT often talks about a program called [JACK](http://jackaudio.org/) that may also work, try it and report back.

First you're going to have to install VAC, this has complications depending on your OS version so Google can help you better than I with this.

**CUE FUNCTIONALITY**

First open up VAC and create two cables. [Picture](http://imgur.com/4sVPr)

Then set your Traktor Audio Device to ""Virtual Audio Cable"" [Picture](http://imgur.com/E02OP)

Next set your output routing to use the cables. [Picture](http://imgur.com/5jF3i)

Now for the tricky part, we have to make windows essentially route both audio cables to your main out(seriously). I'll show how to do this in a series of images.

With Traktor, there's two separate decks shown, so I'm having some issues with cueing up and beatmatching them. Also, in VDJ I could physically see the individual bars and phrases, but in Traktor, I don't see a way of counting bars at all.

1376082245.0,2,self.Beatmatch,1k1u2j,Semi-new DJ: CDJ-850 and DJM-700 or DDJ-SX?,5,3,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/Beatmatch/comments/1k1u2j/seminew_dj_cdj850_and_djm700_or_ddjsx/,"~~**UPDATE:** I'm pretty much decided on the CDJ setup. However, I'm going for the 2000s and still deciding on a mixer. Anyway, thank you /r/Beatmatch for your insight :)~~

**UPDATE2** Well, nevermind what I said. TIL I'm a total schizophrenic who doesn't actually know what they want. Now I'm considering the S4, not the SX. See the comments...



I'm coming from a Behringer BCD3000 and I'm looking to upgrade for the long term. Meaning, I don't want to stay a bedroom DJ... I'm going to be a college student and I want to play parties and get some gigs. I also have dreams of playing in clubs. 

I'm buying from Amazon, so the CDJ/DJM setup will be like $2280. The DDJ-SX is $1000.


CDJ/DJM setup pros and cons:

+ Club-Standard or very close to it

+ Rekordbox (I can just take my memory sticks to the club and be ready to go)

+ Does not require laptop

+ Can be backed up by CDs

- Way more expensive

- Not very portable

- Being phased out by controllers?


DDJ-SX setup pros and cons:

+ Close enough to club standard CDJ setup?

+ Very portable compared to the CDJs

+ Way less expensive 

+ Next big thing in the industry?

- Requires laptop

The DDJ-SX wins in portability and affordability, but the CDJs seem more versatile and does not need a laptop. If I were playing in college parties or whatever, I fear the possibility of a drunk someone spilling their drink on my MacBook (it's like my lifeblood).


-----
On a slightly unrelated note, I've been watching YouTube and I realized mixes tend to be more professional and smooth when performed on CDJs. When I watch CDJs, the DJ takes their time to make a good transition and pick good songs, whether it be tech-house, trance, or electro. When I watch controllerists, they try to make a big performance out of it, and it ends up a big mess of sound effects and music that don't mix well together. Practically every DDJ-SX video is like this. To be honest, this fact really turns me off from buying a controller... or am I being unreasonable?",Hardware,False,self,t5_2syix,1376267239.0,,,True,t3_1k1u2j,http://www.reddit.com/r/Beatmatch/comments/1k1u2j/seminew_dj_cdj850_and_djm700_or_ddjsx/,

I'm trying to build a budget DVS setup, and I found an insane deal on a Xone 42. My question is though, should I spend the money to put an innofader in the mixer to scratch, or buy a cheaper scratch mixer only for scratching, like the new DJ Tech one I've been hearing some good things about. The innofader in the Xone 42 would be the same price as the Dj Tech mixer with an innofader already in it.

Ideally I'd like just one mixer, but if two is necessary I'll take it. I don't want to have a mixer that's a jack of all trades but master of none.

EDIT:I'm adding some more information.

My budget is $350 for a mixer, unless I can get a really good deal on something more expensive.
I was hoping for 3 channels (I want to do the Jeff Mills thing eventually with 3 turntables) but two I guess would be fine for now.

I was looking at the Behringer Nox303, Xone 22, Xone 32 (if I can get a deal on it), a Pioneer 707, or an old Vestax mixer, which all go for under my budget in my area.

I'm primarily a mix DJ but I also want to scratch. Should I buy a scratch mixer to learn to scratch and mix on it or buy a mixing mixer and put in an innofader and scratch that way?

How i see it i have a few options...

&gt; Buy Pioneers Cdj's (850 preferably but will settle for 800s). 

* I'd have to sell my denons to afford these

&gt; Buy Technics, got in contact with a guy recently selling a pair in very good nick for £400. 

* Here i can keep my denons and have a little spare cash to get some must have vinyl for me. 


* Or i can sell my denons and have alot of spare cash for some must have vinyl

* Or lastly sell my denons and buy a laptop to run serato off but i wont be able to afford a macbook 

I would like pioneers because it would get me more used to club set ups 

but i would like technics to spin some old hiphop vinyls i have and generally add to my set up. Not too big on the thought of djing with software (just preference) but i'd always have the option to sell some kit and buy a laptop.

I've also thought about just buying one turntable, but that will add another £100 odd pound if i feel to buy another

In radio edits, these song contain no intro of just beats to mix into, and your lucky if you get a melody to start with before the vocals kick in.  If the outgoing track goes into an Outro, then sure I can mix this song in no problem.  Just use a loop and Introduce the song when it goes into the beats.  But if the outgoing track is also a song with no outgoing section to mix over, then I usually end up trying to force it and botching the mix.  Sometimes ill hit play when the track ends, but idk it just seems boring and lifeless to me and I like to keep the flow moving in my mixes.  What are some tricks and tips you guys use to deal with this?

Then there's the songs that after the intro go into a 4, 8, or 16 beat breakdown or a crash cymbal into silence before the verse starts.  If the crash is what I desire then the mix is simple, cut out the outgoing song at the crash.  But sometimes it can get annoying if the silence occurs in multiple instances throughout the gig.  Or even sometimes I figure the incoming verse will sound really good over the outgoing tracks Outro... But ill mess up the phrasing if I miss the loop, or worse get it wrong and now I'm track wrecking.  Other times it will straight up sound bad and obnoxious because I've looped a crash cymbal that's now crashing every 8 beats...

I see videos and hear it on mixes were djs have mastered this issue in their mixes, but idk I guess I'm still in my experimenting stages of trying to figure out what sounds good to me.  So again, just looking for any pointers you guys might have.

So I've been thinking about purchasing new equipment sometime this summer and I was originally thinking about waiting for the new [Vestax VCI-400](http://www.digitaldjtips.com/2013/04/vestax-vci-400-gets-traktor-deckadance-djay-editions/) to release the Traktor edition, but I've also been toying around with the idea of switching things up and purchasing actual turntables and a mixer instead of a new controller.  I enjoy spinning hip-hop, funk, and trip-hop tunes, and I feel like spinning platters would allow for better control, as well as improved scratching and word cuts which I like to incorporate in my mixes.  Also, I'd like to make the transition from Serato to Traktor because I heard the effects are much better, and preferably I'd like to go from 2 channels to 4 just to have more mixing options.  I figured I would do the digital vinyl route so that I can play all of my mp3 tunes, but I also enjoy the thought of giving actual vinyl DJing a shot if I wanted to.  However, before I take the dive I was hoping some of you might be able to answer some questions...



-I don't know anything about mixers, but is there a decently priced mixer that allows for the same sort of functionality that a controller layout provides (cue points, loops, effects, etc.)?  I've seen the Z2 and it appears as if that provides everything I'm looking for, but it's a bit out of my price range considering the amount of hardware I'd have to purchase for this new setup.

-Does anyone have any turntable recommendations?  Obviously Technics would be the top choice, but once again, I can't afford to drop that much for two turntables.  I was taking a look at these [Stanton T62s](http://www.amazon.com/Stanton-Direct-Drive-Turntable-Cartridge-Pre-Mounted/dp/B001JY9MB4/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1371828782&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=stanton+turntable) which got pretty decent reviews.

-Do any of you use controllers with motorized platters, and if so can you tell a noticeable difference when it comes to scratching and mixing?  I know the Numark N7 has spinning platters for its controller, and it's something I'm intrigued by.  Other than the N7, I'm not really familiar with other controllers that offer the same sort of option (even though I believe I've seen some Stanton CDJs which have motorized platters, I'm trying to stick to controller options).

-With all things considered (price, functionality, overall DJing experience), what are your thoughts of a digital vinyl setup vs. a controller?  I know this is a bit of an opinionated question, but I'd like to hear others' firsthand experiences.



With a setup of two decent turntables, a solid mixer, and purchasing Traktor Scratch, I know upgrading to turntables is going to cost a pretty penny, so I'm wondering if I should save up some dough and go for that, or if I should check out some more controller options instead.

I think I did a better job of experimenting with different FX like Reverb and different filters. For my next mix, I think I need to choose my song progression a bit better. There is also one transition that seems a little out of sync, but that may just be my ears having listened to the final product too much. This was made on the Traktor DJ app for iPad like the last one. 

Any and all criticism would be greatly appreciated!

After having been techno/house fans for a very long time, my buddy and I have finally decided to make the jump and start DJing ourselves.

Now we're searching eBay and the like for two players and a mixer so we can start our thing.

Problem is, neither of us are exactly sure what the best starting combination would be. He has a little bit of experience, I have none, and we are mainly checking out older/used Pioneer models - such as two CDJ-900s with a DJM-700 in between, because Pioneer seems to be a good brand.

Any recommendations from you guys? Our starting budget is about 1500$, and the mixer should have four inputs so we can add more components later without having to buy a new mixer.

Other tips concerning how to get started are also appreciated. Thanks!",,False,self,t5_2syix,False,,,True,t3_1f1flx,http://www.reddit.com/r/Beatmatch/comments/1f1flx/whats_the_best_playermixer_combination_for_two/,
1369427139.0,4,self.Beatmatch,1ezq5w,"Is there a way to record not the audio from my mix, but the midi sequences from my Traktor S4? Details inside.",5,1,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/Beatmatch/comments/1ezq5w/is_there_a_way_to_record_not_the_audio_from_my/,"So once in awhile I do a little live show for my friends. What I usually do is make a mix before-hand, then stream it live with small talkbreaks from me over it, etc.

Thing is this - I'd love to actually do it live, but I also need to be able to listen back to the mix later (big tip especially for beginners: record your mixes and listen back to them often, you're your own worst critic and you'll think of things to do differently next time).

Only thing with doing it live is that I don't want the recording of the mix to have my talkbreaks, drops, etc. Not only would it I'm sure be cringe-worthy to listen to later, I want to offer a download of the mix without the interruptions for later listening.

So one remedy for this would be a setup where maybe the mic is plugged into a mixer, which outputs to a second computer is used to stream the mix, and Traktor records itself. This isn't ideal because Traktor also broadcasts the artist and title of each track, and this would be lost.

So I had this idea (also the**TL;DR**): Is there a way to record not the audio, but what I *do* on the S4, including loading of tracks, etc (this is all done on the S4 with the browse button etc), such that the mix could be ""rendered"" later? This would give me the best of both worlds.

The problem is, i'm still not getting any reaction from ANY promoter really, am I not good enough yet to gig or?

Also is the track selection too mainstream? Did I take too many mainstream tracks? Maybe that's my problem..

Anyway, let me know in the comments! :D Any kind of feedback/criticism is welcome.

I want to have all powered/active speakers because I feel its cheaper and less cumbersome (but I'm willing to listen if you suggest active ones with proper amps). In particular, I was thinking picking up 2 Behringer B212d's.

What I need help with is finding:
1. powerful and affordable sub
2. mixer to connect them all
3. wires to connect the speakers and sub to the mixer
4. connecting the mixer to my dj controller

Help with any of these things is really appreciated. Also, if you have any alternative suggestions for PAs of similar quality to the B212d for cheaper, im all ears.

I got my kontrol F1 two days ago. I went on straight away and spliced 16 songs in to stems to build my first full remix set. There are a few mistakes here and there, and sometimes there's 4 stems playing at once, so it might get a bit messy for a very short wile. The last drop also missed one beat due to a mistake in my timing, but in the end, it turned out ok. I am planning to replay and record a clean edit of this over the weekend when i got the time.

However, for now. I would appreciate any feedback on anything! I just love the way how one can sequence songs in unconventional manner. I am also not too used to using just filters instead of EQ's when transitioning, so would appreciate any help on how to do it better for the next one. (rearrangement/volume levels/filtering etc.)


edit: added linky.

edit2: I recommend to avoid opening with VLC, i had some huge audio distortion problems for an unknown reason, which appeared on no other player. (this can partially be fixed by changing the audiomodule to win32, but the track was still clipping sometimes, which again, appears on no other player than VLC...)

Additionally, does anyone know if there is a way to adjust the filter curves in F1?, as they seem to react way too sharply when i twist them.

I've been watching several sets from Ultra and I always noticed that a bunch of newcomers to the EDM scene (ie Avicii, Alesso, Hardwell) likes to twist what seems to be two - four EQ knobs during live performances. As a beginner DJ I get very confused because whenever they do these twisting motions, they aren't mixing anything, they're not scratching, they're not adding effects and they don't have headphones on in the first place.

Take for example this [clip](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwlHlzjdPi0) from Alesso's set. He even states that this is his last song. What the hell is he twisting the knobs for? 
However, when comparing to more experienced DJ's such as Carl Cox or Laidback Luke, they don't do anything like that for all I've seen.

Am I misinterpreting/misunderstanding something about the DJM's or is this part of some sort of elaborate acting to make it look like the DJ is doing something?",,False,self,t5_2syix,False,,,True,t3_1bwo7l,http://www.reddit.com/r/Beatmatch/comments/1bwo7l/twisting_knobs_unnecessary_or_useful/,

Just submitting a cross genre mix I've been putting together over the past few days. Goes from a chilled, liquid vibe into a heavier deep/neurofunk vibe for the second half. I think overall the transitions are pretty solid apart from a bit of a slip up with my cueing around the (26.40) mark, but I correct it quite quickly. I also struggled with the transitions into and out of 'Be True' by Commix but after all the experimentation I really like the final result. One issue is that I feel that I leave some tracks in the mix just a bit too long. 

I'd love some outside feedback from others!

0:00 - In the Hall of the Mountain King - Edvard Grieg (Deficio Remix)

4:21 - Taito - Mord Fustang [transition ends at 5:20]

10:18 - Gypsy - Steve Angello [transition starts at 9:47]

16:10 - Wild Trichitillomania Crush (Nero, Feed Me, Sia) [Commandah Panda Mashup] [Transition begins 15:45]

19:54 - Monkey See Monkey Do - Tommy Trash (Tommy's Re-Edit) [Transition begins around 19:40]

22:13 - Fur Elise - Beethoven (Deficio Remix) 

24:55 - Shrunken Heads - Wolfgang Gartner [Transition begins 24:10]

28:57 - Channel 42 - Deadmau5 &amp; Wolfgang Gartner [Transition begins 28:38]

I would say biggest weakness is maybe how long some transitions were,but also sometimes I like to let the progression do its work - this is obviously not the kind of set I would put on at a club or party, but it's more structured for listening at home, which is why I tend to let some songs play out more. Would appreciate any comments on harmonics, technical mixing style, anything really. Thanks!

I tried to have a ""give/take"" with the feel of the mix (""mellow"" periods balanced with ""high energy"" periods).
Finally, I cringed to a couple of my mistakes - but that's good! I won't make them again.

I went to check out the club yesterday. Its Tantra in Philly http://i.imgur.com/63J51j2.jpg and I'll be spinning EDM of all sorts, plus some hip hop. I didn't have a camera on me unfortunately but will be taking LOADS of pictures of my setup and such on Tuesday.

To my surprise, the place had a nice mixer behind the DJ stand, which includes laptop stand, and RCA cables to hookup to (but I will be bringing XLR and other cables as backup or such). There is a control panel above it which controls the strobe lights and lasers. I've never used one of those but it should be fun to try out. I've never used a separate mixer because I use a midi controller.

One issue has already come up. Last weekend, my buddy spilled beer on my controller, so the right side is fucked for now (my FX mode/loop control button is fucked, and the pitch fader slid off from its normal coordination). So I will be using a Mixtrack Pro, opposed to my [Hercules DJ RMX 2](http://i.imgur.com/LoxCO.jpg). 

Any advice on using professional lasers? I've only really used fog machines with some lower-end laser systems and kept them on auto most of the time.

Do you guys think there will be that much of a difference? I'll be using my same software (either Virtual DJ LE 7 or Cross DJ 2.3)

How are they finding clear vocals? Is there some EQ they have set to bring the vocals out? Or do they actually go finding the acapella's for these tracks and have them on Deck 1 while Deck 2 is playing the instrumental of another song. I'm confused because even acapellas4u sometimes doesn't have these extremely recent vocals, so I'm wondering if there's another tactic to extract the vocals out...

Like the title says I got my camera out and put together this video instead of just posting the mix so hopefully you might be able to pick up a technique or two. This way we all can learn :D.

This was my first real recorded mix with large BPM changes (128-&gt;174-&gt;120) which was quite challenging but good fun.

There was a bit of manual beatmatching to be done in some parts which makes it interesting :D.

I know the timing of Satisfaction went a little out about 5 seconds after I pressed play. I have no idea why but I tried re-recording and I still couldn't get it perfect. I think Rollup had a beat change during the transition :(.

I think all the songs are pretty fun (You get that with top 40 I suppose) and danceable. Feel free to download it too if you like.

I've been messing around with mixing for about a year so I could have CDs in my car and put them on mp3 for when I'm exercising. Now I'm starting to get a bit more serious about actually trying to DJ and thought it was time to share my mixes. I really love this style of trance music characterized by a deep growling bassline, usually a good groove, and progressive-style chords and melodies. All the songs are 126-132 BPM.

I didn't do any crazy mixing and let the songs play out to really let the listener fall into the vibes of each song.  I tried to have it start off a bit darker and deeper as it builds into some more pounding beats with the Aaron Camz remix, then the melodies start to get a bit more anthemic and emotional to finish the mix starting with Solid Stone - Surge.

This is my first mix where I messed with having hits from the one of the songs play over the other during transitions. I did this at [22:11] with percussion from Necromancy, [27:41] and [33:00] with the percussion from As The Tables Turn, and [52:03] with the melody from Signet coming in early. Otherwise on transitions I just beatmatch them and use some EQ to get them to overlay well without clashing too much.

Let me know what you think of the style of songs selected and the overall flow of the mix, as well as if any of the transitions sound excessively choppy or forced.

Im struck between getting an s4 or getting a Kontrol z2 paired with a x1.  Right now I am favoring the z2 paired with the x1 because I would like to get into dvs and get a more tactile feel than you can really get with a controller. That being said I have not been able to play around with the z2 so Im not sure if it will be suitable for what I want. I have however been able to play around and mix with a s4 and I know that the s4 has so many capabilities. So Im really looking for opinions on both of the options Im currently looking at, or even new suggestions. I have right around  $1000 to work with.

Took a bit of playing around but I managed to get it all hooked up and like you said, it's just a big splitter really.
