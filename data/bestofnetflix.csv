If you're like me, you probably scrolled right on over this one without really giving it a chance. You probably remember it being in theaters and thinking: 
""Another one? Seriously?""
You probably remember the first Scream, and how awesome it was at the time. And maybe vaguely remember the second one, and that it had some sort of a twist ending. I have no memory of number Three, though I know I watched it. 
You probably see my point. The series was pretty much over and the thought of another doesn't sound appetizing. Scream had ran its course, a solid trilogy, but no more. At least that's what I thought. 
The is movie was so awesome that the club can't even handle it right now. Wes Craven really outdid himself on this one. I won't get into any details, because this movie kept me guessing through and through, anything I could mention might sway your suspicions about characters, and for me trying to figure the killer is part of the experience. No spoilers, it had possibly the best death via stabbing I've ever seen. By the end I was on the edge of my seat, flailing and gasping like an idiot. It just kept delivering. 
If you're on the fences about this one, or are in a mood for an amazing slasher/thriller movie, this is it.

Brendan Fraser stars as David Greene, a working-class Jewish quarterback from Scranton, Pennsylvania, who is offered a senior year scholarship to a prestigious New England academy. It's David's ticket to an Ivy League education and a way out of his Rust Belt hometown, but there's one condition: the school's elders ask him to be discreet about his religion. At first willing to do so, David struggles with his silence about his faith as his popularity grows. David strikes up a friendship with his roommate Chris Reece (Chris O'Donnell) and a possible romance with Sally Wheeler (Amy Locane), a student at a nearby girls' school. When jealous classmate Charlie Dillon (Matt Damon) learns David's secret at an alumni party, he exposes the school's new gridiron hero, and David faces the full force of religious intolerance from the prejudiced WASP institution. Also featuring early performances from Ben Affleck, Anthony Rapp, and Cole Hauser, School Ties was loosely based on the real-life experiences of producer Dick Wolf, creator of TV's popular series Law &amp; Order. ~ Karl Williams, Rovi",,False,,t5_2s1cv,False,,,True,t3_1ap98w,http://www.reddit.com/r/bestofnetflix/comments/1ap98w/school_ties_a_young_brendon_fraser_plays_a_1950s/,

I am 20 years old and watched the entirety of the series between February 10th and March 6th of this year and I hope that goes to show you just how fantastic this series really is.

I know it may not be a show that interests a lot of people but there is a single episode of this show that I think absolutely everyone must watch at least once.

Following the attacks of September 11, 2001 Aaron Sorkin, the creator of ""The West Wing,"" wrote a response episode entitled ""[Isaac and Ishmael] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_and_Ishmael)"" This episode was conceived, written, filmed, approved, and finally aired on October 3 2001, only 22 days after the world came to a grinding halt for millions of people. On Netflix this particular show is listed as Season 3 Episode 01 even though it does not technically occur in the same timeline as the rest of the series.

Even if you've never seen The West Wing, even if you have no interest in politics, even if you haven't been even the slightest bit affected by the bombings in Boston or the wars in the Middle East I highly encourage you to watch this incredible work of art. [I promise that you won't regret it.](http://movies.netflix.com/WiPlayer?movieid=70262127&amp;trkid=3325854&amp;t=The+West+Wing%3A+Ssn+3%3A+Isaac+and+Ishmael)",,False,,t5_2s1cv,False,,,True,t3_1coylr,http://www.reddit.com/r/bestofnetflix/comments/1coylr/in_light_of_what_has_happened_in_boston/,

1368180627.0,28,self.bestofnetflix,1e27nr,Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated breathes new life into a classic while staying faithful to the reasons you loved it in the first place.,38,10,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/bestofnetflix/comments/1e27nr/scooby_doo_mystery_incorporated_breathes_new_life/,"It's an updating done right for the most part. 

**Summary:**

It takes place in the first years of being Mystery Inc. There hometown makes all it's money off of tourism from being the most haunted place in the country so people don't like the meddling kids so much as try to tolerate them. They're also trying to find out what happened to the original Mystery Inc who mysteriously vanished as teenagers.

**Why it works:**
 
* The plot is genuinely interesting and works very well as a prequel. They are able to have the cliche formulaic adventures associated with the show while providing a very lite but interesting arc that works well in the modern times and might hook you.

* The humor is great. It's funniest jokes come from self-parody out of respect and homage similar to A Pup Named Scooby Doo while still adding some of it's own flavor humor-wise. 

* For the most part, comedy and atmosphere is mixed as well as the original show.

* Countless horror references and parodies that older viewers will get and enjoy but is still kept in tone for kids to watch. Expect Saw, Twin Peaks, HP Lovecraft, Vincent Van Ghoul as a Vincent Price equivalent, and that kind of stuff to show up.

* The animation takes inspiration from 70's colors and the classic series' backgrounds but makes it more angled, cinematic, and colorful. It strikes the right feeling of old, faithful, and familiar but new, sleeker, and refreshing and just interesting. Some of the backgrounds are beautiful on it's own. Characters are strictly retro though.

* It has cameos from countless Hanna Barbera cartoons. There's even an episode where Scooby, Jibber Jab, Captain Caveman, and Speed Buggy team up. There are more characters in other episodes.

* Casey Kasem, the original voice Shaggy has retired. Matthew Lillard, who played Shaggy in the live-action movies, replaced him and seems like a natural fit. Kasem still provides his voice for Shaggy's dad in a few episodes. The original Fred *is still* voicing Fred and is now voicing Scooby. Patrick Warburton(Kronk from Emperor's New Groove, Rules of Engagement) does hilarious voice over work as the town Sheriff. Not to mention Lewis Black playing the part of Mister E, a guy involved in the show long arc. 

Basically, it's just great at balancing everything and updating it for the times while not straying too far from the roots that we love it for.

**Disclaimer:**
The great outweigh the bad but I do have to mention Daphne and Fred pair up but it kind off feels natural. Shaggy and Velma are a couple for a bit which just doesn't work and they focus too much time on it but the writers thankfully end that.

I know this will be a deal breaker for some so I had to mention it or at least recommend checking out a later episode first. ",,False,,t5_2s1cv,1368183864.0,,,True,t3_1e27nr,http://www.reddit.com/r/bestofnetflix/comments/1e27nr/scooby_doo_mystery_incorporated_breathes_new_life/,

1. It has to be streaming on Netflix (obviously that's why I'm here)

*Set in and around Galway on Ireland's rugged western coast, Ken Bruen's bestselling crime novels leap to life in this series of TV movies featuring Jack Taylor, an alcoholic cop-turned-private-investigator who runs his new business from a barstool.*

I enjoyed the 3 episodes Netflix has up, sadly there are 5 episode but Netflix only as the first 3 but not to worry these three are quite entertaining. I don't want to say too much because you basically get the gist of the show from the given description but aside from that i really liked the color grade of the show and the overall feeling i got but i also enjoy ""little european films"" that follow in the same style as this such as *The Guard* or *Perrier's Bounty*

Plus, if you are a fan of Jorah Mormont from Game of Thrones, the actor Iain Glen is the leading man in this show and don't expect him sound anything like he does in GoT.  He fully embraces a thick Irish or his native Scottish accent (i can't tell, either way it's super thick and thoroughly enjoyable.)

I watched this not knowing what to expect and was immediately drawn in by its animation style.

Also does a sub-reddit like this exist for Canadians?  

I'm not going to link these, just looks 'em up and see if you have 'em. 

* Transformers Dark of the Moon: I know this isn't necessarily great but it's dumb fun and if you need something cool to look at give it a go. 
 
* Thor: I found this to be pretty boring but if you need to do your homework for The Avengers, it's on Netflix. 

* Unstoppable: Fun intense action about a unmanned run away train. 

* Never let Me Go: Good movie, well reviewed with some neat sci-fi principles. 

* Midnight in Paris: A Woody Allen rom-com with a 92% on RT.

* Misfits: A UK series kind of like Heroes and really good. Only has one season, so if you end up hooked you will have to find other ways to see the other seasons

* Justified: Really cool show, which is in the 3rd season now, but we only have season 1. I think the episodes are out of order so be careful and do some looking online to figure out the order. 

* Win Win: A comedy drama starring Paul Giamatti and got a 94% on RT.

Hopefully you are old enough to understand what is going on in the movie. If not, you may not follow the underlining context with a lot of the dialog. But, still give it a shot.

I gave this 5 of 5 on Netflix due to the fact it is the first of its kind I've seen so far. 

Movie may make you cringe and keep you on your toes.

Look how frequently this sub gets a solid submission! No, I refuse to endorse this kind of half-assed service with a totally subpar selection. I signed up for the trial about 2-3 weeks ago and aside from House of Cards, which IS fantastic, I've been very hard pressed to find content worth watching. I will not subsidize shitty content that I don't care about. That's why I dropped cable. I feel like Netflix is just trying to ease their audience into this weak sauce, without making any attempt to up the ante aside from ONE original show, when they should be in the business of shrewdly acquiring all the other networks' content, which their former rental competition had no problems with, nor do they probably wrestle with on the physical media side of their business.
