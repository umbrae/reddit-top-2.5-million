When we have new users there is always a chance that they are a scammer. Most of the times they aren't, but it doesn't hurt to do a little background check.

User /u/GagagaGunman recently made a trade thread. His first, in fact. His account is eight days old. In his post he made it a point to mention that he was in the same area code as /u/Yugz. Hmmmm.

I looked through Gunmans binder, and noticed a striking resemblance to Yugz's binder. The camera quality was also the same, but hey, a lot of people have dark binders and bad cameras.

I then decided to look through his comments.

- Douchebags, If you're known to be annoying/rude/disrespectful you probably won't get it.

[Warning: Giant Wall of Text],162,24,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/comments/1e587l/did_you_know_about_the_naming_sense_behind_the/,"So, Numbers Hunters. Did you know that there’s a reason behind the numbering of each and every Number monster? I got curious and did a bit of searching after being unable to figure out a few of them that were announced in the set yesterday. So I found a [website]( http://staringatthesunneta.cocolog-nifty.com/blog/2012/08/post-3f79.html) that explains all the reasoning behind assigning certain numbers to certain Xyz monsters. I’m pleasantly surprised at the amount of hidden references and jokes that Takahashi put in, as I thought they were all just simple puns. It’s actually quite a good read, so I hope my translation (and some input) will be enjoyable as the original.


---

**Number 6: Chonomaly Atlandis**

-	Atlantis is one of six sunken continents.

-	The other Chronomaly Xyz is Number 33, and 3+3=6.


**Number 7: Lucky Straight**


-	Lucky number 7.

**Number 8: Heraldic Beast Genom-Heritage**


-	“08” can be read as “oya” in Japanese, meaning “father,” which Tron is to the three siblings in the WDC arc of ZEXAL.

-	The number 8 resembles a double helix.


**Number 9: Dyson Sphere**


-	“9” is read as “kyuu” in Japanese, which is a homophone for the word for sphere, 球(also read kyuu)

**Number 10: Illumiknight**


-	Illumiknight glows with neon, which has an atomic number of 10 on the periodic table.

-	It is the first “Number” Xyz monster used by Kaito/Kite Tenjo in ZEXAL. When you break down his Japanese name, all four syllables mean “10” in some way or other.


Kai -&gt; X -&gt; Roman numeral 10. Potentially a reference to [this manga]( http://myanimelist.net/manga/575/X_Kai).


To -&gt; Tou -&gt; 10 in Japanese


Ten  -&gt; 10 in English


Jo -&gt; 10 in Japanese 


**Number 11: Big Eye**


-	11 resembles Roman numeral II. The optic nerve in the human brain is also referred to Cranial Nerve II, hence, Big Eye.

**Number 12: Crimson Shadow Armor Ninja**


-	A reference to the anime [Akakage]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akakage). In episode 12 of Akakage, a crimson-armored ninja appears.

**Number 15: Gimmick Puppet – Giant Grinder**


-	Used by IV(Quattro in the dub) in ZEXAL. IV -&gt; I V -&gt; 1 5

**Number 16: Shock Master**


-	We have to look at its Japanese name to get it, which is “Number 16: Ruler of Color – Shock Ruler.” 

-	“16” can be read as “iro,” which is a homophone for color (色, also read “iro”)


**Number 17: Leviathan Dragon**


-	Thomas Hobbes’ book, [Leviathan]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leviathan_%28book%29), was written in 1651, so in the 17th century. Hence, Number 17.

**Number 19: Freezadon**


-	Its twin, Volcasaurus, is Number 61. 19 upside down is 61.

-	In the 19th century, Neptune was discovered.


**Number 20: Giga-Brilliant**


-	All Numbers Kaito use in the anime are multiples of 10.

-	“Giga” means one billion, and the Japanese name “Buririanto” is a portmanteau of “Brilliant,” “Billion,” and “Ant.” 


-	One billion (or ten *oku* if counted in Japanese) x2 = 20*oku*. Hence, Number 20.

**Number 25: Force Focus**


-	“25” can be read as “niko” in Japanese, a reference to the camera company Nikon.

**Number 30: Acid Golem of Destruction**


-	Kaito uses it, so it’s a multiple of 10.

-	30, read “sanjuu” in Japanese, is a homophone with “three weights,” representing the three drawbacks to using Acid Golem (self-burn, no special summoning, and no attacking).


**Number 32: Shark Drake**


-	In the 32-episode anime [Konpeki no Kantai]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konpeki_no_Kantai),
 there is a ship called the Kouryuu (鮫龍) whose name literally means “Shark Dragon.” Hence, Number 32: Shark Drake.



**Number 33: Chonomaly Machu Mech**


-	In Machu Picchu, it is said that there are 40 layers of terraced fields that are each 3 meters taller than the other.

-	The user in the anime is III. III -&gt; 3 -&gt; 33.


**Number 34: Terror-Byte**


-	“34” can be read as “sanyo,” as in the electronics company Sanyo.


**Number 39: Utopia**


-	Nobody really knows why it’s 39. There are a lot of interpretations.

-	One is that “39” (mijuukyuu) sounds like “mijuku,” which means “inexperienced.” Yuma fits the bill.


-	One is that “39” can be read as “miku,” which means “future.” Also, if you’ve ever seen Hatsune Miku references in Utopia artwork, this is why.

**Number 40: Gimmick Puppet of Strings**


-	User is IV. 40. Yeah.

**Number 42: Starship Galaxy Tomahawk**


-	A reference to [Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy).

-	“42” can be read “shifu,” which can be rewritten into “shippu,” or “ship.”

- Taken one step further, ""shifu"" can be interpreted as ""shippuu,"" meaning ""whirlwind,"" which is why it's WIND. (Courtesy of Gratzi_Pod)


**Number 44: Sky Pegasus**


-	In episode 44 of the anime [Saint Seiya]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Seiya), the main character uses the Pegasus zodiac sign to do some shit. I dunno, I haven’t seen Saint Seiya.

**Number 47: Nightmare Shark**


-	“47” can be read as “Shina.” The Japanese term for the East China Sea is “Higashi Shina Kai.”

**Number 50: Blackship of Corn**


-	“50” can be read as “go-o,” which can sound like “ko-on (corn).” I’m not really buying this one.

**Number 53: Heart-EartH**


-	“53” is read as “gomi,” a homophone for “trash.” This is a reference to the fact that Dr. Faker uses 3 Garbage Lords to Xyz summon it.

-	5x3, since it takes 3 Lv5s to summon.


**Number 56: Gold Rat**


-	A reference to the book of Samuel in the bible. Verses 5 and 6 involve a golden mouse.


**Number 61: Volcasaurus**


-	61 is 19 upside-down as mentioned earlier.

-	Its user is named “Rokuoh.” “6” is read as “roku.” So far, so good, but there’s a really roundabout way of explaining the “1.” The “oh” in “Rokuoh” is read as “wang” in Chinese, which is then pronounced as “wan” in Japanese, which sounds like the English “one.”


**Number 63: Shamoji Soldier**


-	A shamoji is a rice scoop. You probably have one if you own a rice cooker.

-	63 is a reference to the famous restaurant, “Rokusantei” in the Ginza district of Tokyo.


**Number 65: Judge Buster**


-	“65” can be read “mugo,” which sounds like “mugoi,” which means cruel or merciless.

-	The movie, Last Judgment, was released in 1965.


**Number 66: Master Key Beetle**


-	The number 6 (roku in Japanese), can sound like either “rock” or “lock.”

-	The first 6 means Rock. It is a beetle in reference to The Beatles.


-	The second 6 means Lock, in reference to its effect.

**Number 69: Heraldry Emblem**


-	69, or “rokujuukyuu” in Japanese sounds like the Japanese pronunciation of the word “logic.”

**Number 72: Chariot-Hisha**


-	A reference to the game of Chess. The rook is also called the chariot in some variants, and to have it in the 7th rank from the player (the 2nd rank from the opponent) is a very advantageous situation.

**Number 74: Master of Blades**


-	Konami really jumped the gun on this one, releasing a Number before it is announced in Japanese magazines. 

-	“74” can be read as “nashi,” which sounds like “Nasch,” one of the seven Barian Lords who has yet to appear in ZEXAL.

-  7 (shichi) + 4 (shi) + ""Master of Blades"" could be a possible reference to the shichishito (seven branched sword). (Courtesy of Gratzi_Pod)


**Number 83: Galaxy Queen**


-	“083” can be read as “obasan,” which means “aunt” or “lady” in Japanese.

**Number 85: Crazy Box**


-	“85” is read “hako,” a homonym for “box.”


**Number 87: Queen of the Night**


-	The website says “87” is a pun on “hana,” which means “flower.”

-	I personally think that the 87 should be read as “yana” instead, since “ya (夜)” means “night.” 



-	Not sure what the “na” is doing though.


**Number 88: Gimmick Puppet of Leo**


-	In the anime, IV summons this out of desperation to prove himself to his father. “88” can be read “papa” in Japanese. Papa means papa. Derp.


-	Disney’s “The Lion King” runs for 88 minutes.

**Number 91: Thunder Spark Dragon**


-	“91” looks like “qi” when written.[ Qi is more or less The Force in Chinese martial arts.]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qi)


**Number 92: Heart-EartH Dragon**


-	“92” can be read “kuzu,” which is another word for trash. (see above for Number 53)

**Number 96: Dark Mist**


-	“96” is a homonym for “kuro,” which means “black.”

**Number 102:  Holy Lightning – Glorious Halo**


-	Another Saint Seiya reference. There are 12 (10+2) Zodiac signs. Well, not counting Ophiucus. Fuck you, Ophiucus.

**Number 104: Masquerade Magician: Shining**


-	In Khachaturian’s play, [Masquerade]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masquerade_%28Khachaturian%29), there is a masquerade ball in Act 10 Scene 4.

**Number 105: Burning Knuckler Star Cestus**


-	No, I will not call them Battlin’ Boxers.


-	There are 15(10+5) volumes in the manga [Kentou Ankoku Den Cestus]( http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%8B%B3%E9%97%98%E6%9A%97%E9%BB%92%E4%BC%9D%E3%82%BB%E3%82%B9%E3%82%BF%E3%82%B9).


**Number 106: Giant Hand**


-	Same as Number 66, the 6 means “lock” in reference to its effect.

-	“Hundred” is pronounced “Handoreddo” in Japanese, so literally “106” means “Hand Lock”.
-	Its Chaos Xyz form, Giant Hand Red, is a pun on “Giant Hundred.”


**Number 107: Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon**


-	There are 10^7 stars in a small galaxy, so 107.

My roommate plays Six Samurai, and recently he's been winning a lot with first turn Shi En's. He told me Kagemusha of the Six Samurai was his favorite card. 

His girlfriend and I decided to play a prank on him by buying 40 Kagemusha of the Blue Flame's. Then, when we went to class, she'd make sure his door was unlocked. I went into his room and replaced his deck and resleeved all 40 Kagemusha's and hid his real deck in my room. 
Now, I had to figure out a way so he would only see the Kagemusha's after we did our initial hand deal. When he asked me to duel him, and put his deckbox on the table, I knew I had to think fast. So I said ""how about we ban five cards from eachother's decks, make it a bit more interesting?"". He was a bit skeptical but couldn't resist the chance to remove Magics from my deck. So I put five Kagemusha's face down and he put five cards from mine face down. Then I power shuffled his deck and he shufffled mine. 




We drew 5 cards from eachother's decks and set them on the table. He won the rock paper scissors and drew one more. 





He picked up his six cards and I just saw his eyes widen. The look of confusion was hilarious right before the embarrassment sunk in. He ran into his room and slammed his door while I died of laughter. After about a minute he came out and looked through the deck, assuming I just replaced the first few cards. He started crying of laughter when he saw that all 40 cards were Kagemusha of the Blue Flame. Best Yu-Gi-Oh! prank ever.

I think it's one of the, if not *the* most important aspect of competitive yugioh, and it distinguishes the X-0 from the droppers. Anyone can just pick up a tournament winning netdeck and learn how to play it, but they still won't win. It's knowing how to side deck properly, read your opponent, and *counter*side effectively that will have you as victor in the end. This is why a lot of tournament winners won't post their side deck when they release their main deck; it's their secret weapon that probably owed more to their win than their main deck did. 

As an example throughout this guide I will be using my Kagetokage Evilswarm deck and it's side; shown [here](http://i.imgur.com/eUjpIr3.png). 


**-Forward-**

If you notice a lot of the top decks in the current meta at the moment, they're all practically the same, albeit one or two tech choices. There's a reason for this. The yugioh community has tested and perfected the ""perfect"" Mermail deck, or the ""perfect"" E-Dragon deck. These are the standard builds, and they're consistent and reliable. I cannot stress this enough; *there is nothing wrong with playing a standard build*. Just because someone else plays the same deck or thought of it before you, does not make you less creative or a worse player. Many people play these standard builds because after getting comfortable with them in testing, they find they like them much, much better than what they were playing previously. People who hate on players because ""huh huh, you're just playing a meta net deck you're just so desperate to win you're not a good player at all I built my Skull Servants from scratch and they are infinitely better than the re-used expensive garbage you're playing"" are a disease on the game. They are just as bad as the ""Oh you only started reading Game of Thrones after you watched the series, you're not a true fan"" hipsters. Ignore them.

A deck is meta because it wins a lot. Sorry to break this to you guys, but if Madolche were really *that* good, they'd be topping tournaments in both the OCG and TCG at the moment. I'm not trying to insult anyone. There is nothing wrong with playing ""lower tier"" decks (I hate calling them that). If you want to play ""casual"" decks, no one is stopping you; it is a game after all and you're there to have fun.

But please stop complaining about not winning because ""meta decks are too broken"". These are the decks that are the best at the moment and competitive players want to *win*, which is why they take out $600 to pay for a Dragon Ruler deck. If you want to *win* you have to two options;

1. Pay a fuck ton of money and buy yourself a Meta deck **and learn to use it properly**

2. Come up with some crazy new tech or deck idea that wipes the floor with everything Meta at the moment.

The problem with number 2 is; it's already been tried. Once a crazy, original idea (Bubble Beat, Quickdraw Dandy) has been realised by the community as being *awesome* it **becomes the meta**. This is how good decks are incepted. I'm sorry to say, but if your ShapesnatchChaosOjamaOTK was *really* that good, you'd be seeing deck profiles of Jeff Jones's version on TCGplayer around about now.

Original decks don't win, because if they did, they wouldn't be original. Get used to that idea.

-**The Theory** -  

Alright now my rant is over and you've (hopefully) come down to earth and learned the true nature of this game; let's talk business. 

You know that ""standard"" deck I was talking about before? Everyone knows what it is, and because of that; it's easy to side against. For example let me give you a ""[standard](http://i.imgur.com/k9Lvmwu.jpg)"" Dragon Ruler deck. I'm not saying it's good, it's just what a lot of players are playing at the moment. Some people might only play 1 star sword, an extra sarc, LaDD, drop the hole etc. But this is what you come to expect. Thus you know what to side for it. Random rogue tech (like ""Obelisk the Tormentor"") might really throw you off. 


**Only side for the Meta.**

I can't stress this enough. There is no room in your side deck to waste against tier 2/3 decks that won't top. You want to be at the top tables throughout your whole tournament, and so you'll be meeting the meta consistently. You *need* a full arsenal against them. Siding ""System Down"" for Gadgets or D.D. Crow for Frogs is not worth it when that space can go to another side option against Prophecy or Mermail. For example; in my Evilswarm deck, which is already Anti-Meta as it is I have; 

* 9 Side Deck cards against Dragon Rulers
* 4 Side Deck cards against Prophecy ( 7 if you consider Veiler) and 3 Main deck.
* 7 Side Deck cards against Mermail
* 2 Side Deck cards against Mirror/Fire Fist (or 5 if you consider Veiler).

I haven't sided for Gadgets, Hieratics, Sams, Karakuri, Agent, Chaos Dragons or any other non Tier 1 deck. There is just no space, and my main deck should be able to deal with most of that anyway. 

""But what about ""Chain Burn"" and other troll decks... what am I supposed to do about them?"" I hear you say. Simple. You lose.

At every major tournament you're going to need X-2 to top. The chances of you coming across a rogue deck that ruins your day is slim, but if you do (and you haven't got the side for it) you're probably going to lose. I know that with my Evilswarm if I came across Watts I'd be pretty fucked. I have absolutely no backrow or stall removal. That doesn't matter to me. As long as I gear my deck up to win *every other match* (which will most likely be Meta) that loss doesn't mean much to me. X-1 is still a top. If you're REALLY scared about rogue decks, use up three spaces in your side for ""Malevolent Catastrophe/Royal Decree"". It might hurt your deck, but it hurts theirs more, and might get you the win; they're also flexible enough that they work the same way against all rogue decks.

That won't matter anyway, because you aim to win. And if you win your first few rounds, you'll be at the top tables. And at the top tables there will be no rogue decks; it will just be Meta; and your side deck is ready for it.

**Does it hurt your strategy?**

There's no point siding in Macro Cosmos against ""Mermail"" if you're playing ""Infernity"". There's no point siding Gozen Match against E-Drags if you're playing Wind-Up. Think about your choices carefully.

Do the benefits outweigh the losses?

In my Evilswarm side I have 3 copies of ""Imperial Iron Wall"". With that card up it means I can't play Rescue Rabbit or Evilswarm Kerykion, two of the key cards in the deck. However, in the matchups I side it in for, it works wonders. E-drags can't summon anything except with the babies (and I'll have an Ophion out anyway, hopefully) and they can't use Breakthrough Skill to negate my Ophion. Prophecy won't be able to pop with HPOP or use Spellbook of Life and (my most hated card) Spellbook of Fate.

If a side deck card hurts your deck but completely shuts down your opponents deck; *it is worth siding*.

**Going first or second makes a BIG difference.**

I like the card ""Upstart Goblin"" because it helps speed up how fast I can get Ophion out, and makes easy side-out fodder., but I don't always side it out.

Let's say I just won Game 1 against E-dragons; First of all I will side out my EEV for ""Imperial Iron Wall"" and "" Dark Hole, 1 Pandemic (depending if they're playing Breakthrough or not)"" and maybe 1 ""Kagetokage/Mandrogora"" for ""Effect Veiler"". 

I know I'm going second so I will side out my Upstarts for 3 copies of Maxx ""C"". That way, I can gain multiple draws off of Maxx C when they attempt to get off their first turn Dracossack +LaDD and I have more outs, (Upstart Goblin is just wasted when they have a LaDD out). Hopefully Maxx C will help me draw into a Veiler if I didn't already have one. 

Let's say I lose that game and now I'm going first. My strategy *relies* on Getting out a First Turn Ophion and *stopping* their special summons. Thus, 3 Maxx ""C"" come out and 3 ""Upstart"" go back in. Upstart means I draw into the cards I need quicker for my first turn. If I kept my Maxx C in I might not be able to get an Ophion out.  If I *do* manage to get Ophion out, Maxx C will be dead in my hand as they won't be special summoning any time soon. 

**What you side out is just as important as what you side in.**

A lot of people get excited about their crazy new original side deck choice and forget they actually need to take something out in order for it to work. Think about your deck and ask yourself what you can safely side out. For me it would be the EEV, Upstart, Heavy Storm and Kagetokage. The risk of siding out my Upstarts is that I lose consistency, but that might be outweighed by the benefits of the cards I'm siding in.

Remember, siding should not change your overall deck core; your deck should work and play exactly the same way it did before you sided; if you've slowed it down then you've done something wrong (unless of course that was your aim, such as putting in more traps against a stun deck (Macro Rabbit, Fire Fist)). Side cards are *tech* choices against a specific deck first and foremost. Tech should never get in the way of your strategy.

 
**Use Flexible Sides**

I like Veiler and Maxx C as they can be sided against a lot of decks. If I get a Hieratic matchup, Maxx C can pull off the work for me. Veiler works against *everything*. ""Imperial Iron Wall"" however, is pretty dead against anything that's not E-drag or Prophecy.

If you have a choice between a deck specific side (Soul drain, Kycoo, Gozen Match) go for ones that will give you more flexibility (Macro Cosmos, Thunder King, Summon Limit).  

**Consider Counter Siding.**

I've been arguing with myself a lot whether I should include MST in my side but I've decided against it because I just can't find the room. However, if someone flips a ""Rivalry of Warlords"" on me, I might as well scoop right there. I have absolutely no outs save for drawing into Heavy Storm.

I decided against it because you need to remember the Meta Decks at the moment are all siding against each other.  Prophecy are siding heavily for the Mirror/Dragons and Dragons are siding heavily against Prophecy/Dragons. They all have small answers to Ophion in their side but they've dedicated more space to ""more important"" cards. The Prophecy player who flips Rivalry against me will have my utmost respect (and surrender). 

Think about your counter sides. Playing Dark World? You're likely to see Macro Cosmos/D-Fissure/Soul Drain against you in Game 2 and 3. You're going to need a lot of Backrow hate; MST/Twister/Dust Tornado/Malevolant Catastrophe etc.

**Iron out the details**

I had to choose between a second Compuls or a TT. I chose the TT because of Mermail but I'll probably be bouncing around between the two in testing. I'm also unsure whether I should be playing Prideful Roar or Forbidden Lance, I've chosen Roar for now but who knows I might go back to Lance.

Whenever I side in graveyard removal, I have to choose between Macro Cosmos, Dimensional Fissure and Banisher of the Radiance. I love Banisher because it's unexpected and not many people counter side for it (you can't MST a Banisher after all), but Macro Cosmos can be chained and doesn't take up your normal summon, and it can't be run over by higher attack monsters. They're both slightly better than D-Fissure though as they deal with XYZ Material and Fire Fist; but I've opted for D-fissure because it's a better option against a first turn set Mermail Abysslinde; and if I know they're playing Veiler or Maxx C, I can play it and then be safe in the knowledge my Rescue Rabbit is playable. 

At the end of the day you probably won't be 100% satisfied with your side deck but that's okay; no one ever is. You're always going to have that moment where you think ""Oh if only I'd sided -example- I could have won that duel"", but you can say that for anything.

Play what you're comfortable with and don't let other people, or the current trends dictate your build. If your friend says that ""Consecrated Light"" is a great side deck card and he always plays it and you should to, that's great; but if you're not sure about the card, and you're only playing it because your friend topped your last regional with it, you're going to have a bad time. 

Anyway, that's all I can think of for now, I'm sure I've forgotten quite a bit but oh well; I hope someone can take something away from this massive wall of text, it's a result of my hard work finding things out by myself and being taught by my friends who are great at the game.

Thanks a lot for reading.

**Breakdown of Damage Step** (PocketEngi)

My understanding is that the damage step and damage calculation are different. Damage calc is a substep of the damage step. Here's how it works:

*The Damage Step*

1. Begin the damage step

2. Flip up the attack target

3. Before damage calc

4. During damage calc

5. After damage calc 

6. Resolve leftover effects

7. Destroy a monster if applicable

8. End the damage step

**Effects During Phases** (Argor42)

Effects that trigger by phase (such as Gladiator Beast monsters, Fire King High Avatar Garunix's Special Summon effect, Lightsworn monsters that mill at End phase, etc.) do not follow standard SEGOC rules. Instead, they activate and resolve on separate chains. The order these effects can activate depends on who the turn player is, and how priority to activate effects is conducted between the two. 

The order of priority goes:

Turn Player's Mandatory Effects

Opponent's Mandatory Effects

Turn Player's Optional Effects

Opponent's Optional Effects

Priority between players can be passed from one to another, but if both the turn player and opponent pass priority to activate a mandatory effect while both have one to resolve, the turn player must resolve a mandatory effect.

Example 1: Let's say Player A has conducted battle with Gladiator Beast Retiari, Gladiator Beast Bestiari, and Gladiator Beast Laquari during their Battle Phase, and all have survived battle, allowing them to activate their effects at the end of the Battle Phase. Player A is allowed to choose the order in which these effects activate and resolve. So Player A can activate Retiari's effect first to return itself to the Deck and summon a Gladiator Beast monster (if that monster has an effect that triggers when summoned, that effect can activate at that time, before the effects of the other Gladiator Beasts to tag out activate), then after that sequence of events, activate Bestiari's effect to tag out and summon another Gladiator Beast monster, and finally Laquari's effect. The order those effects can activate and resolve is flexible, so it can go Retiari, Bestiari, Laquari; Laquari, Retiari, Bestiari...and so on.

Example 2: Let's say Player A has activated Mind Control to take control of Player B's Wind-Up Zenmaines. During Player A's Main Phase 2, Player B used Effect Veiler to negate the effects of Zenmaines (after Zenmaines applied its Continuous Effect to save itself from destruction by detaching an Xyz Material). Now it is Player A's End Phase. Because Player A at the start of the End Phase controls both Zenmaines as well as the effect of Mind Control (to return control of the monster to the opponent), and because both are mandatory to resolve at the End phase, Player A has priority to activate/resolve one of these. However, Player A can pass priority to Player B to activate/resolve mandatory effects (in this case, Effect Veiler wearing off). If Player B does resolve Effect Veiler in this case, then Player A regains priority to activate/resolve mandatory effects, and can choose to resolve Zenmaines before Mind Control, or Mind Control before Zenmaines. If Player B does not resolve Effect Veiler in this case, then Player A regains priority to activate/resolve mandatory effects, and must at this point choose to resolve either Zenmaines or Mind Control. This is because the effects are mandatory, and game mechanics mandate that if both the turn player and opponent have passed priority to activate/resolve mandatory effects, the turn player must resolve one, so as to not form an infinite loop of priority-passing. This logic also extends to Lightsworn monsters being negated by Effect Veiler at the End Phase.

Example 3: It is Player A's Standby Phase, and Player A activates and resolves the effect of Treeborn Frog. Then, Player A activates Enemy Controller from the Hand, tributing Treeborn Frog to take control of one of Player B's monsters. Since multiple chains can form in the Standby Phase, and since Treeborn Frog has no restriction on how many times it can be used per turn, Treeborn Frog is allowed to reactivate its effect, summoning itself to the Field after Enemy Controller has resolved.

**Missing the Timing**

4 types of effect wording, since we'll keep it simple for now and talk about effects that miss the timing.


Phrasing is the thing to look for.

1) ""If X happens; do Y""

2) ""If X happens; you can do Y""

3) ""When X happens; do Y""

None of these can miss the timing. These three effects start a new chain when the current chain resolves.

1 and 3 mean the same thing but may be written differently on different cards. 
They are both mandatory effects and will be the first links in the new chain, while 2 is optional and will activate after any other mandatory effects.

The last kind is the type of effect that misses the timing:

4) ""When X happens; you can do Y""

What this says is ""If and only if X is the very last thing to happen, you have the option of doing activating Y"".

In 4, if the last thing to happen was NOT X, you are not allowed to do activate Y because it has missed the timing.

Remember that only the activation of an optional effect can miss the timing.

---

**Effect Priority**

First of all, there are two things that are commonly referred to as priority.

Before the 25th of April 2012, ""Ignition Priority"" was allowed. This meant that after you summon a monster that has an Ignition Effect (Lyla, DAD, JD, Chaos Sorcerer, etc.), you get to activate that monster's effect as Chain Link 1 before the opponent is allowed to activate a card like BTH or Torrential Tribute.

Now, if you summon one of these monsters (and others with Ignition Effects) your opponent can BTH them before they activate their effects.

This does NOT apply to Quick Effects or Trigger Effects. If you summon a monster with a Trigger Effect that activates upon summoning, you do that as CL1.

If you summon a monster with a Quick Effect (the kind that says ""once per turn, during either player's turn"", so like Constellar Pleiades) you retain the other kind of priority to use his effect as CL1.
So this other priority is the ability, as Turn Player, to activate an effect before your opponent. So this is where you can activate a Quick Effect after you summon a monster. You can also use a Solemn Warning on your own monster during your turn before your opponent has the chance to use anything.

---

**SEGOC**

This stands for “Simultaneous Effects Go On Chain”, and is used when 2 or more effects meet an activation requirement at the same time.

The order in which these simultaneous effects activate depends on 2 things: whose turn it is, and whether or not the effects are mandatory.

1. Turn Player's Mandatory Effects

2. Non-Turn Player's Mandatory Effects

3. Turn Player's Optional Effects

4. Non-Turn Player's Optional Effects

If a player controls 2 cards of the same category and they activate at the same time, they can choose which to activate first.

E.g. Turn player activates Card Destruction with a Snoww and a Broww in his hand. Both are mandatory effects. He chooses to activate Snoww first.

CL1: Snoww

CL2: Broww

CL2 Resolves: He draws a card

CL1 Resolves: He searches out a card.

In the TCG only, when cards activate at the same time yet they met their conditions at slightly different times, they go on the chain in the order they were triggered.

E.g. Player tributes Sangan to summon Zaborg, the Thunder Monarch. The effects activate at the same time, but since Sangan was sent to the Graveyard first, his effect is CL1 and Zaborg’s is CL2.

---

**Decking Out and Exodia**

Decking Out in the middle of a Chain Link, with all 5 pieces of Exodia, is different to Decking Out in the middle of a Chain with all 5 pieces. 

Example:

P1 activates Heavy Storm.

P2 chains Reckless Greed with 1 card in his deck.

Reckless Greed resolves and he draws the last needed piece of Exodia.

The chain ends there, without Heavy Storm resolving, because he is being forced to draw but 
has no cards left. Even though he has all 5 pieces, he has decked out, and Exodia will not 
obliterate because the game state is in the middle of a card effect. P2 loses.

Example 2:

P1 activates Heavy Storm.

P2 chains Reckless Greed with 2 cards in his deck.

Reckless Greed resolves and he draws the last needed piece of Exodia, and MST.

The chain ends there, without Heavy Storm resolving, because after Chain Link 2 resolves, P2 has fulfilled a win condition and wins.

---

**Summon Negation and Response**

These are two different things that occur at different times. Certain cards can be activated in each, but none in both. It is important to know which go where.

In the Summon Negation Window, the monster in question has not yet been declared ‘successfully summoned’ and so any effects that activate upon its summon DO NOT happen yet.

The only cards that can be activated at this time are cards which specifically say they negate the summon of a monster, such as Thunder King Rai-Oh, Solemn Warning, Solemn Judgment, Steelswarm Roach, and Evolzzar Laggia. 

If no one wishes to activate anything in the Summon Negation Window, it closes, the monster is successfully summoned, and the Summon Response Window is opened.

If the monster’s summon triggers its effect, it goes on the chain now. Then, cards can be activated in response to the successful summon, such as Bottomless Trap Hole, Torrential Tribute, and Compulsory Evacuation Device. 

* Note that for a card to activate first in the Summon Negation Window must have an effect that negates the monster’s summon. After this, other cards can be activated. 

E.g. Player A Special Summons Black Luster Soldier while Royal Oppression is face-up.

Player B activates the effect of Royal Oppression, paying 800 life points

Player A activates MST, and then the chain resolves.

MST destroys Royal Oppression, and since it’s a Continuous Trap and no longer on the field, it cannot resolve. The summon of BLS is successful.

* However, a card does not have to have an effect that only works when a monster is summoned to activate first in the Summon Response Window.

E.g. Player A summons Thunder King Rai-Oh. No one negates, so it moves to the Response Window.

Player B activates Compulsory Evacuation Device, then the chain resolves.

CED resolves and TKRO is returned to the hand.

---

**Miscellaneous**

* Cards in a chain don’t go to the graveyard until the entire chain resolves, or they are moved from the field by a card effect.

* Honest vs. Honest. If Player A attacks Player B, Player A retains Priority to activate an effect. His Honest will drop first. Player B then decides to drop Honest, and the chain resolves from there.

E.g. Player A's Thunder King Rai-Oh attacks Player B's Black Luster Soldier Envoy

CL1 Honest drops on TKRO

CL2 Honest drops on BLS

Resolves

CL2 BLS gains the attack of Rai-Oh, making him 4900 ATK

CL1 Rai-Oh gains the new attack of BLS, making him 6800 ATK.

For any of these damage-step ATK change thingies, just apply turn player priority and then resolve the chains backwards. Any attack change applied in CL2 will be taken into consideration in CL1 unless it says ""original ATK"" or similar.

See the second round writeup.

I don't even know how this could happen. The victim is on the plane on his way home now, so should find out more soon.

He just posted on facebook:

""OK here's the sleeve situation that got me a game loss round 2 and thus costed me an early match. This is 100% factual, none of this is made up or embellished.

In the morning before the event we had a player meeting in the player's room where we would sleeve our decks and hand them to the judges who keep them until we begin round 1. They handed us each two packs of their shitty zexal picture sleeves which only have 50 sleeves per pack even though the game they are made for requires 55 at the bare minimum (70 technically).

I sleeved my entire deck face down because there were other players at the table, and the last 4 cards in my side (the first pack I opened had 51) which happened to be side cards for the mirror match were in sleeves from the second pack. The judges took each player's deck as soon as that player finished sleeving. Unbeknownst to me, my first pack of sleeves' edges were SLIGHTLY different.

Round 2, after I lost game 1, we sided and were shuffling up when we got hit by a (presumably) random deck check. After a while, the HJ asked me to come with him backstage. When I got there, he interrogated me with a bunch of questions like what deck was I playing etc until he finally pulled out some cards and asked if they were the cards I sided. They were. Apparently one of the judges had noticed some slightly different sleeve edges in my deck and managed to pull out my side cards. Based on my entirely truthful answers to his questions, he deemed it wasn't intentional, but because there was a pattern, even if unintentional, the penalty is a game loss. If he had deemed it intentional, it would have been a DQ.

I tried as hard as I could to reason with him until he told me if I kept going I would get more penalties. Obviously I was absolutely furious and it was everything I could do to stop myself from running my mouth or hitting something. Never been more angry in my life but there was nothing I could do about it.

So I got a game loss for something that was 100% out of my control, 100% their fault. Absolute joke.""",,False,self,t5_2rpe6,1376447070.0,,,True,t3_1kbkma,http://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/comments/1kbkma/an_australian_player_got_a_game_loss_at_worlds/,

A little while ago I had an idea - every time I started to play a new deck, I needed to scour the internet for core decklists, specific techs, and most of all, I had to find the plays or discover them myself by slowly using the deck on DN (and annoying my opponents in the process with slow play). There was no place to discover entire decks with all their techs and plays. I decided it was time to end that. Last night I started working on YuGiOh! Playbook! 

YuGiOh! Playbook! is a site that aims to help people jump right into new decks by quickly allowing players to find deck cores, techs, and their plays, based on decktypes, cost, popularity, and other criteria. 

Perhaps you want to find a Mermail deck to run? Undine variant? Mono variant? Atlantean variant? Each page will give quick access to similar decks that run the same cores.

The site aims to eventually allow you to search ""vintage"" decks that were once legal in advanced play. Initially, however, the site will aim to provide information for the current banlist and meta.

While the information and main pages are complete, along with a good part of back end, here's the part that requires a lot of work - database entry. I'm not sure how much help I will be able to find here, but I'm looking for the following:

* Heavy Contributors - Players that know specific deck cores and their most crucial plays, along with popular techs. 
* Images - I need to find an image of every card neatly named by some manner for easy access. I'll possibly be trying to rip them from Wikia later for use on my site.
* Funds - Sites aren't free, and neither is my time. If anyone is interested in seeing this site up sooner feel free to donate. I do have bills to pay. You'll receive a shout-out on the site once it's up.
* Suggestions - Any suggestions to improve the site are appreciated. Currently the site aims to be minimal but informative, so keep that in mind.
* Layout Design - The current layout is simple and nice in my opinion, but I could use someone who is actually decent at design because I'm not very good overall.

That seems to be all for now folks, back to working on the site for a bit!

**EDIT:** Spent a lot of time on the content page. Here's a short example of the layout of the deck pages: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/17275510/sample.png

**EDIT #2:** Database should be setup pretty soon. Content should be starting to roll in tomorrow night and then site should be in Alpha, at which point I'll find a test host and have it up.

**EDIT #3:** YGO Playbook! will be open to deck and play submissions later this week. Remember, cores and plays are the most important. Meta decks will be added first.

**EDIT #4:** No sleep for me! On the last leg of the site before I can start adding content and cleaning up code.

Here's how to not get your stuff stolen.,140,42,65,http://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/comments/1e74v2/i_have_played_since_sdy_i_have_stolen_lots_of/,"So I have played yugi since it was released, I quit pokemon to play it. I was a scrub at pokemon and had some fairly large success at yugi. I stole only because I was poor. It was a tough period in my life that I don't think I would've changed because realistically, my friends going on to hard drugs is a lot worse than what I've accomplished. 

From stores: Your unopened boxes in those glass cases are not safe unless you lock the case before and after opening. I sat at the end of the case with my back to it, sorting cards deckbuilding etc. I could reach behind me while you helped another customer, grab an unopened box (3 in total) and stick in my backpack. Cameras might help but by the time you figure out if you sold the box or it was stolen I wouldn't be back to that store again. 

From store binders: You let me see the store binder, you have customers to help. I rest my hand on a page of cards with one in particular, flip the next page holding my hand there as a placeholder. You can't see me pull out the card out of the sleeve so that 1/4 of the card is out, and when your attention breaks in one quick motion you pull the card the rest of the way and drop it on the floor in front of you. If someone walks by, ""oh sorry you dropped this"" ""thanks guy."" If not, you found a card and keep it to yourself.

From other peoples binders: Same thing, you let my hand be a placeholder for a card I'm interested in, and usually drop it in my lap if sitting at a table, or the ground, or even just palming it and handing it off to a friend. Working in teams was way more effective. Scaringly effective. One guy ""hey I like that BLS, heres my binder"" I'm going to ask to see what you've got while you work out a deal with him, search his binder, and when you're done you lost one of your cards.

If you're playing in a large tourney, play with your bag under your feet and keep only your deckbox out on your person. Wear your backpack in front of your body. In big tournies walking in lines to see pairings, opening your backpack and grabbing a deck box happens WAY too easy. If you're sitting down to play and your backpack is on the side of your chair or even worse on the back of it, you'll lose something out of it. Binders in general can be reached into and the top 3 cards of the binder are all susceptable.

Don't let more than 1 person look at anything you have. That is just bad business. If you keep cards in a deckbox, YOU sort through them, don't let people hold them and sort through them. You'll lose cyber dragons when they're 80/per. 

Dueling: Keep your GY behind your deck. This puts loose cards closer to you, your hand is always hovering near them (to prevent others from sliding a card from the gy onto the ground where they drop something and pocket the card). Same with the extra, although I would try and keep those in a deckbox while playing. Make sure to show it or you can't use it. 

Cameras don't work. They do work in rare events but just don't get cameras and say the problem is fixed. Your judges need to be the number 1 protector against theft. Even them watching a trade happening is enough deterrent, unless you have a moron that's trying to get kicked out of the YCS before it starts.

Snatch and grabs happen. And it is so, so painful to see. I hadn't done any of this, but the handul of shonen jumps it happened. Keep the backpack in front of you and not on your back. I find a laptop back works way better because 1. it zips 2. it has snap-ins 3. you can't get past any of these without some kind of queue to it going down. Sometimes, these bags even have locks. 

Big box stores: Wallyworld/target: Blister packs are a razor blade away from being in my pocket. The bike section is where I would go to with a hand cart with some paper towels, peanut butter, etc. thrown in with some yugi packs. Easy cut and open and pocket. If it is a box, I'll open the box and put the packs in my jacket. Didn't see to many unopend boxes, the packs were sitting there easy enough. 

tl;dr: Ex-thief teaching you how to keep your shit safe. I didn't stick around long enough to see what happened, but I have stolen and have been stolen from, and it is a malicious thing that I regret whole-heartedly. Little kids are much harder to detect stealing from big stores or even your binders. If you see little hoodlums, make sure they don't keep there hand as a placeholder, keep 1 thing at a time out of your pack.",,False,self,t5_2rpe6,False,,,True,t3_1e74v2,http://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/comments/1e74v2/i_have_played_since_sdy_i_have_stolen_lots_of/,

He said to not send him more than $2 each, but who is he to tell us what to do?!  Please contact me or post below if you donate money, so I can mark you as a contributor!**

EDIT: **PhilyTheMaster will message everybody I marked down as a contributor and tell them where to send it all!**

As you may or may not know, PhilyTheMaster had a rather unfortunate encounter which ended in the theft of all his Yugioh stuff.

**Thread:** http://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/comments/1kdc3p/goodbye_ryugioh/

I originally offered to pay for a new Tempest Gusto deck for him, since that was his personal favorite, but shortly after making this offer I noticed a lot of others offering to help as well; this brought me great joy.

So I decided to start this thread to help gather all those willing to donate to the cause as well as having an aggregate list of what is still needed to complete PhilyTheMaster's Tempest Gusto deck.  In the end, I will help to cover whatever is still needed.  **I want every body to see that there is a lot of good in this community!**

If you are seriously considering contributing cards (or if you just want to wish PhilyTheMaster the best of luck), then post here or PM me what you are willing to send!  I will update the ""Still Need"" list below of what is still needed as people donate!  I will contact PhilyTheMaster about finding a way to donate to him via Paypal or however, and the best way to send him any cards!

PhilyTheMaster has done his fair share to help make this sub-reddit a better place, and I think we should help repay him!  We all know we would feel like shit if something like this happened to us.  Don't let him give up something he enjoys.

After thinking it over, I finally decided to do it. The whole process was actually very quick and simple. I just had to fill out a form online and click submit. It only took a few minutes. I felt like this had to be done and to show some amount of precedent in this community we have. Now I need your help. If you have been affected by Yugz, please fill one out in the link below. Not only will it improve the chances of him getting caught by the authorities, it will show that we do not take anything lightly that affects our community in an adverse way. If you haven't been affected personally, please don't file anything. I don't want you to get into any trouble. Any other form of help would be appreciated. If you need Yugz's information for the form, please pm me. As much as I want my $85 worth of cards back, I don't think that would be happening. But we can do something to stop something like this from happening in the future! Thanks for hearing me out.

After constructing a frog engine Obelisk deck, I was pretty damn proud of, I went to a local Lone Star Comics Tournament.  I won my first game and was ecstatic.  It was the first game I had won against someone I didn’t know.  

The next round I roll in on cloud nine, only to have my entire hand discarded by a wind up inzecktor deck.  It was humbling to say the least.  I started to feel like I had wasted so much time learning the game, and that I could never compete on that sort of level. 

After a quick 2-0 victory my former opponent complimented my deck and suggested some easy changes to make it more competitive.  After looking through my cards he gave me a Caius and a Light and Darkness Dragon, taking the time to explain how to use them.  He suggested adding Sea lancers and explained how to better use my swap frog.

That simple act kept me in the game.  I’ve won 4 out of my last 6 duels and absolutely love my deck.  

I want to thank him and all Yugioh players who are helpful to new players.  With a game this intimidating it makes a huge difference.

In the anime, Pegasus' Toon monsters cannot be attacked while they are in Toon World (when Toon World is on the field). You would attack directly instead

Ghostricks cannot be attacked while facedown with Ghostrick house on the field, which is their home. And they all set themselves facedown by effect, or ""retreat into their house"" like the Toons did. You would attack directly instead.

Toons could attack directly if the opponent did not control any face-up Toon monsters with Toon World out.

Ghostricks can attack directly with Ghostrick House out of all your opponent's monsters are facedown, which Ghostricks are good at doing.

*Edit- You cannot attack with a Toon the turn it is summoned (balance issues for direct attacking).

Ghostricks cannot be normal summoned unless you control another one

Anyone else see any similarities here? Anyone?

This is a Self-post, so please upvote for this to be seen",106,24,113,http://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/comments/11nijl/question_for_all_of_ryugioh_this_is_a_selfpost_so/,"Hey everyone of r/yugioh. I had a thought today while waiting for my class to start. What if we were able to get pro Yugioh duelist, famous yugitubers, and other notable figures of Yugioh to either do interviews, AMA's, give tips to players (old and new), etc. to help liven up the subreddit. Now I know it seems like a long shot, but I'm determined to help make this subreddit better. Not that it isn't good now, but I know there are complaints brought up time from time about how it's becoming stale. Personally, I think Gonewithlaw is a savior to this subreddit when it comes to new content, along with other's who are doing a lot for the subreddit, like slappetystick, upvotenoneofthething, link287, eatalltheballs, and CapNRoddy. I apoligize if I left others out.

This is just a start of what I had in mind, and I wanted to make this post to as YOU, what else should we try to do to make things around here more interesting? Comment below and let me know.   
  
Just in case this does get support, my first idea was to try and contact people like cyberknight8610, simplyunlucky, possibly Amanda LePalme (Dragonduelistgirl), for the yugitubers and ask them questions (which would be what all of you want asked, or get them to do AMA's). As for pro players, which may be harder to do, contact people like Billy Brake, Jeff Jones, Jarel Winston, Tyer Tabman, etc. and have them maybe do AMA's or interviews about their thoughts on the state of the game currently, what tech's they think would be good to try, what deck they think are/are going to be good. Again, this is just a vague idea off the top of my head. I'm asking you all if maybe we should try to do this, or if I shouldn't even attempt it. Anyways, let me know your thoughts. 

Update: Slim from SlimXTeamSymmetry has agreed to do an AMA, I'm discussing with him about when to do this.  
  
Update #2: bibbleskit has been awesome enough to help with one of the suggestions and started a thread pretty much about Dueling Etiquette, terms used, common mistakes, etc. http://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/comments/11o7wb/dueling_etiquette_terminology_and_habits_self/  &lt;-- The link

My friends don't like yugioh and say it is childish. The reason being that we played it as children, and they think it's not meant for teenagers and up to play. 

**THEYRE WRONG**

I really like the game and most people I know and see at locals are definitely at least a teenager up to a parent. How do I convince my friends to play with me??? Seriously, I have nobody to play with except at locals and even then I don't know anyone at my locals. What are some good torture/hostage techniques to use on my friends? 

I went to Walmart and bought some booster packs and I was strolling by the section for various ropes and I decided on a plan. I need you guys to R/F my plan to kidnap my friends, for It's in it's final stages but not quite there yet.

I picked up some gloves, a duffel bag (for the body of course), zip ties, a single chair, a hammer, various rope, a ski mask, and Bleach. I was thinking I invite them over to my house and tie them to the radiator in my basement and force them to learn the rules. If they don't cooperate, or my miss my trivia questions about XYZ monsters, I give them a little dunk in the bleach. If they try to escape, the hammer is perfect for intimidation and the ""pain factor"". In the end, they either beat me in a duel or their corpse winds up in a duffel bag in the nearest dumpster.

Hi y'all, Billy Mays here with another great guide from you. From the maker of ""[So you're too poor to afford Chaos Dragons](http://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/comments/19a8nc/chaos_agents_a_guide/) and ""[How to piss off your opponent by doing as little damage as possible but still win](http://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/comments/1dth2n/watt_control_a_comprehensive_guide/) come a great new guide ""How to loop your opponent into submission!""

Being for real now, this is going to be my guide on Tempest Gustos. This is much different than Psy-Gusto and Pure Gusto builds, so please do no take this advice for those variants. I'm [Phily, the Master](http://www.reddit.com/user/PhilyTheMaster/), and I love rogue decks. But I don't love playing them, I love WINNING with them. A lot of people on the subreddit know me for my Watts, and a few know me for Chaos Agents before that, but this was my favorite project. 

Gusto's have been known to be slow, playing cautiously and going into pretty underpowered Synchros and constantly recycling their recruiters. Basically they could ""outlast"" the opponent's attacks. But that was it, they had very little offensive prowess. But what if we change that?

What I ended up was a consistent field like:

* [this](http://imgur.com/IkG4T1Y)

* [or this](http://imgur.com/4oHx8u5)

* [and on more than one occasion, this](http://imgur.com/Ab94A1P).

How? Well, let me teach you!!

**Tempest-Gusto Guide** 

**1.0 The Monsters**

*1.1 The Gustos*

**Note** In this variant we are going to use a watered down version of the recruiter loop, because the farther away you get from Gulldo, the worse the recruiters become and the more inconsistent this whole deck becomes. I only play consistent decks. Only.

* *Gusto Gulldos*: Level 3 TUNER, 500/500 **RUN 3**

&gt; When this card is sent from the field to the Graveyard: You can Special Summon 1 Level 2 or lower ""Gusto"" monster from your Deck.

He is the main, and best, recruiter. His effect activates from any destruction, and he searches out Gusto Egul.

* *Gusto Egul*: Level 1 TUNER, 200/400 **RUN 3**

&gt; When this card is destroyed by battle and sent to the Graveyard: You can Special Summon 1 Level 4 or lower non-Tuner ""Gusto"" monster from your Deck.

The second in command, and second in the loop. He isn't quite as good as Gulldo normally, but sometimes he is even better! He searches out Winda in the normal loop, but normally will be used to search out Caam in this build

* *Winda, Priestess of Gusto*: Level 2, 1000/400 **RUN 0-2**

&gt; When this card is destroyed by battle with an opponent's attacking monster and sent to your Graveyard: You can Special Summon 1 ""Gusto"" Tuner monster from your Deck.

The crappiest of the recruiters, and seldomly used in this deck. The reason is because she has to be destroyed by your opponents monster, so creature swap-ing her and attacking over her won't trigger her effect, but would trigger Eguls. I personally only run 1, and that is only if my opponent is about to get off 3+ attacks in a row. She also restarts the loop, if you're into that.

* *Caam, $erenity of Gusto*: Level 4, 1700/1100 **RUN 3**

&gt; Once per turn: You can shuffle 2 ""Gusto"" monsters from your Graveyard into the Main Deck; draw 1 card.

Crucial as crucial can be. Recycles the recruiters, herself, and griffen. And then lets you plus. It's pretty much the heart of this deck. Never run out of Caams. Ever. Seriously, never. 

* Gusto Griffen: Level 2, 800/300 **RUN 3**

&gt; If this card is sent from the hand to the Graveyard: You can Special Summon 1 ""Gusto"" monster from your Deck. You can only use the effect of ""Gusto Griffin"" once per turn.

Released in HA07, and a total outcast compared to the other Gustos, he is actually the MVP. Pitch him and Lightning to bring out a Tempest and **ANY** Gusto you need. So amazing, and he combos like no other. Single handedly will make a dead hand unbelievably live. I'll pitch him with Tempest to grab a Debris Dragon/Lightning, and start off my recruiter loop, or SS the right level tuner to go into whatever Synchro I want. Way too good. Seriously, MVP. Oh, and he **DOESN'T MISS TIMING**. He will always be able to SS

*1.1.1* Tech Gustos.

Here is where things get very interesting. Griffen makes literally every Gusto an option. If you want to be creative, he makes it worthwhile. As a word of caution, every single gusto that isn't readily SS-able will just ruin your consistency. I'm not about that lifestyle and don't run any techs. But this is up to you.

*1.2 Tempest Core*

* Tempest, Dragon Ruler of Storms: Level 7, 2400/2200 **RUN 3**

&gt; If this card is in your hand or Graveyard: You can banish a total of 2 WIND and/or Dragon-Type monsters from your hand and/or Graveyard, except this card; Special Summon this card. During your opponent's End Phase, if this card was Special Summoned: Return it to the hand. You can discard this card and 1 WIND monster to the Graveyard; add 1 Dragon-Type monster from your Deck to your hand. If this card is banished: You can add 1 WIND Dragon-Type monster from your Deck to your hand. You can only use 1 ""Tempest, Dragon Ruler of Storms"" effect per turn, and only once that turn.

I will never never discard this card unless I absolutely have too, or I have Griffen in hand. He is the main reason this deck is so amazingly aggro. His easy summon, plus this decks easy ability to go into Black Rose Dragon means Big Eye and Mecha Phantom Beast Draccosack for days. It's almost a joke about how easy it is. Him banished (via Gold Sarc) lets you search out a Debris Dragon or Lightning, which sets up combos for days.

* Lightning, Dragon Ruler of Drafts: Level 3, 500/1800 **RUN 2-3**

&gt; You can discard this card AND 1 Dragon-Type or WIND monster; Special Summon 1 ""Tempest, Dragon Ruler of Storms"" from your Deck. It cannot attack this turn. You can only use the effect of ""Lightning, Dragon Ruler of Drafts"" once per turn.

Combo with Griffen is one of the best plays this deck can do. Easy way to set up a double Tempest turn, and then overlay into Big Eye or Mecha. Also combos with Debris Dragon for an instant Black Rose Dragon, which can be used with the Tempest you just summoned. Woah. Shit is dope.

*1.3 Other Important WIND monsters*

*  Shield Wing: Level 2, 0/900 **RUN 0-3**

&gt; Up to twice per turn, if this card would be destroyed by battle, it is not destroyed.

Amazing with this deck. Helps you survive a turn, which is sometimes all you need before the onslaught begins. Also, he combos with Tempest. Discard Tempest and Shield Wing, search out a Debris Dragon. Summon Debris Dragon, Debris Summons Shield Wing, Synchro 6 into Dragunity Knight - Gae Dearg. The combo keeps going from there, but I will explain in a bit.

* Debris Dragon: Level 4 TUNER 1000/2000 **RUN 2**

&gt; When this card is Normal Summoned: You can target 1 monster with 500 or less ATK in your Graveyard; Special Summon that target in face-up Attack Position. Its effects are negated. This card cannot be used as a Synchro Material Monster, except for the Synchro Summon of a Dragon-Type Synchro Monster. The other Synchro Material Monster(s) cannot be Level 4.

Combos with Shield Wing as described above, and with Lightning as described above. Makes your deck go above and beyond the call. Also combos with Maxx C, though not as well.

*1.4 Time to Tech it Up*

* Effect Veiler: Level 1 TUNER 0/0 **RUN 0-3**

&gt; During your opponent's Main Phase: You can send this card from your hand to the Graveyard to target 1 face-up Effect monster your opponent controls; negate that target's effects until the End Phase.

This card is amazing, and we all know why. But in this deck it has the added bonus with being a TUNER. I will use it to synchro with Mecha tokens into Armory Arm.  Just great against every meta that uses monsters.

* Maxx ""C"": Level 2 500/500 **RUN 0-3**

&gt; During either player's turn: You can send this card from your hand to the Graveyard; this turn, each time your opponent Special Summons a monster(s), immediately draw 1 card. You can only use 1 ""Maxx ""C"""" per turn.

In this swarming Meta, it's a great card to have mained. Helps plus, even harder. Plus you can discard it at any time. I've discarded it, summoned Debris Dragon, SS Maxx C and synchro'd into Iron Chain Dragon.

* Gorz the Emissary of Darkness: Level 7, 2700/2500 **RUN 0-1**

&gt; When you take damage from a card your opponent controls: You can Special Summon this card from your hand. You must control no cards to activate and to resolve this effect. When Special Summoned this way, activate the appropriate effect, based on the type of damage.

&gt; ● Battle Damage: Special Summon 1 ""Emissary of Darkness Token"" (Fairy-Type/LIGHT/Level 7/ATK ?/DEF ?). Its ATK and DEF are each equal to the amount of Battle Damage you took.

&gt; ● Effect Damage: Inflict damage to your opponent equal to the amount of damage you took.

Easy summonable Level 7, plus a nice token to synchro with. Use to your advantage, and stops OTKs!

* Tragoedia: Level 10, ?/? **RUN 0-2**

&gt; When you take Battle Damage: You can Special Summon this card from your hand. This card gains 600 ATK and DEF for each card in your hand. Once per turn: You can send 1 monster from your hand to the Graveyard to target 1 face-up monster your opponent controls with the same Level as the sent monster; take control of that target. Once per turn: You can target 1 monster in your Graveyard; this card's Level becomes the same as that target's, until the End Phase.

Combos well because his ability to change his level to whatever you need (provided it is in the graveyard). Plus discarding griffen lets you steal something that level and gets the SS from griffen!

* Droll and Lock Bird: Level 1, 0/0 **RUN 0-2**

&gt; If your opponent adds a card(s) from their Deck to their hand, except during the Draw Phase, you can send this card from your hand to the Graveyard. For the rest of this turn, neither player can add card(s) from their Deck to their hand. (Drawing cards is also considered as ""adding a card to the hand."")

Good against the meta, and a wind monster for discarding effects. Use wisely.

-------

**2.0 The Spells**

This deck is slightly reliant on a few spells, but I've won games without ever playing a spell. They aren't necessities, but are very complementary to getting combos off.

*2.1 The Staples*

* Monster Reborn **RUN 1**

&gt; Target 1 monster in either player's Graveyard; Special Summon it.

No explanation needed. This is Yugioh, and this card is *still* legal. Run it

* Heavy Storm **RUN 1**

&gt; Destroy all Spell and Trap Cards on the field.

Backrow is known as the only thing strong enough to stop Viagra from working. It kills the aggro circlejerk. It's better to be safe and draw it against FrogMonarchs game one than to be stupid and get raped by Verz because you didn't run it.

* Dark Hole **RUN 1**

&gt; Destroy all monsters on the field.

People say not to run it this Meta because a lot of decks have anti-destruction effects. Those people are idiots. You run this card. Always. Don't be a scrub.

* Mystical Space Typhoon **RUN 2-3**

&gt; Target 1 Spell/Trap Card on the field; destroy that target.

Remember, Heavy Storm, but quicker, but less effective.

*2.2 Gimme you're monster Spell cards*

* Mind Control **RUN 1**

&gt; Target 1 monster your opponent controls; until the End Phase, take control of that target, but it cannot declare an attack or be Tributed.

Good to use their monster as Synchro or XYZ bait. Good to clear a pesky monster. Good in general. Run it. Fools.

* Creature Swap: **RUN 1-3**

&gt; Each player chooses 1 monster they control and switches control of those monsters with each other. Those monsters cannot change their battle positions for the rest of this turn.

Combos with Egul amazingly, and Gulldo very well. Summon in attack position and give em away, attack over your Gusto and you get a free SS **IN THE BATTLE PHASE, SO THAT MONSTER CAN ATTACK TOO**. Doesn't work with Winda, cause she's a slut.

*2.3 Consistency Spell Cards*

* Gold Sarcophagus **RUN 2-3**

&gt; Banish 1 card from your Deck, face-up. During your second Standby Phase after this card's activation, add that card to your hand.

Banish Tempest to search out Debris or Lightning. Sometimes you might want to Banish a different card to ensure getting it. I don't know, I'm not you. Yo.

* Pot of Avarice **RUN 1**

&gt; Target 5 monsters in your Graveyard; shuffle all 5 into the Deck, then draw 2 cards.

You will literally be pumping more monsters into your graveyard than a mill deck. By the end of turn 3, half of your monsters, or more, will be in your graveyard 80% of the time, 100% of the time. This helps a lot, plus them plusses.

*2.4 Spells I don't like, but you might like*

* Contract with Gusto: **RUN 0-3, I don't care**

&gt; Target 2 ""Gusto"" monsters in your Graveyard and 1 card your opponent controls; shuffle both targets in your Graveyard to the Deck, then destroy the opponent's target.

It's good, maybe. I don't run it so I don't know.

* Emergency Teleport **RUN 0-0**

&gt; Special Summon 1 Level 3 or lower Psychic-Type monster from your hand or Deck. During the End Phase this turn, remove from play that monster.

More importantly than anything I'm about to say about this card, apparently the word Teleport is not recognized by spellcheck is automatically marked with the red-squigglys. This card is only important if you need Winda, right the fuck now. Which should be never.

---

**3.0 The Traps**

*3.1 Literally any trap you want*

This deck has a ton of versatility, and will have about 3-4 free spots by the time you're done assembling your monsters. Normally I would recommend just Royal Decree's, but with the way the meta works, it doesn't seem too worth it. Threatening Roar is my favorite trap, but cockblocks the point of the Gusto recruiter loop. So, fuck that noise.

Some Suggestions:

* Bottomless Trap Hole

&gt; When your opponent Summons a monster(s) with 1500 or more ATK: Destroy that monster(s) with 1500 or more ATK, and if you do, banish it instead of sending it to the Graveyard.

* Compulsory Evacuation Device

&gt; Target 1 monster on the field; return that target to the hand.

* Breakthrough Skill

&gt; Target 1 face-up Effect Monster your opponent controls; negate the effects of that opponent's face-up monster, until the end of this turn. During your turn, except the turn this card was sent to the Graveyard: You can banish this card from your Graveyard to target 1 face-up Effect Monster your opponent controls; negate that target's effects until the end of this turn

* Solemn Warning 

&gt; When a monster would be Summoned, OR when a Spell Card, Trap Card, or monster effect is activated that includes an effect that Special Summons a monster(s): Pay 2000 Life Points; negate the Summon or activation, and if you do, destroy that card.

* Fiendish Chain

&gt; Target 1 face-up Effect Monster on the field; that target's effects are negated, also that target cannot attack. When that target is destroyed, destroy this card. 

*3.2 Traps not to run*

* Any trap with the word Gusto in it.

---

**4.0 The extra deck**

*4.1 The Synchros*

This deck has a ton of bookkeeping to do when synchroing. Debris can only Synchro dragons, and cannot use a level 4 counterpart. Daigusto synchros need to be synchro summoned with a non-tuner Gusto monster.

*4.1.1 Level 4 Synchros*

* Armory Arm: 1800/1200 **RUN 1**

&gt; **1 Tuner + 1 or more non-Tuner monsters** Once per turn, you can either: Target 1 monster on the field; equip this card to that target, OR: Unequip this card and Special Summon it in face-up Attack Position. While equipped by this effect, that target gains 1000 ATK. When that target destroys a monster by battle and sends it to the Graveyard: Inflict damage to your opponent equal to the ATK of the destroyed monster in the Graveyard.

Good way to make a crazy strong beater with Mecha Phantom Beast Draccosack by using a token and Egul or Effect Veiler.

*4.1.2 Level 5 Synchros*

* Ally of Justice Catastor: 2200/1200 **RUN 1**

&gt; **1 Tuner + 1 or more non-Tuner monsters** At the start of the Damage Step, if this card battles a non-DARK monster: Destroy that monster immediately (without damage calculation).

The best level 5 synchro, period

* T.G. Hyper Librarian: 2400/1800 **RUN 0-1**

&gt; **1 Tuner + 1 or more non-Tuner monsters** When a monster is Synchro Summoned: Draw 1 card. This card must be face-up on the field to activate and resolve this effect.

The deck synchros a lot. If you can get him out early, great sit back and plus. If not, he is a bit dead

* Daigusto Gulldos: 2200/800 **RUN 0-1**

&gt; **1 Tuner + 1 or more non-Tuner ""Gusto"" monsters**
Once per turn: You can shuffle 2 ""Gusto"" monsters from your Graveyard into the Main Deck to target 1 face-up monster your opponent controls; destroy that target.

This is the **ONLY DAIGUSTO SYNCHRO I RUN**. Sorry, no Sphreez here, she doesn't help at all in this deck. This one is kind of good, sort of. I normally don't go into him, unless I have nothing better to do.

*4.1.3 Level 6 Synchro monsters*

* Dragunity Knight - Gae Dearg: 2400/800 **RUN 1**

&gt; **1 Dragon-Type Tuner + 1 or more non-Tuner Winged Beast-Type monsters** Once per turn, during your Main Phase, you can add 1 Level 4 or lower Dragon-Type or Winged Beast-Type monster from your Deck to your hand. Then discard 1 Dragon-Type or Winged Beast-Type monster.

He is so fucking good. For reals. You can search out a Griffen, which is all he ever is used for. Then you pitch Griffen, and SS a Gusto. OP as fuck. Seriously. I would run more but the only way to make this card is Debris Dragon and Shield Wing (or Griffen, but I have literally never ever summoned Griffen). A good combo, if you have Lightning and another Winged-Beast type in your hand is to search out Gusto Griffen, pitch the Winged-Beast, then pitch Lightning (special summoning a Tempest) and Griffen (special summoning a Gusto). Seriously too good of a card. Once he gets destroyed, he is a dragon and a wind, you can banish him for Tempest! He is too hard to make to warrant running 2 of, unfortunately.

* Iron Chain Dragon: 2500/1300 **RUN 1**

&gt; **1 Tuner + 1 or more non-Tuner monsters** You can remove from play all ""Iron Chain"" monsters from your Graveyard to have this card gain 200 ATK for each card removed, until the End Phase. When this card inflicts Battle Damage to your opponent, send the top 3 cards of your opponent's Deck to the Graveyard.

The best generic level 6, and he is also a dragon for Debris and later on for Tempest. Better than Gaia Force.

*4.1.4 Level 7 Synchros*

* Black Rose Dragon: 2400/1800 **RUN 2**

&gt; **1 Tuner + 1 or more non-Tuner monsters** When this card is Synchro Summoned, you can destroy all cards on the field. Once per turn, you can remove from play 1 Plant-Type monster from your Graveyard to change 1 Defense Position monster your opponent controls to face-up Attack Position, and reduce its ATK to 0 until the End Phase.

The best synchro in this deck. Only because he is the only good level 7 synchro. His destruction effect is great, and will often bait out a veiler, FOOLS. Instead, I use him and Tempest to XYZ into Big Eye or Draccosack all the time. I will make both Black Rose Dragons in 2 turns, cause it so easy in this deck. Debris Dragon and Lightning (which is a Debris Dragon target!), or Gulldos and Caam. It's too easy. Also a Dragon for Tempest!

*4.1.5 Level 8 Synchros*

* Stardust Dragon: 2500/2000 **RUN 1**

&gt; **1 Tuner + 1 or more non-Tuner monsters** When a Spell, Trap, Spell/Trap effect, or Effect Monster's effect is activated that destroys a card(s) on the field: You can Tribute this card; negate the activation and destroy it. During the End Phase, if this card negated an effect this way during this turn: You can Special Summon this card from your Graveyard.

Best generic level 8 Synchro monster since forever. Just good to have, just in-case. Also Dragon and Wind for Tempest.

* Crimson Bladder: 2800/2600 **RUN 1**

&gt; **1 Tuner + 1 or more Non-Tuner monsters** If this card destroys an opponent's monster by battle and sends it to the Graveyard: Your opponent cannot Normal or Special Summon Level 5 or higher monsters during their next turn.

*4.1.6 Level 9 Synchros*

* Mist Wurm: 2500/1500 **RUN 0-1**

&gt; **1 Tuner + 2 or more non-Tuner monsters** When this card is Synchro Summoned, return up to 3 cards your opponent controls to the hand

Sometimes you can make him and he is a gamesaver/winner. Sometimes you can't and he is just dead weight. Depends on how you want to play this deck.

*4.2 The XYZ*

*4.2.1 Rank 3 XYZ*

* Leviair The Sea Dragon: 1800/1600 **RUN 0-1**

&gt; **2 Level 3 monsters** Once per turn: You can detach 1 Xyz Material from this card to target 1 banished Level 4 or lower monster; Special Summon that target to your side of the field.

I have literally never made this monster, yet his sits in my extra deck because one day he will save my dick so hard. Until then, he is worthless. Wind for Tempest

*4.2.2 Rank 4 XYZ*

* Daigusto Emeral: 1800/800 **RUN 1**

&gt; **2 Level 4 monsters** Once per turn: You can detach 1 Xyz Material from this card, then activate 1 of these effects. ● Target 3 monsters in your Graveyard; shuffle all 3 into the Deck, then draw 1 card. ● Target 1 non-Effect Monster in your Graveyard; Special Summon that target.

Too good, sometimes you need the extra help to restock your deck, and the draw is pretty nice. I'll use him to restock my extra deck! Wind for Tempest

* Lightning Chidori: 1900/1600 **RUN 1**

&gt; 2 Level 4 WIND monsters
When this card is Xyz Summoned: Target 1 Set card your opponent controls; return that target to the bottom of the Deck. Once per turn: You can detach 1 Xyz Material from this card to target 1 face-up card your opponent controls; return that target to the top of the Deck.

This card is pretty amazing. Doesn't destroy, but returns. And also destroys. Nothing can be better. I use him when I can. Wind for Tempest

*4.2.3 Rank 7 XYZ*

* Number 11: Big Eye: 2600/2000 **RUN 1-2**

&gt; **2 Level 7 monsters** Once per turn: You can detach 1 Xyz Material from this card to target 1 monster your opponent controls; take control of that target. This card cannot attack the turn you activate this effect.

Too good. Seriously, there is a reason why he is 100+ bucks.

* Mecha Phantom Beast Draccosack: 2600/2200 **RUN 1-2**

&gt; **2 Level 7 monsters** Once per turn: You can detach 1 Xyz Material from this card; Special Summon 2 ""Mecha Phantom Beast Tokens"" (Machine-Type/WIND/Level 3/ATK 0/DEF 0). While you control a Token, this card cannot be destroyed by battle or card effects. Once per turn: You can Tribute 1 ""Mecha Phantom Beast"" monster, then target 1 card on the field; destroy that target. This card cannot attack during the turn you activate this effect.

This is the best card in the meta right now, for good reason. Luckily we can make it, easily. TWICE!

**5.0 How this deck runs**

This is a very combo based deck, as you should have picked up in my tips throughout the guide. You have to be a good duelist with very good vision of what you WANT to get out on the field. A turn will be 10 minutes of thinking and 5 minutes of combos. People won't like that, but you are playing one of the hardest decks out there. Every move you make opens 5-10 doors, and the next move you makes will shut all but 1-2 of those doors. You have to have good vision. This deck takes time to learn and way to long to master. I think I'm pretty good at it and I mess up all the time. Practice and practice.

There is the added benefit of being able to sit and wait. The Gustos will set up a very good barrier while the right pieces fall into your hand. You plus a gigaton and draw so much in this deck, your hand should never be empty. BUT if it is, there is the added bonus of tempest and your graveyard being live all the time. 

I love this deck so very much.

The problem that I keep seeing is that more and more people are coming here but no good rules are in place to keep content flowing as well the users here simply lurk never comment and never upvote or downvote relevant content. I am personally at my breaking point with seeing the DN screenshots with no explanation the R/F decks where the OP never comments back. A silly Jpeg sits on the front page for 2 days keeping good content out of a small thread that gets limited new content a day. I don't know what the answer is to get some of this sub moving in the right direction besides imposed rules with mods that are actually alive and active (see CapNRoddy) and the users here actually using reddiquette. I have tried to write tourney write ups as well as user guides that anybody can use but the simple fact is we have such a few amount of actual players here that r/yugioh keeps disappointing me. DN has ruined this game as well as this sub. DN has taken everything social out of this game and replaced it with a fake hollow shell of yugioh. If you want to play this game please find people and play it with real cards then report back here, instead of playing a sandbox game that allows you to do everything for free with other players that have never held a deck in their hand. until I can lurk and see improvements or some comments can shine a better light on this I will be seeing you later r/yugioh.

Please contribute what you can.

1.  When you are you attempting to get around an opponent's monster with a spell such as smashing ground, soul taker, mind control, etc. It is generally the case that you should summon and then use the spell as to avoid torrential, warning, and in some cases, bottomless trap hole. If you soul taker and then summon you've put yourself in a bad situation should they have any such traps.

2. When setting traps, do not just go ahead and set everything or just set ""whatever.""  Set based on the situation.  If you are going first and you have bottomless, dimensional prison, and warning, there's no reason for you to set the dimensional prison.  Set the bottomless, the warning, or both, and if they get around them and have a monster next turn you can set the prison and take care of it.  If you, for instance, set the warning and the prison and they heavy and summon a thunder king, your bottomless is, for the time being, a dead card.  You foolishly lost your out to thunder king.

3. Be smart with your MST.  Use it when you need it.  If your opponent has two face-downs and you are merely going to set this turn, just set the monster and the MST.  If they MST at end phase, you've gone even.  If they don't, you're now either going to have the MST when you need it or plus when they use their MST.  If your opponent has two face-downs and you have an MST and, say, a Thunder King and no other monsters, just be considerate of your deck and the rest of your cards in hand.  I would personally avoid the blind MST and summon the Thunder King or set the MST along with a defensive trap until the game state has been simplified or I draw more monsters should my opponent have a warning, bottomless, etc.

4. When building a side deck : Always know what you are going to be siding out when you decide to put cards in your side deck.  If you are siding heavy for Dark World and Mermail and you side 3 Soul Drain, 3 D Fissure, and 3 Macro, that's fine.  But when you get to game two and realize you only have 6 cards you can afford to side out, you now have 3 dead cards in your side deck.  

I may update this for some particularly good ones. Please add on or feel free to ask questions about any particular game situations.   I hope this is helpful.

May 15th, 2013

This past weekend, the YCS in Meadowlands, New Jersey introduced Hidden Arsenal 7: Knight of Stars to the major competitive Dueling landscape. As is always the case with new cards, new questions and new situations arose, and as always, our incredible volunteer Judges rose to the challenge and performed admirably.

As is the case in any game or sport where officiating exists, which is basically all of them, players and officials can and will disagree on the rules and their interpretations. In this game, we welcome such disagreements as they promote discussion and help us understand the different ways our players and judges view the game, the cards, the card text, and the rules in general.

All information gathered is carefully examined and processed so that we can improve the way our cards are written and create the best gameplay experience possible for all Duelists. It normally takes a while before you see any changes based on such information, but an interesting situation arose this past weekend in New Jersey that we feel a need to address right away, as it’s likely to affect this weekend’s National Championships around the world.

The core disagreement this past weekend was on the mechanics of Evilswarm Castor and Constellar Pollux, monsters that provide extra Normal Summons for their respective themes. They read as follows:

During the turn this card was Normal Summoned, you can Normal Summon 1 “lswarm/Constellar” monster in addition to your Normal Summon/Set. (You can only gain this effect once per turn.)

As you can see, these effects don’t start a Chain. You can tell because they have no colon or semi-colon anywhere to be seen. What you might not know, is that this text isn’t new. It’s been used before back in 2011 on Dverg of the Nordic Alfar, who says this:

During the turn this card is Normal Summoned, you can Normal Summon 1 “Nordic” monster in addition to your Normal Summon/Set. (You can only gain this effect once per turn.)

Identical, apart from the past tense verb in Castor and Pollux. Castor and Pollux were written this way because the cards are supposed to work the exact same way. And that’s where the big disagreement stemmed from this past weekend. At the YCS, Castor and Pollux were ruled to be Continuous Effects. That makes them work just like Dverg of the Nordic Alfar, and follow all the same rules as Dverg of the Nordic Alfar, as posted on the official website. That meant that you could negate the effect with Effect Veiler or Skill Drain, and if Dverg/Castor/Pollux aren’t on the field, you can’t use the extra Summon. This was obviously the correct ruling to make, considering the identical text of the cards, knowledge of Problem-Solving Card Text, and the published Storm of Ragnarok rulebook.

Players disagreed. Most strongly in fact. In the past 72 hours, “How do Evilswarm Castor and Constellar Pollux work?” has been the most asked question at us-ygorules@konami.com by far. It eclipses the usual most asked question “Can Number monsters be destroyed in battle by non-Number monsters?”* by almost 2000%. The players say that Castor and Pollux should work like the extraordinarily similarly worded Dodger Dragon from Extreme Victory, which has rulings in the Extreme Victory rulebook that say it works the exact opposite way of Dverg. Namely, that once it’s Normal Summoned successfully, unless Skill Drain was already face-up on the field when it was Summoned, your opponent can’t play Counter Traps for the rest of the turn, no matter what they do to Dodger Dragon. Dodger Dragon says:

“Your opponent cannot activate Counter Trap Cards the turn this card is Normal Summoned.“

Aside from the order in which the phrases are placed, this card is identical to Dverg, Castor, and Pollux. But it has rulings that say it works completely differently than those cards. What we end up with is a situation where the judges were right, but the players have a valid and very pressing point. It’s everything that we wanted to avoid when we introduced Problem-Solving Card Text.

So we’re going to clear this up once and for all. They’re rather unique effects, as there are only 5 cards in all of Dueling that work like this. They are, Dverg of the Nordic Alfar, Constellar Pollux, Evilswarm Castor, Dodger Dragon, and Blizzard Princess. And the way they are meant to work is this:

-If you Normal Summon them successfully, and their effects are not negated from the moment they step on to the field by something like Skill Drain, then for the rest of the turn their effect is applied, regardless of what happens to the monster.

Because of the unique nature of these cards, we’re still working on the best way to present their text to show that this is an effect, and there is a way to negate it, but that they are not a Continuous effect like Atlantean Heavy Infantry that can be negated at any time. We do welcome suggestions on what each of you, personally, think would be the best way to word such effects. You can send your thoughts on that to us-ygorules@konami.com. Regardless, if you’re getting ready for your National Championships or other major events this weekend, keep in mind that all of these cards will now be ruled the same way, as stated above.

One more thing before I go, however. Some of you may be asking “Well what about Photon Cerberus? Isn’t it the same?” It’s not. Photon Cerberus is pretty special, but it was much easier to write it because it works like a standard Continuous Effect, it’s just a Continuous Effect that is only active for one turn – the turn it’s Normal Summoned. To indicate that it works this way, we actually used a holdover from the old way that Continuous Effects were written, to make absolutely sure that it’s read and interpreted correctly. Here’s its text from its upcoming Number Hunters re-release:

During the turn this card was Normal Summoned, neither player can activate Trap Cards while this card is face-up on the field.

That’s the same “while this card is face-up on the field” we used back in Extreme Victory to let you know that Karakuri Komachi mdl 224 “Ninishi” was a Continuous Effect that can be negated.

And so the strange tale of Castor, Pollux, Dverg, and Dodger comes to an end. A big thank you to our judges at the YCS for a job well done, and another big thank you to all our players for your continued passion and love for the game. I hope you all enjoy your events this weekend, and remember: it’s always time to Duel!

1368163201.0,69,self.yugioh,1e1x5b,A new level of broken.,98,29,94,http://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/comments/1e1x5b/a_new_level_of_broken/,"RANTPOST however I'm bringing at least some new points to the table.

Looking through OCG tournament results of late has rekindled my deep, deep discontent with Konami and YGO in general. Recent top 8's include:

1 Evilswarms, 7 Degenerate dragons (Verz won)

8 Degenerate dragons

2 Prophecy, 6 Degenerate dragons (Dragons won)

1 Prophecy, 7 Degenerate dragons (Dragons won)

8 Degenerate dragons

you get the picture. Honestly, I was shocked. What's even more horrifying is that just 30% on average of players are running E-Drags in these tournaments, yet absolutely dominate the top 8. I mean, TeleDaD did this too, but everyone ran that. The unbelievable overrepresentation of this deck in the top rankings is just sickening.

That's not all: When you take into account that they have broken archetypes that we in the TCG haven't even glimpsed at yet, the fact that they've had Krekyon since the beginning, the fact that people are MAINING triple droll+lock, and the deck isn't even slowed down, you've just gotta look at Konami. How delusional are they? How are they letting this happen? How are they releasing articles about Dragossack without mentioning E-Drags at all? Protip guys: If you make an archetypes boss monster available with any two level 7's, you better make damn sure that you didn't JUST RELEASE A SET OF CARDS IN THE SAME SET that make the monster ten times more effectively and consistently. Why do beastcrafts even exist? In their dragossack article they talk about ways to summon the damn thing - their optimal method requires 3 specific cards and sitting through an opponents turn with a face up trap and some nothing monsters while they supposedly do nothing. 

To put into perspective how broken this deck is - think about how expensive prophecy is, think about how we watched as they released broken spellbook after broken spellbook, and then think that it's doing NOTHING compared to the dragons. Drop in the ocean. Nada. This deck is so broken that between it and prophecy it has literally made one of the three types of card in this game (traps) completely obsolete. The game mechanic of required setting literally makes them too slow. Everything is too slow for this deck, it forgoes Tragoedia for christ's sake. 

Coming from a guy who could actually build this deck if I wanted to - I say screw you Konami and screw you degenerate dragons. I'll be maining my Debunks and mind drains until September hopefully puts a stopper on this shitstorm. I'll lose, a lot, but I don't care. I refuse to stoop down to this level of broken.",,False,self,t5_2rpe6,False,,earth,True,t3_1e1x5b,http://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/comments/1e1x5b/a_new_level_of_broken/,

I'd like to welcome you to an introductory post for an event started by /u/Arcanitemagician. In this post, and subsequent series we will be discussing various decks. However, what I want to cover with you is something a little bit different. You see, many people know about different decks. What cards they should run, the ratios etc, but I want to focus on something slightly unrelated to this. I want to talk about deck theory and the general underlying concepts that go into deck building. Rather than bore you with all the little details though I'll just jump right in.

---

**Engines**

The first deck concept that is important to look at is one that often is also the most difficult to build around. That is the Engine. Now what exactly is an engine? Engines are the driving factor of the deck. They provide the means of creating a desired output. Some engines are extremely compact while others can take the entire deck to really function properly and consistently. Sometimes engines are referred to as Deck Cores, but I would say that engines are more specific than deck cores. 

Now from here I want to talk about three main points in regards to engines. The first is simply resources. What is a resource in a given deck? Well, that question is a little bit hard to answer immediately. Rather, there are six potential sources of resources that a deck can use. The first one most people think of is the graveyard. 
*Why?* Well, most decks in the game of Yugioh tend to rely pretty heavily on the graveyard. Decks will regularly recycle resources in the grave, or use the resources that are there to make a play on the field. The next place where resources are usually gathered from is the field. XYZ's and Synchro monsters are one of the first places that we go to get the resources needed for their summon. However, the field is also where our ability to attack, trigger certain core effects or true resource denial begins. I'll cover this later. Now, there's three other resource sources that I want to cover with you. These are, the banished zone, deck, extra deck and hand. Of these, I would say that the most important one is actually your hand. Your hand, and the cards in it, are usually going to be the sole limiting factor in your ability to make plays. The first five cards you draw will inevitably define your deck's strategy for the game ahead and your responses. It's also the place where you will first start consuming resources in this game. Your plays begin in your hand. Consumption of cards in the hand can lead to top decking or burning through resources in a way that may not be healthy for your specific deck. More on that later With your deck that's another story entirely. One that can often times be the determinant of victory or defeat. Your deck is the largest resource available. It's also the one that's usually the hardest to tap into with most decks that can having massive amount of tutoring potential built in. Decks that can consistently pull from their deck increase consistency while at the same time thinning the deck. This is why many current meta decks are so powerful. The other two resources the extra deck and banished zone are somewhat hit or miss. The banished zone has very few cards that can really take advantage of the monsters there. The ones that do exist and do take power from the banished zone usually rely on having a large number of banished monsters. Not necessarily a bad thing, but in terms of resource consumption it isn't the greatest path to choose in my personal opinion. The last source is the extra deck. There are a finite number of resources in the extra deck. For some decks the extra deck is simply an out. It provides the tool the deck needs to win. For others it's the core of the deck design.

---
**Resource Consumption**


That's a brief overview of the resource sources in the game of Yugioh. Now I want to talk about their consumption. Different decks will inevitably interact with their resources differently. Rather than going into excruciating detail about this process I want to instead focus on the details involved with actually consumption. Most decks require more resources be used to perform an action than you would necessarily gain from that action. That said, there are decks that can easily produce massive gain by simply making the right play at the right time. This is a judgment call for most players. Sometimes referred to as doing the math. However, what I want to focus on is something somewhat different from this concept. 
When a deck consumes a resource most of the time it's one and done. It's very difficult to regularly reuse a spent resource which is part of the reason why certain decks must set their graveyards heavily before starting a major play. Once the process begins it will burn fuel so quickly that once it's spent the match either must be won, or you've lost. 

Now what does this have to do with deck building? Well, in general the idea of deck construction is to have a goal and complete it. Your resources are your fuel and your engine will run on those resources. Much like a car, once you're out of gas you either have to fill it up or stall out. Then there's the distinct possibility someone will slash your tires. Yugioh isn't a game of solitaire. In fact it was built on the principle of trying to make a play while your opponent is trying to interrupt your play. Resource denial is a major way for players to win in the game of yugioh. In fact, it shaped the meta for a long time. To a limited degree, depending on where you're looking it still shapes the meta now. Interruption of a deck or engine is one of the quickest ways to insure victory. Waiting for your opponent to try for a key play and interrupting it by destroying, bouncing or neutralizing the core card for the play is pretty huge. Equally as powerful is simply preventing searches, limiting draw power or a number of other options. So much so that it actually has it's own deck type based on this principle.

---
**Deck types, who is your daddy and what does he do?**

A deck type is really a meta classification of a deck. There are three deck types. These form a triangle of sorts  and I will explain that in a minute. 

The first major deck type is an aggro deck. Much like it sounds, it's going to be an aggressive deck. They're fast and usually rely on filling the field with powerful monsters very early in the game. The general philosophy of an aggro deck is, “If I can run you over before you can respond. I win.” Most deck in Yugioh have some kind of One Turn Kill set up. However, some decks, the OTK is the first and only thing they really care about. They focus so heavily on putting overwhelming firepower on the board that that's all that matters to the deck itself. 

Next on the list is Stun. Stun decks are pretty much the exact opposite of Aggro. An aggro deck want's to run you over. A Stun deck wants to make you burn and waste resources until there's nothing left while slowly whittling you down. Shortly after you've consumed all your resources it'll turn around and kick you in the teeth.

The last deck type in Yugioh is a Combo deck. Combo decks are pretty simple in conception. They want to create a loop of some sort that will inevitably deny your opponent resources or win the game. Sounds simple right? Well, most combo decks are actually pretty clunky requiring multiple pieces or parts to actually kick things off fully. It's difficult of course to actually create the situation where the combo can go off all the time. This is why combo decks that are purely combo seldom see play at high levels. 

Now, with the definitions drawn out I'm going to tell you a little secret. Most decks in Yugioh are going to be a mixture of these combinations. In fact, every single deck will likely have some aspects of these characteristics built into them. However, it seldom works out as cleanly or clearly as being pure meddles either.  So why bring it up? Well, to give you an idea of what you're building versus what is being built. If you're going to design a deck you have to take into consideration not only what you're playing but what you might interact with. A robust design versus a weak design require different approaches and different support structures in the deck itself.

---
**Deck Internal Synergy**

Now I've talk a lot about broad topics in the idea of deck design. Now I want to talk about why your harpie-machima-vanilla-knight deck isn't working. 

In this section I want to talk about consistency, the ability of your deck to do what you want it to do. You see, consistency comes from a number of factors. Luck, card choice and card count matter. Now in this section what I want to tell you about is simple. How to improve your consistency. Most decks in Yugioh have an end goal. They want to do something on the field. Whether that means flooding it with monsters, or drawing exodia, they still need certain options or characteristics to actually make it happen. So how do I make sure that I have those options?

Propagation of a particularly poor packaging practice has prompted me to pen this passionate picture essay.

It is important to size your container to match your package. Any leftover space must be filled. This applies to packages large and small, including those in envelopes, which I will address here. If care is not taken, you may end up with something like [this](http://i.imgur.com/niIuDw7.jpg).

Sleeves and a toploader provide basically all the protection cards need. **In most cases they are only vulnerable to damage or being lost if the envelope tears.** Since the toploader provides rigidity, the closer the size of the envelope to the toploader, the safer the cards will be. **Do not send cards in large envelopes that are more prone to tear. Use small security envelopes.** They are extremely inexpensive and also conceal cash and checks. [Left good, right bad.](http://i.imgur.com/K1WUggO.jpg)

We're not safe yet! There's another bad habit. Tightly wrapping the toploader in a [shell of paper](http://i.imgur.com/rZ5PZra.jpg) only increases the chance of tearing. We don't need paper to protect the cards, we need paper to protect the envelope. **Wrap the toploader in 1-2 sheets of paper (depending on the thickness) [such that it fills the envelope](http://i.imgur.com/i9Oxgqp.jpg)**. This will provide enough rigidity so that it won't flop all over the place and tear. Friction will prevent excessive movement.

Last but not least, it's a good idea to [reinforce with tape](http://i.imgur.com/UOHjYIB.jpg).

Please take care to package cards correctly. They may not be yours anymore, but they will be your problem if they don't arrive safely!

ONE MORE THING...[rant] About extra cards. Everyone started throwing in extra cards, but it's a thinly-veiled attempt to get the icon on the feedback page and dump commons. If you want to be generous and give extra cards, please send something useful. I have enough useless commons of my own to deal with, I don't need yours. Nobody likes junk mail.

1376714392.0,69,self.yugioh,1kj8z7,A Guide To Your First Locals! AKA How to make friends and not get ripped off,79,10,45,http://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/comments/1kj8z7/a_guide_to_your_first_locals_aka_how_to_make/,"I. Before You Arrive

A. Shower and perform basic hygiene rituals. Seriously guys just because it's a bunch of people who like Yugioh (and magic) doesn't mean we can't smell you. Even from across the table!

B. Grab all the things you'll be needing. Deck, playmat (not required), extra sleeves if you plan to trade, a trade binder, dice for rolling first go and placing counters on cards, a laptop or phone to look up trade values on the fly, pen and paper for note keeping,  and an attitude that encourages making friends and winning some booster packs.

C. Take a few minutes to gather yourself and make sure you're not forgetting anything, because trust me a good trade might slip away if you're asking someone to wait an entire week.

II. Your Trade Binder

a. Generally you'll just want to have all the holo cards you own and any semi to valuable commons that people generally like to have. EX: Maxx ""C"", Veliers, Battle Faders etc etc

b. Know your values! Seriously the best way to get ripped off is to not know your values. Do NOT feel pressured to make a trade without looking at the lowest BIN on ebay. From there you can make deals but NEVER EVER EVER let someone bully you into trading you down. Always stick to your values, they're are plenty of honest people willing to trade you cards

c. Even if you think your holos are junk, someone out there is looking for them so just bring them even if it's just binder filler.

d. Card selling: Generally banned inside the store, but if you choose to do so. Do it either outside or be sure no one is watching. I do not encourage this behavior but some of you do it anyway so I might as well include it.

III. Arrival and Set-up!

a. Try to arrive somewhere between 30 minutes to an hour early. Normally upon arrival you'll just have to register and pay your entrance fee if you choose to participate in the tournament (Hint: it's a lot of fun and should be the biggest reason your're coming!) After you register you'll normally just go find yourself a seat at the tables and chairs while other people start showing up. Chat up your fellow duelists! Most of them are just cool people who share at least one common interest with you, it's almost guaranteed you'll have more in common than just yugioh.

b. Feel free to ask people about their trade stuff, generally EVERYONE will have a binder. Big and small, really valuable or nearly worthless. No need to make a big scene about someone's binder though, it's kinda lame really. If the binder is full of junk, just politely browse through it and say ""Sorry, I didn't see anything right now"" 

c. ALWAYS ASK BEFORE YOU REMOVE CARDS FROM SOMEONE ELSES BINDER. Seriously that's shit is very touchy for some people especially if their cards are really valuable.

d. Generally the way trading works is you find things you want in each other's binders and then go about evening out the trade value until both of you are satisfied with the outcome. Like I said earlier always know your values and never let someone round your values down. EX: Card worth $1.50, don't let them tell you it's only worth a dollar. 

e. Write down the card names you're trading and put the agreed upon values beside them to make absolutely sure that you're not getting too much minus from the trade. If you feel uncomfortable with the trade or the person you're trading with you have ZERO obligation to continue talking to them, just disengage from the whole situation.

IV. The Tournament

a. Generally around 30 minutes are the top of the hour the store owner or judge will announce the first rounds. This means you'll be sent to a table with another person with the intention of politely KICKING THEIR ASS.

b. Feel free to introduce yourself, and at some point you'll both need to shuffle and cut each other decks and roll a dice or some other game of chance to determine who goes first. My locals leaves it up to the players.

c. From here on you'll be playing a game of yugioh which you should have plenty of experience doing or maybe you're brand new.

d. Always always always feel free to ask questions about cards and effects that are being played. Never be afraid to ask why something happened especially if your opponent doesn't announce their plays. You can also ask how many cards your opponent has in their hand, and if you ever feel like you're being cheated call a judge just to be sure especially if your opponent is a yugi-jerkhole. The match is a best 2 out of 3.

e. Siding is when you take your side deck (1-15 Cards) and swap cards from it into your main deck. Adding and subtracting cards as you see fit. EX: Taking out two MSTs and adding in two Compulses if fine so long as you have legal cards and at least 40 in your main. Swapping out your extra deck is also permissible, which could be helpful for E-Heroes and other decks. General rule of thumb: side in whatever you think your opponent will hate the most. For xyz and synchro decks that means Compulsory Evacuation Device, etc etc

e. Once a game has finished, if you lost always be the first one to offer a hand shake, it symbolizes the fact that you aren't a sore loser. Even if you have a horrible loss, you should try to swallow your pride and shake hands because after all it's just a children's card game. (This rule is null and void if your opponent is an ass)

f. After the duel you'll both announce the results to the owner/judge. Some locals make you write the results down and both sign it. Either way, don't lie it's a good way to get DQ'd or thrown out.

g. After your game you'll normally have a little time between matches to talk and such with your fellow duelist. Feel free to trade and browse the store. Maybe buy some packs to support the store. DO NOT CHANGE YOUR DECK, that's against the rules and will get your DQ'd. You have to use the deck your showed up with, and remember if you sided to unside your deck after the game. The judges will tell you where to go until the tournament is over.

V. After the tournament

a. The owner/judge will normally announce the winner and prizes. The prizes are normally booster packs relative to the number of entries. My store doesn't let you choose, your mileage may vary

b. From here on it's whatever you feel like doing. Duel your buds, or trade or talk about the current meta or whatever floats your boat.

c. Feel free to leave at any point, or exchange numbers with some peeps there if you feel like they could be good friends outside of the yugioh world. I've made a couple really good friends this way, hell if you're lucky there might even be females there!

d. Use your post game knowledge to tweak your deck for next time! Go home and tweak tweak tweak, and feel free to write a locals report for your good ol' buddies at /r/yuigoh! 

This turned out a little longer than I thought but I really hope this encourages some people to go to their first locals and get out into the world!

Please please pleeeeeeeeease give me some feedback on this guide, I literally just sat down and wrote it from the top of my head and personal experience.

Quick trade edit: don't be afraid to offer people deals, you don't HAVE to stick hard to eBay values but you have every right to. But like I said just use your best judgement about values and such but never feed the sharks or you'll end up with an empty binder ",,False,self,t5_2rpe6,1376715882.0,,dark,True,t3_1kj8z7,http://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/comments/1kj8z7/a_guide_to_your_first_locals_aka_how_to_make/,

**TCG (Trading Card Game / Non-japanese Card; USA, EU, etc)**

Top Decks:

* **Mermails**: The star of this format, fast, aggresive, and consistent. Have the infamous [Megalo-Diva OTK](http://youtu.be/tMXv_eQeq_g) which can kill you *often* in turn 2. Can be built with Genex Undines and Genex Controllers, or not, which usually called as [Mono Mermails](http://articles.alterealitygames.com/?p=19299). **Common side deck counters:** Soul Drain, Debunk, Macro Cosmos, Mind Crush, Dust Tornado. [A sample deck](http://yugioh.tcgplayer.com/db/deck.asp?deck_id=95154).

* **Brotherhood of Firefist/Brofist**: Awesome newcomer archetype debuted in Cosmo Blazer. Packed with constant 1-for-1 destruction and constant supply of +1 with Bear. A very consistent and versatile deck which more than capable to grind you to death. **Common side deck counters:** Overworked, Xing Zhen Hu, Dust Tornado. [A sample deck](http://yugioh.tcgplayer.com/db/deck.asp?deck_id=95437); [further reading](http://articles.alterealitygames.com/?p=21588).

* **Dino-Rabbit**: Using rescue rabbit to summon 2 vanilla (Normal Monster) dinosaurs to XYZ summon **Evolzar Laggia** or **Evolzar Dolkka** which both have game-defining effects, while packed with shitload of traps. Infamous for first turn laggia backed with 5 backrows. **Common side deck counters:** Gozen Match, Snowman Eater, Soul Taker. [A sample deck](http://yugioh.tcgplayer.com/db/deck.asp?deck_id=95168).

* **Dino-Fist**: By adding three Sabersauruses in a Fire Fist deck, you have a chance to open with the dreadful turn 1 laggia, while Sabersaurus itself have respectable 1900 ATK. Since both the core of those deck is quite similar, it worked well. This deck have a good chance against Mermails since it can make early **Evolzar Dolkka**, which practically shuts their effects twice. **Common side deck counters:** Royal Decree, Dust Tornado, Soul Taker. [A sample deck](http://articles.alterealitygames.com/?p=21383).

* **Wind-Up**: The star of the last format. Super fast swarming and the infamous of Wind-up Magician + Shark combo into a Shock-Lock. Have been weakened severely with the limiting of Magician and the banning of Zenmainty; but still deadly enough, though way less consistent. **Common side deck counters:** Gozen Match, Needle Ceiling, Maxx ""C"". [A sample deck](http://yugioh.tcgplayer.com/db/deck.asp?deck_id=95443).

**OCG (Original Card Game – Japanese cards, which usually 1-2 sets faster than TCG)**

Top Decks:

* **Elemental/Incarnate Dragons**: Crazy dragons from the Lord of The Tachyon Galaxy Set. There are 4 elemental dragons, each of them have 4 different and very usable effect, one of them which making a search if banished, and it can't miss the timing. Super versatile, and surprisingly, these dragon can be splahsed on most dragon decks, or most decks which run their respective elements. Infamous for their Big Eye plays, and OTK with Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon or Return From The Different Dimension. **Common side deck counters:** Debunk, Imperial Iron Wall, Electric Virus. 
This archetype is huge, and quite complex to explain, probably you'll be better off by reading [this Jeff Jones' article](http://articles.alterealitygames.com/?p=21182), or [this Amanda's article](http://blog.coretcg.com/dragons-incarnated-the-new-dragons-of-tachyon-galaxy/). They were great reads.


* **Prophecy with Judgment Day**: [**Spellbook Judgment Day**](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Spellbook_Judgment_Day), one of the most infamous single card on the net these past few weeks. This card can generate a free +5 in one turn, thus give this deck an almost unfair card advantage. Very powerful search capabilities, very easy to summon their boss monster, **High Priestess of Prophecy** (which now happened to be [one of the most expensive cards on the competitive scene](http://yugioh.tcgplayer.com/db/yugioh_single_card.asp?cn=High+Priestess+of+Prophecy&amp;sn=Return+of+the+Duelist&amp;rarity=Secret+Rare)) with shitload of support cards like **Spellbook of Power**, **Spellbook of Wisdom**, **Spellbook of Life**, and **Spellbook of Fate** for removal. **Common side deck counters:** Droll and Lock Bird, Eradicator Epidemic Virus.


* **Evilswarm/Verz**: The star of the previous format in Japan, and still going very strong. The deck's primary strength lies in their exclusive Rank 4 XYZ monster, [**Evilswarm Ophion**](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Evilswarm_Ophion) which prevent their opponent to summon monsters above level 5 and shut down most of competitive decks. Not only that, this deck is packed with ton of ways to protect their Ophion, including the searchable Forbidden lance, **Infestation Pandemic**. It's not rare to see the Ophion in turn 1, since Evilswarms make XYZs very fast and effortless, thanks to their Rescue rabbit engine coupled with their monsters' effect, such as: **Evilswarm Kerkyion**, **Evilswarm Castor**, and **Evilswarm Thunderbird**. They even have a searchable trap card to return their drawn vanilla to deck: **Infestation Infection**, which renders their first Rescue rabbit *always* live. **Common side deck counters:** Penguin soldier, Neo Spacian Grand Mole, Injection Fairy Lily, Rivalry of Warlords, Consecrated Light.


* **Firefist 3-Stars**: Different than the 1-for-1 playstyle in the TCG build, this build focused on level 3 Firefists, especially abusing [**Chicken**](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Brotherhood_of_the_Fire_Fist_-_Chicken)'s effect, and using **Spirit** and [**Horse Prince**](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Brotherhood_of_the_Fire_Fist_-_Horse_Prince) to swarm the field with big beaters and synchros. They could summon [**Beast God Vulcan**](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Beastlord_Volcan) easily to recycle continous S/T cards while gaining a plus when returning an extra deck monster. [**Sirius The Blue Dog Star**](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Sirius_the_Blue_Dog_Star) is also a great pick since it's a cheap easy tribute for **Eradicator Epidemic Virus** when you have at least one face up Fire Formation S/T on the field -- which practically almost always.**Common side deck counters:** Overworked, Xing Zhen Hu (not really familliar with this matchup too).

The Guide to the Bone Tower Mill.",82,17,56,http://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/comments/1h1i52/and_after_these_summons_mill_40_gg_the_guide_to/,"A lot of friends ask me why I play such a strange deck. The Bone Tower mill is hardly something you see every day. I have never played against another Bone Tower Mill, which is great because it's pretty unexpected, so you have BOOM, element of surprise. There is no Archetype in this deck. It's a collection of Zombie Monsters that allow you to spam monsters and reuse them as many times as possible in as short amount of time. 

If you're good, you can get 8-12 summons in a turn, which is a max of 48 mills.

**STAPLE MONSTERS.**

**Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower**

The Titular Monster of this deck. The Tower cannot be attacked while there is another zombie face up on your side of the field. Every time a Zombie is Special Summoned (including by your opponent), your opponent mills 2 cards. Multiple towers stack, so having two towers makes 4 mills per summon, and 3 makes 6. I recommend having 2 on the field at all times. RUN THREE.

**Pyramid Turtle**

Pyramid Turtle is the single most important (non-titular of course) monster in this deck. When he is destroyed by combat, you can special summon one Zombie of 2000 defense or less. Ignoring monsters with special summon requirements (such as Vampire Genesis) there are only 4 Zombies NOT summonable by this card. A common strategy is to summon a turtle, suicide him into an opponents monster, to summon another turtle. Rinse and repeat for an easy 6-18 mills. RUN THREE.

**Plaguespreader Zombie**

Plaguespreader Zombie or Pain Painter are required for all zombie synchros. Its ability allows it to special summon itself from the graveyard, and be banished when it leaves the field. This is for the ""cost"" of putting one card from your hand on top of your deck. Plaguespreader is an easy 1 mill from his synchro. Another 1 for his ability. That's 8 cards off your opponent. Restricted. Run one.

**Mezuki**

Mezuki is a staple for any zombie player. If he's in your Graveyard, you can banish him to summon any zombie from your graveyard. Useful to cycle Pyramid Turtle or Plaguespreader Zombie. Restricted. Run one.

**Spirit Reaper**

Spirit Reaper is a common enough card. It cannot be destroyed by combat. If affected by a spell, trap, or effect (not targeted, affected), it is instantly destroyed. Combine with Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower for a hard wall to break through. I run two, but one would suffice.

**Zombie Master**

Zombie Master is a great card for this deck. Discard one card from your hand to summon one level four or lower Zombie from either player's Graveyard. This includes the card you discard. Combine with Plaguespreader Zombie for an easy two summons (one plaguespreader, one synchro). RUN THREE.


**SPELLS**

**Book of Life**

Summon one Zombie from your Graveyard, banish any monster from your opponent's. This is a great card for reusing turtles and Plaguespreader, but if your opponent's monster in the graveyard cannot be banished (or if there is no monster to banish), this card cannot be used. If your opponent throws out Imperial Iron Wall, destroy it, or this card is just a dead draw. RUN THREE.

**Zombie World**

The Zombie Field Card. Every monster on the field, and in both graveyards, are now Zombies. This allows you to steal from your opponent with the likes of Zombie Master, but there are some other great effects that some people forget about. Every monster your opponent special summons from now on is a Zombie, and as such, causes a mill if you have a Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower on the field. It's also particularly nasty to players who rely on a monster type, rather than an archetype. Want to use that Spellbook? Nope. You don't have any Spellcasters, only Zombies. Also, opponents cannot even resort to tribute Normal Summons, because you can only tribute summon Zombies. RUN THREE.

**Inferno Reckless Summon**

Milling Cruelty Incarnate. Any monster with 1500 attack or less (Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower and Pyramid Turtle spring straight to mind), that is Special Summoned to your side of the field, you can summon all copies from deck, graveyard, and hand, as well as your opponent. If Zombie World is on the field, your opponent also just special summoned Zombies, so they mill more. RUN THREE.

**Pot of Avarice**
Put more monsters back into your deck for your Turtles, then draw cards. It's a good card.
Restricted. Run one.

**TRAPS**

**Call of the Haunted**

Your opponent has eliminated all of your monsters, leaving your Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower wide open. You summon a Pyramid Turtle, or Bone Tower from your Graveyard. Great for tricking your opponent. RUN THREE.

**Strategy**
The goal of the deck is to get a tower out as quickly as possible, then spam Zombie Special Summons. First hand contains a Turtle or a Tower? You're set. If it contains a Spirit Reaper and a Tower? You've got a very strong starting hand.

This deck has the capability for a very easy win. Two turns if you're lucky and your opponent plays along.

With one tower on the field, activate an inferno reckless summon to pull out all your turtles. Have them suicide into your opponents monster. Have the first one pull another Tower. Second Mezuki, Third Plaguespreader. Synchro Plaguespreader and Mezuki together, then use Mezuki's effect to summon another monster. That's a lot of mills. If your opponent is running a large deck, summon Plaguespreader, or another Turtle again.

If you're doing it right, you will never need to attack (except with Suicide Turtles). Try to reserve your Graveyard summon cards (Call of the Haunted, Monster Reborn, Book of Life), for monsters that include a second, easy, Special Summon, like Pyramid Turtle or Plaguespreader. Two mills for the price of one. Only Inferno Reckless on your Turtles or your Towers. It's a very quick and easy way to get quick mills, and all three of your Spirit Reapers mean next to nothing.

**Other Useful Cards**

**Goblin Zombie**

I don't run this card personally. When it is destroyed by combat it allows you to take one zombie with 1200 def or less from your deck and put it in your hand. It's okay, but when you're cycling Pyramid Turtle, you're pulling from the deck anyway.

**Terraforming**

Search for your Zombie World. Punish your opponent quicker for special summoning their monsters.

**Call of the Mummy**

Great for an opening hand, or recovering from a Dark Hole. Otherwise, a bit of a dead draw. I only run one. Most Zombie Players I know don't even use it.

**Pain Painter**

A substitute for Plaguespreader. It counts as Plaguespreader for the purposes of synchro summons. It's effect allows you to treat two Zombies on your side of the field as L2. This is great for summoning Archfiend Zombie Skull (see Extra Deck).

**Pyramid of Wonders**

An underappreciated card in my opinion. For every monster your opponent controls all your zombies gain 200 atk. Which is nice, but not the main draw here. If one face up zombie would be destroyed, destroy the pyramid instead. Extra insurance for your towers. I run one. It also helps this next card...

**Red Eyes Zombie Dragon**

As I said, if you're playing right, you won't need to attack. That being said, REZD allows you to steal your opponent's monsters. When it destroys a Zombie monster, it canspeical summon that monster to your side of the field, from their graveyard. This is an instant mill for your towers. Increasing its attack allows it to steal some pretty great monsters.

~~**Gorz**~~

~~When you summon Gorz with his effect for battle damage, you summon two zombie type monsters (assuming Zombie World is on the field), and a 2700 beatstick. That's pretty nice. It's also great for defending your lonesome little Bone-Tower.~~

My bad.

**The Usual Suspects**

Heavy Storm, Dark Hole, Monster Reborn, Solemn Warning, etc.

**SIDING**

**Imperial Iron Wall**

Yeah, it screws over your Books of Life, but at least this way you won't be losing all your easy summons to banishment.

**Defensive Spells and Traps**

Opponent plays a fast summoning deck? To fast for you to pull up a wall of Towers and Spirit Reapers? Swords of Revealing Light, Negate Attack, Ordeal of the Traveller, are all pretty nasty cards.

**Heavy Beater Monsters**

If your opponent finds some form of clever trickery to beat your mills, there's always attacking. Vampire Genesis, Despair from the Dark, Red Ogre, Endless Decay, Dark Armed Dragon. These are all great cards to beat your opponent. You can still use the Turtles and Masters to bring in easy summons, so it's a nice touch.

**EXTRA DECK**

**Doomkaiser Dragon**

A level 6, so very easy to summon with the L2 Plaguespreader. 2400 atk, so nothing spectacular, but when he is summoned he special summons any zombie from your opponent's graveyard. If you've been milling before this summon, you may be able to pull one of your opponent's beatsticks. Two mills for the price of one.

**Archfiend Zombie Skull**

A Level 6. Requires Plaguespreader, and two other Zombies. Use Pain Painter in place of Plaguespreader. With Pain Painter, you have 3 monsters (including himself) L2, for an easy synchro. It's effect protects all of your faceup Zombies from Card Effects. It makes your Bone Towers nigh invincible.

**Revived King Ha Des**

A level 6. Monsters destroyed by your zombies do not have their effects activated. Allows you to attack with impunity.

**Ally of Justice Catastor**

My favorite Synchro Monster. If Zombie World is on the field, you still get a mill. Destroys any Non-Dark monster it battles with before damage calculation. Use it for that one monster that is screwing you over. Remember, Catastor destroys by effect, not battle.

Enjoy your wall of text. I'll upload a deck skeleton and my deck if there is enough interest.

Greetings, /r/yugioh! I know it has been a long time since my last deck profile, but I assure you that this one will be *more* than worth the wait.

Recently, we in TCG regions have received the *Samurai Warlords* structure deck, giving many players, both old and new, access to key *Six Samurai* cards that previously would be difficult to acquire. Though aiding in accessibility, the release of this structure deck did not accommodate any new strategies for our meta, barring a single Xyz monster with little competitive value. With this being said, it is necessary to note that Japan did *not* receive this structure deck, but rather received a new structure deck with brand new cards for a new archetype.

Here we enter *Atlanteans*. Granted with the abilities to swarm the field with low level *Water* monsters and to gain advantage from using them as costs for more powerful monsters, the cards introduced in this structure set have opened up many possibilities for *Water*-based decks. It is especially because of this deck that people's sights were turned to the new set, *Abyss Rising*, which was promised to bring even *more* support to *Water* monsters, including a brand new *Water* archetype. 

With the release of the *Mermail* archetype to OCG, even before the banlist they have been making quite a splash on the meta, and are expected by some, myself very much so included, to shoot to top tier in OCG shortly after the commencement of this upcoming banlist. Their ability to cycle through the deck and special summon cards, combined with the hand and field advantage provided from their allies, the *Atlanteans*, have made this deck a *very* solid contender for being meta.

Today, I will be covering *both* of these archetypes, how they work together, the plethora of *Water* monsters that help support them, and showcasing the raw potential they have for power and control.

***I will be referring to cards by their*** **Dueling Network** ***names, so there may be minor discrepancies in this guide in that regard due to translations.***

***THIS IS AN EIGHT-PART POST: PLEASE LOOK AT THE COMMENTS FOR THE WHOLE GUIDE.***

***
***
In this first of several segments, I will be discussing the stars of the show, the *Mermails*.

***

**[Mermail - Abyssgunde](http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb57887/yugioh/images/4/42/MermailAbyssgunde-ABYR-JP-C.jpg)**

&gt; Level 3

&gt; Aqua/Water/Effect

&gt; 1400/800

&gt;     If this card is sent from your hand to the Graveyard: You can
&gt;     Special Summon 1 ""Mermail"" monster from your Graveyard, except
&gt;     ""Mermail - Abyssgunde"". The effect of ""Mermail - Abyssgunde"" can
&gt;     only be activated once per turn.
***

* **Abyssgunde** is a very handy little lady, as when she is pitched to the graveyard from the hand by any means, not just as a *Water* monster cost, she can nab one of her comrades from the grave. 

* Even with the ""once per turn"" stipulation that the majority of the *Mermails* have, she is very useful in swarming the field and gaining field advantage for losing hand advantage.

* It is recommended to run 1-2 in mixed builds, *possibly* 3 in pure *Mermail* builds.

**[Mermail - Abysslinde](http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb57887/yugioh/images/1/11/MermailAbysslinde-ABYR-JP-R.jpg)**

&gt; Level 3

&gt; Aqua/Water/Effect

&gt; 1500/1200

&gt;     If this card on the field is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard: You
&gt;     can Special Summon 1 ""Mermail"" monster from your Deck, except
&gt;     ""Mermail - Abysslinde"". The effect of ""Mermail - Abysslinde"" can
&gt;     only be activated once per turn.
***

* One of my personal favorites of the archetype, **Abysslinde** serves as this deck's recruiter. Though her effect can only be used once per turn, there is no limitation on the *Mermail* monster summoned from the deck, meaning that she allows summoning of some *very* powerful and useful combo monsters, even going so far as top open up possibilities for swarming and searching during your *opponent*'s turn.

* We will also be able to, as I will address in full later, utilize destruction rather easily on our own terms with some specific support cards, or with cards such as **Torrential Tribute**.

* Pure *Mermail* builds should be running 2-3, though mixed builds can run anywhere from 0-3 depending on playstyle; I personally opt for 3.

**[Mermail - Abysshilde](http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb57887/yugioh/images/6/62/MermailAbysshilde-ABYR-JP-C.jpg)**

&gt; Level 3

&gt; Aqua/Water/Effect

&gt; 1300/400

&gt;     If this card is sent to the Graveyard: You can Special Summon 1
&gt;     ""Mermail"" monster from your hand, except ""Mermail - Abysshilde"".
&gt;     The effect of ""Mermail - Abysshilde"" can only be activated once per
&gt;     turn.
***

* Though her effect seems very useful, being able to special summon monsters from the hand for an incredibly easy cost (sent as an Xyz Material, from the deck, etc...), it is noteworthy that summoning from the hand is less consistent than summoning from the deck or graveyard, and ultimately can reduce hand advantage before we have the opportunity to restore it.

* Pure *Mermail* builds can run up to 2, but mixed should typically stick with 0-1, as maintaining consistent hand advantage is very important to this deck.

**[Mermail - Abyssturge](http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb57887/yugioh/images/5/59/MermailAbyssturge-ABYR-JP-C.jpg)**

&gt; Level 4

&gt; Fish/Water/Effect

&gt; 1700/1100

&gt;     When this card is Normal or Special Summoned: You can discard 1
&gt;     WATER monster; add 1 Level 3 or lower WATER monster from your
&gt;     Graveyard to your hand. The effect of ""Mermail Abyssturge"" can
&gt;     only be activated once per turn.
***

* Now we enter the first of many *Water* monsters that can take advantage of using the previous *Mermails*, as well as our *Atlanteans*. With respectable attack, and the ability manipulate our graveyard, it is hard to pass up this effect.

* Since the deck will naturally have graveyard manipulation and searching, running 3 of **Abyssturge** can be rather overboard. Any *Mermail* build can safely run up to 2.

**[Mermail - Abysslang](http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb57887/yugioh/images/e/ec/MermailAbysslang-ABYR-JP-C.jpg)**

&gt; Level 4

&gt; Fish/Water/Effect

&gt; 1500/1800

&gt;     While this card is face-up on the field, your opponent cannot target
&gt;     other face-up WATER monsters you control for attacks. While this
&gt;     card is face-up on the field, all WATER monsters you control gain
&gt;     300 ATK.
***

* Though a nice defensive card, creating an attack lock down with 2 on the field, *Mermail*s much prefer taking a bigger offensive by generating hand and field advantage, which this card fails to do.

* If you really want to create an attacking lock down, run 2, but typically you won't be bothering with this card.

**[Mermail - Abysspike](http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb57887/yugioh/images/6/6c/MermailAbysspike-ABYR-JP-R.jpg)**

&gt; Level 4

&gt; Fish/Water/Effect

&gt; 1600/800

&gt;     When this card is Normal or Special Summoned: You can discard 1
&gt;     WATER monster to the Graveyard; add 1 Level 3 WATER monster
&gt;     from your Deck to your hand. The effect of ""Mermail - Abysspike""
&gt;     can only be activated once per turn.
***

* NOW we are talking hand advantage. Fueling our hand is incredibly important for utilizing our other power monsters, and the ease of special summoning **Abysspike** through our lower level *Mermail* monsters and a few other effects allow this card to set up devastating combos.

* Any build should be running 3 of this card due to adding consistency to our power plays.

**[Mermail - Megalobabyss](http://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb57887/yugioh/images/5/53/MermailMegaloabyss-ABYR-JP-SR.jpg)**

&gt; Level 7

&gt; Sea Serpent/Water/Effect

&gt; 2400/1900

&gt;     During your Main Phase: You can discard 2 WATER monsters,
&gt;     except this card; Special Summon this card from your hand. When
&gt;     this card is Special Summoned by this effect: Add 1 ""Abyss"" Spell
&gt;     or Trap Card from your Deck to your hand. You can Tribute 1 other
&gt;     face-up Attack Position WATER monster you control; this turn, this
&gt;     card can attack twice during the Battle Phase.
***

* One of the scariest parts about **Megaloabyss** is that it isn't even this archetype's boss monster.

* The ability to discard 2 *Water* monsters as a cost is only one reason that this card is so good, as it allows activation of 2 other *Water* monster effects, *Mermail* or *Atlantean* in some combination, to gain either hand or field advantage with them; in many cases, this summon can actually result in net gain of hand advantage for you!

* Searching out *Abyss* spells and traps is very helpful too, as they allow for setting up further plays, or simply disrupting the opponent's combos.

* **Megaloabyss** can also set off a 3rd *Atlantean/Mermail* by tributing for his effect to attack twice; since such cards generate key advantage for use when used in this way (as will be elaborated in the next section in regards to *Atlanteans*, using this effect can actually result in pluses for you while you gain potential 4800 damage to inflict against your opponent.

* Pure *Mermail* builds should be running 3 of this card, no questions asked. However, in mixed builds, he can be dropped down to 2 to make room in the deck, especially since we have several means of searching him out.

***

It is hard to detail every single possible combo within this archetype, as every single card can play off each others' effects in one way or another; this diversity is a strong part of what makes this deck so good.

Hopefully y'all are keeping up, as we are going to dive even deeper into this deck's potential. Stay Tuned!

Don't worry, I didn't make this up 5 minutes ago and decide to post it. I've been testing it for 3 hours. I've played about 25 duels against a variety of decks, including many top-tier decks. 

I have only lost 3 duels.

2 duels were lost because of a **Shock Master** calling 'Monster' when I had no other way to kill it.

1 duel was lost from the worst hand ever against EleDrags.

Every other duel I won.

Madolche players, I urge you to give this a shot. You'll never want for a **Hootcake** target. You'll be making a **Queen** most turns. Your opponent will be so shocked by your deck they won't know what to do.

My favourite part of this deck is milling 5+ Madolche monsters then dropping **Chateau**. A Lightsworn deck you can't deck out with!

Makes me wish [this](http://i.imgur.com/BIW1O.jpg) was a real card.

Have fun!

1365990344.0,65,self.yugioh,1cd1hg,"Judge Report- Louisville, KY Regionals",73,8,119,http://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/comments/1cd1hg/judge_report_louisville_ky_regionals/,"Hi guys! I guess this is going to be the first in a series on being a Yu-Gi-Oh judge. First, a little about me. I've been playing Yu-Gi-Oh competitively since YCS Atlanta 2012; doesn't seem like a long time, but I've come very far. Since I started judging in August 2012, I have now judged: locals every week, 2 GA regionals, 2 AL regionals, 2 sneak peaks, and YCS Austin. I am one of the very few female judges and my home store is Crimson Castle Games, in Tuscaloosa, AL. That being said, look forward to even more judge reports in the future!


**Louisville Regional Report**

We started off the day strong. Judges get there, most always, before the players are even allowed in. That being said, I'm there at 7:30 AM to start helping set-up. We open at 8 AM, and the players are already piling up outside the doors. Good for them, because our capacity is only 235 players.

**Fun Fact: Capacity is a relatively new thing, which can be located on the regionals page on the yugioh-card website. Once a venue hits capacity, there is no extending beyond capacity. Get there early!**

Our Head Judge today is John Rocha, a very famous name in the judge community. Our Assistant Head Judge is Will Falta, another very famous name in the judge community. Scorekeeper is Michael Sewell, again, very famous in the judge community. So immediately, I'm like ""holy cow, if there's a time to impress, today is it!"". 

Doors open, players flood in.

**Fun Fact: 2/3 of judging is player management; 1/3 is logistics.**

I'm immediately in charge of deck-checking. Most of the judges that worked this event were new, brand new, very-first-event new. That's fine, it's a learning process. I teach them how to deck-list check; it's a balance of speed/accuracy. This is the logistics side. I give myself a bit less than a minute to completely check a deck list. I circle and confirm totals in main/side/extra, make sure there are no errors, such as illegal cards. Another, little thing, is to make sure that players get their last initial correct. Apparently, many players do not know the first letter of their last name. We need that to be correct to sort the deck lists later. Deck list checking can be an absolute nightmare; if a player doesn't stick around nearby, and has an illegal deck list, we have to call him over the loudspeaker/attempt to find him.

**Fun Fact: Just because it has been released in duel terminal? Doesn't mean it's a legal card. Evilswarms and Constellars are not legal cards to play just yet. I had a player with Constellars hand me his deck list; sorry buddy, gonna need a new deck!**

We ended up turning away 70~ players; again, once capacity has been reached, we literally cannot fit any more players in the venue. This causes much rage, but the Tournament Organizer (TO) stands firm. The cops get called on us actually, to enforce the fire code. At that point, we kick all non-players out. After initial announcements, and a final run down of logistics (who's standing where, who's doing what), the event starts! I'm on Deck Check Team for this event; I've been Deck Check Lead before, and I take on that role again, partnered with a rookie judge. We always work in teams. Most players see Deck Checks as a curse, and they sometimes can be. For most rounds, I gave out at least a warning, and commonly a Game Loss.

**Fun Fact: Deck Checks are, in fact, for the most part, random checks to make sure your deck is legal/not marked/matches your deck list. They take about 5-15 minutes (depending on severity/what we catch). We have nothing against you, unless your deck has been flagged by another judge.**

*Interesting Note*: For this event, I had a match where I gave out three game losses- not a happy time for those involved. Player A had extra cards in his deck box and marked sleeves (Marked Cards- Minor- Warning, Deck Error- Major- Game Loss). Player B had a card not listed on his deck list that he was playing, and a few marked cards such as a BLS-EOTB (same penalties as A). They both get a game-loss, and have 3 minutes to find replacements/new sleeves. Player B was so angry, he left and didn't ever come back. Player A gets the win.

I proceed through the day, giving out Game Losses left and right for simple, fixable things. Only keep your deck in your deckbox, nothing else. Extra cards in your deck box is a **Game Loss** for first offense, upgradable to Match Loss or Disqualification if it's a repeat offense. Tokens are fine, just no extra YuGiOh cards. Another note: buy new sleeves before every event. I know it seems cruel and a waste of money, but sleeves, played often, wear out quickly. Marked/old/frayed sleeves are the most common penalty reason. 

Every round, we choose at least one table to deck check, starting randomly (tables 1-120) and eventually start doing 1-40, 1-20, picking a random number from that range. Sometimes, we do a mid-round deck check; after Game 1 or Game 2, we'll stop you after you've already sided and presented, and we'll do a deck check then. Afterwards, for the rest of the round, my partner and I are free to floor judge!

**Fun Fact: There are three judge teams: Paper Team, Deck Check Team, and Floor Team. Paper and Deck Check end up floor judging when they are not currently involved in their various duties.**

As an semi-experienced judge, I jump right in to help the rookies out. The most common thing they need to work on is confidence; even if you don't know a ruling, pretend like you do and give your answer with authority. No ""um""s or ""uh""s. One calls me over for a Rescue Rabbit Ruling.

&gt; Can I activate Rescue Rabbit's effect when there are 4 monsters on my side of the field, including the rabbit?

The answer is yes. A YCS has ruled that it is allowed, and in lieu of an official R&amp;D ruling, we go by YCS rulings. How did I know this? There's a handy-dandy judge application, for Androids and iProducts. Download it; you'll need it to judge and it helps when you play, giving you rulings and the most updated card text for a card. It's called Yu-Gi-Oh Rules Resource (just search rules resource). **CAVEAT** The app is still in beta phase and not all the rulings on it are confirmed. I personally just use it for updated card text, from which I can discern most rulings.

Other basic questions for the day:

&gt; Does Catastor target?

&gt; Are take-backs allowed in Yu-Gi-Oh?

&gt; Judge, my opponent has an extra card in his hand, that's not fair, what do I do?


The answers to above are no, no, and game loss for opponent after investigation. The day drags on, with more and more deck checks, a lovely lunch break, and lots of simple, benign rulings that can be solved by reading your card. Sometimes though, rulings aren't so simple when we have to do investigations. An investigation is when players do a ""he said she said"". The judge will sit down with you, and generally runs you through the story twice for both players. 

*Interesting Note*: We had a he-said-she-said where I had two stories.

Player A: I activated Dragon's Ravine while my opponent wasn't paying attention. I searched my deck, added, and then was moving to activate another Ravine by picking up the old one to move it to the graveyard. 

Player B: My opponent has an extra card in his hand! I didn't see him activate Ravine, and he should only have 6!

It was ruled that Player B was correct, and Player A had an extra card. Player A came up to complain to me later that this had happened to him, but the Head Judge ruled, and what the Head Judge says, goes.


So, we finish Swiss at around 8 PM; great time!!! I unfortunately ducked out early to get home, missing Top 8, but I did lead the Top 8 Deck Check. I taught all the judges a valuable trick: the infamous drop test.

**Fun Fact: A drop test is when we pick up your deck, raise it 3 or 4 inches, and drop it back on to the table. Marked/bent cards will cause the deck to slide slightly to the side where the marked card is, indicating its location. If we can pick out the same card 3-4 times, it's a marked card.**


And that was the end of the day! I hope this was helpful, informative, useful, interesting, whatever. Let me know if I need to add anything else/if you want to see something/know something.

**TL;DR- Marked cards are bad. Get to the event on time. Judges are not out to get you when they deck check you. Days are long, pack a water bottle. Above all, be friendly and polite, whether you are a judge or player!**",,False,self,t5_2rpe6,1366073910.0,,wind,True,t3_1cd1hg,http://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/comments/1cd1hg/judge_report_louisville_ky_regionals/,

By watching a recent video by the Yugituber Mkohl40, I discovered that he and many other yugioh players have created a survey to determine the overall spirit of current players. Many of us have been bothered with the power creep in the game and the ""broken"" format we are currently in. This survey is to show Konami our disatisfaction with the current direction of the game. According to Mkohl40, this survey will be posted on Pojo, DuelingNetwork, Devpro, and many other yugioh forums. I for one support the idea of showing our disapproval of the current game state and hoping that Konami will listen to our voice and make changes to the game.

If you are interested in helping I will post links to Mkohl's video and the survey itself,

I want to make a more or less comprehensive video talking about the game today (March 2013 Format) and the different rules and mechanics one must follow in order to play. I want to start from the most basic things like ""you start a duel with 8000 LP, not 4000"", and ""a deck shouldnt have 60 cards"", etc to something like chaining and spell speeds, basic rulings, etc. I will encompass everything in the ruling guide and more.

Well, I would like you all to suggest any topics you would like covered in this video. Avoid the basic stuff, and suggest anything you think players are lacking in today (good manners, anyone?) or things most people dont know.

In a later video, if this one is popular, I will include tips and tricks for beginners: Such as when and when not to solemn warning, BTH, TT, etc.

That was the first game.”  I then pointed out that I sided and so did he.  He then says, “Oh that’s right, I won that game.”  Upset I was going to forfeit a game because I didn’t have any proof I won, I asked, “Well which is it? There wasn’t a game before this or you won that game?” He then just gives me a silent look.  I try to talk to others around me if they remember if I won the first game (which I swear I won, Reddit), and no one could back me up for sure.  The judge decided that since no one could prove that they won, there would be a timed sudden death duel (Yu-Gi-Oh!, not pistols).  We dueled and I had him on the ropes with three high-powered monsters.  And then the judge called time.  I was losing by 500 lifepoints, 4300 to 4800.  Even though I had not lost a single duel, I had lost the match.  He offers his hand for me to shake, and I say quietly so no one else can hear, “I can’t shake your hand because you know I won that first duel.”  He produced a tinge of red I had never seen before, and wore a look of guilt that satisfied me slightly.

Saying goodbye to the game.",95,32,203,http://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/comments/16kpxx/selling_decks_mats_other_cards_saying_goodbye_to/,"Hey guys, I'm going to give up Yugioh because of many reasons but I'd prefer to keep them private. To those who have yet to receive their cards from me, I've sent them out today. I apologize for not sending them earlier so I'm kicking in a couple of cards to you for being a dick. 


I am working on getting the exact decklists for the decks because I shifted them around and wanted to try new things. I am only writing this to see if I can spark interest for people wanting to buy a whole deck or just piece it out. 


As a frequent redditor of this sub, I'm going to give many many deals and discounts for all who purchase. For example, if something is $10, I'll sell it for $8. I'll throw in gag cards because I got useless randoms and stuff. If you do buy a whole deck, I'll give you the monster double deckbox that it is in, some rogue sleeves, and a free playmat if not bought. All of these decks will include a side deck (to some extent) and an extra deck.


Anyways, I have 3 decks and part of a 4th. 


The first deck is my Chaos Dragons. I have topped many a locals with this deck. My dream was to take this bad boy into regionals and get top. However, that's not going to happen clearly so I want to give the buyer of this deck the chance to do so. This will come in a red monster double deck box, red sleeves, and a dragunity mat


The second deck is Laval Quasar. I used to have Cardcar D's but sold those for some fast cash. The deck has the core and of course, Quasar. The main deck isn't an arm and a leg but the extra deck is worth quite a lot just for the fact that Quasar is in it. This comes with a green double deckbox, green sleeves

The third deck is Agents. This is my girlfriend's deck and she was pretty good at it for a beginner. The extra deck is a bit steep just because of having both catastor and daigusto phoenix but it's still good. Comes with a purple double deckbox, purple sleeves, and an agent playmat (again, pixelated but still is cool). This one will also come with a mat tube.


As for the partial fourth, it is Gravekeeper's and they are all hollow but I don't have of course all of them. I'll piece these out or if someone wants them all, I'll give it to them for a steal. 

I also have cards that hold a good value in my binder but everything else, I'll just give out for free to people who buy. 


I'm still debating on values at the moment but I will post the decks soon. I just want to see if people get interested.


Important note: I will ONLY sell these cards. If I get any offers for trade, you will not get a reply. Please just respect my thread. 


I will miss being in the game but I will pop in here every once in a while and be on DN every so often.

Though when she dumped me I fell back into my old lifestyle and started having severe depression and terrible thoughts and it just ate at me slowly everyday.

I deleted all my social media and basically committed social suicide because I wanted to disappear from everything. But, instill kept reddit, and looked on this subreddit a lot to just try to distract myself and see what was going on. I looked at binders, deck guides, and just funny posts from the community and all I can say is, thank you. You have all helped in someway for me to keep getting out of bed. I still think about her bit you all have helped be a positive distraction and to help me clear my mind.

1369052853.0,62,self.yugioh,1eougq,Let's talk: Evilswarm Tech.,75,13,74,http://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/comments/1eougq/lets_talk_evilswarm_tech/,"Hey guys, long time Evilswarm player here and I'm ready to show you some of the great tech I've come across and have been testing over the last few weeks; you'll have to bear with me as I'm typing this all out on my phone so the formatting might be a little shoddy. 


**-Intro-** 

First of all, let's talk next format meta, and why Evilswarm. Personally I play Evilswarm because I do not have the money for Spellbook of Judgement or 3 x Big Eye and 3 x Dracossack, I cannot afford to play top tier meta. Also, I'm of the opinion that decks like E-Dragons are very heavily hyped and are VERY easily countered, especially by the only anti deck of the format, E-Swarm. 

Just to give you an idea of what these techs are like. I went to UK nationals and on Sunday I entered a side event; I played 4 rounds of Swiss that went like this: 2-0 spellbook, 2-0 E-drags, 2-0 E-Drags, 2-0 E-Drags. The top 4 cut had me playing mermail and I 2-0'd him as well. I lost the final to: Evilswarm mirror. 

Now, I'm not a very good player at all, I made a lot of misplays during that tourney (I tried to use *Rescue Rabbit* while my own *Imperial Iron Wall* was out. So I attribute my victories (and eventual loss) to my choice of tech.

Here are what Evilswarm need to win against current meta; 

**E-Drags**

&gt;First turn *Ophion* with some form of backup protection against *Blaster*. (*Forbidden Dress, Safe Zone, Dark Illlusion, XYZ Reborn*) 

&gt;First turn *Shock Master*. 

**Prophecy** 

&gt;First turn *Eradicator Epidemic Virus*.

&gt; First turn *Shock Master* 

I managed to pull these all off early game in every game, and I'll show you how it is possible this format and with new cards in JOTL. 

**Tech: Kagetokage** 

My staple card and I love him. I run 3. He cannot be normal summoned or set but can be special summoned from your hand when you normal summon a monster. He is 4 Stars and a Dark Reptile. Already being played a lot in Gadgets, he is a generic *Wind-Up Shark* and is also a target for *Allure of Darkness*. He also makes turn 1 *Shock Master* plays very easily and kills first turn *LaDD*. Here are some example plays. 

Going first. Normal summon *Rescue Rabbit*, reveal and special summon *Kagetokage*, use *Rescue Rabbits* effect, special two *Heliotrope*, overlay for Shock Master and call Spells/Monsters. GG. 

Going second. Opponent has *Dracossack* and *LaDD* on the field. Normal summon *Evilswarm Castor*, reveal *Kagetokage*.  It gets negated, *LaDD* loses 500 points and *Kage* remains in hand. Normal summon Evilswarm Heliotrope and use *Kage* again. *LaDD* is now 1800. Overlay for *Ophion*, attack the *LaDD*. It dies and takes the *Draco* out with it and cannot special summon any of the Dragons in the grave except the babies. Proceed to win the game. My opponent was so salty once I did this. 

As you can see, I love this little lizard. He opens up a lot more options for Evilswarm, I'll reveal some of them soon. 

**Tech: Eradicator Epidemic Virus** 

I main deck 3 no questions ask. The ability to shut down Spellbooks before they even start their cannot be overlooked. If you chain *EEV* to a spellbook, things like *Star Hall* and *Spellbook Tower* miss the timing. It is dead against dragons but you should win G1 anyway. G2 I side it out for imperial iron wall. I might counterside it back in G3 depending on how much backrow/Ophion hate they side in. 

**Tech: Number 66: Master Key Beetle**

Probably being released in JOTL; this is what Evilswarm have needed for a long time. Make this with 2 Level 4 darks (*Kagetokage*!!). It is 2500 and a dark so instantly you get your EEV live if you can't open *Ophion*. Also it's protection effect is great. If you detach one it can target one card you control and that card cannot be destroyed by card effects. Target your *Ophion* and *Blaster* can't touch it. Target your *Vanity's Emptiness* and it can't be destroyed by its own effect. Your opponent might as well scoop after that, you just have yourself a costless  *Royal Oppression*. It's a great, great card and I cannot wait for its release. 

**Tech: Dark Illusion** 

Personally I don't like it and prefer *Forbidden Dress*, but it wrecks in the mirror match. I lost my final because I tried to *Bahamut* my opponent's *Ophion* and he flipped this on me. Might be one to consider testing. 

**Tech: Reptilliane Vaskii** 

A card that, while may not see competitive play (I'll probably drop it) is incredibly fun and worth mentioning. It's a Level 8 Dark Reptile (so if it's dead you can Allure it). Let's say your opponent opens Dracossack and 2 tokens. You can make an *Ophion* but it won't do you any good. Instead you summon a *Heliotrope* and *Kagetokage* and overlay for *King of the Feral Imps* (which you should be playing anyway because you 're going to be playing Kagetokage duh ;P) . You use it to search out *Reptilliane Vaskii* and special summon her by tributing the two *Dracossack* tokens. Pop *Draco* with her effect and attack directly for 4900 damage.  I would only do this though if there was no chance in making *Bahamut*. Stealing an opponents *Draco* is the most satisfying play. In the side tourney I managed to steal a *Big Eye* with a *Bahamut* and then *Draco* with *Big Eye*. Many jizzes we're had. 

**Tech: XYZ Reborn** 

This one isn't new but with these cards I've just mentioned it gets better. If you open *Ophion, EEV and XYZ Reborn*, flip the EEV and chain the *Reborn* for game. Use *Reborn* to revive a dead *Ophion* popped by *Blaster*. Get back *Shock Master* for another turn of negation. I only run 1 because it can be dead but I might test 2. 


**Tech: Number 69: Heraldry Crest**

So you've stalled your opponent for 3 turns with *Shock Master* and somehow haven't managed to win. You're holding *Kerykion* and *Kagetokage* in your hand. You need to stall them for longer but you don't run 2 *Shock Master* (this is why I do), what do you do? Simple, overlay for *Number 69*! You can copy your own *Shock Master*  and have a 2600 attack *Shock Master* for possibly 3 more turns! If you want to search *Infestation Pandemic* but don't want your *Ophion* to lose it's last material, make this little dude, copy *Ophion* and search away. His name even becomes *Ophion* so *Pandemic* protects it! 

I'll close up with an example of a play in which I used this guy IRL. My opponent had *Big Eye*, *Dracossack*, and my stolen *Bahamut*. I have a dead *Rescue Rabbit* and *Evilswarm Mandragora*and draw into *Kagetokage*. I SS *Mandrogora*, normal summon *Rabbit*, special *Kage*. I overlay all 3 for Number 69. I use Number 69 to copy *Big-Eye* and take *Big Eye*. I use my new *Big-Eye* to take *Dracossack*. I just turned 3 dead cards into 3 amazing cards. My opponent wasn't even salty and congratulated me. **EDIT**: As pointed out this was an illegal play and I completely forgot to mention it in the body of my post. Number 69 negates the effects of all current xyz monsters on the field when summoned, so I would not have been able to use my opponents Big Eye. Neither of us noticed until the end of the game where the judge ruled it as an accepted game state so my win still stood. It was only game one so not a big deal but I still feel bad for soft cheating even though it was an accident. 

So there we have it, that's all the Tech I've thought of and tested out so far. I hope some of you guys could test some of this and report any successes, failures and other ideas you've had. 

Thanks for reading this wall of text if you've got this far. 


**TL:DR; read the fucking post if you're that desperate, I can't summarise all of this in a few lines! -_-**

Some guidelines you may or may not want to follow:

- The shittier the picture, the better.

- It's better if you try to draw from memory, but if your work of art turns out to be an abomination, you can look up the artwork.

- Cards shouldn't be super-obscure, i.e. printed 10 years ago OCG only and never reprinted ever again. For example: Alien Shocktrooper is okay, [Ancient Tool](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Ancient_Tool) is not.

- Doodles can be in color or non-color.

I made a post a couple of weeks ago letting you guys know about my new Yugioh card prices website project http://YugiohPrices.com and asking you for your feedback.  Well I got a whole lot of feedback, and I figured that now that things have settled down for this development cycle at least, that it would be a good idea to let you know what's been changed and improved.

You can view a full summary of release notes on the news page of the website if you'd like here.
http://yugiohprices.com/news#updates_5_27_13

But here's the TL;DR version for you impatient types.

- No more listings for things like Harpie Channeler sneaking their way into listings for more popular/expensive cards like Dracossack because the person who posted the listing included the wrong card number.  (On purpose or otherwise)

- I've added columns to the card listings tables that now show you the edition (first, limited, unlimited, etc), rarity, and condition for each listing.  You can also sort listings by any of these attributes now, and since they all have special weight calculations included with them, listings will still be kept in lowest to highest price order even when you drill down by a secondary attribute.

- Integrated TCGPlayer listings into the website.

- Added a Top 50 most expensive cards page to show off what's popular and expensive right now.

The iOS app has already been updated to implement all of these improvements made to the website.  Also fear not Android users, there' an Android version in the works!  As always, I would appreciate your feedback and suggestions.

Oh, and it would be just dandy if someone could update the sidebar to include a link to YugiohPrices.com under the ""Find Card Prices"" section since everything listed on TCGPlayer and eBay is already included. :)",,False,self,t5_2rpe6,False,,blank,True,t3_1f61tb,http://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/comments/1f61tb/updates_to_yugiohpricescom/,

I've been sick these past few days, so that has been contributing to why I haven't been posting much as of late. That's why I want to make it up to you guys.

I have a code for a free pizza from Papa John's Pizza giveaway, but it expires tomorrow evening. I am pretty sure that I won't be eating it, so that's why I wanted to give you guys first dibs.

There is only one code, so there *is* a catch: all you have to do is tell your ***best*** Yugioh story. It could be about a tournament experience, an epic duel, some epic pulls, cosplay shenanigans, some art you've drawn, or anything that is even vaguely related to Yugioh.

I won't be the judge however; *you guys will*. ***The comment that gets the most karma will be receiving the code for the pizza.*** There are no restrictions on how anyone upvotes any comments (upvote all of them for all I'm concerned!), just please don't downvote others *just* to improve your chances: try to play it fair!

***

I'll set the deadline for this at 7:30 PM, Central Time (e.g. Chicago). The winner will be decided then! Unfortunately, due to restrictions on the code, only American redditors will be able to use it. My apologies to everyone else.

In the event of a tie, the two users will have to duel for it, increasing the stakes!

This is your opportunity to share anything you want with the community, to show off, to brag, and to have a good time! Will ***your*** Yugioh experience earn you a free pizza? There's only one way to find out!

[Proof that I do in fact have the code](http://imgur.com/4EDqE).

1351487963.0,59,self.yugioh,129f34,Guide to Improving play Part.1,68,9,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/comments/129f34/guide_to_improving_play_part1/,"Alright so since we have been talking about trying to improve this sub and there still being a lack of fulfilling content I have decided to start doing a weekly segment to talk about different aspects of the game and ways to improve. It's going to focus on more competitive styles rather than casual. Any way on to the guide:

Part 1. Knowledge.

In any competitive card game there is one thing that every top tier player needs, and this is knowledge. Now I know this is kinda vague but its true every player needs it, and will thrive with the more knowledge they have. Now let's get into a little more specifics.

--Knowledge of your deck. I feel like this is the best stepping stone to become a great player. Know your deck, know every play, every combo, every card even in your deck. This is valuable information. Knowing everything your deck can do is key to being able to get out of tight spots or to over run your opponent. Spending time just continually testing your deck to see plays that can happen is awesome, you might learn knew ones just try it. Always know what you have yourself.

-- Knowledge of the Meta. This one is slightly more complex but still overall easy. A good player will always know how to play against every deck he faces. And this stems from just knowing the other decks out there. Say your opponent sets a monster in face down defence position, having knowledge of the meta will allow you to know what that card may be, right know ryko is popular in chaos decks, snowman is still widely played, and geargias have there's as well. Knowing this information is crucial in how you play around certain cards. Such as ryko, do you really want to attack into it or can you bait out a flip for something you don't care about. It all comes from knowledge.

-- Knowledge of Rules. This one is probably the most tricky, and the toughest to master. Knowing your rules is crucial though in becoming a better player. Knowing when and when you can't activate things is huge. How well do you know the battle phase? Do you know when to activate your lance? Do you know the ruling on you're new pretty cards? Stuff like this comes in handy when you are playing at a high level, I can't tell you how many times I have seen people miss play with things like safe zone, not knowing the targeting ruling, or miss playing with stardust and stuff like that, or even smaller miss plays about not knowing what proper substep to activate your forbidden lance. This all boils down to knowledge of the rules.

-- Knowledge of your Match. Last but not least is paying attention to your opponent and knowing what they may have or knowing certain free information they give you. Such as hand size, knowing a persons hand size can be very useful in determining big moves of yours. If they have a small hand size and small board presence then maybe its time to push and go for game knowing they have the limited resources and might not be able to recover. Or the exact opposite maybe they have a large hand and playing conservative may be wiser to help bait out some of there power cards into your outs. Also this goes hand in hand with knowing the meta as well. If your opponent is going to give you free information remember that information. If your opponent uses pot of duality remember all the cards that are shown, not just what is taken, knowing what is still left in an opponents deck can be just as valuable as knowing what's in his hand. Oh my opponent last turn showed me he has 1 bottomless, and has another in grave, plus both torrentials used, well let's try and push considering negation resources are limited. And others. Just always know everything you can.

I hope this is good for my first post ever. I am writing on a phone so sorry if the writing is a little funky. Feel free to add anything as I am sure there is more.

*Fire Fists* are going to be ***the*** new slashable archetype, needing only 6-7 slots in any given deck to run as a self-sufficient engine. Though spacing was tricky, the synergy with *HERO*s was too good to pass up for me, and illustrates how much **Bear** well become a power card in this upcoming meta as a powerful tech, let alone what it can do in its own decks.

Consistency is *awesome* in this build. It is incredibly easy to get the ball rolling for your *HERO* or *Fire Fist* Cards very easily, and they thin the deck out to make it easier to draw into the other. The monster destruction effect of **Bear** compliments very nicely with how the *HERO* cards establish field presence. 6 directly searching spell cards is phenomenal for deck thinning and getting the exact hands/monsters I need. **Cardcar D** could perhaps work here, but with the deck pressed for space, and me wanting to avoid going about 42-43 cards, I opted out of using it, seeing as there should be plenty of searching as is, for both the engines. The main focus of this deck is the *HERO* engine, however, as this is where the true power plays come from (**Miracle Fusion**.)

The Extra Deck is essentially a standard *HERO* extra, though without Synchros like **Catastor** (**Veiler** as the Tuner) or **Stardust** (I used **Huge Revolution** over **Starlight Road**.) I instead focused more on the Xyz Monsters outside of the omni-*HERO* fusions, including the incredible **Dire Wolf** aka Super **Exiled Force** and **Tiger King** for some mass-negation.

Since *HERO*s have a good match-up against a lot of decks already with the heavy Trap line-up, I could be a slight bit more specific with my Side Deck choices, particularly with the option of using **Prohibition**, which I think will see increased usage pretty soon as a side card. **Gorilla** and **Tensu** are for if I think that the *Fire Fist* cards are going to be more useful, and/or I need more Spell/Trap hate, while **Alius** is there if I want to increase my consistency with **Spark** and **Hero Blast**. The other cards should be mostly self explanatory, such as **Poisonous Winds** being (less) anti-*Harpie* and (more) anti-*Phantom Beastcraft*.

If you are familiar with and comfortable with *HERO* decks, then give **Bear** and **Tenki** a shot in your deck, if you can find the room. I'm still playing with card counts (e.g. **Miracle Fusion** at 2 or 3), but nonetheless what I've got so far has been an enjoyable twist for this archetype which has left many opponents surprised and shortly afterwards easily crushed. Going into **Excalibur** for a direct 4000 after popping a monster with a surprise **Bear/Tenki** is wonderful.

This particular build is far from perfect, but I'll be damned if it hasn't been an enjoyable and fresh experience, even if it is with familiar faces!",,False,self,t5_2rpe6,1359858872.0,,divine,True,t3_17sb4j,http://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/comments/17sb4j/do_you_like_heros_but_want_a_way_to_spice_things/,

I don't hate you for playing Rabbit. This is all about the card and what it does, not the people who use it (though I will briefly go over that issue too).

-------

------

First, [Rescue Rabbit](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Rescue_Rabbit) is a card that has undoubtedly made a huge impact on the meta, just like it's sibling [Rescue Cat](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Rescue_Cat) did when it was around. Rescue Rabbit has, however, created what seems to be a permanent shift in perspective, as opposed to a shift in meta.

Let me explain. Everyone is excited about the new Harpie support coming out, right? So what was the first thing that people thought to do now that Harpies might be viable? Rabbit Harpie. What did people do when they saw the Noble Knight archetype start to roll around? Rabbit Light/Warrior. Lswarm? You get the picture. Instead of using the support these archetypes were designed to be used with, everyone wants to ""innovate"" and make the next Dino Rabbit. Which is alright, innovation is fine. When it's actually innovation. The thing is, everyone seems to throw in their 6 vanillas, the TGU engine, their two Rabbits, and MAYBE some specific support. It's almost comical, honestly.

Now I'm not gonna sit here and tell you it's a bad card and you should feel bad for using it. It's powerful, undeniably. It is literally a 1 card XYZ, just like Cat was a 1 card Synchro. Of course people use it. I don't think it's healthy for the perspective of the playerbase though. It leads to skewed perceptions of how decks should be built, or the game should be played. Don't worry I'm not here to tell you how to play the game either. But when is it okay for 1 card to create a whirlwind of concept-clones that override actual innovation in deck building? You don't create the Zombie Monarchs and Grandsoil psychics by trying to see if you can shoehorn Rabbit into every archetype, and I think that both casual and competitive players might want to take a step back and look at what it is they're trying to do with the game when they run the Rabbit.

Again, I am NOT suggesting that you're a toxic player for playing Rabbit. I wouldn't even say that about Chain Burn. All I'm suggesting is that you make sure you know what you're doing when you type Rescue into the DN searchbox.",,False,self,t5_2rpe6,False,,earth,True,t3_154h6l,http://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/comments/154h6l/i_really_dislike_what_rescue_rabbit_has_done_to/,

Which is totally fine! This looks like a great place to learn. But I thought that maybe if there was a good guide on different aspects of the game, you might not have to post your deck looking for advice, you might know how to fix it yourself. (learning is good, I'm not insulting anyone :D)

1 STAPLES

These cards are generally considered staples. http://imgur.com/JkRVn

Most people, when building a deck, try to fit the majority of these cards into it. I'm sure you've seen youtube videos where people get to the spell and traps and go 'MST, reborn, hole, heavy, all staples'. But no one ever explains why. Here goes.

MST - It's a quickplay spell that destroys your opponents spell/trap. Good to set during your turn, or to clear up some scary backrow before you combo or push for game.

Dark Hole - It's a board wipe. A card that can destroy all of your opponent's monsters, keeping you alive/setting you up for a clear field to have fun with.

Monster Reborn - Can revive a boss monster/combo piece/general card that you need at that time, from either player's grave. And it's a normal spell card.

Heavy Storm - If you weren't playing in the format where we had Only Giant trunade to get rid of massive backrow, you'll never REALLY know why this card keeps people from setting four traps. It can destroy solemn warnings, royal decrees, divine wraths, book of moon, anything your opponent has set face down in the backrow. Use this card just before you combo/push for game to ensure that your play is uninterrupted.

Book of Moon - Arguably not a staple. It can disrupt synchro/Xyz plays or stop an attack.

Solemn Warning/Judgment - These cards will stop a combo before it happens. They make sure that priority can't be called to a monster effect. With solemn Judgment, you can also stop a spell/trap card like dark hole from activating.

Torrential - A chainable version of Dark Hole (kinda). It'll stop a combo, board wipe, and allows you to come back from behind, same as dark hole.

Mirror Force - Another board wipe in a trap card.

Effect Veiler - This card allows you to (once again) stop a large combo or push-for-game from your opponent (depending on the deck). A well timed effect veiler will devastate wind-ups, inzektors, and many many other decks. Because it's a hand trap (card you discard from the hand), it isn't stopped by royal decree or dark bribe, so it almost always goes off, making it VERY reliable.

Maxx 'C' - This is new to the staples. Most top decks will play it in some number. It's a good card because, like veiler, it's a hand trap that will either shut down an opponent's combo, or allow you to draw many many cards, making it easier to recover from said combo. Most people will see Maxx 'c' and stop comboing.


Not all of those cards should be in every single deck though. Half of them are arguably not even staples, but for this purpose, I'll include them. Use common sense. If you're playing a Macro deck, don't run moster reborn. If you play a deck with royal decree, you don't need a mirror force. etcetc

2 THE ENGINE

The engine of a deck is what makes it go. It allows you to combo/get a boss monster/win the game. Here are just a few examples of engines.

[Frog engine](http://imgur.com/au5Bk)
[TG engine](http://imgur.com/fGokY)
[D hero engine](http://imgur.com/WntdO)
[Flamvell engine](http://imgur.com/6Guzv)

and etcetc (note that these are just off the top of my head, engines ave multiple variants)

You use your engine to get your kill mechanic (how you win). For frogs, they're most often used to sacrifice for Monarchs, while Flamvells are used to spam synchro monsters. When building a deck, you should try and identify the most important cards that allow you to win. That's probably your engine. Refine that before anything else. If you have to drop a bottomless trap hole because you fell like you need  third Diamond Dude, do it. Without a consistent engine, you'll be in trouble.

3 TECH

Tech is what you add to the deck to keep it consistent or to make it win. An example would be using Dark Armed Dragon in a blackwing deck. Although most blackwing decks run DAD, it isn't a part of the blackwing archetype, so it's tech in the deck. Tech can allow you to draw cards, kill cards, summon cards, or more. Tech is most commonly used to refer to a special addition that a player has made to their deck, that isn't seen in most other decks of that type. An example is running magical merchant in a Lightsworn deck (something that I do). But really, tech is anything that isn't a staple or part of your engine/deck's archetype.

4 CHOOSING WHAT TO BUILD

When choosing what deck to build, you need to look at various aspects. How much will this deck cost? Is it played by other people in the meta? If not, why? Is it worth building this?

Cost should be obvious, decks are expensive sometimes, and you should examine any investment that you make.

Finding out if the deck is played by anyone else in the meta will help you figure out whether or not it's good (really useful when you're new). If you youtube 'teleDAD' you won't find many results for March 2012. The reason for that, is that it just isn't really playable in this format. When you're new, and can't tell for yourself if a deck will be good, try youtubing it for results. It isn't overly reliable, but when there is no other source, it should help.

Try building something meta when you start out. Meta is a deck that is used by many people. Building toons is fine, but you'll quickly learn why most people don't play that deck. At the same time, don't build Rescue Rabbit without learning how to play the game first. Throwing $1000+ into cards won't make you good. Learning to play will make you good. If you start with a toon deck, and work on that, try and MAKE it great. Failing to make a deck fantastic is the best way to learn. I started out with a structure deck warrior gemini deck that sucked ass. But that's what made me learn.

Most important in this, is ask someone for help. Seek out someone at locals who knows what they're doing and ask if they'll help you. This allows you to sit down one-on-one with someone more experienced to find out what makes your deck tick.

This subreddit in combination with DN screenshots is always great too.

6 LAST STEP, CUT AWAY THE NON-ESSENTIALS

Perhaps most important is NOT using cards that aren't needed. Most decks should be 40 cards. Not even 'as close to as possible', but 40 cards. If you have a card in your deck that is there 'for that guy that plays dragons' it should probably come out and head to  the side deck. You don't need 'just in case' cards. I know I used to build this way, and wound up with 53 card decks, wondering why I wasn't drawing what I needed. Keep your card total low, and you'll see that you get what you need more often.

*phew* I think that about does it, pros tell me what you think, newbies you tell me what you think. If anyone actually liked this I can do more. Side deck tips, trading tips, whatever you want.

Last thing, if you want to, check out my team's youtube channel. I'm the only one that posts anything on it these days, but I try to do so fairly regularly. http://www.youtube.com/user/TeamBolshevik?feature=mhee

Thanks! Let me know if this was worth the time!

Watch out for the seller Realgooddeal. I bought 5 hidden arsenal 7 packs from them and every pack had been opened, the secret rare taken out and replaced with a super, and then resealed. A friend of mine has had a few issues too, he ordered a ghost rare heroic champion Excalibur and they sent him a secret rare. They told him he could send it back and get the right rarity, or take a partial refund. He sent it back and was told that if he wanted the ghost rare he would have to buy another item so that they wouldn't lose money on shipping. He  ended up buying a hidden arsenal special edition booster box from them about a week later, he sent them a message before he bought it to remind them to send the excalibur (You can probably guess where this is going). He waits a little over a week and what does he find in the mail, one single special edition box and no Excalibur.   Right now he's messaging them and trying to either get his money back (65 dollars) or get his other 9 boxes.

Recently I've been seeing a bunch of people asking about Chaos Agents, builds and good techs. I've been running Agents every day for the last 2 and a half formats. This is a bit of an introductory guide about Chaos Agents and what they should include and why:

**1.0 The Core of the Deck**

- This is the core of every Agent deck, what they absolutely need to include

__________________________________________________________

**1.1 The Monsters!**

*1.1.1 The Agents!*

- **Master Hyperion**: He is the boss monster. An easy to summon 2700 atk beater. Banish an Agent from hand, field or graveyard to SS this guy and use his popping effect (Banish 1 light-fairy to destroy one card on the field). Integral in the OTK. **RUN 3**

- **The Agent of Mystery - Earth**: She is the searcher, on normal summon she searches any Agent in your deck, and primarily Venus. **RUN 2**

- **The Agent of Creation - Venus**: She summons Shine Balls at the cost of 500 lifepoints per. This starts the plays, and makes the deck run. She is part of the OTK. **RUN 3**

- **Mystical Shine Ball**: Vanilla and bad, but needed and integral for the deck. Drawing these isn't ideal, but you can always play around it! **RUN 3**

*1.1.2 The Darks*

- **Tour Guide from the Underworld**: Searches out the soon to be banned Sangan, so now we adjust to search out another copy of itself for that instant rank 3 XYZ. **RUN 2**

- **Tragoedia**: Sometimes you need someone to save your ass, and he is just too damn cute to not do it. Great way to save yourself from extra damage, and lifepoints are everything for this deck. **RUN 2**

- **Gorz the Emissary of Darkness**: The former bane of attacking an open field, he does too much too easily to not run. Free 2700 beater, can win you games or turn games to your favor immediately. **RUN 1**

*1.1.3 The Hand Traps*

- **Effect Veiler**: Stops and ruins your day. Sorry opponent. Negate all those effects, and have a glorious day going off yourself. Also, a tuner! **RUN 1-3, preferably 2**

- **Herald of Orange Light**: Effect Veiler on crack, but with a heavier cost. Can also negate effects that activate in the grave, which is a plus over Veiler. **RUN 1-2**

- **Honest**: Nothing is quite as delicious as using a Honest on a Shine Ball to run over their boss monster. It's a special kind of middle finger to your opponent. **RUN 1**

*1.1.4 The Anti-Meta*

- **Thunder King Rai-Oh**: 1900 beater that doubles as a solemn warning without paying 2000 lifepoints? Sounds perfect for us. In a deck with so many weak monsters, Thunder King is a refreshing change of pace, and adds a lot of defensiveness/offensiveness to this deck. **RUN 2**

*1.1.5 The Chaos*

- **Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning**: If you need an explanation, this isn't the deck for you. **RUN 1**

- **Chaos Sorcerer**: Budget friendly BLS. **RUN 1**

*1.1.6 The Techs*

- **D.D. Crow**: Another hand-trap that I personally believe will be favored over Maxx ""C"" this format due to less swarming decks (with the death of wind-ups). Plus it's another easy dark to pitch. **RUN 0-2**

- **Maxx ""C""**: Used to be considered an essential monster, but with the upcoming meta, it might not be guaranteed a spot in the deck. **RUN 0-2**

- **Tour Bus from the Underworld**: Tour Guide ammo. More inconsistent than Sangan, but in this deck it has a lot of versatility. Recycling anything, even a Shine Ball, can open so many more plays for the deck. **RUN 0-1**

- **Night Assailant**: Tour Guide ammo. Set and pop or get it with Tour Guide. Pretty standard tech for those who feel like he is needed. Doesn't add much, sometimes a dead draw. **RUN 0-1**

- **Spirit Reaper**: Sometimes you need defense and our dark discarding buddy over here is a good target for exactly that. Being level 3 allows him for easy XYZ'ing in the deck. **RUN 0-2**

- **Marshmallon**: Sometimes you need defense and our light burn-damage buddy here is a good target for exactly that. His effect can be negated by Dino-Rabbit, so be careful. **RUN 0-1**

- **Genex Ally Birdman**: Level 3 tuner, he is also easy to summon and has his own OTK in this deck. Can be a dead draw. **RUN 0-1**

- **Archlord Kristya** Great card, if you can get it out. Sometimes it's just too difficult and can be the worst dead draw. Getting it out means that the game is going to be heavily in your favor! **RUN 0-1**

__________________________________________________________

**1.2 The Spells!**

*1.2.1 The Staples! - no explanation needed*

- **Dark Hole**: **RUN 1**

- **Monster Reborn**: **RUN 1**

- **Heavy Storm**: **RUN 1**

- **Mystical Space Typhoon**: **RUN 2-3**

*1.2.2 The necessary*

- **Mind Control**: This card lets you take a monster which cannot be tributed or attack this turn. Fine for us, use it to get around a pesky monster, or to XYZ with one of their monsters! **RUN 1**

- **Forbidden Lance**: Just one of those great middle fingers we seems to be giving to our opponent. We all know what it does. The common sells for $17 so this might just be the card of the format. **RUN 2**

*1.2.3 The Techs*

- **Creature Swap**: Make those dead cards slightly more alive with this. Give them a shine ball for their boss monster. Great card, very awesome to have when the shine ball just sits in your hand. **RUN 0-2**

- **Enemy Controller**: A quickplay version of Mind Control with a slight cost, but with the benefit of being able to tribute and attack with the monster. **RUN 0-1**

__________________________________________________________

**1.3 The Traps!**

- This is a really easy section because there are no required traps. Chaos Decks often run no backrow because they are slow draws. You always want to run, and this kinda makes you walk.

*1.3.1 The techs!*

- **Treacherous Trap Hole**: Pop two monsters, because 2 is better than 1. Cannot have any other traps in this deck. **RUN 0-1, and only run it if it's the only trap in the deck**

- **Compulsory Evacuation Device**: Great this, and every other format that XYZ will be dominant. Remarkably chainable so worthwile to look at. Makes MST still dead for the opponent's. **RUN 0-2**

- **Threatening Roar**: A better version of Waboku, protects you're little guys from destruction and you from damage. Extremely chainable so worthwhile to look at. **RUN 0-2**

__________________________________________________________

**1.4 Extra Deck**

*1.4.1 Synchros!*

*As a note, you essentially need just 1 level: 4,5,6,7,8 synchro monster.

- **Armory Arm**: Best level 4

- **Catastor**: Best level 5

- **Iron Chain Dragon/Gaia Knight, the Force of Earth**: Pick one and run one as your level 6

- **Black Rose Dragon**: Best level 7

- **Stardust Dragon**: Best option for level 8, part of the OTK.

*1.4.2 The XYZ*

- **Hieratic Sun Dragon Overlord of Heliopolis**: Great rank 8 XYZ, makes a lot of plays in this deck when you steal your opponent's monster and xyz over it.

- **Any Rank 4**: A couple of options include: **Gem-Knight Pearl**, **Maestroke**, **Gagaga Cowboy**, **Blackship of Corn**

- **Leviathan Dragon**: Staple rank 3.

- **Wind-Up Zenmaines**: Staple Rank 3.

- **Acid Golem of Destruction**: Great for the finishing blow.

- **Leviair the Sea Dragon**: Crucial for an OTK, plus all the banishing.

- **Temtempo**: Staple rank 3.

- **Daigusto Phoenix**: So amazing in this deck, part of the OTK.

- **Dark Mist**: Wins you games!

- **Gachi Gachi**: Staple rank 2.

__________________________________________________________

**2.0 How the deck plays**

*However you want! It has so many options depending on the techs. It can quickly spam out aggressively. It can adapt really well to your opponent's deck. The main point though is to win quickly, with 2 different OTK's (relying on many of the same cards). Use Daigusto to do a quick 3k, use Dark Mist to get over the tough big guys. Creature swap the shine balls again. Basically, you play per turn, and adapt for the next turn. This is one of the decks that really depends on the player, which is why great players like Simon He have done so well with it.

__________________________________________________________

**3.0 The OTKS!!!!!!**

Hand 1: *Venus*, *Hyperion*, *Tour Guide* - OTK

* Summon Tour Guide, go into Tour Guide, XYZ into **Leviair** (no one ever negates this summon because there are no banished monsters. People are normally confused as to whats going on)
* Banish Venus, SS Hyperion.
* Detach from Leviair, SS banished Venus.
* Venus effect twice for two Shine Balls into Daigusto Phoenix. 
* Daigusto Phoenix detach to let **Leviair** attack twice.
* *Optional* Hyperion can use detached Shine Ball to pop a card if needed
* Daigusto (1500), Leviair (1800 x 2), Hyperion (2700), Venus (1600): *Total* = **9400**

Hand 2: *Venus*, *Genex Ally Birdman*, *Hyperion* - OTK

* Summon Venus, SS three Shine Balls
* Bounce one Shine Ball for Birdman
* Use Venus again to SS the bounced Shine Ball from your hand.
* Birdman, Venus, a Shine Ball into Stardust Dragon
* Two Shine Balls remaining into Daigusto Phoenix
* Banish Venus from Graveyard for Hyperion
* Detach from Daigusto Phoenix so **Stardust** can attack twice
* *Optional* Use Hyperions effect to pop, if need be.
* Daigusto (1500), Stardust (2500 x 2), Hyperion (2700): *TOTAL* = **9200**",,False,self,t5_2rpe6,1362029975.0,,light,True,t3_19a8nc,http://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/comments/19a8nc/chaos_agents_a_guide/,

**What cards should I put in my binder?**

1. Find *all* of the holographic cards in your collection. Those will go into your binder.

2. Find out the more expensive cards from the rares and commons left.  An example would be common **Forbidden Lance**.

3. Find all the staples from the rest of the cards - common **Mirror Forces**, rare **Bottomless Trap Holes**, common **Mystical Space Typhoons**, etc., etc..

4. From the rest, find cards that are sought after in the meta - examples include *Harpie* support, **Nin-Ken Dog**, **Kabazauls**, **Sabersaurus**, etc.

**How should I arrange my binder?**  
People arrange their binder in different ways; this is how I arrange my binder.

1. Xyz cards in the front of the binder. I arrange them by the set that they came out in, from GENF to CBLZ then JUMP promos.

2. Synchros come next. I just put them in any which way.

3. Next is all my fusion cards. I put them in any which way.

4. After the fusion cards I put all the holographic, sought after monster cards. **Jurrac Guaibas**, **Rescue Rabbits**, **Maxx Cs**, **Fire Fist Dragon**.

5. After those I put in all my holographic effect monsters. I ordered them from ultimate to secret to ultra then super. 

6. After all the monsters in my binder have been entered I put in my spells and traps. I put spells first, then traps. No real reason for that.

That is how I put together my binder. I have seen many ways, and users can comment how they arrange their binder.

**How do I put my binder on Reddit?**

1. Upload your binder to Imgur and make an album for it. It is easy to arrange pictures, rotate pictures, and generally use Imgur.

2. Make a Binder Post on our subreddit. In that post you want to link to your binder, list your wants (cards you want or are looking for), and maybe make a corny joke in the title to get people to look.

**How do I make a trade?**

1. Find something that you like in someone else's binder. For this example let it be a secret rare, unlimited edition **Rescue Rabbit**. 

2. Comment on his/her post, or message him/her saying you are interested in the **Rescue Rabbit**. Also, in this comment or message make sure to link to your binder. 

3. The person usually finds something they like in your binder. For the sake of this example, let it be a common **Forbidden Lance**. They message or comment back saying that they like your **Forbidden Lance**.

4. The two cards have about equal value (I will explain value in the next section). Since they have equal value, you can commence the next part of the trade.

5. Personal Message the person to go over the last details of the trade. Usually it is ""My **Forbidden Lance** for your **Rescue Rabbit**."" They respond back, agreeing. 

6. Trade address information.

7. Optional but encouraged - Request a confirmation picture to make sure the person isn't a scammer and actually has the card. If requested, it has the person's Username written on a piece of paper, the date written on that piece of paper, and the card laying on that same piece of paper.

8. The person with lower trade feedback will send first, or both people will send at the same time. NOTE: Check if the person has negative feedback. Find out why, and maybe message a prominent user here asking if the prospective trader is reliable.

9. After receiving your trade, post trade feedback. You will post it [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/comments/11v33v/trade_feedback_3_1_year_of_feedback/) and can view it [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/wiki/feedback). You can also find both of these links in the sidebar.

**How do I value my cards?**

1. What is generally used on this subreddit is the lowest Ebay Buy-It-Now price. It is useful because it responds quickest to changes in the meta so the price usually accurately reflects the value of the card. In my example, the lowest eBay BIN for a secret rare **Rescue Rabbit** was $16.50 at the time of this post, and the lowest eBay BIN for a common **Forbidden Lance** was $16.75 at the time of this post. 

2. If you use some other form of valuing you will generally not get a lot of trades. Examples of bad sources include TrollandToad, ""vendor prices,"" and ""locals prices.""

**How should I send my cards?**

1. Put that card or cards into a sleeve.

2. Put that sleeve into a toploader. Other less used forms include two pieces of paperboard or many layers of paper. Try to use a toploader if possible.

3. Put that toploader into an envelope. If the trade is high-value, or you want to feel like a high-roller, you can use a bubble-mailer.

4. Address the envelope or bubble mailer.

5. Put on the right amount of stamps. You can find this using a handy-dandy [postage calculator.](http://postcalc.usps.com/).

**How do I know if someone is scamming me?**

1. Read the [sidebar post](http://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/comments/15xhk6/ive_been_scammed_what_do_i_do/).

That about sums it up. If any of you need help trading, or have questions, you can PM me or comment on this post. I have been trading for a while on here and think I know the ropes. Also, all the cards mentioned in this post I have in my collection and am trading.

Thanks /r/yugioh!

/u/GethPrime MADE THE NEXT PORTION TELLING YOU HOW TO SEND CARDS

&gt;Hi All,
&gt;
&gt;Propagation of a particularly poor packaging practice has prompted me to pen this passionate picture essay.
&gt;
&gt;It is important to size your container to match your package. Any leftover space must be filled. This applies to packages large and small, including those in envelopes, which I will address here. If care is not taken, you may end up with something like [this](http://i.imgur.com/niIuDw7.jpg).
&gt;
&gt;Sleeves and a toploader provide basically all the protection cards need. **In most cases they are only vulnerable to damage or being lost if the envelope tears.** Since the toploader provides rigidity, the closer the size of the envelope to the toploader, the safer the cards will be. **Do not send cards in large envelopes that are more prone to tear. Use small security envelopes.** They are extremely inexpensive and also conceal cash and checks. [Left good, right bad.](http://i.imgur.com/K1WUggO.jpg)
&gt;
&gt;We're not safe yet! There's another bad habit. Tightly wrapping the toploader in a [shell of paper](http://i.imgur.com/rZ5PZra.jpg) only increases the chance of tearing. We don't need paper to protect the cards, we need paper to protect the envelope. **Wrap the toploader in 1-2 sheets of paper (depending on the thickness) [such that it fills the envelope](http://i.imgur.com/i9Oxgqp.jpg)**. This will provide enough rigidity so that it won't flop all over the place and tear. Friction will prevent excessive movement.
&gt;
&gt;Last but not least, it's a good idea to [reinforce with tape](http://i.imgur.com/UOHjYIB.jpg).
&gt;
&gt;Please take care to package cards correctly. They may not be yours anymore, but they will be your problem if they don't arrive safely!
&gt;
&gt;ONE MORE THING...[rant] About extra cards. Everyone started throwing in extra cards, but it's a thinly-veiled attempt to get the icon on the feedback page and dump commons. If you want to be generous and give extra cards, please send something useful. I have enough useless commons of my own to deal with, I don't need yours. Nobody likes junk mail.

We have been in business for 22 years, and have served over 250,000 customers during that time.  We have been online for about 15 years, first as mikeloda.safeshopper.com and then yugiohmint.com.  We have perfect 100% seller ratings on ebay, yahoo and amazon under the user name mikeloda.  We also operate websites hiddenarsenal.com, mikeloda.com, photonshockwave.com, generationforce.com, yugiohgold.com and many more.

For those that do not know about our website yugiohmint.com , we are one of the only companies that sell trully uncirculated mint yu-gi-oh, vanguard and other cards, taken straight from the packs we open and put into sleeves.  We are also one of the few companies that give you free sleeves with the cards we sell.  

Some ask why we charge so much for shipping, but we really don't if you look at it.  We strive to ship your cards out same day as you place your order. We actually pack our cards in a secure bubble pack or box for superior protection, we sleeve the cards to keep them fresh mint condition for double protection, and we sandwich them between 2 hard plastic premium top loaders for triple protection.  You will see quality control checks from at least three quality control employees that screen out any manufacturing defects found and make sure you have the correct cards.  

Your package is then insured and given tracking.  We do all this because we are protecting your investment of uncirculated mint condition cards.  If you buy used, played, ""near mint"" cards from other places, you obviously do not need much protection to protect something of a lower value than what we provide.  Also, if your cards get lost or stolen in the mail, we pay alot of money to insure your cards, so you can get replacements.  

We really shine when you pay about $10 for 100 cards since the shipping cost is the same as one card, and if you have a shopping cart total of $100.00 and use the coupon code 7pct1 to get 7% off or $7 on $100.00, then our factored shipping price is usually lower than our competition, sometimes better than free shipping, and you are getting pristine uncirculated mint cards for less than the price of used cards.  

We partner with companies such as duelingnetwork.com and offer additional specials exclusive to their website to promote the game and make your online experience a pleasant one.  You may want to check out their website.

We are doing our best, constantly stocking new cards as fast as we can, and we have put up nearly 400 cards that were out of stock on our website just recently.  Our automated email system allows you to let us know the cards you want, and we email you back when they are in stock.

Thanks for reading, we appreciate your business, and look forward to your order, as always.  Thanks again, and have a Fantastic Day!

Hi /r/yugioh! With the next format looming, I'd like for some community input on one of the most consistently useful side-deck cards: Prohibition (and it's close friend, Psi-Blocker).

&gt;**Prohibition**  
*Continuous Spell Card*  
Activate by declaring 1 card name. Cards with that name, and their effects, cannot be used. Cards already on the field are not affected (including face-down cards).

&gt;**Psi-Blocker**  
*Psychic/Effect*  
Once per turn: You can declare 1 card name; cards with that name, and their effects, cannot be used until the End of your opponent's next turn.

*What specifically does* **Prohibition/Psi-Blocker** *stop?*

About two months ago, /u/DecadeDuelist posted a ""Prohibition List"" [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/comments/1fwoq8/the_prohibition_list/). Please visit that link for more information, I don't want to make this post too long.

---
Clearly, this card and it's cousin, **Psi-Blocker**, can easily lock out your opponent's power cards or stop them from using cards like **Mystical Space Typhoon** to destroy your side-decked cards. However, it's not always clear what to call with **Prohibition**, especially if you're not very familiar with many decks.

1373779448.0,54,self.yugioh,1i9fg9,Remember my Scammed Dracossack? I got it back (Update/Story Inside),66,12,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/comments/1i9fg9/remember_my_scammed_dracossack_i_got_it_back/,"Edit: [Here's](http://imgur.com/D0DQJua.jpg) a picture of it back home!

So to start this off, I'm going to not mention any names of anyone specific in this post. I feel that calling this person out at this point is useless because:  
  
A) I got my stuff back already, and  
B) He hasn't touched his account in a month. 
  
But alas, here's my story.  
  
Some time ago, when Draco was still at around 180, I agreed to trade my dracossack for his $160 concealed cash *(MISTAKE #1)* , d prison, maestroke, and redox. The trade was happening right before his regional that he wanted to play d-rulers in. Because of this, he stressed that I send out the card first, due to the timing and him having more rep *(MISTAKE #2)* . I got blinded by the great deal I was getting and agreed to this. Waited a week and on the day of his regional he got back to me letting me know he received my end, and would send his end out **soon** .  
  
Little did I know what **soon** really meant.  
  
A week passed without a message from him confirming a shipment, so I shot him a message asking what was up. He said he had sent his end out, and that I should wait a few more days and get back to him after that. I wait another week, still nothing, so I send him a message asking whatsup. He says he's on vacation for 2 weeks, but if its not there after that, then he'll repay me via paypal *(NOTE: he couldn't paypal the money before, remember, he could only do concealed cash. How come he can paypal now?)* I tensely say okay and wait TWO MORE WEEKS.  
  
Fast forward to the day he supposedly gets back from vacation. I shoot him a message about not getting his end yet, no response. I shoot another message 3 days later, still no response. Finally, after another week of no responses, I accept the fact that I got scammed.  
  
Naturally, I make a post on this subreddit about the user, hoping to avoid this mess happening to another unlucky individual. Apparently, according to the thread, I wasn't the only one he scammed. He scammed someone out of a full mermail deck I believe, and some other watts/prophecy cards as well. I think about 2 or 3 other people got scammed around the same time as well.  
  
What I think he did was build his rep just enough to have others send first (his rep was 15), and then do a lot of high value trades at the same time.  
  
But anyways, I made the thread explaining everything that had happened so far, and a few people gave me some advice.  
  
*""Dude, call the police. that's straight up mail fraud.""*  
  
At this point I had tried contacting him via ""@""ing him on twitter (he's linked it on here before""), commenting on his instagram (linked to twitter), and messaging him on here, all with no responses and being blocked on twitter/instagram. I even tried looking up his last name on whitepages to get a phone number to call, but the number I found wasn't working. So at this point, I figured trying the police couldn't hurt.  
  
I called my local police and spoke with the investigator. I explained the entire story, how he agreed to the trade, confirmed receiving his end, and abandoning my messages after that. He said if I could print out the messages and bring them to him, he could see what he could do. A few hours after that conversation, an anonymous user on this reddit said they knew the scammer IRL, and gave me his phone number, on the condition that his identity remain anonymous. I then passed this information to the investigator.  
  
About a week and a half later, I get a call back from the investigator. We talk, and here's what basically went down:  
  
The investigator asked the scammer about the trade, scammer said he was *still* on vacation. Investigator said that basically he can cooperate and send either his end of the deal or my card back, or he can send the local police to his home to arrest him for mail fraud and theft. Apparently the scammer tried to argue for a bit but ended up agreeing to sending my card back. He sent the card that night, and called the investigator to confirm this.  
  
Tonight, I got the card back. After this wild rough journey, it's finally come home.  
  
Now, I didn't want to post ANY of this until I knew the final outcome of the situation, because if it didn't work I didn't want to convince other redditors to approach their scammers this way and get dissapointed.  
  
Here's what I've learned from all this, and what I suggest YOU do if you've been scammed by this person or someone else:  
  
First, I won't be doing ANY more concealed cash trades. The officer brought up a good point: yes, you pay a small fee with paypal, but having that security is MUCH safer and easier to deal with than the whole concealed cash deal. It's not even about the money being stolen, but rather it being so easy to just *not send it*.  
  
Second, I wouldn't do any trades higher than you're normally comfortable with (for me, I'm going to set my limit at $30). I don't care if its the best deal ever, I don't think risking $30+ worth of cards is worth it. Its VERY easy to scam people, whether its through a trade on here, or through an ad on craigslist, these ""uninsured"" trades can be very risky.  
  
Third, IF you've been scammed, call your local police/investigator! I asked the investigator who helped me what I should tell other people scammed by this person or anyone in general, and he said this, ""Give the officer as much honest, raw information as you can. Names, phone numbers, house numbers, print outs of the messages you sent back and forth, anything that can pin a crime on the scammer can help. These uninsured trades done through social networks like facebook and craigslist are very hard to deal with, since there is no contract or person forcing someone to give you their end of the deal.""  
  
IF you commented on my last thread and believe you have been scammed by the same person that scammed me, PLEASE PM me, I'd be glad to provide information to help you out/answer questions, but I will not be posting anything publicly, sorry. This is to protect the person and myself, legally.  
  
I've learned a lot from this, and am almost glad it happened. I will be a lot more careful with my cards, my money, and my valuables from now on, and I hope you are too.  
  
If anyone has any questions, feel free to ask away, thanks for reading!

You might see some variation, like the exclusion or inclusion of a colon, but for the most part these are the four ways that effects can activate. Now, using what we just learned, which of these effect(s) are able to miss the timing?  
  
[Answer](/s ""**Botanical Girl**"")  
  
**Botanical Girl** is the right answer since she has a ""**When...You can...**"" effect. Seriously, all you need to remember is that an effect can ""**Miss the Timing**"" if and only if it is a ""**When...You can...**"" effect. Simple enough, right? Now that you know how to spot effects that can ""**Miss the Timing**"", I'll go into the specifics about why this happens. 
***  
So you are know probably wondering why this occurs the way that it does, and the answer more so has to deal with the literal implications of these words. The phrase ""**When...You can...**"" suggests that the effect must occur at the time when a specific condition is met (**When...**) and the also that the actual activation of the effect is optional (**You can...**). When these two factors are put together, this allows a card to literally ""**Miss its Timing**"" of activation if it is not the last thing to occur.     
  
Tributing [**Botanical Girl**](http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20081101212224/yugioh/images/6/6a/BotanicalGirlCSOC-EN-C-1E.png) in order to summon 
   [**Jinzo**](http://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120530134561/yugioh/images/d/d2/Jinzo-BP01-EN-SFR-1E.png) means that the summon of [**Jinzo**](http://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120530134561/yugioh/images/d/d2/Jinzo-BP01-EN-SFR-1E.png) is going to occur when we would **need** to activate the effect of [**Botanical Girl**](http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20081101212224/yugioh/images/6/6a/BotanicalGirlCSOC-EN-C-1E.png). Then, since [**Botanical Girl**](http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20081101212224/yugioh/images/6/6a/BotanicalGirlCSOC-EN-C-1E.png) isn't a mandatory effect it just fizzles out, never activating.   
 
In contrast, if we were to tribute [**Sangan**](http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20121005003643/yugioh/images/f/fb/Sangan-LCYW-EN-ScR-1E.jpg) under these same circumstances, the effect will resolve. Even though it starts out as a ""**When...**"" effect, the actual activation is **not optional** and as such **must** activate if the conditions are met, no matter what. It will just do so in a separate chain than of [**Jinzo**](http://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120530134561/yugioh/images/d/d2/Jinzo-BP01-EN-SFR-1E.png)'s summon. **Non-optional effects MUST if their requirements TO actiavte are fulfilled.** If the card isn't phrased as a ""**When...You can...**"" effect it is impossible to ""**Miss the Timing**"". 
***  
###S.E.G.O.C.  
This is an acronym for the phrase: ""**Simultaneous Effects Go On Chain**""    
  
This is probably one of the most confusing parts about determining whether or not a card will ""**Miss its Timing**"". You should remember that only ""**When...You can...**"" effects are capable of ""**Missing their Timing**"", but there is still some confusion on what will actually cause these effects to ""**Miss their Timing**"".    
  
**SEGOC** is saying that if two effects want to activate at the same time, even if they are optional, they go on a chain link rather than fizzling out. Only a mandatory effects that does not start a chain (like the summoning of a monster or second part to an effect) can cause a card to ""**Miss Timing**"". Simultaneous effects form chains according to this order:  
  
1. Turn Player's Mandatory Effects
2. Non-Turn Player's Mandatory Effects
3. Turn Player's Optional Effects
4. Non-Turn Player's Optional Effects  
  
The chain then resolves as usual.  
  
**Example:**  
  
 The Turn Player controls [**Sangan**](http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20121005003643/yugioh/images/f/fb/Sangan-LCYW-EN-ScR-1E.jpg) and [**Botanical Girl**](http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20081101212224/yugioh/images/6/6a/BotanicalGirlCSOC-EN-C-1E.png). The non-Turn Player controls [**Sangan**](http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20121005003643/yugioh/images/f/fb/Sangan-LCYW-EN-ScR-1E.jpg) and [**Botanical Girl**](http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20081101212224/yugioh/images/6/6a/BotanicalGirlCSOC-EN-C-1E.png). If the Turn Player activates [**Dark Hole**](http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20121006004746/yugioh/images/d/d8/DarkHole-LCYW-EN-ScR-1E.png), then all four monsters' effects activate at the same time.  
&gt;
&gt;* The Turn Player's only mandatory effects is that of his **Sangan**, so the effect of his **Sangan** becomes Chain Link 1.  
&gt;
&gt;* The non-Turn Player's only mandatory effect is that of his **Sangan**, so the effect of his **Sangan** becomes Chain Link 2.  
&gt;
&gt;* The Turn Player's only optional effects is that of his **Botanical Girl**, so the effect of his **Botanical Girl** becomes Chain Link 3.  
&gt;
&gt;* The non-Turn Player's only optional effects is that of his **Botanical Girl**, so the effect of his **Botanical Girl** becomes Chain Link 4.  

Afterwards, players can add more cards to the Chain normally which will then resolve backwards as usual.  
  
Now this may seem pretty simple, but it gets more complex when you have to decide what situations/effects are able to start a chain and what situations/effects are unable to start a chain. Like why doesn't the summon of   [**Jinzo**](http://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120530134561/yugioh/images/d/d2/Jinzo-BP01-EN-SFR-1E.png) go on a chain with the effect of  [**Botanical Girl**](http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20081101212224/yugioh/images/6/6a/BotanicalGirlCSOC-EN-C-1E.png) since they are happening simultaneously? The answer to this is that **the summon of** [**Jinzo**](http://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120530134561/yugioh/images/d/d2/Jinzo-BP01-EN-SFR-1E.png) **does not start a chain and as such may not be placed on a chain**. This same logic goes into cards like [**Soul Taker**](http://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20121011221659/yugioh/images/6/6d/SoulTaker-LCYW-EN-C-1E.jpg). If you did not know, [**Soul Taker**](http://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20121011221659/yugioh/images/6/6d/SoulTaker-LCYW-EN-C-1E.jpg) will make cards miss their timing.   
  
**Example:**  
  
The turn player has no monsters on the field and a [**Soul Taker**](http://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20121011221659/yugioh/images/6/6d/SoulTaker-LCYW-EN-C-1E.jpg) in their hand. The non-turn player controls [**Botanical Girl**](http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20081101212224/yugioh/images/6/6a/BotanicalGirlCSOC-EN-C-1E.png).  
  
&gt;* Turn player activates **Soul Taker** targeting the opponent's **Botanical Girl**.  
&gt;  
&gt;*    The second effect of **Soul Taker** kicks in at the same time the effect of **Botanical Girl** would need to activate, and since  the second effect of **Soul Taker** does not start a chain, it may not start a chain with **Botanical Girl**. 
&gt;  
&gt;* **Botanical Girl** ""**Misses the Timing**"" while the non-turn player gains a mandatory 1000 Life Points. 
   
As you can see, since the effect that occurred simultaneously with [**Botanical Girl**](http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20081101212224/yugioh/images/6/6a/BotanicalGirlCSOC-EN-C-1E.png) was unable to go on a chain, [**Botanical Girl**](http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20081101212224/yugioh/images/6/6a/BotanicalGirlCSOC-EN-C-1E.png)'s effect was not able to activate.

Thanks for Reading! I hope you learned something new about what ""**Missing the Timing**"" actually means and how to deal with effects that do ""**Miss the Timing**"".

I made this a little while back for my personal use, but threw it up on the play store for free to see if people would also find it useful. It started out kind of buggy so it got some bad reviews, but now that I've got it all worked out, people really seem to like it.

It has an auto-complete text box for you to enter the name of the card you want to search for (note: you don't have to use one of the suggested names if it's not working or what you want isn't there). You can also check/uncheck the Rarity boxes to get what you want. The second box is for you to add terms like Set ID or other rarities not listed.

The app performs an eBay search that only returns SOLD listings, not active or unsold, so you're getting the best possible results. But if the results do seem off, you can click a link at the bottom and it will pull up the search in your own browser to see what results the app saw. Note: the eBay mobile site doesn't allow to search by only sold listings, so if your user agent can be changed to Desktop, that will help you to see exactly the results that the app got.

Anyways, it's free, so please check it out and if you have feedback, I'd love to hear it. Thanks!

1362254098.0,50,self.yugioh,19jc52,A Guide to Effectively using Backrow,61,11,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/comments/19jc52/a_guide_to_effectively_using_backrow/,"As this guide was intended to be written for [here](http://www.neoseeker.com/forums/40362/t1836845-guide-to-effective-use-of-backrow/), formatting on here may not work as well.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

**What is Backrow?**

Backrow is the array of set cards on your spell/trap zone, or literally the ""backrow"" of your field. Generally, when referring to backrow, it is used to refer to Spell/Traps used to protect the player from threats. 
A subset of backrow, sometimes referred to as ""stun backrow"", are highly disruptive traps that completely deny your opponent their play. Generally, these traps are the backbone of standard competitive trap lineups, particularly due to how effective they are. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
  
**Card Advantage Theory**

As Card Advantage is a highly comprehensive topic that would require its own guide in order to explain, I'll only describe the fundamental concepts and terms and how they tie into the use of backrow. 

I highly suggest you learn more about Card Advantage, as it plays an immensely large role in determining the flow of the game. Additionally, almost the entirety of ideas and information in this guide is derived from this theory. Even if you are familiar with the concepts of Card Advantage, I don't suggest skipping this section, as it offers a relatively indepth explanation on how this ties into effective uses of backrow. 
  
**What is Card Advantage?**

So what is the Card Advantage Theory? Card advantage is, as its name suggests, based around the idea that having more available cards gives the player a considerable advantage. As with many other games, simply having more resources than your opponent grants you a considerable advantage. For some odd reason, many novice players fail to realize that cards are resources, and that outresourcing your opponent grants you considerable advantage. 
  
**Types of Card Advantage**

Advantage in the minds of Yu-Gi-Oh players is how many more cards you control than your opponent. However, a mistake made by most novices is counting cards in graveyard, or banished, or who knows where. Although you could make some arbitrary system for those, the general consensus is that there are three types of Advantage calculated: Field Advantage, Hand Advantage and overall Advantage. As their names suggest, Field Advantage counts the number of cards on the field, hand advantage counts the number of cards in hand, and overall Advantage is the number of cards overall. 

Another common mistake of novices is to disregard Hand Advantage, and focus completely on field advantage. Both are considerably important, and, a lot of the times, Hand Advantage is actually considered more important. Yu-Gi-Oh is a game with lots of mass-destruction cards that turn the game's flow around at the drop of a hat. However, generally, these mass-destruction cards do not affect the hand. As such, the hand is generally a safe haven for cards to remain to be used later on as responses to your opponent's plays. This idea of the hand being a safe haven will be explained in detail later on. 
  
**Calculation of Advantage via Plusses and Minuses**

This simple theory is further expanded into a system of plusses and minuses, which is definitely very similar to the Revere Plus-Minus System used for card counting in blackjack. 
These ""Plusses"" and ""Minuses"" will constantly be mentioned in this guide, as they play a large role in deciding what to use and not use. They will also be written in the notation of ""+N"" and ""-N"", where N is a number. Both plusses and minuses have a fairly self-explanatory name: they are the gains and losses (or plusses and minuses) from a play. For calculating the plusses and minuses of the card, the Overall Advantage is used, with the difference of how many more cards you had than your opponent before and after the card is played being the number used in the aforementioned notation. For example, playing ""Pot of Greed"" is a +1, as I lose one card, Pot of Greed itself, in order to draw two more cards, for a net gain of 1. 

To novice players uninitiated with the impact of this concept, the idea of plusses and minuses may seem trivial. Why would you not use a card just because it gives your opponent only one more card than you? And how does this apply to backrow? The next section should (hopefully) explain it.
  
**Simplification and One-For-One Exchanges**

I think many players have previously been in a game where one side has no hand nor field, and are frantically striving to call upon ""the heart of the cards"" while the other side is in a dominating position with a solid setup. Unsurprisingly, the controlling side of this stage of the game is the ideal position to be in, as winning is almost guaranteed. 

Along with being walls for defense, the use of Backrow is to simplify the game with one-for-one (or +0) card exchanges while one has more cards than the opponent, until the opponent runs out of cards. As such, there is no reason to use defensive backrow that doesn't also contribute to this purpose of simplification. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
  
**Playing**

With the general Theory-Oh! done, and those vague concepts and mindsets described, we can now continue on to the heart of this guide: backrow itself. Knowing how simplification works is no good if the player can't correctly control the flow of the game by using backrow in an effective manner. Many intermediate players and even advanced players suffer from this issue. 
 
**The Protection and Conservation of Backrow**

Many times, I hear players complaining about ""lucksacks"" to argue that they lost due to pure luck. Of course, there are some cases where the opponent legitimately got lucky and there was nothing that could be done about it. However, many times, the opponent is granted an avenue to ""sack"" by the player's wasteful use of backrow, causing them to not have a response to their opponent when it really matters. 
In order to reduce the waste of backrow, here are some simple guidelines to be established: 

**Don't stop trivial things if you can deal with it later on without using a trap:** 
In one of our games, my opponent opened with one set card. I simply normal summoned a Wind-Up Shark merely to poke for a measily 1500 damage. Judging by his plays the next turn, he had plenty of cards that could've dealt with my simple 1500 monster. However, he had a knee-jerk reaction and flipped his set trap card, wasting it in order to avoid a simple 1500 damage. Evidently, that was the only trap available for him, as he had no way of defending himself from my offensive push later in the game. 

**Be a man, let yourself take damage:** 
A common mindset amoung new players is that difference in life point matters enough for the player to do whatever they can to avoid taking damage. This ties into my example above, as wasting backrow to avoid taking a little bit of damage may lose you the game. An additional variation of this is wasting Mirror Force/Dimensional Prison in order to avoid being attacked, even if the life points/monster you wish to defend doesn't play an important role.  

**Avoid setting a large amount of backrow immediately:** 
As previously mentioned, Yu-Gi-Oh! is a game with lots of mass-destruction. A primary example of this is Heavy Storm, a power card that clears backrow. Many times, I see players setting 4 trap cards, only to have it be wiped away by Heavy Storm or some other power card and leaving them without a hand. Of course, Starlight Road is a card that, if played and drawn, allows for an exception to this rule. However, I don't advise bluffing Starlight Road. Many players (especially novices who don't think far ahead) will continue to play Heavy Storm anyways.  

**Negate when the opponent invests, not at the start of the combo:** 
Of course, there are many exceptions to this rule (for example, against Wind-Ups or Hieratics, where you should negate the start in order to not be OTKed). However, negating when your opponent invests multiple cards into one card is an easy way to gain Card Advantage while simplifying the game state. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
**Deck Building**

With perfect playing, you can use the full potential of traps. However, the full potential of traps is bottlenecked by the effects of the trap itself. Knowing which traps are most effective and which ones are decaprecated is an important skill that most beginners haven't quite obtained yet. 
  
**Filtering Decaprecated Backrow**

There are a multitude of criteria for which traps should and should not be used. I may have missed a few of them, but these listed below are important ones: 

**Situationality:** 
""You can only activate this card when it is the 20th of April at 4:20 PM"" is obviously not a very good condition. Of course, no cards are that situational, however, there are many cards which are nearly as situational that novice players still use. Overall, the more general the conditions for the Trap are, the better. For that reason, Solemn Judgment is a popular card despite its hefty cost. 

**Effectiveness:** 
Even if a card meets all of the other criteria, it may still be disregarded for not being useful. Remember that Backrow is used both to protect yourself, to simplify the game state, and to punish your opponent for investing resources by making them minus. If the trap does not help the above goals, it may not be a good idea to use.  

**There are better alternatives:** 
Sakaretsu armor, for example, is a favorite of many a new player. However, it is completely outclassed by both Mirror Force and Dimensional Prison. An additional example is Trap Hole. It is outclassed by both Bottomless Trap Hole and Solemn Warning. Of course, many of these better alternatives are recognized by the general playerbase as better, which makes them a little pricier. Unless you plan on topping major tournaments, or play on DN, you only have to follow this one for as much as your wallet can deal with it.

**Card Advantage:** 
Although some OCG players may disagree with me on this point, traps such as Raigeki Break and Phoenix Wind Blast are not worth using, as they are -1s, which doesn't help with the goal of simplifying the game in your favor. 
  
**Meta Calls**

The most important factor of backrow to use for higher level play is the current direction of the metagame. Some traps may be rendered useless against the current metagame, or may gain a boost in effectiveness. 

A primary example of this are Mirror Force and Dimensional Prison: They were made completely useless and not to be used during the format where Inzektors were a formidable and common matchup. As such, they fell out of favor until the constant threat of Inzektors faded away. 

Discretion is to be made for determining the direction of the metagame, and what to do for it. However, predicting the metagame in itself is a very large topic which, as well as deserving its own guide, is often very abstract. As such, I can't write much about it. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

**Common Choices**

As the card pool of Yu-Gi-Oh! is massive, we will save some time by listing a few common choices for backrow. Please note that this is not a comprehensive list, and that there may be many cards missing from this list. 
 
**Staples:**

* Solemn Judgment 
* Solemn Warning 
* Torrential Tribute 

These cards are mandatory in nearly every deck, as they are incredibly effective at doing what they do. 
 
**Preference cards:**

* Book of Moon 
* Bottomless Trap Hole 
* Compulsory Evacuation Device 
* Dimensional Prison 
* Fiendish Chain 
* Forbidden Lance 
* Mirror Force 

These cards are often used, but which ones used depend on the current metagame and preferences of the player. 
 
**Starlight Road**

This card deserves special mention. It is useful for protecting large trap lineups, and is often used in trap-heavy decks. Whether you use it or not is up to your preference, but generally, only one copy should be used. 
 
**OCG Cards**

* Raigeki Break 
* Phoenix Wind Blast 

Personally, I highly dislike these cards. However, they are commonly used in the OCG, and so deserve to be mentioned.

* Gravekeeper's - Very cheap and works very well against the all monsters meta we are in. You basically just sit behind your traps and constantly go plus with recruiter + Stele + (Wonder Wand)

Cards that can be added: Wonder Wand (x2), Malefic Stardust, TRAPS! This deck relies on shutting your Opponent down with cards like Bottomless, Mirror Force, Solemn Warning, Ect.

Basic Deck Skeleton: http://i.imgur.com/TfTL3vf.png

* Macro Rabbit - Not very cheap if you add Guaibas + Lances. But most of the decks in the meta use the graveyard a lot. Very good against the meta, and has a very good competitiveness to cost ratio.

Cards that can be added: Guaibas + Lances do VERY well and add A LOT to this deck. Also Lv. 4s in the extra deck, Utopia, Maestroke, Shock Master, ECT. 

Basic Deck Skeleton: http://i.imgur.com/l0w8XPG.png

* Chaos Dragons - Again decently cheap but they use BLS and you can play without him you are fine.

What can be taken out: Traps, not that good, as Metallicrooster said.

What can be put in: Solar Recharge, Lumina, BLS. Lv 6s 5s and 4s work well in the extra deck. 

Basic Deck Skeleton: http://i.imgur.com/ewSdO2O.png

* Chaos Agents - Again very cheap can pick of three structure deck for about $25 but then you need things like tour guide, trag, gorz, chaos sorc, BLS (Again can work without, but it helps the deck out tenfold.)  

Basic Deck Skeleton: http://i.imgur.com/AmF3IIV.png

* Six Samurai - I don't really know what to say about this because I have never played them and have no idea of the cost. If anyone can inform me of the cost, and a cheap deck skeleton. It would be very appreciated.

* Dark Worlds: Very cheap, can get three structure decks/trade for most of the cards. 

Dark World Lightning and whatever the other one is that i out in l0l.

* Inzektors: Decently cheap, don't really know much about this deck though.

Basic Deck Skeleton: http://i.imgur.com/PAixw2d.png

* Chain Burn: INSANELY cheapr but you will most likely get flamed for running it.

The deck should look something like this: http://i.imgur.com/14zWT8l.png

* Lancer Frogs: Decently cheap, most cards will be &lt;$5

Basic Deck Skeleton: http://i.imgur.com/8KdAymP.png

* Machina Gadget: Very cheap, and has a structure deck.

Basic Deck Skeleton: http://i.imgur.com/VDZALVz.png

Again I haven't played all of these decks so I don't know if I am missing things and also I am most likely missing a few decks.

I got lazy and stopped putting better and more expensive cards in the side. And cheap cards in extra.

Make sure you grab some tissues first, I know I'll need them.

When I was about 1 year old, my family got a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel puppy named Fergy, and we loved her very much. I grew up with her all through grade school and middle school, and she was always there for me. If I ever had a bad day, I always knew that I had her happy, smiling face to come home to. She was everyone's favorite dog. She was family to us.

About 5 years ago, she started to have some health complications involving her heart (specifically congestive heart failure). She required frequent visits to the vet and had to be put on multiple medications for it. Then, she got better, and was the same, happy, cheerful dog that she always was. Last year, the heart problems came back. The vet said that she didn't have much time left. Her personality never changed though, she continued to fetch for her toy, run up and down the stairs, and hold her ground when she fought with our cat. Then finally, on a December morning, before leaving for school, I went to go wake her up from where she always slept. I called her name, expecting that she would perk up and ask for food. She didn't. She stared at me sullenly, not wanting to move. I took her to the vet with her in my lap. When we got to the vet, they told us there was nothing they could do. When I held her in my arms during her last moments of life, she never cried, and she never wimpered. She stayed strong, just like my parents had taught me all through my childhood that I spent with her by my side. I lost my best friend that day. ""Be like Fergy was,"" is now the motto that we live by in my family. The strength that she showed me during her last moments has driven me to want to succeed and be a better person, whether it be in school, or in Yu-Gi-Oh, or just in life in general.

The other day when I was playing with my friend, I took a look at Madolche Cruffsant, who made a striking resemblance to Fergy. I decided to dedicate the card to her, and make my own alter of it http://imgur.com/X2x2tQ8 to remind me every day when I play, whatever situation that I may be in that would look grim, I can just remember what she did in a similar situation. She never gave up, and she never backed down. She *stayed strong*.

Thank you for reading this, it really means a lot to me and I'm really happy that I got to share something so special to me with you guys. Good luck with all of the dueling and trading that any of you may do in the future, /r/yugioh. And do me a favor, just for Fergy.

Stay strong.

A New Way to Interact with fellow Duelists!,65,12,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/comments/1bk9m1/the_official_ryugioh_gaming_thread_a_new_way_to/,"Starting up now will be an organized way for us to expand what we do as a community. We all love playing children's card games, but for many of us it is far from the only gaming experience we partake in on a regular basis. Many of us are either on Steam or XBL or PSN, or otherwise playing some online games in one form of another. Now this is *your* opportunity to join in with your fellow redditors and not only see what other games we play, but also join in on the fun!

[Here is a public Google Doc that any of you can access from this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AogoKlp9Yk-LdHg1c19ac1JNOFdxdk40ejdWa0U0Nmc#gid=0). 

Exclusively for this community, if you want to you can put your other gaming information here, such as your nicknames and what games you play. In the future, this spreadsheet can be used as a tool to help organize gaming events within the sub. 

This is more of a preliminary post, mostly to gather interest in this, see who is available to play what, and so on. If this gets enough support, perhaps we can host weekly game nights for popular games such as Minecraft or TF2! The possibility of also getting Streams of such events or having non-Yugioh tournaments would also be interesting... but I'm getting ahead of myself!

The point is this: I don't know about you guys, but I would love to play other games with you guys and socialize with you outside of yugioh too, but your help is needed to organize this! Here's what you can do or answer to help get this ball rolling:

* Fill out any information you can/want to on the Google Doc above!
 * Also let me know if I should add any columns of information or anything as such.
* Post here with any questions/comments/ideas you may have!
  * What kind of games would you like to play? What games *can* you play?
  * When would be an optimal time for game nights for you? How would you like to see these organized, and for what consoles?
  * I'm not a PC Gamer, so anything to do with TF2, PC Minecraft Servers, WoW, LoL, Starcraft, or anything as such someone else would have to help out with; post here if you can and are willing!
  * Same thing with PSN! I'm almost exclusively on Xbox.
* Upvote to show your support!
 * I don't receive any karma for this, so your upvotes go exclusively to spreading the word about a new way to both expand and connect out community!

In the future, I'll flesh out such gaming posts as needed, so sorry if this seems sparse to start!

Here's the opportunity to make this happen guys! *Let's do it*.

About halfway through the game, I have the clear advantage, I have Evilswarm Ophion, Sangan, and Tour Guide, plus a Torrential Tribute and an Infestation Pandemic Infection set. He has two backrow.

His turn, he specials Photon Thrasher, then normals Crusher. (admittedly, this was where I SHOULD have torrential'd, I was planning to chain Infection and get the Sangan eff for the +1, but my inexperience with Photons led me to believe he was going into Utopia or something.)

So he overlays into Photoknight Paladius, which I've never seen, so naturally I say ""hold on"" into the chat. He keeps going, immediately detaching his two materials. I say ""hold on"" again, and he ignores me again, targeting Ophion with his effect. At this point I flip torrential. After about 15 seconds, he goes ""hello effect already activated, too late"".

I tell him that he went way too fast, and that I said hold on and he ignored me, and he goes ""Try thinking on your feet next time"". This is where I call the admin.

The admin doesn't come for at LEAST 10 minutes, during which I try to reason with the guy, which was obviously fruitless. Some gems include ""you could have just hand your finger on your trap ready to activate it"", as if I'm supposed to decide whether or not to activate a trap card  before I even know what monster he's summoning, and my personal favorite: "" there are no manners in yugioh /  and I play by the rules, and I don;t have to ruleshark"".

Later on he pulls the ""I've been playing longer than you kid"" without me making any indication whatsoever of how long I've been playing (7+ years, on and off, by the way), at this point he just starts talking in circles leading me to believe he does this a lot, to take advantage of the lack of admins to get people to quit out of boredom.

The admin finally arrives, lets him talk first, and he says ""I activated Photoknight's effect and he tries to torrential"" (At this point I'm cringing, I didn't know admins could check duel logs). Admin says ""where was the summon?"" ""There was no summon"" and then asks me what happened.

I reiterate my story, and he goes to check the logs. once again, I'm holding my breath. If I wasted 15 minutes of my life for an admin to get the call wrong, you can bet I'd have been mad. Admin comes back and basically sides with me, and then says ""furthermore, because you told us a misleading statement and tried to cheat, you will receive a warning and a game loss"", but it gets better. After a couple minutes of the guy backpedaling the admin comes back and says ""I just found out this was a repeat offense, your warning has been upgraded to a ban, and another offense will result in a permaban"". Player kicked, I win, admin thanks me, the end.

Took quite a bit of time to get the ruling I knew was right, but man was it worth the wait.

Back in the olden days of yugioh, the game was ridiculously popular among little kids. Those little kids grew up to be us (for the most part). Another thing to take into consideration is that kids aren’t always smart. Counterfeit companies like to take advantage of their/our naivety. They print fake cards in attempt to scam you into buying them thinking that you scored with some really rare stuff. In this guide, I’ll show you how to spot a fake like a pro!

__________________

&gt; **Look at the card**

Obvious first step. Most of the time the image of a fake card will be blurry. This is because the quality of the printers is significantly poorer than that of Konami. If you have poor eye-sight then you shouldn't worry. There are a lot of other ways to show that a card's fake.

__________________

&gt; **Check the set number**

All yugioh cards have a set number. This is located below the bottom-right of the image. An example would be Yata-Garasu. Its set number is LOD-000. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/Ks723.png) is where the set number is located. With this number, you can easily look up your card on [Yugioh.wikia.com](http://www.yugioh.wikia.com). If you come across a card that you think is fake, type the number into the wikia and see if it matches what you have. If there is no code on the card then you have yourself a fake! Unfortunately this does not 100% prove that a card is real. So onto the next test!

_______________

&gt;**Check the Font**

Konami has been consistent with the font they use on their cards since the day they began printing them. If you think that a card is fake, you can easily compare it by holding it next to a card that you know is real. If the font looks off, then you have yourself a fake. For some reason, a lot  of fakers just can't get this one right. Be careful though, normal monster's text will always be italicized where as effect monster text is not.

____________________

&gt;**Check the copyright**

On the very bottom-right of the card next to the hologram square that we will get to in a second, you should see ""©1996 KAZUKI TAKAHASHI"". Most, if not all, fakes will not have this at all. Other fakes will misspell Kazuki Takahashi's name. If this is the case, then you have another fake.

_________________

&gt;**Check the hologram square**

Almost every player knows that a fake card does not have this little hologram square in the bottom-right corner of the card. If you hold it up to the light, you should see the Eye of Horus and ""Yu-Gi-Oh"" inside of the hologram. A lot of ""better"" fakes will just put a blank square in this spot. You should also note that this is **NOT A STICKER**. I see a lot of people calling this thing a sticker and those people are wrong. If you do notice that card has this hologram square and it peels of like a sticker, the card is fake. The actual hologram square on a legitimate card is stamped on during printing.

_________________

&gt;**Check the back of the card**

[This](http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20081116222811/ycm/images/archive/e/e5/20091231183527!Back-EN.png) is what you should see. [This](http://images.wikia.com/ycm/images/d/da/Back-JP.png) is what you should see if your card is Japanese. If your card doesn't look like that then it's definitely 100% fake. This is again one of the easiest ways to spot a fake. A lot of them are blank. Other fakes have ""Yugioh"" written in the top-left corner. [Here](http://th02.deviantart.net/fs39/PRE/i/2008/329/8/0/Example_of_a_fake_Yugioh_card_by_Nick_Kazama.jpg) is a comparison of a real card and a fake card.


**NOTE** : The three effect-less Egyptian God Cards are the ONLY exception to this rule. When checking God cards for Legitimacy, note the set number, the font, the holofiol (which we'll get into later) and the rarity (ditto). The backs of the cards should be a normal blank yugioh card. The only difference is that Obelisk's back is blue, Ra's back is yellow, and Slifer's back is red. [Here](http://superhappycashcow.com/pic/YUGIOH/god-cards.jpg) is an example of 3 legitimate god cards. 
_________________

&gt;**Check the formatting**

Easy way to spot an English fake is the fact that it's formatted like the old Japanese cards. What I mean by this is the example of Gagagigo in the picture above. Notice how the attack and defense of the fake are inside of a box. That's pretty much how you can tell that it's fake. 

____________

&gt;**Check the rarity**

This method is becoming less-reliable due to the massive amount of reprints and upgrades Konami is giving out. If you have a suspected fake card, you can take a look at the rarity. If you are familiar with what rarity is what then you should be able to tell what you have. Once you know your card name and rarity, look it up on the wikia. Expand the ""TCG/OCG sets"" category and it will list every set the card was printed in and every rarity it was printed in. If your card's rarity isn't on there then you've got a fake.

_______________

&gt;**Check the holofoil**

This is the best way to spot a fake holo yugioh card. Before I start with the more difficult ones, if your card looks like [this](http://www.threenorth.com/personal/fake-yugioh-dragon-fgd.png/image_preview) then it's fake. Note the spiral ""parallel rare"" pattern. Konami has never done this and if you own these you'll know how bad they look. 

Other fake holofoils are also easy to spot if you know what to look for. This method only applies to supers, ultras, secrets, and ghost rares. Here's how Konami prints their cards: They take the cardstock and place the foil film over that. They then print the image over the holofoil film. For fakes, it's the reverse. They print the image onto a piece of cardstock. Then then cover that in cheap holofoil film. You'll notice that a fake card is usually very reflective. [Here's](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2R-RxxsSN_8&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=222s) an example of a fake holofoil card. 


__________

&gt;**Check the Name**

Obviously from that video you notice that Stardust Dragon's name clearly wasn't Stardust Dragon. This is pretty self-explanatory. If a card's name doesn't match the card then it's probably fake. There also is a very slight possibility that the card may be a production error which you can read about in my other thread: ""Do I have a Misprint?"" - A Simple Guide.

 ________________

&gt;**Spelling, Grammar, and wording**

This one's also very obvious. If you notice that a card's misspelling a lot of words or it's written in very poor English then it's safe to say that you have a fake. There are known errors in real yugioh cards that have misspelled words. Those can also be found in my other thread. Usually a real card will not have more than 1 card misspelled. If the grammar seems like it was translated with google, then you more than likely have a fake. If you're familiar with the way yugioh card are worded, you'll also notice that fakes word things differently, in very poor English.

_______________

&gt;**Exodia has never existed in 1 card**

Exodia Necross and Exodius do not count. 1-card Exodias do not exist in Yugioh. If you see one, it's fake.

_____________________

&gt;**How do I avoid buying fake cards?**

Fake cards aren't as prominent now as they were back in the mid 2000's but they still exist and there is still the risk of you getting a hold of them. I'll start off by telling you that you more than likely NEVER find fake cards at Walmart, Target, K-Mart, and other large/chain stores. Your local hobby store isn't likely to carry fakes as no store wants that rumor going around. If your store is sanctioned then you have even less to worry about.

**PLACES TO AVOID**: Dollar stores, flea markets, unfamiliar shops in foreign countries, and Garage Sales.

While sometimes you'll find legitimate cards at the three places you'll notice that people will sell entire decks of fakes for a dollar. Unless you know how to spot real products then I'd recommend not buying. If a deal seems too good to be true, then it probably is. Nobody wants to be ""that kid with the fake cards"". Don't fall for the scam unless you want to collect fakes. Personally, I do collect fakes that I come across because some are hilariously bad or I can use them as examples.

In my [previous report](http://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/comments/1e8xab/locals_report_51213_watts/) I tied for 4th place, and I came back with a vengeance. So, how did it all shape up?


**Pre-Tournament** 

Prior to the tournament, I had devoted myself to buying a Gagaga Cowboy if anyone had one. If I had ordered it online, it would not have gotten here in time, but I was able to snag a 1st edition one from a player for a cool $20.

I had recently gotten into Infernities and was thinking about building the deck until I found a friend who had all the cards I needed, and after some haggling, I traded my Gem-Knight deck for his Infernity. This was fine with me as the Gem-Knights are really only truly amazing alongside Big Eye/Dracossack, both cards the friend I traded to had with him. Infernities are also great, so although it may have been hard to part with the GKs, I'm now excited to finish a great competitive deck in Infernities. 

* NOT TO MENTION I also got a Starliege Paladynamo (my third overall) and a Constellar Omega in the trade, which were promptly put into the Extra Deck. 

At this point, the tournament begins. 

**Here is the exact deck I used for the tournament:**  http://i.imgur.com/tuEfBYr.png

The deck is a combination of /u/philythemaster Local Winning Deck ([HERE](http://imgur.com/a/3fXZX#0)) and his YCS Deck ([HERE](http://imgur.com/a/SHegk#0)). The most notable changes are the non-mained Macro Cosmos (sided 3 copies) and the addition of a single Recycling Batteries. 

At my locals, I felt the Macro Cosmos wouldn't hurt a lot of decks, and I really wanted to keep hand presence, and the Recycling Batteries allowed me to do that. For example, I could summon Mahunder, summon a Watt, XYZ into Starliege Paladynamo, use it's effect and detach two materials, and then Recycling Batteries them back into my hand. The one mained copy helped a ton.

**Round 1 - Macro Rabbit**

* Game 1: The same guy playing the Rabbit deck I played last time at locals, although this time he managed to get Dolkka out. After discarding a Thunder Sea Horse to get two more, I set a Threatening Roar and ended my turn (I tended to go with this play A LOT if I went first, basically to feel my opponent out and have them waste MST/Heavy Storm). He eventually made Dolkka, negated my two Sea Horses over the course of two turns, but I had sufficient stall to keep him at bay while the Watts poked around. **WIN**

* Game 2: Opened two Swords of Revealing Light, Threatening Roar, Sea Horse. He summoned Thunder King Rai-Oh much to my chagrin, so I stalled with Roar and Swords until some Watts came to poke around. He summoned a Guaiba and was visibly frustrated in BOTH of our decks, and XYZ'ed into Utopia to keep me at bay. I got three Watts on the field, attacked with two which were promptly negated by Utopia, then attacked his Utopia with Wattgiraffe, replayed the attack and attacked directly, and during MP2 went into Gagaga Cowboy for game. **WIN**

1-0

**Round 2 - Karakuri**

* Game 1: I was told by my opponent this wasn't the infamous Desmond Johnson Psychic Stun variation, but after he opened with a Burei, Bureido, and Naturia Beast, the four Spell cards in my hand did nothing to help me, and it was quick after that. **LOSS**

* Game 2: Opened the usual Threatening Roar in hand, set it, and passed. He got out Naturia Beast again, but I summoned Wattpheasant in my next turn, attacked directly, banished the Beast, and played a Messenger of Peace to protect myself. He couldn't come back after that. **WIN**

* Game 3: Woo, this was a doozy. We both opened well, I had a Sea Horse and a Duality to search power, along with some stall. He opened the usual spammy cards, oh, and a ROYAL DECREE. Thankfully the sided in copies of Messenger of Peace helped to alleviate that. At some point, however, he got out a Scrap Dragon and started blowing cards up, but I was able to go into Starliege Paladynamo to make his Scrap Dragon useless. Brought out Mahunder and Giraffe, attacked directly with Giraffe, dropped him to 800 Life Points, and well, you know what happened next. Gagaga Cowboy put the final nail in the coffin. **WIN**

2-0

**Round 3 - Crystal Beasts**

I don't know how CBs made it this far. No one expected it, I guess. He even beat EVILSWARMS in round 1 from a respected player. He knew his deck, and he played it very well.

* Game 1: I don't know what Crystal Beast cards do, but none of it made a difference against Watts. Cobras and Giraffes had a field day. **WIN**

* Game 2: Lava Golem made a big appearance, shutting down what monster presence he had while I stalled around it. He eventually made Utopia and summoned another Crystal Beast, but I Dark Hole'd to maintain field presence and grabbed the victory soon after. **WIN**

3-0

**SEMIFINALS**

**Round 4 - Chaos**

* Game 1: He mistakenly summoned Gorz after a direct attack, along with Mahunder on the field, only to have Paladynamo make Gorz useless. Stall held the game. **WIN**

* Game 2: After activating Swords of Revealing Light and setting a Threatening Roar just in case, he Heavy Storm'ed, to which I chained the Roar. He summoned Dimensional Alchemist and got his effect off and ended. With no fear of Heavy, I set three cards and summoned Wattcobra, attacked, added another Wattcobra, and maintained backrow presence while continuously dropping more Wattcobras and drawing more backrow. **WIN**

4-0

**FINAL ROUND**

Watts **vs.** Prophecy

The one person at locals that runs Prophecy, a deck that I decided a long time ago to never play unless I had to. Countless times I've left games on DN because watching the Prophecy player Solitaire their deck and end up with at least a +4 in cards doesn't feel right to me. So what better time than now?

* Round 1: He opened only what I can assume to be broken, with HPOP in his hand and a lot of searching. No chainable traps, and the stall I did have became easy targets for his High Priestess. I had nowhere to go after an Effect Veiler stopped me dead. **LOSS**

* Round 2: I didn't know a deck I thought was so good (Prophecy) could open so bad. He told me how much he hated his initial hand, though he summoned Justice of Prophecy, activated Secrets, added Master, and on his End Phase used Justice's effect, banished and added an HPOP along with another Spellbook card. The Mind Crush I had set dropped not only the HPOP he added in hand, but a second one he had also! Wattgiraffe came in and poked around, and he never had an answer to it. **WIN**

* Game 3: He again was physically demoralized at his opening hand. He set a monster and passed. I set a Solemn Warning and Roar, and after he activated Heavy Storm, I chained Roar. He ended, I summoned Wattcobra and started to bring it down. He summoned Justice, only to get it Compulsed, and I continued to bring out more Watts to drive it home. He again tried to summon Justice only to have me play Fiendish Chain and leave it dead. **Summon. Stun. Win.**

And that was it. I went 5-0 and won with Watts. Players talked about how deceptive it was, how I could beat down with weenies and stop you from doing anything about it. 

I love how the deck ran, and the summons into Starliege Paladynamo made it all the much better. The single copy of Recycling Batteries was amazing and allowed me to keep momentum. 

MVP Card of the Day: **Wattgiraffe** - Without it, I wouldn't go into the XYZ summons I did, I had no fear of backrow for the rest of the turn, and I tended to draw into it enough to stick my opponents for some good damage.

Hope you enjoyed the report!

Today I was looking and the Masked Chameleon post and thinking of a deck to use it in when I noticed the pile of Steelswarms beside me all had 0 defence. This is the earliest build I have made, but it turned out pretty well.



**Updated List** http://imgur.com/xrWKSm2

Monsters: 27


**Steelswarm Scout**

He stops you from special summoning for the turn, but can lead to an instant tribute Steelswarm play which leads to a Girastag or Moth in the grave for a good Masked Chameleon play. You can ditch it with Grepher and One for Once, more than 1 can be dead.

Run 1

**Steelswarm Caller**

This guy lets you special a Steelswarm when tributed, he is mostly in the deck because of his 0 defence and instant level 8 plays, plus fact that he makes an instant Ophion or king gremlin with Castor.

run 3

**Steelswarm Sentinal**

Tourguide target, he sucks balls. Other than another Grepher discard target and level 7 synchro with Chameleon he is useless.

run 1

**Steelswarm Moth**

Amazing, he is a double compulse for the cost of 1000 life points and a steelswarm tribute (scout). Sadly there are no easy to make 10's.

run 2

**Steelswarm Girastag**

BEST CARD IN THE DECK. Level 7 but only requires 1 Steelswarm tribute to summon. *Sends* one card to the graveyard and you gain 1000 lifepoints. Plus he is an instant Star Eater with Chameleon. Too good.

run 3

**Tourguide**

It's tourguide. Brings out sentinal.

run 2 because it's at 2 

**Dark Grepher**

Ditchs Girastag and other steelswarms for easy Chameleon plays. Can be special summon or used to make King of the Feral Imps.

run 2

**Evilswarm Kerykeion**

It can target any steelswarm or evilswarm, making it amazing. Quick Ophion plays or search with King of the Feral imps.

run 1


**Evilswarm Mandragora**

makes ophion or king, extra target for infection.

run 3

**Evilswarm Castor**

Allows an extra normal for any Ilswarm monster. Instant ophion with caller or Mandragora.

run 3


**Masked Chameleon**

AMAZING, makes the deck. Searchable with imps and makes instant 5,7,8,10*,11 synchros.

run 3


**Effect Veiler**

Good this format another Chameleon target I guess.

run 2


**Maxx C**

The draw power helps the deck like crazy.

run 2


**Mystical Space Typhoon**

Gets rid of trouble cards and lets your play go through.

run 3

**Heavy Storm**

staple

Run 1

**Dark Hole**

run 1


**Monster Reborn**

run 1

**One for One** 

Ditch a 0 defence Steelswarm get out scout or veiler.

run 1

**Recurring Nightmare**

Adds back nearly any Steelswarm for Scout plays.

run 2

**Infestation Pandemic**

Protects Steelswarms and Evilswarms.

run 2

**Foolish Burial**

Ditchs scout or girastag

run 1

**Infestation Infection**

Get whatever Steelswarm or Evilswarm you want to hand. Blocks scout plays.

1362123956.0,45,self.yugioh,19gaoa,How the hell did you beat me with only 1 star normal monsters? A guide to 1 Star Normal Monster OTK,60,15,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/comments/19gaoa/how_the_hell_did_you_beat_me_with_only_1_star/," This deck was a well received post I did a while back so I thought to write it up while deck guides are hot. 

 Pros: 
You can make this deck for less than 5$ IRL no problem
Humiliate your opponent
Feel like the greatest underdog that ever lived

Cons:
You are playing with a deck that is mostly 1 star normal monsters

The deck:

20-22: 1 Star Normal monsters

High Defense is the best (Bunilla, D.D. Trainer, Flamvell Guard, Oppressed People, Oppressed People, Water Spirit) 

3:Heart of the Underdog

During your draw phase, if you draw a normal monster you can reveal it to your opponent and draw one more card. 
This makes you draw an absurd amount, especially if you can get 2 on the field. 

1:Ultimate offering

Flooding the field with your little bastards.

3: Enchanting Fitting Room

This card allows you draw the top 4 cards of your deck and special summon any normal monsters among them, since this deck is crammed with them, this is the best way to flood the field fast.

3:Triangle Power

This card gives all 1 star normal monster 2000 attack. 

3:Law of the Normal

You activate this card when you have 5 face up level 1 monsters on the field. You and your opponent get rid of everything on the field and in your hands. This is what leaves your opponent open for the OTK.




So here's a rundown of how the OTK works.

Step 1: Get 5 1 Star Normal monsters on the field. (by combination of ultimate offering/EFR)

Step2: Active Triangle Power Making them all Beat sticks.

Step3: Active Law of the Normal and Leave your opponent Speechless.

Step3: Attack for game and drink your opponents Tears.




Note: The last 8-10 cards of the deck are your choosing. I'd advise with anything and everything you can think to stall your opponent with. Solemn's, MST's, bottomless etc. The important thing is to remember that your deck is for fun.

In lieu of all of these awesome guides for archetype and sub-archetype decks, I'd like to cast the Evilswarm 'lot' into the bunch.
    
**Preface - Evilswarms and the Lore behind them**    

The Evilswarms (Verz in OCG) are a new archetype that is being released into Yugioh TCG on April 19th via Hidden Arsenal 7: Knights of Stars. The corrupted beasts are all perverted forms of past and present Duel Terminal archetype monsters that have been infected with the 'lswarm' virus. The monsters and support cards focus on controlling the pace of the game as well as limiting the plays your opponent can make and all the while methodically winning the duel.    

    

**1.0 Heart of the Swarm** 

* This is the core of most, if not all Evilswarm decks.
    
__________________________________________________________        
**1.1 The Monsters**

* *1.1.1 The Evilswarms*

* **Evilswarm Heliotrope:** A vanilla 1950 beater that just happens to be 50 ATK higher than Thunder King Rai-Oh. More importantly, a trio of these will be your targets for Rescue Rabbit. More on that later. **RUN: 3**

* **Evilswarm Castor:** At a respectable 1750 ATK, Castor sets up the go-to combo for all Evilswarm decks. Unlike Rescue Rabbit, Castor's effect sets a condition on the field. So the extra normal summon you'd get because he was normal summoned cannot be stopped by cards such as **Effect Veiler**, **Fiendish Chain**, **Breakthrough Skill**, **Herald of Orange Light**, or **Forbidden Chalice**. **RUN: 3**

* **Evilswarm Kerykeion:** Kerykeion shares the same effect with it's counterpart, **Constellar Sombres**, in that once per turn it can banish an Evilswarm from the grave, then target another in the grave and return it to your hand. And if you use this effect you get another **Normal Summon** during the turn you used his effect. Perfect for grave manipulation and quick rank 4 XYZ summoning. Kerykeion does have a third effect that will never be used in this build sense you won't be running lvl 5 Evilswarms. **RUN: 3**

*  **Evilswarm Mandragora:** Lvl 4 monster that has the ability to be special summoned from your hand if your opponent controls more monsters than you. If you're lacking a **Rescue Rabbit** or **Evilswarm Castor** in hand, then this card is even more useful. **RUN: 2 - 3**

* **Evilswarm Thunderbird:** Lvl 4 monster that has the unique ability of banishing itself when any effect, be it monster or S/T, is activated and then return to the field in your next standby phase with 300 more ATK making it 1950. What's really unique about this card is that when it is returned from the banish to your field it's explicitly just 'returned'. **No summoning takes place**, therefor it can't be Solemned, Torrentialed, and it's a great way to get around a Thunder King Rai-Oh. **RUN: 3**    

* 1.1.2 *The Other Monsters*

* **Dark Armed Dragon:** Works great with Evilswarms. Generally, you won't be swarming the field with your dark monsters which gives your opponent less opportunities to put them into your grave, if they can even manage that. So having too many darks is rarely an issue. If it is an issue that's where **Kerykeion** and his grave manipulating effect can come in handy. Everyone should know why D.A.D is useful but he can also be a dead draw in an opening hand. **RUN: 1**

* **Effect Veiler:** Some people like to main Veiler and some don't. It's usually a matter of player preference. I'd contend in an Evilswarm deck that it shouldn't be preference, it should be standard to main 2. In a deck who's main focus is to get out Ophion, protect Ophion, and then lock down the field with Ophion, you might run into some people who might want to get rid of him (sarcasm). Thankfully, Ophion can search out his own protection against spells and traps, but what about monster effects? Well, Veiler solves that issue pretty well. More on Ophion later. **RUN: 2**

* **Rescue Rabbit:** As if the Evilswarm Castor engine to get out quick Rank 4 XYZ monsters wasn't enough, give your opponents a fit with this staple from the past few formats. Rabbit just fits in well with this deck. It gives more consistency in a build that **NEEDS** to get Ophion out and churning. The obvious (and only) target for Rabbit is **Evilswarm Heliotrope**. Why do you run only 1x playset of vanillas with 2 Rabbits? Well, with an already effective engine built into Evilswarms, Rabbit just adds to the consistency. Running another playset of vanillas would leave the deck too clogged up. There's also a certain trap you can run specific to the Evilswarm archetype that can help with hands that include 2x Heliotrope and a rabbit. **RUN: 2**

___________________________________________________________

**1.2 The Spells**

* *1.2.1 Archetype Spell*

* **Infestation Pandemic:** Quite possibly the most important card in your entire deck. Ophion's effect allows this to be searched from your deck and then put into your hand. It works just like Forbidden Lance, except is puts a blanket over **ALL** Evilswarm monsters that are and would be on your side of the field that turn and it doesn't have the downside of dwindling a monster's attack down. This will be the first card to get hit by some kind of limited or semi-limited status come September format change. **RUN: 3**

*1.2.2 Staple Spells*

* **Allure of Darkness:** Pretty self explanatory. Draw two, then banish a dark monster. If you have no dark monster to banish, then you have to discard your hand. Play conservatively as it can backfire on you easily. **RUN: 1**

* **Heavy Storm:** Clears that heavy backrow so Ophion or the like can be summoned unhindered. Be weary of **Starlight Road**! **RUN: 1**

* **Monster Reborn:** A zero cost card that allows you to bring almost any monster from either players graveyard back to your side of the field is just too good to not run. **RUN: 1**

* **Mystical Space Typhoon:** The younger brother to Heavy Storm. Needs no real explanation. Watch out for **Abyss-Sphere**! **RUN: 2 - 3**

* **Reinforcement of the Army:** Allows you to search for Evilswarm Castor, one of your main play-makers in the deck. **RUN: 1**

*1.2.3 Spell Tech Options/Personal Flair*

* **Forbidden Dress:** With your own archetype specific Forbidden Lance on steroids, you might want to consider something to protect your monsters against monster effects. Dress is a great choice, but it comes with a cost. Losing 600 attack can lead to your Ophion getting beat in head on battle. Be wary. Has the versatility to be chained during the Damage Step onto an opponent's monster as well, which could save your Ophion from an attack from a bigger beater. **RUN: 2**

* **Forbidden Lance:** With **Infestation Pandemic**, Lance is a bit outclassed. You may still find it has a place in your deck where you might need to target your own monster or even an opponent's monster (fire fists anyone?) **RUN: 2**

* **Pot of Avarice:** With 2x Rabbits and only one playset of vanillas, Avarice might find a home in your main deck if you feel the need to recycle Heliotropes and other monsters back into your deck. It is a VERY dead draw in the early and mid-game setting. **RUN: 1**

* **Pot of Duality:** Duality is nice in the fact that you get your choice of the top 3 cards in your deck, but it also prevents power plays with **Rabbit** and **Mandragora**. Both Castor and Kerykeion's effects allow you to have an additional normal summon, thus getting around Duality. No overlaying though :/. **RUN: 1 -2**

* **Dark Hole:** WHAT? A STAPLE YOU SAY? Well, you'd be correct in most decks, but Dark Hole isn't necessarily needed in a deck that generally locks down SS level 5 or higher monsters. Sure, it has its uses like chaining a Pandemic to it's activation, clearing your opponent's field and not yours. Figure out where you want it. **RUN: 1**

* **Creeping Darkness:** Has the potential to work in this build, but it can hinder Evilswarm Kerykeion as well as Dark Armed Dragon's effect. **RUN: 1 -2**

* **Dark Mambele:** A nice card, but it has the potential of sitting dead in your hand. Controlling 3 or more dark monsters at the same time may seem simple enough in a deck of almost all dark attributes but rarely will you have a field with 3+ dark monsters on it, and when you do this card won't be in your hand usually. Being able to banish the target card is a really nice effect though. **RUN: 1-2**

___________________________________________________________

**1.3 The Traps**

* *1.3.1 Archetype Traps*

* **Infestation Infection:** The only archetype trap you'll be running. Fairly straightfoward effect, you can return 1 Evilswarm monster from your hand or field to the deck in exchange for another Evilswarm monster from your deck. The trap is searchable by Ophion's effect and can come in handy if you have the extremely rare 2x Heliotrope-in-hand syndrome. You **CANNOT** return an Evilswarm monster to the extra deck. Recycling Ophion would be so cool :/. From my understanding of the rulings, sending an Evilswarm monster to your deck is a cost, so even if your trap is solemn'd you would still have to shuffle an Evilswarm monster back into your deck. This could work for and against you in some cases. **RUN: 1**

* *1.3.2 Staple Traps*

* **Solemn Judgment:** Big daddy himself. Can stop virtually everything except monster effects. Obviously be wary of using this as it takes away half of your LP. **RUN: 1**

* **Solemn Warning:** Can stop summons and effects from monsters/spells/traps that summon monsters. It's only at one now so use it wisely! **RUN: 1**

* **Compulsory Evacuation Device:** Some may argue that this isn't considered a staple, but it's splashable in any deck build. One of the easiest ways to get around pesky monster effects that prevent destruction, and can sended XYZ, Synchros, and Fusions back to the extra deck. In some cases, using on your own monster can prove to be beneficial as well! **RUN: 2 - 3**

* **Torrential Tribute:** Another trap thats staple status is debatable in some decks. It works so well with Evilswarms that I'd almost always recommend maining it. A common combo is to **chain Infestation Pandemic** to the activation of your own TT during either either players turn, thus saving your own lswarms and clearing your opponent's field. **RUN: 1 - 2**

*1.3.3. Trap Tech Options/Personal Flair*

* **Fiendish Chain:** One of my absolute favorite traps. Stops an effect monster dead in their tracks. I find it to be extremely versatile because unlike Veiler or **Breakthrough Skill**, it prevents the target monster from attacking. It also can force the opponent to use an MST/Heavy Storm to get rid of it, which obviously gives them less backrow clearing options in the later game. **RUN: 2**

* **Starlight Road/The Huge Revolution is Over:** The general uses for these two traps are very similar. If you can make room in your extra deck for a Stardust Dragon, run Starlight Road. If not, run Revolution. Whereas Starlight has an added optional effect of getting Stardust out, Revolution **banishes** the card it was chained to. Judgement Dragon would be a great target for Revolution. Make them pay 1000, then banish their beloved dragon. These should be seeing even more use come March 1st due to the loss of a Solemn Warning and the likely addition of cards like Torrential Tribute. **RUN: 1**

* **Bottomless Trap Hole:** Some consider it a staple in decks, but I wouldn't consider it a necessity for Evilswarms. You're generally better off running 2x Torrential or 2x Chain over 2x Bottomless. Still has its uses though. Good for getting taking monsters out of the foreseeable game unless they have access to their banish pile. **RUN: 1 - 2**

* **Dimensional Prison:** Able to banish just like Bottomless, except when the monster declares an attack instead of being summoned. This is nice because it has no minimum attack power requirement like Bottomless. The fact of the matter is that your strategy with Evilswarm should be one that doesn't give your opponent a chance to set up to even declare an attack because your 2550 attack power Ophion is the biggest monster on the field. Other traps have better uses in the main deck. **RUN: 1 -2**

* **Mirror Force:** Same principle as D-Prison. Don't give your opponent an inch to breathe with this deck and you won't need Mirrors. It does have its uses against decks that like to swarm with lower leveled monsters and then attack. **RUN: 1 - 2**

* **Deck Devastation/Eradicator Epidemic Virus:** Bahamut, Ophion, and Ouroboros are targets for Deck Devastation and Ophion and Ouroboros are targets for Eradicator. Both these cards have the potential to utterly cripple a deck that you would already be crippling with Ophion's effect. Both are very situational though. Deck Devastation would be great against Wind-Ups but not Prophecy, while Eradicator would be amazing against Prophecy. It's really personal choice of what you think you'll see more often. **RUN: 1 - 2**

* **Mind Crush:** Amazing against any deck that searches for cards. It's generally a good draw at any point in the game unless in dire situations. Recoil effect of having to discard one of your cards for declaring something not in your opponent's hand. **RUN: 2 - 3**

* **Safe Zone:** The only reason you'd want to run Safe Zone is to further protect your Ophion while he's on the field. It won't allow him to attack directly, but you can 'turtle shell' with Pandemic and Safe Zone until you find an opening. Using Pandemic also drops the effects of Safe Zone on your Evilswarm monster for that turn as well. **RUN: 2**

___________________________________________________________

**1.4 The Extra Deck**

* *1.4.1 Synchros*

* **Stardust Dragon:** Only work him into your extra deck if you plan on maining a Starlight Road. His effect should be well known enough for me to not go into detail. If Otphion is on the field, Stardust cannot be SS. Beware.

* *1.4.2 XYZ Must Haves*

* **Evilswarm Ophion:** The **MVP** of the deck. The entire point of almost any Evilswarm build is to get him out. The ease at which you can get him out is a scary fact. Using only 2 Level 4 Evilswarms will have you controlling the field in no time. Search Pandemic out from the deck using his effect, and watch your opponent writhe in pain as you sit on a monster that prevents your opponent from SSing lvl 5 or higher monsters. I**f possible, always have an overlay unit on Ophion.** Without any overlay units he gets dumbed down to a 2550 beater. **RUN: 3**

* **Evilswarm Bahamut:** The better Big Eye! You won't always go for this card, but when you do it's sure to leave your opponent in a fit of rage. With the same cost to summon as Ophion, it's very easy to get Bahamut out. He can detach an overlay unit, to discard one of your Evilswarm monsters, and then take control of an opponent's monster. Bahamut is great for mirror matches as well. Your opponent summoned and Ophion of his own? No problem, overlay into Bahamut and use his Ophion for yourself. A bit of an underwhelming attack at 2350 though, so watch out! **RUN: 2**

* **Evilswarm Ouroboros:** The boss monster of the Evilswarms. It takes 3 level 4 monsters to make this badboy. His effects aren't as generally devastating as Ophion's, but it can ruin your opponent's plays in a snap. Once per turn, you can either send 1 card on your opponent's side of the field to his hand, send a target in their graveyard to the banish pile, or discard 1 random card in their hand. Each effect can only be used once while Ouroboros is on the field. Choose wisely! RUN: 1 -2 

* *1.4.3 XYZ Rank 4 Staples*

* I won't go into much description on the rest of an Evilswarm extra deck, because generally, you won't be using much besides the terrible trio: Ophion, Bahamut, and Ourboros. Feel free to throw in staples such as **Utopia**, **Maestroke**, **Excalibur** (Castor is a warrior!), **Blackship of Corn**, **Photon Papilloperative**, **Daigusto Emeral**, **Lavaval Chain**, **Evigishki Merrowgeist**, **SHOCK MASTER**, and **Gagaga Cowboy**. Make is versatile to fit the situations you feel you'll run into the most.

___________________________________________________________

**1.5 Side Deck Options**

These are all situational. Please include more options for a side deck in the comments. Side in to counter what you see the most at your locals, on DN, etc.

* **Thunder King Rai-Oh:** His stock has gone up even more since Prophecy is on the rage. A 1900 beater with not 1 but 2 amazing effects? Yes, please. 

* **Puppet Plant:** Great for the Prophecy matchup as well as Six Sams as you can take control of a warrior monster as well. That Shi-En or Priestess will look nice on your side of the field for a turn.

* **Dimensional Fissure/Macro Cosmos:** Surprisingly easy to tech into the Evilswarm build. Just side out your Veiler, D.A.D, and perhaps Kerykeion or two and you'll have an even more anti-meta deck. These hit any cards that are reliant on discarding to the grave or effects from the grave.

* **Chaos Counter:** I've personally never tried running Chaos Counters with Evilswarms, but in theory it could be very effective if ran with Macro Cosmos/D-Fissure.

* **Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning:** An odd tech choice for most, but if you side in 2x TKRO and leave Veiler at 2x then this card should have no problem getting onto the field. **HE WINS GAMES**.

* **Gozen Match:** Dark attributes take up the vast majority of your monster pool, running using Gozen Match shouldn't prove to be an issue for the most part.

* **D.D. Crow:** It's been said recently that D.D. Crow will be a lot more useful this format, I couldn't agree more. Take that pesky Treeborn frog out of the game, or chain D.D. Crow to your opponent's Call of the Haunted or Monster Reborn so it misses timing.

* **Maxx ""C"":** This cards stock may go down in the March format. Still very effective vs. Wind Ups and Six Sams.

* **Soul Drain:** Will not hinder any card you run in the least, great for the Dark World matchup.

* **Needle Ceiling:** Such a good card against Wind Ups and Six Sams. 

* **Overworked:** Great for the Firefist matchup, would only hinder your Thunderbird... but he can just banish himself to safety. 

* **Light-Imprisoning Mirror:** With Lyla back at 3, we might see some Lightsworn action again. You can side these just in case.
 
* **Poisonous Winds:** With Harpies on the rise and Blackwings getting Kalut to 3 and an amazing level 4 XYZ monster (Sylphine, the Sub-Zero Siren) Poisonoius Winds should warrant a consideration for side deck material.

___________________________________________________________

**2.0 How the Deck Plays &amp; Basic Strategy**

* To be completely honest, Evilswarms have a very linear goal in mind. **Get out Ophion. Protect Ophion. Lockdown with Ophion. Win with Ophion**. It may seem boring but it's effective in its simplicity.

* Always leave an overlay unit attached to Ophion. Without an overlay unit, he becomes a 2550 beater with no use besides looking mean.

* Play conservatively. This deck is not meant to be an aggressor. Your strategy should be to methodically take away the resources your opponent has at his/her disposal, and then, when the timing is just right, take your opponent for game using cards like Bahamut, Excalibur, or Gagaga Cowboy.

* Finally, do not overextend yourself. Always leave yourself with an exit strategy in case your opponent Veiler's your Ophion on your opening turn or the likes.

___________________________________________________________

**3.0 Basic Combos**

* First turn opening hand: Rescue Rabbit, Fiendish Chain, Forbidden Dress

&gt;Normal Summon Rescue Rabbit  
  
&gt;Activate Rescue Rabbit's effect, banish Rabbit   
 
&gt;SS from deck Evilswarm Heliotrope 2x 
   
&gt;Overlay 2x Heliotrope for Evilswarm Ophion  
  
&gt;Detach overlay unit to search deck for Pandemic   
 
&gt;Set Pandemic and Fiendish Chain
    
&gt;End Turn    

* Opponent has 1 set S/T and 1 set monster on field. Your hand is Evilswarm Castor, Evilswarm Kerykeion, and an Infestation Pandemic. Both Evilswarm Heliotrope and Mandragora are in grave.

&gt;Normal Summon Evilswarm Castor

&gt;Using Castor effect, Normal Summon Evilswarm Kerykeion

&gt;Opponent chains Kerykeion summon with a facedown Torrential Tribute

&gt;You chain Infestation Pandemic from your hand to your opponent's Torrential Tribute

&gt;Activate Kerykeion effect

&gt;Banish E.swarm Mandragora and return Helitrope from grave to hand

&gt;Using Kerykeoin's effect, Normal Summon Evilswarm Heliotrope

&gt;Overlay all 3 monsters to SS Evilswarm Ouroboros from your Extra Deck

&gt;Detach a unit to target one random card in your opponent's hand and send it to the grave

&gt;Attack Directly for 2750

&gt;End Turn

___________________________________________________________

**4.0 Evilswarm Weaknesses**

* **Shadow-Imprisoning Mirror:** This has the potential to shut down your deck completely.

* **Rivalry of the Warlords:** Evilswarms may share the same attribute, but not the same type. Thankfully, Ophion, Bahamut, and Ouroboros are dragons.

* **Decks that Normal Summon instead of Special Summon:** Hazy Beasts instantly come to mind.

* **Decks that run low level monsters:** Inzektors, Wind Ups, and Firefist don't generally SS anything over level 4.

* **Skill Drain:** Not many decks can main it, but watch out for the oddballs that can.

1351871023.0,51,self.yugioh,12inv2,11/1 Locals Tournament Report,54,3,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/comments/12inv2/111_locals_tournament_report/,"In an effort to give this subreddit meaningful content I'm going to try doing these as much as possible. I usually find them an interesting read and its nice to know as many local metas as possible.

**The Deck**
I brought Chaos Dragons to this tournament. This was 25% meta-call, 75% preference. Chaos Dragons have always been my favored and preferred deck and its simply what I always feel most comfortable in. The meta-call portion is because most meta decks right now have difficulty dealing with a constant flow of huge beaters other than DW; my locals is 100% meta decks and nobody plays the alt-win conditions (which Chaos Dragons despise) so I feel a bit safer playing the deck.

My main deck is constructed in such a way that it provides significant game 1 advantage vs Wind-Ups (which I did not play) and Geargia (I played 2); and for that it suffers heavily against decks like DW and Heroes. I main 3 Effect Veiler and 2 Maxx ""C"". The game plan against these decks is to try to get mill off and draw as few hand traps as possible, but usually the side helps me mount a comeback after losing game 1.

**The Tourney**

Round 1: Geargias (2-1 Win)

Game 1: 

I had never seen this player before, he explains to me while I'm shuffling that this is his first tourney ever and that he's a complete newbie to the Yu-Gi-Oh game. I hate when I play people like this because Chaos Dragons tends to not give weaker players a chance to play; its simply too fast and overcomes too many obstacles for a quick kill. I win the die roll and am not too alarmed when I draw into a hand filled with big beaters and no mill outlets; I decide to just pass to start throwing things into the grave from the hand. I'm quickly OTKed by a spam of geargias and machinas.

Game 2: 

At this point I'm wondering if I've just been trolled into complacency (which is a mistake no matter who you play) and decide to side into my Cybers and Electric Viruses. I quickly realize he wasn't joking when he tries to Pot of Avarice spells/traps and Duality after Special Summoning. I draw a lot better this game and can get mill off; he has plenty of backrow but after powering through it I just kept poking with Lightpulsar with the soft-lock (REDMD+Lightpulsar) on board for game.

Game 3:

He swarms the board turn 1, ending up with a face-up Machina Fortress, a Geargiarmor, and a Geargiaccelerator - Maxx ""C"" was chained to the Armor effect so he stopped after specialing accelerator. Cyber Dragon is specialed, a 4k Chimeratech comes out, and he is OTKed. I try to give him as many tips as I can (the most basic being not to swarm the board without protection) seeing as I don't know his deck very well and continue on my way.



**Round 2: Geargia (2-1 Win)**

Game 1:

This game is against one of the area's stronger players. I knew from a previous tournament he was running the Karakuri variant so I knew I had to go off ASAP or else I would be OTKed. I lost the dice roll and draw mediocre; I opened with a Lyla and Recharge which is usually quite good but I draw into hand traps and mill Heavy and Reborn. The game goes quite slow, with my Rykos milling terribly and his attempts to push stopped by Maxx ""C""s and Veilers. Eventually I'm able to get a solid play through backrow with Darkflare, Eclipse, and Lightpulsar in hand and he's beat down.

Game 2:

I side into the same as the last Geargia match along with one additional tech card. He starts with a set, I draw, get some mill going, and pass with Gorz in hand. I have no hand traps to save me and he senses this when his Armor effect goes through so he attempts to go off, however his hand was not the best so he only ends up with a Karakuri Dog and Burei on board; I decide not to drop Gorz on the dog to preserve my LP (this would prove to be a mistake). The next turn I E-Virus both of his monsters and go off in an attempt to OTK; I vomit my hand onto the board and into the grave (pitching Gorz for a Lightpulsar); the push is stopped at the last second with a very well-timed D.D. Crow targeting the Lightpulsar REDMD was reviving.

He lives with 100 LP after my push. His Burei is returned to him (I used the dog to Tribute Summon) and I have no cards in hand; he destroys REDMD with Burei and Monster Reborns it. I have literally zero outs to my own REDMD. I top-deck into Tour Guide, knowing he has a singular backrow - either I attempt to kill him over my own REDMD with Acid Golem or I die next turn. Zenmaines would be a useless stall attempt. I make Acid Golem and run into D-Prison. Game.

Game 3:

I draw into the card I teched into the side; depending on how this card worked it could win me the game. I get my mill going, summon Darkflare and set the tech and pass. He MSTs the backrow (its common for Chaos Dragons in my area to side into backrow) and its flipped - Deck Devastation Virus tributes Darkflare Dragon and takes out the 5 remaining cards in his hand. He can't recover at all and I quickly take the game.


**Round 3: Atlanteans (2-1 Win)** 

Game 1:

I immediately remember this player; I played him on the bubble of Sunday's tournament (prizes being GGX, Grandsoils, etc) while he was playing Plant Synchro and he drew absolutely broken two games in a row, crushing me. I resolve to myself for that not to happen again before the match. Other than that there's not much to say about this game; he can't really establish presence and I beat him down with LP pokes turn after turn.

Game 2:

Much like the last game there wasn't really anything notable about this one. I draw fairly bad and keep passing until he establishes enough of his pieces to go off and leave me unable to come back.

Game 3:

He sits on a Level Limit Area for quite a while. I eventually draw into DDV and set it, hoping it doesn't get randomly EP MSTed. It does not; next turn I summon Darkflare and tribute him for DDV, crushing his field and hand. I use the time that it buys me to try to get rid of the Level Limit Area; I eventually have to use Exa-beetle to get it off the board and quickly kill him from there. He had one back-row at the end of the game and flips it in response to the last attack - another Level Limit Area set? He laughs about it and takes the loss well.


**Round 4: Heroes (0-2 Loss)**

Game 1:

I can't really establish board presence and the game becomes Alius beatdown. He has answers to everything I do and my hand is full of dead draws - hand traps are nearly useless against this deck. I had hoped not to play this deck due to their dwindling popularity but it was not the case. I lost this game 1900 at a time.

Game 2:

I draw nothing turn 1 and pass. He normals Fossil Dyna and suddenly my entire hand becomes completely dead. I was counting on a Gorz drop to sit on as I had no milling outlets. I topdeck Card Trooper and thank my luck until I mill 2 Lights and a Spell; its fine though because now the Fossil Dyna dies. The next turn he summons another and neither of the two draws I get from trooper+turn draw can help me, and I quickly die soon after.


I was expecting this to happen should I play Heroes or DW; I consciously built my deck weak against those decks due to their low popularity here. It happens.


**Top 8: Six Samurais (2-1 Win)**

Game 1:

First turn Nat Beast with a Reborn in hand fucks me. I only have so many mill outlets and answers to one naturia beast, but two makes it really difficult for me. He spams monsters out after I attempt to stall for card troopers or rykos and kills me.

Game 2:

The Naturia Beast shows its face once again, but this time I have answers to him. Ryko answers each Synchro he makes and he can't establish dominance on the field; I make him waste cards until he's in topdecking mode and Sams really cannot topdeck. I spam monsters out once he's out of resources and kill him.

Game 3:

This game started out horrible. When I drew my 6th card I was already staring down a Naturia Beast, 2 backrow, and a Grandmaster. I pass and take damage. On my next turn I set Ryko and kill his beast, milling a Light and a Dark, which is what I perfectly needed to start going off. I dropped Trag on the Grandmaster's attack and he had no response - Trag was at 3k and the lack of a response tells me he has no Warning. He makes a crazy play in his MP2 that instantly tells me both his backrow are bluffs - he synchro summons Shi-En and overlays Shi-En and Grandmaster for Adreus in order to destroy Tragoedia.

I decide to simply spam out my hand knowing that both backrow were useless. Darkflare is summoned to start dumping out Lights/Darks, retrieving REDMD and getting Lightpulsars to summon. His field is decimated and he is basically in top decking mode. He draws, shows me Gateway and a handshake.


**Top 4: Heroes (2-0 Win)**

Game 1:

This is the same Hero player that beat me 0-2 in Swiss. In the first few turns it seems to be the same situation as our first games; Thunder King is beating me down and I have no answers. Eventually I'm able to mount a come back; Royal Decree is flipped on his end phase and Card Trooper crashes into his TKing. With the mills I get (along with some Recharges in hand) I'm able to go off and kill him without fear of traps.

Game 2:

There isn't really much to say about this game. Sadly he didn't draw a single monster and Decree meant he couldn't stay in the game for long. I drew fairly bad too but I at least was able to get a Card Trooper out and keep poking down at him. I always felt these types of hands were the problem with Heroes; its entirely possible to simply die straight-out to a lowly Card Trooper because you have no answers.


I saw that the other top 4 match was Heroes vs Hieratic; I would much rather face the Hieratic due to my plethora of hand-traps. Lo and behold, Heroes win - this is one of my most hated match-ups with this current build. I have too many dead draws and I do not main Lance - super-heavy backrow decks annoy me to no end. Luckily, he offers a top 2 split, and as the time was creeping close to midnight and I hated the matchup I obliged.


Overall, I feel my deck did well. I built it with local meta in mind and the hand traps were helpful 90% of the time - before adding in as much as I could of them (3 mained Veiler 2 mained C one sided C, 2 trag 1 gorz) I felt defenseless a lot of the time. Its easy to play passive until I see a chance to OTK. Deck Devi was also an awesome choice - it literally won me games the second it was flipped and can save REDMD and Darkflare from D-Prisons. I will also be trying a new 3-of hand trap in the side deck next week once Mermails are legal, but I'll talk about that once the time comes.

Two months ago I struck up a trade with him again, not realizing it was the same guy at first.

----------------------------------

Here is a compilation post taken from other threads, my own/other redditor's input, as well stuff taken from Yugioh wiki. I'll try to clean up posts as well (with credit of course):

**So what exactly has changed?**

**In 2008, a new type and way of summoning was introduced called Synchro Summoning:**

""During your Main Phase 1 or 2, when the total Level of a face-up Tuner monster and 1 or more face-up Non-Tuner monster(s) you control is exactly the Level of a Synchro Monster in your Extra Deck, you can perform a Synchro Summon. These Tuner monster and the non-Tuner monster(s) will be called the Synchro Material Monsters.

In order to Synchro Summon a Synchro Monster from your Extra Deck (under normal conditions), you must declare the action and send the Synchro Material Monsters to the Graveyard. After sending the monsters from your side of the field to the Graveyard, you then take the Synchro Monster from your Extra Deck and place it in face-up Attack Position or Defense Position on your side of the field.""

Example of a synchro monster: http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Stardust_Dragon

**In 2011, another way of summoning called XYZ (pronounced ik-seez) Summoning was introduced:**

Xyz Summons can be conducted when there are two or more monsters of the same Level on your side of the field. Those monsters can be used as Xyz Materials to Summon an Xyz Monster whose Rank is the same as the Levels of the monsters used.

In order to Xyz Summon an Xyz Monster, you must first take the required Xyz Materials face-up on your side of the field and stack them together (called overlaying in the anime). Then, the Xyz Monster is Xyz Summoned from your Extra Deck, and placed on top of the stack.

Xyz Materials are not sent to the Graveyard. Instead, they are placed on the same Monster Card Zone beneath the Summoned Xyz Monster.

The respective battle positions of the Xyz Materials do not matter, so long as they are all face-up. However, once you have Xyz Summoned your Xyz Monster, ensure that the entire stack is neatly aligned in face-up attack position, regardless of whether or not the Xyz Monster is summoned in face-up ATK or DEF position.

An Xyz Summon is a type of Special Summon, and an Xyz Monster is a Special Summon-only monster.

Some effects may require you to remove Xyz Materials from an Xyz Monster. In this case, the required Xyz Materials are taken from beneath the Xyz Monster in question and sent to the Graveyard. This is known as detaching. Be wary though, as some such effects may have a downside if an Xyz Monster has no Xyz Materials left beneath it.

Note that an Xyz Monster Special Summoned via any means other than an Xyz Summon (except for Xyz Reborn) will not have any Xyz Materials beneath it. Therefore, any negative effects that might apply to an Xyz Monster in such a state will be applied immediately.

If an Xyz Monster is flipped face-down, the Xyz Materials beneath it are not sent to the Graveyard.

If a card that would banish cards sent to the graveyard (such as ""Macro Cosmos"" or ""Banisher of the Radiance"") is in effect, when an Xyz Monster is destroyed/removed from the field the Xyz Materials beneath it are banished. However if an effect that would banish a monster(s) on the field (like ""Dimensional Fissure"") is activated, only the Xyz Monster will be affected. The Materials used will be sent to the Graveyard.

Example of an XYZ Monster: http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Number_39%3A_Utopia

Now onto deck construction

courtesy of dan_n:

**Staples**

Many decks nowadays run:  

Monsters:  
2/3 Effect Veiler
Card Car D
Maxx C

Spells:  
1 Book of Moon  
1 Dark Hole  
1 Heavy Storm  
1 Monster Reborn  
2/3 Mystical Space Typhoon

Traps:  
1 Solemn Judgment  
1 Solemn Warning  
2 Torrential Tribute

Other notable, but not staple traps:

* Compulsory Evacuation Device
* Bottomless Trap Hole
* Fiendish Chain
* Safe Zone
* Mirror Force
* Dimensional Prison

Other card that work well in many decks are **Cardcar D (questionable)** and **Gorz, the Emissary of Darkness**


**Meta**  

The current meta consists mainly of E. Dragon, Prophecy, Mermail, Evilswarm, and Fire Fist (Tempest Dragunity floats around sometimes)

Other good, budget deck options:  

* Agents 
* Dark World (Structure deck released October 18, 2011)
* Gravekeeper's (Just cheap overall, graveyard control deck)
* Hero variants (Bubblebeat/Arrive Hero) 
* Lightsworn variants (lots of re-releases in recent packs) 
* Six Samurai (Structure deck released on June 26, 2012) 
* Machina Gadgets
* Gladiator Beast
* Dino Rabbits (key pieces released in 2012 Tins (Evolzar's, Rescue Rabbit, Tour Guide))
* Madolche


Upcoming decks/archetypes that will make a splash (cards from the upcoming Judgment of the Light and Shadow Specters set)

* Bujin
* BEWD (new structure deck coming)
* Monarchs (new cards 

 -

**Extra Deck**

Current decks run mostly Xyz monsters. Some decks still run Synchro monsters. Here is a list of some of the most popular generic cards, by rank:

Rank 2

* Gachi Gachi Gantetsu
* Daigusto Phoenix (thanks metallicrooster!)

Rank 3:  

* Leviair, the Sea Dragon  
* Number 17: Leviathan Dragon  
* Number 20: Giga-Brilliant  
* Number 30: Acid Golem of Destruction  
* Wind-Up Zenmaines
* Temtempo the Percussion Djinn

Rank 4:
  
* Daigusto Emeral (HA07)
* Maestroke the Symphony Djinn  
* Number 39, Utopia  
* Number C39, Utopia Ray  
* Steelswarm Roach  
* Lavalval Chain (HA07)
* Number 16 Shock Master
* Photon Papilloperative
* Number 50: Blackship of Corn
* Gagaga Cowboy
* Abyss Dweller

Rank 5:  

* Adreus, Keeper of Armageddon  
* Number 61: Volcasaurus 
* Tiras, Keeper of Genesis  
* Wind-Up Arsenal Zenmaioh  

Rank 6:

* Photon Strike Bounzer

Synchros:

* Stardust Dragon
* Black Rose Dragon
* Ally of Justice Catastor


When making your Extra Deck, be sure to check for type/attribute/deck-specific Xyz monsters your deck is able to summon, such as **Evolzar Dolkka** and **Evolzar Laggia** in Dino Rabbit, and **Blade Armor Ninja** and **Heroic Champion Excalibur** in any deck that includes a variety of Level 4 Warrior monsters.

It is a good idea to include a few good synchro monsters such as **Ally of Justice Catastor**, ~~**Brionac, Dragon of the Ice Barrier**~~, **Black Rose Dragon**,  **Stardust Dragon**, and **Mist Wurm**, even if your deck isn't focused on synchro summons; at times you may find performing one with **Effect Veiler** or a Reborned Tuner monster may win you the game or give you an upper hand.

 -

**Side Deck** (side decks are always changing with meta. Some of these are to deal with today's meta decks)

* Dimensional Fissure
* Dimensional Prison
* Dust Tornado
* Kycoo the Ghost Destroyer
* Maxx ""C""

* Snowman Eater
* Soul Taker

So far you guys have been awesome about keeping fake lists out and let's keep it up. 


So if you think you have a real banlist, you probably don't. ""Scans"" are very easy to fake and there are two places you can go to find the real list once it is confirmed. These two websites are listed below.

Last year they jumped the gun on posting the list, however, it ended up being the correct one. Anything posted on this website is more or less confirmed to be true.

So, this deck has 3 main things. Slifer, Mecha Phantom Beasts, and Black Garden. A crazy combo I'd never seen before. I saw a comment in the best god card thread about Slifer and Black Garden, but how to get him out? That's where the air force came in. Since Mecha Phantom Beasts are so token-based, Black Garden actually helps them a lot. The instant my opponent summons a monster, Black Garden will protect my planes, if they haven't done that already.

With all the tokens and planes flying around, it'll easily get me 3 monsters, usually 5, and I can summon Slifer the normal way. No pesky Ophion in my way. Then the fun begins. Because now the game shifts to Slifer. Now, unless my opponent pulls a magic Blue Eyes Ultimate Dragon out of nowhere, Black Garden will cut it down to under 2000, where Slifer will destroy it, and I'll get another token for my planes. Then, I rain hell from the skys.

*************************

Here is a compilation post taken from other threads, my own/other redditor's input, as well stuff taken from Yugioh wiki. I'll try to clean up posts as well (with credit of course):

**So what exactly has changed?**

**In 2008, a new type and way of summoning was introduced called Synchro Summoning:**

""During your Main Phase 1 or 2, when the total Level of a face-up Tuner monster and 1 or more face-up Non-Tuner monster(s) you control is exactly the Level of a Synchro Monster in your Extra Deck, you can perform a Synchro Summon. These Tuner monster and the non-Tuner monster(s) will be called the Synchro Material Monsters.

In order to Synchro Summon a Synchro Monster from your Extra Deck (under normal conditions), you must declare the action and send the Synchro Material Monsters to the Graveyard. After sending the monsters from your side of the field to the Graveyard, you then take the Synchro Monster from your Extra Deck and place it in face-up Attack Position or Defense Position on your side of the field.""

Example of a synchro monster: http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Stardust_Dragon

**In 2011, another way of summoning called XYZ (pronounced ik-seez) Summoning was introduced:**

Xyz Summons can be conducted when there are two or more monsters of the same Level on your side of the field. Those monsters can be used as Xyz Materials to Summon an Xyz Monster whose Rank is the same as the Levels of the monsters used.

In order to Xyz Summon an Xyz Monster, you must first take the required Xyz Materials face-up on your side of the field and stack them together (called overlaying in the anime). Then, the Xyz Monster is Xyz Summoned from your Extra Deck, and placed on top of the stack.

Xyz Materials are not sent to the Graveyard. Instead, they are placed on the same Monster Card Zone beneath the Summoned Xyz Monster.

The respective battle positions of the Xyz Materials do not matter, so long as they are all face-up. However, once you have Xyz Summoned your Xyz Monster, ensure that the entire stack is neatly aligned in face-up attack position, regardless of whether or not the Xyz Monster is summoned in face-up ATK or DEF position.

An Xyz Summon is a type of Special Summon, and an Xyz Monster is a Special Summon-only monster.

Some effects may require you to remove Xyz Materials from an Xyz Monster. In this case, the required Xyz Materials are taken from beneath the Xyz Monster in question and sent to the Graveyard. This is known as detaching. Be wary though, as some such effects may have a downside if an Xyz Monster has no Xyz Materials left beneath it.

Note that an Xyz Monster Special Summoned via any means other than an Xyz Summon (except for Xyz Reborn) will not have any Xyz Materials beneath it. Therefore, any negative effects that might apply to an Xyz Monster in such a state will be applied immediately.

If an Xyz Monster is flipped face-down, the Xyz Materials beneath it are not sent to the Graveyard.

If a card that would banish cards sent to the graveyard (such as ""Macro Cosmos"" or ""Banisher of the Radiance"") is in effect, when an Xyz Monster is destroyed/removed from the field the Xyz Materials beneath it are banished. However if an effect that would banish a monster(s) on the field (like ""Dimensional Fissure"") is activated, only the Xyz Monster will be affected. The Materials used will be sent to the Graveyard.

Example of an XYZ Monster: http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Number_39%3A_Utopia

Tier 1: E. Dragon, Prophecy

Tier 1.5: Evilswarm

Tier 2: Tempest Dragunity

Other good, semi-budget deck options:  

* Agents

* Bujin
* BEWD (new structure deck coming)
* Monarchs (new support coming soon)
* Ghostricks

 -

**Extra Deck**

Current decks run mostly Xyz monsters. Some decks still run Synchro monsters. Here is a list of some of the most popular generic cards, by rank:

Rank 2

* Gachi Gachi Gantetsu
* Daigusto Phoenix 

Rank 3:  

* Leviair, the Sea Dragon  
* Number 17: Leviathan Dragon  
* Number 20: Giga-Brilliant  
* Number 30: Acid Golem of Destruction  
* Wind-Up Zenmaines
* Temtempo the Percussion Djinn

Rank 4:
  
* Daigusto Emeral 
* Maestroke the Symphony Djinn  
* Number 39, Utopia  
* Number C39, Utopia Ray  
* Steelswarm Roach  
* Lavalval Chain 
* Number 16 Shock Master
* Photon Papilloperative
* Number 50: Blackship of Corn
* Gagaga Cowboy
* Abyss Dweller

Rank 5:  

* Adreus, Keeper of Armageddon  
* Number 61: Volcasaurus 
* Tiras, Keeper of Genesis  
* Wind-Up Arsenal Zenmaioh  

Rank 6:

* Photon Strike Bounzer
* Constellar Ptolemys M7
* Gauntlet Launcher

Rank 7:

* Number 11: Big Eye
* Gaia Dragon, the Thunder Charger
* Mecha Phantom Beast Dracossack

Synchros:

* Stardust Dragon
* Black Rose Dragon
* Ally of Justice Catastor
* Crimson Blader


When making your Extra Deck, be sure to check for type/attribute/deck-specific Xyz monsters your deck is able to summon, such as **Evolzar Dolkka** and **Evolzar Laggia** in Dino Rabbit, and **Blade Armor Ninja** and **Heroic Champion Excalibur** in any deck that includes a variety of Level 4 Warrior monsters.

It is a good idea to include a few good synchro monsters such as **Ally of Justice Catastor**,, **Black Rose Dragon**,  **Stardust Dragon**, and **Mist Wurm**, even if your deck isn't focused on synchro summons; at times you may find performing one with **Effect Veiler** or a Reborned Tuner monster may win you the game or give you an upper hand.

**Side Deck** (side decks are always changing with meta. Some of these are to deal with today's meta decks)

* Dimensional Fissure
* Dust Tornado

**Side Deck**

To be decided :'(

------------------------------

I like Ritual monsters and I love Fusion monsters, and in fact until Madolche came out my maindecks have always included Fusion monsters.  So I asked myself: ""Why not combine the two?""

This deck does all of the typical Gem-Knight stuff; which is to say drop a whole lot of fusion monsters and drop your entire hand doing so.  The first part I really enjoy the second part I really don't.  So I tried to circumvent this by including cards that aided me in fixing my hand while also taking advantage of all the normal monsters I have to run.  

Now **Gem-Knight Fusion** is already an incredibly abusive card for the archetype.  By including **Reshef the Dark Being** I've taken that abuse to criminal levels by turning it into a **Change of Heart** as well.

I've come across times where I do have completely dead hands  but I think that's more my luck (open 6 normal Gem-Knights draw two more and then **Rescue Rabbit**).  I'm looking to fix this through a slight change in tech, but on the whole I think this deck is complete.

I'm still trying to work on side deck choices I best think would help so I haven't included that in this deck profile.

Now this may take some time and organization, but with some help, I think that this can become a really fun reality!  What I had in mind was a yugioh league, with players, casters, and analysts.

If this is something that interests you at ANY LEVEL please comment on/upvote this post!  I think it'd be a great way to have some fun with this awesome communtiy.

A lot of them seem very basic but newer players especially have trouble grasping some of them. Feel free to share any rulings that frequently come up in your games!

- If you set a quickplay spell you cannot activate it until your opponents turn

- If you respond to an attack declaration with Threatening Roar the attack still goes through since it has already been declared. Also, if that monster is Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning and destroys a monster by battle he still gets his second attack because it is an effect

- If you chain Forbidden Dress to Dimensional Prison, Dimensional Prison still resolves since it targets at activation and does not destroy

- If Heavy Storm (or any other mass destruction card) is destroyed before an activated Starlight Road resolves, the player who activated Starlight Road does not get to special summon Stardust Dragon because Starlight Road needs to negate and destroy the card it is chained to in order to resolve the second part of it's effect

- Only counter traps or spell speed 2 cards/effects that alter attack/defense or negate card/effect activations can be activated in the damage step (unless specifically stated ie: Gorz)

- Solemn Warning cannot be used on Geartown at any time (spell activation or activation of it's effect when it is destroyed)

- Starlight Road cannot be chained to the effect of Elemental Hero Stratos or similar effects

- Monsters who have *optional* effects that activate *when* they are summoned will not get their effects if you chain Call of the Haunted targeting them to an opponent's Mystical Space Typhoon due to missing the timing",,False,self,t5_2rpe6,1363638792.0,,wind,True,t3_1ajc3n,http://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/comments/1ajc3n/just_some_rulings_not_everyone_seems_to_know/,

I’ve noticed a lot of rage on this subreddit recently, especially after the march banlists. Wind-ups and insectizors blow playing against. If you use them, you’re cheap, you are buying your wins, and it takes no thought, blah blah blah. I think what’s happening is the game is shifting to a different style of gameplay, and we’re upset because we hate change. Some points I think we should know:

1.	Konami is a corporation. “they don’t game about balance” “they just want money”. Guess what? The sole objective of any corporation is to make as much profit as possible for the benefit of their employees, and shareholders. With this in mind, Konami has to release new material that you want to buy. For example, to keep making a profit, Konami has to turn out booster packs/structure decks/reprints people want. If Konami releases a weak archtype that gets crushed by everything else currently played, who’s going to buy it? They have to add cards so people will buy them. Banifish in GenF sucked. To compensate, they added XYZ monsters. Photon shockwave’s evol and photon arch-types are also pretty weak. They added more XYZ, introduced Rescue rabbit. ORCS gave us ninja’s which are cool, but they also gave us insectizors and wind-ups. Would you buy gen force if it just had fish in it? The “OP” cards are added as secret rares to make you want to buy them. I think why this upsets us is because these strong cards are introduced and not all of us have access to them financially.

2.	Cards too strong, or too consistent? Before the release of the Dark world structure deck, no one played DW’s. They existed for quite some time before the release, but only after Snoww and Grapha were released, did peoplecomplain of their power. Less than a few months later, we’ve accepted them as alright. Not tier 0, but still competitive. Why? Because the release of DW was a slow process to build up their viability, and then when the key cards were released, everyone had access to them. You can get the key card for dark worlds for a buck each. This gets you physically strong, and consistent cards. If you block the effect of Grapha, it’s still a 2700 beat stick you can use. Tour guide and rescure rabbit, not so much.

3.	“But wind-ups and insectizors can beat you first turn. It’s too consistent. Who cares about attack?” I feel like our anger towards these cards stems from the fact that **They get to play their deck however they want, and we don’t**. I want to build my six sam deck purely supporting six sams with staple defensive cards. Wind-ups want to build their decks purely supporting wind-ups. On average, the wind-ups are going to beat me. Know what I have to do then? I have to build my deck around expecting to play against wind-ups.

4.	“But that’s not fair.” What the hell do you mean that’s not fair? That fucker just dropped half a grand on some cardboard. You think you deserve to play your 30 buck deck and get the same results? Bullshit. If you want to invest more time and money into your hobby, then I expect you to be able to beat me. I’m sorry. Disagree if you want.

5.	We fucking hate side-decking. When we play on the DN we want to play 1 game, win, and then play someone else. 1 match is the best 2/3 for a reason. If I side deck properly, I can lose the first game, but sweep the last two with ease. 

6.	This meta isn’t focused on your main deck anymore. Think about it. Each deck you make will only be on the top for so long. Insectizors are strong. All I have to do to beat them, though, is stall a turn with 1 eff veiler, solemn, etc. and next turn shadow imprisoning mirror. I take 5 cards to leave only 35 I wanted in the first place, to absolutely shut down their 40. All of it. Tiger king shuts down wind-ups because when it comes to attack, they’re weak as fuck. Thunder king stops any searching and can negate special summons. How many times has he been reprinted, recently? Eff veiler getting reprinted too? It’s almost as if Konami realizes how strong these new archtypes are, and wants to give you more access to give you more of a fighting chance.


TL;DR: We need to adapt. I ran straight 6 sams for a while until I pulled a super polymerization from the legendary collection. Plants were very popular and in 1 turn you were usually looking at a very powerful synchro dragon that was tough to remove. I thought to myself, “hey, I can use their synchro, my warrior, and this card, and it can’t be stopped. What if they didn’t use one? Well, what other fusion cards could I add to make super poly not a dead draw? By adding alius and stratos to my six sam deck, I have access to extremely powerful fusion E hero cards. My six sams are of every attribute, so I have access to the shining, absolute zero, etc. Hell, with my swarming ability, I found out d hero plasma was extremely easy to get out, negates effect monsters on the field, and yoinks them away like the god-damned relinquished. Our staple cards are shifting, our playstyles are shifting. Our mind-set has to as well.

(please leave feedback on the video if you watch!)

So the topic I'm asking r/yugioh today is what you guys think of the lack of a solid source for finding and citing rulings. Sure, there are judges. Sure, there are Dueling Network admins. But there doesn't seem to be any particular source in writing to find solid, official rulings. Things get further complicated when you consider that sometimes different judges in different areas will rule scenarios differently.

I remember that we used to have netrep, a source that a lot of people trusted. However, with it having gone down, and Wikia being a heavily debated source, we're left mainly with forums and the Adjudication facebook group (which even specifies that it's not a source, but rather a discussion portal). 

Where do you guys all go for rulings? And how about at your local shops? Do the judges go somewhere specifically, or do they use their own knowledge? What happens when a ruling is contested? 

I feel like this a major issue, and it has been for quite a while. Since many of the newer cards already stretch the rules sometimes, it's even more relevant. Plus, we've got the North America WCQ coming up.

So what are you guys' opinions? Open discussion in the comments with thoughts and maybe even suggestions for solving this problem!

1362059704.0,41,self.yugioh,19e8i3,Going Gagaga - A Gaga-Guide,50,9,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/comments/19e8i3/going_gagaga_a_gagaguide/,"With apologies for the awful pun, everybody's getting on board the deck guide bandwagon, so I figured I'd join in with my favourite archetype. I've been running gagagas since Gagagarevenge came out in REDU and made them useable, and while they're not the strongest deck in the game, they're extremely versatile and capable of some big surprises.

One interesting (and marginally annoying) thing about Gagagas is that the archetype is effectively split into two discreet strategies that don't have great synergy with one another. The spellcaster-type gagagas tend to work well with gagaga magician, while the warrior types tend to work well with gagaga caesar. To clear up the distinction, I'll be explaining both deck types, the caesar variant in a later post. Now without further ado:

**Radio Gagaga**

**Introduction**

This is the Gagaga Magician build. it focuses on toolboxing with rank 3-8 xyzs (you can run 1s and 2s, but there aren't really any with effects that aren't done better by bigger monsters). The strategy is dead simple - Get gagaga magician and another monster on the field and xyz for whatever you need right now. Actually figuring out what you need is up to you.

Strategy typically involves getting your gagaga magician and gagaga girl into your hand or graveyard, then using gagagarevenge, gagagawind, or monster reborn to get them both out and XYZ summon. Before you have this setup, you're going to need to stall, though on the bright side this gives you a good look into your opponent's deck and insight on how it runs. From there, you can turn your opponent's strategy on its head and use it to help you fulfill your own win conditions, or simply lock them down and chip away until you win.

*Pros* 

* No really good or bad matchups. Can respond to almost anything with proper strategy
* Can turn the game around easily once you know your opponent's deck. Really strong in mid-long games.
* Packs some big surprises and a potential two-card OTK just by running the way it normally runs.
* Works with chaos monsters. Chaos monsters are always good.

*Cons*

* Can be slow to start. Has a weak early game.
* Makes heavy use of the graveyard and is thus vulnerable to macro cosmos.
* Likewise, can be shut down (though not entirely) by skill drain and shadow imprisoning mirror.
* If you can't get magician and girl out or in the graveyard, you're pretty much screwed.

**The Deck:**

*Monsters:*

**Gagaga Magician** - The heart and soul of the deck. Can change his level to anything you want. The only drawback is that you can only have one on the field, but the other cards in the deck make this a non-issue. **Run 3**

**Gagaga Girl** - Waifu card number 1. If magician is the soul of the deck, this card is the devious brain. Not only can she match magician's level change, allowing for xyzs of any rank, but when you xyz summon with just her and another gagaga as materials, you can reduce the attack of one of your opponent's special summoned monsters to 0. Unlike magican, you can use this card for synchro summons, which can allow for some potential tech choices (although extra deck space will be tight as it is). **Run 3**

**Gagaga Kid** - This adorable little guy comes out in june, at which point the viability of this deck increases exponentially. He's basically a Kizan who can match gagaga magician's level when he's summoned, allowing for first-turn power plays that wouldn't otherwise be possible with the deck. You can't conduct your battle phase the turn you use him, but that's a small price to pay to get something like Strike Bounzer out turn one. **Once he's out, Run 3**

**Summoner Monk** - This deck runs a lot of spells and level 4s, and it's vital to search out Gagaga Magician early. **Run 2**

**Mystic Tomato** - Gagaga Magician and Gagaga Girl are darks under 1500. The math here is easy. Plus this little fruit can stall like a reborn tengu before pulling them out, helping you avoid OTKs and other potential nastiness. **Run 2-3**

**Tour Guide** - Have we circlejerked enough today about missing Sangan? I *really* fuckin' miss sangan. Anyway, obvious utility is obvious. Plus she baits out veilers like a boss, which gives your later plays a greater chance of success. **Run 2, plus other engine cards if you have room**

**Thunder King Rai-Oh** - King of the stun/stall cards, which is great in a slower deck like this. Plus he has a level, so you can XYZ with him. And he's a light monster. This is important. **Run 2**

**Cyber Dragon** - This deck runs a lot of rank 5s, and gagaga magician works wonders with this bad boy. Not to mention Chimeratech Fortress plays, which a lot of people don't expect game 1. Plus, a light monster, and I think you're starting to see where I'm going with this. **Run 2-3**

**Star Drawing** - Easy rank 4 or 5 and turns summoner monk and xyz summons in general into +0s rather than -1s. Unfortunately, made slightly redundant by Gagaga Magician. **Run 0-2**

**Chaos Sorceror** - High level, easy to summon, and packs a great effect. A perfect combo with Gagaga Magician. Banish with him and go into Strike Bounzer or maybe Number 6: Chronomaly Atlandis for further shenanigans. **Run 1**

**Gorz the Emissary of Darkness** - Great for stalling (have I mentioned the deck is a little slow) and easily combos with magician to make big eye. (conveniently, your opponent will probably have a big monster for you to steal if you bring gorz out.) **Run 1**

**Dark Armed Dragon** - A power card, and the deck has just enough grave control to make him kind of reliable. However, there are cards in your extra deck that pull his effect off at less cost, and many darks need to stay in the graveyard in order to keep your toolbox open. Still, a viable option for bringing out big eye. **Run 0-1**

**Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning** Still one of the best single monsters in the game, and you're running enough of a chaos spread to keep him live almost all the time. Plus, at level 8, he falls within the bounds of your toolbox. You can clear out up to 3 card by banishing with his effect and then making Heliopolis, then attack for game. (though most of the time, keeping BLS is preferable) **run 1**

**Tragoedia** - Easy summoning, level changing, and mind control powers - Trag was made for gagagas. unfortunately, the deck tends to neg a lot in making its big plays, so you won't often bring him out at full strength, and using his effect means negging more. **Run 1-2**

**Hand Traps** - mostly a matter of preference whether you main or side these. Maxx C and Veiler are both good here for different reasons, but they take up space. your call.

*Spells*

**Gagagarevenge** - Oh man, this card. A costless premature burial on steroids. Not only does it bring back Gagagas to facilitate XYZ summons, but when you use those monsters for XYZ summons, it pulls a giga-brilliant and boosts every XYZ monster you control by 300 atk (including the one you just summoned). Roach and Strike Bounzer are tough to beat on their own, but that 300 boost can push them into unstoppable territory. Combined with Girl's effect you can beat over almost anything and do some hefty damage to boot. **Run 3.**

**Gagaga Bolt** - Costless spot destruction, with the only restriction being that you need a gagaga on the field. This card is amazing. If this were a quickplay like MST you'd need to run it at 3 always. As it is, **Run 1-2**

**Gagagadraw** - Provides much-needed draw power, but not in the early game when you really need it. Also takes a lot of gagagas out of your graveyard, which can stop the deck dead. Once Kid comes out this problem will be somewhat alleviated, but this is still an iffy card at best **Run 0-2**

**Gagagawind** - Coming in Lord of the Tachyon Galaxy, this card lets you summon any gagaga from your hand and change its level to 4. this is another option for turn one gagaga plays, but it's a -2, which makes it a little tenuous strategically. On the plus side, lets you summon around hidden armory. **Run 1-2 when it comes out**

**Gagagaback** - With a painful cost and a situational effect, this card is rarely worth running, but can keep gagagas on the field for future plays. **Run 0-1**

**Hidden Armory** - Since the deck relies so heavily on Gagaga Revenge to function properly, you need a way to search it out. Hidden Armory is and always has been a stellar card, (not to mention the reason premature burial is banned), as it can search not only the deck, but the graveyard as well. Its cost is paltry (mill one card) and can even help set up your graveyard if you're lucky but the restriction it places on you is hefty - no normal summons or sets the turn you use it. It basically lets you run revenge at 5, though, so it's worth using. **run 2**

**Foolish Burial** - Helps set up revenge plays. Easy choice as fodder for summoner monk **run 1**

**Mind Control** - You can XYZ with literally anything you want, or even steal a rank 5 or 6 with Gaia Dragon the Thunder Charger. **Run 1**

**XYZ Unit** - The deck focuses on xyz monsters and has equip searching ability, so this is a good tech choice. Can buff weak monsters like steelswarm roach up, makes Tiras nearly impossible to get rid of, and gives you an extra use of any XYZ effect **Run 0-1**

**Wonder Wand** - usable for similar reasons to XYZ unit, and can give the deck some much needed draw power, albeit at the cost of a Gagaga. **Run 0-1**

**Spell Wall** - Can protect you if your opponent is running heavy backrow, and could potentially be good if Chain Disappearance becomes more heavily sided. Also has good synergy with gagaga kid since their restrictions overlap, and protects Big Eye should you choose to summon him. **Run 0-2**

**Inferno Reckless Summon** Can set up some pretty crazy plays in combination with Gagaga Revenge and Gagaga girl. **Run 0-1**

**Staples** - Monster Reborn, Dark Hole, Heavy Storm, MST. The usual. Forbidden Lance can also be useful. I advise against running Pot of Duality, despite the slowness of the deck, because if you use it with hidden armory you can end up royally screwing yourself.

*Traps*

**Gagagashield** - Faaaaaaantastic generic spellcaster protection, which will be searchable when they come out with the inevitable archetype searcher (fingers crossed). Protect your gagagas, chaos sorceror, or big eye from destruction by battle or card effect twice in a turn, with no cost. Stops dark hole, Almost always forces your opponent to -1 by dropping MST, or else stops them from OTKing you by making them attack the same monster three times. **Run 2-3 when it drops on March 8th**

**Gagagaguard** Not to be confused with Gagagashield. Generally you won't be leaving your Gagagas on the field for more than one turn, unless girl gets veilered. As a result, this card ends up being pretty useless a lot of the time, especially game 1. Tech at your own risk. **Run 0-1**

**Gagagarush** same as guard logic applies, although this can protect your gagaga cowboy and further burn your opponent. Situational and rarely live. **Run 0-1**

**Magician's Circle** - Probably the best search card in the deck, and the easiest way to get out magician and girl in a single turn. As an added bonus, it forces your opponent to summon an effect veiler from their deck in attack mode, allows you to look through their deck if they claim not to have targets, and grants you a replay as long as it resolves. With priority you can also sneak your summoned monster around mirror force. Just remember to side it out against prophecies. **Run 2-3**

**XYZ Reborn** - This deck XYZ summons a lot, and thus this card is rarely dead. Lets you use dead quick effect monsters like strike bounzer or roach much like trap cards. **Run 0-1**

**Staples** As with almost anything, run the solemn twins. Other stun cards like bottomless, compulsory, and torrential are also valid choices. Since the deck is spell-heavy, and runs a good few hand traps and quick-effect XYZs, I advise keeping it trap-light.

*Extra Deck*

Key cards will be explained. This is a toolbox, so unless otherwise stated, cards are **Run 0-1.** As a rule, you want at least one xyz for each rank between 3 and 8.

*-the essentials-*

**Gagaga Cowboy** - Already a staple pretty much everywhere, he's especially good here, allowing you to pop off gagaga bolt. Also, his burn effect sets up your OTK nicely **Run 1**

**Steelswarm Roach** - Good stun card, easy to get, a lot of decks need to play around it. **Run 1**

**Photon Strike Bounzer** - Same as roach and almost as easy to summon. If your opponent doesn't minus, they take damage. bonus: it's a light monster. **Run 1** 

**Gaia Dragon the Thunder Charger** - Make cheap plays with mind control, recycle a dead Tiras. Pierce for game once you have your opponent on the defensive. This card has a lot of utility here. **Run 1**

**Number 11: Big Eye** - Obscenely useful here. Steal big monsters to XYZ with them or just keep them on the field and run your opponent into the ground with his own cards. As a spellcaster, he can search out your gagagas with Magician's Circle or gain protection from Gagagashield. **Run 1**

**Number 33: Chronomaly Machu Mech** - This is your OTK card. Once your opponent has special summoned a monster bigger than 2800 attack (2650 if you use gagagarevenge, 2400 if you burn with Gagaga Cowboy, 2250 if you can manage both, and a paltry 2000 if you have XYZ unit and revenge), bring out gagaga magician and gagaga girl. XYZ and use girl's effect to reduce the monster to 0 atk, then burn them for their original attack, gain that much attack for machu mech, and attack the 0 atk monster for game. (2800+2400+2800 = 8000). This card can also turn things around on fire fists, noble knights, and other self-boosting archetypes, and wipes the floor with things like dark mist and heroic champion excalibur. Very versatile, very powerful. And a Light Monster, to boot **Run 1**

**Chimeratech Fortress Dragon** - You run cyber dragon, you run this. End of story. **run 1**

**Chronomaly Crystal Chrononaut** or **Number 20: Giga-Brilliant** - More or less your choice here. The important part is not their effects (although both are good) but rather their attribute. If you open with Tour Guide and BLS or Chaos Sorceror, BAM, you have yourself some chaos fodder. **Run 0-1 of either**

*-pick a card, any card-*

**Leviair the Sea Dragon**

**Wind-Up Zenmaines**

**Temtempo the Percussion Djinn**

**Number 30: Acid Golem** (consider this essential if anyone at your locals runs skill drain)

**Number 39: Utopia**

**Number c39: Utopia Ray**

**Photon Papilloperative**

**Maestroke the Symphony Djinn**

**Abyss Dweller**

**Tiras, Keeper of Genesis**

**Adreus, Keeper of Armageddon**

**Number 61: Volcasaurus**

**Wind-Up Arsenal Zenmaioh**

**Empress of Prophecy**

**Number 6: Chronomaly Atlandis**

**Number 25: Force Focus**

**Constellar Ptolemy M7**

**Hieratic Sun Dragon Overlord of Heliopolis**

**Number 40: Gimmick Puppet of Strings**

**Number 22: Zombiestein**

**Number 15: Gimmick Puppet Giant Killer**

*Side Deck Strategy:*

You'll mainly side in the standards of the format - extra MSTs, Hand Traps, Huge Revolution is Over, Soul Taker, Soul Drain, etc. You can also side in extra copies of tech cards, like an extra gagaga bolt, cyber dragon, Tragoedia or gagaga draw. Remember, you want to either stop your opponent's deck from working or stop them from doing the same to you.

One card that I like to side in is Level Limit: Area B. This helps to shut down Atlantean OTKs, fire king and fire fist beatdowns, synchro decks, dark worlds, and a lot of other high-tier decks, and it doesn't affect your gagagas in the slightest.

My only other suggestion would be to use a couple slots in your side to expand your extra deck toolbox. Generally speaking, you don't want to need to do this, but Gagagas do provide you with a lot of options and space in the extra deck is tight. It's your call.",,False,self,t5_2rpe6,1362059892.0,,,True,t3_19e8i3,http://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/comments/19e8i3/going_gagaga_a_gagaguide/,

I had someone come and steal literally everything Yugioh related, including all three decks (Chaos Agents, Watts and Tempest Gusto), mats and binders. No idea who it was, but they took several hundred, maybe even a grand, worth of cards and it basically broke my heart. 

I hope you enjoyed a couple of my guides, sometimes people still PM me questions, which excites me every time. I loved helping in anyway I could and wish I could have been even more helpful.

I don't have the money, or resources to rebuild any of my decks, and to be completely honest I'm only heartbroken about my Tempest Gustos (Watts too, but I stopped playing them), since they were my favorite deck. 

I hope you guys understand and have a great Wednesday.

I would like to direct this letter to the translation/localization team responsible for localizing card names to the TCG.
&gt;
&gt;First things first, I would like to thank you for all the hard work you put into bringing Yugioh to the English speaking world.
&gt;
&gt;However, as you may have expected, I have written this letter because I am dissatisfied with the ""If it ain't broke, break it"" pattern that localizations have taken in nearly every set. There are plenty of Japanese cards with names that were already in English/katakana, but were changed drastically for no visible reason.
&gt;
&gt;Example of a card translation that I (and many others) were displeased with: Photon Papilloperative.
&gt;
&gt;There was no reason to change this card. As far as I can see, ""Photon Butterfly Assassin"" or 「フォトン・バタフライ・アサシン」 did not violate any copyrights, and was a perfectly fine English name. ""Papilloperative,"" on the other hand, has no advantages to ""Butterfly Assassin,"" and the only difference is that ""Papilloperative"" is harder to pronounce."" Even a change to Butterfly Assailant following the pattern of Night Assassin becoming Night Assailant would have worked.
&gt;
&gt;Again with ""Battlin' Boxers."" The original Burning Knucklers was perfectly acceptable English, and made the archetype sound fierce. The main problem with Battlin' Boxers is that it sounds juvenile, with the n-apostrophe sounding especially so. Even though Burning Knuckler may have sounded too similar to Fire Fist, there were an abundance of better, less juvenile-sounding words that could have replaced the name, such as Burning Boxers, Battle Boxers, Battling Boxers, Battle Knuckles, among others.
&gt;
&gt;A more recent case: Star Eater. The card art shows a dragon hatching from a star, not consuming one. On top of that, the name lacks tact in that it seems like whoever came up with the name had no knowledge of connotation. Star Eater sounds awfully similar to Level Eater or Star Changer, both of which are much less fierce cards. Even if one were to ignore the original name 星態龍 (or Celestial Dragon as the fan translation called it), there are more powerful-sounding words. One Reddit user suggested Solar Devourer as an alternative name, which still sounds far better than Star Eater.The name Star Eater leaves far less of a resonant image of a powerful Synchro monster than the other names that fans have suggested.
&gt;
&gt;Try and keep the names loyal to the anime canon if possible. Googly-Eyes Drum Dragon misses the point of sounding like Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon, while Garbagey-Eyes Fat Dragon fits the bill perfectly. A younger player (the supposed target audience) may fail to see the significance of Orbital 7's imitation of Kite's ace monster if it doesn't sound like the original. Essentially, creating consistencies between the anime and the game helps generate more loyal customers who are introduced to Yugioh via Saturday morning television.
&gt;
&gt;However, please do not be discouraged at the examples I have given above, as there are also many cases of very good localization.
&gt;
&gt;I particularly liked the localization of the cards in the Saga of Blue-Eyes Structure Deck, and I thought Azure-Eyes, Blue-Eyes, and Eyes of Blue were a concise and elegant way to distinguish between the three names, 蒼眼, 青眼, and 青き眼. 
&gt;
&gt;Likewise, the choice to keep Bujin mostly untranslated was an excellent call, as it allowed the archetype to keep its flavor.
&gt;
&gt;At the end of the day, what I want to say is: please try to keep the following features in mind when you localize card names:
&gt;Keep the names elegant, concise and easy to pronounce. (More like Azure-Eyes, less like Papilloperative)


&gt;Try and preserve flavor in names. Azure-Eyes Silver Dragon sounds cool because it's a direct upgrade of 
Blue-Eyes White Dragon. Star Eater sounds weak because it sounds like an evolution of Level Eater instead of an iconic Synchro monster like Stardust Dragon.


&gt;If it ain't broke, don't fix it. If it's an English Katakana name in the OCG like Butterfly Assassin or Photon Slayer (AKA Photon Slasher) that doesn't step on any toes, leave it be.
&gt;
&gt;Again, thank you very much for your work, and I hope you can take my suggestions into consideration.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;

&gt;Thanks very much for your time,
&gt;A long-time Yugioh fan.

REDU was earth, ABYR was water, CBLZ was fire, LTGY was wind, JOTL will be light, and SHSP (shadow specters) will be dark. After that, all the attributes will be covered, so what will Konami do next?  
I think they should focus on types next. Not releasing one type per set, but maybe 2-3 types per pack. Like maybe having a set that includes just dinosaurs and reptiles; giving some support to previous archetypes or releasing a new one. And now I'm going to go through what I would do and what I would name each set...I have a lot of time on my hands. I'm going to go by set name first, types in that set, then a note about the set.  

Prehistoric Roar - dinosaur and reptile - jurrac, evolsaur, worm, and/or reptillianne support   

Power Up! - machine and thunder - morphtronic and batteryman support  

Mind over Magic? - pyschic and spellcaster - new psychic archetype  

Primal Instinct - beast, beast-warrior, and winged-beast - glad beast and dragunity support  

Tales of Old - dragon and warrior - noble knight and chaos dragon support  

Heaven and Earth - fairy and rock - rock stun and agent support   

Beyond the Grave - fiend and zombie - infernity support and A FUCKING ZOMBIE ARCHETYPE KONAMI PLEASE *coughs* sorry about that  

Death from the Depths - sea-serpant and fish - banishark and atlantian support  

Boiling Point - pyro and aqua - frog, penguin, laval, volcanic, and/or flamvell support  

Nature's Wrath - insect and plant - naturia support and maybe new archetypes for both  

I don't know, it's just an idea. What do you guys think?  

**tl;dr After Konami is done releasing sets based on attributes, they should do sets based on types.**

What do I do?!,56,14,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/comments/15xhk6/ive_been_scammed_what_do_i_do/,"Alright, /r/yugioh, it's been a while since I've submitted any links or guides but based on what I've been seeing here, this is what you need the most. In this guide, I will explain the steps you need to take to avoid being scammed, avoid damaging someone else's reputation that you think scammed you, and what to do if you actually are scammed.

In addition, I will go over how to avoid getting your things stolen at premier events such as regionals and YCS. 

----------------------------------------------
**I think this jerk stole stuff from me?! What do I do now?!**
-----------------------------------------------

The very first step in determining whether you should take action against another person for scamming should always be calming yourself down and taking a few considerations:

&gt;**1. What time of year is it?**

Around the holiday season and such mail tends to be slower than normal. This is due to the increased volume of mail heading in and out of the postal service. During December, wait at least 3 weeks or so before declaring a scammer.

&gt;**2. How far away does this person live?**

International trades will take longer than normal trades. I've traded with a few Canadians before and UK residents. It usually takes around 2 weeks to get to them. Always always always send with some sort of tracking information. This is how most mail and trades are lost.

&gt;**3. Does this person have good feedback?**

If you go on the feedback page, you'll notice a guy that has 50 positive feedback points and 0 negative. Usually they'll be honest and send back your end of the trade if something happens. Some wont. It is not the responsibility of either person if the mail is lost as long as you took the proper precautions. Mail gets lost from time to time. The USPS is not perfect. This isn't to give scammers ideas on blaming it on the USPS every time though. Which is, again why you should ALWAYS use delivery confirmation.

-----------------------------------------------
**HOW TO AVOID BEING SCAMMED**
-----------------------------------------------

There are definitely plenty of ways to protect yourself. I, personally take these steps myself when I trade on any site.

&gt; **1. Check the feedback thread**

As a rule, the individual with higher feedback gets to send second. This is a reward for being an honest trader. That being said, the more feedback a user has, the more people they've traded with. This means they've done that many trades without scamming a person. As a rule, anyone with 0 feedback should steer clear of anyone else with 0-5 feedback. Stick to the 20+ people. Otherwise, you can either bite the bullet and go on with the trade or buy off-site.

&gt; **2. *ALWAYS* use some form of identification on trades over a $10 value.**

 If you've traded with me, you'll know that I typically reject trades that are under $10 because they aren't worth the postage. That's why I usually send in a bubble mailer and use delivery confirmation on my trades. Bubble mailers are extremely cheap. You can get a pack of 10 small ones at walmart for $6. You may want to complain about the $6 now, but if you end up losing $50 in cards you'll change your tune in a heartbeat. I speak from experience. Besides the added protection from the cards themselves, there is a decreased chance of the envelope getting lost in the mail. As for delivery confirmation, it's 80 cents. Not even twice the price of normal postage. I cannot speak for UK or Canadian residents unfortunately. So, on average you'll be spending $1.00~ on trades. Aaron Carver knows a website where you can buy bubble mailers very cheap. Go bother him about it if you want to save even more cash. 

The extra 50 cents for added security will benefit you if it does get lost or stolen. You can file mail fraud against someone if you end up getting scammed. Without delivery confirmation, you cannot verify that the other end got your cards and you can't prove anything to the government. It's safer, it's smarter, it's not that expensive. Just do it.

&gt; **3. Be aware of the trader's attitude and deals.**

 If the trader is rude to other people in his or her thread, don't trade with them. It'll discourage rudeness and at the same time it may possibly prevent scams. Also be sure to note the other ""deals"" they give to people. If you think a trade is too good to be true, it probably is. Unless you get a very desperate, very trustworthy trader; you won't be getting a Mermail Abyssmegalo for that Mokey Mokey. Just be aware.


&gt; **4. Never send ""at the same time"".** 

Most of the threads I've noticed complaining about scammers are those who sent at the same time. Always agree who's sending what first. You may be in a hurry to get the cards before regionals next week, but is it worth losing out on $100 worth of cards?

-----------------------------------------------

I wouldn't recommend sending cash in an envelope, concealed or not. I know a lot of you do it but it's very sketchy. If you use a program like paypal, the transaction shows up and is documented. Cash isn't. You don't have to take this as law. I just don't recommend it. It might also be illegal to send cash over USPS so you might want to check into it.

---------------------------------------------

Okay so, I think I got scammed. What do I do now?

With every trade you should have the PMs from the deal. Don't confirm the deal in your trade thread. Confirm it in PMs. Trade posts can be edited. Message the other user and ask if they've sent out your end. It's always good to wait at least 25 to 30 days to tell if you've been scammed. If the person does not reply to you after 2 days, it's safe to assume they've screwed you over. Check their post history and check their feedback again to see if they've been online and making other trades. If you aren't the only one with problems then you can assume that things went south. Contact a mod about it and have them message the individual. Make a link asking others that have traded with this person if they've had the same problem. Be polite and respectful. Swearing, name-calling, and a bad attitude will not help your case. I know being scammed sucks. It's happened to me too. 

-----------------------------------------------

**So I've definitely been scammed. Now what?**

If you've taken the steps above, the next step is to get the scammer's name and address onto the feedback thread. Once that's taken care of you can threaten to file for mail fraud. If you get no response then it's time to take action. Go to the site listed below and follow the online steps. Unfortunately there's no guarantee that anything will happen and you will get your stuff back. You'll have to cut your losses and move on. Be more cautious in the future. If enough people file against an individual, action will be taken.

**Mail fraud form:**

https://postalinspectors.uspis.gov/forms/mailfraudcomplaint.aspx

--------------------------------------

**Someone accused me of scamming them, what do I do?**

Assuming you didn't actually rip them, all you have to do is show the delivery confirmation form that you should have placed on your item. If they were to send first then they should show that you received their end. If neither side can produce facts then there's no way to tell who is telling the truth. Always be courteous and respectful. Never swear or call names. Again, that will not help your case. The facts will prevent themselves. No action should ever be taken against a user without sufficient evidence. 

--------------------------------------------

**That's all fine and dandy. How to I protect myself offline?**

Stuff gets stolen at regionals all the time. Here's what you do to stay safe!

&gt; **1. Bring friends**

Friends are the best thing in the world aside from a mint condition 1st ed IOC BLS. All joking aside, the more eyes you have at an event the better. Offer a friend a soda or something to watch your stuff for you between rounds.

&gt; **2. Don't bring more than you're willing to lose**

If you can't live without it, don't bring it. You don't need all 50 of your blinged out Mermail decks at regionals. All you need is your deck, side-deck, extra-deck, a deck box, an extra pair of sleeves, and whatever money you need for food. If you want to bring a trade binder then that's perfectly fine. Just don't pack everything into it.

&gt; **3. Don't take your eyes off of your things**

Obviously you want to stay focused on your game and that's where you'll get jacked. Easiest thing to do is NEVER put your bag behind you, under you, across the table from you, or in another room. If you need your bag off of the table, tie the strap around your leg. If you use a drawstring bag, wrap it somewhere safe ON YOUR BODY. This is so that if someone tries to open or grab it, you'll feel it happen. Never leave your deck unattended. I know you're excited to see the pairings for the next round. Just don't forget your deck on the table.

---------------------------------

If you find yourself missing something then you're not entirely out of luck. Talk to people around you and see if they noticed anything. I know a guy whose had binders stolen from them at premier events and he got enough evidence to get his stuff back (with a little bonus due to the theif using the stolen binder as his own). 

------------------------------------------

That's all I have for you right now. Take these easy steps to prevent yourself from losing out. I'd like to request this to be in the side-bar and it would be nice to have a heading for trading information to make the feedback thread, and etiquette thread more visible. All in all if you stay smart and do a bit of research and put 50 more cents into your packaging budget you'll end up losing a lot less.

This post will be about the user COoL_COoKiE (hereafter known as Cookie because that capitalization is confusing as all hell.)

Anyway, like we YGO players are known to do, Cookie and I set up a little trade. His Ultimate Enishi for my Super Shock Master. I dropped the card in a white envelope, slapped on a stamp, and forgot about the trade until his end came in. Excitedly, I opened the envelope, only to find [this](http://imgur.com/Q5aRbk8). 

Yep, it's an Ultra and not an Ultimate. I've gotta say, I was a little disappointed, but hey, it's a $1 difference. I let Cookie know about the mistake, expecting that we'd probably just swap back and call it a day. Much to my surprise, he apologized profusely and said he'd make it right. 

I didn't know exactly what he meant until a week later when I got another letter from him. I'll try to let some pictures I took do most of the talking.

Not only did Cookie make the trade right by getting the Shock Master back to me, he also 1) let me keep the Enishi 2) gave me extra cards 3) gave me money 4) gave me his favorite pokemon card. [Here's a summary picture I took.](http://imgur.com/rPPhYJ5)

Anyway, I just wanted to let you all know that Yugioh still has plenty of great people, despite all the bad news about rippers and thieves you hear all the time. Cookie took responsibility, personalized the exchange, and made a lasting impression on me (and I hope some others, too!)

Thanks, dude!

The reason is because I lost every single card I had collected since the game came out. My family and I were moving a few years ago, and on this clear and beautiful day, my luck ran out. A rainstorm came from absolutely no where, and of course, my cards were in the back of a truck. All of my collection was ruined by the time the truck had arrived. Needless to say, I was a bit depressed. 

Through this time, I have stayed fluent with the rules, banlists, new cards, and other things. But, even through that, I never started to buy cards again. However, a few weeks ago, our fellow r/yugioh member, ixeres, posted a massive trade binder that genuinely impressed me. I commented on his Cyber Dragons, proclaiming my love for the card. I also went on to say I never got my hands on the card before my collection went up in water. He told me to message him, saying maybe we could work something out. Okay...did not expect that. Interest now piqued, I did just that.

He and I talked for a bit and I told him my tale of what happened. After a few messages, he tells me he is not just sending me a single card, but what he called a ""Yugioh care package"". The look on my face must have resembled that of a kid on Christmas morning mixed with that of someone who is lost in the wilderness. I was not expecting it at all, and I just want to tell ixeres yet again, thank you. When I receive the package, I will post pictures.

During our conversation, he said some things to convince me to start buying again. Today, I did just that. I managed to gather up some money, and with it, got two packs of Cosmo Blazer and three of Abyss Rising. I was so happy with just my rares I was pulling, even a couple of Supers. Then, I opened the last pack to find a secret rare Spellbook Library of the Heliosphere. I lost my shit. Getting a secret in my first purchase was the icing on the cake. 

So, I just wanted to tell my story of the past few weeks and how today made me feel like I did many years ago when I opened my first Legend of Blue-Eyes pack. Also, to thank not only ixeres, but this whole subreddit for keeping me interested in the game this whole time.

1369663189.0,42,self.yugioh,1f4xv9,Deck Checks and Why You Shouldn't Be Mad at the Judge: Norcross Regional Judge Report,51,9,48,http://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/comments/1f4xv9/deck_checks_and_why_you_shouldnt_be_mad_at_the/,"Hey guys! This is part Regional report, part talk about Deck Checks. At this past Georgia Regional, I was Deck Check Team Lead; that is, I led all the deck checks for the event. I'm on Deck Team often; I love doing it. I'd like to think I'm pretty good at my job, which is to make sure a) no cards are marked and b) the deck-list and the deck contents are identical. It wouldn't seem to be particularly stressful job, considering I got to sit for half the day while the rest of the judges were on their feet mostly. However, as mad as you players get when I come back to give you a game-loss, I'm equally frustrated as a judge when I have to give a penalty.

**I do not like giving out warnings. I do not like giving out game-losses. I try to be player-friendly when I can.**

As a Deck Check Lead, I rolled dice/had judges pick random numbers all day to decide which decks we would do. Sometimes, a player's name came up twice. We purposefully did not choose to do certain players multiple times, because that would seem biased. However, by the end of the day, we covered a good majority of the top tables (1-20) and had already checked most of them. That's good. That reassures to me that little if no deck cheating was going on, as far as I was aware. These checks were random, and I sent an inconspicuous teammate out to collect the decks. I tend to stand out as a female judge, whereas the guys can kind of blend in. 

So how it works: Team Lead sends the team members to get the decks. They wait until the players have presented their decks to each other, then step in to take the decks. They ask the players to put the entire contents of their decklist (main, side, extra) into their boxes, and then they bring it back to the table where we work. I've already pulled out the deck-list by then, from where we have them sorted alphabetically. Quickly, we sort by spells/traps/monsters, verify and confirm contents. Afterwards, we check for things like marked sleeves and marked cards, with a variety of methods, including but not limited to: thumbing the top of the deck to make sure no sleeves are longer than they should be, performing a drop test to identify possible problem cards, looking at the deck from the side to see if a card pops out, etc, etc. 

Most deck-checks, there are no problems. However, sometimes, things go wrong, players get mad.

I had one situation at Norcross where I suspected the player had left his deck in his car, resulting in 10-12 cards being clearly identifiable from the rest of the deck, due to them heat-warping. 6 of the cards were very high money cards. I lamented; how am I supposed to go tell this player that he has 3 minutes to replace ~700$ in cards? I had two other judges perform their own checks, and they had the same results that I had. I talked it over with the head judge **before** I went to talk to the player, and the HJ confirmed with me that I needed to give him 3 minutes to find replacements. I bandied about the idea of letting him use proxies, but it wasn't possible. Bearer of bad news, the player was obviously not too happy to hear me tell him that.

But that's just the thing; at some point, when the judge is giving you a game-loss for forgetting to side, or telling you to stop spectating and back up, or telling you to take your drinks off the table, you have to realize: **we're just doing our job, and I'm trying my hardest to make sure everyone has fun at the tournament**. Our job is to make the event enjoyable and fair for all players involved. I know it wasn't fair to the player with the marked cards to have to replace them so soon, but it also wasn't fair to his opponent to have his opponent have marked cards. Consider that before you get angry next time a judge tells you that you need to buy a new pack of sleeves.

**TL;DR: Judging can be painful for us too. I hate giving out game-losses and warnings, but sometimes it is necessary to keep the tournament smooth and running. Deck Checks are a necessary evil.**",,False,self,t5_2rpe6,1369664738.0,,wind,True,t3_1f4xv9,http://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/comments/1f4xv9/deck_checks_and_why_you_shouldnt_be_mad_at_the/,

Today I want to tell you guys about an idea I have had and been considering for a couple weeks. It starts with Konami's apparent lack of support for the game. It seems apparent that they don't seem to care too much about YCS coverage and so on. MTG usually has someone streaming their big tournaments with live updates everywhere you can get em. With Yu-Gi-Oh! it seems that relying on people at the event is the best way for immediate coverage! 

But that's only the reason that sparked this idea. I'm not saying we make our own banlist to play by that'd be silly. Konami is a corporation with the only goal in mind is to make profit. They will release broken sets and seemingly unfair banlists if that's what it takes for them to make some cash.

Konami isn't the devil, we shouldn't hate them, they've done nothing wrong. Let me just get straight to the idea. Streamed and casted online tournaments starting here on /r/yugioh. It would be similar to regionals or even a YCS if it grows enough. I'd stream and cast on Twitch along with a co-caster if need be. We'd use TCG cards and rulings and we'd run it on Dueling Network. Brackets won't be hard to setup and it would be a strict tournament date (exactly like a regional/YCS) if you can't come, catch the next one! I'd love to do this for the community and see if we can't get us some awesome, potentially meta-defining tournaments going. There is only one issue with casting the games and that is at the moment my headset picks up a little bit of white noise. It is somewhat faint but until I can order a proper casting microphone, stand, etc. (roughly $120) it will have to do. I also need to learn some of the combos that Mermails and Spellbook do. I've just gotten back into the game after a 5ish month break but I should be able to pick up quickly on them by playing them on DN and watching videos on YouTube, thus allowing me to cast them more effectively.

EDIT: To anyone who thinks it's someone affiliated with YGOPro, DevPro, etc. *Yes*, this would create a temporary boost in traffic to Devpro but if it *is* really them, it would cause a huge backlash/outcry in the community. Maybe Seto and the rest of the YGOPro/DevPro admins have the balls to pull something off like this but I doubt it would benefit them in the long run.

EDIT 2: [A Devpro admin](http://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/comments/1ct3qw/big_news_concerning_dueling_network/c9k2xw9) has released an official statement claiming that the attack is not endorsed or sponsored in any way by DevPro.",,False,self,t5_2rpe6,1366606410.0,,water,True,t3_1ct3qw,http://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/comments/1ct3qw/big_news_concerning_dueling_network/,

""YCS Toronto Boycott

I never thought I would write an article about something like this but alas here I am just a mere month before YCS Toronto with an endless stream of thoughts and emotions. For those of you who are not aware, and there very well may be readers out there who are not, there will be a YCS held in Toronto at the end of this month. It was officially listed on the premier event page of the Yu-Gi-Oh website a few days ago, along with the YCS in San Mateo. It has caused quite a significant uproar in the Yu-Gi-Oh community for an array of different issues, and today I feel as though it is time for us as a community to put our foot down and make a statement.

Before I get too far into the topic at hand, I need to make something absolutely clear. This article has no relation to the recent development between Konami and Alter Reality Games. While I may in fact be a weekly writer for ARG, the sentiments I am about to express are not necessarily that of ARG. The fact that ARG is no longer an affiliated Konami store, and the controversy surrounding the ARG Opens, was not the motivation for writing this article. I had intended on writing this article if YCS Toronto was announced weeks before the boiling point in the Konami negotiations. It just happens to be a coincidence.

I honestly try to sit down each and every week and produce articles which are beneficial to the Yu-Gi-Oh community in a wide variety of manners. Sometimes we talk about individual cards, analyze successful decks, or even on a lucky day end up discussing some of the advanced concepts that are prevalent in the game of Yu-Gi-Oh. This article does not follow that line of thinking. Though that not is to say that what I am about to write is not beneficial to our community. This may be the most important articles I have ever written for the community, or it could simply fizzle out. But I really do hope what I am about to say can pick up steam amongst our community because if there was ever a time to make a statement about the health of the Yu-Gi-Oh card game, today is that day.

So with that being said, I am writing the community today to call a boycott of YCS Toronto 2013. Konami has continued to manipulate the Yu-Gi-Oh community, and failed to address the wholesome complaints of its customers for too many years. It is beyond ludicrous to think that a professionally run trading card game can sit down and believe they have the ability to announce competitive events in the way in which Konami has just. With less than four weeks before round one of YCS Toronto Konami honestly believes that their player based will be able to find an affordable and appropriate means of travel to the event. Unfortunately we do not live in the fantasy world where last minute travel arrangements produce the prices that Konami must think. By scheduling an event with this short of notice, the bulk of players are unable to find the same priced hotels and transportation in which they would have been able to obtain had Konami appropriately announced their event months in advance. Beyond that, seeing as how they decided to announce an event out of the United States at such a last minute, players who would have originally enjoyed the opportunity to travel outside of the United States to play must already have a passport - or otherwise be forced to pay an increased sum of money for an express produced passport. It is beyond unprofessional for a company with the revenue and experience in organized play to believe they even have the right to abuse their players in this manner. Companies who openly appreciate their players, such as Wizards of the Coast, give their players more than adequate time to plan their trips in accordance with what is affordable and fit appropriately in their lives. It is almost as though Konami lives in their own world and ignores the fact that their player base actually have jobs and cannot simply drop what is going on in their lives in order to book a last minute flight and take time off of work. At most establishments of employment, a weekend off to Toronto would have already needed to be requested. So not only are we as players expected to pay more on travel expenses, we are supposed to obtain an express passport, ask for time off of work at what very well may be too short of time, and not know what format we are about to play in.

That is right. Konami has officially announced an event where there will be a fundamental change in the Forbidden and Limited List when the players amass for Day 2. With this glaring issue, a professional company such as Wizards of the Coast would give their players an idea what they are about to invest their hard earned money in going to. Seeing as how we are dealing with an unprofessional company like Konami, they have failed to officially declare what type of tournament their player base would even go to. So now not only are all of the limitations discussed previously an issue in attending the event, you could very well show up to an event where you would have had no intentionally of originally playing. Who knows, maybe Day 1 is Battle Pack 2 sealed. Maybe it is the March 1, 2013 Forbidden and Limited List. Another tournament for Dragon Ruler and Prophecy. I know I personally have no intention of ever playing that format again, and I bet I am not the only one who believes that. So why in the world would you want to invest your money in going to play another competitive tournament under that list? What if it is the September 1st, 2013 list? That would be exciting. How difficult if it to list what format the event is being held under? Such as simplistic decision which any properly run company would have been made months ago. But nope, not Konami. That is far too logical for a company like Konami. They leave you in the dark, no communication with their player base, no care for what are our concerns.

I heard rumors about this event months ago. Months ago. It was even listed on the Toronto Convention Centre website. That is right. This event has been in the works for a handful of months. Let that sink in. Konami had the intentions of having this event back when hotels were cheaper, flights were a fraction of the price and when you could have appropriately requested work off. That is the way in which Konami has decided to treat our players. Are we seriously going to stand here and allow that to be the norm? Are you freaking kidding me? What does it take to list a YCS event the moment it has officially been negotiated with the venue? As a professional company with a player base that relies on organized play (and I use the word organized loosely), there must be consistent communication. In this case there was no communication whatsoever. An absolute atrocity across the board.

So what are we going to do about it? We could all individually believe that we should not attend. I know I feel that way. I am sick of this treatment, and as a player who has missed only two American YCS events since 2010, I am not attending. I could ask for work off, I could afford the trip - but I am staying home. I simply cannot concede to the this treatment. And we as a community should stand up and say no. That is the only way in which Konami will ever listen to our requests. Hit their wallet. Hit it hard. It costs Konami a lot of money to hold these events. Let them look over their field of players in shock. They deserve it. They deserve to tank tens of thousands of dollars. I know this article, Facebook group or YouTube video will not be able to hold the attendance to zero. But we can damn sure try. We can try to ‪#‎OccupyYGO‬, and if we fail - we can make noise. We can make a lot of noise. How many people have historically attended YCS Toronto? What if we can put up an attendance under 100? How about a venue filled with players but no one entering the event? or side events? A Yu-Gi-Oh blackout. Tell Konami how you feel about their event, and how they have decided to treat their player base.
Now I know, for a lot of people this is not something you want to consider. There are a lot of players who travel to each and every event. I am one of them. I am one of the people on the circuit. I schedule my year around each and every event. But the benefit of keeping yourself, and your friends at home is far beyond what showing up is worth. If we want there to be change in our game, we must be willing to make the sacrifice of this statement. Life goes on, there are more events. We can sit one out. Trust me, this is yet another event to give you the chance of finally winning a YCS or getting that first top. I know both of those feelings, one of which I live in to this day. But sometimes there are other things in life beyond that. What do we want as players? Better coverage. Live streams. Real rankings. Cash prizes. Better feature matches. Deck techs. New tournaments. Yu-Gi-Oh World Cup. Yu-Gi-Oh Players Championship. Real commentary. We want change. Let's make the sacrifice, and state what we want profoundly. It is just one event. Life continues after.

This is pretty important and worthy of discussion.  Many detractors have noticed Giorlando glosses over the difficulty of hosting large events, and that Takahashi himself says ""No Cash Prizes"".

The original topic is here: http://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/comments/1abdh1/coming_soon_yugioh_playbook_a_database_for_decks/

A few days ago I posted about the idea I had to make a site called YuGiOh! PlayBook! I expected some positive feedback, but I could never have imagined how quickly it would explode with suggestions and skyrocket to the top of the subreddit. With the amount of anticipation it bred, I decided I wasn't going to take this project slow. I spent the good majority of the last 24 hours (only 2 of which I slept during!) building 90% of the site from scratch. And it's here! Now that the long (but fun) and mindless debugging parts are over, it's time to call out to the community to start populating YuGiOh! Playbook! I even coded a sweet editor for those heavy contributors that might eventually get access directly to the site's database ;)

The site currently has one entry: http://ygoplaybook.com/deck.php?id=1
If you plan to contribute, use it as a template for your submissions. Remember, this site is NOT for complete decklists. It is for CORES + PLAYS! Leave the creative techs to the players learning from your entry, or let them choose their own.

Remember that the site's layout is not complete, but it IS functional.

**If** you run a META DECK, your help is most needed right now. If you can, write out the biggest and most crucial plays in your deck, how to pull them off, and a decklist. You can submit full decklists, but I will only be adding the core parts of them. Remember, PLAYS are the most important part of the site, so if you plan to contribute, be very descriptive and clear. At the moment there's no way to submit via the site (there will be tomorrow), but feel free to drop me a PM.

**If** you're interesting in developing for the site, drop me a PM. We've got a bunch of people interested, and I already reached out to a few developers. For those I haven't reached out to yet, you'll be contacted shortly as well.

**If** you can donate to the site, please do by clicking the Instant Fusion in the corner of the site. A lot of time and effort was spent getting the site up to where it is now, and I would like to keep it running with donations instead of intrusive ads. Keep in mind almost the entirety of it was built from scratch in the past 24 hours for the YuGiOh community. The more donations I receive the most time I can have to perfect the database. While I did create an editor, entries are still created from scratch.

**If** there's any hackers/skiddies/crackers out there, feel free to attempt to break into the site (provided you let me know how you did it). Always nice to see how well my security is doing.

**Lastly**, suggestions are greatly needed! There are still portions of the site that haven't been added, and will be later tonight or tomorrow. Some of those include searching with more criteria, the actual deck list section (which is almost done), tech cards, and much more. If you can think of any more information that would be beneficial if displayed on a deck page, do not hesitate to post it! Remember, the biggest contributors will eventually gain direct access to modifying the site.

Now, without further ado, it's time to duel!

**9:04PM EST** I've been hard at work on the actual site itself again, found some bugs/errors that I didn't see earlier. If you run into any errors remember to post here, as I don't thoroughly test every browser immediately. I'm going to be looking for contributors soon to add to the site because manually adding in each one while also working on the site itself is quite tedious.

It hadn't been announced yet, but check out this little doozie from dacardworld.com. It confirms this:

*Evilswarm/Verz is in this set! Evilswarm Ouroboros, aka infected Trishula, is the cover card so that may mean that Evilswarm Ophion and Bahamut (infected Gungir and Brionac) will be in this set since Trishula is typically the last one to be released.

*Knights of Star (The full name is Hidden Arsenal 7: Knights of Star) probably means that the Constellar series will be featured. (CONFIRMED! The given description includes Constellar).

*This set will be released on Apr. 19th, 2013.

People were actually pretty interested in my Skull Servant build that I have so I thought I would post it to spare people from long decklists in a comment section. 

**Mini-guide**

* Note: This goes for this variation of deck, not Piper, not smart mills, not merchant, etc. Also, I am bad at guides soooo yeahh....

Basically the main focus is to put Wights (King, Wightmare, and Lady in Wight) in the graveyard to boost the King of the Skull Servants attack power when he's on the field.

The deck's engine is mainly the Lightsworns. You want to try to put as many Wights in the graveyard as possible so milling as much as you can is a good thing. Ryko is great for a first turn wall or something that you can't get over. Lyla is good for S/T removal. Jain is mainly just a beater than can attack for 2100. Card Trooper is in there for milling too. Going back to 400 atk kinda sucks but the draw when it's destroyed is worth it.

Zombie Master helps for swarming and reviving other zombies while putting Wights in the graveyard. Snipe Hunter is also decent for putting things in the graveyard. It's like a risky Ryko but he can potentially clear a lot of the field. Goblin Zombie is a searcher (having your opponent mill their top card is nice too, if it happens). I recommend grabbing a King, Wightmare (if a King is banished) or mostly a Zombie Master. Mezuki is amazing for revival. Banish it to special summon a Zombie Master or King of the Skull Servants.

DaD, BLS and Chaos Sorcerer are just nice teched in stuff. DaD is amazing if you can summon him. Chaos Sorcerer is basically your crappier version of BLS.

You can actually run some common XYZ monsters. I definitely recommend packing a few Utopias (too OP) and generic Rank 4's. Slacker Magician is a great Rank 1. Leviathan Dragon, Zenmaines and Leviair the Sea Dragon could be a decent Rank 3 if you got Lady in Wight or Card Troopers out. I'd love to find an efficient way to banish Mezuki then get him back with Leviair and so on to make a mini loop.

The spells are mainly to draw (Allure of Darkness/Pot of Avarice), revive (Reborn/Book of Life), search (Charge of the LB) or removal (Dark Hole/Heavy Storm). I actually got ahold of some Forbidden Lances because they're cheap. I LOVE THEM.

The trap lineup is completely whatever you want to do. I just chose them because I like them. Threatening Roar is good for another round of milling or to just stop an attack (duh lol). Fiendish Chain to stop an effect and attack. Compulsory bounces. Fiend Comedian is a fun card just because it either helps you mill or banish your opponents graveyard.

**Here's my IRL build.** I change it so often online but they're pretty similar. Also, any changes you think are good, say it! I know we've got clever people and master deckbuilders on here.

I've seen this thread twice but I want to make myself stand out by giving /r/yugioh a big chunk of what I'm planning. 

I scoped out an area of town that is filled with schools and residential areas and doesn't have a card store or game shop. Before you ask, I've done some math already and the start up cost is around $80,000 . I happen to have a connection that, if I make a solid, well defined case that minimizes risk to the utmost extent, will give me a good chance at making this loan to me.

Here's the idea. A card store with enough space to hold 20-30 person locals and a small 5 computer area for hourly use for LAN events. I'm tinkering with the idea of doing a video game section as well but the profit margins on it seem minimal at best, and it would only serve to drive traffic to the store for the other things. I can offer the computer time for a discounted rate/ free for parents who bring their kids to events. Along with small printing ability if they need some documents done. 

I am going to speak with a former boss of mine who owns a small business (different category but he can help with the small business questions aspect of it). I also have a friend who can get me on speaking terms with my current locals card shop owner. He's a pretty cool guy but I have no idea if he'll even talk about the financial part of being an owner with a customer so I'll approach it from the friend of a friend perspective.

To compete with online I will offer trade in values for easy to liquidate cards and sell on an eBay/ TCGPlayer front as well. I happen to know someone who will be able to assist me with the manpower ordeal for minimal wage.

Anyway, the business aspect really isn't the thing I had a question for /r/yugioh about but I didn't want to get slammed with the whole ""cost, plan and, execution"" part. My question is ""How bad of an idea is it to open a card store?"" and ""What would you do to your local card store if you ran the place?""

Some of the ""special things"" I've decided to take from other stores/ experience:

* I understand that the retail aspect is simply to draw people in so they're comfortable spending money.

* Pack wars vs the store

* Small tournies if a group of friends stops by, they can pay $5 each and play toward that entire amount in store credit.

* I use to be the advertising guy for my high school newspaper so I know that can do wonders

* It's a higher end neighborhood so I know they're an active community and word can spread fast, as stated, I will stay competitive with online resources

* /u/HeyItsJay also informed me that I could run the shop as a church on Sundays before locals to get tax write offs.",,False,self,t5_2rpe6,1366878026.0,,earth,True,t3_1d29t6,http://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/comments/1d29t6/how_bad_of_an_idea_is_it_to_open_a_card_store/,

Gamble deck's are overall very fun and an oddly large amount of good effects, counteracted by the risk of them not going off.

It is by far my oldest and most likely well known deck,[\(As seen here\)](http://imgur.com/a/bDSNr) taken it to a Regionals and probably the best I've made. So most of the advice is based off my own deck, which I have found to be the most efficient Gamble Deck.

**Main Objective in a Duel:**To have a stupid amount of fun. Also to win by a single coin toss.

**Win Condition:**Half the time Burn seems to be the answer. Or getting amazing luck.

**Important Cards**

**MONSTERS**

Here are some really good ones that should be included in any Gamble Deck.

**Time Wizard:** The classic Gamble Monster, mass destruction for either side of the field. Should be ran at one usually.

**Sasuke Samurai #4:**He's simply amazing in the deck with his any attribute Catastor Like Effect(Which even works if attacked face-down)and personally I run at 3. Potential to take down multiple boss monsters.

**Twin-Barrel Dragon:**He's a one shot chance at a destruction but stupidly satisfying if you get two heads. Also a 1700 Dark Beater. Ran 2-3.

**Dice Jar:**A card to be feared and loved. Up to 6000 burn to either player you might just win a game early due to them using solemn warning. Best ran at 1.

**Jirai-Gumo:**Yes yes I know he has a horrible effect but a 2200 4 star who fits the theme? Sign me up. Usually best to just sit on it unless you're feeling lucky or have Second Coin Toss out. Ran at 1.

**Blowback Dragon:**1 Tribute, good Attack and a once a turn destruction with a high chance of success. Whats not to love? Ran at 1 for consistency.

**Maximum Six:**He's only a 1900 attack monster but his effect makes up for it to being a stupidly large beater, 2100 at the least.

**Gambler of Legend:**This guy is just silly sometimes and other times completely useless. Take him if you feel like it but don't expect consistency :D

**SPELLS**

**Second Coin Toss:**This is by far the most important card in the deck, it allows you to retry a coin toss effect(Not just one toss if you flip multiple times)however it does not work multiple times if you have 3 out. Best ran at 2 or 3, I ran 2 personally.

**Dicephoon:**It's the gamble MST except better. It can destroy 2 if you roll and 5 and because it is a dice roll your opponent cannot chain cards to their destruction as it is an uncertain effect. I'll go over that later.

**Cup of Ace:**Your best draw power, somehow you might always start out with 3. Amazing when it goes off right so best at 3.

**The Seal of Orichalcos:**You won't use your Extra Deck so this card is perfect, makes Twin-Barrel 2200 and Jirai Gumo a 2700 4 star. Overall just perfect.

**Dangerous Machin Type-6:**It's destruction, discard and draw power all in one! Unless you roll a 6 first turn and destroy itself. Very fun card.

**Graceful Dice:**Because why not?

**TRAPS**

**The Paths of Destiny:**2000 burn or gain, 600 burn if you ran Simochi but definitely a great gamble. Potential OTK with Dice Jar.

**Needle Wall:**A constant threat of monster removal for your opponent is just lovely, especially as you can use up to 3 in the same standby phase.

**Fairy Box:**A great stall/counter card. As it reduces their attack to 0 you might beat down monsters with Time Wizard. Also has a small upkeep cost.

**Skull Dice:**Same reasoning as Graceful.

**EXTRA DECK**

**Number 7:Lucky Straight** To Watch over your Duel in style. Best played face up in the extra deck zone. Only 1 or 3.

**Thousand Dragon:**If you're really feeling the Joey mood.

You can place some generic 4's if you care too but by no means should you have more or less than 7 total Extra Deck Cards.

**TECHS**

**Stall Cards in General:**Marshmellon, One Day and Threatening Roar are great here. Also a Magic Cylinder for no reason whatsover.

**Silver Sentinel:**This deck makes a healthy amount of S/T paranoia, leading to blind destruction which he punishes oh so well.

**Question:**If you feel like you can take their memory into a gamble.

**Yu-Jo-Friendship:**Nearly nobody would decline the handshake and it really creates a memory that somebody used it on you. Especially if at a regional or YCS.

**OTHER STUFF**

A few of you may be asking, why no Dice-Re Roll? IF it was a continuous trap it would be perfect, however as a one off trap it is far too situational.

Maybe you have some other gamble cards in mind that you would like to use, such as Gamble. This is just what I have found to be the most consistent, fun and effective build. Only relying on the cards that are still good.

Snipe Hunter is good yes however his cost puts a toll on this deck.

On the nature of uncertain effects as mentioned with Dicephoon. Due to you can not say for certain destruction will happen you cannot chain say Starlight road to Dicephoon if it destroys. The destruction is on the resolution of the card so cards will miss their timing to chain. You must chain TO a gamble card if it has no guaranteed effect.

There is one amazing power that the Gamble Deck Has. They can side in Macro and tons of side deck options like Soul Drain or Magic Drain with no fear of it hurting.

Other than that the best thing to do with this deck is to have a ton of fun and make memorable duels. Also the complete deck is less than 30 dollars to complete.",,False,self,t5_2rpe6,1362071775.0,,dark,True,t3_19d2j0,http://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/comments/19d2j0/gamblea_guide/,

In PM he told me his friend moved a month ago http://i.imgur.com/q36ylvF.png

However, his binder has 2 Star Eaters, which JUST were released. http://i.imgur.com/mt5EObSh.jpg

And a Noble Knight Drystan, which was also JUST released http://i.imgur.com/oWixGMsh.jpg

My conclusion is that he either robbed a vendor and made up this story to get the cards off his hands really quick, or he stole someones collection. What do vendors do? They stockpile on cards that will become relevant and thus expensive (horse rider, Mezuki, electric virus, droll and Lock bird). He has cards from every set, up to some more recent ones. Secret Rescue Rabbits, and I'm pretty sure I saw Noble Knight Drystans. From the set that literally JUST came out.

None of this is including the [max rarity spellbook deck,](http://i.imgur.com/nED2Fqzh.jpg) or the  [stockpiles](http://i.imgur.com/lrSxnrLh.jpg) of [popular](http://i.imgur.com/JGveTB8h.jpg) [cards.](http://i.imgur.com/R1pKhnPh.jpg)

1373255450.0,39,self.yugioh,1huch0,Thank you /r/YuGiOh!,55,16,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/comments/1huch0/thank_you_ryugioh/,"Thank you /r/YuGiOh .

My name is Jay and I was left under your wing about half a year ago.

My journey with Yu-Gi-Oh started on January 2013.  Format wonky and I started off with a mish-mash of HEROES at my first locals.

The very first time I went to a locals I had lost every single game but 1.  I was so happy to have won a game though I'm sure it was just out of sheer luck.

When I first started Yu-Gi-Oh I did so out of boredom, a night at Walmart and groceries ended up to my girlfriend and I buying 2 Structure Decks and 4 Booster Packs.  Just a casual hobby and got myself hooked and addicted to it.  YuGiOh was a much needed break from when I was working at the Health and Human Services Commission (Seriously, Food Stamp and self-entitlement was too high).

I then got hooked into it due to the competition of it and just the general atmosphere.  Reddit has helped me to be a better duelist than I would have alone, you gentlefolks have even shaped me to be someone that people ask!  I mean seriously, the amount of people that ask me in regards to help with their HEROES is insane and I more than appreciate it!  And to be honest I don't believe I don't deserve the notice for them :P

Half a year has passed since I learned the game, got competitive and managed to pick up and be really good at it.

You guys have shown me what it means to appreciate what I have (in terms of cards) to show my opponents the ropes if they are new.  To show decency and appreciation for the finer things that people put their hard work into.  I've picked up quite a few things to learn from you guys and all of it is appreciated.

I'm saying all this as I've sold my collection (YA YOU LOST OUT MICHAEL, KENNETH AND YOU OTHER NIGGAS) today and I've lost all the means to trade online.

I should be around 101 Positive Feedback and I feel that is a fine spot to stop at for the time being.  I will continue to play and all that though I won't be trading actively anymore.  I feel that it's necessary to slow myself down so I can keep enjoying the game as it was intended.  

I've met plenty of good friends here and I'm sure you guys know who you are you bad League players and worse duelists you.  I'll try and stick around in terms of helping people because let's be honest.  You can't really quit Reddit or the Internet.  So I'll continue to provide help to those in need!  Though now I find it appropriate to say Thank you for all the things that this community has done.  I know I might be just a no one here but I feel that I've helped a good amount of people!  I don't need any cards or any cash in regards to it but I'd like for you to pass it forward, knowledge, cards or any help you can provide those who are new as I know that all of us we're once new.  Hell to be honest, I did not expect to be where I am right now 6 months past, but I am.

I've sold you guys plenty and I've traded you all plenty, in terms of cards and I hope that you guys do somewhat miss me :P

Thank you for everything.

**I'm also wondering where my Sheet of High-Five paper is currently.  I started a thing quite some time ago that had a piece of paper with a high-five and a note to write your /r/yugioh name and date on it.  I'm wanting that back if it ever gets back to me :P and I hope it has traveled many places!**

Well my friends, I did it. Here's an example:

        Enter number of monsters to look up: 2
        Enter a monster's name: dark magician
        Dark Magician
        Level 7 Dark Monster
        Atk: 2500
        Def: 2100

        Level 8 Light Monster
        Atk: 3000
        Def: 2500
        This legendary dragon is a powerful engine of destruction. Virtually invincible, very few have faced this awesome creature and lived to tell the tale.

        {'Ancient Rules', 'Swing of Memories', 'Soul Resurrection', 'Cost Down', 'Soul Exchange', 'Star Blast', 'Daigusto Emeral', ""Summoner's Art"", 'Birthright', 'Silent Doom', 'Deep Diver', None}

It's pretty self explanatory. Throw in as many monsters as you'd like, it'll search for all the recommended cards to play with that one card, then it'll compare those recommended cards to the other recommended cards for the other monsters you inputted. Then after all of that nonsense, it'll spit out a list of cards that will benefit all the cards inputted.

So far it's still in BETA so there are some bugs, like that one 'None'. But overall it's pretty darn good. I'm already working on it to display cards pictures, be able to spit out a list of card ID's for those dueling simulators, be able to take in a list of ID's or Names, and I really want to make it a GUI.

Context:

Went into a random tag match, not realizing the host was playing with anime cards and traditional format.  I was using my Chaos Paladin deck and my partner was using Scraps, and the host's partner was using E-Dragons.  If you're unfamiliar with the anime version of Orichalcos: it's broken as fuck.  Can't be negated, chained to, or destroyed, and you can't activate any other field spells.  Opponent uses Big Eye to steal our Paladin and kill our Scrap Dragon, leaving us with 75 LP.  Partner's Meklord Emperor Granel gains ATK equal to half your LP, so he's sitting at the incredibly feeble, incredibly awkward 38 ATK.

Believe it or not, actually managed to swing a pretty big comeback.  I brought out another Scrap Dragon and popped Paladin, and then banished it for REDM, bringing back the first Scrap Dragon to pop Big Eye, leaving them with a basically empty field and both top-decking.  E-Dragon player gets out Redox and ends his turn.  Then my partner tried to use Scrap's effect to pop the field spell which doesn't work, realized he messed up, and quit.

This is because the shop owner doesn't want to compete with the players there to get business. Prohibiting trading on a trading card game sucks, but I go to this store anyways because it is close and my friends go there. It is a place to sit down and duel instead of playing on duelingnetwork whenever I want to get a match. I also met other people there who have helped me get back into the meta and overall it has been a pleasant experience thanks to the duelists. 

I started playing yugioh again after a four year break and I needed many new cards. I went to my locals to buy a lot of stuff like binders, protectors, and cards to get started again and I have given this shop owner so much business. I have bought over 30 booster boxes of cards and a couple of singles from him. Today, as I was leaving the store with my duelist friend, the shop owner told me that I would have to spend at least $20 on merchandise to be allowed back into the store and that my friend is banned from the store. This really rustled my jimmies. 

He doesn't even let you trade in the building. He expects a no trading policy and if we even walk out the store and across the street to trade, he will give us shit for it. I have never traded with any of the players there simply because I never found a reason to, and this is what makes me even more mad! These are absolutely ridiculous terms for a store, and I never broke the stupid rules he set up. Now, I'm going to have to hear shit from him for his stupid assumption. 

I thought he would have more common sense to value me as a customer, seeing that most of the people that frequent his store do not buy anything most of the time. Needless to say, if I go to his store, I will not be purchasing anything. 

TL;DR: My locals is a dick.

1340575013.0,39,self.yugioh,vjhei,trading etiquette and what to expect in r/yugioh. Please discuss so we can reach a general consensus.,42,3,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/comments/vjhei/trading_etiquette_and_what_to_expect_in_ryugioh/,"Our once tight-nit, small /r/yugioh community has recently exploded more and more into popularity, and I, for one, and happy to see new faces, discussions, content, and trade threads on here. That being said, our small group of traders has grown with new users, opening up to scammers and otherwise difficult traders. I thought it might be nice to add some guidelines that we can follow to help make trading here a tad more structured and easier enjoyed for everyone.

**posting your trade thread**

* please avoid all cap posts. New posts are less than a dozen a day. If I checked the subreddit today, I'm going to see your post.

* please do not bark orders. You are more than welcome to post ""I don't send first"" or ""won't send for less than 5 bucks in trades"", but please do it in a nice manner. Also, trading details should be worked out in a pm. Demanding that all your trade requirements be met without any will to budge makes trading with you undesirable.

* Please post an imgur link of your binder, list your cards, or perhaps a video in your trade thread. Posting what you are looking for and then going ""no binder but just ask and ill see if i have it."" Chances are i may be looking for really specific cards that you dont have, but i may be willing to trade for something i hadn't thought about or listed if i see it in your trades.

* do not ask for us to message you on youtube or pojo. Do not come to OUR trade community and then tell us to work out the detail on YOURS. It's rude. If you're going to use our resources to branch out to potential new traders, then you do those trades on that turf.

* after about a day of posting your binder, feel free to post in on [the big trade thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/comments/t7703/the_big_trade_thread/). Don't clog the subreddit with your same binder every day just because you bought some new packs. try to keep the posts to every 5-7 days if you get new stuff.

**finalizing a trade**

* have a camera readily available. Before a trade is finalized many traders will want to see photo ""proof"" that you own the card often with a piece of paper next to the card with your user name and time.

* Use the pm feature to send your trading address. try avoiding posting your personal information to the public.

* be willing to at least send at the same time, or first when you have little trade cred. trade cred is established with successful trades on this subreddit. Once a trade is completed, both parties post on the trading feedback thread.

* people are wary of new reddit accounts. I have a lot more to lose trading on my year old built up reddit account and then not being able to trade on this subreddit than a new user with no posts or karma has. Yes, i know karma really doesn't have value but for whatever reason we all value it.

**completing the trade**

* Cards when sent should be sleeved and preferably in a top loader. Do not cram too many cards in one toploader and risk bending. Also, have fun! Feel free to send thank you notes or extra cards. I cracked up hard recently when i opened my envelope to find my cards along with a bunch of doom doughnuts and butens.

* send your cards out in a timely manner. feel free to pm your trader if you got behind on sending them out, most of us are friendly and understanding.

* once you receive cards, please post feedback. it's the only way we can establish trade cred.

* please check reddit at least once a day, if you can. There may be problems during a trade, or someone could want to keep track of their cards to see if they have been recieved or not.

**Avoiding scams**

* ask for photo evidence/time stamp with a new user.

* ask a new user to possibly send first.

* be willing to lose what you're trading. If your card values are more than you're willing to risk trading with the person, simply don't trade.

* keep up to date with pojo and reddit for addresses to avoid. Not to be biased but san diego is often the source of a lot of scams. Make sure the trade is secured with trade cred established.

For those of you that aren't: it's a list put together by Judge Alex Gravely that makes it easier to figure out under which scenarios cards can and cannot be used under the effects of Prohibition and Psi-Blocker.

Let’s say that Machina Fortress is declared.

You CANNOT:

* Normal Summon (includes Gemini Summon).
* Set without a card effect.
* Special Summon without a card effect that starts a Chain.
* Use as Fusion Material.
* Use as Synchro Material.
* Use as Xyz Material.
* Declare an attack.
* Change its battle position manually.
* Activate or apply its effects. (If it’s a Spell/Trap Card, you cannot activate the card in the first place.)

You CAN:

* Special Summon it through a card effect like Monster Reborn.
* Add it to your hand through the effect of Machina Gearframe.
* Tribute it for the cost for the second effect of Enemy Controller.
* Change its battle position through the effect of A/D Changer.
* Use it for a Ritual Summon.
* Use it for the effect of Future Fusion.
* Use it as Tribute for the Tribute Summon of any applicable monster.

That covers just about everything. Just insert declared card A, run through list B, and extrapolate from allowed list C.

And of course, don’t forget that Prohibition doesn’t affect cards that were on the field prior to its resolution.

Population size = cards in deck

Number of successes in population = how many copies of what you want to draw remain in your deck

Sample size = how many cards you're drawing

Number of successes in sample = how many you want to draw

Lets say I want to draw 1 of 3 **MST** in my opening hand. 

Enter:

40

3

6

1

P(X=1) comes out to ~34.1%

Usually I check the bottom answer, P(X &gt;or= 1), as it tells you the probability of drawing *at least* 1. So 1, 2, or 3!

Say you want the chance of opening with a way to get to your **BroFist Bear** T1. You run 3 of it, and 3 **Tenki**. There are variables (like opening **Gorilla** and destroying a monster), but for the example, this means you have 6 successes in your population.

Enter:

40

6

6

1

The whole focus of this deck is to, hopefully first turn, send all cards to the grave in you and your opponents hand and on the  field. 

You start this process by dumping 
[Darklord Superbia](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Darklord_Superbia), [Darklord Zerato](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Darklord_Zerato) and [Sky Scourge Norleras](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Sky_Scourge_Norleras) into the grave using cards like [Hand Destruction](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Hand_Destruction), [Trade-In](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Trade-In),[Card Destruction](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Card_Destruction) and the effects of [Dark Grepher](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Dark_Grepher) and have 3 level 4 monsters out on the field including [Phantom of Chaos](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Phantom_of_Chaos). A simple way to get that field is to Specail Summon Grepher by pitching, then summoning Summoner Monk and activating his effect to Special Summon Phantom of Chaos from your deck, but at this point, like I said earlier, you will need your grave to be set up. There are many other ways to achieve this field(i.e. Instant Fusion, multiple Grephers and Reborn) but the grave is the hard part. The next step is to overlay 2 of the 3 monsters(not Phantom of Chaos) and special summon a Lavalval Chain. You will activate his effect to place a monster from your deck on top of your deck, that monster being Dark Creator. Now you will use the effect of Phantom of Chaos to banish Sky Scrourge Norleras from your graveyard and copy his effect to pay 1000 life points to send all cards in either players hand and on either players side field to the grave. This is not discarding so Darkworld monsters will not trigger. The effect of Norleras also makes it so the player who activated the effect gets to draw 1 card, and that card of course being Dark Creator. You should now have enough monsters in your graveyard to Special Summon Dark Creator. After summoning him, you will activate his effect to special summon Darklord Superbia and then Superbia will get you out either Darklord Zerato or Arcana Force XXI. If you want to really shut down your opponent then you are going to want to go for Arcana Force XXI(unless you have game a different way) but this requires even more graveyard setup.

**If you are summoning Arcana Force XXI** then you will need more darks in the graveyard but instead of using Dark Creator to Special Summon Darklord Superbia, you will Special Summon Phantom of Chaos and activate his effect to copy a Dark Creator in your graveyard and use the Phantom of Chaos to Special summon Superbia and then Arcana Force XXI then using Arcana's effect and praying to god you get heads. If the result is heads then you will tribute Superbia and Phantom to skip you opponents next turn. This route is risky but the risk can be worth the reward.

**If you are summong Darklord Zerato** then after summoning Zerato off of Superbia's effect you are either going to just straight up attack him or go the ballsy route and overlay all 3 for [Number 88: Gimmick Puppet of Leo](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Number_88:_Gimmick_Puppet_of_Leo) and  give you opponent 2 topdeck chances to make a comeback.

What decks does this deck struggle against?

In my experience this deck struggles against the following: 

* Evilswarm

A frst turn Ophion really hurts this deck.

*  Elemental Dragon's/Dragon Rulers

Dragon Ruler's/Elemental Dragon's could care less if you send there hand to the grave, because they will just keep coming back and plussing from the dragons getting banished.

How are all of you guys doing? So a while ago I posted my variant of Turbo Watts, and then I took my Watt Stun to locals and went undefeated. Since then I've been seeing people post a lot of mock Watt Stun styled decks, but making some fundamental errors. I'm making this, just like I made the [Chaos Agents guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/comments/19a8nc/chaos_agents_a_guide/). 

This guide is called Watt Control. It will be a basic outline for Watt Control variants (Stun and Stall) with each of the Stun and Stall cards in the tech section.



----

**1.0 The Core of the Deck**

* This is, without any question, what any competitive Watt Control deck needs

**1.1 The Monsters!**

*1.1.1 The Watts*

* [WattCobra](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Wattcobra): This guy searches every single other watt, including himself. **Run 3, period**

* [WattGiraffe](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Wattgiraffe): This guy is a Royal Decree, Effect Veiler and whatever the bullshit spell equivalent is, all rolled into one. Not to mention he is one of the strongest beaters you have. 1200, 7 attacks from this guy and you win. I will only XYZ after I attack with him, because they can't Veiler it or Bottomless it. **Run 3**

* [WattPheasant](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Wattpheasant): Broseph here is an amazing card. Fuck your XYZ, fuck your beater, fuck your shit. Simple and whistling. Combo's great with Mahunder too. Not as essential as the other two guys. **Run 1-3**

*1.1.1.1 Watts not to run*

* [Watthopper](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Watthopper): An effect so good, you can run a deck around him! Which is awesome. Unfortunately this is not the deck to do it in. Don't run him.

* [Wattdragonfly](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Wattdragonfly): Card is as slow as molasses straight out the freezer. He is a good card, don't get me wrong, but not for this deck. For a Wattlock deck, maybe.

*1.1.2 The Hunders*

* [Thunder Sea Horse](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Thunder_Sea_Horse): Holy shit sandwich with shit on top, Yugi. This card makes the deck. Opening with it first turn is amazing. Your deck starts flying. Seriously. It's floating away, better catch that shit. **Run 3**

* [Mahunder](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Mahunder): The strongest of the Hunders, with the same effect as Pa. For that reason only, this card is better. **Run 1-3**

*1.1.2.1 Hunders to not include*

* [Sishunder](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Sishunder): Good card in a Hunder famly deck. No, GREAT card in a Hunder family deck. Not good in this one. The other hunder allow us an extra summon, which lets us attack directly and then XYZ. That's making a play out of nothing. Sishunder doesn't do that. Her recycling effect is nice, but slow, and her not being to attack directly makes her 800 attack even weaker than it was before.

*1.1.3 The Rest*

* Honest: I'm not linking this card, this is fucking Honest, we all know how this big guy works. All the monsters are light. All the monsters are weak. Honest makes them strong, good job [Honest](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Honest). **Run 1**. If you're good at cheating **Run 4**

**This is it for mandatory monsters**

----

**1.2 The Spells**

*1.2.1 The Staples*

* [Mystical Space Typhoon](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Mystical_Space_Typhoon): I linked it for the people who accidentially random-subreddited here and decided to click on this link for shits and giggles. Howdy. **Run 2-3**

* [Monster Reborn](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Topdeck.net): **Run 1**

* [Dark Hole](http://kvartirakrasivo.ru/404/index.php): Please play this card correctly. **Run 1**

*1.2.2 The saving your ass Spell cards*

* [Pot of Duality](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Pot_of_Duality): Pot of Consistency over here is going to be helping us out. Thanks, would been better if they had just unbanned Pot of Greed, but whatever, it's semi-retarded buddy here is good enough. **Run 2**

* [Swords of Revealing Light](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Swords_of_Revealing_Light): There is actually a good ruling for this card. If your opponent has used all his MST's and Heavy Storm, you're allowed to flip them off when you activate this card. **Run 2-3**

*1.2.3 Don't run these Spell cards*

* [Heavy Storm](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Heavy_Storm): You run like 25 spells and traps. Seriously, don't do it. Don't. I just said not to, quit doing it.

---

**1.3 The Traps**

* [Threatening Roar](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Threatening_Roar): Seriously. It's G. **Run 3**

* [Waboku](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Waboku): Not as G. Still G though. **Run 2-3**

* [Macro Cosmos](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Macro_Cosmos): Welcome to the format. Play this card if you want to see how far the graveyard really goes. **Run 2-3**

* [Fiendish Chain](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Fiendish_Chain): It's like a Veiler who won't get ruined by Macro Cosmos. Fun. **Run 2-3**

* [Mirror Force](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Mirror_Force): After attacking into 3 Threatening Roars, 3 Wabokus and 3 Swords of Revealing Light, they've had enough of this shit. Attack and boom. **Run 2**

* [Starlight Road](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Starlight_Road): Because Heavy Storm is a bitch. **Run 1-2**

---

**1.4 The Extra Deck**

*1.4.1 The Synchros*

* [Stardust Dragon](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Stardust_Dragon): We aren't running Starlight Road cause we're allergic to The Huge Revolution is Over, that's for true. Use it's effect and get this guy.

*1.4.2 The XYZ*

* [Blackship of Corn](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Number_50:_Blackship_of_Corn): Helps you get that victory with one less WattCobra attack. **Run 1**

* [Gagaga Gunman](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Gagaga_Cowboy)(fuck the TCG name change): Burn baby burn. Make two in one turn, and look right into their eyes while you burn their life away. **Run 2**

* [Starliege Paladynamo](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Starliege_Paladynamo): All your cards are Light, use that to your advantage. Plus, you draw a card. **Run 2**

*The rest of this Extra deck can literally be whatever you want it to be, but basically any good generic rank 4 XYZ. Utopia and Utopia Ray are good to look into.*

---

**2.0 The Techs**

* Lets make your deck personal by following my exact choice of techs

*2.1 The Monster Techs*

* [Lava Golem](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Lava_Golem): Give them him and just sit back behind your countless stall. **Run 0-2**

* [Pahunder](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Pahunder): If you want to make this deck a little bit more XYZ-centric, go ahead. **Run 0, or 2**

---

*2.2 The Spells*

* [Messenger of Peace](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Messenger_of_Peace): Another really good way to tell your opponent that you really hate them. Do it with a smile though, that's true sportsman-like conduct. **Run 0-3**

* [Dimensional Fissure](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Dimensional_Fissure): If you're afraid Macro Cosmos won't be enough, you can breathe, this card still exists. **Run 0-2**

* [Photon Lead](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Photon_Lead): I hate this card. You might not. **Run 0-1**

* [Spirit Converter](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Spirit_Converter): It's a bit slow, but it's secondary effect is more versatile than Recycling Batteries, and it's primary isn't bad either. **Run 0-2**

* [Recycling Batteries](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Recycling_Batteries): Just draw it before Macro Cosmos and you're all set buddy. **Run 0-2**

* [Pot of Avarice](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Pot_of_Avarice): See recycling batteries for how to play it. **Run 3-7**

---

**2.3 Trap Techs**

*This is basically whether you decide Stall or Stun*

* [Solemn Warning](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Solemn_Warning): It's good this format, but Lifepoints are lifepoints. **Run 0-1**

* [Dimension Wall](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Dimension_Wall): You gotta like this card, and be smart with it. **Run 0-1**

* [Magic Cylinder](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Magic_Cylinder): It would be an amazing card, but unfortunately with Pandemic flying around, Dimension Wall seems like a better option for getting past it. **Run 0-1**

* [Compulsory Evacuation Device](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Compulsory_Evacuation_Device): It does what it does. It's good and sometimes great and sometimes exactly what you needed. **Run 0-2**

* [Dimensional Prison](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Dimensional_Prison): Doesn't destroy monsters which makes it pretty damn spiffy. **Run 0-2**

---

**3.0 How the deck plays**

*Slow*

Very slowly. You have to be smart with your resources, very few monsters and your stall cards will eventually run out on you. You have to really balance conservative playstyle, and then on those few moments when you can go for it, you really have to go for it. Hardcore. 

**3.1 The plays**

*Does this deck look like something that can combo? It can't, spoiler alert.*

* Thunder Sea Horse (pitch), add 2 more Thunder Sea Horse. Pitch those for Mahunder and Cobra, and then start summoning.

* WattCobra attacks. Only search out another Cobra if you don't have one in your hand. You don't want all 3 to be mind crushed. Search out Giraffe or Pheasant. If Thunder Sea Horse hasn't been played yet, search out whichever one you still have 2 of in the deck.


**Boom, y'all now certified experts at Watt Control. Class is now out for recess**

*But wait, there might be more?!?*

That is the deck that I am going to be taking to YCS New Jersey. I've taken it to my locals every week for the last month and a half and have topped every single week. My locals are very competitive too, with former YCS toppers and Regionals toppers. Plus they all seem to have unlimited funds, rich pricks.

1362002641.0,35,self.yugioh,19croz,Prophecy - A guide,39,4,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/comments/19croz/prophecy_a_guide/,"Since this seems to be the new thing to do I thought I'd take some time to write one myself.

So Prophecy. That one really expensive deck.

**Disclaimer** I'm only covering the light version of the deck. Someone else can write Reaper Turbo since I know nothing about the deck.

**The Concept** - The deck's concept and objective are simple enough. Use the various spells to generate great drawpower and quickly summon High Priestess for field control and game winning attacks.

**The Monsters**

* High Priestess of Prophecy - The main card of the deck. Easy to use, low cost destruction effect and 2500 attack makes her a force to be reckoned with. (run 3)
* Spellbook Magician of Prophecy - This little magician is one of the cruxes of the deck. Easily searched by Spellbook of Secrets, and gets you a free spellbook. Good for deck thinning + getting you into your field spell faster. (run 2-**3**)
* Temperance of Prophecy - So there are two monsters for getting you into a Priestess quickly. Temperance is my personal preferred of the two, but most competitive players will argue that Justice is better. Temperance brings Priestess straight to the field. (run 0-3 (depends on preference))
* Justice of Prophecy - Temperance's counterpart. Justice banishes itself to search Priestess and a Spellbook, but on the end phase. So while you +1, you also lose field presence. (run 1-3(again depends on preference))
* Stoic of Prophecy - Basically the deck's Sangan. He searches Justice or Temperance. (Run 0-1)
* Breaker the Magical Warrior - Everybody loves Breaker. One of this deck's weaknesses is its large amount of spells. Breaker is here to counteract that. He's a spellcaster, so he can benefit from Spellbook of Power or Wisdom, and fills the spots that MST would fill in the deck. (Run 2-3)
* Tragoedia - To quote Rimjobronny ""Run this at 2. No arguments, just main 2 of them. Prophecies are known for their tremendous hand advantage, and a 3600 Tragoedia is no joke. Someone runs over your poor little 500 attack SB Magician? BOOM, 3000 attack/defense trag to smack them in the face. It's level copying and monster stealing effects are also tremendous, allowing you XYZ plays (Gachi Gachi or Big Eye, anyone?) and OTKS. This is almost a no-brainer to run at 2, in my experience.""

**Optional Monsters**

* Apprentice Magician - Many people run this little card. It gives counters to breaker and can keep your field presence by SSing itself or Spellbook Magician. Useful, but not core. (run 0-3)
* Copycat - Possibly my favorite card to tech in this deck. It's always useful to be sitting on a Copycat in hand, and it provides another search target for Tower. Copycat + Spellbook of Power can be devastating to an unsuspecting opponent. (Run 0-1)

I know other players of the deck will mention other monsters I've forgotten in the comments, so take a look to see what others have to say, but these are the cards that see play in most Prophecy decks.

**Spells**

* Spellbook of Secrets - The universal searcher for the deck. It gets you any spellbook, and graveyard presence if you lack it. A prefered play of mine is to search Magician, or use Magician to search it, then search Tower and activate it turn 1. This gives you an extra draw turn 2, and you need the draw power. (Run 3)
* The Grand Spellbook Tower - The center of your draw power. Return a spellbook to the deck in the standby phase, and draw a second time. It also gives you a search on destruction. (Run 1-2)
* Spellbook of Wisdom - Forbidden Lance in Spellbook form. (Run 3)
* Spellbook of Power - +1000 atk for a turn, and a possible search. I play the hell out of this card, but not everyone loves it enough to give it much deck space. I run it at 3 myself. (1-3 (another preference card))
* Spellbook of Eternity - Your card for reloading banished spellbooks, and trust me, you'll banish a LOT of spellbooks. (Run 2-3)
* Spellbook of Life - A weaker Monster Reborn. Has some costs, so it can be a dead draw in bad matches. (Run **1**-2)
* Spellbook of Fate - An underestimated card. High cost, but you'll be surprised how helpful a quick-play-non-destruction-banish can be. (Run 1-2)
* Spellbook of the Master - A card that I don't own, but understand the power of. It builds graveyard presence. Plain and simple. I can't see you running more than 2, but I know people will run the playset. (Run 0-3)
* Staples - Monster Reborn, Heavy Storm, Dark Hole, but 1-0 MST. You have Breaker. Side MST in case of Macro Cosmos.

**Traps**

* This is a trap-light deck. Run royal decree, or maybe Threatening roar.


**Perks of the deck**

* No need for an extra deck.
* Strong match against Mermails.
* Will become rediculously strong with Lord of the Tacheryion Galaxy (or however you spell it)
* Lots of options. The deck seems to have one or two plays, until you actually play it yourself. The Spellbooks combinations possible are wonderful.

**Cons of the deck**

* Expensive as all hell
* Bad match with Six Sams
* Has trouble with Macro Cosmos

Overall, despite the cost, I find this deck very very fun. And despite common belief, budget builds are possible. Endymion the Master Magician and Prophecy Destroyer can fill the Priestess space. The deck will be nowhere near as good, but still decent.",,False,self,t5_2rpe6,1362005635.0,,wind,True,t3_19croz,http://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/comments/19croz/prophecy_a_guide/,

---

The two most wanted cards in the set are **Dracossack** and **Spellbook of Judgment**. To all the lucky bastards that pull them; don't let them go for less than $100. They are seriously wanted cards that form the backbone of the most powerful decks. I would let them go for $110 probably. 

If you have the slightest feeling of an unfair trade, back out. I don't want to see any threads asking about whether a past trade was a fair one. The night before you go, or even the morning of, *Google the prices*. You'll mostly find them on Ebay. They're Sneak prices, so no one's sure of anything yet. Some prices will go up, others down. But use judgment and try not to get swindled. 

As for participation, the most solid deck will probably be Battlin' Boxers because they're all Common with a Rare Xyz. Beaters like **Glassjaw** will shine, as we won't have all our fancy swarm tricks. If you pull a **Blaster** or two along with Boxers and Fists, you're in a *very* strong position, ready to beat down like mad!

Regarding support, the S/T that benefit you depend on the monsters you draw. But some will be all but universal. **Pinpoint Guard** and **Memory Loss** will both be very good in every deck.

There is a deck known as Worms that no one knows about with a great unknown power. So much of it got me my Nat. Invite this year. Worms are a stun deck that play 15+ traps and generate advantage with our Win Condition. W Nebula Meteorite is the best card in the deck and I will show you how to abuse it to victory. Now onto the deck.

**Pros:**

Everything is a flip summon so you can play really defensive which works amazing well with traps.

Since everything is a flip summon, you cant get veilered (except for Xex tears)

Has one of the best traps in the game as its support card

**Cons**

Since everything is a flip summon, you can't really ""go off"".
Deck is very slow. You can consider this a Pro (I do, since I like the play style) but most people are used to this current, extremely fast, format.

**The Deck**

**Monsters**

**Worm Xex:** (Reptile/Effect/1800/1000/4*)

When this card is Normal Summoned, you can send 1 Reptile-type ""Worm"" monster from your Deck to the Graveyard. If you control a face-up ""Worm Yagan"", this card cannot be destroyed by battle.

Xex is the bread and butter of the deck. Your main play is to summon Xex, dump Yagan from Grave, and some Yagan. You play **3** and there are no exceptions to that rule, unless you are bad.

**Worm Yagan:** (Reptile/Effect/1000/1800/4*)

If the only monster you control is ""Worm Xex"", you can Special Summon this card from your Graveyard in face-down Defense Position. If you do, remove it from play when it is removed from the field. When this card is flipped face-up, select 1 face-up monster your opponent controls, and return it to it's owner's hand.

Your main play is to get this guy dumped into the grave by Worm Xex. You play **3**, no exceptions.

**Worm Cartaros:** (Reptile/Effect/1200/500/4*)

FLIP: Add 1 Level 4 or lower Reptile-Type ""Worm"" monster from your Deck to your hand.

A Stratos, greatly helps with consistency. If you give me a reason on why you wouldn't play **3** then I will give you free internet cookies.

**Worm King:** (Reptile/Effect/2700/1100/8*)

This card can be Tribute Summoned in face-up Attack Position by Tributing 1 Reptile-Type ""Worm"" monster. You can Tribute 1 Reptile-Type ""Worm"" monster to select 1 card your opponent controls, and destroy it.

He is your boss monster, you get him out with W Nebula and he wrecks face. There are a numerous amount of plays you can make with him and **Call of the Haunted** which I will get to in the **Traps** section. I normally play **1** for consistency issues, but people sometimes play **2**. I strongly disagree with this. Drawing it is extremely dead and if you are in a situation where you would have 2, you should be able to win without the 2nd one.

**Honest:** (Fairy/Effect/1100/1900/4*)

During your Main Phase: You can return this card from the field to its owner's hand. During either player's Damage Step, when a face-up LIGHT monster you control battles: You can send this card from your hand to the Graveyard; that monster gain ATK equal to the ATK of the opponent's monster it is battling, until the End Phase.

Your entire deck is light, I have no idea why wouldn't place this killing machine. You play **1** with no exceptions.

**Thunder King Rai-Oh:** (Thunder/Effect/1900/800/4*)

Neither player can add cards from their Deck to their hand except by drawing them. During either player's turn, when your opponent would Special Summon a monster: You can send this face-up card to the Graveyard; negate the Special Summon, and if you do, destroy it.

As we all know, Rai-Oh is a force to reckoned with. An extremely powerful Turn 1 summon. The deck is stun so ideally cap it out at **2** since the little mean children at Konami felt like Semi-Limiting him (tears).

**Genex Ally Birdman** (Machine/Tuner/1400/400/3*)

You can return 1 face-up monster you control to the hand to Special Summon this card from your hand, and this card gains 500 ATK if it was a WIND monster you returned. If this card is Special Summoned with this effect, remove it from play when it is removed from the field.

People seem to like Birdman in this deck because with Tri-Force, you can spam Yagans and Kings like there is no tomorrow. Although, Birdman does have consistency issues, so I prefer not to run him. Run **0-1** but I would stick with 0.

**Evil Dragon Ananta** (Reptile/Effect/?/?/8*)

This card cannot be Normal Summoned or Set. This card cannot be Special Summoned except by removing from play all Reptile-Type monsters from your side of the field and Graveyard. This card's ATK and DEF are each equal to the number of Reptile-Type monsters you removed x 600. During each of your End Phases, destroy 1 card on the field.

I really interesting card that potentially give several pluses if you can protect it, which is fairly easy considering 15+ traps. It can also be a very large beater. If you want to play it, play **0-2**. I personally don't like it because you can't push for game with it. It requires you to clear your own field and then can leave you vulnerable at times. It also limits the amount of plays I can make with **Call of the Haunted**.

**The Spells**

Staple stuff really, you **DO NOT PLAY HEAVY STORM** because you should always have back-row on board. Make sure to include **BOOK OF MOON** so you can repeatedly flip your guys face-down and spam their effects. Also, play **2-3 FORBIDDEN LANCE** to help protect your Worm Kings and make sure Xex doesn't get bottomlessed so you can continue to Yagan. Also, **MAX OUT ON POT OF DUALITY** so you can help your consistency.

**The Traps**

I like to play 18 Traps, but that is just me. It is really preference, I will go over staple traps to play and then you can change it according to your liking, since traps are really all about preference.

**W Nebula Meteorite**

Change all face-down monsters on the field to face-up Defense Position. During the End Phase this turn, change all face-up LIGHT Reptile-Type monsters you control to face-down Defense Position, then draw 1 card for each. After that, you can Special Summon 1 Level 7 or higher LIGHT Reptile-Type monster from your Deck.

This is the card that makes the deck competitive. You plus like a freaking mad man and then get to top it all off with a Worm King on board. An End Phase Nebula is sure to kill your opponent. Summon Xex into Yagan with W Nebula is already a +3. You play **3** NO EXCEPTIONS.

**Call of the Haunted**

Target 1 monster in your Graveyard; Special Summon that target in face-up Attack Position. When this card leaves the field, destroy that target. When that target is destroyed, destroy this card.

I play **1** as my personal tech. The amount of plays you can do with this card is unreal. You can do a simple CoTH Xex summon Yagan from grave, too something as over the top as this. 

So you just W Nebula after a Xex Yagan, so your board is Xex, Yagan, and King. Since Yagan was flipped face-down again after being flipped up, it isnt banished when it leaves the field. So King tribute Yagan pop. King tribute himself pop. Now Xex can pull yagan out of grave. Call of the haunted king. Tribute Yagan again, pop. Congrats, you just went +2 and cleared your opponents field :)

The rest of the traps are up to you. Traps you want to take into consideration are **Dimensional Prison, Solemn Warning, Solemn Judgment, Compulsory Evacuation Device, Fiendish Chain, I recommend double Starlight Road, and Mirror Forces.**

**Offering To The Snake Deity**

Target 1 face-up Reptile-Type monster you control and 2 cards your opponent controls; destroy all three targets.

It is a very similar card to **Icarus Attack** but there is a very small change which is the main reasons I don't run the card.

**The Reason** Destroying your own monster is **NOT** a cost. What does this mean? It means you can't target Face-Down Worms to destroy as opposed to **Icarus Attack**, which **CAN** tribute Face-Down Winged Beasts.

The only reason I would play the card is so that in certain scenarios, like a Stratos or Stratos-like monster attacking my Yagan, I can pop the Stratos so that I don't bounce it, give him another search, and make me go super neg. But since I can't tribute Face-Down monsters, I wouldn't play it.

**Extra Deck**

All you need is staple rank 4s although I will go over some other ones that are a definite must have.

**King Feral Imp** (Reptile/Effect/2300/2000/Rank 4)

2 Level 4 monsters
Once per turn: You can detach 1 Xyz Material from this card; add 1 Reptile-Type monster from your Deck to your hand.

At first glance, this card seems amazing for Worms. It is, and you should definitely play it, but you need to be smart about making it at the right time. For example, just because you have a Xex on field and Xex in hand, doesn't mean you go ballz deep and make this guy. It is the better play to simply wait for them to get rid of that Xex, then summon yours and get another Yagan. Or even Summon Xex, dump cartaros (I will make a section about this) to set up a nice Nebby.

**GaGaGa Cowboy** (Warrior/Effect/1500/2400/Rank 4)

2 Level 4 monsters
Once per turn: You can detach 1 Xyz Material from this card; apply this effect, depending on this card's battle position.
● Attack Position: If this card attacks an opponent's monster this turn, it gains 1000 ATK and the opponent's monster loses 500 ATK, during the Damage Step only.

This card is the bomb diggity, mainly because you can OTK really fast. Only a 3 card combo that is pretty easy to obtain. I will run down the steps.

1. Summon **Worm Xex**, use it's effect to special summon a **Worm Yagan** from grave.

2. Wait until your opponents End Phase or until they attack with something scary and activate **W Nebula Meteorite**, allowing you to bounce a card, draw 2 cards, and then special summon a **Worm King**.

3. Now you summon another **Worm Xex**.

4. **OBLITERATE**. 2700 + 1800 + 1800 + 1000 = 7300.

5. **Overlay** for **Gagaga Cowboy** and detach to burn for game.

**Constellar Omega** (Beast-Warrior/Effect/2400/500/Rank 4)

2 Level 4 LIGHT monsters
Once per turn, during either player's turn: You can detach 1 Xyz Material from this card; this turn, all face-up ""Constellar"" monsters you currently control are unaffected by Spell and Trap Cards.

Pretty self explanatory, it is a quick effect so if your opponent has less than or equal too 2400 LP, just make him and attack for game. If they chain something to the attack just chain his effect, pretty simple :)

**Photoknight Paladius**

2 Level 4 LIGHT monsters
Once per turn: You can detach 2 Xyz Materials from this card to target 1 face-up monster your opponent controls; its ATK becomes 0, also its effects are negated. When this card you control is destroyed by your opponent's card (either by battle or by card effect) and sent to your Graveyard: Draw 1 card.

Another pretty self explanatory card, just make it when you need to get over a threat that you can't get over. Like a Hyperion or Megalo.

I hope you enjoyed my guide and try out Worms one day :)

EDIT: Just to let you guys know, I only went over the core of the deck for the sole reason that I don't have the time to go over all 26 members of the Worm Archetype. Every Worm that is not listed in this guide is EXTREMELY lackluster and should not be played.

**1600/3000**

And here's a card that screams synergy with them, also coming out in LTGY:

http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Treasured_Sword_of_the_Seven_Stars

All of these Dragons are Level 7. Treasured Sword banishes a level 7 monster you control or in your hand to draw 2 cards, but you can only activate 1 per turn.

All of these dragons have such wordsalad effects (4 in all for each!) but they're quite similar so I'll describe all of them here:

* All Dragons can be special summoned with their own effects from the hand or graveyard by banishing 2 Dragon monsters, 2 monsters of their respective attribute, or a combination of each, from the hand OR graveyard. However they can't banish themselves as part of the cost. 

* When summoned this way, they return to your hand during your opponent's End Phase.

* All Dragons can discard themselves and one other monster of their attribute (from the hand) to activate a certain effect:

1. **Blaster** destroys a card on the field.

2. **Tempest** adds a Dragon-type monster to your hand. (No level restriction!)

3. **Tidal** works as a Foolish Burial.

4. and **Redox** works as a Monster Reborn.

* When any of these Dragons are banished (from anywhere), you can add a Dragon type monster from your deck to your hand with the same attribute as the Dragon.

Despite having all these effects, you can only activate each Elemental Dragon effect per turn. For example, if I use Blaster to dump itself and a FIRE monster to the graveyard and pop a card, I can't summon it right back that same turn.

So here's my thoughts for each of the dragons:

First of all, **Gold Sarcophagus** immediately triggers their last effects for free, giving you a quick tutor for a WATER/EARTH/FIRE/~~AIR~~ WIND Dragon-type monster, and a Suppressor Dragon after 2 turns.

**Blaster** provides a potential way to dump of dead **Fire King High Avatar Garunix** in your hand or **Volcanic Shell** to mitigate the minus, but I can't see it being too useful in Fire Fist or Hazy Flames.

**Tempest** screams searching Dark Armed Dragon and since it is a level 7 Dragon, **Harpie Channeler** works very well with it. It may make **Dark Simorgh** WIND/DARK Harpie hybrids more viable. I am excited about this Dragon the most.

**Tidal**'s Foolish Burial effect DOES trigger Atlanteans in your hand (all 4 Elemental Suppressor Dragons' effects start a chain), but I would much rather use **Mermail Abyssteus**, as there's not a lot of particularly good cards in a standard Merlantean deck that you would want to dump to the graveyard as part of the effect. I guess if it's not rarity bumped it could serve as a nice beater with its solid 2600 ATK in Merlantean decks.

Don't know what to say about **Redox**. It could be splashed into Karakuris or Machina Geargia to make Rank 7s slightly easier.

You can click the two respective links to look at any sections that immediately interest you. There won't be any formal transitions at the end of these sections, although I will provide brief summaries at their beginnings. 

***
***

***Anime-Influenced Cards***:

No Yugioh set would be complete without the cards feature in the (in)famous anime, and there are plenty of them to be had here! For starters, many of Yuma's cards from the recent episodes of the series are spotlighted in this packing, adding support for the ""Syllable"" monsters he is famous for, alongside massive support for his *ZeXal Weapon* monsters. 

***
*""Syllable"" Cards:*

* **[Dododo Bot](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Dododo_Bot)**
* **[Gogogo Ghost](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Gogogo_Ghost)**
* **[Gagaga Clerk](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Gagaga_Clerk)**
* **[Zerozelock](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Zerozelock)**
* **[Gagagadraw](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Gagagadraw)**

The two most notable cards from here are the pair of *Gagaga* cards. **Clerk** can Special Summon herself from the hand if you control a *Gagaga* monster, and **Gagagadraw** gives the deck further draw power by banishing other *Gagaga* monsters from the grave. Whether these cards will boost pure *Gagaga* decks to be competitively viable is uncertain, but extra support has never hurt an archetype!

***
*Generic Yuma Cards:*

* **[Tasukerton](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Tasukerton)**
* **[Amarylease](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Amarylease)**
* **[Dimension Gate](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Dimension_Gate)**
* **[Xyz Double Back](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Xyz_Double_Back)**

Normally, the generic cards that Yuma has used in the anime have been rather situational, ultimately being a bit too specific to warrant regular use amongst other decks. A few of these cards, however, prove a bit more useful than ones seen in the past. **Tasukerton**, for example, is effectively another **Necro Gardna**, differing only, and most importantly, in the fact it can be activated during *either* Player's BATTLE Step. Though this effect can only be used once per duel, it wouldn't be surprising to see this card tech'd into decks such as *Lightsworns*.

**Amarylease** is also very interesting, as it can banish itself from the Graveyard as a substitute tribute for a Tribute Summon. An alright effect by itself, but with new monsters seen later in this pack, this effect may prove more useful than what meets the eye.

***
*Zexal Weapons:*

* **[ZW - Lightning Blade](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/ZW_-_Lightning_Blade)**
* **[ZW - Tornado Bringer](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/ZW_-_Tornado_Bringer)**
* **[ZW - Ultimate Shield](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/ZW_-_Ultimate_Shield)**
* **[ZW - Lion Arms](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/ZW_-_Lion_Arms)**

These cards make using the *Zexal Weapon* archetype a whole lot more desirable, and truly show off why **Utopia** is Yuma's boss monster. The Level 5 Weapons can freely equip themselves from the hand, allowing you to protect **Utopia** from destruction and targeting with ease. 

**Ultimate Shield** on the other hand present to the table a more unique effect, allowing a Special Summon of any of your banished Xyz monsters; **Utopia** needn't worry about **Dimensional Prison** or **Bottomless Trap Hole**, now!

Finally, we have the very first Xyz *Zexal Weapon*, turning a **Utopia** monster into *at least* 8000 cumulative Attack Points being turned towards your opponent's monsters and life points; the World Duel Carnival from the anime was right to give his deck the title ""Xyz One Turn Kill.""

***

Of course, Yuma is far from the only character in the anime. His friends and foes alike have their decks represented in this pack as well.

*Shark's Cards:*

* **[Spear Shark](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Spear_Shark)**
* **[Two-Head Shark](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Two-Head_Shark)**
* **[Xyz Remora](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Xyz_Remora)**
* **[Ancient Shark Hyper Megalodon](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Ancient_Shark_Hyper_Megalodon)**
* **[Xyz Dimension Splash](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Xyz_Dimension_Splash)**

Shark's cards feature basic WATER and Fish support that prove to be mildly interesting, and certainly could contribute to previous support from the recent *Abyss Rising* pack. The card that stands out the most, however, is **Xyz Remora**, as alongside the *Mermail* archetype, it has potential for devastating chains of Xyz Summons by continually recycle cards such as **Mermail - Abysspike**, or even one of the new *Mermail* monsters, as Xyz Materials for powerful monsters such as **Bahamut Shark** or **Shark Drake**. 

***

*Vetrix's Heraldry Cards:*

* **[Heraldic Beast Basilisk](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Heraldic_Beast_Basilisk)**
* **[Heraldic Beast Eale](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Heraldic_Beast_Eale)**
* **[Heraldic Beast Twin-Headed Eagle](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Heraldic_Beast_Twin-Head_Eagle)**
* **[Heraldic Beast Unicorn](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Heraldic_Beast_Unicorn)**
* **[Heraldic Beast Leo](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Heraldic_Beast_Leo)**
* **[Reborn Heraldry](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Reborn_Heraldry)**
* **[Heraldry Change](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Heraldry_Change)**

The *Heraldic Beasts* are now becoming very reminiscent of what the *Tech Genus* archetype did in the previous era of yugioh. Recycling Xyz Materials, Special Summoning each other and even (Psychic) Xyz Monsters, this overlooked archetype introduced in *Abyss Rising* is now going to be coming out in full force. Watch your Xyz Monsters, folks, as the **[Heraldic King](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Number_8:_Heraldic_King_Genom-Heritage)** and his **[Coat of Arms](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Number_69:_Heraldry_God_-_Coat_of_Arms)** now have their army.

*** 

*Dr. Faker's Cards:*

* **[Garbage Ogre](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Garbage_Ogre)**
* **[Garbage Lord](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Garbage_Lord)**
* **[Number 53: False-Body God Heart-eartH](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Number_53:_Fake-Body_God,_Heart-eartH)**
* **[Number 92: False-Body God Heart-eartH Dragon](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Number_92:_Fake-Body_God_Dragon,_Heart-eartH_Dragon)**

Here we get to not only the main antagonist of the first part of the anime, but also our first *Number* Monsters of this set, not forgetting, of course, that **Heart-eartH Dragon** is the cover card for the entire set. While the miniature *Garbage* archetype proves to be mildly interesting, the *Number*s are what take the spotlight here, given **53**'s field presence and **92**'s field control. Their powerful effects come with matching Summoning costs, however; only time will tell if the large summoning condition of 3 Level 5 monsters will be worth the use of the *Heart-eartH* cards.

***

*Kite Support:*

* **[Orbital 7](http://goo.gl/URPY1)**

This card was somewhat out of the blue, as **Orbital 7** is a *character* from the anime, not a card itself. It certainly proves to be a boon for the *Photon/Galaxy* joint-archetypes, however, as aids in summoning **Galaxy-Eyes**, alongside recycling monsters from the Graveyard.

If people of reddit would work with me and the people that have sent cards out please pm with the cards that were sent and your address I will do all I can to get the cards back out to you..

Card Advantage is the concept of how many cards you control currently (hand and field) vs how many your opponent controls.

The modern meta-game is now almost completely based off of card advantage. How many cards I used vs. how many cards you used. If you maintain advantage over your opponent, you will be successful. For example, if I sacrifice two monsters for blue eyes white dragon, I essentially minused two from my card advantage. Two of my monsters went to the grave, and one from my hand. If my opponent smashing grounds, I am now minus three, and my opponent is minus one. Soon, I will be topdecking, and he has advantage over me. However, if my Blue Eyes stays on the field and attacks over things, I minus my opponent many times, making my advantage. However, with so many easy ways to destroy monsters nowadays, most tribute monsters are not run.

While card advantage is not always a deciding factor in duels, it is indeed a good thing to keep track of. If your opponent is gaining too much advantage, you could be in a lot of trouble.

1376258302.0,33,self.yugioh,1k60yc,The real value of buying a JOTL box.,42,9,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/comments/1k60yc/the_real_value_of_buying_a_jotl_box/,"Hi guys. I see a lot of people asking if it would be worth it to buy a box of JOTL (or a box of any set really) and I cringe inside. If you know a little about economics (I completed an economics major btw), then you can calculate the expected return, or what you would make on average, for a box of JOTL. 


So what is the actual [expected return](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_return) from a box? Let's assume the pull ratios to be 5 supers per box, 2 ultras, 1 ultimate, and 1 secret. 


So lets start figuring out what the expected values are:


We have 8 secrets, all with an equal chance of being pulled. I'm going to use the lowest reasonable price for valuing the cards. I'm getting the numbers from [yugiohprices](www.yugiohprices.com) btw.


So here are the values of the secrets:

World of Prophecy: $11.49

Armades, Keeper of Boundaries: $10.98

Star Eater: $18.53

Transmodify: $17.44

Noble Knight Drystan: $11.95

Angel of Zera: $13.95

Coach Soldier Wolfbark: $29.23

Brotherhood of the Fire Fist - Rooster: $53.99



This means the expected value of the secret is: $20.95



Now for Ultimates:

Star Eater: $20.99

Number C39: Utopia Ray Victory: $5.99

Number C104: Umbral Horror Masquerade: $3.49

Bujintei Susanowo: $10.45

Rank-Up-Magic Numeron Force: $3.99


The expected value of the 1 ultimate is $8.98


The 2 ultras:

Bujin Yamato: $17.50

Mecha Phantom Beast Blue Impala: $3.48

Masked Chameleon: $7.44

Bujintei Susanowo: $7.49

Rank-Up-Magic Numeron Force: $2.49

Shapesister: $1.93

Mecha Phantom Beast Aerosguin: $1.93

Cockadoodledoo: $3.95

XYZ Encore: $6.43

Coach Captain Bearman: $1.45


So the expected value of an ultra is $5.40 or $10.80 for both!


For the supers:

galaxy serpent: $1.35

Bujingi Quilin: $4.75

Talaya, Princess of Cherry Blossoms: $1.48

Mecha Phantom Beast Concoruda: $1.85

HTS Psyhemuth: $1.45

Number C39: Utopia Ray Victory: $3.24

Starliege Lord Galaxion: $2.30

Number 66: Master Key Beetle: $9.95

Number C104: Umbral Horror Masquerade: $1.75

Herald of Pure Light: $1.89

Fire Formation - Yoko: $1.59

Traptrix Trap Hole Nightmare: $1.95

Fire King Avatar Yaksha: $6.96

Mist Bird Clausolas: $1.60


The expected value for a super is $3.01 or $15.05 for 5.


I've heard the chance of pulling a ghost rare is 1 out of every case or 1 out of every 12 boxes. This means the expected value of a ghost per box is the ghost's price / 12.


Star Eater Ghost is $28.97 so the expected value is 2.41.


I'm going to save some time for myself and say the average value of a rare is 50 cents. That means you net $15 from the box from rares. This is probably pretty generous since you usually can't actually sell all your rares.


Total Expected Return from Box: $20.95 + $10.80 + $15.05 + $15 + $2.41 = $64.21. This is assuming you can sell everything for the market rate right now. Honestly you probably can't sell most of the rares so you're probably looking at making closer to $50.

It's a little hard to make a deck based off of him when his deck is so old and none of his cards are exactly super good, but I wasn't aiming to win so much as make a kind of goofy deck that ended up being a lot of fun.

[Visual deck](http://i.imgur.com/5GeI2bR.jpg), here's the decklist:

**MONSTERS**

* 3x Mechanicalchaser
* 2x Barrel Dragon
* 3x Machina Fortress
* 3x Blowback Dragon
* 3x Machina Gearframe
* 3x Elemental Hero Prisma
* Rescue Rabbit
* 3x The Dark - Hex-Sealed Fusion

**SPELLS**

* Allure of Darkness
* 3x Overload Fusion
* Heavy Storm
* 3x Polymerization
* Power Bond
* 3x Upstart Goblin
* Monster Reborn
* Limiter Removal

**TRAPS**

* Dimensional Prison
* Time Machine
* 3x Call of the Haunted

**EXTRA DECK**

* 3x Gttling Dragon
* Mecha Phantom Beast Dracossack
* Number 11: Big Eye
* Number C39: Utopia Ray
* Number 39: Utopia
* Number 66: Master Key Beetle
* Gear Gigant X
* Photon Papilloperative
* Number 50: Blackship of Corn
* Maestroke the Symphony Djinn
* Lavalval Chain
* Daigusto Emeral
* Gagaga Cowboy

Like I said, I pretty much made this on a whim a month ago, so it's not exactly ""polished"".  Basically it's about trying to get out Gatling Dragon as soon and as often as possible using the aid of Prisma and The Dark - Hex-Sealed Fusion.  You can also bring back the fusion materials as often as you want using Call and Time Machine.

I just played a few games on Devpro with it again and I think I might try to play around with it to make it more consistent for a while.

Instead of using a lot of synchro summoning power, I went more for Xyz summons!

**A quick deck analysis**

The monster line-up is pretty standard, except that this deck does not use any Krebons like the old one did. Instead, it uses Risebell for level adjustment for synchro summoning and Xyz summoning. It's status as a wind monster means it can be used to make Lightning Chidori as well! Stratos helps with that too. There is a lot of search power in this deck too, so that's always a plus and it keeps plenty of cards in-hand.

Monsters: 19

2x Destiny Hero - Malicious

2x Destiny Hero - Diamond Dude

2x Summoner Monk

1x Dark Grepher

1x E-Hero Stratos

3x Risebell the Star Adjuster

1x Caius, the Shadow Monarch

2x Effect Veiler

1x Breaker, the Magical Warrior

1x Blackwing - Zephyros the Elite

1x Plaguespreader Zombie

1x Dark Armed Dragon

1x Tragoedia

Spells: 16

2x MST

Dark Hole

Monster Reborn

Heavy Storm

2x Emergency Teleport

2x Destiny Draw

1x One Day of Peace

1x RoTA

2x Forbidden Lance

1x Pot of Avarice

1x Allure of Darkness

1x Mind Control

Traps: 6

2x Bottomless Trap Hole

1x Sol. Warning

1x Torrential Tribute

2x Call of the Haunted

Extra Deck: Here's the important part! The deck can make a ridiculous number of different Xyz summons, so it's all about what fits best for you. The deck includes enough WIND monsters and enough warriors that it can include Blade Armor Ninja AND Lightning Chidori. Lavalval Chain and Emeral help you manipulate the graveyard like an absolute boss, Cowboy is excellent for burn damage and swinging over the big bosses. The deck also includes a few synchros, with Catastor, Crimson Blader, and Stardust being the MVPS for the tighty-whities. 

1x Catastor

1x Iron Chain Dragon

1x Crimson Blader

1x Stardust Dragon

1x Black Rose Dragon

1x Lavalval Chain

1x Emeral

1x Maestroke

1x Lighting Chidori

1x Gagaga Cowboy

1x Shock Master

1x Steelswarm Roach

1x Blade Armor Ninja

1x Photon Strike Bounzer

1x Constaller Ptolemy M7

To note: M7 is the serious hero of the extra deck. Why, you might ask? Because it can rescue your DAD from the grave and put it right into your hand. With this in mind, that DAD can even be used as fuel for Dark Grepher if you know you can get M7 out. If this is the case, then M7 literally acts as a graveyard search for DAD right away. It is just fantastic, and its 2700 attack puts Dracossack and the DRulers in a very precarious position. 

I currently give the deck a rating of 7.5/10: it's good, but it could use some work. 

I can always use some advice, so please, discuss away!

1362171691.0,34,self.yugioh,19hgc9,Get Your Game On! - A Comprehensive guide to being a true HERO,47,13,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/comments/19hgc9/get_your_game_on_a_comprehensive_guide_to_being_a/,"You probably wandered around in a vast sea of guides that don't really even constitute as a guide, more of a deck list as it doesn't explain why you run certain cards and what combos you can do.  You might be curious on how you can be righteous and brave fighting alongside with Justice &amp; *Honest*y in your heart.  Whatever your reason may be, welcome to the tall buildings, the gigantic gates, welcome to the land of **HEROES**.


**Why should I play HEROES?**

Great question, there's plenty of reasons why and I'll go ahead start

* You are *righteous*

* You enjoy the notion of going **ALL OUT**

* HEROES are capable of Controlling the field &amp; going for the OTK while being consistent

* Incredible amount of Fusions &amp; XYZ

* Close to unlimited Combo Potential

* Kickass looking Artstyle

* Unbelievable top deck capability (in the case you need it)

* Endless variants (it'll keep on growing)

* Incredibly fun &amp; easy to learn though hard to master


So now that you've had some insight regarding HEROES and still wanna go through with it, to learn the light, to be one with the winds and to be as splashable as bubbles I'll introduce you to some of the cards HEROES run and why you should run them.

**HEROES(Not Monsters)**

* **Elemental HERO Stratos**

1800/300

The Head Honcho alongside Bubbles, he leads most of the decks in terms of consistency.  This guy should be banned to be honest with you, he's a ROTA &amp; a MST depending on your needs and at 1800ATK, he's not too shabby.  Stratos is your key searcher and could be an effective backrow remover.  He can be cycled and you'd be able to use his effect to search out Bubbles and set your field with 2 XYZs &amp; a Fusion monster in the first turn (if you decide to unleash the nuts).  Regardless what HERO variant you run I highly suggest running a this bad boy.

* **Elemental HERO Neos Alius**

1900/1300

He's from space, he looks pretty cool and he's one of  your go to guys.  He's sitting at 1900ATK and is damn proud of it, able to run over some baddies and bump with the notorious King of Thunder. He's a Light monster &amp; Gemini to boot which means you can use Gemini Spark on him to pop one of your opponents Monsters/Backrow and be able to draw one, top that off you'd be able to use him for Hero Blast because he is a normal monster!(Hero Blast/Gemini Spark are cards that I'll touch up on later).  He can be used for plenty and might just save your ass in a pinch.

* **Elemental HERO Bubbleman**

800/1200

Bubbles right here might look like a weenie, but believe me; you won't be saying that after he shows you his true form which are Excalibur, Blade Armor Ninja, Elemental HERO Absolute Zero, Elemental HERO The Shining and much more.  This guy is what lets you unleash the nuts first turn.  Don't let the low attack fool you, his ability lets him be summoned from the hand long as he's the only one there &amp; there is a variant that makes the best use of this.  You'll be seeing him plenty and your gonna learn to love him.

* **Elemental HERO Voltic**

1000/1500

This guy is almost like a necromancer and allows for great plays.  Paired up with Fusion Gate, this guy brings out his full potential, deal damage to your opponent and special summon a Elemental HERO to your side of the field and the newly summoned HERO can actually continue an attack! Put a Voltic in the banished, Attack to get the Voltic, and get your last used Fusion monster and hit him!  Even able to XYZ into a Gagaga Cowboy to burn if that's all you need.  This card is phenomenal though he doesn't see as much light as Alius, he is a completely reliable HERO and he's actually my favorite aside Burstinitrix &amp; Lady Heat(lol)

* **Elemental HERO Ocean**

1500/1200

This HERO is fairly ok(in my opinion), and works super well again with a Fusion Gate (even better with the new Supressor Dragons!).  Pretty basic and straight forward.  Attack and bring back a HERO from your graveyard.  You'll be seeing her in one of my variants that make use of the Dragons from OCG

* **Elemental HERO Ice Edge**

800/900

This guy is not a bad dude, he has the ability to pop a set card your opponent has(Face Down Defense? NO SON) and he'll be acting as another MST.  Trick with him is he has the ability to attack directly by discarding 1 card and therefore you'd be able to pop a set card your opponent has.  He also looks pretty damn awesome.  There are a couple of decks that utilize Ice Edge to the fullest, I sadly don't have that deck. He also works incredibly well with Necroshade.

* **Elemental HERO Lady Heat**

1300/1000

I love her, and I mean that in like a Cyrus kind of way; she is adorable!  Lady Heat packs a nice effect along with her incredibly cute looks, she's a burn hero as her name implies and she's a Lv4 meaning easy XYZ Material and also a great material to make a Elemental HERO Nova Master.

* **Elemental HERO Heat**

1600/1200

Uggggh, He better not be anywhere near my Lady Heat.  This guy gains 200ATK for Each Hero you have in the field.  Meaning that he synergizes well with Lady(godamnit).  He makes for a good beater when you have another Hero out &amp; he is also another material for Nova Master(Why can't I hold all these +'s).  Heat &amp; Lady Heat are in my Flaming Heroes deck which is a little different from your standard HERO builds this format.  I'll be touching up on this later on.

(More HEROES to be added later)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'll stop right now with the monsters and list your important Spells, these are the cards that make the HERO archetype so damn unbelievable, and give you the ability to come back from something that looks grim. 

**Spells**

* **Polymerization**

Great gift from god or what, combines your HEROES to make a even better HERO? Yes please. You can use Polymerization from your hand so you wouldn't need to waste a Normal Summon, if they are on the field you can do that too.  This card is a great card, it excels in Flame Heroes as you have the ability to search for it using King of the Swamp.  

* **Miracle Fusion**

Polymerization for cards in the Grave or the Field only.  This Banishes your HEROES and giving you the option to bring out and power up one of the best HEROES, The Shining.  One of the most broken topdecks in the current state of YuGiOh, opponent killed off your monsters and their all in the grave?  Top Deck Miracle Fusion, pull into the Shining &amp; bam, you have a 3200 Beater that can bring back two heroes when sent to the grave. This car is the peanut butter to the Jelly of which is HEROES.

* **Super Polymerization**

Nothing says *""Fuck You""* more than using Super Poly on their Big Bad Boss Monster.  If you don't know already, Super Poly allows you to use their monsters as Fusion Material therefore getting rid of that baddy and giving you a Hero, all in the cost of discarding a card.  Seriously, this card is sooooo broke but I love it and so will you

* **Parallel World Fusion**

Having a hard time against Macro Rabbits? or anything Macro for that fact?  Fight them in their own game.  Parallel WF lets you bring out a monster from the Banished Zone into the deck and bring out a Fusion Monster.  What can they say to that?  Eat that Macro Cosmos.  Though this card isn't as strong of a top deck as Miracle, it still is a good top deck.  It acts almost like a Pot of Duality making it so you cannot Special Summon aside Parallel that turn, meaning you have to think, sometimes thinking is hard when all you do is beat them senseless though.

* **Fusion Gate**

The HERO deck that I started with, OMG I love this card.  It's a Miracle Fusion &amp; Polymerization in 1 and as a Continuous Spell due to it being a field.  You will have a field day with this up(given you run plenty of heroes).  Great card for HEROs, heavily suggest it as a gateway to the realm of HEROES.

* **E-Emergency Call**

This is another ROTA, except it is exclusive to HEROES and it's Semi-Limited, OK THATS NOT A PROBLEM AT ALL OFFICER. Search for a Strato or a Bubble to set up plays, you have such a big range of options with this card.  Definite must have for any HERO deck.

* **Gemini Spark**

This card goes hand to hand with Hero Blast to make Alius even the more terrifying, it's requirement is to tribute a Gemini to destroy a card your opponent controls and you get to draw a Card on top of that, can you say ballin'?

* **Pot of Duality**

Hero Decks need to run this for maximum consistency.  No reason not to run it, you can afford to not Special Summon for a turn to grab that Dark Hole or Heavy.  This is one of those cards that does take some knowledge to use.

* **A Hero Lives**

I enjoy running AHL as it makes it go so fast to set up.  At the cost of paying half your life-points, you can special summon a Elemental HERO from your deck.  Meaning you can Special Stratos and use his effect to get Bubbleman, then you XYZ into Blade Armor, then you Warrior Returning Alive, Normal Stratos then you get Bubbleman again and XYZ for Excalibur, then you go Call of the Haunted on Stratos and omg I can't even continue cause this is insane!  

* **A Warrior Returning Alive**

Bring Stratos back to your hand or bring bubbleman if you need the 2 cards, this card has its place in the HERO decks and though not commonly used, it has a good combo set with AHL.

* **Reinforcement of the Army**

This lets you grab a Lv4 or lower Warrior, your HEROES are warriors, why wouldn't you run this again?

* **Mask Change**

Heroes sometimes wanna hide their identity therefore they wear masks.  

You can chain this in battle phase and continue attacking for game or just clear the field or whatever you please!

(More to be added)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now it's time to look at the few traps that HEROES have, because lets face it.  They don't need traps, we come in, swoop by and kickass.  But sometimes even HEROES have a set-up or two of their own.

**Traps**

* **Hero Blast**

This only works on Normal Monsters like Avian, Burstinatrix, Sparkman, and *Neos Alius*!  Meaning you have a Trap Hole that brings back a monster from the grave to your hand while destroying an opposing monster with equal or less than the Attack of your targeted HERO.  Great combo with Gemini Spark.

* **Call of the Haunted**

This is a dangerous tool to use and destroy with.  You can use this to recycle Stratos and his effect to swarm your field as if your a Six Sam player.  This is how you set-up for the OTK and this is how you'll be able to rape face.  

* **Macro Cosmos**

We're not Macro Rabbits but we can definitely make use of this card to shut down an opponent.  With this up using Miracle Fusion doesn't affect you and next turn you'd be able to Parallel World Fusion to put them back in the deck.  It's a little unconventional but it definitely *can* work if you do your set-ups and your plays right.  Fighting a deck that doesn't run Macros definitely would have a tough time when they see that you can Fusion from the Banished.

* **Return from the Different Dimension**

Use it with Macro Cosmos, that's really about it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let's get down and dirty and talk about the Purple and Blacks.

* **Elemental HERO The Shining**

2600/2100

This guy is such a badass, gains power from banishing his comrades to safety and even bringing them back unscathe when he himself dies.  True HERO in my opinion, he gains 300 Attack for each Banished so he get stronger from there.  This guy has decks revolving around him, Shining Gate is an example.  It abuses him in fact.

* **Elemental HERO Absolute Zero**

2500/2000

This guy is a Raigeki.  Compulse will just kill your opponents field and he sits at a steady 2500 ATK and he'll stay there.  Absolute Must(lol) this card will win you games, hands down.  He even works with Mask Change Acid to be able to completely clear the enemies field.

* **Elemental HERO Nova Master**

2600/2100

Fire Omni HERO, 2600 ATK which is enough to run over a Laggia, Dolkia and your standard Lv 4 XYZs, on top of that everytime he kills a monster you get to draw a card, what could be better?

* **Elemental HERO Gaia**

2200/2600

This guy has an awesome name and a great effect to boot.  He's able to take half the attack of an opponents monster and add it to his own, great for running over high attack monsters.  Great utility and a a pretty decent defense. He has his time in the spotlight but when he does see it, he makes brings the oomph.

* **Elemental HERO Great Tornado**

2800/2200

This card is kind of like HERO GAIA, he's able to reduce all the attack of all opponents monsters by half giving you the power to run them over.  Good thing about this card is it lets you use Blade Armor Ninja &amp; Stratos as Fusion Materials. Once again a great utility HERO though you'll only see him once in awhie.

* **Elemental HERO Escuridao**

2500/2000

This HERO has his uses, one of them is for Super Polying your monsters Dark Boss and completely rendering him in shock and awe. He also looks awesome and he's in Star Pack.

* **Heroic Champion: Excalibur**

2000/2000

This guy uses 2 Lv4 Warriors to XYZ, with the ability to detach 2 and bump his attack to a total of 4000, this guy can clash and bump heads with Obelisk.  He would also constitute as half of your OTK! 

* **Blade Armor Ninja**

2200/1000

Excaliburs significant other, the O to his TK and the sword that finishes all.  BAN is a definite for most HERO decks due to the explosiveness he does, using 2 Lv4 Warriors to XYZ, by detaching one he can attack twice.  With a clear field he'd be able to drop your opponent to 3600 by himself.  Can you say awesome?  Yes. and you pronounce it as BAN.

* **Heroic Champion: Gandiva**

2100/1800

Gandiva is a pretty good card, with the ability to destroy a combo by Rabbit or Tour Guide definitely someone that you'd be able to use to even control the field. Usually never see's the field to be honest, but when she does she has a purpose.

* **Gagaga Cowboy**

1500/2400

This guy is a pretty kickass finisher.  Example, you take them down to 800 or less by attacking with Neos Alius &amp; Thunder King/Evocator Chevalier.  Main Phase 2 you XYZ in Defense Mode and burn them for game.  I can't tell you how many games I've won way too many games ending with this and it always makes me smile.  Definitely a must have.

* **Masked HERO Acid**

2600/2100

This guy in combination with Absolute Zero can clear the field and in battle phase after he attacks go ahead and activate another Mask Change to change into Vapor to continue the onslaught of Battle. Pretty good in my opinion.

* **Masked HERO Vapor**

2400/2000

Great helping hand with Acid to finish the game.  Can't be destroyed by card effects and easily brought out by Mask Change on any phase. Generally ran with Acid only.

**I definitely know that I'm missing plenty of HERO cards, I'm gonna try to mostly use cards that I use in real-life and stray away from the ones I don't know since I'll be giving out bad information if I did.  If you have a know how on how to use a HEROES a certain way, please let me know and I'd be able to include it here.**

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

**HEROES &amp; their variants.**

* **Bubble Beat** : (Link to Decklist here)

This variant is heavy on stunning your enemy and showing them the bubbles.  *Fairly* consistent and can get explosive.

* **Alive Hero** : (Link to Decklist here)

If you want to unleash the nuts play this.  You need 2 cards to go crazy, *A Hero Lives*, *The Warrior Returning Alive/Monster Reborn/Call of the Haunted*.  Super Explosive and Super OTK Power activate.

**EDIT: 03/02/13;1233AM.  Just got home from some drinks and food, I'm exhausted and will have to continue later on tomorrow.  Thank you for your guys patience and I appreciate your interest in me doing the guide.  Thanks alot!

**DISCLAIMER: I'm at work and typing this as it's not too busy.  I'll be finishing this up with full images and what not as soon as I get home.  I'll be showing most combos and the HEROES weakness, expect an actual guide!**

(Wanted to be the one to write for HEROES lol)",,False,self,t5_2rpe6,1362247446.0,,light,True,t3_19hgc9,http://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/comments/19hgc9/get_your_game_on_a_comprehensive_guide_to_being_a/,
1361982571.0,34,self.yugioh,19c12j,Gravekeeper's - A Guide,40,6,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/comments/19c12j/gravekeepers_a_guide/,"Strong against: Chaos Dragons, Wind-Ups, Agents, HEROs

Weak against: Dino Rabbit, Six Samurai

Gravekeeper's are an old archetype that cause nightmares for much of the meta. The combos are simple and effective, so a new player can play GK's and learn while being competitive. They're also very cheap to build, so they're a great pick for a new or returning player.

GK's use a three-point strategy:

1. Lock down the Graveyard with Necrovalley.
2. Stun everything your opponent does with a stupid number of traps.
3. Poke your opponent's small field with 2K beaters and Rank 4's until victory.

They run a low monster count and have tremendous draw/search power. The deck thins very quickly, leading to great top decks.

**Monsters**

* Gravekeeper's Recruiter. Searches every GK monster except Spy. Use it to keep Commandants/Necrovalley in hand and thin the deck. **Run 3.**
* Gravekeeper's Spy. A huge defensive wall that you plus off of, it sets up Descendant combos and Rank 4's. **Run 3**.
* Gravekeeper's Commandant. Searches Necrovalley. You will almost never summon him, but he's a good 2100 beater when he's out. I dump him immediately to thin the deck. **Run 2-3**.
* Gravekeeper's Descendant. Summon him with Spy, then summon and pop a Recruiter to clear your opponent's back row and get a search. When you're done clearing the field, attack then overlay into a Rank 4. **Run 2-3**.
* Gravekeeper's Assailant. A beater with a very useful effect to get over problem monsters. **Run 1**.

Do not run Visionary or Chief, they can be dead draws and are not very useful. Guard isn't necessary; he's slow and there's enough stun power and Rank 4's to get over problem monsters without him.

**Spells**

* Necrovalley. The key to the deck. **Run 3.**
* Royal Tribute. An absolutely broken card that will ruin your opponent's day. Never fear Gorz, Trag, or Veiler again. Set your back row and get a free look at your opponent's hand. If you drop this first turn, it's almost a guaranteed win. **Run 2.**
* Gravekeeper's Stele. Needed due to the low monster count. It combos great with Royal Tribute. Use it to bring back Commandant and get all your Necrovalley in hand. **Run 2.**
* Pot of Duality. Adds a ton of consistency, practically guarantees having a Necrovalley at all times. Use it to grab a Commandant then dump him to thin the deck, or grab a Starlight Road to protect your field. **Run 2.**
* Dark Hole. Duh. **Run 1.**
* Book of Moon. Get over problem monsters, protect your own from attacks, and recycle Spy. **Run 1.**
* Wonder Wand. This is assuming no Cardcar D. Equip Recruiter to draw 2 and search. A +1 that adds some speed. **Run 1-2.**
* Forbidden Lance. Protection for you monsters, or get over a beater. **Run 0-2.**

No Heavy Storm, you want to keep Necrovalley at all times. Even if your opponent has a big back row, your stun power will almost always be greater and you can clear it with Descendant. Be patient. Similar thinking on MST, you don't really need it (side 3, obviously). GK's win a battle of attrition.

**Traps**

Not going to go into detail here, run 10-15 staple traps, including 1-2 Starlight Road.

**Extra**

Staple Rank 4's; Chimeratech; Stardust Dragon; Catastor (use Veiler to synchro in a pinch).

**Side**

Mind Control (use if they run Level 4s), Max MST, Cyber Dragon, Maxx C, Gozen Match/Rivalry of Warlords, Nobleman of Crossout.

**Techs**

* Effect Veiler. Clashes with Royal Tribute, so be smart. Rounds out the stun capabilities. With 2 Veilers and a ton of traps, your opponent will not like you. **Run 0-2.**
* Malefic Cyber End. Huge beater. **Run 0-1.**
* Malefic Stardust. Protect dat Necrovalley. Doesn't hurt you since you attack slowly anyway. **Run 0-2.**
* Cardcar D. The Ronny build. **Run 0-2.**
* Blackwing Zephryos. Bounce Necrovalley for an easy Rank 4. **Run 0-1.**
* Genex Ally Birdman. Recycle your Spy. Opens up plays for Black Rose and Arcanite Magician. **Run 0-2.**",,False,self,t5_2rpe6,1362017859.0,,light,True,t3_19c12j,http://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/comments/19c12j/gravekeepers_a_guide/,

Ok, now that my yugigasm is finished, let's get in this thing. Umbral Horrors are one of the new sets from JOTL, and the one I've heard the least about. Everybody's gone gaga for Bujins, Rooster, and some other crap, but these little bastards got wrongly overlooked.

http://i.imgur.com/azsZpuv.png

Here's what I came up with.

**Monsters - (18)**

2x Druiz, the Devious Druid

1x Kagetokage

3x Masked Chameleon

1x Mystic Tomato

2x Summoner Monk

3x Umbral Horror Ghoul

3x Umbral Horror Unform

3x Umbral Horror Will o' the Wisp

**Spells - (14)**

1x Allure of Darkness

1x Dark Hole

1x Foolish Burial

1x Heavy Storm

1x Monster Reborn

2x Mystical Space Typhoon

2x Pot of Duality

2x Rank-Up-Magic Numeron Force

3x Recurring Nightmare

**Traps - (8)**

2x Bottomless Trap Hole

2x Compulsory Evacuation Device

2x Fiendish Chain

1x Solemn Warning

1x Spirit Barrier

**Extra Deck - (15)**

1x Crimson Blader

1x Scrap Dragon

1x Stardust Radiance Dragon

1x Abyss Dweller

2x King of the Feral Imps

2x Number 104: Masquerade

1x Number 16: Shock Master

1x Number 39: Utopia

1x Number 50: Blackship of Corn

2x Number 66: Master Key Beetle

2x Number C104: Masquerade Umbral Horror

Ok, so that first card, Druise, is in Shadow Specters, but he's perfect for this deck. More 0 ATK/DEF support is generally good for this deck. For now, I'd run 1 more Kagetokage &amp; Tomato. Anyways, the Umbral Horror's main man is Ghoul, the only one with attack points. By losing them, you get a free Xyz monster. A 1 turn Beetle, Utopia, King of Feral Imps for later Synchro plays, or any 2 monster Xyz you want. Unform's effect is situational, but awesome, and will see most of it's time as a Ghoul target. Wisp can clear problem cards and helps with Xyzs, as well as being another Ghoul target. With Spells, the set is mainly standards, with Numeron Force being for C104 (Very worth it), and Recurring Nightmare to replenish resources, as it can bring back all 3 Horrors. With Traps, I don't run Mirror Force or Torrential Tribute, because either A: Compulsory/BTH/Chain will deal with problems, or B:  Your opponent isn't getting over anything. Spirit Barrier curbs the hits you'll take from Wisp &amp; Unform.

With the Extra Deck, the Synchros are Crimson Blader, Scrap Dragon, and Stardust Radiance Dragon. The first 2 are self-explanatory, Radiance will protect things and still kick ass. With the Xyzs, it's the staples, Dweller, 16, 39, and 50, you all know them. King of the feral Imps is a big player, because it will set up almost all of your Synchro plays by grabbing Chameleon, Key Beetle is Key Beetle, and then we have the boss of the deck, Number 104: Masquerade. It mills your opponent, stops any effects in the Battle Phase, but we don't care. Slap Numeron Force on him to start wrecking shit. C104, Masquerade Umbral Horror, pops a backrow card when he comes out, and can negate effects at ANY point in the turn. Oh, and instead of just 800 points, let's just cut your opponents LP in half then swing for 3000. Yeah, I smell an OTK.

Personal comments: I really love how the OCG is gearing more towards Synchros than Xyz Monsters now. It's nice to see Stardust and friends run in a deck again, especially since the *Suppressor Dragons* can Synchro with **White Stone of Legend** to make a Lv8.

From the looks of the Extra Deck... it seems that DDR is quite a key card, seeing as he even ran a **Power Tool Dragon** to fetch it. (gotta burn dem calories, i guess)

Also, THREE **Drago-Sack** makes me think... was he perhaps... TRIBUTE SUMMONING Blue-Eyes? It's easy to dump two *Suppressor Dragons* onto the field, make **Drago-Sack**, and summon two tokens to use the last normal summon on our good old friend, **Blue-Eyes White Dragon**.

Edit: There has been a request for a Team Ritual. I say that if you can make it work, form your team! 
It's now a four-way contest for supremacy!


Edit2: I didn't expect this to get as much attention as it did, so now we'll go over the basics. :D
First off: Yes, whatever team you choose, you can use ONLY that type in your extra deck. (Including side deck, as well.) 
Next: This will most likely be held this Saturday on DN, at roughly 2pm CST. (I can work with you all if that's not a good time.)
Third: All games will be Advanced format. (Rated or Unrated matters not.)
Finally: Although using main deck ""bosses"" (I.e. BLS:EotB, Chaos Dragons, etc.) will not disqualify you, it is requested that your focus be solely on your Extra deck.


If you have any requests or suggestions, please comment or PM them!


Edit3: Alright guys, this looks like it's gonna be HUGE!!!! Please list the team you're signing up for as a comment on this post. I already have everyone that's currently declared their allegiance as ""signed up"", so you guys are good. Anyone else still needs to sign up. 

Best of luck to everyone competing!! 

(Also, it may not be wise to talk about your strategies on here, lest the opposing team catch wind of you.)

_ _ _

Rock Stun has been around for quite a while now; utilizing the powerful Koa'ki Meiru monsters, who do for Traps, Spells, and Effects what Thunder King does for Special Summons (including all sporting a daunting 1900 attack), but with brand new Earth Support from *Return of the Duelist*, this deck has some new toys to play with.

New cards from these previous sets have great synergy with the Rock monsters in this deck, and help transform it from being a simple Stun deck, to being a powerful anti-meta deck with powerful swarming and Xyz potential.

Today, I will be going over the main cards in this deck, the new cards that make it better, other various techs, and throughout going over the overall playstyle of the deck.

_ _ _

**The Koa'ki Meiru Monsters**

**[Koa'ki Meiru Guardian](http://images.wikia.com/yugioh/images/f/fb/Koa%27kiMeiruGuardianRGBT-EN-C-1E.png)**

&gt; Level 4

&gt; Rock/Earth/Effect

&gt; 1900/1200

&gt;     During each of your End Phases, destroy this card unless you send
&gt;     1 ""Iron Core of Koa'ki Meiru"" from your hand to the Graveyard or
&gt;     reveal 1 Rock-Type monster in your hand. You can Tribute this card
&gt;     to negate the activation of an Effect Monster's effect and destroy
&gt;     that monster.

* The first of our *Koa'ki Meiru* monsters. One thing to note, which applies to all the *Koa'ki Meiru*s, is that even under **Skill Drain** (whose usage I will cover later in this post), the reveal of a Rock-Type monster is a *maintenance cost*, NOT an effect. Therefore, these monsters shouldn't be on the field unless you either plan to Xyz summon with them, or you have another Rock in your hand, which shouldn't be an issue in most builds.

* **Guardian** is arguably better than **Doomcal** because it can selectively negate monster effects, as opposed to being triggered.

* All the *Koa'ki Meiru* monsters in this deck have the same Attack, meaning that there is a very high chance that if you draw into any of the monsters in this deck, you can likely beat down your opponent with ease, even without using their effects.

**[Koa'ki Meiru Sandman](http://images.wikia.com/yugioh/images/b/b5/Koa%27kiMeiruSandmanTSHD-EN-C-1E.png)**

&gt; Level 4

&gt; Rock/Earth/Effect

&gt; 1900/1200

&gt;     During each of your End Phases, destroy this card unless you send
&gt;     1 ""Iron Core of Koa'ki Meiru"" from your hand to the Graveyard or
&gt;     reveal 1 Rock-Type monster in your hand. You can Tribute this card
&gt;     to negate the activation of an opponent's Trap Card and destroy that
&gt;     card.

* Trap negate is always lovely; with his effect, he cannot be **D. Prisoned**, he protects your monsters from **Mirror Force** and **Torrential**, and can knock out the effectiveness of the majority of the opponent's backrow. Even if they try to activate **BTH**, this monster can tribute itself to be in the graveyard instead, where other cards and monsters can benefit from it.

* Along side another *Koa'ki Meiru*, depending on your backrow, this card can help create psuedo-lockdowns on the opponent.

**[Koa'ki Meiru Wall](http://images.wikia.com/yugioh/images/8/8d/Koa%27kiMeiruWallSTBL-EN-R-1E.png)**

&gt; Level 4

&gt; Rock/Earth/Effect

&gt; 1900/1200

&gt;     During each of your End Phases, destroy this card unless you send
&gt;     1 ""Iron Core of Koa'ki Meiru"" from your hand to the Graveyard or
&gt;     reveal 1 Rock-Type monster in your hand. You can Tribute this card
&gt;     to negate the activation of an opponent's Spell Card and destroy
&gt;     that card.

* Perhaps the best of the three *Koa'ki Meiru*s, simply because of the prevalence of Spells in today's format. Preserving your backrow from **MST/Heavy**, your monsters from **Dark Hole**, blocking an opponent's **Reborn**, or even activating this quick effect to block **Forbidden Lance**, are all incredibly useful. It is also invaluable against *HEROs* and *Dragons*, blocking *Miracle Fusion* and *Future Fusion*.

_ _ _

Overall, the effect negation from these three monsters, as well as being able to fuel each other's maintenance costs, means that they have incredibly synergy with each other. However, 9 negations only goes so far, especially factoring in how you draw into them. 

Before, there wasn't much that could solve this, and you had to hope in your Rock Stun decks that you drew into the proper monsters/backrow. Fret no longer, now, for there is a new champion of Rock monsters, one that turns this impregnable fortress into an offensive behemoth to be reckoned with. Right out of *Return of the Duelist*, the newest bulwark in the Rock arsenal!

_ _ _

**[Block Golem](http://images.wikia.com/yugioh/images/4/4c/BlockGolem-REDU-JP-C.jpg)**

&gt; Level 3

&gt; Rock/Earth/Effect

&gt; 1000/1500

&gt;     If the only monsters in your Graveyard are EARTH monsters: You
&gt;     can Tribute this face-up card to target 2 Level 4 or lower Rock-Type
&gt;     monster in your Graveyard, except ""Block Golem""; Special Summon
&gt;     those targets. This turn, those monsters cannot activate their
&gt;     effects on the field.

* Only Earth monsters? Hm... it seems that all those *Koa'ki Meiru* monsters are Earth... in fact, they are Rock too! Not to mention Level 4 or lower...

* This card allows recycling of your *Koa'ki Meiru*s from the grave, allowing for very versatile plays. You can choose different combinations of them to hand pick potential negation for your opponents next turn, along with attacking with a combined 3800 ATK. You can also choose to turn this card into effectively a 1-card Rank 4 Xyz monster. The importance and power of this card cannot be emphasized enough.

_ _ _

So now we have established that this deck not only has quite extensive and versatile effect negation but can now recycle those means of negation to either serve as a beatdown, fueling Xyz summons (potential monsters will be covered later), and fueling even *more* negation. Monsters aren't everything in a deck, however. Outside of basic staples, there are a few specific techs that help take this deck to further heights.


(Do note that for some of the following cards, I won't be doing the full layout, as even the most novice of duelists should be familiar with them)
_ _ _



**[Skill Drain](http://images.wikia.com/yugioh/images/c/c7/SkillDrain-TU08-EN-UR-UE.jpg)**

* All the Rock monsters so far have their effects resolving in the graveyard, meaning that this card can be safely run in the deck without affecting any major strategies. Though it may seem redundant to run this along side **Guardian**, **Guardian** has the privilege of extending its negation to... everywhere. 

* **Rabbit, Fader, Dark Worlds, Sangan, etc.** are all subject to **Guardian** where **Skill Drain** falls short, so, if anything, **SD** and **Guardian greatly complement each other.

* It also provides extra assurance in negation should you 'only' have access to **Sandman** or **Wall**.

**[Solidarity](http://images.wikia.com/yugioh/images/d/d7/SolidaritySDLS-EN-C-1E.jpg)**

* This deck so far has been able to (and will continue to as I will demonstrate below) to run only Rock monsters, so it seems to be a logical step to include **Solidarity**. Not much needs to be said, other than it turns you *Koa'ki Meiru* monsters into **2700 ATTACK** monstrosities.

**[Call of the Haunted](http://images.wikia.com/yugioh/images/9/96/CalloftheHaunted-GLD5-EN-GUR-LE.jpg)**

* A oldie, but a goodie. Still as strong as ever, especially in this deck, where you can chain this in your opponents turn to gain specific negation against them. (Be careful with the timing, though! You can't insert negations into chains)

* It can also revive **Block Golem**, effectively giving you a 2-for-1!

_ _ _

These cards together make a very solid skeleton for this deck, but there is more potential in rocks to be had! Next, I will be detailing some other Rock monsters that excel in this deck.

_ _ _

**[Gogogo Giant](http://images.wikia.com/yugioh/images/c/c1/GogogoGiant-YS12-EN-C-1E.png)**

&gt; Level 4

&gt; Rock/Earth/Effect

&gt; 2000/0

&gt;     When this card is Normal Summoned: You can target 1 ""Gogogo""
&gt;     monster in your Graveyard; Special Summon that target in face-up
&gt;     Defense Position, then change this card to Defense Position. If this
&gt;     card attacks, it is changed to Defense Position at the end of the
&gt;     Battle Phase.

* Rock? *Check.* Earth? *Check.* Benefits from Skill Drain? *Check.* Immense beater? *Double Check*

* This card brings not only extra offensive prowess to this deck (Solidarity boosts to 2800!!!), but it even allows for even MORE Xyz potential by being able to special summon another copy of itself from the graveyard.

**[Gem-Knight Pearl](http://images.wikia.com/yugioh/images/c/ca/GemKnightPearl-BP01-EN-R-1E.png)**

&gt; Rank 4

&gt; Rock/Earth/Xyz

&gt; 2600/1900

&gt;     2 Level 4 Monsters

* The *perfect* Xyz monster to run in this deck; Solidarity boost from Rock, and allows **Block Golem**'s effect to go off still. Not caring about Skill Drain, you opponent will be sure to tremble as you attack over their precious ""boss monsters"" with upwards of 3400 attack!

**[Fairy King Alverd](http://images.wikia.com/yugioh/images/7/7a/FairyKingAlverd-REDU-JP-R.jpg)**

&gt; Rank 4

&gt; Plant/Earth/Xyz

&gt; 2300/1400

&gt;     2 Level 4 EARTH Monsters
&gt;     Once per turn: You can detach 1 Xyz Material from this card; all
&gt;     face-up monsters currently on the field, except EARTH monsters,
&gt;     lose 500 ATK and DEF.

* Though not benefiting from Rock support, this new XYZ monster from REDU allows a single **Call of the Haunted + Block Golem** to turn into a very quick OTK with little investment. Primarily useful over **Pearl** in this regard because it can detach a material to refuel the grave for **Block Golem**.

But first, a little back story. I'm 15 and have never done anything to the point where I would get into and big trouble. I try to stay out of it and its been working so far, until yesterday. I was at my locals last Sunday participating in a tournament. I go there almost every weekend and is definitely a highlight of my week. That day my friend had asked me to pass me his backpack and I found a binder full of magic cards inside and I'm like ""dude, are you sure this is yours. There is a binder full of cards in here"". He assures me that its his and I pass it to him thinking nothing about it. 5 days pass and I'm back at my locals looking to finish me and my little brother's decks up. I'm putting some cards into my deck when the manager (who I am generally on good terms with) asks if I can talk to him in the back room for a minute. I say sure because its the type of thing where I basically say ""why not"". He said, and I quote ""you know how it felt when someone stole your binder"" (Someone had stolen my binder but returned it later with everything still intact) I said ""yeah, I do"". He replies with: ""Then why'd you take someone else shit"". I am extremely confused because I hadn't touch anyone binder besides my own for a couple weeks (I took a break from trading). I said that I had no idea what he was talking about. He said they had it on camera and I was going to be permabanned. I have no idea what to say until I remember the backpack and I say that its my friend's backpack. He respond with it isn't. Now this 30 something old man is interregating me by asking ""where's the backpack"". I keep on saying I don't know and that my friend has it. I make about a dozen phone calls trying to get my friend's number so I could get him over here. He eventually says I can leave and that my friend is coming with his mother. He also tells me that I'm lucky I not banned at all for what I did (even though I single handedly solved the problem). Fast forward to when I'm at home and I tell my dad the whole story. He flips his shit, we subway over to the store and he fights with the owner. The owner insists that I was on camera stealing something (I hadn't left the room with it). My dad calls the police and they said they were going to check with the owner of binder to see if anything was missing and that they were going to review the security footage to gauge ""my involvement in the case"". That is basically where I am now. I want to know what you guys think of the whole situation.",,False,self,t5_2rpe6,1373057158.0,,,True,t3_1hpk94,http://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/comments/1hpk94/so_i_almost_got_banned_from_my_locals_and/,

Dear Diary,


Today I went to locals. I went to sleep around 5AM Sunday morning after viewing some anime with /u/HeyItsJay, Joey, Michel, and Shelby. Woke up around 9AM expecting to be late, saw I was still early and went back to sleep. Woke up right on time at 11:30AM. Michel made spaghetti for lunch which I should have eaten right away but I made some last minute changes to my *Madolche* deck. We watched some Paranorman while I worked on  my deck. I ended up having to take it to-go in one of Jay's Sanrio Choco-Cat lunch containers. 

Jay made me drive. Someone scratched my new car. I was mad. It rained the night before so the streets were wet but since it's Texas, that just meant a humid afternoon. On the trip over, we talked strategy. I currently don't have a proper side deck and we have multiple Tier 0 decks on a weekly basis so it would come down to using the Madolche toolbox to outplay the other duelists.


Inside the store, I paid my $5 entry fee, signed my name, and said hello to the shop keep. ""Hello shop keep."" She's a nice lady and her daughter is really cute too. Pretty much all the guys pick on her for being really good looking, it's funny and sad to watch at the same time. Alas, sorry diary, she has a boyfriend.


**Pre-game**

Pregame consisted of perusing for trades and lending one of my friends, Christian, a Lavalval Chain for the tourney. He runs Battling Boxers now after abandoning the ways of the Madolche. I forgot all of my mats at home for some reason so I was forced to play on the tables. There's also no rules saying we couldn't drink a few beers before the tourney but that's a story for another time.


**Match One**

* Game one- I am matched with a little kid who is killing time during summer. His deck is... I have no idea. I plink his lifepoints fairly quickly. 

* Game two- I eat my spaghetti, swarm the field and win. It was delicious.


Christian walks over after my first match and asks what I have in the Choco-cat container. I tell him it's some spaghetti that my sister made. He says it made him hungry.


**Match Two**

* Game one- Six samurai. It's one of the judges, Patrick, and I lose the die roll. He basically opens the nuts with Naturia Beast, Shie-En, and Kizan turn one. I can't get around the combo and scoop.

* Game two- I side in Fossil Dyna. He specials his entire hand with no ptotection. Wahaha. I drop dark hole. He scoops.

* Game three- I summon Hootcake, activate Ticket, set Torrential and Compulse. He opens Heavy, double United for a +4 and I don't recover from a beatdown.


**Match Three**

* Game one- I play Christian and joke that I will be needing my Lavalval chain back. He opens Lead Yoke, and it goes back and forth. I lose to his infinite back row and no Heavy in my main deck.

* Game two- I Tiaramisu his double Lead Yoke and poke for game.

* Game three- We go into time and I force the Maxx ""C"" drop. I Hootcake into Messengallato, activate Chateau. I attack on turn 5, end turn, and win. He's kinda salty but he gives me some Cina-twists from Taco Bell later for lending him a Lavalval, which I bring back for my sister to eat since she likes Cina-twists.


**Match four**

* Game one- I play a friend, Nick, and win the low roll. I am the king of the low roll. He pretends to play Constellars but in reality it's Fire Fist with a few Constellars splashed in. He opens Omega, triggers effect for some reason so I chain Fiendish. He overlays with M7 and attacks into Messengellatto. I swarm the field over the next few turns and manage to take game one.

* Game two- He sides in Necrovalley and activates it turn one. I luckily have Chateau in hand but overall open poorly with only Hootcake. I force a Maxx C knowing he won't special at all. My draw is dead so I use Hootcake to summon Mewfeuille, XYZ into Acid Golem, and attack into his Pollux. He uses Honest. Turn three he activates another Necrovalley and I never recover.

* Game three- We go into time and I start at turn zero. I look at my hand and think to myself, 
&gt;""After this war, I think I'll go home and propose to my childhood sweetheart, get married, have some kids, and open a bakery... That would be nice.""

I summon Hootcake, activate Chateau, set Dark Bribe, set Ultimate Offering, and set Lance. In hand... Magileine. He sets a monster and one backrow. I draw into Chateau. The perfect hand. Magileine effect, Magileine to hand, and he drops Maxx C. I take the challenge. Ultimate Offering, Magileine, XYZ into the Queen. Activate Chateau, bounce his cards. I keep going. Eventually I end up with Leviair, two Magileine, Tiaramisu, and Messengelato. OTK.



**Top 8, Match five**

* Game one- I play Brian, who normally plays e-dragons, this week: God-frogs. The one week I took out my Masks of Restrict. I ran this every week for the past few months expecting to get smashed by this deck. The week I take it out is the week my worst fear is realized. He takes out my Torrential and Solemn. I don't recover. Monarchs smash though my hand and I don't get to go off.

* Game two- I side in three Gozen Match and curse out my lack of Restricts. The shop keep's daughter comes over to watch the cute cards that somehow made it to the final rounds. I special Junk Warrior and tribute him for Puddingcess. He opens the Toads and suddenly has three to tribute for... Slipher. Puddincess, on her tower of pudding, stood before a god in the eyes with a smirk; *Come at me, bro.* He passes. My next draws are dead. I start to cough up blood and drop my hand of cards on the table. ""I'm sorry childhood sweetheart... It looks like I won't be able to open that bakery with you like I promised.""

Now before you say it's dead if they don't have any Xyzs, how many viable decks run *no* xyzs at all? Mayyybe prophecy and lightswarn... It is a cheap replacement to the card [Xyz Reborn](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Xyz_Reborn) which has become very relevant this format. 

Lets talk about some pros about xyz revenge:

- Can basically shut off an Ophion if you already wasted pandemic.

**EDIT**: Does pandemic affect this card? It may not because it does not say ""Target an opponents Xyz monster that has material"" it just says ""detach 1 Xyz Material from a monster your opponent controls and attach it to that monster as an Xyz Material"" which leads me to believe it has the same ruling as [Space Cyclone](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Space_Cyclone), which is that it does not affect Ophion directly and therefore cannot be negated by Pandemic.

- Great card to side out/in. 

- Good at stopping annoying Xyzs, like, Big Eye, that you otherwise couldn't get over. You can steal their material and equip it to something like Tiras.

- It brings back your monster with no limitations other than your opponent needing a monster with materials.

- Opens extra deck space potentially by removing Temtempo. 

- Can reborn amazing monsters like Tiras, Atum, Big Eye, **Dracossack**, ect.

But it does have a few weaknesses, like:

- Can be negated by Lance/Pandemic.

- Your opponent needs an Xyz with material and you need an Xyz monster in the grave.

- It's a terrible first turn card, but then again so is Xyz reborn to some extent. 

All in all, I'd rather use this over Xyz reborn because 1) it's really cheap and 2) to me, it has a better effect because the deck I put it in, if I don't have any dead Xyzs, I'm either losing or winning by a lot. 

But what do you guys think about this card?

King Feral Imp is confirmed in the comments section to be a Common. (Cheap Kagetokage searches for everyone!)

And with this, I believe most of the rarities of the holos have been spoiled. [Following from Pojo's LTGY rarity list](http://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=1126660), the last Secrets are Totem Bird and Torrential Rebirth, along with Windrose, which we're all assuming to be Secret. Ultras have all been revealed. The 8 Supers listed on here are all new (except 7 Star Sword), which leaves only 3 slots left. All I'm waiting for is confirmation on Leadblow's rarity now...

I was going to write this report last night but opted to get drunk with my roommate and girlfriend. Now that I'm awake at 9 a.m. I figured I would do this report.

**Here is the deck**: http://imgur.com/a/3fXZX#0

-------------------------------------------------------------------

**Match 1** - Mono Mermails.

* Game 1: I got a Macro out pretty early. He made one big push but a Mirror Force stopped him cold. Win.

* Game 2: I open up with Thunder Sea Horse and a sided in Dimensional Fissure and Macro, plus some stun cards. I set Macro, pitch Thunder Sea Horse for two more. He reveals Megalo, pitches and after revealing no Heavy Infantry or Marksman, I flip Macro. He attacks and I waboku it. At the beginning of my turn, he flips a Royal Decree. I play my Dimensional Fissure and keep getting hand advantage with Thunder Sea Horse and Cobra. Win.

*Record: 1-0, 2-0*

**Match 2** - Fire Fists

* Game 1: I open up a ton of stun and WattCobra. He opens up with 2 Gene-Warped. After he attacks into a Mirror Force on his second turn and draws nothing on his third, he scoops with 1200 life points left. (This game was recorded by his teammate, but I don't know if they are going to upload it. If they do, I'll post a link to it!) Win.

* Game 2: He opens up great, and I only have my Swords as a stall card with no monsters. He eventually pops my Swords and starts swinging with a Tiger King and Thunder King. I end up playing Duality for a Dark Hole, and play it. I try and mount a comeback but end up falling short. Lose.

* Game 3: I open up well, with Compulsory and Dimensional Prison, plus Wattcobra. I set both, play Cobra and pass. He first turn's rabbit, which I slightly misplay and Compulsory it. I start poking for damage and then let him go. He does rabbit again, into double Warped. I'm scared he will immediately Tiger King it, but goes into the BP first and attacks, which gets D. Prison'd. End Phase the other Vanilla dies. I pretty much just start swarming with Mahunders and WattGiraffe and take game in the next two turns. Win.

*Record: 2-0, 4-1*

**Match 3** - Mono Mermails.

* Game 1: I open up Macro Cosmo, and thank the gods since I knew what he was playing (he sat next to me match 1). I set it and some stall cards, and pitch Thunder Sea Horse. He draws, and MST's my Threatening Roar! Chain that immediately. I then flip Macros Cosmos. It lasted about 4 turns and he scooped. Win.

* Game 2: I'm unsure of what he is siding. First turn he sets 2 and gets Megalo and Teus out. I open up a D. Fissure, and Macro, pitch Thunder Sea Horse and Duality into another Macro. I set both Macro's and a couple of stun cards. His draw phase, he flips Royal Decree, and I'm pretty happy. He overlays for Gaios, and trys to attack over my Cobra, but I waboku (as a clarification, I chained this to his Decree, thank you Bobnotk for catching this!) it. I draw an MST and pop his Royal Decree, flip Macro Cosmo, and his chains his other set card, Imperial Iron Wall. Damn. I don't have the resources to deal with his field, and he wins easily. Lose.

* Game 3: I side hardcore. I open up pretty well and we go toe for toe, with about 3-5 of his sided cards now being useless. Eventually he has a good field of Gaios and a set Linde. I draw Lava Golem and give it to him as a present while he has 1200 life points left. I then go into Cowboy and burn him to 400. He draws, sighs, and shakes my hand. Win.

*Record: 3-0, 6-2*

**Finals** - Hunder Family.
This guy is the resident pro at the locals, he travels to every YCS, has several tops and travels to any regionals from CT to FL. He also plays random decks every week, just because he can.

* Game 1: I open up Thunder Sea Horse with a Mahunder in hand and stall power. About as broke as can be. He goes off, Mahund into Pa into Vylon and goes into Shock Master, which gets Fiendish Chained immediately. I start going off with Thunder Sea Horses and WattCobra while getting swarm-help from Mahunder. He plays for a few more turns, but gets down to 3200 life points and scoops. Win.

* Game 2: I side out both Macro's and side in 2 Lava Golem. He also makes a small side. He goes first and gets out Thought Ruler. Oh... I use WattCobra to attack and stall. He finally gets an attack off, destroys my Cobra. :(. I draw useful cards for the next few turns and he draws backrow. So eventually he is at 3000, and I'm at 6300. He draws a Pahunder, and sets it. I had a Lava Golem in hand, so I give it to him at the beginning of my turn, and he torrentials but I have Starlight set. Easy game from there. He gives me a big handshake and tells me he is happy that two rogue decks made it to the finals and that I played very well. I'm pretty happy. Win.

*Record: 4-0, 8-2*

I won $24 in store credit for first, and wasn't too upset about it.

**Pros**

* Winning

* Starliegh Paladynamo being huge!

* Blackship of Corn

* Lava Golem

* Getting drunk afterwards.

**Cons**

* Player after round 3 was pretty bitchy about my deck. Kinda got annoying.

* Another, random, Mermail player told me my deck totally sucked ass, but he didn't even top.

* Store credit instead of packs. Sigh.

[**Number 107: Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon**](http://i.imgur.com/i2e26.jpg) 

*(Picture from ZeXal Episode 82; actual card artwork not released yet)*

&gt; Rank 8

&gt; LIGHT / Dragon / Xyz

&gt; 3000 ATK / 2500 DEF

&gt;     2 Level 8 Monsters
&gt;     Once per Battle Phase, at the start of your Battle Phase: You can
&gt;     detach 1 Xyz Material from this card; negate the effects of all
&gt;     other face-up monsters on the field, and their ATK and DEF become
&gt;     their original ATK and DEF. During your Battle Phase, if this
&gt;     effect was used and your opponent activates a card or effect:
&gt;     This card gains 1000 ATK until the End Phase and can attack twice
&gt;     during the same Battle Phase.
***

Here's a quick breakdown of the effect, as it is rather lengthy:

* Once per your BP, detach to negate all other face-up monster effects, and reset ATK and DEF modifications.

* If your opponent activates any cards or effects during your BP, **107** gains 1000 ATK and can attack twice.

Don't be surprised to see this as a new Rank 8 Xyz Staple, as it only requires *generic* materials. The ability to essentially reset monsters on the field back to square one with a non-targeting effect, without having to rely on the opposing monsters being Xyz Monsters, is also incredibly useful. This is particularly useful since it only affects monsters, meaning you are not forced to negate the effects of your own face-up Spells and Traps, like **Neo Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon** would do. As far as not negating your opponent's face-up Spells and Traps, **107**'s second effect helps rectify this as an issue for the most part, though it can't do anything against the continuous effects of Spells and Traps.

It is important to note, however, two things about the second effect of **107**. First, it is, by its current wording, a *mandatory* effect, at least in regards to the attack bonus. While this doesn't seem like a bad thing, it can, situationally so, be of detriment to you. This is because of the second thing that is noteworthy about the second effect; it *does not* negate the opponent's card effect. You gain 1000 ATK and an extra attack, but the opponent's effect will still go through. This means that this card is still vulnerable to such cards as **Mirror Force**, **Dimensional Prison**, and, the most trolly of this list, **Magical Cylinder**. Luckily, we have cards such as **Forbidden Dress** and **Forbidden Lance** to help mitigate such issues, but nonetheless, it goes to show this card is far from invulnerable.

The previous statement also holds particularly true given that the effects only occur in the Battle Phase. During the Main Phase, this card has no effects that can activate.

With all this being said, this card holds incredible promise, and it will be interesting to see how it gets used in a myriad of decks, thanks to its lax summoning conditions and powerful effects in battle.

What are your thoughts, /r/yugioh? 

* Will this card provide competition for the Rank 8 slot that **Heliopolis** usually dominates? 
* What sorts of decks will benefit most from this card? 
* What decks/strategies would this card be most effective against?
* What potential impact could this card have in our present meta? Or a *Cosmo Blazer* meta?
* For fans of the anime, how pumped are you to see **Galaxy-Eyes** vs. **Galaxy-Eyes** in episode 83 coming up soon? Will we perhaps see the cards used to summon it appear in *Road of the Tachyon Galaxy*?

We got there and signed in, lollygagged, looked at vendors(Picked up a German Catastor &lt;3)then sat and traded for a bit.

First round starts and I go to my table, opponent was almost late(They put his middle name as his last so it messed it up)but we go to dueling.

Go figure when I cut the deck and put his first hand on the bottom of his deck he draws his perfect hand. Turns out to be a variant of counter fairies, focusing more on counter traps(The one that lets you draw everytime one resolves, the big ol dragon that summons from it too etc)so that was a bit annoying.

Stupidly fun time, even if I lost two in a row doesn't really matter. He loved the deck and stated if I had used Yu Jo friendship he just would not have the heart to negate it. Cool guy so no sadness over a loss.

Derping around til next round, trading and such.

Suddenly Dark Worlds in next round. I open up with a pro cup of ace giving him 2 more cards and he does Dark World shennanigans so not much to say there XD

Second game of it he activated my Neko Mane King but the skill drain he had goofed me up D:

He too would accept Yu-Jo if I had used it, another person who loved my deck so I took the loss like a champ.

Derping some more and then third round.

Turns out I was against one of the friends I came with, Rock Stun. First game started out normal, I was able to poke with Sasuke Samurai for a bit, lost a paths of Destiny and it ended up he had a strong field and I narrowly avoided defeat with fairy box. 

Set a Dice Jar as a last resort, we rolled and it was enough to kill him.

Second game was a bit more of a stomp for me oddly enough, got out Blowback Dragon early so he couldn't really get over it. Ended up an easy win.

Real disappointing to fight a friend at regionals when we duel all the time XD

Fourth Game started a bit later and was hieretics! The dude loved my deck, no idea what I was doing when I summoned Jirai Gumo against a Strike Bounzer XD

He won first match with Dragon Shenanigans but then we went to game two and I got out Mask of Restrict first turn to shut down most of his plays. Although I failed a cup of ace so his tragodeia was 4k strong D:

Overall though he decided to gamble against Sasuke Samurai and I just continued to poke him down. I was worried however so I decided to go all out and use Dice Jar.

I rolled a 6 so he took 6k damage for the win, a Judge passing by was laughing at the result. 

Third game he got decree first turn so yeah not much to say there. Though when I showed him Yu-Jo he would not believe I was actually using it, another man to want to handshake it even at his own disadvantage.

After that me and my friends decided to drop(We were not doing well so no reason to stay for 6 more hours)but overall it was a magnificent time.

I highly suggest if you want to take a fun deck to do so, this one only cost about 30 bucks total and the reactions to some of the old cards are priceless.

Thus the Gamble Deck at a regionals was a success.

I love this game.

So the other day I posted this in a thread about missing the timing, and it got a lot of upvotes, meaning to me that people agreed/appreciated me clearing things up.

I would like to apologize and say that I put across some false information. So I'm just putting this out there to correct and finalize my little guide on types of effects and missing the timing.

My mistake was the part about **Sangan**

I'll make this as quick as possible, no walls of text.

4 types of effect wording, since we'll keep it simple for now and talk about effects that miss the timing. 

Phrasing is the thing to look for.

1) ""If X happens; do Y""

2) ""If X happens; you can do Y""

3) ""When X happens; do Y""

None of these can miss the timing. ~~The first two~~ These three effects start a new chain when the current chain resolves. 

*edit: 1 and 3 mean the same thing but may be written differently on different cards. They are both mandatory effects and will be the first links in the new chain, while 2 is optional and will activate after any other mandatory effects*

~~The third one happens IMMEDIATELY when X happens. **Sangan** is phrased this way, and if he is sent from the field to the graveyard during a chain, he grabs a monster IMMEDIATELY.~~

The last kind is the type of effect that misses the timing:

4) ""When X happens; you can do Y""

What this says is ""If and only if X is the very last thing to happen, you have the option of ~~doing~~ *activating* Y"".

In 4, if the last thing to happen was NOT X, you are not allowed to ~~do~~ *activate* Y because it has missed the timing.

*edit: remember that only the activation of an optional effect can miss the timing.*

***
Greetings, r/yugioh! I am here today to give my 3rd archetype profile, with this session's focus being on none other than the new Madolche Archetype!

Hailing from *Return of the Duelist* and *Abyss Rising*, it is one of the single *cutest* archetypes released in terms of artwork, but don't let looks deceive you! With unprecedented capabilities in recycling and searching, this deck maintains a continual stream of diversity and consistency. With means to both swarm the field and manipulate it, this deck is going to be one to look out for in the next format.

Today, I'll be covering the Madolche monsters, spells, and traps. Then, I will be giving a brief look at techs that help this deck thrive, as well as the archetype's strengths and weaknesses. 

&gt; **THIS IS A MULTI-PART POST. THE OTHER PARTS WILL BE IN THE COMMENTS BELOW DUE TO CHARACTER LIMITS, AS WITH MY PREVIOUS PROFILES.**
***
***
*The Madolche Monsters*

* The monsters of the archetype can be split up into 3 distinct groups, as it will soon become evident: the Pets, the Servants, and the Royalty. Each group has its similarities with each other that affect overall strategy and synergy with each other.

* 'The Pets,' as I like to put them, help establish field presence for the most part, in getting monsters to the field, helping change xyz capabilities, or manipulating your opponent's field. They are all Level 3.

* 'The Servants' are the main cards of the archetype that help search the deck for other Madolche cards, especially each other. Summoning these continually is key to the deck's success. They are all Level 4.

* 'The Royalty' serves as the source of our deck's two 'boss' monsters, which, while both sport amazing field manipulating effects, also act as key combo pieces for several of this deck's strategies.

* Practically all of these monsters sport the effect of being returned from the grave to the deck after being destroyed, which is absolutely **CRUCIAL** to many of this deck's strategies, allowing for a self-contained recycling and search engine within.
***
**The Pets**:

**[Madolche Mew-feuille](http://images.wikia.com/yugioh/images/5/56/MadolcheMillefeuille-REDU-JP-C.jpg)**

&gt; Level 3

&gt; Beast/Earth/Effect

&gt; 500/300

&gt;     When this card is destroyed by your opponent and sent to the
&gt;     Graveyard: Shuffle it into your Deck. When this card is Normal
&gt;     Summoned: You can Special Summon 1 ""Madolche"" monster from
&gt;     your hand.

* This monster is the main special summoner of the deck; able to summon any of the Madolches from your hand, it is crucial in setting up plays and activating other monsters' effects. 

* It can be used with the other 'pets' (who are all Level 3) to go into a quick Rank 3

* It is a key combo piece in one of the deck's potential OTKs

* Most builds can run up to 3 of this card, though Level 4 and specific OTK based builds should actually err against it.

**[Madolche Mehple](http://images.wikia.com/yugioh/images/1/17/MadolcheMouple-REDU-JP-C.jpg)**

&gt; Level 3

&gt; Beast/Earth/Effect

&gt; 0/1800

&gt;     When this card you control is destroyed by your opponent and sent
&gt;     to your Graveyard: Shuffle this card into the Deck. Once per turn:
&gt;     You can target 1 face-up Attack Position ""Madolche"" monster you
&gt;     control and 1 face-up Attack Position monster your opponent
&gt;     controls; change those targets to face-up Defense Position. Those
&gt;     targets cannot change their battle positions until the end of your
&gt;     opponent's next turn.

* This card is good defensively, serving to help the deck block powerful monsters from attacking, or to help the deck get over monsters that have high attack and low defense.

* Unfortunately, this card is one of the few in this archetype that fails to either search, or help set up plays. It *wouldn't be recommended to tech more than 1 in any build, if at all*, due to search-ability in order to selectively activate the effect.

**[Madolche Croiwassant](http://images.wikia.com/yugioh/images/b/bf/MadolcheCroiwanssant-ABYR-JP-C.jpg)**

&gt; Level 3

&gt; Beast/Earth/Effect

&gt; 1500/1200

&gt;     When this card is destroyed by your opponent's card (either by
&gt;     battle or by card effect) and sent to the Graveyard: Shuffle this
&gt;     card into the Deck. Once per turn: You can target 1 other face-up
&gt;     ""Madolche"" card you control; return that target to the hand, and if
&gt;     you do, increase this card's Level by 1 and ATK by 300.

* This card has the potential to become a very surprising beater in this deck, especially with the help of the deck's field spell (which will be covered in full shortly)

* Croiwassant can return any Madolche card you control, meaning it makes fantastic use of, for example, the Field Spell which has practically no consequence to return to the hand.

* Crucial in recycling monsters via the field spell (how will be covered shortly), aiding in going into several potential Xyz monsters, and serving as a very strong beater, this card should be run at 3 in the majority of builds.
_ _ _

**The Servants**:

**[Madolche Majoleine](http://images.wikia.com/yugioh/images/5/58/MadolcheMajoleine-REDU-JP-R.jpg)**

&gt; Level 4

&gt; Spellcaster/Earth/Effect

&gt; 1400/1200

&gt;     When this card is destroyed by your opponent and sent to the
&gt;     Graveyard: Shuffle it into your Deck. When this card is Normal or
&gt;     Flip Summoned: You can add 1 ""Madolche"" monster from your Deck
&gt;     to your hand.

* This deck's predominate searcher, allowing us access to *all* of the deck's monsters with a simple summon.

* This card's effect is a *VERY* surprising move by Konami. Unlike other searchers, e.g. Stratos or Agent of Earth, this card can search *itself* from the deck. This aspect of it allows for another one of the deck's OTKs.

* This card is a *must* at 3 in any sensible build.

**[Madolche Chouxvalier](http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120413222733/yugioh/images/4/4c/MadolcheChouxvalier-REDU-JP-C.jpg)**

&gt; Level 4

&gt; Warrior/Earth/Effect

&gt; 1700/1300

&gt;     When this card is destroyed by your opponent and sent to the
&gt;     Graveyard: Shuffle it into your Deck. Your opponent cannot target
&gt;     other face-up ""Madolche"" monsters you control for attacks.

* This card is the strong stat-wise of the servants, which further helps its decent protection effect

* Chouxvalier is one of the potential cards that can take place in one of the deck's OTKs, but it isn't necessary for it.

* Though good for protection and power, it doesn't (on its own at least) further any searching or active effects; it is a rather passive monster. 

* He is unnecessary for the deck, as there are better Level 4's to be summoning, and the trade off of an offensive+advantage based effect for a small amount of attack just isn't worth it.

**[Madolche Butlerusk](http://images.wikia.com/yugioh/images/f/f2/MadolcheButlerusk-REDU-JP-C.jpg)**

&gt; Level 4

&gt; Spellcaster/Earth/Effect

&gt; 1500/800

&gt;     When this card is destroyed by your opponent and sent to the
&gt;     Graveyard: Shuffle it into the Deck. When this card is Normal
&gt;     Summoned, if you control another face-up ""Madolche"" monster: You
&gt;     can add 1 Field Spell Card from your Deck to your hand.

* Butlerusk is a very reliable searcher for the field spell, assuming you've already maintained field presence for a turn (which is not too terribly hard of a feat)

* The utility of the Madolche field spell is significant enough to warrant this card's use, though he can noticeably search out *any* field spell. (Madolche + Seal of Orichalcos? lololol)

* Because of the importance to our field spell in the deck's offensive prowess and recycling, he should be run in the majority of builds: 2 in a deck is a good number based on experience.

**[Madolche Marmamaid](http://images.wikia.com/yugioh/images/2/2d/MadolcheMarmamaid-ABYR-JP-C.jpg)**

&gt; Level 4

&gt; Spellcaster/Earth/Effect

&gt; 800/2000

&gt;     When this card is destroyed by your opponent's card (either by
&gt;     battle or by card effect) and sent to your Graveyard: Shuffle this
&gt;     card into your Deck. When this card is flipped face-up: You can
&gt;     target 1 ""Madolche"" Spell/Trap Card in your Graveyard; add that
&gt;     target to your hand.

* The archetype bolsters many traps and key spells that help make this deck what it is.

* It is a lot harder to recycle the spells, so Marmamaid providin an excellent defensive pivot that is difficult to attack over allowing us to do just that makes her very useful to the deck when setting up.

* This being said, she can be a bit slow. 1-2 in most builds should suffice, due to searching capabilities.

**[Madolche Messengelato](http://images.wikia.com/yugioh/images/5/59/MadolcheMessengelato-ABYR-JP-R.jpg)**

&gt; Level 4

&gt; Warrior/Earth/Effect

&gt; 1600/1000

&gt;     When this card is destroyed by your opponent (either by battle or
&gt;     by card effect) and sent to the Graveyard: Shuffle this card into the
&gt;     Deck. When this card is Special Summoned, if you control a
&gt;     Beast-Type ""Madolche"" monster: You can add 1 ""Madolche""
&gt;     Spell/Trap Card from your Deck to your hand.

* The 2nd best searcher in the deck behind Majoleine. Used with Mew-feuille, he allows instant search of not only any of the traps, but also the deck's spells, including the field spell. This doesn't render Butlerusk as irrelevant, however, as they both gain their effects under different circumstances.

* 2-3 in builds with Mew-Feuille, but don't bother in builds without it; Butrusk can fill that role.

This is looking to be my longest profile yet, hopefully because I am going into greater and more quality detail as to the workings of the cards.

[Includes real Prizes] Details inside!,43,12,115,http://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/comments/tlv64/im_going_to_start_a_weekly_ryugioh_tournament/,"NOTE: SIGN-UPS FOR MAY 19th IS UP, GO HERE: http://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/comments/tnfb8/51912_ryugioh_tournament_signups/

**Weekly /r/yugioh Tournament**

Hello! My name is Aaron Carver, and I read and post on /r/yugioh pretty frequently. We have seen tournaments try to be set up here many times before. However, none of them have really be consistant, and usually are just a one-time thing. I look to change this by making a official /r/yugioh tournament. Here's how it's going to go:

**Where, when, and how**

**Where**

This tournament is going to take place on the website as everyone knows as DN, or [Duelingnetwork](http://duelingnetwork.com). This is because DN is just really easy to access and is free to use for everyone!

**When**

I will be hosting the tournaments every **SATURDAY @ 6PM PST** (Pacific Standard time). Please find out what time that is in your time zone if you decide on joining!

**How**

As I said before, it will be hosted on Duelingnetwork for ease of access and price. The other things I would like to do is have all participants be online on skype for ease of communication, as not all of us are checking reddit messages every 3 minutes. If plan on joining, I will have a **sign up post every sunday** , and all you have to do is **post your DN username and your skype username.** I will be having the brackets on the site challonge. I created a subdomain for the tournaments on challonge. You can find it [here](http://ryugioh.challonge.com/).

**Prizes and Rules**

**Rules**

* This will be a TCG tournament, so no OCG cards/decks please. (This is to ensure fairness in all competitors, as OCG cards may not be translated correctly and whatnot)
* BE ON TIME FOR THE TOURNAMENT. If you are not online on DN and/or Skype 15 minutes after the 1st round starts [6:00 PM PST] You will be disqualified. (This is to ensure speed of tournament and so others do not have to wait.
* No cheating whatsoever
* Have a good time, remember, its a card game where you have fun :)

**Prizes**

Heres how the prize system is going to work. I will be in charge of them myself. If you win a tournament, you will be rewarded Duel Coins based on the amount of people in the tournament (including myself). Note: I will be in the tournament as well, and I will start the same as everyone else. (This is so I can filter out people that can abuse the system &amp;amp;amp; I get to duel (:)

**Duel Coins System**

* &amp;amp;lt;5 Participants: For fun :)
* 5-11 Participants: 1 Duel Coin
* 12-16 Participants: 2 Duel Coins
* 17-21 Participants: 3 Duel Coins
* 22-26 Participants: 4 DCs
* 27-32 Participants: 5 DCs

Note: 32 participants is the max for one tournament as of right now. If you want to join, sign up asap on the sign-up thread every sunday. (this week it will be today)

Each Duel coin is worth 1 USD each. You may redeem them for **PAYPAL CASH** at anytime after you have won. Paypal will be used to ensure that everyone (internationally) can play and win money as well. It also is safer and faster than cash in the mail (and can be confirmed by other members) 

**Conclusion**

Well, I hope you guys like my idea and I really hope we can go through with this because I think it will really bring our community of over 2,000 together. If you have any questions about anything (related to the tournament), feel free to ask in the comments or in a pm. MAY 19th 2012 will be our official first tournament. I will post a sign-up thread tomorrow if I get enough support for this. Thanks for reading.

**tl;dr: Setting up a weekly tournament on DN. Win cash prize from tournament. Post below if you want to see this happen**

EDIT: Changed time from 7PM PST to 6PM PST
EDIT 2: Due to the large amount of people interested in this, I'm going to have to raise the participant minimum/duel coins won, otherwise I'm going to go broke xD
EDIT 3: Changed my position in the tournament, will no longer automatically be in finals. 

UPDATE: THERE IS A LIMIT OF 30 PARTICIPANTS, AND THE SIGN-UP THREAD WILL GO UP TODAY @6pm PST! BE SURE TO SIGN UP TO RESERVE YOUR SPOT!",,False,self,t5_2rpe6,1337048681.0,,earth,True,t3_tlv64,http://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/comments/tlv64/im_going_to_start_a_weekly_ryugioh_tournament/,
