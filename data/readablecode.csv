1366820689.0,64,self.readablecode,1d0n7o,Is it OK to split long functions and methods into smaller ones even though they won't be called by anything else?,74,10,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/readablecode/comments/1d0n7o/is_it_ok_to_split_long_functions_and_methods_into/,"Lately I've been trying to split long methods into several short ones. 

For example: I have a 'process_url()' function which splits URLs into components and then assigns them to some objects via their methods. Instead of implementing all this in one function, I only prepare the URL for splitting in 'process_url()', and then pass it over to 'process_components()' function, which then passes the components to 'assign_components()' function. 

At first, this seemed to improve readability, because instead of huge 'God' methods and functions I had smaller ones with more descriptive names. 

However, looking through some code I've written that way, I've found that I now have no idea whether these smaller functions are called by any other functions or methods. 

Continuing previous example: someone looking at the code might think that 'process_components()' functionality is abstracted into a function because it's called by various methods and functions, when in fact it's only called by 'process_url()'.

This seems somewhat wrong. The alternative is to still write long methods and functions, but indicate their sections with comments.

Is the function-splitting technique I described wrong? What is the preferred way of managing large functions and methods?

**UPD:** I've also posted this question to [programmers.stackexchange.com](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/195989/is-it-ok-to-split-long-functions-and-methods-into-smaller-ones-even-though-they/195992?noredirect=1#195992)",,False,,t5_2wk7l,1366821829.0,,,True,t3_1d0n7o,http://www.reddit.com/r/readablecode/comments/1d0n7o/is_it_ok_to_split_long_functions_and_methods_into/,

    void SpecialClass::update(const Data&amp; dependendData){
           if( GetType() == SPECIAL_TYPE){
                const String&amp; mainData = m_mainData.getData();
                const String&amp; mainBackup = m_mainData.getBackupData();

Notice redundancies. It is error prone and you have to make same change for backup as for the main. Using functions not only makes this more clearer but more maintainable. Here is a version that uses functions:

    void SpecialClass::update(const Data&amp; dependendData){
       if(GetType() == SPECIAL_TYPE){
           _updateSource(m_mainData,dependendData);
           _updateSource(m_backupData,dependendData);
       }
    }
    //updates main source and backup data
    void SpecialClass::_updateSource(SourceData&amp; src, const Data&amp; dependendData){
       const String&amp; srcData = src.getData();
       const String&amp; srcBackup = src.getBackupData();
       _tranformData(srcData , dependendData);
       _transformData(srcBackup ,dependendData);
    }

Some people may be worried that this makes it tough to tell how many arguments there are and what they represent, but most times it's easy to tell from the context, as evidenced by the fact that lambda arguments usually aren't very descriptive.

One downside to practicing this is you may become frustrated when you see lambdas that can't quite be replaced, which is rather often:

Here's hoping.]*

I find the code below highly readable. If you don't agree, **please post comments with specific criticisms**. Best of all, please contribute balance bracket parsers (for [ and ]) in other languages.

I particularly like the token (regex) definitions:

    grammar Brackets::Balanced {
        token TOP      { ^ &lt;balanced&gt;? $ };
        token balanced { '[' &lt;balanced&gt;? ']' &lt;balanced&gt;? };
    };

This defines two regexes:

* **TOP** matches a given input string from start (\^) to finish ($) against another regex called ""balanced"".
* **token balanced** expresses a simple recursive balanced brackets parser (elegantly imo).

Imo this is highly readable, elegant, no-comment-necessary code for anyone who has spent even a few minutes learning this part of Perl 6. As is some scaffolding for testing the parser:

    grammar Brackets::Balanced {
        method ACCEPTS($string) { ?self.parse($string) }
    }

* This code defines an ACCEPTS method in the Brackets::Balanced grammar (just like one can define a method in a class).
* The ACCEPTS method parses/matches any strings passed to it (via the parse method, which is inherited  by all grammars, which in turn calls the grammar's TOP regex).
* The ? prefix means the method returns True or False.

These two lines of testing code might be the most inscrutable so far:

    say ""[][]"" ~~ Brackets::Balanced;
    say ""][""   ~~ Brackets::Balanced;

* These lines are instantly readable if you code in Perl 6 but I get that a newcomer might think ""wtf"" about the ~~ feature (which is called ""smart match"").
* The ~~ passes the thing on its left to the ACCEPTS method of the thing on its right. Thus the first say line says True, the second False.",,False,,t5_2wk7l,1370290011.0,,,True,t3_1fle60,http://www.reddit.com/r/readablecode/comments/1fle60/is_this_regex_code_readable/,

As much as I respect their opinion and analysis I always wonder, does this make sense in real world boots-in-internet-mud companies with people with very mixed tasks and skill levels working together?

Like if you never use semicolons as promoted in the second link but need to take care of some edge cases, is the few bytes saved and proud elitism worth the practical costs of bugs, hassle or the presure of reeducating whole teams? 

Isn't code more robust if you add semicolons, full curly braces and all that explicit stuff? I'm sure we all have messed up editing an if/else statement that didn't have braces and bumbed the conditional outside the statement or other stupid but human error. Tests should catch that but we all know weird shit happens all the time, especially in development.

And what do you do with colleagues with just average skill? I know for a fact that a lot of them will not understand the issues. Does that invalidate them as developers? Some decent paychecks and big clients don't seem to care about it as long as Live code doesn't break so I find it hard to defend anything that degrades the robustness of code and minimizes real-life human error.

Hoe much should we aim for a theoretical ideal? Or do we focus on getting projects working fast and reliable?

I'll give a basic example in Java below:

    for(int count = 0; count &lt; 10; count++)
    {
        System.out.println(""Is that bracket placement right?"");
    }


I know that some people put it to the right of the statement as follows:

    for(int count = 0; count &lt; 10; count++) {
        System.out.println(""Is that bracket placement right?"");
    }

I know that's not wrong (obviously, so many people do it that way), but is it ""better"" than what I'm accustomed to or are both equally acceptable?

Thanks for your feedback!

EDIT: Thanks for bothering to answer my question!  I agree with everyone saying that it's a matter of preference.  I just recently got ridiculed for doing it the first way, and I was confused since both my high school and university did it that way.  In case anyone is wondering why I prefer the first way, I'll give an example:

    for(int count = 0; count &lt; 10; count++)
    {
        for(int count2 = 0; count2 &lt; 5; count++)
        {

            {
                System.out.println(count);
            }
        }
    }

In this example of nested statements, I would find it difficult to keep all the bracketing straight in my mind if the brackets were used in the way of the second method.  This method allows me to look straight up or down in a vertical line and identify where the loop/statement began or ended.  If they are placed in accordance to the second method, I have a more difficult time of doing that.  Ultimately, this is just my preference, and if this doesn't work for you, obviously go with your method.

COMMA FIRST, ARE YOU CRAZY?! GROSS"". It's rarely ever, ""oh, [weird|cool], you put the comma at the beginning of the line? Why?"" This could be a result of a number of things, from dogma being drilled into your head to lack of open-mindedness. So for the haters, let me explain.

Here's an example, starting with comma first:

    var obj1 = {
        prop1: 'x'
        , prop2: 'y'
        , prop3: 'z'
    };

    var obj2 = {
        prop1: 'a',
        prop2: 'b',
        prop3: 'c'
    };

On the surface, they don't really seem all that different and syntactically they are identical. At this point it's a matter of preference (I think comma separated looks nicer). However, let's say you add another property that is a function to your object, and put it somewhere in the middle:

    var obj1 = {
        prop1: 'x'
        , myMethod1: function(x) {
            //set some vars

            //magicks
            //10 more lines of code

            return x;
        }
        , prop2: 'y'
        , prop3: 'z'
    };


When you're going through your code looking for myMethod1, in comma-first notation, it is amazingly easy to discern between your properties when you can simply **scan everything that has a comma in front of it** like a bulleted list dictating where a property is defined. Sure, the first property doesn't have a comma in front, but it's also the first line of your object so you can't really miss it.

A side benefit of comma-first notation is that you never have to worry about forgetting your trailing comma at the end of your statement because in order to create a new property, you must start with a comma. Sure, if you add something to the beginning of your object or re-order your properties you have to remember to add a comma to your former first property, but it will be obvious that you forgot to do this because it will look funny sitting there in your property list with no comma in front.",,False,,t5_2wk7l,1362789359.0,,,True,t3_19xfoy,http://www.reddit.com/r/readablecode/comments/19xfoy/the_argument_for_commafirst_notation_in_javascript/,

    25. Choose a data representation that makes the program simple.
    26. Let the data structure the program.
    27. Make the coupling between modules visible.
    28. Each module should do one thing well.
    29. Make sure every module hides something.

This is a Scala solution to the following problem. I feel this could be a lot more readable while still maintaining the compactness but I'm not really sure what I could do (Other than someway to name the tuple indexes, but I'm not aware of a way to do that in Scala)

***Problem***

Given a string s, little Johnny defined the beauty of the string as the sum of the beauty of the letters in it.The beauty of each letter is an integer between 1 and 26, inclusive, and no two letters have the same beauty. Johnny doesn't care about whether letters are uppercase or lowercase, so that doesn't affect the beauty of a letter. (Uppercase 'F' is exactly as beautiful as lowercase 'f', for example.)

You're a student writing a report on the youth of this famous hacker. You found the string that Johnny considered most beautiful. What is the maximum possible beauty of this string?

Input sample:

Your program should accept as its first argument a path to a filename. Each line in this file has a sentence. e.g.

ABbCcc  
Good luck in the Facebook Hacker Cup this year!  
Ignore punctuation, please :)  
Sometimes test cases are hard to make up.  
So I just go consult Professor Dalves

Print out the maximum beauty for the string. e.g.

For a while I've been going back and forth in how I do my error handling. When I pick a style I stick with it for the entire library, but I've never really been sure of what's appropriate.

The two main methods I use are simply throwing exceptions, or defining a ""debug stream"" to which messages/warnings/errors are reported. For debug streams, it's usually customizable such that the user can define what actually happens. i.e. I have an ExceptionOutputStream, a ConsoleOutputStream, and a FakeOutputStream for starters.

I like to think that using a debug stream is preferable since an exception will crash the program, whereas a controlled output stream generally won't. (Uncaught exception will always crash, if you specify output to console/text file then there's no crash and the debug information is still recorded.)

These aren't all of the possible selectors, but rather an overview on how powerful they can be and how to implement some of them. If you are familiar with jQuery you probably know these, but it is still good to have for a reference. Even the smartest people need a sanity check.

To select all elements on the page that are within a paragraph tag:

    $('p')

To select all elements on the page with the CSS class 'active':

    $('.active')

To select the element with the ID 'container':

    $('#container')

To select all div elements with the class 'active':

    $('div.active')

To select all paragraph elements that is within a div with the class of 'active':

    $('div.active p')

To select the 4th list item from an unordered list (note that eq is zero-based):

    $('li:eq(3)')

You could also select the 4th item from an unordered list this way (not zero-based):

    $('li:nth-child(4)')

Select all descendants of an element with the class 'active' that has the class 'selection' then all descendants of the .selection class that are the second paragraph elements:

    $('.active .selection p:eq(1)')

Note that above, the space between each piece. The space means all descendants no matter their parent. Example:

    &lt;div class=""active""&gt;
        &lt;span class=""selection""&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;I won't be selected&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;I will be selected&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;div class=""buffer""&gt;
            &lt;span class=""choice""&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;I won't be selected&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Neither will I&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=""selection""&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;I won't be selected&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;I will be selected&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

There is the direct descendant selector. This tells jQuery to select only from the immediate child of the parent element:

    $('.active &gt; .selection p:eq(1)')

Here is the HTML from the previous example that shows what will be selected when using the direct descendant selector. Notice that only the .selection that is the first child of the .active will be selected:

    &lt;div class=""active""&gt;
        &lt;span class=""selection""&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;I won't be selected&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;I will be selected&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;div class=""buffer""&gt;
            &lt;span class=""choice""&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;I won't be selected&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Neither will I&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=""selection""&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;I won't be selected&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Neither will I&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

Lets say you have a bunch of div elements. Each will be assigned a CSS class based on their data. Your classes are DebitCash, DebitCard, CreditCash, CreditCard. You want to select all divs that have a class that begins with Debit:

    $('div[class^=""Debit""]')

Using the above example, now lets say there is also a class called DebitTotal. You now want to select all elements that begin with Debit or that have the class DebitTotal:

    $('div[class^=""Debit""], [class~=""DebitTotal""]')

When I pick a style I stick with it for the entire library, but I've never really been sure of what's appropriate.

The two main methods I use are simply throwing exceptions, or defining a ""debug stream"" to which messages/warnings/errors are reported. For debug streams, it's usually customizable such that the user can define what actually happens. i.e. I have an ExceptionOutputStream, a ConsoleOutputStream, and a FakeOutputStream for starters.

I like to think that using a debug stream is preferable since an exception will crash the program, whereas a controlled output stream generally won't. (Uncaught exception will always crash, if you specify output to console/text file then there's no crash and the debug information is still recorded.)

I think it's outright bad practise to do this, because of two things: First and most obvious; the unbalanced layout of brackets is visually harder to follow.  More importantly though, you've wasted the opportunity to create self documenting code by a meaningful naming of the delegate.

    Action postDoSomething = delegate()

Hopefully, this is the right place to post this!  The above class ends up getting used in many of my C++ projects.  What it does, is wrap up std::type_info&amp; in a form that can be used within map collections.  For example:
