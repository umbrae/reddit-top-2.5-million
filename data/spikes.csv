I'm not sure if it's my place to make this type of post, but I really care about the community and I'd regret it if I didn't at least try to say something about it. Here are some issues I find are causing this subreddit to seriously deteriorate:

1. **Decklists, everywhere.** I applaud the mods for making the ""Critique my Deck"" thread, but it just isn't working. Every day I see a new deck on the front page, ""Would this work, is this good, what do you recommend?"". Not only that, but I'm seeing non-competitive or budget decks being voted up and discussed. I often see good advice being downvoted, and bad advice being actively considered. I might be mistaken, but I never considered spikes a place to *feel good* or *be nice* - I saw it as the harsh but necessary advice. ""Your deck sucks, here's how I can help."" I've even seen bad standard combos being voted to the front page - I never thought that was spikes material.

2. **Community base seems divided.** I feel like there are two parties here. There is a large influx of players who aren't that good but are looking to actively improve their game or get valuable advice from us, and there are the tournament players who are looking for high-level discussion on topics with other tournament players. I feel that A) the lower level players are having too much influence on what is seen and discussed on the front pages by voting things up that shouldn't be voted up, and B) the tournament players are, in turn, becoming bitter and irritated and downvoting the crap out of everything. I've literally walked into one topic about a boros deck that was voted to 0, with the top voted comment mentioning that this type of post doesn't belong here and to post in the Critique Thread - and then, I've walked into a nearly identical topic about a boros deck that is voted to the front and a post suggesting the Critique Thread is at negative. Can we make up our freaking minds? What is this subreddit for? Does anyone know anymore?

My name is awjustaguy. I'm a competitive MTGO player and I am a spike. I enjoy deck brewing and high level tournament discussion. I do my best to contribute what knowledge I have to the community.

So if you have looked at the front page /r/spikes recently, you may be noticing a new trend: every single person with a fringe brew has decided to post their list and ask for suggestions. Unless I am mistaken, their reasoning is that us here in /r/spikes are more competitive than average, and therefore better than average, and so we're the guys to take your brews to. Here's the problem: this really isn't what this subreddit is about. We're here for competitive magic. That can include strategy tips, event reports, top 8 rundowns, and yes, the occasional competitive brew is fine. However, when every single post is asking ""Is this deck competitive playable enough? What should I change?"", the subreddit loses its meaning. Even worse, when people are scared to call the player out and say something like ""this deck has no chance of being constructed playable, don't waste your time"", then the subreddit has lost all of its point. When we share decklists here, it should not be because we want each other to tune up our decks that we know are less than optimal. It should be because we have tested the deck competitively, have gotten strong results (no, this doesn't mean you 3-1'd your FNM. It should mean you've either 3-1'd or 4-0'd several weeks in a row, or you did well at some competitive REL event), and want to share your success with others. Of course, this is only my opinion. If everyone else disagrees, then that's fine, I'll concede the point.

TL;DR: If you guys want to post decklists and ask experienced players if they're any good, create another subreddit for it. Don't clog this one with posts about clearly un-tuned or casual level decks, because that's not what this subreddit is for.

EDIT: A lot of great responses. Upon thinking about it for a bit, this seems like a problem that can be fixed very easily by a weekly thread. If anyone here is subscribed to /r/wearethemusicmakers, you may remember when the subreddit was flooded with posts asking people to critique their band's music. A weekly thread was established, and the problem was fixed. Mods, this is what I suggest, do what you will.

Hello all, I started playing Magic in this recent December, and soon got in to the competitive side. This weekend will be my first ever GP (Calgary), and I’ve been prepping for it hard on cockatrice and by lurking on this subreddit and mtgsalvation. For around 4-5 months (Once I learned that I didn’t really enjoy playing aggro all that much), I’ve been trying to pilot various BUG decks. It started with BUG Delver, in the weeks before RTR rotated. Due to some problems with the Jund matchup (Olivia Voldaren was a nightmare for the deck) which was quite popular at my LGS, I switched it to BUG Control. Over the months, I’ve been adding more and more planeswalkers, until I finally gave in and went all out, completely refitting the deck. Since that decision, I’ve been tweaking the deck almost non-stop for the month, and I feel like I actually have something manageable now. Despite all my effort, I still do realise that I am awful at this game. Any feedback on my deck or my reasoning would be greatly appreciated, and would most likely push discussion anyway. Thanks.


So, why BUG walkers? Well, simply, it’s the shard with the best planeswalkers currently in the format, Sorin and Domri notwithstanding (who don’t really fit in a Superfriends decks in the first place). Black, Green, and Blue are the colors that give us Lilianna of the Veil, Jace Architect of Thougt, Garruk Relentless, Tamiyo, and Vraska (as sideboard tech). The reason that we want to play planeswalkers is simple, they generate massive advantage as soon as they hit the table (we’ll touch more on this card per card later).
	

Of course, there is a weakness to doing Superfriends in BUG instead of colors like Esper or Bant. Notably, since we don’t have white, we miss out on the aforementioned Sorin, Lingering Souls, and the big one: Supreme Verdict. While we do have a board wipe in black (Mutilate), it’s tough to use in three colors. Much of the mana base we’re using is built around the problem that the swamp requirement that the card comes with. On the other hand, because we have mutilate we hit some creatures that wouldn’t regularly die with our mutilates. If for some reason we see a Predator Ooze (becoming more popular) or a Falkenrath Aristocrat, our trusty mutilate will do things no Verdict could ever do. Overall, I feel the deck is well-positioned in the current meta, and I’ll now tell you why.

**Planeswalkers**


Liliana of the Veil – Our resident black walker can be summed up as simply extremely threatening. Her sacrifice is obviously good against a variety of decks, Hexproof being a major one. It’s worth noting that you can purposely discard creatures if you need to pump up a Scavenging Ooze.

Jace, Architect of Thought – Basically, if I have a Thragtusk in hand, I like +1ing this guy on the turn he comes down for future protection. If I don’t or I really need an answer, I just go for the -2 to try and get what I need. Not much to say, as I just like to keep this guy as a recurring fact or fiction. Also hoses souls and assemble the legion, which is incredibly important.

Garruk Relentless – Simply excellent in the midrange and aggro matchups. In midrange he takes out mana dorks for our sac effects, fetches out our Progenitor Mimic to copy their Thragtusk, or takes out a Huntmaster of the Fells. In aggro it’s a token producer that they don’t like attacking in to, lest he flips. Awesome card in the deck.

Tamiyo, the Moon Sage – Has a few different uses. Most notably are keeping a troublesome creature or land down (looking at you, Kessig Wolf Run), drawing a ton of huge board states that just swung (the new green aggro deck). Simple, but effective.

**Creatures**

Scavenging Ooze – Obvious include. Hoses Junk Rites, does solid work against Aristocrats and aggro, and holds his weight in other matchups. So good it’s not even funny.

Thragtusk – Value town. Stabilises in a lot of different matchups, and protects planeswalkers exceptionally well. He’s also a very good target for Progenitor Mimic.

Progenitor Mimic – I have 1 in the mainboard and 1 in the sideboard, mostly as an answer to Midrange decks. He is beyond awful in top deck situations on empty boards, but if you can tutor him out when oyu have a Thragtusk, he’s a solid finisher. Against Jund and Junk Midrange, you can copy a Thrag, AoS or Huntmaster to turn around a game. I run one of him mainboard because I simply expect to see a lot of Jund midrange, and I like him against that deck.

Snapcaster Mage – I’m running him as a 2-of and not a 3-of simply because I don’t like having two of him and no instants or sorceries in my opening hand. Put simply, I just don’t run enough instants or sorceries to make more than 2 valuable in my deck.

Aetherling – Finisher for stalled board states, or if I have a Garruk that can fetch and 7 mana. Don’t like him as a 2 of, as I generally want to either fetch him or find him with Tamiyo or Jace.

**Instants/Sorceries**

Doom Blade – My go-to 2 mana removal spell. I used to have 3 of them, but moved one out for a syncopate for the r/g blitz decks for a syncopate (syncopate on bte is nasty).

Putrefy – Targeted non-black creature/artifact removal. The artifact mode hasn’t come up too often, except in some weird rogue trading post and Strionic resonator decks I’ve seen on cockatrice. Nevertheless, it notably hit’s hart to remove cards like Olivia Voldaren or Duskmantle Seer.

Psychic Strike – My main counter spell. Mostly running it due to dissipate being hard on mana at double blue, but the mill two is sort of helpful for Scavenging Ooze, and I don’t expect to see too much graveyard-interaction reliant decks at the GP I’m going to.

Far and Away – Another good removal spell. The sacrifice is good for Hexproof, which I expect to see a lot of at the GP. The bounce isalso good in some situations, but I mostly only use it when I’m fusing them together.

Syncopate – As earlier stated, I’m running this card basically for early game tempo. If I have this card and my opponent plays a BTE turn 2, it really undercuts his plan if that’s countered. 

Farseek – Running as a 3 of as I wanted more removal. Pretty integral to the deck, and I mostly search for either Overgrown Tomb or Watery Grave to pump up my Mutilates.

Mutilates – Our go to board wipe. Thankfully, most of the aggro decks are only running 1-2 toughness creatures mostly, so this is basically a Supreme Verdict most of the time.

**Land**

My land is mostly a standard mana base, but I’ve tweaked the deck continuously to around 4 swamps, which is performing well in testing to get Mutilates out for a good amount.

**Sideboard**

Pithing Needle – A very versatile card. In the Esper matchup I like brining it in against Jace, Nephalia Drownyard or Aetherling. Basically if I see a card that a deck really needs the activated ability of (some of those awful shadowborn apostle decks), I’ll bring this in.

Progenitor Mimic – I’ve already gone over why this card is good. I basically side it in, when I don’t sideboard the main one out.

Abrupt Decay – Has a few uses. Deals well with aggro decks, when I just need some extra removal. Deals decently with Hexproof, by destroying their Spectral Flight or Unflinching Courage so I can make a surprise block, and deals well with any deck that relies on O ring or D Sphere to remove my walkers.

Vraska the Unseen – Side it in when I need intangible removal. Doesn’t hit lands, which is why I’m considering replacing her with Acidic Slime, but I feel that her advantages (possible repeated removal, and the ability to remove planeswalkers) make her worth the spot. This is probably one of the cards I’m least sure about because of Acidic Slime potentially being better (I do think Tamiyo does a decent job at land hate already though).

Lifebane Zombie – The list of standard playable targets this guy hits is absurd, and is the reason he’s in my deck. In the right matchup, he’s practically a guaranteed two-for-one, which is amazing. His Intimidate ability has paid off well too.

Duress – Side it in in the matchups with not a lot of creatures (Esper being a big one). The uses here are fairly obvious, but I’m going to need to remember to write down what I see in their hand.

Appetite for Brains – Side it in in the matchups where there are a ton of CMC 4 or greater, or their big card costs 4 or greater. Run this mostly against Midrange and Control, but I might consider running this in a game 3 against aggro where I see a Burning Earth (as it does hit Hellrider as well as the Earth).

Ratchet Bomb – Fairly recent addition based on what I saw from Richmond. Notably, it kills the tokens of W/B Humans, the mana dorks in Garruk/Craterhoof deck, and a lot of the two drops in R/G Aggro. I can also pump it up in R/G aggro once I’ve stabilised just in case a Burning Earth comes down. Considering removing it for Curse of Death’s Hold for the matchups I talked about before, but I feel Ratchet Bomb is slightly better.

**Matchups**

**Jund**

-2 Doom Blade	

-2 Mutilate

-1 Jace

+1 Progenitor Mimic

+2 Appetite for Brains

+2 Lifebane Zombie


I feel I have a good matchup against Jund (won many matches in testing against it). Progenitor Mimic is an All-Star, so I feel that if I can get that out and protected, then I’ve got the game down. Scavenging Ooze mirrors makes the matchup a bit awkward at times (keep up the green mana, but don’t use it to exile until they tap out).

**Hexproof**

-1 Progenitor Mimic

-1 Doom Blade

-2 Putrefy	

+2 Abrupt Decay

+2 Ratchet Bomb

We have a good matchup against Hexproof pre-board with our sac effect in Far//Away and Liliana of the Veil, but abrupt decay for troublesome enchantments and Ratchet Bomb as an additional wrath make the matchup even better.

**Aggro**

-1 Progenitor Mimic

-2 Psychic Strike

-1 According to matchup 

+2 Ratchet Bomb

+2 Abrupt Decay


Thragtusk and Mutilate make this a pretty good matchup already. We take out Psychic Strike since it is a bit slow, and a counter on turn 3 doesn’t change their strategy much. Instead we want a counter on turn two with syncopate (if it’s in your opening hand), so be aware of having two mana up before passing it once you know they’re aggro. The card we take out is completely dependent on the matchup and color you face.


**Control**

-1 Progenitor Mimic

-1 Doom Blade

-4 Mutilate

+2 Duress

+2 Appetite for Brains

+2 Pithing Needle	

We are the beatdown in this matchup, and we need to play that way. Be very aggressive with what we play, but if they have 3 mana up, try baiting out their counters with another card before you put down a card like Garruk or Thragtusk, as these are the cards that’ll get us the game. Garruk is simply amazing post-board since a lot of esper players side out their verdicts for us. Pithing Needle is either used for Aetherling, Jace or Nephalia. Just because it costs 1 though, does not mean we need to put it down turn 1.

**W/B Humans**

-1 Progenitor Mimic

-1 Syncopate

-2 Psychic Strike

+2 Ratchet Bomb

+2 Abrupt Decay

This matchup is completely reliant on us drawing a wrath plus a removal. Our goal is to remove the Xathrid, and then go in for the mutilate or Ratchet Bomb. Honestly, this is a difficult matchup for us, but completely winnable.

**Mono Green Garruk/Hoof thing**


-1 Progenitor Mimic

-1 Lilianna of the Veil

-2 Putrefy

-2 Snapcaster

+2 Ratchet Bomb

+2 Abrupt Decay

+2 Pithing Needle


Matchup is fairly simple if we get a Mutilate, as the deck is fairly vulnerable in to overextending in to wraths. The two main problem cards are Predator Ooze and Silverheart, but fortunately Ooze dies to Mutilate, and Heart allows us to two for one in a few situations (doom blading or bouncing the Silverheart when they attack us).


**Wrap Up**

I think I’ve covered a basic overview of the BUG Superfriends decks. Again, I know I’m awful, and I would appreciate any feedback on the deck, and my reasoning. Thanks for reading!

EDIT: Thank you for all of the feedback! Here is the updated list with the 4th Farseek, an extra Aetherling, and 3 Think Twice. No more Progenitor Mimic, as I realized that Aetherling was simply just a better card 99% of the time. Unfortunately could not find a way to get Lifebane Zombie in the manboard, and I still sort of do think he fits in the sideboard.

&gt;When playing aggro, a deck will feel worse than it is; when playing control, a deck will feel better than it is.

&gt;I'm talking about feelings, so this won't apply to everyone, but I think, based on the reasoning, that it should apply to a lot of people.

&gt;When playing control, you spend a lot of time winning. If you lose, the game is over fairly painlessly in the first few turns, but when you win, you establish control and get to keep pulling further ahead over a very long game. When you win with aggro, the game is over in a few minutes, and when you lose, you sit there feeling helpless, hoping to draw several of your few powerful spells in a row to steal a game you've fallen behind in, which feels miserable.

&gt;If you choose a deck based on the amount of time you spend winning rather than the number of wins you get, this can lead to skewed deck selection.

I don't have this issue, but a couple of the guys I regularly play, test and travel with do. They're always trying to force control.dec when something else is clearly better - a problem I suspect a lot of experienced players have.

If you've been by spikes before you know I've done a good bit of posting here the last couple months - I really enjoy this subreddit as a whole. The mods asked if I'd be interested in doing an AMA - so here I am.

A bit of background on myself:

I've been playing Magic in a casual setting since 2000 and began playing competitively in early 2012. In the last year I've racked up six SCG Open series top 8s (two in standard and four in legacy). My first top 8 came during Scars block standard (at the height of UW delver) while playing a [BUG Control deck featuring Glissa the Traitor](http://sales.starcitygames.com//deckdatabase/displaydeck.php?DeckID=45346).

More recently I've top 8'd the last three SCG Opens I've played in (Legacy in Atlanta and Milwaukee and Standard in Milwaukee).

I just enjoy playing competitive Magic in general and enjoy myself even more when I can attack a format from a new/unexplored angle.

So, if people out there really have questions for me - go ahead and post'em below. I'll start answering things around 9pm EST.

**Round 1 - BR Midrange**

The first round was against another brew of sorts that I can only describe as “BR Good stuff”. It had a midrangy plan that consisted of lots of removal, Rakdo's Return and top ended into Thundermaw/Falkenrath.

I dominated game one with counter magic – throughly stopping his first six or so spells before sticking a Wolfir Avenger and riding it to victory. Game two he sqeaked in with an Aristocrat+Olivia on a Cavern of Souls. In game three I was able to push through a victory even with Caverns on dragon **and** vampire.

1 - 0

**Round 2 - Junk Reanimator**

Pretty stock Junk Reanimator list, piloted by a newer player.

I missed up pretty badly in game one and allowed him to squeak out a turn five Angel of Serenity (AoS) to which I promptly scooped. 

We then moved into what ended up being a forty minute game two during which my full set of side board Clones were all stars. He had two AoS, but I had two Clones. The difference is that my “Angels” only cost me four mana each to cast while his were costing him seven. This huge mana difference allowed me to grind out this very long game two.

Game three we presented with less than three minutes on the clock. My opponent however failed to shuffle his remove from game zone cards from our long game two back into his library. Because of this he was awarded a game loss for presenting an illegal deck.

2 - 0

**Round 3 - RG Aggro**

Lost the die roll for this matchup and my opponent had a turn one Arbor Elf into turn two Domri Rade. Domri then proceeded to do what he almost always does – absolutely nothing. Four +1's later my opponent had only drawn a single extra card from his three mana investment. RUG flash proceeded to do what it does best – chew up an aggro deck. Several removal spells and a couple of Huntmaster flips later game one closed out.

In game two I had my most glaring miss play of the day. My opponent had two Strangleroot Geists on board and as he moved to attackers I made a play on auto pilot, I had him hold at enter combat at which point I flashed in my Izzet Staticaster. Realizing my mistake (these guys have haste) I let him move to attackers – my opponent however had a Searing Spear to punish my mistake. I opt'd to “kill” both Geists with the Staticaster in response. So instead of fogging an attack step I've now taken six points of damage.

I won game two with one hit point – sometimes better lucky than good.

3 - 0

**Round 4 - Jund Midrange**

I really like RUG's Jund Midrange matchup. Their spell/mana base is setup in such a way that they generally can't play Cavern of Souls. This means that we have more counter magic/answers than they do relevant threats. I closed this round out in two fairly uninteresting games.

4 - 0

**Round 5 - Wolfrun Bant**

Our game one was a great game of magic. He had several Thragtusks into an Angel of Serenity, but I had a pair of Huntmasters that did the flippy-floppy for almost six straight turns in a row. This game ended with almost a dozen wolves on my side of the table. 

Game two was far less stimulating. He mulliganed to six keeping a hand with only GW mana and no farseeks. To compound things further he then missed his 5th land drop. The game ended soon there after.

5 - 0

**Round 6 - Esper Control**

I won the die roll here and after my opponent failed to play an Augur of Bolas on turn two I had my Snapcaster Mage do it's best Ambush Viper impersonation at the end of his second turn. That Snapcaster was able to sneak in ten points of damage before he finally spent a card to kill it – I was able to eek in the last ten points with a pair of Yeva's (one at a time) protected by some counter magic.

I am on the draw for game two and mulligan a one land seven, one land six and then keep a one land five. I scooped to his turn 5 Jace with just a single land in front of me still. I then proceeded to take game three on the play.

6 - 0

**Round 7 - Mike Nyberg with GR Brunch**

Mike is a friend of mine and he was my first loss in the swiss at this event. If you go back through the SCG coverage for the weekend this was a feature match on camera. He is playing what my group likes to call a “brunch” deck – not quite aggro, but not quite lunch either. Our game one is fairly interactive, but he ends up taking it down.

Game two he hits four land + a mana dork and powers out five drop after five drop. I on the other hand end up with nine lands on the table and four more in hand. The game ends shortly there after. Mike goes on to win his next round as well and double draws into top 8.

6 - 1

**Round 8 - GW Midrange**

In game one my opponent mulligans to five on the play and runs out of gas long before I run out of answers. In game two we play a fairly interactive game during which I have a solid answer for every play he tries to make. At one point I snuck in a Wolfir Avenger and rode it home.

7 – 1

**Round 9 – Bant Reanimator**

This deck was really interesting – it was a Bant deck splashing black for Unburial Rites and utilizing Tracker's Instincts for digging/filling up the yard. It also contained Farseek for ramp.

In game one the only real piece of action he found was a pair of Loxodon Smiters, backed up by a pair of Unburial Rites. While that may not sound like much a 4/4 can be a real brick wall at times for the RUG deck. Eight Huntmaster flips later I was able to alpha strike with a pack of wolves for lethal.

Game two was awkward on both sides. We both stalled on three lands and then recovered at similar times. Thankfully I was able to stick a Wolfir Avenger before he played anything relevant I needed to answer. I then countered a bunch of his spells while beating down with my 3/3.

8 - 1

**Round 10 – Sam Black with Act 2**

I can ID this round and be a lock for top 8. Sam on the other hand can lose this round and still make it. He isn't familiar with the deck I am playing at all and tells me he wants to play out this last round. I have a very sub-par draw in game one and get throughly crushed. Game two I have a fairly good hand, but get punished by his one-of Cavern of Souls. He has lethal on the table in game two and then offers me the draw.

Good guy Sam Black – even if he did make me sweat it out.

8 – 1 – 1

**Quarter Finals – Sam Black Again**

Turns out that drawing with Sam put me at the top of the 8 – 1 – 1s after swiss so I am the fifth seat – this means I am playing Sam again in the quarters.

This match was featured on camera – so check the twitch.tv archive for full footage. I was however able to turn the tables after getting crushed in round 10 – on the draw I am able to take this match down in two games.

9 – 1 – 1

**Semi Finals – Jund**

Brian ended up winning the whole event. This round was covered both on the stream and with written coverage [here](http://www.starcitygames.com/events/coverage/semifinals_jeff_hoogland_vs_br.html).   The tl/dr read version is that I took game one, got buried by an Underworld Connections in game two, and failed to find a sixth land for ~6 draws to lose game three.

9 – 2 – 1

**Wrap Up**

Over all I was fairly pleased with both my own play and the performance of the deck throughout the course of the event. Not only was it a blast to play, but it felt fairly powerful in a number of match ups. I was pleased with my card selection over all and I'm not sure I'd change anything in my 75 moving forward. 

I would just like to comment on my use of Curse of Echoes in my sideboard before I end this post though (gotten the most questions about that one). This was a last minute change that I still do not have positive or negative feelings about after the event. In all past events these slots had been Garruk, Primal Hunters. UWr Flash however is a fairly rough matchup for RUG though and I think curse is just a far stronger card against UWx decks than Garruk is (as it copies their relevations and turns off their counter magic). You know from reading this post though that I didn't play against UWr in Milwaukee though – so I'm still not sure how I feel about this change over all.

For those who want one I've written up a sideboarding guide [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/1cgkus/standard_sideboarding_with_rug_flash/).

A question for folks who read these things – is it worth while for me to do another event summary about the Loam deck I rode into a top 8 for the third time now or have you all read enough about that list?

Thanks for reading and happy flashing!

1366991357.0,67,self.spikes,1d5r81,[Standard] Is Voice of Resurgence relevant?,76,9,45,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/1d5r81/standard_is_voice_of_resurgence_relevant/,"*(Disclaimer: This is a speculative article, and a bit different from the usual threads. Hope you enjoy it.)*

On paper, [Voice of Resurgence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=368951) is clearly a powerful card. This isn't just because it's a 2/2 for two with a unique, strong ability. It's because, as Craig Wescoe succinctly explained in [his recent article](http://magic.tcgplayer.com/db/article.asp?ID=11135), VoR does work against three of the major archetypes: aggro, midrange, and control.

Specifically: Against Blitz-style aggro, it trades for a 2/2 on the ground and gives you another creature to trade or chump with in the future. Against midrange, it imitates Thragtusk and provides two threats in one card. Against control, it does punishes a number of commonly-played instants (Azorius Charm, Think Twice, Sphinx's Revelation) and continues its Thragtusk impression.

How about removing it? Well, it does die to pretty much everything in the format -- but unless you want to turn VoS into a pair of 2/2 Elemental tokens (or worse), you'll have to use your removal during your own turn. That's not too bad for a two-mana investment.

That about covers the card's strengths. How about his weaknesses?

First of all, just to get out if the way: yes, he dies to Pillar of Flame. At a measly one mana, Pillar is looking like a very reasonable card right now, as it deals well with decks from last season (particularly Naya Humans and any of the decks running mana dorks). It's also a good, proactive hedge against decks that update themselves for Dragon's Maze with Voice of Resurgence or Blood Scrivener/Zombies.

Beyond that, Voice of Resurgence's biggest weakness is...he's a 2/2 for 2, which means he competes with one of the most import cards in the format: Farseek. The opportunity cost of playing Voice over Farseek is huge.

With that in mind, let's go back to talking about VoR's performance against the three big archetypes.

If you're using the Voice solely to trade against aggro, he's really just a bad Lingering Souls that can't fly and has a strict color requirement. He comes down a turn earlier, though, which is helpful.

 Against midrange, turn 2 Voice of Resurgence doesn't stack up well if your opponent goes T1 dork, T2 Loxodon Smiter. Similarly problematic is T2 Farseek, T3 Olivia/Huntmaster/Falkenrath. He also gets totally bricked by Boros Reckoner, which chumps his front half all day and probably trade up with his back half.

Versus control, he gains a lot of value just by virtue of disrupting their tempo (and making counters terrible), but a 10-turn clock isn't super intimidating. And unless your other threats are indestructible (Tajic? Falkenrath?) against their sweepers, a 1/1 Elemental isn't going to end games anytime soon. He also does nothing against Terminus, which is unfortunate. Finally, Sphinx's Revelation is still a very good card at sorcery-speed -- or maybe the control player just doesn't care about the token when they're wrathing the board on your next main phase anyway.

Given all this, I currently think that Voice of Resurgence's closest comparison isn't Thragtusk, but rather Thalia. Both of them are 2-drops with relevant bodies and disruptive text boxes that have a lot of value early, but become less valuable later. This pretty much encapsulates the definition of an aggro card.

I think he fits best in an aggro shell that doesn't mind spending its turn 2 on a resilient and disruptive threat that has a decent percentage against the entire field. Unfortunately, he plays very awkwardly with the best aggro deck in the format (Naya Blitz), since he's not Human and can't be cast off of Burning-Tree Emissary.

How about other decks? As I alluded to earlier, I feel like midrange decks would generally prefer to just Farseek into a 4-drop. (This could change if midrange decks dropped Farseek in favor of more dorks, but that seems unlikely to me, and is a whole other discussion regardless.) However, his back half works extremely well with Trostani; Junk tokens or even just Junk with a small token subtheme could definitely do a lot of good work with him.

Where else might he fit? Well, he will almost certainly find a home in Bant Hexprpof, where he seems to be a straight up upgrade for Selesnya Charm and/or Strangleroot Geist; but whether that will actually be a Tier 1 strategy remains to be seen. As a midrange/control card, he's not awful in Bant, but that deck is also very mana hungry and probably just wants to Farseek too.

All that said, he's a great sideboard hatebear against decks trying to cast Sphinx's Revelation (or Fog) while they continually wrath the board. He will see play...but I don't think he'll be as good in Standard as he might first appear to be.

He might actually be *better* in a format like Modern (or possibly even Legacy), where 2 drops are more important and mana ramp is much less of a problem. He does a great job beating up other ""fair"" decks, and also gains value against any deck that wants to cantrip, dig, or use countermagic on their opponent's turns.

So, to recap: yes, Voice of Resurgence is abstractly strong against many different decks. He *will* see play, in some maindecks and many sideboards. But he's only a 2-drop, and the format is currently filled with decks whose game plans involve ignoring the 2-drop spot and racing to slam 3's and 4's or cheat 7's and 8's into play. That's not a good world for the Voice to really shine.

What do you think? Agree, disagree, too early to say? Let me know in the comments!

The moderators, over the past week, have been discussing ways to reduce some of the problems seen over the past few months, along with discussing how to best implement the feedback given to us through our recent thread.  After discussing these things, we have decided to re-write several of our rules, and institute a new weekly thread (in addition to Winning Wednesdays).  
  
---------------------------------------------------------  
  
**FIRST: A new thread, entitled ""Budget Beater!,"" will be made each Monday.  This weekly thread will give competitive players the opportunity to discuss decks within specific budgets that *still contribute to a competitive atmosphere*.  This is NOT a place for brews that are made only because you can't afford a playset of Voice of Resurgence (or some other high dollar card) and want a replacement.  Mods will be monitoring the thread, and letting readers know if something is a bit...shady.**  
  
-------------------------------------------------------  
  
**SECOND!  See below for the new layout of our subreddit rules. They will be added to the sidebar by the end of the day today.  If you have questions, message the mods.  Most of these changes were made to clarify grey areas, but to also give you all a greater sense of what we want and don't want on here.**  
  
-------------------------------------------------------------------  
*New Subreddit Rules:*  
  
1.  **Constructive criticism(s) only**. Derogatory comments that add nothing to the conversation and/or comments without rationale will be removed without warning.  
  
2.  Only competitive decks, or decks that are built with competitive (NOT FNM) play in mind are to be considered. If you post a ""rogue"" deck, be prepared with sufficient rationale as to why your deck is competition-worthy in the current meta for your deck's format (as in, post more than 75 cards and a ""Please critique"" plea!). Rogue decks, without a primer or rationale, **will** be removed.  We welcome ideas, but we require substance.  
  
3.  Non-deck magic discussion must be had with competition in mind (i.e. psychological factors, tips for tournament preparation). Any posts of a non-competitive nature will be removed.  
  
4.  Budget-based competitive discussion is **ONLY** to take place in our ""Budget Beater"" thread posted weekly, and **MUST** relate to competitive Magic. Any other budget discussion, regardless of the nature or good-will of the discussion, **will** be removed without warning.  
  
5.  **Keep downvotes to a minimum** - unless something is spam or trolling, leave it alone. Do not downvote bad advice - rather, post about why it is bad and provide a solution.  
  
6.  **Tag posts for formats** - There are link flair options - use them. Posts that are not flaired or tagged will be flaired, and a warning will be sent to the user.  
  
7.  When discussing changes to an established deck in a format's metagame, *be prepared to discuss your rationale for doing so.* Otherwise, the post and deck may be removed without warning.  
  
8.  When posting a tournament report, it must be from a Competitive REL event or higher.  If discussing an event on MTGO, please only report on similar competitive play (Premier Events, GPTs, and PTQs).  Consistently high results in other MTGO events (i.e. Daily events) may also be discussed, but please be detailed!  FNM Reports, FNM Hero-like posts, and posts that do not merit discussion and/or are not meaningful to a spike's development as a player will be removed.  
  
9.  Continued violations of any of these rules *will result in a temporary, or, in serious cases, permanent ban* from the community.  
  
----------------------------------------------------------  
  
Hopefully, these rules updates make sense to you.  If you are for whatever reason confused, please, PLEASE contact the mod team.  We're here to help.  
  
I would like to point out that Mods will be taking on a more strict moderating role, now that the rules are a bit more fleshed out.  We're not trying to target any particular post, idea, vision, etc.  We want to make sure that /r/spikes is a one-stop shop for the competitive player while providing substantive, quality information.  
  
Feel free to provide suggestions, etc.  Thanks everyone!

This means even when I start events 2-2 or 3-3 I keep playing until there is a zero percent chance of me winning something.

And you know what? The number of 2-2 starts I've ground out to 6-2 and 7-2 finishes are many. I also believe my better performance in other events can easily be tied to this extra playing.

What is spike's opinion on dropping from events once you are ""out of top 8 contention""? As I indicated above - I think this is foolish. Am I alone in this line of thought?

1369753373.0,68,self.spikes,1f7a1q,[Standard] RUG Flash Update in DGM Standard,77,9,74,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/1f7a1q/standard_rug_flash_update_in_dgm_standard/,"Okie dokie folks - I've had a number of people asking for some updated content with regards to the standard deck I've been playing for the last couple months now - RUG Flash. This post is intended for folks who want to think about their selections. For those who just want to copy a 75 and start playing you can always find my latest deck [here](http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/magic-carpet/).

I've waited until now to post something because I wanted to prove to myself this arch type was still worth playing with the release of DGM - and I believe it is. I've played the in three large events since rotation with the following results:

* 200~ man PTQ, 6-2 for 19th place
* 450~ man SCG Open, 7-2-1 for 21st place
* 150~ man PTQ - 7-2 for 5th place

As I believe my results show - this arch type is competitive in addition to the crazy amounts of fun it is to play.

Instead of posting a specific deck list, I'm instead going to talk about card selection - since certain slots are flexible and should change as the metagame heads in certain directions.

**Threats:**

These are what we close the game out with. I've been playing with the following threat base I believe it is what you want to be playing:

* 4 [Huntmaster of the Fells](http://tappedout.net/mtg-card/huntmaster-of-the-fells/)
* 3 [Snapcaster Mage](http://tappedout.net/mtg-card/snapcaster-mage/)
* 4 [Wolfir Avenger](http://tappedout.net/mtg-card/wolfir-avenger/)
* 4 [Yeva, Nature's Herald](http://tappedout.net/mtg-card/Yeva-Natures-Herald/)

People always ask about Thragtusk (and now Atherling). I've played with both these cards and they feel out of place in this shell. I wouldn't play them main deck.

**Counter Magic:**

The reason this deck is so powerful is because we can play counter magic without being punished. I recommend the following counter suite:

* 3 [Dissipate](http://tappedout.net/mtg-card/dissipate/)
* 3 [Syncopate](http://tappedout.net/mtg-card/syncopate/)
* 1 [Izzet Charm](http://tappedout.net/mtg-card/izzet-charm/)

If you feel your metagame calls for more counter magic than what is listed above I've played up to three Izzet Charm main at certain points and this is a fine choice. It is a very flexible card that is rarely a dead draw.

Other cards that get mentioned a lot are Rewind and now Plasm Capture. While Rewind is a fine spell for heavy Midrange/Control meta games, I feel the amount of aggro decks doing well at SCG Opens/PTQs make it a poor choice for this deck currently (four mana is a LOT more than 3).

Plasm Capture just isn't want this deck wants to be doing at all. The point of that card is to slam bombs - something we do not do.

**Removal:**

You should be playing a minimum of 10 pieces of spot removal. Which pieces you play should depend on what decks you are expecting to play against. You should have some combination of the following:

* [Izzet Charm](http://tappedout.net/mtg-card/izzet-charm/)
* [Searing Spear](http://tappedout.net/mtg-card/Searing-Spear/)
* [Turn / Burn](http://tappedout.net/mtg-card/turn-burn/)
* [Mizzium Mortars](http://tappedout.net/mtg-card/Mizzium-Mortars/)
* [Pillar of Flame](http://tappedout.net/mtg-card/pillar-of-flame/)

**Utility Cards/Lands:**

I feel the following are must includes:

* [Think Twice](http://tappedout.net/mtg-card/think-twice/)
* [Desolate Lighthouse](http://tappedout.net/mtg-card/desolate-lighthouse/)

Think Twice is both a straight forward source of card advantage, a method of flipping Huntmaster back, and helps hit early land drops when we are stumbling. You want 2-3 of this card (4 is too clunky)

I firmly believe at this point that Desolate Lighthouse is the correct utility land for RUG Flash to be playing. Essentially it allows you to turn every land you draw after your 7th or 8th into a spell - which is a powerful ability to have. I've taken to playing 23 duals and 2 loothouse in my main deck.

**Sideboard Selection:**

Again, side board is a moving target depending on what you are expecting to play against in a given event. Any/all of the following are fine side board choices I feel:

*Clones:*

* [Clone](http://tappedout.net/mtg-card/clone/)
* [Progenitor Mimic](http://tappedout.net/mtg-card/progenitor-mimic/)

Pretty sure you want a mix of Clone effects. I've been playing 4-5 clones in my board since Dragon's Maze released and they make reanimator a pretty easy match up. 4 mana VS 6 is a big difference though - so I think you want a split on these guys.

*Supplemental Removal:*

* [Mizzium Mortars](http://tappedout.net/mtg-card/Mizzium-Mortars/)
* [Pillar of Flame](http://tappedout.net/mtg-card/pillar-of-flame/)
* [Turn / Burn](http://tappedout.net/mtg-card/turn-burn/)

Just like the main deck, should change based on what you are expecting to see.

*Unsummon Effects:*

* [Cyclonic Rift](http://tappedout.net/mtg-card/cyclonic-rift/)
* [Unsummon](http://tappedout.net/mtg-card/unsummon/)

The main reason to play Rift over just Unsummon is that Rift can bounce enchantments. This is a really nice ""getcha"" when they attack in with their suited up Giest of St. Truck.

*Sweepers:*

* [Electrickery](http://tappedout.net/mtg-card/electrickery/)
* [Rolling Temblor](http://tappedout.net/mtg-card/rolling-temblor/)
* [Magmaquake](http://tappedout.net/mtg-card/Magmaquake/)

Electrickery is nice for killing Invisible Stalkers before the suit up and has the nice ability of killing most turn 1 plays out of aggro decks.

The discussion here is really Magmaquake VS Rolling Temblor. I'm currently thinking Rolling Temblor is the card you want - for two reasons.

1.) It flashes back. This makes 2 for 1s or better a lot more common with this card when you get the game to go long.

2.) It allows you to kill a turn 2 Giest on the play or a turn 3 Giest on the draw.

I really hate losing to Giest.

*Control Hate:*

UWx decks have been less popular of the late and I personally do not think they are a super good metagame choice (obviously this varies from week to week). Thankfully, if this changes we have a number of good tools to fight these arch types:

* [Counterflux](http://tappedout.net/mtg-card/counterflux/)
* [Curse of Echoes](http://tappedout.net/mtg-card/curse-of-echoes/)

Both these cards allow you combat Revelations in nice ways. 

* [Garruk, Primal Hunter](http://tappedout.net/mtg-card/garruk-primal-hunter/)
* [AEtherling](http://tappedout.net/mtg-card/aetherling/)

These are hard to deal with threats that can close a game out on their own.

*Misc:*

* [Dissipate](http://tappedout.net/mtg-card/dissipate/)
* [Ground Seal](http://tappedout.net/mtg-card/ground-seal/)

Ground Seal is primarily extra reanimator hate and Dissipate does double duty of being good VS reanimator and being extra counter magic for the control/midrange match ups.

**Wrap Up:**

Hopefully you all learned something about my favorite standard deck. Have any questions/comments feel free to drop them below.

See yall in Chicago for the WMCQ this weekend.

Each Player can control the same Legendary Permanent. Legendary Rule only applies to a player controlling two of that permanent. For example, both players can control a Geist simultaneously. 

This also applies to Planeswalkers as well. Both players can now control a JTMS at the same time. 

Also there have been revisions made to sideboarding:
""We're also making an adjustment to sideboard composition in Constructed tournaments. Previously, your main deck was sixty or more cards and your sideboard was either fifteen cards or zero cards, indicating you weren't using a sideboard. With the new rule, your main deck is still sixty or more cards but your sideboard is now up to fifteen cards. Additionally, you are not required to swap cards between your main deck and sideboard on a one-for-one basis. For Games 2 and 3 (and so on), as long as your main deck is sixty or more cards and your sideboard is no more than fifteen cards, you're good. This change makes sideboarding in Constructed and in Limited closer.

1363015614.0,60,self.spikes,1a33db,[Legacy] Third at SCG Indy - Report,70,10,54,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/1a33db/legacy_third_at_scg_indy_report/,"Howdy All,

This is a report from the SCG Legacy open in Indy this past weekend that had over 300 people – I finished third. You can find my deck list with a deck tech [here](http://www.starcitygames.com/events/coverage/deck_tech_4_color_loam_with_je.html). This list is what my friends and I refer to as the ""Norton Special"" - he is the man that designed the core of the list. I've changed maybe 5~ cards from the 75 he gave me.

I’ve posted a few things around here before. I’m what you could call a Midwest grinder, this makes for my third SCG Open top 8 (second in legacy). I’ve also top 64’d an SCG invitational and have too many top 64s  on the open circuit to count at this point (I’m also really good at x-2ing modern PTQs). I enjoy playing decks that allow me to confuse the other player slightly with some non-standard card choices.

**Round 1 – No Side Board Burn**

Sometimes rounds 1-2 can be a bye at these things. My round one opponent sat down across from me and set his deck face up on the table for all to see – Chain Lightning. We shuffle and cut, my opening 7 is perfect – two land, mox diamond, chalice of the void and three cards that aren’t terribly relevant. He wins the die roll and bolts me to 17, I untap and slam a chalice on one. The game ends a few turns later after I stick a Knight.

Game 2, I mulligan till I have a turn 2 chalice. Things go as planned.

1 – 0

**Round 2 – Adam Prosak with ANT**

This is one of those times where keeping up with the SCG circuit paid off. Prosak sits down across from me and I put him on ANT even though I haven’t seen him play yet today. I win the die roll and mulligan aggressively on the play, I get a chalice in my 5 card hand. He cabal therapies me on his turn one and I see his eyes get wide when he sees my turn 2 chalice (he missed with the therapy). A few turns later I beat him down with a Knight.

Game 2. I probably should have mulliganed some more. I also miss-sideboarded and brought in both my thoughtseize by mistake. I might have been able to pull this game out if I had left a thoughtseize in my SB to burning wish for on turn 3.

Game 3. I act like a good magic player and mulligan aggressively again – I am rewarded for my troubles. I go to 5 on the play again, but this time I have three land, chalice and a mox diamond. I chalice for one on turn 1 and pass, my next two draws are Knight, followed by a second chalice which I promptly place on zero. He dies 4 turns later to a 5/5 Knight.

2 – 0

**Round 3 – RUG Delver**

I don’t recall the exact specifics of our game 1 – I just remember he didn’t have a threat in his opening hand, shuffled a bunch of ponders and later had his Goyf get out raced by my Knight. Game two he kept a greedy one lander and opted to play a delver on turn one. I promptly wastelanded him and then killed his delver a couple of turns later with a punishing fire. He didn’t make a second land drop till at least turn 6 – far too late.

3 – 0

**Round 4 – Camera Match with Goblins**

Variance caught up with me in game one of this match. I have one land in my 7 and then no lands in my 6, 5, and 4 card hands. I keep my four because I am on the draw. I lose to a bunch of goblins a few turns later with only one land in play.

Games two and three I Devastate his Dreams – in the most literal sense. I’ve yet to lose a match to goblins with this list – and this round was no exception. I stick a knight and cast DD for 3+ cards at least once in both of the last games. In game two I killed him in one shot with a 19/19 Knight.

4 – 0

**Round 5 – Maverick**

He wins the die roll and I mulligan to 6. He leads out with cavern of souls on humans into Nobel Hiarch. I draw my card for the turn and decide to be aggressive. I play a land, drop a mox diamond and cast devastating dreams for 1 on my first turn. The three cards in my hand when I discard one at random are two lands and a dark confidant. I manage to keep my dark confidant. His second turn he drops a wasteland and passes – I know I am in good shape. Confidant draws me too many cards before he can find his way to colored mana.

Game 2. We have this really awkward board stall that I can’t find a DD to break. I did however draw all four Knights – they ran him over.

5 - 0

**Round 6 – Alex Binek with UWr Control**

Binek is a good friend of mine and we are one of the only top tables not called over to the feature match area. I can only describe our match as a grindy 50 minute troll fest. I had some very timely abrupt decays to kill his counter balances and a RIP in game one. In the second game I was able to bait a FoW with a dark confidant and then stick a game winning devastating dreams. I always hate beating a friend so late in an event, but it all worked out because Binek won his next two to make top 8 with me.

6 - 0

**Round 7 – Eric Riley with NO Elf Ball**

Eric is a very good player – he has top 8s under his belt wielding his legacy weapon of choice (Elves). Thankfully creature decks without counter magic have a VERY poor DD match up. Not going to lie, I miss played a LOT in our first game (but hey, this was my 18th round of magic in 48 hours), but my punishing fires are able to get me there. 

Game 2. I messed up again – I forget that elf ball now plays NO as a finisher. I boarded out my Gaddock Teeg. Whoops. He kills me very dead with a Progenitus while I fail to find white mana for the Retribution of the Meek I found with my burning wish. 

Game 3. I fix my side boarding mistake and bring back in my main deck Sir Teeglesworth along with my sideboard copy. On the play I put him into a “soft lock” with double chalice on 1 into Teeg. I eventually beat him down with my bear.

7 – 0

**Rounds 8/9**

The next two rounds I ID with RUG delver and twelve post. These are both fairly good matchups and I want them in the top 8 with me. Swiss record 7 – 0 – 2. I’ve only dropped three games all day – one of which I mulliganed out of. I’m feeling good. Entering top 8 as the third seat, which means I get to play in the quarter finals.

**Quarter Finals – Twelve Post**

This matchup isn’t close – watch the camera coverage if you don’t believe me. Game one I have turn 1 dark confidant off of a wasteland and a mox diamond. Game two I’m not nearly as explosive, but my opening 7 has two wastelands, two other lands and a loam in it. He mulliganed to six and didn’t get to do much that game. It ended with no permanents on his side of the table. His deck has three pithing needles main deck and a fourth in the board. I’m not sure why he didn’t mulligan more to find one – I’m not sure I’d have won if that had been his turn 1 play naming wasteland.

**Semi Finals – Binek Again**

We prize split the top 4. I was fairly giddy with excitement, lack of sleep, and my twentieth round of magic in 48 hours. I don’t think I should really call what Binek and I played on camera magic though. It really resembled more a game of soccer where he and I punted a ball back and forth to each other. I haven’t checked the twitter feedback yet from that match – but I’m sure it isn’t very kind. He punted game one to me, I punted game two to him and game three he helm combo’d me out of the game. The entirety of the match myself, Binek and the handful of judges remaining were laughing pretty hard while Alex and I trolled each other in both subtle and obvious ways. Easily the most fun I’ve had playing magic ever.

**Wrap Up**

So over all I went 8 – 1 – 2 in matches for the day. I was pleased with my play for most of the day and I have a nice check coming in the mail to pay for future magical trips.

Thanks for reading this wall of text – feel free to drop any questions below as comments.

I was really happy with my 75 all day. Going into a diverse field of match ups I believe I would play the same list again in a heart beat. That being said - I do tweak based on the meta game I expect. For instance if I am expecting more grindy/fair decks I generally cut the second GSZ for a Volrath's Stronghold for more late game creatures. A Scavaging Ooze also bounces in and out of the 75 based on how many graveyard decks are running around and the number of creatures seeing play.

Taking a nod from the successful ""Tutor Tuesdays"" over at /r/magictcg, we spikes have decided to begin our own series of ""Ask us anything"" posts.  Every Wednesday is your chance to ask that question that's been bugging you without fear of downvotes, ridicule, etc...as long as it involves something relating to a spike (Yes, you can even ask what a Spike is...although I assume you know that at this point!).  
  
The Moderators came to the conclusion that we needed a weekly thread to 1) benefit the group as a whole, and 2) reduce the number of similar posts we see on a daily basis that can be rectified with a weekly thread.  Much like the deckbuilding posts of old, we'll put a sticky on the sidebar for easy access.  
  
Here are a set of general courtesies when posting here, paraphrased from /u/bokchoykn in /r/magictcg):  
    
- Ask thought-provoking questions.   
  
- Tell us very specifically about what you want.   
  
- Be open to any suggestions.   
  
- Remember that, in the end, this isn't /r/magictcg.  Please gear your questions towards a competitive, play-to-win audience.  After all, that's what we're all about!

Sometimes you have a weekend where you make all the correct plays and still fall short of your goals. I wish I could say my weekend in Nashville was one of those weekends - but sadly it was not. I had some glaring misplays and over the course of the weekend I managed to fall short in not one, not two, but three ""win and in"" matches for top 8s. 

That being said - any weekend I get to spend playing magic is a great one. Even after being sick for over a week (with almost no voice!) I managed to put up two top 32 finishes this weekend.

I'll talk about specific card selection and things I'd change after I talk a bit about the rounds I played.

**Round 1 - Evan with Jund**

So one of the things I've discovered is that the more people who know my name, the more people there are who know what I am likely playing when I sit down. Evan was a nice guy (who also top 8'd legacy on Sunday - congrats Evan) who knew what I was playing as soon as I sat down.

Jund is something I consider to be a fairly good match up for RUG. We have more counter magic and removal than they do threats. Our added access to Turn / Burn allows us to care very little about the Cavern of Souls Jund is now playing. 

The one of Cyclonic Rift I added to my board the day before the event really did work in this match up. It works well for resetting an Olivia that has grown too large and at one point I was able to bounce a resolved Sire in response to its trigger.

I won this round in three fairly tight games.

1 - 0

**Round 2 - RG Aggro**

Not much to say about this round. He possibly should have mulliganed his hand in the first game. I won this round 2-0

2 - 0

**Round 3 - Junk Reanimator**

In game one this round my opponent kept what I like to refer to as a ""guild gate"" hand - meaning his first two lands entered the battlefield tapped. On his turn three a well placed Izzet Charm countered a Mulch. He didn't make a third land drop that turn. By the time he finally hit his third and fourth lands I was far enough ahead that it didn't matter.

In our second game I mulliganed to six, got stuck on two land, and had my hand ripped apart by a combination of Sin Collector and Restoration Angel. Eventually I hit my third and fourth lands, but I lacked a second green mana still and was unable to catch back up.

In the third game he mulliganed to five on the draw, but still put up a heck of a fight with a Sin Collector off of Cavern of Souls. Back to back Huntmasters on turns four/five were enough to put this game away.

3 - 0

**Round 4 - Big Naya**

I'm still torn on if big Naya is a good or bad match up for RUG (need to play test it some more that is for sure). I was able to handle his larger threats with counter magic and then mopped up the Loxodon Smiters that slipped through the cracks with Mizzium Mortars and Yevas. I won this match up 2-0

4 - 0

**Round 5 - Bant Hexproof**

This was a camera match you can find in the SCG Archives. I'd just like to talk about one play I had in our second game that was... Greedy to say the least. 

My opponent had spent his second and third turns playing Invisible Stalkers. I was feeling good with the Electrickery in my hand - but a two for one wasn't good enough for me. I wanted to three for one this card. I let my opponent untap and start his fourth turn. When he cast a Spectral Flight targeting one of his stalkers I responded with an overloaded Electrickery.

I got blown out by a negate. Thankfully I was able to race the pair of Invisible Stalkers and take this match up 2-0

5 - 0

**Round 6 - Ben Weinberg with Naya Blitz**

Generally, I think Blitz is a good match up for RUG Flash. In our first game, though, I failed to play around a Giant Growth and ended up taking ten extra points of damage on an attack because of it. That game didn't last much longer.

On the play for game two, I was able to one for one him a bunch before sticking a Huntmaster which promptly ate his team.

I've been thinking a lot about the seven cards I kept in this game. On the draw I kept:

* Cyclonic Rift
* Searing Spear
* 2 Huntmaster of the Fells
* 3 lands that provide all my colors

This hand seems sweet, right? I get to put off his turn two/three plays before curving into a pair of Huntmasters. What I didn't consider was the play that beat me - a turn two Thalia. With that in mind, perhaps I should have mulliganed at least once to try and find one of my five pieces of one mana removal I boarded in. What would you do here?

After Thalia put me very far off tempo I died very quickly.

5 - 1

**Round 7 - Dickie playing RUG Peddler**

Flash is really good against clunky midrange decks with a limited number of threats like this one. This match up played out very similar to Naya in round four. I countered his large threats, used removal on his Peddler early Peddler/Static caster. I won this match up 2-0

Even though it has a poor RUG Flash match up, this Peddler deck seems like it could have a good match up against most of the field. Dickie finished in the top 16 with a record of 8-2.

6 - 1

**Round 8 - Bant Hexproof**

This match up can be a tough one for RUG due to how many different angles Bant Hexproof attacks from. Sometimes they come at you with Invisible Stalkers, other times Giest of St Traft, and other times still with Strangleroot Giest/Voice of Resurgence.

I kept a hand in game one that was a poor one to keep against Bant Hexproof and quickly died.

In game two I was able to deal with the first few threats he deployed, but ultimately it was his lack of blue mana that put the game away in my favor.

In game three I had all the right answers at all the right times. I killed a turn 2 Invisible Stalker with an Eletricky (on my turn this time!) and then was able to answer a turn three Giest of St Traft with a Clone after only taking a single hit from it.

7 - 1

**Round 9 - Jund Aggro**

This is a ""win and in round"". Meaning if I win this round, I could then draw into the top 8 in round ten. 

This is one of the many times during the event where I sorely missed having a full set of Searing Spears. I kept a hand in game one that wasn't terribly good against aggro and quickly died to a pair of Boars backed up by three bloodrush creatures.

In game two I once more died to an aggressive start with three toughness creatures backed up by bloodrush. Sadly, I was not making a top 8 today.

**Round 10 - Intentional Draw**

At SCG opens 9th-32nd place receive the exact same prize. Knowing top 8 was out of reach even with a win in this last round my opponent and I drew so we could both be in the top 32.

**Wrap Up**

I am still exploring the exact card selection I want in both the main and the side board for this list. I know for certain at any future event I want to be playing 3-4 Searing Spear again. Cutting down to only two of that spell was a mistake. Not sure on what my cuts will be for it yet – but they will be getting added back in.

In terms of side board – Izzet Staticaster was a turd all day. Cyclonic Rift on the other hand seemed to over perform every time I drew it. You will also note I've dropped the Curse of Echoes from the board. This is because UWx decks are **not** good in the metagame we are currently seeing right now. Because of this I did not want to devote board slots to this archetype – this could very well change for future events.

Have any questions/comments feel free to drop them below and I'll answer when I can. To all the other grinders out there I'm taking next weekend off, but I'll see you at the Chicago WMCQ and SCG St Louis the first two weekends in June!

1372226148.0,53,self.spikes,1h3bg8,[Modern] Scapeshift PSA: You can nullify 5 of the 6 Valakut triggers by destroying one of the mountains with the triggers on the stack.,70,17,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/1h3bg8/modern_scapeshift_psa_you_can_nullify_5_of_the_6/,"I just learned this recently and it proved to be extremely deadly for catching someone off guard. Also I'm not a judge so if any judges are reading this could you please verify. 

So the scenario is your opponent casts [Scapeshift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/pages/card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=146593) and sacrifices 7 lands and you have a [Tectonic Edge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/pages/card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=197855).

Your opponent searches up 4 steam vents, 1 stomping grounds, 1 basic mountain, and 1 [Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=valakut,+the+molten+pinnacle) (could be any combination of 6 mountains). The lands ETB simultaneously and 6 individual Valakut triggers from each mountain goes onto the stack. In response to the Valakut triggers on the stack, you Tectonic Edge the Stomping Ground.
&gt;Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle's triggered ability has an ""intervening 'if' clause."" That means (1) [snip], and (2) the ability will do nothing if you control fewer than five Mountains other than that new one by the time it resolves.

When the Valakut trigger caused by the Stomping Grounds resolves, even though the Stomping Ground is no longer on the battlefield (due to Tec Edge), it sees 5 other mountains on resolution and deals 3 damage (the triggered ability works regardless of the status of the card that triggered it).
But, when a Steam Vents caused Valakut trigger resolves. It sees 3 steam vents, and 1 basic mountain, and the trigger does NOTHING. Similarly the same occurs for the other 3 steam vents triggers and the basic mountain trigger.

So of the 6 triggers, only 1 deals damage and you've effectively prevented your untimely death by lava from Mount St. Helens.

Alternatively, you can just tec edge in response to the Scapeshift (before the sacrificing of lands), or do it before they cast Scapeshift to just slow them down a turn. But I saw this happen at FNM so just make sure you are aware because knowledge is power.",,False,,t5_2utkz,False,,,True,t3_1h3bg8,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/1h3bg8/modern_scapeshift_psa_you_can_nullify_5_of_the_6/,
1366708592.0,53,self.spikes,1cxcfz,[modern] Designing Combo Elves,67,14,80,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/1cxcfz/modern_designing_combo_elves/,"How do we build combo elves in modern? I've got an initial list that I like, and I'd like to discuss experiences testing and building the deck. 

Here's my initial take: 

* 4 Arbor Elf
* 4 Llanowar Elves
* 4 Nettle Sentinel
* 4 Heritage Druid
* 2 Deathrite Shaman
* 4 Elvish Visionary
* 4 Elvish Archdruid
* 4 Summoner's Pact Targets (see below) 
* 4 Summoner's Pact
* 4 Beck // Call 
* 4 Intruder Alarm
* 4 Misty Rainforest 
* 4 Verdant Catacombs
* 4 Forbidden Orchard
* 2 Dryad Arbor
* 2 Breeding Pool
* 1 Overgrown Tomb
* 1 Forest

There are two different versions you can run: Intruder Alarm based combo and Cloudstone Curio based combo. Both make your deck subtly different. I've been impressed with the power of Intruder Alarm and unimpressed with how difficult it is to go off with Curio, so I've been following the Intruder Alarm path. If you go with Curio, you don't get as much use out of the Dryad Arbors / Forbidden Orchards, though they're still good with Beck. 

I like Coiling Oracle, but it's actually hard to get blue mana when going off, so I don't think it's playable. 

**My configuration for the Pact slots currently is:**

* 1 Craterhoof Behemoth
* 1 Regal Force
* 1 Wren's Run Packmaster
* 1 Ezuri, Renegade Leader

**Comments on Pact choices:** 

* I think Craterhoof is a requirement. Emrakul would be okay if you could find it via Summoner's Pact. 
* Wren's Run Packmaster can be one of ten different cards- Imperious Perfect, Selesnya Guildmage, etc. can all work. You just want something that can go infinite with Intruder Alarm and with Elves that can be anything with {activated ability} : make a token. You want something that can be Summoner's Pacted for, so Sprout Swarm isn't an option, but I'd run it otherwise. Imperious Perfect is also an elf lord and would be my choice if I didn't have to wait a turn to go off with it. 
* Ezuri is wrath protection, and it's good when you have tons of mana. It's much better in Curio lists, and it could easily be replaced. 
* I haven't been tutoring for Regal Force much, but it's good in theory and has been very important in some games. 
* Other options for pact choices include Yeva to try to go off on their end step, Viridian Shaman to kill some artifacts, Fauna Shaman as another card that ""does something"", and Eternal Witness to recur things. 

**Other comments** 

* Consider Vengevine as either a sideboard or maindeck option. 
* I'd like a good way to give things haste, but I think it's impossible without a red splash. 
* Weird Harvest and Chord of Calling are both reasonable tutors, and either could be the right choice in some number for this deck. Chord of Calling, in particular has some nice synergy with Intruder Alarm. ",,False,,t5_2utkz,False,,,True,t3_1cxcfz,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/1cxcfz/modern_designing_combo_elves/,

1367186431.0,51,self.spikes,1daodr,"[Standard] UWR Control in Dragon's Maze Standard, and why it might Turn(//Burn) into the best deck in the format.",58,7,74,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/1daodr/standard_uwr_control_in_dragons_maze_standard_and/,"The GTC Standard UWR lists were notorious for being very powerful against aggro, but being weak to a resolved fatty (i.e. Junk Rites) and having a tough time against Esper Control. Fortunately for the deck, it looks like both of these weaknesses are being fixed with access to DGM cards, and the deck doesn't even have to sacrifice the anti-aggro strength to do it.

For reference, here is Wafo-Tapa's winning list from a PTQ last Saturday.

26 LANDS  
4 Hallowed Fountain  
4 Glacial Fortress  
4 Sulfur Falls  
4 Steam Vents  
4 Clifftop Retreat  
2 Island  
2 Sacred Foundry  
1 Desolate Lighthouse  
1 Moorland Haunt  

10 CREATURES  
3 Augur of Bolas  
3 Restoration Angel  
2 Snapcaster Mage  
2 Aurelia, the Warleader  

24 INSTANTS and SORCERIES  
4 Azorius Charm  
4 Searing Spear  
4 Sphinx's Revelation  
4 Think Twice  
3 Dissipate  
2 Supreme Verdict  
2 Rewind  
1 Syncopate  

The main benefits of Dragon's Maze are AEtherling and Turn//Burn. Aetherling gives the deck a damage-based closer that is much more powerful and resilient than Aurelia, Assemble the Legion, or a Reckoner combo. You can flicker it away from your own Wrath effects, it dodges as much removal as you have mana open, and it can close out a game in a couple of turns. If ever there was a deck for this card, this is it. It gives you a strong game against Esper control, which was severely lacking, as often Aurelia could be dealt with before she is able to close the game, and there's always inherent risk with Reckoners and a single instant-speed removal spell from your opponent. Obviously, I'm suggesting -2 Aurelia and +2 AEtherling.

I had high expectations for Turn//Burn at the prerelease, and it still outdid them. The card is nuts. Often, it's a 2-for-1 as a combat trick where you Turn the attacker that you're blocking, and Burn the one that dies to a Shock. If needed, it can 1-for-1 an Angel of Serenity (and they don't get their guys back) or a Thragtusk. It's also an instant-speed answer to Sire of Insanity, which I predict will be a real issue for the deck. A cool added utility of the card is that you can flashback Turn with Snapcaster and then just eat the attacker with your 2/1. Due to its versatility, I can't imagine running less than 3 in any list, but for now, I'm suggesting 4. Given AEtherling's ability to close a game (and that I'm pretty sure that 25 lands with 4 TT and 4 Sphinxes is enough), I'm suggesting -1 Moorland Haunt. For the other three slots, I'm trying -2 Rewind and -1 Searing Spear because I think that these overlap most in intended role, but I'm not sure if this is correct.

These considerations put me at this list: 

25 LANDS  
4 Hallowed Fountain  
4 Glacial Fortress  
4 Sulfur Falls  
4 Steam Vents  
4 Clifftop Retreat  
2 Island  
2 Sacred Foundry  
1 Desolate Lighthouse  

10 CREATURES  
3 Augur of Bolas  
3 Restoration Angel  
2 Snapcaster Mage  
2 AEtherling  

25 INSTANTS and SORCERIES  
4 Azorius Charm  
3 Searing Spear  
4 Sphinx's Revelation  
4 Think Twice  
3 Dissipate  
2 Supreme Verdict  
1 Syncopate  
4 Turn//Burn  

I haven't included a sideboard yet because I'm not sure how the metagame is going to develop, but I would anticipate some number of Izzet Staticaster and Pillar of Flames for Aristocrats and Naya Blitz, with the Pillars also being good against Voice of Resurgence if that gets played. In addition, I would anticipate some amount of sideboarded countermagic for the control matchup. Due to RIP's strength against both Aristocrats Act 2 and Reanimator, I would probably put a couple of those in as well.

Hopefully this serves as a good jumping-off point for discussion about the deck's development.

What we didn't want was to see 50 of these posts/day.  **With that, I (wingman) will be creating a weekly ""Critique My Deck!"" thread every Wednesday so that you can all post your deck ideas for the week's competitive events ahead.**  
  Please make use of this thread - I'm considering it a trial run right now.  If popular, I have no problem continuing it.  Please provide feedback to the mods, as well...I know we can come off as a little spikey in terms of moderation, but we really want this to be somewhere where the competitive spell-slinger in all of us can come to get better at Magic in a clean, streamlined environment.  
   
Feature number 2!  This feature is still in planning, but we *expect* (emphasis on expect) to begin **giving you all format-based primers and decks to beat on a weekly basis**.  For example, next week may be a modern primer, the week after standard, etc.  We will try to sculpt these primers to the format of the week...say, if we were to do a primer this week, it would almost certainly be Standard as there are at least 2 GPs featuring that format (Bochum and Charleston).  
  
We're looking for feedback on how you would like this presented.  Initially, we're thinking some sort of video primer/update on decks, but this could also be incorporated into a Spikes blog, or something of the sort (speaking of which...if you want a Blog, tell us - we'll make one for this subreddit, time permitting!).  
  
With that, we welcome discussion.  Tell us how you'd like the content presented, and we shall do our best to comply.  :)

I'm reading Next Level Magic, and he brought some good points up pretty early in. I know I definitely have an ego problem with some of my weaknesses as a magic player, so I figured I'd post here since I dont have a facebook, haha.

You're welcome to contribute yourselves, lets be humbled, and better for it.

Hmm..

I don't pay attention sometimes. I really don't. I think I know the best play and I end up screwing it up, That feeling of driving home after one mistake just screws up my record kills me, but I still jump into plays without thinking enough.

I get excited about bad cards. I can't tell the difference between cards that are really good and cards I really like sometimes. I have a hard time gauging power level come spoiler time, and sometimes rely on other people's opinions because of this fact.

I don't practice enough. I don't play enough magic to be as good as I want to be. I can't be bothered to proxy stuff up anymore.

E: wasn't expecting a response. Let's work on these guys. Now that they're out in the open we can honestly work to improve these parts of ourselves rather than sit in denial about them

Control Bias. I will ALWAYS play control. Even when I go to bigger tournaments (for me this is like a SCG open right now) I'll play what I want to. I hate turning creatures sideways a bunch of times, so much so that I really don't even consider cards/archetypes that are great

Every Wednesday is your chance to ask that question that's been bugging you without fear of downvotes, ridicule, etc...as long as it involves something relating to a spike (Yes, you can even ask what a Spike is...although I assume you know that at this point!).

The Moderators came to the conclusion that we needed a weekly thread to 1) benefit the group as a whole, and 2) reduce the number of similar posts we see on a daily basis that can be rectified with a weekly thread. Much like the deckbuilding posts of old, we'll put a sticky on the sidebar for easy access.

Here are a set of general courtesies when posting here, paraphrased from /u/bokchoykn in /r/magictcg):

- Ask thought-provoking questions.

- Tell us very specifically about what you want.

- Be open to any suggestions.

- Remember that, in the end, this isn't /r/magictcg. Please gear your questions towards a competitive, play-to-win audience. After all, that's what we're all about!

With that...ask us anything!

It's been a (somewhat) big player in Legacy in various decks, so it certainly has the power pedigree for Modern. It will see play, the question is how much.

It matches up VERY well against Melira Pod, handily stopping any Persist creatures, blanks Snapcaster Mage; Fights Tarmogoyf and Deathrite Shaman, and also hoses any Gifts Ungiven into Unburial Rites shenanigans. The lifegain ability is also huge against Mono-red/RB Burn. I'm sure there are plenty of other interactions, those are off the top of my head.


So, will it go into current decks? Create new ones where it's a 4-of?

1365540418.0,42,self.spikes,1c0j8e,[Legacy] Third at SCG Atlanta - Report,54,12,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/1c0j8e/legacy_third_at_scg_atlanta_report/,"Howdy All,

I’m back with another legacy event report – this time from the SCG Open in Atlanta. After having a stellar 7-1 day one at the invitational, into an awful 1-6 day two, I shook off a slight illness and lack of sleep in order to 7 – 0 – 2 my way into the top 8 of the Legacy Open where I finished third out of 300+ people. I was loaming again and you can find the 75 I played to success listed [here]( http://sales.starcitygames.com//deckdatabase/displaydeck.php?DeckID=54838). 

The [write up](http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/1a33db/legacy_third_at_scg_indy_report/) from my third place finish at SCG Indy was well received here and I’ve had a few requests from folks to do another write up – so here one is. 

**Round 1 – Chris VanMeter with UWBg Blade**

Sometimes round one at these things can be a bye – this was not one of those times. Chris is an established player, occasional writer for SCG and finished in the top 32 at the invitational. He is playing an Esper Blade deck splashing Deathrite Shaman that is very similar to the list BBD played in the top 8 of the invitational. 

Sylvan Library was a last minute addition to my list before the legacy open (I hadn’t ever played it in loam previously). Library was worth its weight in gold this matchup. Over the course of the two games we played I easily drew at least six extra cards off of it (at one point I had a giant Knight get plowed giving me a ton of room to draw cards that game). 

In both games one and two I resolved very timely devastating dreams to lock him out of the game by wrathing his board and destroying all of his lands.

1 – 0

**Round 2 – Lands**

This is honestly a matchup I’d never played before – I’m still not sure if it is favorable or not. I was honestly just pleased we finished three games without going to time. In game one I resolved a Knight which quickly got stalemated by a few Maze of Ith on the other side of the table. Using the Knight to thin as many cards as possible out of my deck I was eventually able to draw a Devastating Dreams and cast it for seven – killing every land on his side of the table – a turn later he died to my massive Knight.

In game two I got locked out of the game fairly hard by his Wastelands (powered out by Exploration) and Engineered Explosives killing my Mox Diamonds. I know when I’m beat and scooped up my cards even though he wasn’t going to actually kill me for another 20~ minutes. Know when you need to beat the clock people!

Game three he died to a very large Knight yet again. The series of plays that got me there was the following though:
“Float green from my forest and float black from my Bojuka Bog. Knight my Forst into a Wasteland. Wasteland my Bojuka Bog. Loam back my Forst, Bog and Wasteland. Bojuka Bog you.” *Repeat*

Bogging the graveyard engine deck every other turn is a heck of a plan.

2 – 0

**Round 3 – UWBg Blade with Lingering Souls/Sorin**

Another take on Esper Blade this round – this time with a token based back up plan. In game one he leads by fetching up some non-basic lands (mistake!). I punish him by wastelanding him a bunch – but not before he floods a bunch of Lingering Souls tokens onto the table. A few turns later a Devastating Dreams and Knight a mop up his tokens and close out the game.

In game two I can tell he is fairly pleased with the seven cards he gets to keep. That is fine, I have my favorite turn one play in my opening hand. He plays a fetch land and passes. I draw my card for the turn and go: Land -&gt; Mox Diamond -&gt; Chalice of the Void on one. His Stoneforge Mystic doesn’t beat my Abrupt Decay and Dark Confidant. After the game he shows me the hand he kept that had Surgical Extraction, Swords to Plowshares and another one drop in it.

Chalice of the Void is a heck of a magic card.

3 – 0

**Round 4 – Jund**

Jund can be a rough matchup for this Loam list. If a Deathrite sits on the table your engine is basically turned off. Thankfully Punishing Fire, Abrupt Decay, Devastating Dreams and Burning Wish can all kill this sucker dead. I lose a very close game one and then dominate game two when my turn one Dark Confidant on the play goes unanswered for many turns. 

Game three literally came down to a single top deck. He has bolted me down to two life with a Deathrite on the table, but I have wasted him off of all his black mana sources. He untapped, failed to draw the black source he needs to close the game and then concedes as my Knight is lethal the following turn. Sometimes you are better off being lucky than good!

As an aside I was his only loss in the swiss – he made top 8 with me (Zach Tyree).

4 – 0

**Round 5 – Josh Glantzman with RUG Delver**

Josh is a friend of mine and I know this is his first weekend playing RUG Delver. I also know he made top 16 at the invitational missing his *win and in* round 16 VS Gerry T. His record with RUG delver for the weekend thus far you ask? A casual 12-0 of course. He also knows I really like Loam’s RUG Delver match up though.

This was the first dice roll I lost today, but Josh mulliganed to five on the play game one. Twenty turns into the game Josh has an empty board to my six land and a Sylvan Library. He opts to go to the next game instead of waiting twenty more turns for my Dryad Arbor to beat him down.

Game two Josh has what I can only describe as the “nut” hand out of RUG delver. Turn one delver, natural flip turn two, into a turn three Mongoose backed up by two wastelands and a daze. I pack it in as the Goose hits threshold and we head into game three.

In game three I finally get to be on the play. I don’t remember all the details from this one aside from the fact that he countered the first five times I cast loam leaving me stuck on just a Tiaga and a Mox Diamond for a very long time. Thankfully his turn two delver didn’t flip right away and eventually he ran out of counter magic. Once my first loam resolved the game ran away from him very quickly.

5 – 0

**Round 6 – Bant Maverick**

Piece of advice folks – pile shuffle your deck and pack it away from both you *and* your opponent. This person was nice enough to show me a Mother of Runes and Tropical Island before the match even started. As far as I could tell his blue splash was purely for Giest.

In game one I was looking very, very dead when my Sylvan Library found me a Burning Wish, which snagged me a Perish to mop up the two Knights and a Savaging Ooze on his side of the table. A Devastating Dreams and a Knight of my own later we moved onto game two.

In game two the board came to a stale mate for a few turns until I could draw into a Devastating Dreams to mop things up. Thankfully he didn’t have a Knight of his own this time – so I was able to wrath his entire board while leaving behind a 17/17 Knight for myself.

6 – 0

**Round 7 – Max Tietze with Goblins**

There are only four undefeated players remaining – but it is still too early to ID. Max is the opponent I was hoping for this round – even though he is crazy good at playing Goblins I still have yet to lose to Goblins in a sanctioned event while playing Loam. He wins the die roll and has a hyper aggressive start that leaves me at one life on turn three. I have a Tiaga and a Devestating Dreams in my hand, but alas I cannot crack the fetch I have on the table without falling to zero – so onto game two we went (as a side note if I would have played out my lands differently I could have survived this onslaught! A miss play for sure). 

I haven’t mentioned it yet in this write up, but in case you are unaware this Loam deck mulligans a lot. Both my seven and my six in game two are unable to cast any of the spells they contain without drawing into the perfect type of land. I go to five while Max keeps what I read to be a slightly sketchy six. My five card hand is the best I can ask for in this matchup: Dryad Arbor, Badlands, Mox Diamond, Dark Confidant, Knight. Max’s eyes get wide as I play a turn one Dark Confidant and pass. My read on him keeping a sketchy hand is dead on. His turn one is a port into a relic and he then has to cycle the relic on turn two in order to make his second land drop. A Knight and a Devastating Dreams later I close out game two.

Game three is really close and there is no doubt in my mind that I would not have won it if I hadn’t had a Sylvan Library active (if you aren’t familiar with how Sylvan Library and dredge interact together you should find a smart judge and ask them). Three Abrupt Decays to kill a Relic and two Vials later I stick a Knight and close things out once again with a Devastating Dreams.

7 – 0

**Rounds 8/9**

I am able to ID these last two rounds to make it into top 8. Sadly, the person I drew with in the final round drew themselves out of top 8 (and he was the one to offer me the draw!). So lesson to be learned folks – learn how to do tie breaker math.

**Quarter Finals – TES (The Perfect Storm)** 

TES hasn’t been getting nearly as much attention as ANT lately, I won’t get into which is better or why – simply know that TES in general is a full turn faster than ANT. Thankfully I am the fourth seat going into the top 8 so I get to be on the play for this round. Ruben covered this round with written coverage which you can find [here]( http://www.starcitygames.com/events/coverage/1824_quarterfinals_jeff_hoogland_vs.html).

**Semi Finals – Jund**

I could just be your typical magic player about this round and claim that my opponent drew “the nuts” while I failed to draw anything relevant. While I feel like his draws might have been above average, with mine being sub-par there is no doubt in my mind that I could have played this round a bit differently at several points. Most notably being the Burning Wish I cast for a Thoughtseize in game two. It 100% percent should have gotten a Life from the Loam instead. My line of thinking at the time was that I couldn’t possible brick on my Library for almost a dozen turns right? 

*Wrong*. 

I did end up bricking on my Library draws for far longer than I should have, but you know what? That wouldn’t have matter at *all* if I would have made the optimal play of wishing for a Loam instead of that Thoughtseize. 

But hey – this was my 25th round of magic in 48 hours. To say I was getting a bit burned out at that point was an understatement. 

**Wrap Up**

Once more I finished the event 8 – 1 – 2 in matches (not bad). I still love playing this arch type and there is a very high chance I will be playing it at SCG Milwaukee this coming weekend. Sylvan Library was a flipping all star in my deck for most of the day and I am still not sure why I hadn’t tried it sooner.

Thanks for reading this wall of text and as always if you have any questions/comments feel free to drop them below.

Cheers,

~Jeff Hoogland

My inner Timmy roared when Kalonian Hydra was spoiled. I'm on my phone and can't link, so: 

3GG, creature - hydra, 0/0, trample, etb w/ 4 +1/+1 counters, when ~ attacks, double the num of +1/+1 counters on each creature you control.

Since I mostly play limited, I initially only evaluated it in a limited vacuum. I just thought of it as another derpy green bomb creature. Then, I realized this card had potential outside of limited, and I realized this by playing limited. The RTR block oozes mechanics that beg to be abused by Kalonian Hydra. Unleash, evolve and scavenge each add +1/+1 counters to creatures. Additionally, for 3 months, we have access to cards with Undying, such as Strangleroot Geist and Young Wolf.

The biggest concern everyone has with Hydra is that it has no board impact when you cast it. You need to untap with it in order for it to be relevant. With the return of doom blade to standard, this becomes more of an issue. To circumvent this weakness, all of the 4 drops in the deck give creatures haste. Exava basically gives your entire deck haste (along with a 3/3 or 4/4 first strike creature that's hard to deal with in combat), and Ogre Battledriver makes your topdecks much more powerful.

I'd love to hear your feedback/opinions/suggestions/criticisms. I've done no playtesting with this deck, but I'm around all day if anyone wishes to playtest on cockatrice. I'm playtesting NOW as ""sim sim sala bim"". [Here](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/10986944/cards.zip/) is the latest .xml for m14!


Current List:

Hydra Jund

**Land (23):**

* 4 Overgrown Tomb
* 4 Stomping Ground
* 2 Kessig Wolf Run
* 4 Woodland Cemetery
* 4 Rootbound Crag
* 2 Dragonskull Summit
* 2 Blood Crypt
* 1 Forest

**Creatures (26):**

* 3 Exava, Rakdos Blood Witch
* 4 Kalonian Hydra
* 3 Ogre Battledriver
* 3 Thundermaw Hellkite
* 2 Varolz, the Scar-Striped
* 4 Elvish Mystic
* 3 Arbor Elf
* 4 Gyre Sage
* 1 Ruric Thar, the Unbowed

**Spells (11):**

* 4 Farseek
* 3 Domri Rade
* 2 Garruk, Caller of Beasts
* 1 Doom Blade
* 1 Dreadbore

**Sideboard (15):**

* 1 Bonfire of the Damned
* 2 Devour Flesh
* 3 Rakdos's Return
* 1 Dreadbore
* 1 Doom Blade
* 1 Ruric Thar, the Unbowed
* 4 Scavenging Ooze
* 2 Acidic Slime

**Sideboarding for matchups:**

Rakdos's return destroys control

Ruric Thar destroys control/enchantments

Bonfire beats other dork decks and helps against aggro

Dreadbore is for esper control decks/Reckoner

Doom Blade is for reckoner

Devour Flesh is for hexproof

Ooze is for graveyard hate and comes in fully to replace Gyre Sage

Acidic Slime is a cool cat

**Other considerations and notes:**

* Card advantage is limited
* ~~Not great vs Aristocrats~~ Post-changes, deck is better handled to deal w/ reckoner
* ~~Boros Reckoner stonewalls the deck, Doom Blade is the only good answer to it in the deck~~ ^
* Gyre sage underperformed the first time around, but I am reconsidering it because Ooze doesn't really do shit. Too much removal in sideboard, so ooze could take the place of some of the removal
* Best curve: t1 dork, t2 domri, t3 exava, t4 hydra
* Rakdos's return shreds control decks
* New garruk is awesome for the same reasons domri is - hard to kill, provides consistent card advantage
* No answer to Predator Ooze aside from Slaughter Games - considering Tragic Slip as sideboard removal
* Deck lacks a way to gain life aside from Scavenging Ooze
* Okay, I have to say it again, new Garruk owns. Up to 2 mainboard now.

**Playtesting records:**

(These are matches, not games played)

* OVERALL RECORD: 10-5

* 2-0 vs Bant Pants
* 2-1 vs Aristocrats

1369100975.0,42,self.spikes,1eqipx,[Legacy] 19th at SCG Nashville - Report,50,8,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/1eqipx/legacy_19th_at_scg_nashville_report/,"Because of the character limit on self posts I had to split this report into two of them. You can read about my SCG Nashville standard finish [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/1eqinj/standard_21st_at_scg_nashville_report/).

**Legacy -**

In legacy I'm still rocking the four color Loam list that has been serving me well for the last few months. You can find a full primer on the deck [here](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/26118_Loam-Is-Where-The-Heart-Is.html).

**Round 1 - Goblins**

I won the die roll in game one and kept a bit of a risky hand:

* 2 Mox Diamond
* Knight of the Reliquary
* 3 Land
* Wasteland

This is a fairly all-in hand that odds are would either win or lose almost on the spot. Against Goblins this hand was pretty amazing though. Turn one Knight, into a turn two Wasteland and I quickly put the game away. 

Game two ended when I cast the first Devastating Dreams.

1 - 0

**Round 2 - Alex with Esper Stoneblade**

Alex had finished second in the standard open that morning (congrats!). I won the die roll and then we both mulliganed to six before starting our game. My six was stellar. Turn one Chalice of the Void followed up by a turn two Dark Confidant prompted a scooped from my opponent on the third turn once he saw Knight get flipped to my Bob.

This was one of those games where knowing the legacy format inside and out has its advantages. After seeing only an Island and an Academy Ruins from my opponent I was able to correctly assume he was playing Esper-blade. Our second game was fairly unexciting.

2 - 0

**Round 3 - Elves**

Another person who sat down across from me knowing what deck I was playing. Thankfully he was playing Elves - a fairly good match up for Loam.

I won the die roll and kept a hand that had a curve of cycle land, into Chalice of the Void. A few Punishing Fires later all of his green men had died and soon there after a Nantuko Monastery closed the game out.

On the draw in game two he led with a Deathrite Shaman on one, but I had a turn one Chalice. His turn two continued to lay on the hate with a Savaging Ooze, but a Devastating Dreams for two quickly put the game out of reach.

3 - 0

**Round 4 - UR Delver**

As always Chalice of the Void was punching the clock and going to work today. I won the die roll and had a turn one Chalice on the play. The only spells he played this game were a Snapcaster Mage and a Force of Will. 

Game two I had another turn one Chalice (lot of those today). Nothing else very interesting in this game.

4 - 0

**Round 5 - Lands**

This was a camera match you can find in the SCG Archives.

My opponent in this round was flustered during our third game as the clock was running short and dredged his Loam, but then still drew his card for the turn - he was awarded a game loss for this. I'm fairly certain I would have won this game had there been infinite time on the clock - but odds are we would have drawn had it not been for his mistake.

5 - 0

**Round 6 - Adam Prosak with ANT**

Prosak and I both knew what the other was playing. We've played this match up before and both know what to expect going in. He won the die roll and we then proceeded to have a fairly awkward game one. Because he was on the play, I kept a Chaliceless seven and was rewarded for doing so when he led with a turn one Cabal Therapy naming Chalice of the Void. I was feeling good about my position in the game when I had a Sylvan Library on two followed up by a Devastating Dreams on three (for three). 

The game progressed and Adam cast an Ad Nausem which took him all the way down to three life while I had a Dark Confidant on the table. I untapped, triggered my Bob, triggered my Library and missed in four cards to hit a Chalice, a Wasteland, a Burning Wish or a Punishing Fire to close the game out.

Moving on to game two I had a double Chalice hand with two lands to start. I lead with a land and a Chalice on zero and passed the turn. Unfortunately for me, Adam's turn one had disruption this time around in the form of Duress - so he was able to rip what would have been a Chalice for one out of my hand. A well placed Abrupt Decay later I was stormed out of the round.

5 - 1

**Round 7 - Joe with Natural Order Bant**

After losing my first win and in last round to Prosak I am pumped to have a second chance at top 8. I know what Joe is playing as I have been watching the other players at the top tables for the last few rounds. I'm pretty excited to have this as my match up - four main deck Perish are pretty good against the Natural Order deck.

Sadly, it turns out this was the round my deck was going to vomit on me. After keeping an opening hand with three land, my opponent spent his first two turns Wastelanding me. Normally, my 26 land deck doesn't mind this line of play - but as I started my third turn I still had not drawn another land. No worries - I played my Savannah and cast Green Sun's Zenith to find my Dryad Arbor. On his turn he plowed my Dryad Arbor and I then failed to make a second land drop for the remainder of the game. 

Trying my best not to tilt I shuffle up for game two and draw my starting hand:

* 3 Land
* Mox Diamond
* Sylvan Library
* 2 Other Cards

Sweet! Turn one Library - I can't possibly stumble on lands this game, right? Wrong. Around 8 turns later I had yet to find a fourth mana source. By the time I found my fourth mana source I had let the tilt set in and I made a block with my Knight of the Reliquary that cost me the game and my chance at top 8.

I signed the match slip and wished Joe good luck in the top 8.

**Round 8 - Intentional Draw/UW Rest in Peace**

Once again I offered the draw to my opponent so we could both make top 32. He accepted, but asked to play a couple of games anyways for the practice. I enjoy playing magic so I agreed.

Game one I had a strong start with a Chalice of the Void on turn one into a Knight of the Reliquary on two. An Abrupt Decay on a Rest in Peace and a few turns later I beat down my opponent with my Knight.

Game two I assembled my favorite ""soft lock"" of Chalice on one + Gaddock Teeg. Ten turns later my bear had beaten him into submission. 

**Wrap Up**

I don't really have much to say about my legacy list that wasn't already said in the [primer](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/26118_Loam-Is-Where-The-Heart-Is.html). If you want to hear about some legacy from a slightly different perspective [u/DarkM27](http://www.reddit.com/user/Darkm27) should be posting an event report from his top 16 finish from Nashville this weekend ~~in the next few days~~ [his report](http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/1eqr81/legacy_15th_at_scg_nashville_with_bug_stuff_report/).

Have any questions/comments feel free to drop them below and I'll answer when I can. To all the other grinders out there I'm taking next weekend off, but I'll see you at the Chicago WMCQ and SCG St Louis the first two weekends in June!

1366132730.0,46,self.spikes,1ch0dz,"[Mod Announcement] Some announcements, and a reminder about the rules of the subreddit",56,10,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/1ch0dz/mod_announcement_some_announcements_and_a/,"Hey everyone,

First, some good news: /r/spikes is more popular than ever! Give yourselves a pat on the back. In particular, [Winning Wednesday](http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/1c2f67/winning_wednesday_week_of_april_10_ask_rspikes/) was a huge success -- thanks to everyone who asked questions and contributed answers. In fact, last Wednesday broke our record for unique visitors and pageviews (3,500 uniques and 11,500 pageviews), and also managed to bring 50 new subscribers to the subreddit.

Given this influx of new members, the other mods and I thought this was an opportune time to remind everyone about the rules of this sub. While they're also outlined on the handy-dandy sidebar, here's some of the highlights:

* **Don't be a jerk.** Personal attacks or disparaging comments will not be tolerated. This includes anything along the lines of ""you clearly don't understand how to play Magic."" That said, respectful disagreement and debate are welcome, as long as it's civil and constructive.

* **Keep downvotes to a minimum.** Don't downvote someone because you think their opinion is ""wrong"" (about a deck, a card, or whatever). Instead, reply and explain why you disagree.

* **Please report problematic threads or posts** using the button on every thread/post. This is the easiest way of bringing issues to the mods' attention.

* **We're only interested in discussing competitive Magic.** In general, this means archetypes that see (or once saw) success at major tournaments. Lists that 4-0 MTGO Dailies are probably the bottom level

* **Don't just post a decklist and expect us to critique it.** If you want to talk about an unproven deck, you should explain in detail why you think it's competitive. (As an example of a good post about an unproven deck, [Jeff Hoogland posted a month ago about his attempts to revive the RUG deck that some people attempted at Pro Tour Gatecrash](http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/1a63x1/standard_can_rug_flash_be_a_deck/).)
Posts that don't meet are subject to being removed.

* **Please remember to tag your posts.** For instance, throw [Standard] in the front of the subject line of your post about your Jund decklist so we know you're not talking about Modern. Posts without tags are liable to be removed (or rejected by our modbot).

Finally, with that out of the way, we have some really cool stuff coming down the pipeline, including another installment of Winning Wednesday and [the upcoming AMA with Jeff Hoogland](http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/1cgk7u/jeff_hoogland_coming_off_of_double_top_4/)!

If you have any suggestions (or constructive criticisms!) for the subreddit, please feel free to leave 'em in the comments. [Or shoot us a private message.](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fspikes)

Thanks for being awesome, and keep winning!

So 6 days ago, there was a thread about the declining quality of posts on r/spikes. We as moderators told you we'd do something about it, and we have. I personally have deleted close to 20 topics, and have messaged each person with a constructive way to increase the actual content in their posts. Many of the same points have been repeated, so I wanted to share a few of them with you.

- Be as informative as possible

This point is the biggest. The more you can tell us about your topic, the more likely it is we'll have something to say. Having no substance in your question or topic is an easy way to have it deleted. **The easiest way to avoid poor questions is to avoid asking questions that can be answered with a yes or no.**

- Don't speculate without testing

If you have an idea for a deck, or want to know how a certain card will do against other cards/decks, test it first! If you find that it's terrible, then it wasn't worth asking and you've gained experience. If it is good or if you've had mixed results, that's a great time to make a topic.

- Nobody wants to talk about YOUR deck

If I asked anybody here if they cared about what deck I was playing, or even at my local store, it would be a resounding NO. When you make a post asking what you should play, what you should include in your deck, if your deck is any good, nobody wants to see it because they are busy with their own decks.

Instead, I suggest posting about archetypes, winning lists, and other more broadly interesting topics. If the post is about Magic and not about you, people are far more willing to listen.

Those are some preliminary ways to improve this sub's quality overall.

We have also decided that the Critique Your Deck thread is more often a place where we put things we don't want to see on the front page. Since we're moving toward discussions on archetypes and less about specific lists, the thread will instead be replaced with a semi-frequent [SCD] thread, to help gather the collective assessments of r/spikes as a whole.

Also, as a favor, we moderators ask the community to report posts that break the spirit of r/spikes in order to help us keep it clean. We'd also like to hear your feedback on how we've been doing the past few days with our low-tolerance approach.

Thanks all!

In the most recent SCG Atlanta, the top 5 decks did not even have it in the sideboard. But the one deck that does capture my attention is [this](http://sales.starcitygames.com//deckdatabase/displaydeck.php?DeckID=52793) 8th place deck. Having haste stopped cold and then seeing Geist of St. Traft on turn 3, tokens, or charms is very crippling. And so far I haven't seen it much, but I have played against it and it's crippling against fast aggro like RDW and RW Aggro.

So my question to my fellow aggro spikes is this: Do you think that the power of this card against haste will be important enough to force opponents use it against you? If so, do you think it's worth considering a direct answer like [War-Priest of Thune](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=275698), [Oblivion Ring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=259711), or even something in a third color like [Burst of Strength](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=366304)? If not, how would you get creative around it?

Thank you in advances, spikes!

1366746144.0,40,self.spikes,1cyg2a,[WMCQ DC] 12th Place with Naya Midrange,48,8,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/1cyg2a/wmcq_dc_12th_place_with_naya_midrange/,"A few friends and I were planning to make the trip down to DC from NYC for the WMCQ, PTQ (sunday) and various SCG side events for quite some time.  We decided to go down on Friday so we could settle into our hotel, grab dinner and do some last minute testing and sideboard critiquing.  This proved invaluable in the long run as it allowed us to be more rested and prepared than a number of players who drove in that morning.



Deck List found here: 

[http://sales.starcitygames.com//deckdatabase/displaydeck.php?DeckID=55189](http://sales.starcitygames.com//deckdatabase/displaydeck.php?DeckID=55189)



During the player meeting we were told that we had 372 players and would be slogging it out for 9 rounds.  At this point I was quite happy to have had a decent nights sleep and a good breakfast from a local cafe.



**Round 1: UWR Midrange**


Game 1: My opponent stumbled on mana, causing their first sweeper (Blasphemous Act) and first Sphinx’s Revelation to come a bit late to the party.  After they wiped out my initial threats, I began throwing Thundermaw’s at them until they died.


Sideboard:  I took out the Bonfires and the Selesnya Charms in favor of Garruk, Oblivion Rings, Assemble the Legion, Sigarda and a single Rest in Peace for the mise (I saw multiple Think Twices as well as Harvest Pyre).


Game 2: My opponent again has some mana and land drop issues.  I had a Boros Reckoner and Loxodon Smiter that kept attacking into Azorious Charm (I believe they used all 4 over the course of the game).  At some point I got down Assemble the Legion and the clock quickly became overwhelming.


**2-1 (1-0)**



**Round 2: Junk Rites**


Game 1: I Bonfired away multiple mana dorks and spirit tokens early and got to work with Thundermaw.  They were able to cast one Angel of Serenity, but an end of turn Selesnya Charm into double Thundermaw the following turn sealed the victory.


Sideboard:  I sideboarded out some number of Smiters (they seem to be lower impact when the opponent has Slimes), Huntmasters and some Thragtusks for Rest in Peace, Garruk and Blasphemous Act.


Game 2:  I believe in this game he got a very quick Angel of Serenity and there was no Miracle Bonfire, Selesnya Charm or Blasphemous Act to be found.  I scooped and moved on to the next game a bit frustrated with my lack of answers.  I suppose that Junk Rites sometimes just crushes you under the weight of their graveyard synergy.  


Game 3:  In similar fashion to Game 1, I managed an early Bonfire for his mana dorks and he stumbled on colors (G/W duals and colorless lands) for several turns.  I believe I was able to smash with Thundermaw and follow it up with Reckoner + Blasphemous Act when he finally resolved a Thragtusk.


**2-1 (2-0)**



**Round 3: Junk Rites**


Game 1 and 2:  This was a very quick match where I was able to cast and/or miracle multiple Bonfires per game and had a Selesnya Charm for any Thragtusk blinking shenanigans he tried to use to stabilize.  I felt my opponent had some bad luck and never really was in the match.  He got his vengeance on Sunday when he beat me in a close 3 game match in the PTQ.  I sideboarded the same way as the previous round.


**2-0 (3-0)**



**Round 4: Bant Control (w/ Drownyard)**


Game 1:  My opponent’s deck looked like it was a bit behind the current trends in a number of ways:  he was using Drownyard instead of Wolf Run and had multiple main deck Terminii.  The first game involved me playing my Thundermaws and pseudo-haste EOT Restoration Angels very carefully.  He miracled quite a few Terminii but I was able to grind out the win.


Sideboard: I took out my Avacyn’s Pilgrims and shaved a few other cards here and there in favor of Assemble, Oblivion Ring, Sigarda and Garruk.


Game 2:  This was a very back and forth game where he was trying to keep a Jace, Memory Adept in play.  In the end I was able to deal with the first one, but the second landed and I needed at least one more turn to finish off his life.  He was able to resolve two Sphinx’s Revelations for 4+ which definitely helped him dig up enough cards to keep the Jace plan going.  I think he managed to miracle at least 2 Terminus this game as well, but luckily I was able to recoup card advantage by drawing 5 cards with each of my Garruks to make the fight a bit closer.


Game 3:  In this game I was able to ramp out a very early Assemble the Legion and he never really found an answer.  Eventually I stopped deploying creature based threats from my hand and just slammed the soldiers into his side of the board turn after turn until victory.


**2-1 (4-0)**



**Round 5: Wolf Run Bant**


My opponent this round was very nice and very excited to be undefeated.  It seemed like he was the only one out of his friends that was able to slip in at the end of registration while they were finding parking.  Unfortunately, he also some amount of travel lag weighing down on his plays for the whole match.


Game 1: I was applying quite a bit of pressure and he had the option to use an Azorious Charm on a Thundermaw but we were playing the standard game of “Wolf Run Chicken”:


Me: “Attack with Smiter, Reckoner and Thundermaw”
Him: “No blocks”
Me: “Pass priority, damage?”
Him: &lt;long pause&gt; “Ok.”
Me: “Take 12, you are at 0”
Him: “Oh wow... that was pretty bad.”


Basically I had enough mana to Wolf Run for 3 or 4, so he could have proactively charmed my Thundermaw and taken less than lethal damage.  Instead he got onto a bit of anti-Wolf Run auto pilot and was scooping up while shaking his head.


Sideboard: Same as the prior Bant opponent.


Game 2:  In this game my deck stumbled a bit and he was able to resolve multiple large Sphinx’s Revelations.  I don’t think I drew any of my haymakers and it was over fairly quick.


Game 3:  This game went similar to the first one.  I had lots of early pressure and was able to follow up his Supreme Verdict with a string of deadly Thundermaws.  When it looked like he might stabilize on the back of a few Azorious Charms, I dropped both an Assemble the Legion and a Garruk for the tag team of difficult-to-deal-with-non-creature-permanents.  A few grindy turns later and I moved on to 5-0.  My opponent advised me to keep winning, and I responded simply with “That’s the plan.”


**2-1 (5-0)**



**Round 6: Naya Blitz**


Game 1:  This game my opponent did the classic Naya Blitz curve of Champion into BTE + Mauler into Frontline Medic.  I ended up not being able to deal with the Medic and could not mount an offense while still keeping up enough defense.


Sideboard: I took out my Thundermaws and Selesnya Charms for Oblivion Ring, Searing Spear and Blasphemous Act.


Game 2:  We shuffled up and right as we attempted to present we were hit with the dreaded mid round deck check.  This almost tilted me a bit as I had just gotten demolished in Game 1 and was anxious to see my opening 7 with the post board configuration.  Fortunately everything came back fine and we shuffled up once again.  My opponent mulliganed to 6 and keep what he later described as a “Risky but high potential” hand.  Unfortunately, he got stuck on one dual land and multiple caverns and was unable to cast a lot of his spells on time.  When you face Naya Midrange and play at their pace (one spell per turn generally) with an aggressive deck, you will quickly be buried in a pile of card quality.  After a few turns I was at or above 20 life and he was scooping up for the next game.  


Game 3:  This game my opponent kept another risky hand but it worked out a little better for him.  Unfortunately for him, I was able to hard cast a Bonfire for 2 and then 3 the very next turn to wipe his board out twice.  He was able to follow up each one with a BTE + Mauler, but I was soon casting and blinking my Thragtusk over and over.  Once it got to the point where I was saying “Why can’t I hold all these Beast Tokens?!” he packed up his cards.


**2-1 (6-0)**



**Round 7: GR Aggro**


Game 1:  My opponent had an awkward, slow start and I was able to settle into the Thragtusk blinking game before finishing up with a Thundermaw.  His only reasonable attempt to make headway was a Hellrider + bloodrushed Ghor-Clan Rampager, but I had the Selesnya Charm to punish him.


Sideboard: I boarded out Thundermaws and some Bonfires (they seem impossible to make work as most of his stuff ends up having 3+ toughness and I haven’t quite had much miracle luck all day) in favor of Oblivion Ring, Searing Spear and Blasphemous Act.


Game 2: My opponent came out of the gates swinging and my mulligan to 6 was sadly a turn or so two slow to compete with the sheer power of his curve.  I shrugged it off and moved to the next game.


Game 3:  This was a very close game where we got into a racing situation.  I was getting a bit land flooded but was taking advantage of it with Wolf Run.  I needed a Selesnya Charm to stay in the game, as there were several attacks my opponent made that smelled of Ghor-Clan Rampaging.  I had already played 2 to take care of a Wolfir Silverheart and a Thundermaw, but the final one was buried in my deck somewhere and I ended up being one turn too slow on the race.


**1-2 (6-1)**



**Round 8: Junk Rites**


Game 1:  My opponent had a sketchy start and I had a string of Bonfires and Selesnya charms to deal with his mana dorks and large monsters.  He seemed a bit frustrated and quickly moved to sideboard.


Sideboard: My plan remained the same as it was in earlier rounds vs Junk Rites.


Game 2: My opponent paid me back a bit this time as my deck stumbled and was crushed by a string of Acidic Slime triggers.  Sometimes you just can’t keep the appropriate lands on the board if they draw enough of their LD package.


Game 3: This was a close game for a while where I was applying a lot of pressure but he kept bouncing back with Angel of Serenity and Thragtusk.  Eventually he was able to reanimate a second Angel of Serenity (I never drew RIP), leaving me with a Boros Reckoner against his double Angel and a tokens.  


My opponent was able to crack me for 10 in the air and put me into a dead-on-board situation.  Fortunately, it seemed that the MTG gods deemed it time I see a miracle and on my final turn to live I was able to Bonfire for more than his life total.  He was very angry and frustrated at this turn of events and signed the slip with a pen full of venom and malice.


**2-1 (7-1)**



**Round 9: Aristocrats Act 2**


This round was my win and in feature match against Ben Friedman.  I was a bit intimidated going into this match, but from overhearing him converse with Reid Duke earlier I knew that he was a bit new to the Aristocrats Act 2 archetype. 


Game 1:  He had a slow start this game and I was able to settle into a Thragtusk blinking plan without a spot removal spell in sight to slip me up.  I believe I was able to Selesnya Charm a Falkenrath Aristocrat that picked up a +1/+1 counter from a Doomed Traveler to seal the deal.


Sideboard:  I was still a bit unsure how to sideboard for this match, especially considering that they no longer rely as heavily on morbid triggers due to cutting Skirsdag High Priest from the list.  Against previous iterations, Rest in Peace could often shut off their entire game plan if they went too far down the morbid road.  I settled on removing some Thundermaws and Smiters (which I felt would fall victim to his sideboarded Mark of Mutinys) for Oblivion Ring, Searing Spear and 2 Rest in Peace.  I kept the Selesnya Charms for the possibility of mising Falkenrath Aristocrats, Thundermaws and Obzedats.  


Game 2:  I was able to Thragtusk a number of times, but he kept punching me with an Aristocrat.  Eventually my life total was too low and I was unable to race his air force successfully. I did my best to try and bait him into putting a counter on his Aristocrat, but unlike game 1 he did not bite.


Game 3:  This game I drew an inordinately large number of removal spells and not nearly enough threats.  I think I was able to hardcast 2 of my 3 Bonfires and Spear down a couple of solo Aristocrats.  Eventually we got to a point in the match where I had him dead if I miracled my last Bonfire over the course of 2-3 turns, but I knew that was a very slim out.  Unfortunately I used up all my miracles in the previous round and I proceeded to shake his hand and wish him luck in the top 8.  In the end, I may very well have sideboarded horribly for this match up, but it was round 9 and I was certainly feeling the haze of many long battles at this point.


**1-2 (7-2)**



After the dust settled, I ended up in a respectible 12th place.  The prize support was a bit meager given the number of players and rounds we had to grind through, but as someone who goes to a good number of PTQs this is really nothing new.  I watched some of the top 8 and watched my friend finish up his top 16 finish in the SCG Elite IQ side event.


Overall I had a great time playing in the WMCQ and met a lot of interesting players.  I knew luck was certainly on my side (I think I only mulliganed twice in 9 rounds) to get that far, but it didn’t hold out long enough to grab one of the top 8 bragging rights playmats.

* Huntmaster of the Fells

I realized shortly after resolving it for the first time just how insane this card is. The power level is nuts to say the least.

We've seen a couple of UWr decks featuring 1-2 copies of Aetherling and then this past weekend a BUG Control deck was playing a single copy in their main deck.

My question to you is this - what do you think is (or could be) the best deck in standard featuring Aetherling as a finisher (and why)? I feel like this is the ""bomb"" true control decks have been waiting for since we lost the titan cycle.

Goes into more than just playing the game, but how we respond when we lose. Why it is important to learn to lose gracefully. Thought it was a good read and maybe worth talking about.

I know two mindsets I have worked hard to change in the last year (and I believe I am having better results because of it) are the following:

I've changed: **Man he is suck a sack, drawing exactly what he needed.**
Into: **What did I screw up last game?** If I felt like I made all the right plays - maybe my mistake was at the start **Should I have mulliganed that hand?**

Losing gracefully is hardest when it comes at the hands of a quick aggro/combo deck. Not going to lie - the first year I spent playing competitive magic I was a turd and often refused to shake the hand of a player that killed me before turn 4 (Charbelcher ack!). Coming from the casual magic I played for so long I didn't view these decks as ""real"" magic.

They are real magic though and I needed to be prepared for them. If I wasn't, I needed to lose gracefully when they took down a match.",,False,,t5_2utkz,False,,,True,t3_1e2h2o,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/1e2h2o/discussion_guttural_responses_or_why_we_should/,

Here's a look at the U/W/R Flash list Matt Costa took to Grand Prix Miami to a Top 8 finish:


Creatures (10)

3 Augur of Bolas

4 Restoration Angel

3 Snapcaster Mage


Lands (26)

2 Island

1 Cavern of Souls

3 Clifftop Retreat

4 Glacial Fortress

4 Hallowed Fountain

1 Moorland Haunt

3 Sacred Foundry

4 Steam Vents

4 Sulfur Falls


Spells (24)

4 Azorius Charm

2 Dissipate

1 Essence Scatter

3 Sphinx's Revelation

2 Syncopate

4 Think Twice

2 Turn

2 Warleader's Helix

3 Pillar of Flame

1 Supreme Verdict


Restoration Angel - 3W
When looking to create Value, very few cards do it better than Restoration Angel. Not only is the card a sizable body in the air that can come down on your opponent's turn to eat an unsuspecting attacker, it also generates additional value off of the other creatures in your deck, namely Augur of Bolas. It can also function as a 4 Mana Snapcaster Mage provided you've used one already and kept it on the board. It's very important to know WHEN to use your Angels. You only have 4, and you're really counting on it to swing through and win you the game. Try to be extremely conservative with the Angels unless you have both the hand and knowledge to create an opportunity.

Augur of Bolas - 1U
In the Flash deck, this card is an all-star. It comes down early, serves as a wall against any bear in sight, and also helps you dig for an appropriate answer off the top of your deck. He can also be recycled for his Enter the Battlefield effect with Restoration Angel.

Moorland Haunt - Land UW(T).
With no large win conditions in the main 60, you find yourself relying on somehow getting their life total to zero, and this card allows you to create extra value off of the creatures that have already done their duty. It's very nice that the tokens also have some form of evasion, allowing them to have a much higher success rate of swinging in and doing some damage. 


U/W/R Control

First, let's take a look at my personal deck-list of the control variety:


Instant (20)

3x Azorius Charm

2x Dissipate

1x Essence Scatter

1x Izzet Charm

2x Searing Spear

3x Sphinx's Revelation

2x Syncopate

2x Think Twice

2x Turn

2x Warleader's Helix


Enchantment (2)

1x Assemble the Legion

1x Detention Sphere


Creature (4)

1x AEtherling

3x Snapcaster Mage


Land (26)

3x Clifftop Retreat

1x Desolate Lighthouse

4x Glacial Fortress

4x Hallowed Fountain

1x Island

1x Plains

4x Sacred Foundry

4x Steam Vents

4x Sulfur Falls


Sorcery (7)

2x Pillar of Flame

2x Supreme Verdict

3x Terminus


Planeswalker (1)

1x Jace, Architect of Thought


AEtherling - 4UU
Your big haymaker. When played correctly, this card is effectively impossible to deal with for any opponent. He closes out games very quickly, can play both offense and defense despite the lack of Vigilance, and just generally does a great job at protecting both himself and you. More talk on him later, much like Countermagic and Snapcaster.


Assemble the Legion - 3WR
Playable as another vein of win condition. As soon as this card hits the field it puts a very intimidating clock on your opponent (although not nearly as fast as AEtherling) and is generally as hard, if not harder to deal with. It's important to remember just how much more important each counterspell you hold is while your Assemble is online, given that every answer they can possibly use against it short of killing you first can be countered. It's also important to remember that Assemble the Legion is a multicolored permanent and therefore you do NOT want to Renounce the Guilds while you have this card in play unless you safely have another card to sacrifice.


Desolate Lighthouse - Land 1UR(T)
While not as directly influential as Moorland Haunt is in the Flash variant, Desolate Lighthouse is a card that lets you turn late-game lands into answers. Once you're riding a safe amount of mana (generally 10+) you want to start activating Lighthouse whenever possible. One of the most practical applications in the deck is to attempt to Terminus on their turn using a Lighthouse activation. Even without that, it's a very reliable engine to sculpt your hand to exactly what you want to keep, thin out the chaff, and reach a win condition or Sphinx's Revelation.

Things I've been doing lately to try step up my game and avoid dumb mistakes:

* Draw cards slowly, placing them on the mat before looking at them, and looking at them before placing them in my hand. Fixes accidentally flipping the 2nd card, drawing two, and invalidating that much-needed Bonfire.

* Don't be afraid to ask someone to slow down their plays, and don't feel bad about saying ""I need to respond to that"" if they're rushing through plays. 

* Using pen and paper for life.

* Take notes after a round and try identify any bad plays.

SCG Opens, PTQs, a WMCQ and plenty of testing on the in-between (special thanks to my lovely wife for supporting me in all my cardboard endeavors). I’ve been playing so much in fact that after this past weekend in Columbus I’ve managed to hit the 1,500 PWPs mark for three GP byes without playing in any Grand Prix or winning a PTQ this season (yet!). 

At the last few events I’ve also met a pile of folks who lurk/post on here – always fun! If you see me at an event please feel free to introduce yourself.

Anywho – still playing the Loam deck in legacy, I had a twelfth place finish at the SCG Open in Columbus this past weekend. You can find my exact list [here]( http://sales.starcitygames.com//deckdatabase/displaydeck.php?DeckID=56695). If you’ve been following my deck you will note that the only change is the side board – where Slaughter Games is now making an appearance.

**Round 1 – Elves**

There are few things that make me happier when playing Loam than seeing my opponent’s first turn play be *Forest -&gt; Llanowar Elves*. Main deck Chalice of the Void, Punishing Fire and Devastating Dreaming this matchup is fairly good for me.

Sadly in game one I did not have any of the awesome cards I just listed. When my opponent tried to combo out with Glimpse of Nature, I had a well-placed Abrupt Decay on a Heritage Druid that prevented him from drawing his entire library. I was then able to untap, Burning Wish for a Perish and slaughter his army of little green men. I followed the Perish up with a Knight and some Wasteland pressure. Closing the game out before he recovered.

In game two he promptly scooped to my turn one Chalice of the Void on one.

1 – 0

**Round 2 – Gerry Thompson with Nivmagus Elemental Combo**

Gerry was playing a brew that seemed similar to the Nivmagus combo deck his team had played at the modern PT last year. He probed me on turn one and saw my slightly greedy keep – my hand contained a Chalice, Mox Diamond, Knight, Confidant, Library, Burning Wish and one very lonely land. After pondering he shipped the turn back to me.

Being the luck sack that I am, I ripped my second land on my first draw and promptly slammed a Chalice on the table – this yielded a concession.

The reason Gerry scooped when he did was to make it difficult for me to side board. I assumed he was on a combo deck of some sort so I mistakenly boarded out my Abrupt Decays. Thankfully I left in my Maze of Ith – just in case he was some new form of Show and Tell deck. He scooped to Maze on turn 5 in our second game.

2 – 0

**Round 3 – Charbelcher**

This is one of the very few legacy decks that really punishes players who do not sling Force of Wills. Thankfully it is also a fairly inconsistent deck – so it often does not do well in large events. That being said, I have never played against Char Belcher in a sanctioned match of magic and not gotten blown out on turn one twice.

I win the die roll and mulligan to six. I keep a fairly balanced hand that has a turn 2 Gaddock Teeg, a Devastating Dreams and some other goodies. He probes me, sees my Teeg and promptly puts ten Goblins on the table. I keep my cool, use my forest to cycle a land, untap, play a Plateau and put my Gaddock Teeg on the table.

I have a Teeg in play and a Dreams in my hand – I’m winning this game easy right? *Nope.* While I had a third land in hand I did not yet have a second red source. Plateau was the only red mana in my opening hand and both my cycle and my draw step missed. That means with Teeg blocking a goblin each turn I have two more draw steps to hit any of the following outs:

* 4 Wooded Foothils
* 4 Mox Diamond
* 2 Tiaga 
* 1 Badlands
* 2 Grove of the Burnwillows

Sadly, I missed and we went on to game two.

In game two I played a turn 1 Gaddock Teeg on the play, effectively ending that game.

In game three I was on the draw. After we had both agreed to keep our seven card hands I asked the question many legacy players have asked over the years:

*”Am I dead yet?”*

My Belcher opponent laughed, cycled a Probe and then killed me with a Charbelcher before I even took a turn.

My seven card hand contained a turn 1 Chalice of the Void, a Devastating Dreams, and a Knight. If I had been on the play *or* if he had gone off with Goblins again I’d have easily won. Remember magic is a game that is designed so the best player does not always win.

2 – 1

**Round 4 – ANT**

This round was against a player that had knocked me out of a PTQ top 8 in Indy a few weeks previous (mulligan to five and flooded out in game three). He won the whole thing though – so congrats Andrew!

That being said – he took some risky lines in our first game and got rewarded instead of punished. I had no idea what he was playing and I ended up keeping a six card hand that was good against fair decks. He kept a seven card hand that involved him probing me and then using a Lotus Petal to cast a Ponder in order to hit his first land drop. A few turns down the line I had no pressure on the table and no cards in hand. He deemed it necessary to try and “go off” with Past in Flames, with no tutor and simply three Probes in his graveyard – he got there.

In game two I had a seven that was very good. Turn one I played a Chalice for One off of a Mox Diamond and a Wasteland. I followed it up with a Chalice for Zero that same turn. He packed it in.

In game three I kept a six card hand that contained three lands, a Mox Diamond, Chalice and Knight. He Therapied my Chalice out on turn one and I didn’t draw another relevant spell for the remainder of the game.

2 – 2

**Round 5 – UR Delver**

This is one of those matches that ended the minute I resolved my Chalice of the Void on one. The only tricky thing to play around once I stuck that is Price of Progress (hint: you can wasteland yourself in response).

Took this match down in a quick 2-0

3 – 2

**Round 6 – High Tide**

Another die roll won, another Chalice of the Void turn one. Sadly I could not find a relevant clock to back up my disruption. I did however have time to Burning Wish for a Slaughter Games. Sadly – I misread what deck my opponent was playing, basic Islands and the Cunning Wish I saw him cast put my mind right to Omni-Tell. I cast Slaughter Games naming Enter the Infinite and promptly missed. He then Echoing truth’d my Chalice and combo’d off.

I learned a valuable lesson from this first game – when you are unsure which mono-blue deck they are playing, Slaughter Games naming Cunning Wish – both High Tide and Omni-Tell play this card.

Games two and three I ended up winning because I played out multiple Chalice of the Void on one and then Abrupt Decay’d my own Chalice when he tried to Echoing Truth all of them.

Oh and in game three I got to Slaughter Games his High Tides :D

4 – 2

**Round 7 – Dredge**

My opponent this round 100% should have mulliganed further in our first game. He kept a 5 that did actual nothing without top decking a land. I on the other hand kept a six that had a turn 1 Sylvan Library, into a turn 2 Loam+Dark Confidant and then my Knight on turn three ran away with the game. Really though – anything could have won when my opponent didn’t do anything until turn 4 aside from moving to discard :-/

Game two it was my turn to screw up my mulligans – I kept a hand that was a *very* poor choice against Dredge on the draw. I died very quickly.

Game three I mulliganed aggressively and was rewarded. My opponent dumping his opening hand with an LED and then used a Faithless Looting to dredge a pile of cards, sadly for him he missed hitting any Narcomoebas in the first third of his library. I cycled a land, started my next turn and bogged away all of his hard work. A Gaddock Teeg, Thalia and Wasteland later the game was locked up.

5 – 2

**Round 8 – Hive Mind**

Whew! I hadn’t played against this much combo in a long time.  Thankfully I knew what this guy was playing and my seven was well equipped to battle it. I won the die roll and had a turn 1 Sylvan Library into a turn 2 Burning Wish for Thoughtseize to take out one of his combo pieces. He fumbled around with cantrips for a while trying to assemble his three card combo. He did not find all of his pieces before I cast a Slaughter Games taking out his Hive Minds. 

In game two he had a turn two kill on the play. I kept a hand that had disruption, but not a Mox Diamond. Dems the beats sometimes.

In game three I led with a turn 1 Thalia on the play. My little hate bear in conjunction with Wastelands lead me to victory.

6 – 2

**Round 9 – BG Pox**

I was relieved to be playing against a fair deck for this last round. Even though I can hold my own against combo decks – those matches are always nail biters. I much prefer a good, grindy game of magic.

In game one he kept a land light hand that was only non-basics. I punished this with a few Wastelands and then clocked him out with a Knight.

In game two he tore apart my hand and killed my Dark Confidant. Thankfully he did not have land disruption as well and my Nantuko Monastery was able to race his Cursed Scrolled easily.

7 – 2

**Wrap Up**

I’m still enjoying playing the Loam deck and I’ve still be doing well with even though most people know when I am playing when I sit down across from them. If you enjoy playing grindy, interactive magic then there is no better deck in legacy for doing this than this loam shell!

Sadly I do not have any more standard/legacy events until the New Jersey SCG Invitational at the end of July (which I will be testing Dark Depths+Stage for). I’m off to figure out MM sealed before this weekend so I don’t waste my three byes at GP Vegas!

The creature quality is insane.  Voice, geist, reckoner are all amazing.  Experiment one is great in this deck and should be 3/3 almost every turn 3.

Im not crazy about the pacifisms in the board.  Seems like ground seal would be better there.  Also, as long as you have access to white, isnt unflinching courage better than volcanic strength?  Its not like you want to cast it on your one drop anyways.

Shadowborn Demon 3BB

Creature - Demon (M)

Flying

When Shadowborn Demon enters the battlefield, destroy target non-demon creature.

At the beginning of your upkeep, if there are fewer than six creature cards in your graveyard, sacrifice a creature.

5/6

I started my analysis in the other thread, but I think this card has constructed potential.

When you first cast him, you are way ahead.  He does something right away, which we all know is important, and that something is dreadbore.  Wow.   Now that you've already gotten roughly your card's worth, he sticks around for at least one turn and is freaking huge.  They are probably not attacking profitably on their turn unless they kill him (+1 cards).

Assuming he survives until your upkeep, he has the flexibility of going away or sticking around at the cost of a creature.  Certain decks (zombies, tokens) will have no trouble just feeding him and going to town.

God help them if you ever get 6 in the yard, in which case he is the best shriekmaw ever.

Other things to like:

* Great in an attrition war when you are likely to break 6 in the yard naturally.
* Blocks 5 power no problem.  This is where a lot of the other ""huge"" creatures in standard are.
* Plays really well with both of Domri Rade's abilities.  Domri always wanted a shriekmaw to play with in standard and this is a doozy.  Might even work in modern.
* Plays well with Restoration Angel.",,False,,t5_2utkz,False,,,True,t3_1aqp53,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/1aqp53/spoilershadowborn_demon/,

As you all know, no matter how powerful the spells in your hand are, they are much less valuable if you find yourself unable to cast them consistently. A question I pose very often when constructing decks is if I want perfect mana more consistently, or if I would rather have a mana base filled with powerful utility lands that is somewhat inconsistent.


Take [this deck](http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/azorius-aggro-01-04-13-1/) for example, while not strictly competitive, it should serve it's purpose as an example for our discussion. As you can see, the deck is almost mono-white, but splashed blue for a few cards.


The first 8 lands of out 22 card mana-base are easy enough, 4 of each shock and check in the colors. These produce either color of mana for the deck so 4 of each is an easy choice. After this, constructing the mana base becomes slightly more difficult.


3 Cavern of Souls seems like a good choice since it fixes our mana and at 3 we are fairly likely to see at least 1 copy each game. With 11 slots left, we could simply fill the rest of the deck with basics. If we were to do that, 9 plains and 2 islands would seem like the right number to me.


Testing the deck with this mana reveals that we almost always have the colors we need, great! Now we can tweak our mana-base to accommodate a few more utility lands to increase the over-all power level of the deck.


We only need the blue sources for 6 cards in the main deck, and cavern can produce the blue mana needed for geist, so why not cut the basic islands and add a couple of mutavaults? 


In testing we still consistently have our colors so we cut 1 plains to add a moorland haunt, which can be useful for grinding out games occasionally, or for feeding desecration demon. 


Now when we test the deck we have our colors most of the time, but we do occasionally come across hands that would be keepers if our utility lands were something else.


In summation, the question I am posing is at what point a mana-base becomes too greedy, is it better to cut utility lands for a more consistent mana-base?

1365826308.0,34,self.spikes,1c945b,[Modern] Let's discuss the viability of Elves with Beck // Call,43,9,63,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/1c945b/modern_lets_discuss_the_viability_of_elves_with/,"Hello spikes. There has been some discussion about whether or not Elves will soon be viable in modern with the printing of Beck // Call. I've seen it mentioned in a couple articles like [this one](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/legacy-weapon-mistakes-were-made/) and [this one](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/pvs-playhouse-dragons-maze-spoilers/). [Here](http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/modern-elves-08-04-13-2/) is a list that I have been working on for a little bit. It goldfishes pretty consistenly on turn 4 but it is possible to win on turn 3. Does anyone have any better lists? Any sweet technology?

Edit: Intruder alarm is really good if you have mana elves and either beck or regal force. It doesn't do anything if your hand is empty or if you dont have a way to draw cards. I think it deserves a one-of slot, probably not a two-of but it's possible. Thoughts?

Edit#2: I took out 2 lands for another deathrite and another archdruid. This deck really wants to have at least two lands in play and a dork. I had very few lands in at first and I probably overcompensated for mana screw. However, 20 lands seems like the right number. 

Edit#3: Replaced a land, a deathrite, and a regal force with three coiling oracles. Oracles do basically the same job just worse than any individually. The second regal force always felt extraneous and i feel comfortable cutting it with 4 pacts in the deck.

Edit#4:Has anyone tried birthing pod? Birthing pod seems to make things run smoothly and can be an alternate win condition by podding mana guys into coiling oracles or visionaries, then podding those into into archdruids (really bad against maelstrom pulse). Since the deck already wants dryad arbors, you can pod those into nettle sentinels and heritage druids.

1353690528.0,35,self.spikes,13o8oc,[Standard] The Power of Ultimate Price,39,4,66,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/13o8oc/standard_the_power_of_ultimate_price/,"So, I've been advocating Ultimate Price for a while now, much to the ridicule of just about everyone who plays Magic and is able to speak. And it was one of those cards that (like Deathrite Shaman before it) I knew was way too powerful not to play, and that it would just be a matter of time before people came around. The Esper Mageblade build that won a recent 5k has confirmed my suspicions. 

So, to evaluate the card, let's first look at it.

Cost: 1B. Very efficient for what we want it to do. Gets rid of a troublesome guy, we are probably paying less than that creature's converted mana cost if he is troublesome enough to bother spending a card on. This means we are likely to get a several mana tempo advantage from this resolving, and if we EOT or Combat trick it, we're likely to gain much more of an advantage than that. 

Type: Instant - Yes, just yes. This is so important. There are so few of these in this format. The next closest one is Murder. It may be better, but I don't think it is. It's a possibility that a deck could want to run both. More discussion on strategy in a moment though.

Rules Text: Destroy target mono-colored creature.
Now here's where people start to let their imagination run wild. ""Oh no, that's awful! Their Dracogenius is going to beat my face in! Their Armada Wurm will run amok!"" 

This is not the case. This card is only a dead card versus one real contender in the field, and that is Jund Midrange. Thragtusk means a net card disadvantage (though we still get a tempo swing), Olivia, Huntsmaster, Aristocrat aren't valid targets.

Yes, you're correct. The card is not good against Jund. While this is inconvenient, it's not terribly so... Because the deck that wants to play this spell gives Jund a very, very miniscule chance of making it even a 1-2 spread. Jund deals with tempo-aggro decks absolutely terribly, and that is where this card best finds a home. 

So what parts of Jund's deck most heavily interact with our creaturebase and gameplan? Thundermaw Hellkite, and Deathrite Shaman. And while the shaman is definitely problematic, decks are not playing 4 copies of him and he does not end our game. He makes our thoughtscours less efficient and our snapcasters less reliable, but that's fine. Thundermaw Hellkite just kills us, and it has the potential to be a one-sided sweeper with a body, haste, and no drawback. We can usually keep counter mana up for him, and that's fine. But he also can be cast off a Cavern. 

I know it seems like a long shot, but I have done my homework. The card feels just as good in testing as I thought it would, but it definitely is not for every list. It also depends on how much of your meta is jund midrange. Against every other deck this card has almost only good targets. The amount of multicolored creatures played in decks currently can be counted on one hand, maybe two. Two of these have hexproof, making it a moot point (Sigarda and Geist, things a list similar to the 5k 1st would not have trouble dealing with due to piked souls or other various dudes). Also, Armada Wurm's token is only green, and is a viable target for this card as well. This is card disadvantage, so let's think about that, but first...

I would also like to stress a final point. Card disadvantage is always bad for you. It is NOT always the incorrect decision! People are so slow to use cards that are not innately card advantageous because they think that means that card is just bad. That's not correct! I never feel bad for using Ultimate Price on a swinging Thragtusk. Yeah he gets a 3/3 dude, yeah it can swing in or block, and no my 10/2 Invisible Stalker doesn't care. He can no longer flicker the Tusk unless he burned his angel then, and I have 2 less power to worry about. The token also is easily blocked by a flashed restoration angel, providing more of that precious tempo advantage we are looking for.

This card (and the deck it finds its best home in) are worth your consideration! But I want to hear your opinions as well. What were your reasons for dismissing Ultimate Price? Do you think you were wrong to do so? Is Dreadbore really a necessity? Does the format merit playing instant speed removal?

1349520715.0,31,self.spikes,111d4v,Some lesser-known policy changes (in effect this weekend),32,1,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/111d4v/some_lesserknown_policy_changes_in_effect_this/,"Since this is the first weekend under the newly-issued Infraction Procedure Guide, it's probably useful to hit a couple points for those of you who may be playing in Competitive-enforcement events. The big change, of course, was to how triggers are handled, and the tl;dr is

* No more lapsing.
* You still aren't responsible for your opponent's triggers, and you still can't deliberately ""miss"" your own triggers.
* You can call a judge when your opponent misses a trigger; the judge decides if he gets a penalty, and you decide if the trigger gets put on the stack.

For some more exploration of that I'll just point you to [this article that goes over some situations in depth](http://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/10ix9a/the_new_trigger_policy_and_you_with_realworld/), and has links to Toby's summaries of the change.

Though that was the one that got headlines, it's not the only change in the new IPG. The rest are kinda minor, but for sake of completeness and knowledge, here they are.

**Failure to Reveal is now Game Rule Violation**

Previously, the infraction Failure to Reveal existed for situations like forgetting to show the card you fetched with Enlightened Tutor; it was meant to handle any case where revealing a card was necessary to demonstrate that an action was legal (so, *not* Dark Confidant, which is usually Missed Trigger instead). That infraction's been removed and its language has been folded into a clause that allows upgrading the penalty on Game Rule Violation.

**Extra cards in the deckbox**

You probably know (or should know) that if you have extra cards in your deckbox when you're being deck checked, we have to consider them to be part of your sideboard, and you'll probably get a Game Loss for Deck/Decklist Problem as a result. But there've been some exceptions, of varying levels of formality, for things like copies of your double-faced cards, or storing a promo card that you got at the tournament.

Now that's laid out formally in the IPG. So long as they're not sleeved the same as the rest of the deck, the following things in your deckbox won't result in a penalty:

* Promotional cards that have been handed out as part of the tournament.
* Double-faced cards represented by checklist cards in the deck.
* Double-faced cards being used to represent the ‘night’ side of cards in the deck.

**And one more thing**

Well, there is one more thing, but really it's not something you're ever going to need to worry about as a player. But for completeness' sake: if a card is in the wrong zone after a Game Rule Violation (say, a Zenith in the graveyard instead of shuffled in), we can ""partial fix"" by putting it in the correct zone. Used to be that was allowed within a turn cycle of the error. Now it's just within a turn.

And that's basically it. There were some changes in the Tournament Rules, mostly to support the rest of this (there's now some language in the communication policy about triggers, for example), as well as a flat ""no"" on using video replay to make rulings, but the IPG changes are the ones most likely to actually impact you, so please be aware of them as you head out to events this weekend.",,False,,t5_2utkz,False,,,True,t3_111d4v,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/111d4v/some_lesserknown_policy_changes_in_effect_this/,

1373932576.0,32,self.spikes,1idk4q,[Standard] Bant Hexproof in a Post M14 Meta,39,7,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/1idk4q/standard_bant_hexproof_in_a_post_m14_meta/,"M14 brought a lot of changes for Bant Hexproof, and a lot of potential new cards. It also brought new hate for Hexproof, and I was wondering what /r/spikes' opinions were on the impact of the new cards, and how much the new hate will affect the deck.

I've played the deck for a couple months now at several competitive REL events to good results, but I feel like a lot has changed. I'll go over my opinions on some cards I feel affect the deck.

**--- New Goodies ---**

**Gladecover Scout**: One of the obvious cards to talk about, being one of two new hexproof creatures. This card is most likely going to be in every M14 list, although I do think it will be very weak in certain situations. On the play it seems as though it would often be unable to attack on turn 2 without being blocked/killed, in multiples, and any time you draw it past turn 2. It does add much consistency to being able to find hexproof guys.

**Witchstalker**: The other new hexproof creature. I can't say I'm overly impressed with this creature however. As a 3-drop, it shares a slot with Geist of Saint Traft. 90% of the time, Witchstalker is a 3/3 hexproof for 3, whereas Geist is a 2/2 hexproof that swings for 6. I have actually been considering Fiendslayer Paladin as an alternative

**Fiendslayer Paladin**: I really like this card. It naturally has lifelink and first strike, so even a single Rancor makes it a legitimate, hard to block threat which will gain you a bunch of life. It is also essentially hexproof to every form of commonly played removal except Azorius charm. Even though it's a 2/2 as opposed to Witchstalker at 3/3, having real abilities and almost-hexproof makes it better in my opinion.

Other cards I have seen people consider: 

**Trollhide**: At 2 mana this might be playable, but 3 mana makes this play into Turn 4 Verdict and still die.

**Ajani's Chosen**: No. Despite the Enchantment synergy, this card is not anything hexproof wants to be doing, especially at 4 mana.

**Illusionary Armor**: 5 mana, no evasion... No.



**--- Hate Cards ---**

**Ratchet Bomb**: At 2 mana, this will most often be too slow to deal with Geist of Saint Traft and perhaps even Invisible Stalker, but could potentially be good at 1 charge counter, clearing all Rancors, Ethereal Armors, and Gladecover Scouts on Turn 3.

**Celestial Flare**: This could be a very effective hate card for hexproof. At 2 mana (albeit a demanding WW), it is low enough cost to be used before they die, and before you can start attacking with multiple threats.

Despite all this, I'm having trouble coming up with a real list that I want to bring to GP Calgary next weekend (26th-28th). This is the tentative creatures/spells I've been thinking of running. I'd like feedback on it though.

**--- Tentative Decklist ---**

**Creatures (19)**

* 3 Avacyn's Pilgrim (need even more white mana for Fiendslayer Paladin)
* 4 Gladecover Scout (not sure if 4 is a correct number, as these are generally terrible in multiples)
* 4 Invisible Stalker
* 4 Geist of Saint Traft
* 4 Fiendslayer Paladin (4 may be overly ambitious, but I really like this card)

**Spells (3)**

* 3 Simic Charm

**The rest of it (38)**

* 16 Enchantments
* 22 Land

**Cards in contention**:

* Voice of Resurgence - defense against offensive decks, resilient, punishes control. Less relevant with more hexproof threats
* Fencing Ace - still kills them faster than any hexproof threat
* Strangleroot Geist - probably sideboard, a resilient threat that hits the turn it comes down
* Loxodon Smiter - never saw the appeal of this card and never ran it, still won't
* Witchstalker - although hexproof, don't think it deserves a slot
* Silverblade Paladin - everyone loves doublestrike, but I think I would rather have Ajani for the same cost
* Ajani - gives flying+doublestrike to a creature for 3 mana, often just puts them dead, harder to remove than Silverblade and gives evasion
* Selesnya Charm - +2/+2 trample is nice, but the other modes are lacking. Bounce from Simic Charm is preferrable, and enchants will often give trample, so +3/+3 is just better. With less hexproof threats the 3rd mode gets worse, but can still protect enchantments from Ray or Abrupt Decay

Potential Changes:

* Cut 1 Gladecover Scout and 1 Fiendslayer and add 2x of cards in contention? Pros: get more diverse threats, less bad draws with 2+ Gladecovers, go bigger. Cons: Less likely to have a Gladecover in starting hand, fewer hexproof threats (unless Witchstalker is added).

* Cut some number (1x?) of Simic Charms. Pros: could run more threats now that the hexproof mode is less relevant. Cons: lose versatile card, buff and bounce give good utility to win games

* ???

1364750053.0,31,self.spikes,1bd6kz,Junk Rites pilots: We're public enemy number one now. How do we adapt?,47,16,52,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/1bd6kz/junk_rites_pilots_were_public_enemy_number_one/,"**My last list, at SCG IQ Dayton on 3/23:** http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/just-another-junk-rites/

It should go without saying that Junk Rites is one of, if not the best deck in the format right now. On a personal note, this is an odd feeling for me. I arrived at playing this deck a few weeks before it became popular, based on a decision to play my favorite cards in the format, and build a deck in which nearly every card was a source of card advantage. Making a few tweaks, I arrived at a list very similar to the top lists we're seeing now. Previously, decks I'd taken to large tournaments had been sub-par due to my own self-imposed mental restrictions. Having beaten that barrier, I'm both excited to see my deck choice performing so well and made nervous because I know the field is going to be looking to beat this deck specifically. 

___


So, in another thread, the top suggestion for beating us is a Bant Control list, similar to Melissa DeTora's [Wolf Run Bant revision](http://magic.tcgplayer.com/db/article.asp?ID=11090). The proposed list plays the same advantage-generating creatures we do, but opts for permission cards instead of the digging engines and utility cards we play. This is...troubling. The deck obviously has no difficult generating as much advantage as we do, and a Sphinx's Rev or two makes it very difficult to beat. 

How should we beat this? Do we tune the deck to operate faster, rushing to a Craterhoof and ending outright? How do we modify our boards accordingly? Even with only 3 exiling counterspells, is it advisable to run 2 Caverns in the main instead of 1 main, 1 side? 

---

Let's talk card options. Many of our lists look very similar, but there are a small number of slots open to adjustment. 


**Land Count**: I was as high as 25, but since the newest tweaks have dropped to 24. Many lists are flipping between 23-24, with those at 23 opting for as high as 7 mana dorks. While this helps us to be incredibly explosive, it's not often a move I feel comfortable making. Those of you with low lands, high dorks: How has your mana situation been?

**Mana Dorks**: This goes hand in hand with the previous paragraph, namely, that more dorks should accompany lists with fewer lands. Obviously, our playset of Avacyn's Pilgrims should be filled out before our Arbor Elves. I've been playing only 4 Pilgrims, no Elves. How have the Elf lists been performing? Are the extra dorks necessary to the deck? Could Farseek be a potential replacement?

**Liliana of the Veil** This is where my unused Elf slots have gone, and truthfully, she has been excellent. It's hard to take measure of just how disruptive her +1 has been against the late-game decks, but she certainly has been effective to some extent. Coupled with Lingering Souls and Centaur Healers, she provides us another option for us to stabilize with 3 mana against control.

**Lingering Souls**: This card has been popping in and out of mainboards. I think it's too crucial to the deck's advantage engine to cut entirely, since it also helps us stabilize against aggro (Suck it, Falkenrath Aristocrat!) Somewhere between 2-3 seems like the right number. I've opted for 3.

**Sever the Bloodline**: I have not played with this card yet, but dear god it seems effective. The deck doesn't mind getting to 7 mana, so the flashback cost is hardly prohibitive. Having access to another flashback card, and a very important removal spell, allows the deck to operate without disrupting its search engine. How many ought we play between the main and side?

**Abrupt Decay**: In the main, this kills: Detention Sphere, Boros Reckoner, Liliana of the Veil, Snapcaster Mage, any of Naya Blitz's creatures. Which decks is it least effective against in the main? I'm looking to play a total of 3 in the 75.

**Random techy shit: Cloudshift** Hitting Angel of Serenity with it is cool, especially with the permanent exile trick. Hitting Craterhoof with it post-Rites can turn a ""meh"" Craterhoof board state into a ""Sooo, you're dead?"" board state. It's a cheaper Restoration Angel for Thragtusk and is effective but not exciting on a Centaur Healer. Ultimately, I'd like to play 2, but it's still a card that relies on others to be effective. It will probably not make the cut. 

---

I'll try to edit this section to add a sideboard discussion in a bit, but it's homework and family time. I do believe sideboarding is one of, if not *THE*, most important part of Standard metagaming, once you have a top-tier deck in your hands, so I'd love to start out with some discussion about that as well.

---

Quick blurbs on sideboard cards and ideas that I'll expand throughout the day:

**Golgari Charm** : Incredibly versatile against UWx. ""Counters"" a Verdict, destroys RIPs and D Spheres.


**Loxodon Smiter** : If Bant is the deck to beat, apply uncounterable pressure directly to the forehead? How good is this guy against the rest of the field?

**Obzedat, Ghost Council** : Against decks with Slaughter Games, he came in from the side as a one-of. Alternate win conditions are good. Breaks stalemates quite effectively. Benefits from Resto Angel and my stupid Cloudshift tech.


**Acidic Slime** : Haven't played this card either, which is more than likely a mistake. Blows up everything. Gets reanimated and Resto'd. What have I been doing with my life?

**Abrupt Decay** : I've been attempting to play 3 of these. Do these get replaced by Slime?

**Deathrite Shaman** : He's a Swiss Army Knife, but against what? Probably gonna shoot for 2.

**Rhox Faithmender** : Haven't played this card, just don't want to. I can't get behind it. Even if it is good. 

**Somberwald Sage** (*proposed by /u/CRANKred*) : Not a fan myself, although she's certainly a possibility. She is another method to help us operate without the graveyard. She's often underwhelming without a follow-up card in hand.

**Garruk Relentless** (*proposed by /u/TwoTwoBearz, whose name I just now understand*) : Planeswalker fights are GREAT against the decks that want to play the long game.

1363572731.0,34,self.spikes,1ai0my,[Modern] Let's talk about Eggs.,53,19,103,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/1ai0my/modern_lets_talk_about_eggs/,"If you saw GP San Diego then you just saw the eggs pilot rip through two of the highest ranked pro's in modern. You saw him beat Kibler when Kibler had two lands in play, a Deathrite Shaman and two Tarmogoyfs. You saw him beat a R/W/G/B good stuff deck when the pilot had 3 Lands in play and through an Aven Mindcensor and two Fulminator Mage's.

But most of all you watched the most boring games of Magic I have literally ever seen.

Let's go over some shit. The Eggs pilot did not stall the game. He won his games in between other games, proving the ""deck takes too long to win"" argument as blatant bullshit. He piloted the deck flawlessly and respectably and no one should think any less of him for it.

During the semi-finals the table had TWO spectators. Both of the Marshall's were constantly commenting on how boring it was to watch the Eggs match up.

Brian Kibler wrote ""F6"" on a piece of paper and got up from his table while the Eggs deck combo'd off. For those of you unaware F6 on MODO means ""pass priority"". So Kibler was basically being extremely rude to the pilot. He did the same at the previous PTQ, and has tweeted his distaste for the deck. But it was funny as fuck.

Reshape + Lotus Bloom is essentially Tinker + Black Lotus in modern, though Eggs is the only deck that really takes advantage of it. Seeting Song is banned and yet this is allowed.

Let me quickly state that I am not for Eggs being banned at this point in time. I think this GP is going to be a real eye opener for anyone participating in Modern to be better prepared for Eggs in the future. Rest In Peace/Extirpate can go a long way and it's very clear by many main deck choices that people didn't expect Eggs to sweep the way it did.",,False,,t5_2utkz,1363573402.0,,,True,t3_1ai0my,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/1ai0my/modern_lets_talk_about_eggs/,
1361758978.0,30,self.spikes,19617c,[Modern] Kiki-Pod PTQ Report,35,5,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/19617c/modern_kikipod_ptq_report/,"I played [this version](http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/kiki-pod-24-02-13-1/) of Kiki Pod Saturday at a PTQ. For those of you unfamiliar with the achetype, Kiki Pod is a 4c deck that abuses Birthing Pod to gain incremental advantage, tutor silver bullets for specific matchups, and to combo out with Kiki Jiki + Deceiver Exarch/Zealous Conscripts/Restoration Angel. 

Some of the wrinkles in the maindeck: -1 Wall of Roots for +1 Wall of Omens (to help against the grindy control decks), + 1 Glen Elendra Archmage for -1 Ethersworn Canonist (storm is relatively dead atm and I expected lots of U decks and Tron at this event), and the biggest change, -1 Izzet Staticaster for +1 Deceiver Exarch. The 2nd Exarch was amazing for me, early game you can go from Wall of Roots/Omens to a 4 drop on the same turn if you have to and late game you can still kill on a cmc 1 and a cmc 2 creature, at least 4 mana, Pod, and at least 9 life, plus you can get the rare kill with 2 cmc 2 creatures (most people don't see this coming). 

On to the event!

**Round 1**

My opponent is on UWR Flash and game 1 is relatively bland with me resolving a Pod and grinding him down with Kitchen Finks podded into Restoration Angel repeatedly. 

I sideboarded +2 Qasali Pridemage, +2 Combust, +2 Dispel for -2 Pod, -1 Murderous Redcap, -1 Linvala, -1 Aven Mindcensor, -1 Bird of Paradise. Most decks have some sort of Torpor Orb/Pithing Needle/Stony Silence hate they bring in so Qasali Pridemage comes in in almost every matchup. 

Game 2 I play the midrange plan and eventually kill my opponent with powerful cards and incremental advantage. Honestly, there's not much else to talk about in this match. Plus I don't remember much of it.

**Round 2** 

My opponent is on Bogle (GW Auras). Game 1 I'm on the play and turn 1 Hierarch into turn 2 Wall of Roots while he goes turn 1 Hexproof dude, turn 2 Rancor. I play Pod turn 3 and sac Hierarch for a Spellskite, effectively locking him out of the rest of the game. 2 turns later I draw Kitchen Finks, pod it for Resto Angel and kill him next turn podding Angel for Conscripts (untap Pod), Pod Finks for Resto (flicker Conscripts), untap pod with Conscripts, Pod Resto for Kiki-Jiki. In come the Paths and the Pridemages, out go Wall of Omens, Mindcensor, Linvala, and Redcap. 

Game 2 he puts a lot of pressure on me with a double rancor'ed hexproofer. I am at 2 with Birds, Harmonic Sliver, and Wall of Roots in play 4 lands in (2 that make red), and Birds, Restoration Angel, Kiki Jiki in hand. He has a Spirit Mantle on his Hexproofer, another Bogle and a Dryad Arbor in play. I play my Birds and pass with 3 lands open. He attacks (his hand was empty) with everything and I flicker my Sliver before blockers, killing the Spirit Mantle, I block the 5/1 with 0/4 Wall of Roots, Resto on his Hexproofer and Sliver on Dryad Arbor taking 1 and going to 1. I untap and kill him with a infinite 3/4 fliers from Kiki-Jiki.

2-0

**Round 3**

My opponent is on Infect and I'm on the play. I go turn 1 Hierarch, turn 2 Wall of Roots and he plays a turn 2 Blighted Agent. I play my 3rd land and pass, holding Decever Exarch and Kiki Jiki in hand along with a 3rd red source. He plays an inkmoth and casts double Groundswell followed up with Mutagenic Growth, he then moves to combat and I attempt to tap his Agent down with Deceiver but he has the Apostles Blessing and I'm dead. Nice turn 3 kill &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;


Sideboarding I brought in the Dispels, Izzet Staticaster, Ancient Grudge, and Paths for -2 Kitchen Finks, -1 Aven Mindcensor, -1 Chord of Calling, -1 Linvala, , and -1 Restoration Angel.

Game 2 I had a similar opening with him hitting with a turn 1 Glisener Elf except turn 3 I played Pod, saccing Noble Hierarch for Spellskite leaving Hallowed Fountain up for the and Dispel and Path in my hand. He EOTed nature's claimed my Spellskite after I countered his Dismember. Next turn he killed me with double Groundswell + Apostles Blessing on green. 

2-1

**Round 4**

The Kiki-Pod mirror. Game 1 my opponent played a turn 2 pod of Noble Hierarch which I punished with a turn 3 Pod (Bird and Wall of Roots in play) saccing Wall of Roots for Harmonic Sliver. He follows this up with a Qasali Pridemage next turn on my pod. I draw Pod and turn Harmonic Sliver into Linvala. Two turns later I kill him after he Chorded for Phantasmal Image on Linvala and I untap and kill with a 2 and a 1 drop. 

Game 2 I keep a loose hand with just Bird, double pod, chord and 2 lands. He casts turn 3 Glen Elendra with U open and then proceeds to kill me shortly after with a Gavony Township. 

Game 3 he makes a misplay and I punish him for it. This game was an utter clusterfuck and I barely remember anything from it other than I won. 

**Round 5**

My opponent is on Affinity and drops a turn 1 Vault Skirge and Ornithopter followed by a turn 2 Steel Overseer. I went turn 1 Bird into turn 2 Wall of Roots. He plays another Skirge and then hits me for 5 in the air from the Overseer activation. I cast Pod into Harmonic Sliver and kill the Overseer. He hits me for 5 again and I'm at 7. Next turn I Pod the Bird into a Phantasmal Image to blow up both of his Vault Skirges as a copied Harmonic Sliver (we had about a 4 minute delay as I had to call a judge to explain the interaction to my opponent). I go to 6 from the Ornithoper then cast Kitchen Finks (go to 8) Pod away Finks (at 10) and then flicker it with Restoration Angel (go to 12) my opponent top decks Cranial Plating with 5 artifacts on the field but it doesn't matter. I kill him the following turn with a Googol of Restoration Angels. 

In come the Paths, Pridemages, Ancient Grudge, and Staticaster. 

Game 2 is a similar story with my opponent doing very little against my Wall of Omens as he opened up with Memnite and Signal Pest. I follow it up with a Pod for Kitchen Finks and two turns later he's dead despite casting Blood Moon.

**Round  6**

I heard whispers from my friends before the tournament about Mono Blue Tron but I had no idea what to expect when I saw my opponent go turn 1 Island turn 2 Urza's Tower. Regardless, I kept a lightning fast hand and killed him turn 5 on the play when he tapped out turn 4 for a Solemn Simulacrum after I podded for turn 3 Mindcensor thanks to Birds + Spellskite. 

In comes Avalanche Riders + Paths and Pridemages, out goes Linvala, Wall of Omens, 2 Kitchen Finks, and Murderous Redcap.  

Game two he plays two tron pieces and turn 1 map. I played a bird turn 1 and then fetched for a shock and passed turn 2. He failed to crack his map on his turn or in response to my fetch (I have no idea why people wait to do this EOT) so I punish him by flashing in Aven Mindcensor and he fails to find. He plays an Island next turn and passes. I attempt to cast Pod but get Remanded. He top decks his tron piece and cast's Sundering Titan killing all my lands. I Path his Titan next turn (blowing up his Island) off Birds, but I died 6 turns later (he was at 6 from Mindcensor beats) to Emrakul. 

Game 3 I keep a hand that's dorks, lands and turn 3 Avalanche Riders. I cast the Riders turn 3 and keep him off Tron. I pay the Echo cost (hoping to hit something to tutor for or draw, Resto, Kiki, or Phantasmal Image) and start beating for 2 until he casts Solemn. He reassembles Tron and casts Platinum Angel. I proceed to top deck Kiki-Jiki to break up his tron again. He puts me to 10 via Angel while I strip mine him every turn while drawing Aven Mindcensor, locking him out of tutors. I finally draw Chord of Calling and cast it for Phantasmal Image copying his Angel. I proceed to beat him down with a 5/5 angel via Noble Hierarch and then draw a Pridemage to beat him down to 4 and threaten to kill him next turn on turn 1 before we draw. Next turn I pop the pridemage and kill him with the Phantasmal Image. 

**Round 7**

I'm in 6th going into this round and am unfortunately paired against the player in 8th in a win and in. He's on Splinter Twin (with green splash). Game 1 I am forced to mull to 4 on the play while he keeps 7. I keep Bird, Temple Garden, Phantasmal Image, Linvala. He plays turn 2 Spellskite and I top deck a Hierarch. He passes on turn 3 and in my upkeep taps my Bird down with Pestermite. I Phantasmal Image his Spellskite and he seems quite unhappy (I assume he has Twin in hand). He starts searching for answers and passes while I top deck a land and slam Linvala on the field. He Remands a Restoration Angel twice but eventually it sticks as does another Angel and the Angel beatdown plan begins. He filters 3 Dispels from his and and eventually casts 2 Izzet Charms on my Linvala. I Spellskite the 2nd one (causing my Image to die) and he dies the next turn to Angel beatdown.

In comes the Dispels, the Paths, the Pridemages, the Combusts, and the Staticaster. 

Game 2 I die terribly with a loose keep.

Game 3 I draw all my removal and a Dispel. I resolve a Pod and Pod for Finks followed by Podding Finks for Resto turn 4. Turn 5 he Grudges my Pod and then taps down a land in my upkeep via Pestermite. He attempts to Kiki me and I path his Kiki in response. Next turn I top deck a Chord, Chord where x=5 and kill him. 

**Top 8 R1**

I had the #1 seed going in and knew I was playing against RBg Burn. Game 1 he kills me with burn followed up by Deathrites to seal the game a turn before I would kill him. 

In come 2 Obstinate Baloth, 2 Path, 2 Dispel. (I knew my opponent had no Torpor Orbs). 

Game 2 I slow him down with Wall of Roots followed up by a pod into Kitchen Finks. Next turn I pod the Finks away but he eats it with the persist trigger on the stack, and I grab Obstinate Baloth to put me to 12. He Bumps me and then passes. I cast Kitchen Finks and then Pod it to Restoration Angel to flicker the Baloth. He casts another burn spell but is down to 1 card (I've put him on land since he's only casting 1 burn spell a turn). I Pod for Kiki Jiki and proceed to make a silly play mistake, with my opponent at 20 I name Googol as the number of Restoration Angels I'm creating. I attack and he doesn't have the Rakdos Charm to punish me (the correct number was 7 angels).

Game 3 He opens with Vexing Devil and I opt to take the 4. He top decks Goblin Guide and puts me to 18 after I played Grove and Birds. He follows this up with another Devil which I again opt to take the 4 so I can play Wall of Roots (followed by t3 Deceiver and turn 4 Kiki). He attacks into my Wall with Guide and then Searing Blazes me to 7 and casts Deathrite. I EOT fetch to go to 6 and then cast Finks to go to 8, play a land and pass. He attacks into my Finks with Guide and I block, he eats the Finks with the trigger on the stack again and suspends rift bolt followed by a bump to put me to 5. I cast Deceiver on his upkeep and die to his Deathrite in response. :(

I sided out Linvala and Redcap against Burn as I didn't consider Deathrite to be the main threat. This was clearly wrong and I was punished for it. The matchup is extremely difficult anyway as Pod LOVES killing itself (I've done 16 damage to myself before).",,False,,t5_2utkz,False,,,True,t3_19617c,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/19617c/modern_kikipod_ptq_report/,

I have myself at 7, and my opponent at 9, documented on a notepad, well over a mile long. My opponent has used only a spin down die the entire match.

Towering thunderfist, millinium gargoyle, knight of obligation and 1 irrelevant creatures on my side. My opponent has 4 untapped non-flyers (including a newly summoned cinder elemental), a sunhome guild mage with one thousand lashes on it, as well as the b/w guy that cat give target creature lifelink. Opp has no cards in hand, I have 2. I tap 4, act of treason with extort targeting the b/w guildmage guy. Resolves, I note life change: me 8, opp 8. I stop, move my land around and look at other options. I move to attack, and cast the 1W +1/+1 and flying/first strike on my thunderfist, with extort. note change: me 9, opp 7. I attack all out, forcing him to block (and kill) all of his creatures, or die) Opp says ""so that would put me at 1?"" I look at his spindown - 8.

 At this point, [Judge] pulls me aside, and demands I explain every single life change on my note pad. I point out what changes I have documented. At this point, I am a little miffed, because the burden of proof is being placed solely on me only because my opponent does not care to write down life totals, but instead use a die (wtf). Nevertheless, I show my math. [Judge] states ""I believe you are taking advantage of your opponents lack of proper life total tracking, and I am going to have to DQ you"". I first point out, that no matter if he is at 7 or 8, the guy is dead on the board no matter what. He wants to hear none of it, and says again he is DQing me. I then ask Andrew ""are you accusing me of cheating?"" he responds ""yes"". I respond (I admit a bit hastily) ""Go fuck yourself"". What transpired afterwards was pretty much an insistence on [Judge]'s part that I am a cheater, and a stream of F-bombs and requests for him to perform certain anatomically improbable acts.

I want to be clear: I am in no way excusing my colorful language. In my defense, 10+ years ago, you would have been hard pressed to find a single individual who was more vocal than myself when it came to fighting cheating in Magic. I don't take accusations (especially ones such as this) of cheating being made against me lightly. 

Just looking for any opinions on what transpired here. Who was ""in the right""? if anyone. Should the judge have acted the way he did? Why was the burden of proof placed only on me, and the fact that my opponent was using a freaking spindown ignored, and he was just believed to be correct?",,False,,t5_2utkz,False,,,True,t3_18a6a4,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/18a6a4/discussion_dq_at_a_gp_trial/,

I'd like to say huge props to WestCan Events for allowing online registration.  Very convenient to not have to line up at the event site, and registering online allowed you to secure your playmat early.  

**Round 1** BYE  

1-0

**Round 2** BYE  

2-0

**Round 3** vs. Bob Thompson (Affinity) 2-0

I was very excited to get the tournament underway.  Bob mulliganed to 6 while I kept my opening 7.  He led with Inkmoth Nexus, Signal Pest go.  I played land, Birds of Paradise.  He had no follow-up play as he missed his second land drop.  I then played land, Loxodon Smiter.  He still had no follow-up play, again missing a land drop.  A turn 3 Wilt-Leaf Liege from me led to an early concession as he was facing down a 6/6 Loxodon Smiter.  

For game 2, Stony Silence, Creeping Corrosion, and Kataki, War's Wage all came in.  My opening 7 was very nice, consisting of both Kataki and Stony Silence.  My opponent also kept on 7, playing Inkmoth Nexus, Memnite, Memnite, Mox Opal.  I played land, Birds of Paradise.  He then played Inkmoth Nexus, Blood Moon off his Mox Opal, attacking me down to 18.  Thankfully Birds of Paradise enabled me to be free to cast spells from under Blood Moon, casting a turn 2 Kataki, War's Wage.  Bob shook his head at that and sacrificed all of his artifacts on his third turn's upkeep.  He then played a third Inkmoth Nexus and attempted to attack me with one of them.  I pointed out that Blood Moon made them all Mountains, and he promptly conceded.

3-0  

**Round 4** vs. Jamie Hennessey (Gifts Control) 2-1

Looking at my life pad sheets, I wish I took better notes.  Although this one has a very large 'DEATHRITE SHAMAN' written across game 1, where my life total depleted from 20 to 0 in increments of 2, then 4 as he added a second to the board.  

For game 2, two copies of Lingering Souls backed up by Gavony Township and Wilt-Leaf Liege had him dead on turn 5 before he could muster any kind of defense.  

Game 3 was more of the same as my Lingering Souls proved better than his Lingering Souls backed by Gaddock Teeg and Thalia, Guardian of Thraben prevented him from casting the sweepers in his hand.  

4-0  

**Round 5** vs. Lawrence Wight (Living End) 2-0

The only damage I took in this entire match were off my own lands.  In game 1 he cycled a bunch of creatures and never found a cascade spell.  

In game 2 I brought in Chalice of the Void, Ethersworn Canonist, Relic of Progenitus, and Rule of Law.  Needless to say, that did not end well for him.  

5-0

**Round 6** vs. Melissa DeTora (BW Tokens) 1-1-1  

This one was a very interesting match.  Both of us had powerful spells to back up Lingering Souls and the games were interactive.  

I took game 1 despite Melissa casting multiple Auriok Champions.  I distinctly recall Orzhov Pontiff eating her entire team and allowing me to kill her from 17 life.  

In game 2 she correctly identified the power of Orzhov Pontiff and it was promptly Tidehollow Sculler'd out of my hand, while Mirran Crusader did short work of my life total.

Game 3 saw a turn 2 Gaddock Teeg eat an early Dismember as she had double Windbrisk Heights followed by a Spectral Procession.  I was forced to Path one of the Spirits before combat to prevent the Heights from getting activated.  We traded blows down to 3 and 7 life respectively before turn 5 on time came, ending the game in a draw with Baneslayer Angel on my side and Hero of Bladehold on the other side.  She asked me to concede which I obviously declined, which kept Melissa and I right next to each other in the standings and the top tables all tournament.  

5-0-1  

**Round 7** vs. Franz Ombico (Scapeshift) 2-0  

My opponent led with Blood Crypt and Overgrown Tomb into Prismatic Omen, which immediately had me put him on Scapeshift.  However, a turn 3 Dark Confidant had me a bit confused, as I ate his Bob with an Orzhov Pontiff.  A Jund Charm as Pyrcolasm during my turn 4 attack step slowed down my assault, but was ultimately futile.  

The Jund Charm and Bob had me confused as I had not seen anyone play those in Scapeshift recently.  He cast a few ramp spells as well as Prismatic Omen, however that was eaten by a Qasali Pridemage in game 2.  He was up to 6 lands while staring down lethal attacks, causing him to attempt to kill me from 14 life with Scapeshift, but failed to take account of the lifegain I had with Deathrite Shaman, ending the game at 1 life.

6-0-1 

**Round 8** vs. Omar Beldon (Jund) 2-0  

Finally, my first Jund opponent of the tournament.  This was the deck I was prepared for.  And prepared I was.  Both of our games were extremely grindy, but Fauna Shaman proved its dominance, fetching double Baneslayer Angel to seal the game.  

In game 2 he brought in some really strange cards like Slaughter Pact and Thragtusk, but ultimately died to my superior Lingering Souls.  

And with that I locked myself in for day 2, something I was really proud of.

7-0-1  

**Round 9** vs. Charles Wiper (Jund) 0-2  

Alas, I finally meet defeat.  Charles was playing Jund sans Lingering Souls.  He correctly identified that he had to quickly kill my mana creatures in this matchup.  I had to take a double mulligan in game 1 and lost the attrition war.  And double Bloodbraid Elf from him in game 2 sent me out of the ranks of the undefeated.  

7-1-1

----------

**[P1p01](http://i.imgur.com/B8cCiZ9.jpg)**: This wasn't an easy first pick. No huge bombs, plenty of cards in both Simic and Boros, almost nothing for Orzhov or Dimir. There are enough cards here in Boros and Simic that it's pretty much impossible to send a decent signal, but on the plus side, I'm almost guaranteed to wheel something decent for any of those decks. I finally settled on Mystic Genesis here with 3 seconds on the timer because it's a huge hit in the midgame and Simic is my favorite guild so far. I think it's the best Simic card here, but I could have gone Boros/Gruul with Martial Glory or the very overrated Madcap Skills.

**[P1p02](http://i.imgur.com/XvCAqaB.jpg)**: And now I hate my first pick. Couple of decent Simic cards here (Frilled Oculus, Ivy Lane Denizen, Charger) but the best card in the pack is Arrows of Justice by a mile. It's good removal in the best colors and its mana is very flexible and splashable. There is no way I'm forcing simic with this in the pack.

**[P1p03](http://i.imgur.com/sLfZya6.jpg)**: As usual, i now regret pick 2. No red at all in the pack, and a single Orzhov card. The simic is very good tough with Sapphire Drake, Slaughterhorn and even Spell Rupture. My pick here is Sapphire Drake as he is a fantastic finisher in a good Simic deck. I hope to table something, probably the Spell Rupture, but one can always hope for Slaughterhorn or the overcosted Merfolk guy.

**[P1p04](http://i.imgur.com/Nv4Ikpp.jpg)**: Decent cards in every colour except Gruul. Two good Boros 2-drops but at this point I think I'd rather follow the signal from p3 and grab the card that is the backbone of every good simic deck: Cloudfin Raptor! I'd really like to wheel the Snapjaw here but I think it's asking too much with all the crap in the pack.

**[P1p05](http://i.imgur.com/4MIZNcI.jpg)**: Pretty strong signal for Orzhov being open here, which is weird since the first packs were pretty bad. In retrospect I think someone on my right might have switched colors around that time, probably from Gruul/Orzhov into Simic. Back to me; there's not much for me in this pack. I hesitated a long time between Burst of Strength and Totally Lost, but finally went for the semi-removal (which I hate more and more everytime I play it). I think BoS was the pick here, or switch colors and go Orzhov.

**[P1p06](http://i.imgur.com/HC0AuZm.jpg)**: And now Gruul is showing up all over the place, giving some weight to the guild-swap theory above. A Red splash in a simic deck can be pretty good and I really like Ember Beast but I really wanted to send a signal on my left to stay out of my colors (since the first couple of packs were sure to push them into Simic :S) so I picked the Rust Scarab. I think Ember Beast was the pick here since it works so well with cloudfin Raptor and allows me to splash for Arrows of Justice.

**[P1p07](http://i.imgur.com/tWnZdhB.jpg)**: Pretty awful pack here, but there is one awesome standout: Frilled Octopus, come over here!

**[P1P08](http://i.imgur.com/HS7ygfV.jpg)**: This pack is pretty much empty except for the Gateway Shade (those kind of cards are always pretty good in heavy black decks) and the goblin (good in Boros aggro). I pick the beefy scarab in hopes to send a signal again.

**[P1p09](http://i.imgur.com/174UAjw.jpg)**: Let's see what went around the table... 2/5 simic cards and 1/4 for boros. I'll gladly take the Shambleshark here as I think it was the third best simic card in the original pack (only a bit behind Elusive Krasis) and someone is going to be stoked about a very late Martial Glory.

**[P1p10](http://i.imgur.com/z5NTSgB.jpg)**: I tabled the Charger here, which seems insane to me, this dude is pretty good in my deck so I won't complain.

**[P1p11](http://i.imgur.com/CcSt8gz.jpg)**: Well I wheeled the crappy cards in my colors. I chose the draw spell, but I think the counterspell would have been much better.

-------

First pack ends without giving me much more playables, but I feel i'm on a pretty decent start. I'm kind of bummed about passing so many good cards in my colors early tough and I'm not exactly confident in pack two.

-------

**[P2p01](http://i.imgur.com/iNCZDum.jpg)**: Well, the rare is not playable in my colors and Boros Charm is not worth much on MTGO. My options are Nimbus Swimmer, Greenside Watcher and Simic Guildgate. I pick the swimmer hoping to wheel the Gate (which is likely with all the good Boros/Orzhov/Dimir cards in here)

**[P2p02](http://i.imgur.com/G4yfPnr.jpg)**: Pick for me here are Either Frilled Oculus or Slaughterhorn, but at the same time I really wanted to pick Mugging. I had no fixing at that point tough and I really like the Homunculus so I went for that.

**[P2p03](http://i.imgur.com/YIp0e3Z.jpg)**: Again some very late Orzhov goodies here but Simic is a racing deck that doesn't really like Devour Flesh and splashing white is out of the question. I can choose between the Sprite or the Rogue. I was really hurting for 3-drops at that point so I went with the rogue.

**[P2p04](http://i.imgur.com/xKY4sVl.jpg)**: More good Orzhov stuff makes me whish I switched guilds pick 5, but that didn't happen so I can choose between the centaur, the rogue and the illusion since I don't have any synergy with Forced Adaptation yet. I go for the rogue here hoping to grab more bloodrush guys later to feed him and my evolve creatures.

**[P2p05](http://i.imgur.com/EqdR2Ac.jpg)**: Simic Fluxmage or Disciple of the Old Ways are the picks here... Had I went for a Red splash, I think the 2-drop would have been better, but the Fluxmage seemed like a better fit for my deck since evolve on about anything is kind of a big deal. I'm kinda sad this guy isin't a 2/1 instead tough.

**[P2p06](http://i.imgur.com/EkmIWfa.jpg)**: Not much else for me (or anyone else, really...) and bloodrush is insane: Slaughterhorn it is.

**[P2p07](http://i.imgur.com/3F3ZU8c.jpg)**: Drakewing Krasis and it's not even close since I don't have any gates and the flier is an excellent 3-drop.

-------

Not much else for pack 2 except a Greenside Watcher and a Leyline Phantom, but I was expecting to get cut pretty hard so... Eh what can I do? On to pack 3!

-------

**[P3p01](http://i.imgur.com/Pk0MfxY.jpg)**: This is where I really regret not goig Gruul. The red primordial is absolutely brutal in limited. It's a Zealous Conscript on steroids. On the other hand I have 2 really nice cards for my deck here in Simic Charm and Pit Fight. Pit Fight is pretty good removal but the +3/+3 from the charm does this job better in this deck and it's much more flexible. Charm it is, hope I wheel the rogue here.

**[P3p02](http://i.imgur.com/qs2Ge54.jpg)**: Does this pack seem familiar to you? Well see above for explanations. Hope I wheel Agoraphobia or the rogue, even the couterspell would be good now that my creature base look solid.

**[P3p03](http://i.imgur.com/L47Hdsi.jpg)**: Well. I don't know what the guys before me picked, but that pack is certainly LOADED... For Borzhov, that is. I still get to grab a Scab-Clan Charger and hope something tables, but I feel bad nonethless.

**[P3P04](http://i.imgur.com/qEKrOkC.jpg)**: Here the pick is between the 3-drops. I like the Krasis a lot, but he gets killed by anything and I'm low on evolve guys (which are kind of the point of Simic) so I go for the giant fanged frog (I honestly never get tired of the stupid creature types).

**[P3p05](http://i.imgur.com/WiUs9Uu.jpg)**: Second Keymaster Rogue that I'm probably not going to play or... nothing... I almost hate-picked here since some of those tricks are huge blowouts againt my deck but I still went for the rogue after all was said and done.

**[P3p06](http://i.imgur.com/Jb173uY.jpg)**: Some cards are VERY late in this pack. This is the second super-late Devour Flesh and Hands of Binding hand (I know, I'm no LSV) nothing to do here either. I pick the freezing ray because it's excellent in Simic.

**[P3p07](http://i.imgur.com/ckXE19b.jpg)**: Not much for me here. I just hate-pick the removal spell that's wayyyyyy too late again.

**[P3p08](http://i.imgur.com/Br5tveu.jpg)**: As much as I like the shackles for constructed shenanigans, a p8 Friled Oculus is too good to be true!

**[P3p09](http://i.imgur.com/v1tzI6o.jpg)**: Well the Rogue did wheel after all!

**P3p10**: failed to screencap here but the Agoraphobia wheeled too!

**[P3p11](http://i.imgur.com/k0ecKyP.jpg)**: And the Gate!

**[P3p12](http://i.imgur.com/WsYrjZt.jpg)**: And the second Gate!!

**P3P13**: Did you really think I got any other playable after those!?

-------

So I think I ended up with an ok deck but I finished the draft with the impression that I should have splashed red or straight up went Gruul or Orzhov since my first couple of packs probably put 2 other drafters in Simic.

**[This is what the deck ended up looking like](http://i.imgur.com/LcQWVjp.jpg)**

It's got quality 2-drops, plenty of evasion and a lot of tricks to make up for the lack of removal that's a staple in simic decks. On to the matches!

-------

**Match 1: VS Borzhov**

- Game 1: I'm on the play and keep [my 7](http://i.imgur.com/TjFeTEw.jpg). This is kind of the nuts hand of the deck as long as I draw a land so there is really no question in keeping. I go the agressive way and [start the beats early](http://i.imgur.com/MFXiotY.jpg) while my opponent plays taplands and [not much else](http://i.imgur.com/gD4T14L.jpg). I end up miscalculating something and end an attack phase with my opp [on 1 life](http://i.imgur.com/rwiY0Fp.jpg). Thankfully it didn't matter in the end as I have the [answer to his super-blocker on the next turn](http://i.imgur.com/nFs0imE.jpg).

- Game 2: He opts to play and I have to mull to 6 into a pretty shaky hand, but it's got [removal and a late-game plan](http://i.imgur.com/8lFoWu8.jpg) so I keep. Hopefully I draw into some nice 2-3-drops. Turns out he has a pretty good hand and I walk right into his Executionner's Swing with my Binding Crockaruna on [turn 4](http://i.imgur.com/Iw8SxMb.jpg), which cost me the game as his board presence is [much stronger than mine](http://i.imgur.com/ieBVCig.jpg).

- Game 3: I keep [my 7](http://i.imgur.com/3ZF4SwM.jpg) even tough it lacks a 2-drop and a Forest because it's got my Raptor and a Charm. Things are pretty slow and the second spell I cast is a Mystic Genesis on his Syndicate Enforcer, netting me a [nice 4/4 token](http://i.imgur.com/rJ7vFJX.jpg). Game goes on and I manage to [bind his team](http://i.imgur.com/hFbhczp.jpg) and Swing in for the win [a turn later](http://i.imgur.com/E8apmpi.jpg).

-------

**Match 2: VS Borzhov, the Return!**

- Game 1: He's on the play and I keep my 7 since it has [all that I need](http://i.imgur.com/rOW2ab9.jpg). We play our creatures and I eventually bait him into blocking my petty fliers with his assault griffin but he's smarter than that and [takes the hit](http://i.imgur.com/YLI79oY.jpg). I think this was a misplay as I should have swung with only the 3/1 to propose the trade. Attacking with the Raptor kind of gave the plan away and was not worth it because I really needed to kill the flier. Anyway I Play a Keymaster Rogue, getting my Drakewing Krasis back and we trade blows until I put a [Hands of Binding on my Raptor](http://i.imgur.com/VGyvDst.jpg) and tap him out untill I win.

- Game 2: He plays and I keep [my 7](http://i.imgur.com/z27Sgfh.jpg) which is a bit on the slow end but has great potential if I draw almost anything (sorry for the ""you win"" panel, it was bugged there until i restarted MTGO a bit later in the match). He starts pretty quickly with a Madcap Skills on top of his Gutter Skulk While I play a [couple of dudes of my own](http://i.imgur.com/uurq7sJ.jpg). He's smart tough and doesn't attack into my double blockers. Since I really dont want to go into the late-game against his deck I decide to swing with my Oculus keeping Charm mana up to [bounce his enchanted rat](http://i.imgur.com/wzL8y8b.jpg). That stops his agressive start and lets me put the pressure on a bit, but lo and behold, he drops Assemble the Legion and enough blockers to [slow me down](http://i.imgur.com/NDLpEvA.jpg). I'm on my way to winning in the air regardless when he plays a Martial Glory on his Griffin to block my 4/4 Nimbus Swimmer and I make the tragic mistake of forgetting to bloodrush my Scab-Clan Charger to [save him and kill the bird](http://i.imgur.com/OIWKL9I.jpg)... Fuck me, right? He then killed my Deathcult Rogue and chump-blocked into victory with Assemble the Legion. Well that was bad, I guess the stress of being low on time due to all the screencapping did play a role. Let's try to win game 3 in under 6 minutes, shall we?

- Game 3: Or we could just [get stomped](http://i.imgur.com/oq4AgsP.jpg).

-------

Since this was 4-3-2-2, I get eliminated and take my 2 packs, but I'm kinda bummed I didnt get into the finals. I guess I won't forget to bloodrush again.

So, That's about it for my first report, hope you guys enjoyed it!

Until next time, may the shuffler gods be with you!

1359374676.0,29,self.spikes,17fb2w,[Standard] RDW Post-Gatecrash discussion,33,4,56,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/17fb2w/standard_rdw_postgatecrash_discussion/,"There is, in my opinion, two competitive forms of RDW; Dirty Red and Big Red (which I call Clifford).

Dirty Red is lots of low-costing creatures, with the top of the curve being Hellrider and then lots of burn to finish off the game.

Clifford is with a higher curve, finishing with Thundermaw Hellkite, and cutting burn spells to fit him (and the extra lands) in.

Looking at the red spells from gatecrash, here are my personal opinions on cards that could be considered:


1 Mana:


[Legion Loyalist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=366348): He's definitely not a 1 drop. Obviously, if I've mulligan'd down to 5, and he's my only option at a turn 1 play, I would play him, but at the moment, I would play [Stromkirk Noble](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=230783) &gt; [Rakdos Cackler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=253596) &gt; [Stonewright](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=239975)/[Legion Loyalist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=366348) (depending on opening hand mana).
That being said, I wouldn't mind dropping this + another 2 drop on turn 3, and activating the first strike + trample ability straight away. However, considering your 1 and 2 drops don't usually have enough power to make the trample relevant... I don't know. I honestly just think I don't have room for him. What if they have spot removal? He's then just a 1/1 with haste, which is 1 damage at best.
Do I want to play Worldfire, and then hope for mountain, legion loyalist? That's the Johnny in me speaking.


2 Mana:


[Burning Tree Emissary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=366467): Yes, paired with [Lightning Mauler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=271119) turn 2, and you're swinging for 6 is amazing, but that feels like magical christmas land. [Ash Zealot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=253623) is your primary 2 drop, which you can't cast after Burning Tree, and I've honestly been underwhelmed by Lightning Mauler's presence in my RDW.


[Skullcrack](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=366238): Think how many times you use Searing Spear to your opponents face during a match. I would probably then cut those, and run that many of Skullcrack. I see many people saying this is anti-Thragtusk. If your opponent has farseek'd, they can play him on turn 4. Why do you have 2 open mana up on turn 4 if you have a Hellrider in hand? RDW already creams decks that run Sphinx's Revelation, it doesn't need a win more card.


3 mana:

[Arrows of Justice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=366381): It's an answer to have if they have a Restoration Angel, or some other blocker. 4 damage is pretty significant in this format. I might sideboard this, but honestly, I prefer to just sideboard in Traitorous Blood and steal their blocker instead.

[Boros Reckoner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=366385): Probably the best addition to RDW. The 3 R cost isn't too harsh, since you should only be running up to 2 colourless lands (Hellion Crucibles) Is awesome value for similar reasons to Hellrider. If he swings, he's going to either get chump blocked, and deal 1 or 2 damage, or if they wish to trade with him, that's minimum 3 damage to their face (or another creature!?). That's like a free searing spear on a 3/3 for 3. The first strike ability is just gravy.
Another point is that if they're a very aggro deck, drop this guy down. They won't want to swing in to hit him (like a stuffy doll for 2 less mana!)


4 mana:


[Rubblebelt Raiders](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=366462): Hard to justify swapping out Hellrider for this. I feel like this card needs haste to be worth it.

If it untaps, it's going to be turn 5. They should definitely have a blocker out by then, which it doesn't get around. Though it can trade up, usually. Or they may have cleared your board, in which case it only receives one +1/+1 counter. Needs more testing.


[Scorchwalker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=366409): This card should honestly just be in the 3 mana slot. He's 5 damage for 1RR, which is better than the conditional morbid trigger of Brimstone Volley for 2R. I would consider running 2 of him to pump on one of your unblocked creatures, to get a surprising 5 more damage in. At worst, he's a 5/1 for 4, which is simply put: Will trade with (mostly) anything that blocks it.


[Viashino Shanktail](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=366264): A 3/1 first strike for 4 doesn't seem as good as a 5/1 for 4. Also, 2R for +3/+1 First Strike doesn't seem as good as 1RR for +5/+1. More of a limited card, I think.


5 mana:


[Wrecking Ogre] (http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=366446): This card won me most of my games at pre-release. The 5 mana cost is intensive, but +3/+3 double strike on an unblocked dude is scary. 3/3 Double Strike man for 5 is definitely not worth cutting Thundermaw Hellkites from your deck though. MAYBE a Clifford card, but I honestly can't see this filling any slots.



So /r/Spikes, what do you think? What are your thoughts on mono red decks post-gatecrash?

Is this something other people would find useful? If so I'd be interested in having a few other folks see if it works for them as well. 

I've only tested it using my own data so far - so I'm not sure if it will hit formatting snags with people who have lots of years of event history.

As has been suggested, commented, and approved by the moderator team, we are trying to condense our competitive budget discussion into one place on a weekly basis.  
  
This is the place where we discuss budget-conscious spikes and their needs for competitive magic.  Maybe it's a card consideration given an X dollar budget.  Maybe it's discussing current tier-1 decks under X dollars.  Maybe you need that sweet cheap tech that no one else thought of?  The ideas are only limited by the greenbacks in your wallet!  
  
With that, feel free to discuss most anything budget-related here.  Myself and the mod team will only be removing posts that are an obvious ""I am unwilling to replace a necessary $&lt;High Value&gt; card in an established deck; make it cheaper"" sort of plea.  Otherwise, have at it!

I'm sure blitz decks will still be a large part of the format too. So it seems to me, if everyone is going to be trying new brews and is going away from traditional G/B midrange/control lists, that a hard control deck centered around boardwipes and card advantage could be very strong. 

What has me the most excited are two fantastic additions to the arsenal for this type of deck: [Mutavault](http://media.wizards.com/images/magic/tcg/products/m14/poi798sjkasd/1xOmpOoB7N_EN.jpg) and [Haunted Plate Mail](http://media.wizards.com/images/magic/tcg/products/m14/poi798sjkasd/uxu3Lcg9tL_EN.jpg). They both give the deck actual ways to win alongside of boardwipes, which previously was only possible through either Aetherling or Planeswalkers (or Assemble the Legion and burning people out in U/W/R decks). With Plate Mail and Mutavault thrown into the mix, there is finally a consistent way to win games in a U/W control deck without having to look to a third color and without having to rely on Aetherling. EDIT: And somehow I forgot to mention Nephalia Drownyard. That works too, it just requires a third color and is much slower.

Another unexpected addition to this deck is the reprint of [Quicken](http://media.wizards.com/images/magic/tcg/products/m14/poi798sjkasd/FkPjIQNnfY_EN.jpg). Slamming a Supreme Verdict on their turn is fantastic (source: Alchemist's Refuge in early Bant Control variants). This one is a 'free' card, and even has the potential upside of miracle-ing Terminus. Definitely a fantastic card to add to the deck.

That said, here is the 75 that I am starting with. Very much a rough draft but it is something to go off of at least:

&gt;1 Aetherling

&gt;2 Augur of Bolas

&gt;2 Haunted Plate Mail

&gt;4 Supreme Verdict

1372861786.0,29,self.spikes,1hkgv0,[Modern] Zombie-Vine,33,4,57,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/1hkgv0/modern_zombievine/,"UPDATE: New list, now 3-1 in 3 straight dailies. We were really close to a 4-0 but mulliganed to 4 in game 3 against scapeshift. http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/modern-zombie-vine/

I'm posting it here for two reasons--so that those going to KC for the GP will know that it exists, and also to get some feedback. Like I said, I think this deck is very close, but not quite there.

This deck is fast enough to race combo and resilient enough to stick around in the more grindy matchups. It has trouble against decks that flood the board with small creatures that can chump over and over again, and then either swing back in force or fly over in the air for the win. The worst two match-ups are soul sisters and BW Tokens. Storm can also be rough, but the new board configuration (4 x Rakdos Charm) should help. 

For those of you who are not familiar, this deck aims to dump Vengevine and other goodies in the graveyard, and resurrect them as quickly as possible. Lotleth Troll is a huge threat in this deck, as re-buying dredgers and discarding them to him every turn adds up quickly. Everythign you're pitching into your GY you want there anyway, so you aren't always risking anything by going ""all in"" on a Troll. He is, however, susceptible to Path to Exile and Terminate. 

In the board, the Abrupt Decays are for Twin and anything running 4 x Tarmogoyf. Ancient Grudge is for Pod, Affinity, and Wurmcoil Engine, and has the added bonus of being used off of a dredge. Gnaw to the Bone is bonkers against Burn in this deck, as it can be cast twice or used off of a dredge, and often gains 8+ life. Lavamancer comes in in several matchups--whenever creatures with 1 or 2 toughness are important. Rakdos Charm is the best answer I've found to storm, as it fights both of their game plans. It can exile the GY when they cast Past in Flames, or it can kill them if they empty the Warrens. It also comes in against Twin, and 1 or 2 will come in to augment the Grudges against Wurmcoil Decks.

Glaring omissions from the Deck are Tarmogoyf and Demigod of Revenge. Goyf would be an excellent beater, but Putrid Leech gets the nod because he is a Zombie, and lets us re-buy Gravecrawlers to trigger Vengevine. Demigod is too expensive for this build. 5 Mana is a lot--we want to hit hard in the early turns and only run 20 lands. 

I very much want to squeeze Blood Artist into this deck, but just can't find the room. In a lot of match-ups, you are running your wave of smaller creatures into bigger ones to force through damage, and then bringing them back and doing it again the next turn. Blood Artist fits perfectly into this plan, but we don't run a sac outlet and he doesn't do much on his own. I have also considered Blasting Station. 

Any feedback is much appreciated. Thanks. ",,False,,t5_2utkz,1372990579.0,,,True,t3_1hkgv0,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/1hkgv0/modern_zombievine/,

1353832049.0,31,self.spikes,13r51u,[Standard] TCGPlayer 5K Worcester Tournament Report: GW Aggro (a la Kibler),34,3,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/13r51u/standard_tcgplayer_5k_worcester_tournament_report/,"Hello r/spikes! I just got home from the TCGPlayer 5K in Worcester, and decided I'd write up a tournament report about my experience.

[This is the deck I played.](http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/gw-aggromidrange/) Some points about card choices:

- I didn't play any copies of Yeva, which is something that differs from Kibler's list. Frankly, they were always much worse of a draw than the Wolfir Avenger, so I replaced the 2 Yeva with 2 more copies of Wolfir Avenger, putting it up to 3. I wish I had run 4.

- I ran 4 Thragtusks in the 75. This wasn't really where I wanted to be, since I never really wanted to board out my Silverhearts and jamming more 5-drops in my deck really made the board slots feel clumsy. Unfortunately, I was unable to get my hands on 2 Centaur Healers. Yes, I know it's a common. I wanted 2 of those in place of 2 of the Thragtusks, since it comes down earlier against the super aggressive matchups. Thankfully I only had to play one Zombies matchup.

- An extra Faith's Shield in the side. That card is really good, and I ended up boarding the third copy in almost every single time. I really wish I had maxed out on them in the 75, since many of the times it was a blowout when I cast it or even won me the game straight out.

- In his most recent article about this deck, Brian Kibler said he felt like  Silverblade Paladin was unimpressive in the deck, and he was right. I found this out in testing and went to 2 copies, and here's my reasoning. You usually won't have anything ridiculous to pair it with right when he hits, since your earlier drops are 1/1's and Thalia. He spent a good deal of time just sitting around this tournament, and while he occasionally made a Loxodon Smiter much scarier, there were very few times he truly shined. I boarded him out almost every match.

- I feel like the mana in this deck is really good, and with fewer copies of Silverblade Paladin drawing white sources will be less necessary. That said, I want to switch out a Plains for a Cavern after this tournament.

Now for the event.

**Round 1 - UW Flash (0-2)**

I kept a speculative opener: 5 lands, Arbor Elf, Thragtusk on the draw. I don't really know what I was thinking, since by the time I could start casting spells my opponent could counter them all. Unfortunately, none of the cards I drew were uncounterable, had flash, caused their spells to cost 1 more to cast, or did anything relevant. So I lost that one fairly decisively. Game 2 I boarded in both Garruk Relentless and Triumph of Ferocity, as well as the third Faith's Shield. After casting Garruk, he cast Restoration Angel and swung to kill it. I let him die, but realized I could have saved him with Faith's Shield to make another Wolf token. I got him to 6 before he stabilized with just the single Wolf I had, so it's likely the second would have been lethal.

**Current Record: 0-1**

**Round 2 - UW Humans (0-2)**

He won the die roll, and proceeded to curve Champion of the Parish into Knight of Glory into Silverblade Paladin into Sublime Archangel both games. The round was over before I knew what hit me.

So there I am, two rounds in and already on the line to not make prizes. I had always dropped in other large tournaments after such a start, but this time I resolved to push through for experience and try to get the best record I could.

**Current Record: 0-2**

**Round 3 - 4-Color Reanimator [Junk splash Red] (2-0)**

This round was actually against someone from my local shop. He had played another local in Round 1 and lost as well. Game 1, he played no spells until turn 5. I had him at 3 life, and his first spell was Thragtusk. And then Unburial Rites hardcast on Thragtusk after I managed to kill it. And then another Thragtusk. And then another Thragtusk. And then, ladies and gentlemen, he dropped the final Thragtusk, for a total of 5 consecutive turns of Thragtusk. Luckily, games 2 and 3 went much smoother with the 3 Rest In Peace out of the sideboard. At one point I cast Faith's Shield to save Wolfir Silverheart from a hardcast Angel of Serenity, which allowed me to take over the game.

**Current Record: 1-2**

**Round 4 - UW Flash (2-1)**

This guy got paired down, and you can trust he let me know it. He was very frustrated and frequently rude. He got snitty if I was a stickler for the rules, and gloated when he took down game 2 with a Talrand. I sided all 3 copies of Rest In Peace for game 2, but removed them for game 3. I figured he had probably boarded out his Runechanter's Pikes and Snapcaster Mages, which means that I could throw in more value cards in their place. How will he know I'm siding them out? If he's siding out like they're already in play, they've done their job without having to be in the mainboard. Since the deck I played is designed with UW Flash in mind, the matchup was very much in my favor most of the way through. I made a misplay at the end of the 3rd game, but it didn't cost me anything because he didn't have the Unsummon.

**Current Record: 2-2**

**Round 5 - UW Flash (2-0)**

This match was against Anthony Hoyhn(sp?). If anybody knows who I'm talking about and can correct me please do so.

I started this match off by asking him if I could call him Tony. I was unaware that apparently he's a fairly prominent player that has attended the Pro Tour, I believe on multiple occasions. He had some sort of PT stamp on his cards, I don't know much about it.

The game went very much my way, as it should against UW Flash. Thalia was extremely oppressive against him, and I slammed her turn 2 both games. Augur of Bolas slowed her assault well enough, but a couple Faith's Shields to blank his Azorius Charms and Unsummons allowed my larger creatures to grind it out in game 1. In game 2 I probably invested too much to the board before the Supreme Verdict, but I drew Nevermore naming Supreme Verdict the next turn. The second one he was holding rotted in his hand all game as he was forced to use his Detention Spheres on my Thalia in order to be able to cast enough spells to not die. He cast a Rhox Faithmender, and also had a Runechanter's Pike, but my early Rest In Peace just meant the small amount of damage he would negate would make the game longer for him than it had to be. He never drew a Sphinx's Revelation.

**Current Record: 3-2**

**Round 6 - Jund Midrange**

I feel like this was one of my poor matchups. It's harder for a creature deck to go bigger than Olivia, and with only 5 cards that can possibly answer her in my 75 (3 Selesnya Charm and 2 Nevermore) it was really just a matter of whether or not she hit the table. In game 1, he flooded out on mana while I drew Thragtusk and some Restoration Angels, and while his Huntmaster flipping back and forth almost killed me, blinking Thragtusk got me there. In game 2, I was unable to stick any reasonable threat, and had to play defense until he just killed me. Game 3, he dropped the hammer on me. He put on enough early pressure that I needed to play my Restoration Angel before my Thragtusk, and then slammed Olivia. First he stole Restoration Angel, and then he stole Thragtusk. If that wasn't bad enough, he used Rakdos's Return to discard my hand. I cast the Wolfir Avenger but lost my other cards, so all I had was a pair of 3/3's against a wall of my own creatures. He's threatening lethal next turn and I have no hand, so I look him in the eyes and say ""there's only one card in my deck that wins me this game."" I lift the card and see one of my 3 Selesnya Charms, exile his Olivia, and swing for lethal with the creatures I got back.

**Current Record: 4-2**

**Round 7 - Junk Midrange**

His deck seemed basically like it was Junk Goodstuff. Deathrite Shaman, Thragtusk, Restoration Angel, Farseek, you name it. Unfortunately, he didn't really give himself any of the ridiculous card advantage engines like Grisly Salvage or Unburial Rites (that I saw), so his draws fell short. In game 1 he was very mana light, losing with only 4 in play, although he had a mana guy and still cast quite a lot of spells. Eventually I took it by swinging with 2 Restoration Angels with him at 5, and when he only blocked one dropped a third Restoration Angel to blink Wolfir Silverheart and soulbond with the one he didn't block. Game 2 was even uglier, as he had to mulligan to 4 cards. I took over the game with an Ulvenwald Tracker fairly quickly, and Lingering Souls can only hold off a Wolfir Silverheart bonded with Restoration Angel for so many turns.

**Current Record 5-2**

**Round 8 - BR Zombies**

Without Centaur Healers in the board, I dreaded this matchup. In fact, I had no reasonable reason I should have won it. In game 1 I dropped more fatties than he did, and Restoration Angel bonded with a Wolfir Silverheart ends games very quickly. Game 2 he came blazing out the gates, absolutely smashing me. 4 Thragtusks did me no good when I couldn't live long enough to cast them. Game 3 he mulliganed to 5, then got stuck on lands. He had a Mountain and a Rakdos Guildgate in play with 3 Hellriders in hand. If he had drawn into the lands he needed that would've been it for me. It wasn't pretty, but it was a win.

**Current Record: 6-2**

**Round 9 - Naya Midrange**

At this point, I've been on a crazy high from being so close to elimination and then winning six consecutive games. I did the math, and after fumbling with the numbers for a while, found out that if I won my last match I would be able to make Top 32! When rounds were posted, I saw that I was paired up with yet another player from my LGS. I was exactly one point and one tier in the standings ahead of him, so we were both in contention for prizes and the finish. It looked like I was going the full 9 rounds. We shook hands, wished each other good luck, and got to playing.

Game 1 he was able to drop a Huntmaster on turn 3, and I was casting a lot of creatures in order to prevent the guy from flipping. Huntmaster was very problematic for me against Jund, but when Angel of Serenity came down I realized that a flipping Werewolf was the least of my worries. 0-1

Game 2 saw me on the play, and this time I was able to apply all the pressure. Faith's Shield (which had overperformed all day) prevented his burn from killing my guys at important points, and Selesnya Charm allowed my Arbor Elf to trade with his Garruk Relentless. I tanked for a couple minutes as to whether or not he had the Selesnya Charm for himself, but ended up risking it anyway and played out the Wolfir Silverheart. He didn't have an answer, and while he was able to drop a Huntmaster to get back up to 14, Restoration Angel paired with the big bad wolf is still a two-turn clock. 1-1

Game 3, and my heart's racing. Everything rested on this game. I had just played on the razor's edge for at least 6 hours, always one dropped match away from having nothing to show. Unfortunately, it was fairly uneventful. While there was a Bonfire of the Damned for 1 to wipe my mana guys, I used Faith's Shield to save one and still have enough to cast a Restoration Angel the next turn. I kept drawing Wolfir Avengers and Restoration Angels to blink in, and when he finally dropped his Thundermaw Hellkite, I had the Selesnya Charm to stop it before it hit me. With regeneration and 4 toughness making his burn next to useless, my creatures quickly overwhelmed him. 2-1

**Final Record: 7-2**

After everything, I won ***seven consecutive rounds,*** ended up in 22nd place, and 4 other players from my local shop (of which there were only 8) ended up making prizes. One of them, a 14 year-old who has been playing for less than 6 months, went 7-0-2 in his second major tournament, and ended up in the top 8! While he ended up busting in the quarterfinals, he still earned lots of respect and bragging rights.

1376156748.0,26,self.spikes,1k3jvk,Is The Rock (Junk Midrange) viable in Modern?,42,16,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/1k3jvk/is_the_rock_junk_midrange_viable_in_modern/,"Is The Rock (Junk Midrange) viable in Modern? Lets discuss.

My decklist relevant to my discussion of the Junk Midrange Archetype following this link:

[The Rock /Junk Midrange](http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/the-rock-17-06-13-1/)

After the banning of Bloodbraid Elf I have found Jund to be much less aggressive in modern regardless of how you switch up the deck and try to fill the void that Bloodbraid has left. I then looked to Ajani Jund that 'splashes' white for Ajani Vengeant, Path to Exile and Lingering Souls mainly. However this is more than just a light splash and the manabase is quite greedy. Unable to apply the same tight pressure consistently as Jund could with Bloodbraid Elf rounding out the deck, I looked to refine the deck to a slower pace with a wider range of answers and a solid late game along the same low curve with cards that are relevant in both the early and late game. I then cut out red from the deck to play GBW with a BGx Midrange Core with white to fill in the spaces with cards relevant to the early and late game as well as very powerful sideboard options very relevant to the current competitive meta (Aven Mindcensor, Linvala Keeper of Silence and possibly Stony Silence). The deck shares a lot of card choices with Jund, but plays a bit differently. It trades lightning Bolts for Path to Exile sacrificing aggression for early to late game versatility playing better against Wurmcoil Engine, Goyf, Finks, etc. Lingering Souls is a very synergistic card for the deck and helps cover a weak point against fliers. For the next card choice, there is still a lot of argument about what card deserves the spot (Voice, Smiter, Scavenging Ooze), but I think Knight of the Reliquary fills this role the best. Knight of the Reliquary alongside a land toolbox of 2 Ghost Quarter (Or Tec-Edge, less tricks plus minimum of 4 land restriction), Vault of the Archangel and possibly Gavony Township (Currently testing to see if its worth running as a 4th colorless land, the argument for it is the ability to end the game faster as opposed to Vault's purpose of pseudo removal/stabilization). I play 16 Black sources, 15 Green sources and 15 White sources (Counting Fetches as able to become any of the 3 colors, I play 10).

I will now address what playing GBW means in the current competitive meta. 

Jund - Playing against Jund we are less aggressive, but our removal is live against all of their creatures other than abrupt decay (Which can kill a flipped Huntmaster if they play him) which only hits most of their creatures and their Liliana. Having Knight and Goyf which often cannot simply be bolted off the table (It also takes 2 DRS to hold Knight down during which they are not activating DRS for G or B if we use Knight to search up a fetch which we then crack to put 2 total lands into our graveyard also thinning the deck of lands which makes a bigger difference the longer the game goes on. Lingering Souls is quite potent against them especially with Vault or Gavony and generally demands a maesltrom pulse or intense aggro from them to be answered. Stirring Wildwood is rather irrelevant here and I have cut to 1 now anyways (cut my 2nd to tryout Gavony Township), we have Paths and Ghost Quarters to deal with their raging ravines.

Affinity - Ghost Quarter helps against Inkmoth and Blinkmoth, Path is more effective than bolt against Ravager shenanigans, Knight can find Vault and stabilize against them as well as Lingering Souls helping out here as well.

RDW, Gruul Aggro, Domain Zoo, etc - Game one can be difficult despite the help from Path, Knight and souls, but the deck can handle extremely aggressive strategies quite well game two and three siding out Bob and Thoughtseize and bring in Scavenging Ooze and other relevant cards, Linvala is not bad as simply a 3/4 Flier when Bob is coming out anyways, etc.

Hatebears - White really gives the deck a fighting chance against a sea of big and or disruptive creatures as path can take care of liege, voice where other removal fails. Vault is very relevant 'if' it stays on the board depeding on their build.

Merfolk - Path hits lords often when lightning bolt cannot, Knight and Vault and lingering souls are very strong against merfolk.

Tron - Ghost Quarter (Great with sideboarded Life from the Loam), Path to Exile on Wurmcoil Engine and friends, Knight of the Reliquary, Lingering Souls can buy turns against big stuff, Scavenging Ooze in from the side helps stop Mindslaver lock, Thoughtseize is also effective here and Liliana of the Veil eats up their resources and pushes the game in our favor.

UWx Midrange/Control - Path to Exile/Ghost Quarter for Celestial Collonade, Goyf + Knight outnumbers their path to exile and supreme verdict especially when we have Deathrite Shaman for their Snapcaster Mage, Thoughtseize for their best removal or Ajani Vengeant or Sphinx Revelation, Liliana of the Veil is amazing in this matchup as she is very hard for them to kill, she eats up their resources that allow them to live and removes lone Geist of Saint Traft.

Gifts - They're more effective game 1 than UWx Control, but game 2 and 3 we have 4 Deathrite Shaman, up to 3 Scavenging Ooze and up to 3 Aven Mindcensor that help mess up their game plan, the same kinds of cards are good against Gifts as UWx Control, except Gifts Ungiven gives them an edge unless we hate it out, preferably with a timely thoughtseize.

Soul Sisters/ Martyr Life - Path to Exile helps remove buffed Serra Asendant's and Vault of the Archangel helps race against their life gain while removing their dudes, if they play land destruction, bringing in Life from the Loam can help here. Scavenging Ooze is potentially worth siding in, I haven't played this matchup this much and I think Soul Sister isn't that competitive despite putting up 'some' results.

Faeries - Knight provides a way to stabilize with vault or township and also snowballs into a huge threat they will have serious trouble dealing with. Liliana of the Veil is very nice for applying pressure. Many of our cards are effective here, it is a matter of playing your weakest threats into untapped mana and your strongest threats when there is an opening or they're out of gas.

Birthing Pod - Our removal is good vs both combo pods, Melira and Kiki-Pod, outside of township, our one toughness dudes are vulnerable to Orzhov Pontiff and Izzet Staticaster, Knight is big, ghost quarter for their township, vault to grind them out. Thoughtseize is very nice for removing Pod from their hand among many of their threats and silver bullets. Aven Mindcensor, Linvala Keeper of Silence come in also with Scavenging Ooze and help out, bringing out Lingering Souls and Bob.

Splinter Twin - Instant Removal is huge in this matchup especially being able to kill the Exarch with 4 toughness. Liliana of the Veil is a critical blow to them as you force them to combo into your removal without protection as you eat their resources. Thoughtseize is very nice being able to take away critical combo pieces from their hand. Abrupt Decay is Lethal to their game plan. Linvala can come in to help ensure victory.

Scapeshift - Thoughtseize for Scaleshift is huge. Albeit difficult, we can try to outrace them with Vault of the Archangel that also helps deal with Primeval Titan where path to exile also triumphs. Ghost quarter does nothing here despite some peoples' misunderstanding of how triggers work. Bringing Aven Mindcensor is big but should be used like a shadow of doubt and not a creature due to their wipes.

Living End - Knight gets big when they blow up our lands and we are not devastated by their land destruction, deathrite shaman helps slow them down, removal can be important trying to fight off a live hoard. Liliana of the Veil is fine here as an outlet to dump our own creatures before Living End goes off as a symmetrical effect. Thoughtseize is tricky and might be best used on ourself if we can dump a Knight in our yard. Siding, Life from the Loam can be nice to dredge dudes and keep lands on the table and Scavenging Ooze is very nice for devouring their yard.

Instant Reanimator - Deathrite Shaman is huge if they do not win by the time he is active and he must be removed by them. Thoughtseize is very nice to remove their reanimation spell. Path to Exile can help somewhat against Griselbrand, but ultimately only buys us a turn to deal with their graveyard. Bringing in Scavenging Ooze is punishing for them and forces them to win early or lose unless they have enough removal and the pieces of the combo also to back it up. Despite not having many strong fast answers to their deck they lack the consistency of Legacy Reanimation decks such as Tin Fins (Awful Name btw), one thoughtseize could ruin them for quite a few turns while we try to kill them as fast as possible and try to get our graveyard hate online.

UR Storm - Storm is weaker now relying a lot on Pyromancer's ascension which we can blow up, Goblin Electromancer who we can easily kill and Past in Flames which we can counteract with Deathrite Shaman. Thoughtseize also helps a lot in taking their most crucial combo piece from their hand. Liliana of the Veil is superb as she eats up their resources and greatly reduces their chances of winning. Maelstrom Pulsr deals with goblins quite well.

1374659570.0,27,self.spikes,1iy42b,[Standard] Blindsided by a Maze's End deck in an MTGO 8-man,33,6,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/1iy42b/standard_blindsided_by_a_mazes_end_deck_in_an/,"I'm new to /r/spikes and I hope this is the right place to talk MTGO tournament metagame.

I've run into two Maze's End decks in the last couple of days playing Standard 8-mans. The first one was fairly weak, it had tons of sacrificing effects and sweepers to keep the board clean until he could Maze's End for the win. I won that match 2-1 thanks to the 2 Pithing Needles in the sideboard. The second one I faced in the finals and he won 2-0. I was running Naya Midrange with Kessig Wolf Run and the Maze's End deck could cast a Fog-like effect or a sweeper every single turn for 7 or 8 turns straight, which is all the time he needs to find 10 Gates and Maze's End.

I can't find a Maze's End decklist in the Decks of the Week archive, so I'll list the cards I saw regularly and how many I think he was running (unfortunately the game didn't get archived so I'm doing this from memory):

4 Fog

3 Druid's Deliverance

3 Riot Control

4 Urban Evolution

4 Terminus

2 or 3 Supreme Verdict

1 or 2 Cyclonic Rift

2 Detention Sphere

4 Saruli Gatekeepers

2 or 3 Sphinx's Revelation

1 or 2 Ral Zarek

(at least) 2 Maze's End

After sideboarding, I got both Pithing Needles but he put each one in a Detention Sphere, and I couldn't hit either of my 2 Ray of Revelations to return a Needle to play. I had Kessig Wolf Run and attacked for almost-lethal every turn, but every turn he just played another Fog. He didn't care how many elemental tokens my Voice of Resurgence made, they would be getting Fogged every turn anyway until a Terminus swept them all under the rug.

The Ral Zarek is a nice touch to untap a Maze's End on the first turn it's in play and activate it for the win.

What are some ways for creature midrange decks to handle this archetype? Is UWR Flash in a better position against this deck? Once Mutavaults come to MTGO Standard, is it a good idea for midrange to run 2-3 Ghost Quarters in the sideboard?

So I've been pushing UWR as a deck multiple times on this subreddit for the past few weeks and some people have opposing views that UW anything isn't going to be good in this format. I think that assumption is wrong and UWR has had plenty of top spots in Daily's, Premiers, SCG Opens. I think UWR is in a great spot in the current meta as it has an answer to a lot of things. I've noticed the creature base is a constant changing thing in current UWR decks some utilize Aetherling and some play with Reckoner or Aurelia like pre-DGM but there have been others such as a mix of Aurelia and Reckoner that have peeked my interest. Also the most recent SCG Open UWR control took 1st and I was wondering where this deck could go. So let me break down what I have in mind for UWR as a deck.

**The Decks**

[UWR Control-SCG Open](http://sales.starcitygames.com//deckdatabase/displaydeck.php?DeckID=56106)

I really like this deck, I think the card choices are great but the list could use a little refineing to get it where it needs to be. It obviously placed very well and [another person decided to run it on Sunday](http://sales.starcitygames.com//deckdatabase/displaydeck.php?DeckID=56135) I like more snapcaster's in the board.

[Aetherling UWR](http://www.mtgtop8.com/event?e=5004&amp;d=228864)

it's a simmilar list to previous Aurelia decks but using Aetherling as win con instead. I think Aetherling is a great finisher and so is Aurelia but Aetherling is a lot more difficult to deal with.

[Aurelia UWR](http://www.mtgtop8.com/event?e=4993&amp;d=228798)

With new additions such as Turn, Warleader's Helix, and Renounce The Guilds the deck got a lot more cards to deal with the problems it was having before. 

[Reckoner UWR](http://www.mtgtop8.com/event?e=5008&amp;d=228896)

See above. Also the name of this deck is interesting.

[Mixed UWR](http://www.mtgtop8.com/event?e=4961&amp;d=228636)

Decks like this have been popping up on MTGO daily's and Premiers and I like the idea of running Reckoner along side Aurelia. You don't have to use the Combos with reckoner but you can use him as a stone wall against aggro and when the game is in your favor swing in favorably. There have been more list but I can't find the most recent ones on MTGTOP8. [2](http://www.mtgtop8.com/event?e=4932&amp;d=228477)

**Card Choices**

*Creatures*

* Geist of Saint Traft - A power house in Tempo and some UWR midrange decks recently have used him along side Reckoner. I think he isn't very good here but I'd like to be proven wrong

* Thundermaw Hellkite - A strong finisher and can be curved into with a midrange deck that uses Geist.

* Aurelia - An already dominant role player in UWR that can end games when she is put on the battlefield.

* Aetherling - A hard to remove finisher that can kill in two turns if they are at 16 life or below.

* Reckoner - A Big role player in the beginnings of UWR in GTC with combo cards like Harvest Pyre and Blasphemous Act. 

* Snapcaster - Obvious inclusion in any UW deck.

* Restoration Angel - See above.

* Augur of Bolas - Serves as a great 2 drop that can find spells and block aggro fairly well.

* Deputy of acquittals - Recurring Snapcasters/Restoration Angel for Max value and also saves Win cons from Board wipes.

* Izzet Staticaster -  Great against mana dorks, Tokens and x/1 creatures.

*Burn*

* Warleader's Helix - a 4 Mana Lightning Helix + 1 is seen as slow compared to the original but still is very useful at instant speed. Can bluff Resto with this up as well.

* Turn / Burn - What the Blue Red decks needed to help against Big green Fatties and other problem creatures.

* Searing Spear - 2 Mana Lightning bolt has been a pillar of format and can deal with a lot of creatures

* Pillar of Flame - Voice of Resurgence

*Counters*

* Counterflux - Uncounterable counterspell is really good but overshadowed by Dissipate and it's exile clause
 
* Rendersilent - Counterspell with Silence tacked on can stop a lot of decks.

* Rewind - At 4 mana can counter a spell untap either Resto or Helix with the mana after.

* Dissipate -  Counterspell and Exile the card instead works great against reanimator.

* Negate/Dispel - Work great in the Sideboard

* Syncopate - Good counterspell for X mana and exile clause.

*Card Draw*

* Thought Scour - Filter through deck and making Snapcaster more Potent at 1 mana

* Think Twice - Draw and Flashback Draw

* Azorius Charm - 3 Modes are all good and Cycling it is the most common of the three

* Sphinx's Revelation -  Staple of the Archetype for a reason.

*Others*
 
* Assemble the Leigon - Can get out of hand and just pumps out to many creatures to deal with. 

* Detention Sphere - Can lock away any permanent(s)

* Tamiyo - Great planeswalker that can hurt when opponent is stumbling on mana.

* Ral Zarek - Mana accelerator, and Burn. Not as good as Ajani Vengeant but I think he can fit well in a burn strategy deck.

* Jace, AOT - Fact or Fiction is good and making Aggro a little less powerful can swing the game in favor.

* Jace Memory Adept - Card Draw and Mill great sideboard

* Renounce the Guilds - Removal that can deal with Multicolored permanents.

* Supreme Verdict - Board wipe that can't be countered 

* Terminus - Board wipe that can be miracled and hard to play around. 

* Clone - Great in the side, Copy big green fatties move on.

**Thoughts**

I think UWR is a fairly powerful archetype to begin with and I think it is hear to stay. There can be improvements to some decks. I will be working with the Control version when I can refine a list and also with the Mixed UWR I think they are all powerful and there won't be one list to rule them all. I want to see a list that is similar to that of UWR control in Modern. I would like to hear your ideas of UWR and maybe help with refining of the decks. If there is anything I missed please let me know thank you for reading.

1367854992.0,29,self.spikes,1dspkz,[Standard]Meta Analysis,34,5,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/1dspkz/standardmeta_analysis/,"I know that it is pretty early to start anilysing the meta post DGM, but I thought I would provide a little data for those who are interested, all based off the top 50 decks at SCGNJ.

I did my work in Excel and loaded it all to Google Docs for you all. I'm sorry if it's a bit rough, I'm not very familiar with Google Docs to be perfectly honest.

Before I continue, [Here is the file](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B1BUB2Yo49IXNzhjdlpUTkJuOVE/edit).

What I did was pretty simple. I copied the first 50 or so decks from the SCG site, listing them by how they placed. I then applied a formula to turn the deck's placing into a weighted value. The formula I used was as follows:

    0.04*((Finish-50)^2)    

I wanted to put a heavy emphasis on higher finishers, although I might have emphasized it too much. Also, it would have been better to use records instead of placing, but I couldn't find those.

Using this value, I created a score by adding all the values for each deck in each Archetype. I then used this score to create a percentage for the deck, indicating its influence in the meta.

I thought this gave a pretty good illustration what the biggest decks were, as well as which fringe decks had the biggest influence.

From here, I focused on decks who's scores made up at least 5% of the score. For each of these archetype, I looked at the top deck and looked at what the deck was composed of. I also averaged these results to give people a better idea of what numbers of creatures, removal, wraths, counter spells, auras and planeswalkers to be prepared for.

I hope this helps out people trying to figure out how to crack this meta at least a little bit. Good luck brewing!

--------------------------------


**Edit:** Thanks to /u/jeffhoogland, I now have a version using match points and OMW% to calculate weighting. The formula I used for rating is as follows:

    =((Points^2/(30)^2)*(OMW%+100-(Best OMW% in top 30))/100)*((30-Finish)/30)^.05

This is a bit of a confusing formula. I think the best way to explain it is to show how changes in each variable effect the resulting score. Here are three graphs to illustrate just this:

[Change in Score with Respect to Points](http://i.imgur.com/DYEVUDk.png)

[Change in Score With Respect to OMW%](http://i.imgur.com/bcvFaP5.png)

[Change in Score With Respect to Place](http://i.imgur.com/UNAsHBf.png)

As you can see, points are weighted the most highly in the formula, followed by OMW%, with Placing having very little effect. I discounted placing as it is a redundant statistic outside of the top 8.

Using this new formula, the top decks change a bit. I'll let you take a look at the new result for yourself right here: https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B1qBJr__aGXuN2d3Z1ZhcDdGblE/edit?usp=sharing

In modern this card can be crazy with just your own cards. Imagine Clique'ing your opponent with a Notion Thief on the table:

""Bottom your best card, I draw one.""

Seems pretty awesome. Notion Thief would also be an all star used on combination with Jace Beleren. +2, I draw two? Sure - why not!

What would you do to change Modern?


Personally, I feel that Modern needs to keep certain cards which were banned because they *might* become out of hand in specific archetypes. Wild Nacatl and GSZ might be on an acceptable power level, but they would force all aggro decks to be Naya and all green creature decks to be toolboxes, respectively. Control isn't showing a strong presence at all, and Wizards needs to go back to supporting strong spells - by all means, keep the creature-creep, but don't focus on them *exclusively*. I think Daze could be reprinted, which would largely nullify the need for combo decks being neutered through bans, and I think that Ancestral Visions could possibly be brought back.

I've been playing Esper since Gatecrash hit, and I just haven't understood why Lingering Souls isn't seeing play. It's almost certainly my favorite card in the deck, since it's so versatile.

This is my second time drafting GTC in person, although I've done ~30 on drafts.in and cockatrice.   
  
The draft: We had a lot of people, and my pod ended up being 10 people. My p1p1 was basically a choice between mugging and frontline medic. I value mugging extremely highly (although not as highly as Rietzl first picking it over Domri Rade), although I'm pretty cautious of drafting Boros. I ended up taking the Medic. Pack 2 I picked Grisly Spectacle, and it wasn't very hard. The rare was gone and the rest of the playables were solid creatures like Drakewing Krasis. Pack 3 was the pivotal pick for me. Several playables, but the Syndic of Tithes stood out. I strongly prefer drafting Orzhov, and if I see that it's open, I will switch into it every time.
After that it was pretty straightforward. I saw that to my right, black was wide open, and white was open enough. I wasn't passing any great Orzhov to my left, so by the end of Pack 1 I was confident that I'd be able to continue. The only majorly difficult pick after that was p3p1, between a Knight of Obligation and a Blind Obedience. I ended up picking the Knight because I figured the additional creature would be better.   
We do a rare redraft, which I greatly prefer as it means everyone is building the best deck they can, as opposed to just money-drafting shocks and making sub-optimal picks. Before games started, everyone was told that someone had opened a foil Boros Reckoner.  
  
Decklist:  
3 Syndic of Tithes  
1 Basilica Guards  
3 Smite  
1 Vizkopa Guildmage  
2 Devour Flesh  
2 Grisly Spectacle  
1 Knight of Obligation  
1 Frontline Medic  
1 Kingpin's Pet  
1 Millennial Gargoyle  
1 Daring Skyjek  
1 Syndicate Enforcer  
1 Assault Griffin  
1 Basilica Screecher  
1 Cartel Aristocrat  
1 Vizkopa Confessor  
1 Court Street Denizen  
9 Plains  
8 Swamp  
  
Relevant Sideboard:  
2 Zarachi Tiger  
1 Millennial Gargoyle  
1 Vizkopa Confessor  
1 Shadow Slice  
1 Death's Approach  
   
I share Ben Stark's view that Orzhov should be as low-curve and aggressive as possible. Usually I actually draft the 18 land Orzhov deck, because I will try to have something at the top end, like Urbis Protector, or something like an Angelic Skirmisher if I get lucky. Here I went 17 lands and topped out with 4 drops. The Court St Denizen slot was variable, and I switched it out often for Zarachi Tigers or Death's Approach.  
  
Round 1: Dimir    

- Game 1 I lost to t1 Cloudfin Raptor, t2 Cloudfin Raptor, t3 Nightveil Specter, and t4 Deathcult Rogue. Too fast of a start for me to handle.  

- Game 2 I beat him handily, just raced with him Syndics and removed his relevant creatures.    

- Game 3 went long, on one turn I played a bunch of creatures instead of using my whole turn to play Vizkopa Confessor and get his last card. I'm fairly certain that card was Ogre Slumlord, which almost ended up beating me. We raced at that point, with him attacking with Dinrova Horror and me ignoring combat and just playing out everything I drew with my 4 extorters on board. At one point I attacked with my Knight into a rat token because I forgot it was there, as it was only represented by a die.  Eventually I draw the Grisly Spectacle I need to clear the Ogre Slumlord so I can start attacking for the win.    

(2-1 match, 1-0 total)  
  
Round 2: Gruul    

- Game 1 I remove all of his early creatures, he drops Assemble the Legion on turn 5. I start trying to race, eventually getting to a situation where I end the turn with him on 5 and me on 12. I have 5 power worth of flyers and he has 12 power worth of guys on the ground after AtL and I could block 3 of it. He has 1 card in hand, it was Signal the Clans, he searched for 3 bloodrushers and that was game.  

- Game 2: He got stuck on 2 lands until the fifth turn, I attacked with skyjek and pet for the win. I had removal for every creature he played after he did draw land, this one was quick.    

- Game 3: He kept a hand of 6 lands, 1 Ember Beast. He plays Assemble the Legion on turn 5 again. I try to race but I only have 1 flyer and he drops Crocanura soon after that. After this my only outlet is extort, I have 4 extorters on the board and hope to draw a spell every turn. He held off on attacks until he was at 8 and I was at 33. On this turn I needed to draw any spell to Extort out of the range of his 19 soldier tokens and a massive Cinder Elemental to the face. I drew a land and conceded.    

(1-2 match, 1-1 total)  
  
Round 3: Dimir  

- Game 1: I played aggressively first game. My grisly spectacle milled his Mind Grind so I was curious just how much milling his deck was capable of. I got him down low enough that I threatened lethal, and he spent a minute thinking about what to do, before he Mind Grinded me for 5 by tapping out. (he had 2). I still had cards left in library so I attacked for the win.    

- Game 2: I sided out Basilica Guards as I didn't see any non-evasive guys, and put in Vizkopa Confessor to hit his Mind Grinds and Cipher spells. This game went pretty similar to the first except he didn't come close to milling me. He did race pretty effectively with Metropolis Sprite and Deathcult Rogue though.    

(2-0 match, 2-1 total)  
  
Round 3: Boros  
I was told I was facing the only undefeated guy in the pod, and when I heard that I immediately guessed he was boros. A few people told me and confirmed this.  
- Game 1: I keep a hand of 2 plains, Daring Skyjek, Syndic of Tithes, Grisly Spectacle, Devour Flesh, and another non-land that I forget. I knew it was questionable but decided to risk it. He's on the play and drops Dutiful Thrull. I think that he is playing sub-optimal creatures to hit 3rd turn Battalion off Skynight. I draw an irrelevant card and play plains. Turn 2 he puts Madcap Skills on the Thrull and hits me. Here I get anxious because last time I drafted my only loss was to the Madcap Skills and Spire Tracer deck. I draw a swamp and am relieved. I Devour Flesh his guy when he tries to attack with it again and he thinks for a long time before playing Bomber Corps. I suspect that he kept a land with Thrull and Madcap and not much else action. I think I was correct and I proceeded to win the game pretty handily after that, just by attacking with flyers and extorting. I let all of his attacks through my Guards and Knight as I wasn't willing to get Martial Glory'ed, but I never saw it.   

- Game 2: Here I side in 2 Zarachi Tigers for the Confessor and the Court Street Denizen as I figured the life gain could do some work, and 2/3 blockers were good against most of the boros deck. I keep a hand very similar to game 1, with only lands being 2 plains, but having 2 white creatures, devour flesh, a smite, and something else. I tried to read him to see if he kept the madcap opener again, but I figured this was a safe keep and I didn't think he was going to go for the same trick. I was right and it seemed like he kept a slow hand, with a turn 2 Bomber Corps and no turn 3 play. This gave me time to set up a bit of a board position, and he he Mugged my Basilica Screecher and then dropped Wrecking Ogre. I Smited it and then had the advantage after I played Frontline Medic, and Daring Skyjek and the next turn. Here he thought for a minute before playing Mark for Death, making my Skyjek block his Dutiful Thrull. 2-for-1ing himself had me pretty confident that he was out of options and here I just swung with the team several times for the win.    
(2-0 in match, 3-1 total)      

We talked a bit after the games and I explained that he basically put me in Orzhov because he passed the Syndic to me (he was 2 to my right). He said he almost first-picked it, but picked Madcap instead. I thought it was kind of nice that I ended up beating him like this. Still, there were 3 people who were 3-1, so we had to wait around until  the round was over and tiebreakers were calculated before the ranking (and rare redraft pick order) could be determined. I ended up third, and somehow the top rares were just the foil Reckoner, a Sacred Foundry, and Aurelia's Fury. I took the Fury. 
 
All in all, I was happy with the draft. I wish that it didn't feel like the only match I lost was due to 2 turn 5 Assemble the Legions, but it was fun. I will aim to draft Orzhov with 17 lands instead of 18 in the future. I actually hope that the people to my right first pick the Syndic next time so I can draft another guild for once.

1345839038.0,29,self.spikes,yrsh5,Competitive Tournament Preparedness,33,4,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/yrsh5/competitive_tournament_preparedness/,"All right, I've done a post before on how to become more competitive, and I think now with the Spikes, many of the folks coming here are the targeted audience that I wanted with that article. However, I'm going to push past it for now as to not be redundant, and post a new one on going to Competitive REL tournaments. This is a list of things that will give you **the best chances to succeed** outside of deck choices and player mistakes.

Previous self post: http://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/qwg03/steps_to_moving_past_being_a_new_player_into/


**1.) Arrive Early / Register Early** - Seems silly or a given, but you will put yourself on tilt by arriving late. You want to give yourself ample amount of time to get there early and register your deck. Find those expensive rares that have been eluding you to borrow / buy / trade. Meet up with friends. maybe, heaven forbid, eat breakfast? I've personally arrived to a few tournaments late, trying to get my deck registered, realizing I'm missing cards and frantically searching for them only to arrive at my first game flustered. You make bad decisions under duress (hehe). **Don't forget your name on your registration / DCI number**. No reason to forget something as critical as this. Also, triple check your decklist. You can never be too safe!

**2.) Eat food. Stay Hydrated** - Bring small snacks that are clean (stay away from chips, and that melted Reeses you've had in your car for two weeks). Things like trail mix, etc. are excellent mini-snacks that can sate hunger and not grime up your cards. Staying hydrated with water will help you maintain a high level of alertness throughout the day. Shy away from high sugar / high caffeine drinks as the crash could make you shaky and bring down your alertness and awareness. 

**3.) Come with a Sideboard Plan for the Haymakers** - You may not be net decking. You may hate those who do. But they're out there, and you have to accommodate for them. Make certain you sit down with a friend and discuss your sideboard plans and why you chose them. Then explain to them what you're sideboarding in and what you're taking out and why. When they think those are reasonable choices, WRITE THEM DOWN. It is perfectly legal to bring in a sheet of paper that prepares you for how you want to sideboard. Additionally, I like to keep a sheet that explains exactly what my sideboard is so after my match, I double check against it as to make certain if I am deck checked, I won't get a match loss.

**4.) Watch the time before making decisions** - So many match losses come from you not showing up to your table before the round starts. A long round before, and you have to go to the restroom, you have to go have a cigarette (guilty of this one), whatever the case may be. Unless it's an emergency, if it is coming down to player turns soon, I wouldn't risk it. Not always will the turns be necessary. If it is a bathroom emergency, I would recommend stopping by a judge to just explain it quickly. He may be feeling friendly that day, he may just tell you you're getting a match loss. Either way, the worst case scenario is the same, it just matters for the best case scenario.

**5.) When spectating, do NOT interact** - I am very bad at this in my local scene, as I like to try and help (and at my old LGS was our local ""judge""). In competitive REL, the most interaction would be ""guys would you please stop the game while I go get a judge?"" If you try and explain to them what's going wrong, or give out information in any way with a comment or otherwise, you could get one person, or both a warning or worse, as well as yourself.  

**6.) With the latest rules changes, you have no obligation to point out missed triggers** - This one is a biggie. While you're playing your opponent, you are no longer obligated to inform them of missed, non-may triggers. However, if I recall correctly, there's one full turn that it may addressed that will be honored (if it happens on an opponents second main phase, they have until the next to catch it). This may be beneficial to you at times, and it may hurt you on others. Personally, I would like the board state to be represented correctly so I usually inform them of the triggers, as I don't want to be operating under the pretense that they missed it and have them recall it to foil what I've been working with.

**7.) Whenever you don't understand something / seems fishy / all around uncomfortable, ask for a judge** - That's what they're there for folks. Use them. They're a resource to make certain everything runs smoothly. The cannot tell you anything that may influence your decision, so ask direct questions, or explain gamestate and ask about the question you have.

**8.) Thoroughly Shuffle your opponents deck** - We've seen a lot of things about ""potential"" cheats on /r/magicTCG lately, don't let it happen to you. Grab that deck, spend 15 seconds on shuffling it before handing it back. It keeps them from pulling too many shenanigans, and it is also a nice to evaluate game state.

**9.) Always pile shuffle your deck** - And not for the ""randomization"" reason. Pile shuffle to count your deck to make certain no card is lost, missing or added. Pile shuffle the same way, so you don't have to actually count: you can just understand where you should end up. Afterwords, you should still shuffle as though you have not pile shuffled. I have read somewhere 7 riffle shuffles fully randomize your deck, but I cannot say perfectly from memory right now.... 

**10. Read the Rules for Competitive REL** - Pretty straight forward here. Read the rules to understand how it works for your given format, and double check to make certain no cards have since been banned that previously weren't.

1374588440.0,27,self.spikes,1ivunh,[Discussion] SCG Invitational in Somerset this Weekend!,31,4,106,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/1ivunh/discussion_scg_invitational_in_somerset_this/,"[u/DarkM27](http://www.reddit.com/user/Darkm27), myself and two other local players are trecking across the US this weekend to play. Any other spikes going?

**Some helpful tips for those playing in the main event this weekend:**

You can earn byes for these events. To see if you have one/two byes (or how close you are) look up your open points [here](http://www.starcitygames.com/openpoints/).

The format is split between Standard/Legacy. This weekend is standard first, so that means the top 8 is standard. You do not need to have your standard **and** legacy deck lists together at the first player meeting (although it doesn't hurt). There will be a second player meeting after round 4 to collect the legacy deck lists.

It is OK to share copies of cards between your standard and legacy deck lists.

Top 96 or 15+ points makes the second day of the event. Generally you need the 15+ points. [The last invitational in Atlanta had under 300 people and 104 made day 2 with 15+ points](http://8e8460c4912582c4e519-11fcbfd88ed5b90cfb46edba899033c9.r65.cf1.rackcdn.com/www/scg_events/files/20130406120021000000.html). 

I never speak in terms of 100%, but generally speaking a record of X-3 or better is locked for top 8. [At the last invitational in Atlanta four people with a record of X-4 made top 8, while another three people at X-4 missed on tie breakers](http://8e8460c4912582c4e519-11fcbfd88ed5b90cfb46edba899033c9.r65.cf1.rackcdn.com/www/scg_events/files/20130406172808000000.html). Obviously every event is slightly different - but X-3 or better is a good rule of thumb.

Top 8 matches are best of 5, not best of 3.

Good luck this weekend spikes!

1367283155.0,26,self.spikes,1ddmvs,[Standard] Aristocrats Act 2 going forward,29,3,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/1ddmvs/standard_aristocrats_act_2_going_forward/,"http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/act-2-29-04-13-2/

This is Brad Nelson's updated Act 2 list that's been making its way around. I ran it at the PTQ in DC last week to some success, although two of my three losses were to myself and not the deck. It's a great deck and a lot of fun to play. But I want to see what people's opinions are of the deck going forward with DGM releasing this week. Obviously new cards means new options for the deck and new hurdles for it to overcome, and with Act 2 pretty popular now, more people will be packing hate for it. 

First things first, I'm thinking some enchantment removal might be in order. Curse of Death's Hold can really shut the deck down, forcing it to rely solely on Boros Reckoner + Blasphemous Act, which becomes a lot harder once you no longer have access to your tokens. Not only that, but I've found my worst match up (so far) is Bant Hexproof. Maybe not the most popular deck, but it certainly pops up here and there and certainly in my local meta (two at my store run it). Hoping for an early Blasphemous Act just doesn't cut it. Also, I believe that new RW blink enchantment will see play (which is dangerous!), and in the mirror, having something against an opposing Assemble the Legion is nice. And, most importantly, Rest in Peace! Denies the deck its Blood Artist triggers and Doomed Traveler triggers, which can be pretty annoying. With that in mind, I've been considering the new Wear // Tear from DGM as a SB option, or Paraselene as a fall back. 

Secondly, I played against a Junk deck running new DGM cards, including Voice of Resurgence, Advent of the Wurm and Blood Baron. I've found playing against Voice of Resurgence to be beneficial, it's a waste of a slot against the deck. Not only can I just ignore it without any penalty in game 1, where it doesn't do anything, in game 2, I can Mark of Mutiny or Conscript it and then sac it to an Aristocrat to get the x/x token, which happened in every game against the deck. It was wonderful. I also enjoyed playing against Advent over Restoration Angel. It was always obvious when he had the Advent in hand, and I had no fear of running a Falkenrath Aristocrat out and attacking, instead of having to think a bit if I knew it was a Restoration Angel instead. The biggest threat was the Blood Baron. It's immune to all the removal in the deck and we can only get around it with our spirit tokens or Aristocrat, or hoping to pull off a Blasphemous Act. It is a 5 drop, so it's not the scariest, but it does give me pause and makes me consider Mizzium Mortars in the sideboard. I'm also thinking it's a possible SB option for the mirror, it can turn the tide.

At the PTQ, I played against an Aristocrats variant that ran Thundermaw in the main board. It was highly effective and won the game for him. How do you guys feel about bringing him in SB or even MB? 

Another card I've been considering is Profit // Loss, which could be decent in the mirror.

Finally, I've been wondering if the Blasphemous Act combo still has a place in the main board. It was mainly there to deal with Junk Reanimator, which I think may be on the decline. It was meant to be a Reanimator beater, and is only kept in the main board against that deck, Naya Blitz and GR Aggro (and possibly the mirror). Every other deck it's taken out.

1363089537.0,25,self.spikes,1a55gi,[Modern] 6-2 at a PTQ with GR Tron - Report,29,4,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/1a55gi/modern_62_at_a_ptq_with_gr_tron_report/,"Tron tournament report

I played GR Tron at a PTQ on Saturday. I thought I would give a tournament report. This was my decklist (http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/gr-tron-v2/) and I finished 14th / 142. I went 6-2.

* R1 - Amulet of Vigor (2-0)

Went 2-0 against the Amulet of Vigor / Primeeval Titan combo deck. The key thing here is blowing up their stuff and getting a Wurmcoil into play. Game 1, I resolved a Wurmcoil which meant I could hold off his massive Primeeval Titan. Game 2, I had an Oblivion stone sitting on the board to which he couldn’t respond. The amulet deck seems super janky and very reliant on nobody interacting with it much before turn three or four.

* R2 - Splinter Twin (2-1)

Against a pretty standard Splinter Twin list. Game 1 he was a bit mana screwed and I was not sure what I was playing, so racing a turn 3 karn against his lands meant it was all over. Game two, he resolved out of nowhere and I realised what I was playing against.

Game three, I boarded in both slaughter games. I managed to resolve both of them, naming Splinter Twin and Kiki respectively. He ended up going massively beat down against me. I only won the third game because I managed to resolve an Emrakul, Nature’s Claim my own expedition map and tutor up a Phyrexia’s Core to sacrifice a spellskite for one life.

* R3 - Splinter Twin (0-2)

I lost badly here. I misplayed game one (I didn’t exile a Zealous Conscripts, as I didn’t realise he could combo off with the Conscripts) and just lost game two to a very quick Splinter Twin going off.

* R4 - Affinity (0-2)

Again, I lost badly here. In game one, he raced me and played around a Pyroclasm really well (Master of Etherium was played super sensibly). I boarded badly in game two, and got smashed again.

* R5 - BUG (2-1)

Tron shines against BUG and other mid-range decks. There isn’t much to say here apart from Relics of Progenitus lock down Snapcasters beautifully, and all Tarmogofy type decks just cannot race you when you’re playing turn 3 or 4 Wurmcoils.

* R6 - Hexproof Bogle (2-1)

This is another decent match up for Tron. He smashed me game one, but I came back really well with extra Spellskites, Wurmcoils, etc. I managed to resolve a Chalice of the Void in game 3 for both 1 and 2 counters respectively, which locked his deck down.

* R7 - RDW (2-1)

This was again a really tight match up. I won game one, lost game two and won game three. The key thing that won me game three was a Chalice of the Void for one. I realised, as the day went on, how back breaking Chalices of the Void really are against so many decks in the format. 

* R8 - Affinity (2-1)

This was super tense, as I was hoping I might just be able to steal a top 8 spot. Game one, he dropped his hand straight into a four-for-one pyroclasm, but game two I just couldn’t deal with him. Game three, I mull’ed to 6 with a hand of Eye, Forest, Chalice, Map, Map, Egg. On the face of it, this hand looks dreadful, but I played Chalice for zero and it totally locked his deck down. Affinity cannot do anything if it cannot cast zero drops. He just passed the turn back to me without playing a land or anything, and I drew into my tron pieces, resolved a wurmcoil and that was it.

Reflections on my deck and GR Tron

•	Life totals matter. I find my Tron deck consistently stabilised the board against affinity, rdw and other aggro variants on around 4-5 life. This was painfully close to bolt range. Next time I play, I am tempted to sideboard a couple of Timley Reinforcements. Getting that few extra life is so vital. With that in mind, Phyrexia’s core did excellent work for me all day. It got me extra life, it protected my wurmcoils from Path to Exiles and brought my Spine of Ish Sah truly online. Of the twenty lands that Tron plays, there is room for two utility lands (except for Tron pieces, Forest, Eye and Groves). I recommend one of those should be Phyrexia’s Core, even if you are not playing the Spine.

•	Wurmcoils are more important than I thought. Resolving one of those is back breaking against most decks, and puts so much pressure on the table. It buys you a truck worth of life and holds your opponent up. I am tempted to mainboard four of them in the future.

•	Spine of Ish Sah is pretty useful. It can work as a fifth Karn and when you can tutor up a Phyrexia’s Core (and you often will have extra Tutors spare after Tron is online), you can rip apart their mana base every single turn and gain life in the process.

•	I mainboarded a Spellskite to deal with infect / bogle / etc. It never became too relevant, but that said, I am not sure I drew it when I needed to either. It is probably still worth playing, but it wasn’t the backbreaking singleton I was hoping.

•	Defense Grid is fantastic against control decks (I was expecting to see a lot of them), but I felt it was overkill. Tron is already a decent match up against control. I would rather have had Torpor Orbs to deal with Splinter Twin, Clique, Resto Angel, Zealous Conscripts, etc.

•	Slaughter Games did great work for me, and I drew them more often than I thought I would.

•	Chalice of the Void was a sideboard all-star. It basically reads ‘I win’ against a huge number of decks. If you are on the play against affinity, you should probably mull to 4 or 5 to try and find it so you can play it for 0. If you are against infect, bogle, rdw, any aggro deck, eggs – being able to resolve Chalice for 1 is almost an ‘I-win’ button, even if it slows down your eggs, maps and stirrings. This is a definite four-of.

This would probably be my new list; http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/gr-tron-v3/

Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated!

Was thrilled to see so much positive energy towards the idea of a MODO stream.  Based on the feedback I received, you all really like Modern.  Good!  I do too.  I play UW Control (if you can't tell by the list you'll soon see).

1) I stream using Cockatrice.  I straight-up cannot afford to buy my Modern deck a second time.  
2) I come to you all, awesome spikes, to benevolently request a brief loan of your digital cardboard on MODO.  If you play Modern, and would be willing to help out a wingman, I would play on MODO.  I'll have a list of cards I'd need below.  
3) Someone else streams...always an option.

* 4 Cryptic Command  
* 1 Baneslayer Angel  
* 1 Batterskull  
* 2 Aven Mindcensor

If you'd like to help me out, PM or Comment with ways you can assist.  If not, that's fine too.  **Don't feel obligated!**  
  
If you think Cockatrice is acceptable, let it be known!  I've heard some of you mention that it may be *cooler* to have 2 of the spikes stream via Google Hangouts and discuss hands, etc.  I can definitely take this into account, as can the other mods.  
  
Assuming I can get the cards for MODO (or would be using Cockatrice), I can stream on Monday or Tuesday of next week, after GP Charlotte.  Until then!

Then I ask myself, if I mulligan into these 6 cards, would I mulligan to 5. I probably mulligan more than optimal still, but I feel that I'm closer than most too optimal. It's an extremely complex decision, maybe the most complex you make in an average game. 

Are there any shortcuts you use for mulligans? 

What are your thoughts on the shortcut I use? 

------------------------

Edit for Example: Playing in a Gatecrash draft. Your 7 cards are:

* Mountain
* Mountain
* Mountain
* Forest
* Island
* Island
* Zhur-Taa Swine

You are splashing 2 urban evolution in your RG deck and got bot of the Islands (also playing a Verdant Haven
for a 3rd blue). You have some aggressive cards, but a big late game too. You have to draw a Forest to cast a few of your other spells, but if you draw your Evolutions then are live. So the question is, would I mulligan if I drew this: 

* Mountain
* Mountain
* Mountain
* Forest
* Island
* Zhur-Taa Swine

Would you Mulligan to 5? I know this isn't the best example, but it was a situation that came up yesterday, so it was the first thought, for an example, that I had.

So if your local crowd is similar to mine, then everyone is talking about Esper now. The better mana means that a deck with access to Lingering Souls, Sphinx's Revelation, spot removal, wraths, and Drownyard is likely highly powerful. The question is, what version of Esper is best?

Some are slower, control builds. They look to deal with the opponent's threats with spot removal and wraths, gain incremental value, and then Sphinx's Revelation for a bunch to lock up the game, while killing with Drownyard. [Here's a sample list that I'm currently planning on running after Gatecrash hits](http://magic.tcgplayer.com/db/deck.asp?deck_id=1089499). I should note that I'm planning on adding another black source to better cast Liliana, or removing Liliana altogether, or adding two black sources while going up to 27 lands. I should also note that I'm testing a bit of a transformational sideboard with 4 Resto Angel and the 4th Augur in the board to turn into a Flash variant against the decks where tons of removal and sweepers are bad. So far it's worked out fairly well, since everyone sides out their removal after game one and then has trouble dealing with Angel, but I need more testing to know if it's good or not for sure.

The other option is a more tempo-styled build modeled after UW Flash. These generally run Angel, Augur, Snapcaster, and often Geist and Obzedat. They look to build tons of incremental advantage through their synergistic creatures and powerful spells, and often tempo out aggressive decks with Geist or Obzedat. [Here's an example Caleb Durward posted on Twitter a couple days ago](http://pastebin.com/6yLyX4cM).

You can also attempt to grind them out if you play a controlling deck since they have a limited number of threats. Keep it mind this usually requires multiple pieces though since Moorland Haunt + Runechanter's Pike is essentially infinite power. Curse of Death's Hold goes a long way if you can power it through via Duress or other methods. Staff of Nin also shuts off half the attacking part of the deck. If you want to grind them out, look at different kinds of answers.

I talk about it a bit in my article this week along with why the deck is so strong: http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/silvestri-says-restoration-of-the-status-quo/

Outside of that, the deck doesn't have a great match vs. very aggressive strategies. I don't really agree with those thinking Humans vs. UW is a walk in the park; however it does slightly favor Humans. Mono Red can be really tough if you stop and think about what the UW player has as options at any given attack. BR Zombies should eat if for breakfast if you have removal for Restoration Angel / Augur. 

In fact if you don't want to change your deck, the best thing you can do is stop and THINK about what possibilities are actually available. 

Combat Tricks: Unsummon, Azorius Charm, Restoration Angel, Snapcaster Mage

Hard Counters: Essence Scatter, Dissipate, Rewind

Soft Counters: Syncopate

Potential Life Gain: Azorius Charm, Sphinx's Revelation

I can't tell you how many times over the past week I've gotten free cards because somebody made a wretched attack and just didn't take an angle into account. I raced Mono Red when they could have lived long enough to kill me when he swung with a Thundermaw Hellkite into an 11/4 Angel along with a handful of other creatures. Azorius Charm, gain 11. Untap, swing, snapcaster Charm, gain another 10. 

If he had swung with his Hellrider + army and left Hellkite back, he could have simply burnt whatever guy I blocked to prevent half of that life swing and likely won instead of putting himself on dead within a turn. Really think about your options before committing to attacks.

EDIT: Forgot to mention, try to play post-board games in a real fashion instead of the 'ol snap overextend into Supreme Verdict.

The Beginning


There are quite a few differences between competitive Magic and casual Magic; money, time, skill, even knowledge. Here’s a basic primer to get you started.


On average, competitive players spend as little money as possible when it comes to Magic. That doesn't mean we're poor or cheap, we just maximize the amount of value gained from money spent. Dropping 140 dollars on a playset of Bonfires when you’re never going to play them isn’t the best idea. If you want to play with something, utilize a proxy. Don’t actually commit to buying a card until you’re absolutely sure you’re going to need it. Proxy up entire decklists if you want, but remember, never spend more than you have to.


The easiest way to get the cards you need is start a playtest group. Find a couple of friends who are willing to make the competitive jump with you and work together. You don’t have the duals you need, your buddy might. Want to play Dredge? Borrow the Bridges from a mate. Your buddy wants to play Maverick? Loan him the Savannahs.
This accomplishes several things. You don’t have to break the bank buying cards for a multitude of decks, allowing you to shift your deck choice and account for changing metagames. It also helps create camaraderie between you and your playtest partners. The more competitive you become, the more time you’ll spend playing Magic. Might as well make some friends right?


Speaking of time, it is utilized completely differently when you make the swap from casual to competitive. Instead of just playing games and spending a couple hours relaxing, that’s time used for playtesting. Games are now hours of theorycraft. Sometimes you can take an hour just discussing a single turn.


What card should I play? What land should I drop? Should I swing? All of these are now questions you have to ask yourself on a consistent basis whenever you play. 


Playtesting also allows you to fine-tune your deck. Should I run the 4 Mana Leaks? Tragic Slip or Gut Shot? How many Path to Exiles do I want to run mainboard? How is my aggro/combo/control matchup? Can I consistently beat the mirror?


If you’re unfortunate enough to not have a consistent playgroup, go play FNM. Get good at it. Understand that even though FNM is the kiddy pool, it's still a start. Use FNM as a playtest session. Granted, many of the other players at FNM will use homebrews, budget versions, other random jank crap, but it's viable. The important part is that all decks tend to fall under three categories aggro/combo/control.  Understand how you can play against all three archetypes.
Get blown out by homebrew infect? Well, I guess I sometimes lose to all in creature based combos. Some random Goblin tribal deck beat me? I guess I can't deal with a ton of creatures swarming the board. Some kid brought MonoBlackControl and blew you out with Mutilates? Learn to not overextend.


It's not a perfect system, but you should be able to break down all your losses and understand why, even at an FNM level. This is the hard part of competitive Magic. Whenever you lose, your first thought should never be to blame variance or luck. If it is luck based, it's luck based and you'll never be able to change that fact. Try and find alternate lines of play that would've bought you another turn. See if that extra turn would've given you an out. Maybe you could've killed him a couple turns ago, but failed to attack. Always look back and try and find mistakes in your play.


Finally, learn what the metagame is. This word is tossed around a lot, sometimes incorrectly, sometimes correctly. Essentially, a “metagame” or “metagaming” is utilizing outside knowledge to influence your decisions. In the case of Magic, you know (from tournament results) that Delver is popular so you know that the current “meta” is Delver-centric. This can give you a bonus when playing and constructing. By understanding the “metagame”, you are able to work on more information and understand plays better.
For example (without “metagame”)


Turn 1: Seachrome Coast, Ponder, Shuffle/Draw.


What deck is he playing? U/W Control? U/W Midrange? Delver? Miracles? Maybe some jank homebrew using the lands he had available? Without a metagame, we have to ask ourselves all these questions and play around a multitude of decks.


(With “metagame)


Turn 1: Seachrome Coast, Ponder, Shuffle/Draw.


We can narrow the deck choice down to pretty much just U/W Delver and Miracles. Turn 1 Ponder followed by Shuffle/Draw means that they are displeased with the 3 cards they looked at. If they’re playing Delver, maybe they have no action or the 2nd land drop. Against Miracles, they don’t have an answer to your Turn 1 or 2 threat and they’re digging.


As you can see, by understanding the “metagame” we were able to trim our decisions and inferences from 5/6 deck choices, to just two.
However, everyone tries to understand the “metagame” and as a result, it changes on a consistent basis. New cards are introduced, old ones are utilized in a new fashion. People want to break the mold of the old “metagame” and confuse you. As a result, take the “metagame” with a grain of salt. Understand that a majority of the time, the meta will be stable, but there will be sudden shifts on occasion.


The most important thing to remember is that Magic is a game. Relax. Have fun. Don’t force yourself into playing if you don’t want to. Getting to the Pro Tour is the dream, but that means nothing if you hate the game.

As you probably know, official Return to Ravnica spoilers begin on Monday. Similar to /r/magictcg, at approximately midnight each day, one of the mods will post a thread with the text of all the spoilers. That thread will also be updated throughout the day. If a card is missing, please **don't** start a new thread; just leave a comment with the relevant info and it will get updated ASAP.

Please try to keep all or most spoiler-related comments in these threads. This is pretty much the same drill as /r/magictcg so I'm sure we'll be fine.

**Please also try to keep the [signal-to-noise ratio](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal-to-noise_ratio) of your comments high.** For example, a comment consisting solely of ""OMG SHOCKLANDS"" would make me sad, but something like ""I'm so glad Dark Confidant got reprinted, he's going to make Zombies even more insane"" is fine. This community was created so it would be easier to discuss competitive Magic with like-minded players, so be respectful to everyone and try to keep your comments on point.

Finally, we will be getting some spoilers from the Magic party at PAX Prime on Saturday night. Those will also be posted here (ideally by a mod) as soon as possible.

Hey there /r/spikes I recently took a break from magic but I'm back at it again. I've taken to looking at recent lists and how recent opens/GP's have gone. What I realized is that UWR has evolved in the current meta quite a bit lately and right now there are only really two dominant versions of it, one is the control variant which uses walkers and aetherling, the other uses Snapcaster, Augur, and Restoration Angel with thundermaw in the side. Both have put up results in the past on MTGO daily's and premier events and even PTQs.

**Here are the lists I found**

[Midrange List](http://www.mtgtop8.com/event?e=5308&amp;d=230609)

[Thundermaw Main](http://www.mtgtop8.com/event?e=5211&amp;d=230042)

What is the purpose of Thundermaw from the side, Counterflux Main, and the current set up of spells?

[Control List](http://www.mtgtop8.com/event?e=5210&amp;d=230036)

Why has this version fallen out of place and why is the midrange version so much more dominant?

**The Meta**

Looking at recent list of daily's, premier events, ptq's, and the occasional bigger events I've noticed that the Control variant of UWR is basically gone what is the reason behind this?

From what I've noticed Grull aggro, Jund, Junk Re-An, UWR, Naya, and Junk Cats are the big decks in the format and this will change once M14 is available, reading up on what is being released Bant Pants seems to be in favor soon to come. Does UWR have a good match up against this deck in it's current form?

Since I haven't played in quite some time I'm seeing new decks that hadn't been there when I left. What makes Junk Cats better than Act 1 or 2? Why is Liliana in the side of Jund and How to deal with Ruric Thar? Is Junk Re-An still top dog in this format?

1372087376.0,25,self.spikes,1gz0xk,[MODERN] Developing and improving blue tron.,36,11,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/1gz0xk/modern_developing_and_improving_blue_tron/,"Mono-U tron has been a deck for quite some time, but it's a relatively small percentage of the metagame and many modern players don't prepare for it -- green-based tron decks, despite being less common since the fall of Jund, remain the 'face' of tron.

Blue based tron has been putting up fantastic results recently, but I've always discarded it as a 'budget choice' -- indeed, many of the mono blue decks built play cards you'll rarely prepare for or see in the format, like Platinum Angel and mindslaver.

Here's an example mono blue tron list, and the cards most commonly used in the deck ---
http://mtgo-stats.info/archInfo/?aID=506&amp;fName=Modern

You counter and delay threats, primarily with remand and condescend, then go on to create backbreaking card advantage with Thirst for Knowledge. You have a soft lock against control mirrors with Spell Burst -- your mana advantage, assuming they don't have land destruction or spreading seas, will be more than enough to counter every relevant threat -- and can theoretically stabilize against aggro using Wurmcoil, sad robots, and, although this is a bit fringe right now, sideboarded red 
or white sweepers.

Your win condition is usually going to be Mindslaver -- locks are very possible with your 1x Academy Ruins, and this combo also means your lategame expedition maps aren't necessarily dead cards. It also means it's relatively safe to discard mindslaver to thirst early on in an attrition based matchup.

My problems with the deck --

1: If you lose the coin flip and your (aggro) opponent has a keepable hand, you have almost certainly just lost.

Obviously, this is a huge problem, and a newer solution is to run 4x scalding tarn 4x steam vents in the main with sideboarded pyroclasms and other red removal.

I'm uncertain if this is correct. I've won far too many games against robots and affinity with 2-3 life left before recovering to want to take any additional damage from my lands. You can still certainly win with a god hand containing all three urza lands + wurmcoil, but what if you're up against a tempo build running path? Do you just sit there and cry?

Even worse, the line of signet/talisman -&gt; sad robot -&gt; wurmcoil becomes less common, as the decks splashing red are commonly cutting the fourth copy of sad robot -- they don't have enough basic lands to fetch!

Personally, I'm a little perplexed (hurr) by the choice of counterspells in the deck. While an [i]ideal[/i] game will involve searching out and playing all of your urza lands while delaying your opponent with cards like Remand -- no doubt an extremely powerful tempo spell -- not every game is going to play out like this. We need more hard counters in the main, and my build in the premier event yesterday (4-2, unfortunately, but was great practice) has a lot of success with spell snare. It made matchups like affinity and melira-pod MUCH less painful, and gives us an option to do something on turn 1 when on the draw. It also counters a lot of relevant hate, such as stony silence, but I'm going to be honest here---

Opponents playing decks like melira-pod should not be siding that card in against this deck. You need to become aggro and beat down as hard as possible. Spending two mana to shut down expedition map, signets, and mindslaver may seem incredible, but the deck has more diverse win conditions, and can just repeal @ EoT anyways. I'd directly attribute at least two wins to 'oversideboarding' on my opponents' part.

Still, spell snare is a bizarre exclusion from mono-u tron builds so far, and I'd like to hear why. It isn't even dead in the mirror!

In the dozens of jund matchups (including white jund, blue jund, insert a bunch of stupid names here) I've played, my most common losses occurred when a turn 2 dark confidant resolved and the opponent was able to directly answer my threats 1 for 1 while gaining card advantage. This is the ideal line for the deck, obviously, but we really should have a way to counter a turn 2 confidant on the draw if we aren't able to remove it.

Spell snare is dead against no matchup, but it's extremely bad in the mirror. Remember -- always keep hate for tron decks in your sideboard! You should always be targeting two decks when playing competitively at any level below pro -- the most dominant, and the cheapest. These decks are Melira Pod and Tron respectively, with honorable mentions for 'cheap' going to soul sisters and bant hexproof.

Batterskull is another inclusion to combat aggro/tempo decks, although not one I've tested yet. The 4/4 body may trade as often as it profitably blocks, but the vigilance and continuous lifegain seem amazing, as does the ability to bounce itself in response to a path. You can even toss one on a sad robot or treasure mage!



2: For a control deck, our combo matchups are shockingly bad.


Melira pod isn't a combo deck -- it's an aggro deck that just happens to get infinite life or deal infinite damage a terrifying amount of time. This realization is crucial if you want to realize ""who's the beatdown"" and know your role in the matchup. I'm talking about scapeshift and R/U twin.

Mono-U tron is prevalent enough that people know it runs no true 'hard' counters, with the exception of dispel-bait spell burst. We obviously aren't aggressive enough to be able to beat down before a combo goes off, so it's common to just lose when opponents break up your urzatron and play their combos around condescend. Remand certainly helps slow them down, but it doesn't really hurt them -- we need to take out combo pieces for good, not delay them, as any infinite combo is going to outrace what we're doing.

Spell snare helps quite a bit with scapeshift matchups, countering their remands and such, and Platinum Angel is surprisingly effective against kiki-pod, but neither are capable of delaying the decks long enough to get consistent wins.

I honestly don't know how to properly answer these decks, short of replacing my copies of Remand with Mana Leaks. Dispel in the sideboard has been very effective, but it'd be nice, if a bit of a pipe dream, to be able to win game 1 against combo.



3 -- Path to Exile negates all of your win conditions except Mindslaver, which is already mediocre against aggro.

Batterskull solves all of this. I realize you can't tutor batterskull with Treasure Mage, but Treasure Mage isn't the strongest card in the first place -- I've already cut it to 2, and I certainly do not want to see it every game. While it tutors for what is considered our main wincon, Mindslaver, the body left behind has rarely been relevant. I do not think 'tutorable with treasure mage' should remain a criteria for every win condition in this deck, nor should we be exclusively playing 7-drops due to the ideal situation of having all three urza lands on turn 3.

A final possibility and proposed inclusion is Myr Incubator. Extensive testing at 1-2 of shows it's often capable of making ten myr -- even late in the game. Of course, in an ideal situation, it will make much more than that, often being able to win the game in a single swing after accounting for fetch/shockland damage. The card was a powerhouse in standard, and it's proving quite potent in Modern too.

Of course, 12 is a lot of mana, and you never want multiples. I only recommend it if you're facing a lot of tron mirrors, which are more than a little difficult to break open.


That's all the testing I've done for now, just a few dozen matches. Let me know what you think, and I'll upload a few decklists in the comments.

Wilt-Leaf Liege also works well with both those cards, and also with Loxodon Smiter. So these four cards synergize when on the field are resistant to control. Putting them together seems like it could lead to something viable, but what?
4x each of Voice, Souls, Liege, Smiter, plus 4x mana dorks and 23 land (this will be a midrange list) leaves 17 open spots.

What can be done with those 17 open spots to make a real deck? It already looks similar to the GW hatebears list, but 17 isn't enough room for the full variety of actual hate bears plus removal. It also looks like it could go with the junk version of the jund/junk shell, but that also requires more than 17 slots (3-4 Lili, 6-8 discard, 7-10 removal, 4 Bob) and goes better with cheaper, less beefy threats like 'Goyf.

I've been thinking of making it 4 Finks for additional card advantage and working with Liege, 3 Bob for value and to use make use of the life from Finks, and then 9 removal spells including Qasali Pridemage (to supplement the GW creature beats) and then Path and Dismember / Decay / Disfigure.

I plan to try some proxy testing of this tomorrow, but does it seem viable? I don't know if it will just be too much of a ""fair"" deck to work without the disruption that comes with the similar midrange fair decks like hatebears and jund.",,False,,t5_2utkz,False,,,True,t3_1gwst4,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/1gwst4/modern_lingering_souls_works_well_with_voice/,

The biggest mistake I think I made in Nashville last weekend was not playing more Searing Spear. I think this is an easy 3-4 of in any deck playing red removal right now as their primary source of killing things.

I'm also going back and forth as to whether main decking a couple of pillar of flame is the right call. They are fairly good against aggressive decks and Voice (which all the bant flash/hexproof decks have been playing). Plus in matchups like reanimator it kills dorks on turn 1 and it can at least kill Huntmaster against Jund.

What is your opinion on red removal right now spikes?

To consider a specific list I am leaning towards playing the following eleven spells main deck tomorrow:

* 2 Pillar of Flame
* 2 Mizzium Mortars
* 4 Searing Spear
* 3 Turn / Burm",,False,,t5_2utkz,False,,,True,t3_1f08vu,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/1f08vu/standard_optimal_red_removal_as_of_524/,

My highly anticipated tournament report shamelessly plugged by our own [Jeff Hoogland](http://www.reddit.com/user/jeffhoogland). You can find the 75 I ran at the open [here](http://sales.starcitygames.com//deckdatabase/displaydeck.php?DeckID=55954) with the changes I've made since my last report for my top 16 in Milwaukee. Enough Babbling lets hop in.

**Round 1 - Shardless Bug**

I'll start off by saying this is a very hard match up due to the fact that they just simply draw more cards than me and pull ahead. Game 1 my opponent keeps a hand that got punished by a wasteland which I was lucky enough to have 2 of in my opening hand that where followed up by a Bob and he quickly concedes. Game 2 is a bit more of a grind where I end up getting blown out by Bob flipping a Tombstalker and my opponent casting a whipflare with a board that lived through it. I stumble on lands game 3 and it ends pretty quickly. So I start the open off to a bad start but I don't let it get to me.

My side boarding went as follows:

+1 Notion Thief

+2 Tombstalker

+1 Umezawa's Jitte

+1 Maelstrom Pulse


-2 Daze

-3 Thoughtseize

0-1


**Round 2 - Dredge**

Contrary to popular belief Deathrite Shaman is not very good against Dredge due to the sheer number of things they put in the graveyard that being said I start the game off by mulliganing an unplayable 7 into a 6 with 2 Thoughtseizes and a Liliana. It doesn't take long for my keep to look embarrassing as my opponents first turn is City of Brass into Careful Study discarding some dredgers. Things look bad for our hero and I pack it in pretty quickly. Game 2 I open up on the play with a Thoughtseize and take his only enabler in the form of a Careful Study and add a Goyf and a Deathrite Shaman to the board to clean up after his slow start. Game 3 I board out my Thoughtseizes on the draw and brought in my Phyrexian Revoker just as a body that can potentially shut off LED. I'm pleasantly surprised when I look like I stone cold master and have the Revoker to name Grindstone after he shows me his transformative sideboard I did not get to see game 2. The revoker is able to close the game out with the help of a Jitte and a Jace.

My side boarding went as follows:

+1 Nihil Spellbomb

+2 Surigical Extraction

+1 Umezawa's Jitte

+1 Maelstrom Pulse

+1 Blue Elemental Blast

+3 Engineered Plague


-2 Hymn to Tourach

-2 Liliana of the Veil

-2 Thoughtseize

-1 Sylvan Library

-2 Jace, the Mind Sculptor

On game 3 when I was on the draw I took out the 2 remaining Thoughtseizes for the Revoker and a Jace

1-1

**Round 3 - Storm (TES)**

I like my storm match up a lot due to a large amount of main deck disruption I have combined with a fairly quick clock. So I wasn't to unhappy when my opponent starts off with a Gemstone Mine into a ponder. I lead with a shaman and he follows up with a 2nd cavern and a preordain. I wasteland the fresh cavern and watch him miss his next land drop and have to burn the last counter on a brainstorm which misses, it's pretty text book from there. Game 2 my Thoughtseize gets duressed out of my hand and my opponent goes for the turn 2 kill and fizzles. I follow up with a 5/6 goyf and a Zur's Weirding and he concedes. 

My side boarding went as follows:

+1 Nihil Spellbomb

+2 Surigical Extraction

+1 Phyrexian Revoker

+1 Notion Thief

+1 Blue Elemental Blast

+1 Zur's Weirding

+1 Duress

-1 Sylvan Library

-2 Baleful Strix

-4 Abrupt Decay

-2 Jace, the Mind Sculptor

2-1

**Round 4 - Sneak and Show**

Much like storm I like this matchup due to my large amount of disruption. My opponent is kind enough to shuffle towards me showing me a show and tell and a sneak attack (be careful when you shuffle kids) so I mulligan accordingly. Naturally this means I go to 5 with my only disruption being a Hymn that gets misdirected and I lose game 1. Game 2 starts with some hand hate and ends with him empty handed facing down a Zur's weirding and a Goyf. Game 3 we have a fairly long game which ends with my Notion thief staring down his Grislebrand after a show and tell followed up with a Liliana.

My side boarding went as follows:

+1 Phyrexian Revoker

+1 Notion Thief

+1 Zur's Weirding

+1 Blue Elemental Blast

+2 Surgical Extraction

+1 Duress

+1 Maelstrom Pulse

-4 Abrupt Decay

-1 Daze

-1 Jace, the Mind Sculptor

-1 Sylvan Library

-1 Hymn to Tourach

3-1

**Round 5 - Sneak and Show**

I keep a hand with a Hymn and 2 Thoughtseizes in the dark and my opponent mulls to 5 so it's a fairly easy game 1. Game 2 ends with him staring down lethal on board and an upkeep Dimir Charm to keep him from top decking a sneak attack for the win.

For sideboarding see above.

4-1

**Round 6 - Adam Jensen with Sneak and Show**

I have a bitter sweet feeling sitting down across from Adam as we're friends and I know what he's on with my last 2 rounds proving that isn't good for him. The match plays out like the previous two, I took it down in 2 and added another knotch to my show and tell belt.

I sideboard similarly to the previous two matches except I boared out the 2nd daze over the Hymn because I know Adam plays simian spirit guides. 

5-1

**Round 7 - Camera match with Brian Braun-Duin running Death Blade**

Getting called over to the camera after losing round 1 is a good feeling, sort of like a rags to riches story. You can watch the match [here](www.twitch.tv/scglive/b/405522193?t=9h3m55s) if you so desire. Game 1 I win the mana screw war with a wasteland and a big-ol-goyf. Game 2 I keep a slow hand and get Jaced. We have a very grindy game 3 trading blows outs back and forth. I look pretty dead being hell bent vs a stoneforge and a batterskull then being the professional that I am flip a Lilly to bob and draw a decay for the turn and instantly take control of the game. BBD puts up a fight but I eventually take this one down in 3.

My side boarding went as follows:

+1 Nihil Spellbomb

+1 Notion Thief

+2 Engineered Plague

+1 Umexawa's Jitte

+1 Maelstrom Pulse

-2 Daze

-2 Baleful Strix

-2 Thoughtseize

6-1

**Round 8 - Win and in match with Lauren Nolan with Death Blade**

After doing some tie breaker math with Jeff Hoogland I cannot draw in due to being paired down so I have to play. Game 1 Lauren gets a little greedy and runs out two Bob's. I have no answer for either of them so I just start trying to race with a Strix. Lauren gets pretty lucky and flips 3 lands in a row at &lt;5 life and the game slips out from under me when he gets a jace and shaman online. Game 2 I keep a creature heavy hand and lead with a Thoughtseize into a hand with 3 Swords to Plowshares. Lauren draws into a Jace first and locks the game up.


My side boarding went as follows:

+1 Nihil Spellbomb

+1 Notion Thief

+1 Umexawa's Jitte

+1 Maelstrom Pulse

-2 Daze

-2 Thoughtseize

6-2

I felt a little bummed losing my win and in but Laurens a good player and ended up winning the whole thing so I can't feel to bad. All 3 of the legacy players in our car landed in the top 20 so I'd say it was a pretty successful weekend overall. In my last report I got asked to explain some card choices so I'll address those here.

* Dimir charm

I wanted another removal spell in my main deck but I didn't want another dead card against combo. So I tried this little gem out and its been nothing short of stellar for me ever since I sleeved it up a few opens ago. It hits the a lot of relevant creatures in the form of Bob, Stoneforge Mystic, Deathrite Shaman, etc. Also it counters many combo pieces such as Show and Tell, Natural Order, Time Spiral, etc. It is just an extremely versatile card which is what you want in this format. 

* Tombstalker

These bad boys are a nod to the punishing fire decks. If you take a look at my creature suite I have a pretty hard time keeping anything on the board vs a fire deck. They also do some work in the BUG mirror since 8 CMC does a pretty good job of dodging abrupt decay. 

* Zur's Weirding

I originally saw this card in Adrian Sullivan's [deck list](http://sales.starcitygames.com//deckdatabase/displaydeck.php?DeckID=55010) from Milwaukee and thought it was pretty interesting. I ended up having a discussion with Adrian about the card and thought I'd give it a shot. This card is pretty amazing as it allows you to completely stabilize vs a combo deck. After you pick their hand clean slamming this on the table is just game, you lock your opponent out of relevant draws for the rest of the game and play with perfect information. 

* No Force of Will

For awhile I was running 2 forces out of the board and was never really impressed with them just running them out of a sense of obligation. In my experience a proactive strategy and making your combo opponent deal with what you're doing first instead of the reverse is the most effective. Also just adding a dash of force of will isn't going to win me a counter war versus a deck designed to that like sneak and show so I just avoid the fight entirely. with 10 of my last 17 rounds of legacy being versus combo since I made the cut and losing one match to sneak and show after some mulls to 4 I'd say it was a good cut.

* Changes going forward

I was pretty happy with how the deck performed as a whole. The only changes I'm making at the time being is my Jitte is coming out in place of a Jace Belern and a Hymn out for an Inquisition in. The Tombstalkers may also prove unnecessary going forward as the number of punishing fire decks is decreasing. I would like to try out a pernicious deed in my sideboard in place of one of them.

-1 Hymn to Tourach

+1 Inquisition of Kozilek

-1 Umezawa's Jitte

+1 Jace Beleren / Jace, the Mind sculptor (to be decided)

**Match one vs Mason playing Grixis Control.**

Game one:

 I lose the dice roll and keep a hand of Champion, Mayor, Boros Elite, Experiment, Lightning Mauler, Cavern, and Sacred Foundry. This game was pretty uneventful as he wasn't able to get on his feet he played one Dreadbore and one Tragic Slip the entire game.

Game two:

Side out x3 Searing Spear, x1 Ghor-Clan Rampager. Side in 2x Domri Rade, 2x Boros Charm

I keep a hand of Experiment, Mayor, Lightning Mauler, Burning-Tree, and three lands. I get in a lot of damage early on and he goes all the way down to four before he manages to miracle a bonfire on his turn four for 2 which sweeps my board. I drop Thalia and pass turn he drops Olivia and proceeds to take control of the game.

Game three:

Side out 3x Boros Elite. Side in 3x Searing Spear(I hadn't seen any creatures game one and thought he was on a no creature mill deck)

I keep a hand of Champion, Burning-Tree, Mayor, Experiment, and three land. I drop turn one Champion, his turn he plays a tapped Watery Grave and passes. I drop Burning-Tree into Mayor and swing for four. His turn he plays a Dragonskull Summit  and Dreadbores my Champion. I draw a Lightning Mauler play Experiment, Lightning Mauler evolve the Experiment pair with Mauler and swing for ten. He untaps draws looks at his hand for a second and scoops.

Record 1-0

**Match two vs Josh playing RG aggro.**

Game one:

I lose the dice roll and end up having to mulligan my first two hands due to five lands in hand one with a Ghor-Clan and Frontline Medic and in the second hand I had no lands. I keep my five which consists of Champion, Mauler, Frontline, Cavern, and Stomping Ground. He proceeds to blow me out this game  due to turn three Reckoner and turn four Hellrider.

Side in 3x Nearheath Pilgrim 2x Ghor-Clan Rampager. Side out 4x Boros Elite 1x Flinthoof Boar

Game two I keep my hand with Champion, Mayor,  2x Nearheath, and three lands. My opponent has a Pillar of Flame for my first three creatures and then a spear for the last one. I drew only lands for the rest of this short match.

Record 1-1

**Match three vs Anthony playing Wolfrun Bant.**

Very uneventful match he won the dice roll Game one he took over the board early with an Augur of Bolas into Supreme Verdict Then Thragtusk hit followed by Resto Angel and the game was quickly over. 

I don't remember my sideboard choices for this game but I probably brought in Boros Charm, Domri and the two Ghor-Clan.

Game two I had turn one Champion turn two Burning-Tree into Mauler and a turn three Thalia to prevent a turn three verdict for him after his turn two farseek.

Game three he mulled down to four. He never made it past two lands and the match was over.

Record 2-1

**Match four vs Aaron playing RG aggro.**

Game one I lost the dice roll again and he drops a turn one Stromkirk Noble. I play a Sacred Foundry and Champion of the Parish. Turn two he plays a Flinthoof Boar and swings for one. I play a Mayor and pass. He untaps leaves back his boar and swings for two with Noble then cast a Reckoner. I don't really recall the next few turns, but neither of us was able to attack effectively. I managed to get a Boar out so he had to stop swinging with his Noble until he got a Spear or Ghor-Clan and he was trying to stonewall until he got an answer. I managed to flip my mayor early and start making tokens and then got out a Frontline medic later in the game. We had a stalemate on the board for several turns where if either player were to swing all out the other player could block live and counter swing for lethal. The stalemate ended when I managed to draw a Ghor-Clan. I swing all out and make my 8/8 Champion a 12/12 his Reckoner wasn't enough to save him from lethal.

Side in 3x Nearheath Pilgrim, 1x Ghor-Clan Rampager. Side out 4 Boros Elite

Game two we both got in some early attacks but he wasn't able to draw burn for my Nearheath Pilgrims I was swinging every turn with Frontline paired with Nearheath and a Burning-Tree. He thought he had lethal at one point when he top decked a hellrider dropped it turned his creatures sideways and said game. I had to tell him to wait so I could cast my Searing Spear before he could declare attackers. After that my lifegain was too much for him to deal with as he slowly lost life and creatures while I gained life.

Record 3-1

**Match five vs Jimmy playing UWR Flash.**

Game one he managed to land a Reckoner and then a second Reckoner after he burns my first two threats. I managed to take the game when I had double Ghor-Clan pump on my Mayor and Experiment One on turn four to take out his two Reckoners.

Side in x2 Domri, x2 Ghor-Clan, x2 Boros Charm

Game two he mulligans to five and I have a champion turn one with double Burning-Tree into Mayor on turn two. The match was quickly over.

Record 4-1

**Match 6 vs Alex playing Jund midrange.**

The first game was very long with him getting two bonfires to wipe the board but not finding any threats to close out the game. I was able to draw into enough threats to pull out a win even after he cast two Thragtusk. Swinging with a Frontline Medic and two other creatures each turn made his Thragtusks into chump blockers.
Side in 2x Domri Rade 2x Ghor-Clan Rampager 2x Boros Charm. Side out 4x Flinthoof Boar 2x Boros Elite.

Game two he had removal for my early creatures, I managed to turn three play the Burning-Tree that I had just drawn into Domri Rade. He still hadn't cast a creature yet. His turn he plays a Vampire Nighthawk and passes turn without seeing a land. I pass turn holding a spear in my hand. On his turn he swings at Domri and I spear his Nighthawk. He passes turn again missing his fourth land. At this point I haven't revealed a creature yet with Domri. On my turn I play Frontline Medic and attack for two with Burning-Tree. He never managed to get a fourth land although he did get plenty of removal except no Abrupt Decay. I end up using Domri's ultimate and swing for lethal on the same turn.

Record 5-1

Match 7 vs Eddie playing Junk Reanimator

Game one I manage to bring him down to seven life before he resolves an Unburial Rites on an Angel of Serenity, he quickly takes over the game at this point.

Side in 2x Domri Rade, 2x Ghor-Clan Rampager. Side out 3x Searing Spear, 1x Flinthoof Boar.

Game two this game was too long for me to completely recall the plays but I did miss several triggers this game I missed a Mayor flip, a flipped Mayor's token trigger and the evolve on Experiment from a flipped Mayor's token. I still managed to pull out the win here as he never saw an Angel of Serenity and I was able to build a gigantic army of creatures that were swinging every turn with Frontline Medic.

Game three I manage to get a quick start on him and he never reaches a fourth land to drop the three Thragtusks he was holding in his hand.

Record 6-1

**Match 8 vs Rob playing Wolfrun Bant.**

Game one I was able to take him down to five before he resolved a Verdict and landed a Centaur Healer and Thragtusk he won shortly after landing the Thragtusk.

Side in 2x Domri-Rade, 2x Ghor-Clan Rampager, 2x Boros Charm.

Game two I had a turn one Champion, turn two Burning-Tree into Mayor of Avabrook. He played a turn two Farseak getting a second white land. I drop a turn three Thalia and he scoops up his cards as he can't play the Verdict in his hand before I hit him for lethal.

Game three I had the best hand of the night. Turn one I drop a Champion, Turn two I drop three Burning-Tree into Mayor of Avabrook. Swing with Champion for which gets Charmed back to the top of my deck. His turn three he drops a land and Detention Spheres my three Burning-Tree, suddenly my awesome hand looks pretty sad. I drop my Champion and swing with Mayor for one. He untaps drops a Detention Sphere on my Mayor, and passes turn without getting a land drop. He proceeds to miss land drops for five turns in a row while I rebuild my army and swing in for lethal.

Record 7-1 


**Top 8 sixth seed vs third seed Cameron playing “Sunny Jund”**

My first top 8 opponent was playing a Jund deck splashing white for Restoration Angel since we're in the top 8 and he had a higher seed he went first. The first game was I managed to bring him down to four with a Frontline Medic a Flinthoof Boar and a Boros Elite swinging in every turn. He was at 2 red lands when I dropped a second Frontline Medic to make sure I could swing for lethal if he miracle cast a Bonfire. Sadly he top decked a Stomping Ground went to 2 and overloaded a Missium Mortars. He then dropped a Thragtusk followed by an Olivia which quickly ended the game.

Side in 2x Boros Charm, 2x Domri Rade, 2x Ghor-Clan Rampager. Side out 2x Boros Elite 4x Flinthoof Boar.

Game two I kept my initial seven of 2 Searing Spear, Frontline Medic, Domri Rade and three lands. He was forced to mulligan to five. He did have some kill spells for my creatures but had trouble dealing with Domri. He did land two Restoration Angels one of which took out my first Domri. I was able to swing with Frontline Medic which he chose not to block fearing a Ghor-Clan which I did have and used to pump my Frontline Medic. Second main phase I dropped Domri and had my Frontline fight his Restoration Angel. I was able to take over the game at that point.

Game three I was able to quickly take over the game. I dropped a Thalia on turn three and he dropped a Nighthawk on turn four. I swung with my Thalia on the next turn and he blocked with Nighthawk. I pumped with Ghor-Clan to take it out. He thin drew into only land instead of anything to stabilize and the match was over.

Record 8-1

**Semi-Finals vs second seed Keith playing Jund Midrange.**

Game one was long and drawn out he had a Nighthawk out swinging and gaining life while he was playing Huntmaster, Thragtusk. I wasn't able to get enough damage in during this game.

Side in 2x Domri Rade, 2x Ghor-Clan Rampager, 2x Boros Charm. Side out 2x Boros Elite, 4x Flinthoof Boar.

Game two also went very long but I managed to pull out the win with a surprise Ghor-Clan followed by Boros Charm for lethal when he was at 10 life.

Game three he had to mulligan to five and wasn't able to respond to the threats I was playing the game ended fairly quickly and I was on to the finals.

Record 9-1

**Finals vs Chris playing GB Predator Ooze**

Game one we both mulligan to five. He starts first since he's the higher seed, this game he wasn't able to drawn into a real threat he only had two mana dorks with a rancor and drew into land instead of the Ooze he was looking for. I was able to swing in for lethal after a few turns.

Side in 2x Fiend Hunter, 2x Ghor-Clan Rampager, 2x Domri Rade Side out 3x Thalia, 1x Searing Spear
Game two I keep my seven he goes down to six. he plays a land and passes. I drop a turn one champion. His turn two he plays a land and passes. His turn two he plays another land and passes turn, I drop Burning-Tree into Mauler and swing for seven. He plays a third land and drops Predator Ooze and passes, I drop a Fiend Hunter on Ooze and swing for eight. He looks at his hand for a second and concedes the game.

With most of my league players in the GPT, I decided to throw caution to the wind, and build something I saw as a ""fun to play"" brew that I had been kicking around. With some input from a few people, I cobbled together a RUG spalsh black control deck that was mainly a collection of cards I just felt like jamming that day.

What followed was a tear through the swiss and elimination rounds, where the only game I lost all day was to a mull to 4 against aristocrats, where I kept a 1-lander and didn't draw another.  Over the course of the day, I went up against a nice spread of different decks, Aristocrats, Naya Blitz, Junk Rites, Wolf Run Bant, and Esper (though more of a mid-rangy list, with Sorins and Geists in the main).

Nicol Bolas, Planeswalker - I'll start off with the most unorthodox card in the list.  For a while, I used to play Omnidoor, and the most fun I had with the deck was slamming down a Nicol Bolas.  Ever since I started experimenting with control decks, Bolas was always on my mind.  After a failed bant attempt, I made a 5-color list that topped out with Bolas, and while it was strong, the mana made it inconsistent. I knew that this deck could easily support him for late-game situations, and the addition of black allowed me to also support the next card.

Abrupt Decay - To put it simply, it kills most of the biggest problem creatures that I assumed I'd face off against.  There is quite a bit of Naya and Jund aggro in my meta, and this kills off most of what I'd face against.  It also conveniently takes out Boros Reckoner without any additional damage to my face.  It was the weakest card in the main deck in half my matches today, but those where it shined it was great.

Mizzium Mortars - Overloading this card just feels dirty.  Yesterday during the SCG I heard (I believe) Cedric Philips describe it as ""Plague Wind that has a Terror stapled on to it"". And that's absolutely true. If you need it, it can kill just about any dude you'll see across from you.  But if you can overload it, the game swings quickly in your favor.

Prime Speaker Zegana - After experimenting with Prime Speaker Bant, I knew this card was powerful, but I always saw it as a ""not as good Spinx's Revelation"".  Once I cut white from my list, this card started to show just how great it was.  With counterspells not as popular, this is a great body that refills your hand.  And much like any other great card in the current format, it goes great with Thragtusk.

Izzet Staticaster - I can assure you that without Staticaster, I doubt I would have been able to do as well as I did against Naya Blitz and Aristocrats.  While it was neigh-worthless in several matchups, it did serve as a surprise blocker or more than one occasion, as well as help clear the way in the Junk Rites match when my opponent kept a land-light hand with triple Avacyn's Pilgrim.  Clearing away lingering souls tokens, as well as making combat difficult for just about any deck, made this card an all-star, despite it being nothing more than a chump blocker in a few instances.

All in all, I was very satisfied by the way the deck worked.  If push comes to shove, I'm prepared to cut the black, and replace the abrupt decays and nicol bolas with more relevant threats (perhaps Yeva, for more flash run, or maindeck counterflux?) but it's performance today leads me to believe I'm on to something.

What do you guys think? Have you had any luck testing out similar RUG control decks? Any cards I happen to be forgetting exist (as this WAS put together using just what I happened to have on hand, as I was too lazy / constrained by time to do thorough research before the tournament started).",,False,,t5_2utkz,False,,,True,t3_1aybt6,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/1aybt6/standard_rug_control/,

1362321064.0,25,self.spikes,19ks1s,[Modern] Toronto March 2 PTQ report (Top 4) with UG Infect,35,10,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/19ks1s/modern_toronto_march_2_ptq_report_top_4_with_ug/,"I was playing UG Infect for the day. I woke up at 07:20, had breakfast at Timmy's and headed over to the event site. On the Jane bus there were at least three other Magic players.

181 players showed up for 8 rounds of swiss. The prize payout is absolutely bonkers. Kudos to 401 Games for that. They paid out to top 24! 24th went home with a half box.

My decklist is as follows:

Main Deck

* 4 Vines of Vastwood
* 3 Apostle's Blessing
* 1 Dispel
* 1 Dismember
* 4 Might of Old Krosa
* 4 Mutagenic Growth
* 4 Rancor
* 4 Groundswell
* 3 Noble Hierarch
* 4 Ichorclaw Myr
* 4 Glistener Elf
* 4 Blighted Agent
* 4 Inkmoth Nexus
* 2 Pendelhaven
* 1 Island
* 2 Forest
* 3 Breeding Pool
* 4 Verdant Catacombs
* 4 Misty Rainforest

Sideboard

* 2 Pithing Needle
* 2 Spellskite
* 2 Spell Pierce
* 2 Dispel
* 2 Nature's Claim
* 1 Distortion Strike
* 1 Vendilion Clique
* 1 Dismember
* 1 Torpor Orb
* 1 Grafdigger's Cage



**Round 1**

My Round 1 opponent, was on UWR (I think). I forgot to notate his decktype at the time and I wrote it down after the fact.

Game 1

Sometimes Infect nickel-and-dimes the opponent and sometimes they kill them in big chunks. This was the nickel-and-dime approach. He gained a bunch of life off Kitchen Finks and hit me down a bunch but he still fell to the poison.

Game 2

Turn 1 Noble Hierarch into turn 2 infect guy plus Rancor. This is very difficult to beat with all the protection my deck has. It was a quick one and he didn't do much.

1-0

**Round 2**

My opponent here, David ""Cappy"" Caplan is playing Splinter Twin. I know it's not a good matchup because he has the possibility of simply killing me with his draw step.

Game 1

I squeak out game 1 with big chunks of his infect going away and then we're on to game 2.

Game 2

I mulligan to 6. This is the kind of game that can be frustrating. He's at 8 infect with lethal on board for me and he hits his Splinter Twin enchantment without me having an answer.

I had a proactive answer for his Spellskites in the form of an early Pithing Needle but it wasn't enough to save me.

Game 3

He lands turn 2 Spellskite and I don't draw an answer in time so I'm on the nickel-and-dime plan. He beats me down with his army of tempo creatures (which he seemingly has an endless army of on my turn) and while at 4 infect he shows me Kiki-Jiki. I had a Nature's Claim as my next draw step but it didn't matter; Cappy showed me two Dispel in hand. His win was well protected. He would have killed me with his creatures before I managed to kill him with infect at that rate anyways.

1-1

**Round 3**

This is up against a RB Burn deck, which isn't the best matchup for me, but sometimes they can make the mistake of using instant speed burn spells which works out in my favour.

Game 1

I win the die roll and mulligan to 6. I have early lethal on board and in hand. My opponent swings in with a Goblin Guide. I flip Might of Old Krosa, opponent ships turn and I draw the Might off the Guide and then a Groundswell. Game loss, DEC. I simply wasn't paying attention to what was going on and caught a game loss for it and rightly so. My opponent called me out and said ""You drew an extra card!"" I objected, counted my hand and objected again, then realized I had played an Inkmoth Nexus and accepted the Game Loss fate and learned to pay attention no matter how dead my opponent is.

Game 2

I 9-spot him early in the game and then he has no answer. Easy win.

Game 3

He keeps a one-lander for some reason on 7 cards and never gets there. I whack him for 7 and then he scoops when he realizes he's dead on board.

I had so much protection this match between Dispel, Spell Pierce and Vines/Apostle's Blessing. He commented game 2 that I had the clutch Spell Pierce to punish a Searing Blaze and again a Dispel for a Searing Blaze in game 3. I accept the early win, feel bad for DEC and crushing my opponent and move on with the slip.

**Round 4**

I know my opponent personally, I've driven with him to Grand Prix events and played with him at the LGS. He's a good kid and has a lot of potential in Magic. Today he's piloting Resto-Pod. I comment that I don't think I can ever win this match in a million years because of Melira and Spellskite.

Game 1

I am on the play and lead off with a Noble Hierarch, my opponent does the same. My followup is much better with an infect creature. My play is met with a Birthing Pod. At this point I'm thinking that I have a turn to kill him or draw Dismember because he's going to pod his Hierarch into Melira and then I'm boned.

That doesn't happen and instead I smack him for 7, he pods into something irrelevant(!) and I kill him when I untap.

2-1

Game 2

He sideboards a bunch of cards and I bring in my Pithing Needles, Torpor Orb, Dismember.

He starts. I lead with an early Needle on Spellskite and have Dismember in my opening 6. I feel very good about this game and feel that I have it absolutely locked up.

He paths my guy which ramps me into more mana to use in protecting and buffing my team.

I land a Torpor Orb and endure the beatdown from his creatures until I start taking large chunks out of his infect life. 0 to 3 to 7 to dead.

After the match he tells me that he doesn't play Melira at all. I didn't realize that Resto-Pod had cut Melira entirely from their list! I guess now they are all-in on the Kiki-Jiki plan and don't feel the need to board in Meliras.

3-1

**Round 5**

This round my opponent is on Affinity/Robots. I win the die roll and we crack on.

Game 1

I'm on the play and lead off with a threat. He barfs a bunch of artifacts on the table and I realize he's doing basically the same thing as me but with creature damage.

I get the impression that he isn't very familiar with the Infect archtype since he reads a bunch of cards. This will lead to his downfall.

He quickly starts throwing his creatures in front of my attackers and they all die. He goes to block with an Ornithopter and use a Welding Jar on it and I comment ""that doesn't work the way you think it does."" He calls a judge over to confirm and just throws the `Thopter away, leaving up the Welding Jar. -1/-1 counters are a fickle mistress.

He runs out of effective blockers and I'm able to start connecting for huge chunks of damage: 5 infect and then dead.

Game 2

He starts out on 7 while I head to mulligan town and pick up 6 good ones.

He does something irrelevant and I turn 1 Pithing Needle Cranial Plating which basically guarantees that I'm going to win the quick race. He lands turn 2 Etched Champion and I follow up with Blighted Agent. He has a read, asks if it flies (I say that it does not fly) and then seems to lose interest in it.

I untap and ten-spot him. He seems very surprised that his Etched Champion can't block and the match is over.

He looked very dejected and the match was over very quickly. I don't think he expected my deck to be able to just untap and kill him even though his deck is aiming to do the same thing. Let it be a lesson: FULLY READ the cards your opponents play if you're not familiar with it.

4-1

**Round 6**

I'm up against a SWEET Boros Landfall deck. I won't say too much since I know the deckbuilder (my opponent) and I think he wants to keep it under wraps.

Game 1

I win the dice roll and start on the play. I score another ten-spot and he's dead.

Game 2

He whoops me good without me landing any infect damage. This very rarely happens.

Game 3

He goes all in on a plan of attack and I have the clutch Dispel and he's now without a board position, empty handed, and then I topdeck a pump spell to go from 6 to 10 infect. We shake hands, marvel at his deck and then hand in my slip.

5-1

**Round 7**

Going into this round I am in 4th place with the best tiebreakers of the 15 pointers. If I win I can very likely draw round 8 and make it into top 8. But first I need to get through a Jund deck.

Game 1:

This game is pretty fucking miserable because of an unpleasant judge call. I have my opponent at 9 infect and dead when I untap and he has me dead on board, if he does the right things.

He turns his attackers sideways, taps his Putrid Leach and says ""pump"" and then realizes he needs to animate the Treetop Village to make it lethal, otherwise it's just 9. He then untaps his attackers and I call a judge. I appeal the floor judge's ruling (go back to 1st main) and the head judge overturns (we're in declare attackers).

My opponent did not understand that once we're in Declare Attackers and he is nominating attackers that it is too late to animate the manland and turn it sideways. I won the game but felt super bad about it. Talking with people after the match they bring up that on Modo there's no takebacksies in this regard. We're playing a match to determine who can draw into top 8 and earn a trip to the Pro Tour; these tournaments are designed to reward players with a superior rules knowledge and even though it felt bad in this regard that is what happened.

Game 2 

He gets it done even after I pre-emptively needle Spellskite. Should have been Liliana. He's up to 5 poison but his discard rips my hand apart.

Game 3

I'm on the play and my opponent mulligans quite a bit. He's unable to interact and I kill him. He signs the slip and I GTFO as soon as possible.

6-1

**Round 8**

I'm in 5th place. My buddy hopped me by 1% on breakers and stole 4th. I'm sitting with the 3rd place seed due to 3rd and 4th having played already. We agree to draw and 4th, 5th and 6 place head to Subway for food. I have a Club on Parmasian Oregano with lettuce, tomato, pickle, and onion with mustard (not toasted, obv) and pick up a bottle of water. I vanquish my opponent while 4th seed was defeated, getting a bag to take leftovers away. We head back and pop some gum to not offend our top 8 opponents.

6-1-1


**Top 8**


I'm playing against Jund again. He's a higher seed and is on the play, exactly what Infect does not want!

Game 1

I steal this game which is absolutely clutch. He kept a hand of discard spells and one swamp(!?!) knowing that I was on infect. He lands a Deathrite and I'm able to get through for enough infect with him shocking me from 20 to 10 with Deathrite.

I see that he's on maindeck Olivia Voldaren and Profane Command! I obviously fold to Olivia but I had 2 Hierarchs and Pendelhaven plus an Inkmoth. He was forced to block with Olivia while at 7 infect to stop the 4/5 Inkmoth and revealed Profane Command the next turn to kill a Hierarch and resurrect Olivia. It didn't matter because he had to throw Olivia away again to stop the 3/4 Inkmoth. A quick Judge call here to verify Exalted and the new trigger rules and he quickly scooped.

Game 2

I mulligan once again down to 6 and get him up to 6 infect. He flips a bolt to Bob, has Deathrite. Attacks and I let it through going to 4. Bolt plus Deathrite finish me off. There was no point in attacking. I was empty handed and his bolt just kills my only attacker and I'm still dead.

Game 3 

Infect on the play with a full grip is not good.

I alter my opening sequence and lead off with a Glistener Elf instead of Hierarch as I'd done game 1 and 2. I've got a good hand and feel confident that I can kill him quickly.

He goes to 3 infect and then 8 and then I'm in the top 4.

After the match he consults with his friends about his keeps and lines of play. In the end he was unable to disrupt my plan in game 3.

7-1-1

1361219465.0,28,self.spikes,18rrhz,[Standard] Evolving Wolf-Run Bant,32,4,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/18rrhz/standard_evolving_wolfrun_bant/,"As a Bant player, I was really excited to see Melissa Detora kick so much ass at PT GTC. I've been incredibly intrigued by the archetype since it broke into the format after the SOM rotation, and I finally bought into it after Reid Duke's incredible performance at the SCG Invitational in December of 2012.

Prior to this weekend, I was running this list (except two Blind Obedience in the side over Loxodon Smiter):

[Mike Mahaffey's Bant Control](http://magic.tcgplayer.com/db/deck.asp?deck_id=1093834)

And here's Detora's deck if you haven't seen it:

[Melissa Detora's Wolf-Run Bant](http://www.decklists.net/index.php?option=com_ohmydeckdb&amp;controller=deck&amp;view=deck&amp;deckId=16927)

Mahaffey's list was better than Reid Duke's list because of its acceleration, versatility, and increased board presence. I piloted it at SCG Edision to a rather unimpressive 4-5 finish. Some cards were severely underperformed that day, namely Jace, Architect of Thought. Prime Speaker Zegana is powerful, but underwhelming on her own. 

The most important thing Melissa Detora picked up on was the need for Kessig Wolf-Run. I didn't like just sitting there with Drownyard as my Plan B. Kessig Wolf-Run generates insane value on one creature, and it has Farseek to back it up. I love Alchemist's Refuge, but I see why she cut it. You should be able to commit your spare change to getting there with Wolf-Run.

So, after seeing Detora's list in action, I decided to give it a whirl at an SCGIQ yesterday. With no prior testing, I 4-0-2'd the Swiss and took 5th overall (losing a heartbreaker to Jund Aggro in Game 3 in the quarter-finals). 

For reference, I played against:

- Naya Humans, 2-0
- Humanimator, 2-1
- Jund, 2-1
- Jund, 2-1
- Round 5 was an intentional draw
- Round 6 was an intentional draw
- Jund Aggro, 1-2 (my game 2 loss was to a very questionable keep^1, and there wasn't much I could've done in game 3)

1 - Over-confidence in hands during Game 2 coming off a win is a major weakness of mine

Here are some highlights:

- Swinging in with Gisela, Blade of Goldnight at 18/5 (one-shotted at a Jund player who was sitting at a comfortable 36). 

- Holding a Kessig Wolf-Run against another Jund player who admitted (for some reason) to not knowing what I was playing. He put me in the red zone thinking I could only punch back for 3 with a Beast token. I dropped the Wolf-Run and charged in for lethal. 

- Letting a Humanimator player pack his graveyard because he knew I was holding a Supreme Verdict, only to blow it all away with a Rest in Peace (not necessarily something unique to this deck, but fun nonetheless).

- Beating a Naya Human player 62-0. 

**What I like:**

- A lot of things just feel right about Detora's list. At 25 land, and with 6-10 draw engines (plus the digging from Augur), I managed to avoid situations where land is an issue (either having too much or two little). I was able to keep plenty of two-land Farseek/Think Twice/Azorius Charm hands and not miss a land drop. 

- The sideboard is strong in a lot of match-ups. Humanimator, a deck which had previously given me issues, was a breeze. I went down a game simply due to not having an extra land for a Syncopate. Gisela, in particular, was fantastic. Witchbane Orb seems oppressive against Esper, and I think I like it more than Jace, Memory Adept. Gisela, Blade of Goldnight is incredibly spicy. 

**What I don't like:**

- 14 shocklands. I get that you want plenty of targets for Farseek, but sheesh. It makes aggro match-ups much more intense. Games against slower decks usually don't punish me for shocks.

- 3 Rhox Faithmender. It feels like a bit much. I'm happy to see him, for sure, but I can't help but feel like 2 should be enough for this deck. 

Moving forward, it's obvious that this deck has some staying power. I'm wondering where we can go from the basic list. I had a few thoughts:

- Huntmaster of the Fells. It feels very powerful in this archetype, but the presence of four additional red sources would turn this more into a Naya-Blue list. The value of flips and Angel blinks is very tempting, but his P/T on the front side means he's not as helpful in Aggro match-ups. 

- Garruk, Primal Hunter. He feels like a very strong sideboard choice. It seems likely that he'd take Garruk Relentless's place, and I think using one over the either depends on your read of an event's likely field. Triple green isn't an issue with this deck. 

- Feeling of Dread. This seems like a really good option for the decks that use Boros Reckoner aggressively (instead of the more combo-oriented UWR builds). Naturally, you can get over his head with Restoration Angel, but Feeling of Dread allows for bigger punches. It also seems very helpful against the RG/Naya Saito lists. 

- Angel of Serenity. I don't think the deck is screaming for this inclusion, but a single in the mainboard could add some versatility. 

Any thoughts?

1358355023.0,25,self.spikes,16ox4o,More Sam Black from his SCG Premium article today,35,10,52,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/16ox4o/more_sam_black_from_his_scg_premium_article_today/,"&gt;I've heard a lot of complaints about this Standard format, which is pretty surprising given its diversity and how consistently it's changed. On the surface, it appears to be one of the most balanced and well-rounded Standard formats ever. So why do people complain?

&gt;The objection has to be (I assume) in the actual game play or possibly the way decks are built generally. Decks and games rely far more heavily on single cards, with the last big monster standing spelling victory, and the synergies that decks are built around are loose things like ""Snapcaster Mage likes spells"" or ""play Restoration Angel with creatures that do things when they come into play.""

&gt;R&amp;D has made a conscious shift toward flashy cards that stand on their own and away from linear strategies, presumably because linear new cards that need other new cards to function have no appeal to casual players who are just buying a few packs to get new cards to add to their casual decks. As a result, deckbuilding is less about tuning a specific line and more about mashing all the best cards together. Basically, it's more likely that every deck will share a few cards regardless of what their plan is, which is why so many decks have Thragtusk and/or Restoration Angel.

&gt;This is to say that it's extremely unlikely that you'll play against someone who is playing the same deck as you, but it's extremely likely that your opponent will have the same card. This isn't a kind of lack of diversity Magic has experienced in such a widespread way before, and when it has, it was often because the card was just too good and needed to be banned like Skullclamp or Sensei's Divining Top. It's not too surprising that it's unpopular now because complaints have been pretty common in any format where there's some card that's in every deck.

&gt;I think people just don't have the language or structure to identify the fact that several cards are in half the decks to properly form complaints, but it may in fact be a problem. I think that if it is a problem, it's a systemic problem with how cards are made these days, so it will take a significant amount of time for it to change. While banning has been a possible solution in the past, calling to ban a card merely because every white deck plays it and half the decks have white mana is no longer a reasonable cause for banning because there are ten other cards that would do the exact same thing if it wasn't that card. Magic is just different now.

With Jund running Thundermaws, Lotus Cobras, and other more ramp-esque cards when put in the position of trying to get rid of a Deathrite Shaman it just seems awful to Path it. Storm loves the extra land from Path when you hit an Electromancer. Scapeshift it's a pretty dead card, UW Angels it's still decent against - but bad to run if you are running UW and Mana Leaks. It's still decent against Twin and Pod, but it seems to me that Path is becoming less and less 'the best removal in modern'.

The problem I've been having is that there doesn't seem to be the greatest replacement for it. Dismember is a valid option but it misses hitting important cards like Wurmcoil in Tron and has the (albeit unlikely chance) of whiffing against Goyf. But Goyf is the problem card here, most decks that run White can't effectively deal with a Goyf - on average I find that his P/T is for the most part 3/4. Meaning he is out of Bolt/Sunlance range. He's not exiled from Celestial Purge or any other type of Black/Red colour-hate card. 

I've been trying to find a card to replace it - what are people's thoughts on this issue? Have people been more and more hesitant to run Path in their W/X decks and is their another card to replace it?

I've been contemplating running [Vendetta](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Discussion.aspx?popularpage=1&amp;multiverseid=194922#popularPosts), [Devour in Shadow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=50210), [Dismember](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=230082) in addition to [Sunlance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=122355) for W/B colour combinations - but I'm not sure on other colours options. While these cards cost a massive amount of life, it may be better than the extra land.

I've done some other helpful articles before if you'd like to visit those!

[Steps to moving past being a ""new player"" into becoming a competitive player](http://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/qwg03/steps_to_moving_past_being_a_new_player_into/)
 
[Competitive Tournament Perparedness](http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/yrsh5/competitive_tournament_preparedness/)

**Pre-Sealed Preparation:**

1.) **Mentally Prepared** - Leave your baggage at home. Go for a walk/ jog in the morning if necessary to help to invigorate yourself and get your mind moving in a positive direction. Make certain you're not arriving late/hungry/hungover/etc. You don't want to deal with things like that throughout the day. Stay hydrated, keep snacks around (that won't affect cards/sleeves). I've gone over this one in my last installment, so not going to harp on it too much.

2.) **Bring Paper to Track Life, not Dice** - I'm a huge proponent of this. It allows you to jot quick notes throughout the game, it keeps a history of life total changes. Just a far better approach. Keep those spindowns for other things, like counters, etc.

3.) **Be Fresh to Death** - Everyone hates the negative connotation that surrounds geeks and nerds about being smelly, unsanitary, disgusting. The least you can do is make yourself presentable. You'll feel better throughout the day, and your fellow players will appreciate it.

**Registration / Sealed Pool Registration:**

(This area is for if you have to register a pool and turn it in.)

1.) **Write Name / DCI on the Pool you're Registering** - This is the pool that you're registering for someone else. Simple practice, but it can have huge implications if you don't do it. 

2.) **Count the amount of cards you're registering** - I do a double check: Make certain there's 84 in the pool and there's 6 rares (plus foils). It's the two most noticeable screw ups you can make so I prefer to not make either. Also list the cards from each color in alphabetical order for each color.You do not register the basic lands you open (unless they're foil). If you have a pool that for whatever reason you count isn't 84 cards, immediately call a judge (I've never encountered this: I presume it's incredibly rare).

3.) **Work in a Clean Space** - This is just to help you keep track of everything. A table riddled with lands, tokens, empty packs will get in the way and may hide cards. Take your trash, toss it into your pocket or an acceptable place off of the table.

**Deck Construction**

1.) **Write your name on the Deck Registration Sheet** - Pretty straight forward.

2.) **Go through your cards quickly and match them all to the Registration** - This is imperative. If someone lost a card you're only screwing yourself if you don't due diligence.

3.) **Count the Physical Cards, The Rares, and what's Present on the Sheet** - Again, imperative - Only person this hurts is you if you do not do so.

4.) **Once Deck is Built, Make certain Every Card is Registered as ""In Deck""** - Including your lands and how you have them distributed (i.e. 10 plains, 7 forests, etc). 

**Enough, Let's Play!**

1.) **De-Sideboard** - People more easily forget this when it's sealed than when it's standard. A product of Pre-Releases and Releases that are non-competitive (i.e. you don't de-sideboard the strong cards you have identified from playing).

2.) **While on Sideboard, Don't be Afraid to find Strong Game 2/3 Cards** - I Wrote down 3 cards and a land on a piece of paper I jammed into my box and what they replaced so I wouldn't have to think about between every match on Saturday. I wish I would've had them main board, but I didn't. Make certain you develop a sideboard plan as you progress through the tournament and write it down. It is not illegal to have something that informs you how to sideboard.

3.) **Be Vigilant on your triggers** - This one screwed me in a match and almost made me lose the round. Make certain you're being mindful of your own must and may triggers now more than ever. No more Lapsing Triggers, no more opponents being responsible for your must triggers, it can be easily abused against you (as it was against me).  

4.) **Shuffle Plenty** - No need to screw yourself into that fat stack of lands you had built up last round because you went to time.

**Woo! Top 8!**

1.) **Listen to the Head Judge on How You're to Draft** - It may vary if only slightly from location to location. For instance, they may have it all timed and you only pass after time has expired. They may ask that you adhere to the ""three zones"" (to your left, to your right, and in your hand) as the only 3 piles that may exist.

2.) **Go in with a Rough Strategy and be Willing to toss it out** - There're certain archtypes your comfortable in or are most suited to. While aim for them, be willing to be versatile. If you're strongest in Azorious, but you open a Trostani pack one, maybe you should be trying to get Selesnya. Or you're going for the Rakdos ""balls to the wall"" approach, but you're getting cut out of those strong drops or out of black all together, maybe you should see if another color is open.

3.) **Don't Talk to Anyone Until After the Deck is Registered** - And write your name on the paper :). 


**Final Thoughts**

1.) **This is a Hobby: Enjoy Yourself** - Seems contradictory, but I have a blast being very competitive. I don't let losses hang over me like a cloud. But I don't disregard them either. You need to learn from both wins and losses, and you need to not hate yourself in the process.

2.) **Disregard my Capitalization Throughout** - I'm getting sloppy in it as the day is almost over!",,False,,t5_2utkz,False,,,True,t3_11roe7,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/11roe7/tips_for_sealed_competitive_play/,

This is my first tournament report, and that’s because it is the first time I think I have something of value to contribute to a competitive discussion on Standard.

So, here’s why I brought a rogue deck to a PTQ:

As a spike, when you take a rogue deck to a competitive event, there had better be a good reason. After M14’s release, it was clear that the best decks in the format were Jund, Junk Aristocrats, and WB Humans/tokens variants. In addition, I knew that some players would attempt to poke a hole in greedy manabases with Burning Earth mono-red, and some players would rather die than play a deck that isn’t UWx control. After some thinking, I determined the cards that the majority of the decks were soft to: 

* Blood Baron of Vizkopa (Many decks simply cannot beat this card)
* Olivia Voldaren (a true powerhouse against swarms of tokens, can take over a game very quickly)
* Lifebane Zombie (a 2-for-1 in some matchups, and a 3/1 unblockable in many others)
* Pillar of Flame (Voice, Blood Artist, mana dorks, High Priest. Kills things dead)
* Bonfire of the Damned (should be self-evident)

That meant constructing a W/B/R midrange list to exploit the power of these cards and win games against unprepared opponents. The game plan of this deck is simple: survive for a while and then keep slamming powerful, hard-to-answer threats until you win. Cards that are particularly good at getting to the late game are Gloom Surgeon (yes, Gloom Surgeon), Vampire Nighthawk, and a wide variety of 2-mana removal spells. The majority of cards in this list are 2-ofs and 4-ofs. The 2-ofs often serve overlapping functions but are slightly better or worse in various matchups. The 4-ofs are generally fantastic overall. This led me to the following list:

Creatures:

* 2 Gloom Surgeon
* 2 Vampire Nighthawk
* 2 Lifebane Zombie
* 4 Boros Reckoner
* 2 Olivia Voldaren
* 4 Blood Baron of Vizkopa
* 2 Obzedat, Ghost Council

Spells:

* 4 Pillar of Flame
* 2 Ultimate Price (need to be able to answer Desecration Demon (thanks Jeff Hoogland))
* 2 Dreadbore
* 3 Warleader's Helix
* 2 Bonfire of the Damned
* 2 Rakdos's's's's Return

Artifacts:

* 2 Rakdos Keyrune

Land:

* 4 of each dual
* 1 Cavern of Souls

Sideboard

* 2 Ratchet Bomb
* 2 Barter in Blood
* 1 Celestial Flare
* 3 Lingering Souls
* 2 Thundermaw Hellkite
* 2 Appetite for Brains
* 3 Sin Collector


After much testing (including against the Junk 'Crats player who won the entire PTQ and the Jund player who got third (go LGS!)), I determined that this deck had positive matchups against Jund, Junk Crats, W/B humans/tokens, Domri Naya, and UWR midrange. It had neutral matchups against Mono Red and Mono Green Ooze. It had poor matchups against Esper control and Bant Hexproof. I was okay with this, and allotted heavy sideboard to Bant Hexproof. I hoped to dodge Esper Control. This leads us to the first round.

**Round 1: Esper Control**

So much for dodging Esper. My opponent was on a Planeswalker/Verdict heavy list, and he manged to boardwipe each set of two threats I committed to the board in Game 1. After 30 minutes, with him in a stable enough position, I conceded, knowing I needed to win two games. He boarded in his Curse of Death's Hold, which was surprisingly effective at shutting down my threats. Lots of my cards died on the spot, and 3/3 Blood Barons are much worse at clocking than 4/4s. 0-2 Loss. 

0-1

**Round 2: Jund**

I kept a slow hand game 1, and after keyrune turn 3, Bonfire his Huntmaster turn 4, and Blood Baron Turn 5, he Rakdoses the rest of my hand, slams a Thragtusk, and wipes the floor with me. Game 2, I did to him what he did to me Game 1. Game 3, I keep a faster hand and go under him with Gloom Surgeon, Vampire Nighthawk, 2 Helixes, and a timely Bonfire. 2-1 win

1-1

**Round 3: Bant Hexproof**

Game 1 he suits up a Turn 2 Geist and crushes me. Game 2, I land a turn 2 Ratchet Bomb, forcing him into suboptimal plays regarding his Invisible Stalker and Geist of Saint Traft. This stalls the game long enough for me to land 2 Blood Barons. 

Game 3 was definitely the most interesting game of Magic I played the entire day. I had a Reckoner on board, and had attacked once with it already. My opponent had a suited up Geist, Avacyn's Pilgrim, and Voice of Resurgence. I was looking pretty dead. I was holding a Barter in Blood, which was no good due to his Pilgrim. I decided to count the board's creatures (4), count my lands (5), and say ""Nine. Sweet. You're at 15?"" After he confirmed, I attacked immediately. Falling for my Blasphemous Act bluff, he blocked with his suited up Geist, and I threw the damage at his Pilgrim. Then I cast Barter in Blood, and easily won the game from there. 2-1 win.

2-1

**Round 4: U/W Humans**

It turns out that Nighthawk, Olivia, and Blood Baron eat this deck even more easily than W/B Humans. Easy 2-0 win.

3-1

**Round 5: Junk Aristocrats**

Game 1 was close, I managed to stabilize off of a miracled bonfire + lifelinking Blood Baron. Game 2 was exceptionally grindy, and came down to a board state of a 9/9 Unflinching Couraged Varolz against my two Blood Barons. After 25 minutes, I made a misplay and lost. Game 3, he got stuck on 2 Sunpetal Groves, and after Pillaring his Voice, I took the game home. 2-1 win.

4-1

**Round 6: Junk Aristocrats**

My opponent was a stronger player than my last opponent, and she surprised me by using an Archangel of Thune + Blood Artist to behave like an Arcbound Ravager for her board, negating the lifelink on my Blood Baron and pumping through to kill me. Game 2, I removed her threats one by one, including the Archangel the moment it came down. Someone watching the game said ""Wow, that's an aggressive Helix."" I asked him to leave. Game 3, I kept, on the draw, 4 land (Shock and 3 check with perfect mana, Reckoner, and 2 Blood Baron). She proceeded to Gavony up some Souls and took the game. 1-2 Loss

4-2

**Round 7: Domri Naya**

Although I was out of Top 8 contention, I was still in it for prizing. I easily won in two games by answering all of his cards with their hard counters. He after the games, he loudly complained that the games were bullshit and that my deck straight up beat his. I told him that is why I brought this deck. He told me it wasn't a real deck. I agreed. 2-0 win

5-2

**Round 8: Intentional Draw**

The PTQ gave prizing based on points, where 16 points was 6 packs and 18 points was 10 packs. It was positive EV to draw, so we did.

**Take away**

All in all, the deck felt sweet. It is easily modifiable to fit any your own metagame. I would probably remove the Nighthawks and Obzedats from the main deck (both in side), and add Lingering Souls + Blasphemous act. Cut Thundermaw entirely. He was too clunky and more easily-removable than the other threats in the deck. At its best, this deck was a pile of unbeatable cards. At its worst, it's a Jund deck without Farseek or Wolf Run. In reality, its power depends on how prepared your opponents are for Blood Baron.

Most people thought the deck was dead until the man himself, Mr Finkel showed up with a new storm list.  I think it's time we started discussing where this deck can go.

There is very little written about the new version, because for most part the deck seems less consistent, and we are about winning. 

Here are my reasons for wanting to play the deck, and thus enter in to discussions on lines and card choices:

1) Most people have stopped siding direct hate. This is a creature format, and the only card I see that is in boards that can effect us is counterflux (though that is a pretty good answer)

2) even the blue decks are running a ton of removal and only around 8 counters, four of them usually cost a good bit to cast (cryptic).

3) you can get free wins against the top tier decks, and if we can work on a solid list, do well games 2/3

Mainly, I'd like to discuss adding a third color, black for protection similar to the black version of twin or green for channel the suns or possibly all suns dawn( we have to be able to break that) , as well as what the new lines of play are now that we go off a turn or two later on average.

Edit: 
Here is a recent list that's done pretty well. Cards not in this list that get put in the flex spots (number of pyromancsers and the faithless lootings) are desperate ravings, peer through depths and increasing vengeance. I personally like at least one peer through depths as it can really dig for that card you need.

1374477194.0,25,self.spikes,1isrvg,[Standard]Esper Control Post M14,32,7,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/1isrvg/standardesper_control_post_m14/,"**Overview**

I have been playing Esper since RTR Standard and have tried a few different versions. It seems like there are a few variants that are all fine to play most of the time although some trump over others from time to time. 

For example GTC Standard Esper Cleansing performed well at the pro tour. This was because at the time Jund was probably the favorite going into the tournament and this deck was set up to beat Jund. It should also be noted that this was the first event The Aristocrats began to see play. Cats, even in its earliest form, had a great matchup for Esper Cleansing it was a good thing more people were not running it. Shortly after this tournament Junk Rites began to start dominating the format. Esper started playing midrange finishers like Obzedat and Sorin in order to stabilize and close out game quickly. This strategy stabilized against Naya Blitz decks and turned off Junk Angels. This version was never very popular, but it did place in large tourneys here and there. Finally as Junk Aristocrats started up in DGM along with Act II and Rg Aggro Esper decided to start mainboarding 4x Terminus to make the matchable winnable. Again Esper struggled in the format until right before M14 release.

Personally I always enjoyed playing the most controlling version possible. I always adapted my deck to the metagame, but it never felt as good as it did when it was run as Esper Cleansing. For this reason I enjoy playing the most pure control list as possible and it is a driving force behind the creation of my list. 

**Concepts**

Post M14 why are we playing Esper. To be honest I play it even when the deck is T2 at best, but I do believe it fits in the metagame right now. The reason you should try Esper is that it has a few key favorable matchups. First it is the best deck against Hexproof. Personally I don't think Hexproof got that much better with M14, but many do and that will mean it will see a ton more play early on in the meta. It is also the deck that has a hard time losing to UWR. Being the pure control list it never needs to resolve spells allowing all counters to be played reactively and always having mana open. It reacts to Rampager decks fairly well with instant speed removal like Charm and Doom Blade. With Rites pretty much out of the meta, that is one very unfavorable matchup that we can cross off our plate as well.

As I have said before I meant for this deck to play as a pure control list. Generally accepting the fact that winning a match 1-0 is completely fine helps this deck by giving it more answers and never needing to give up precious mana. Think of this deck having 2-3 mainboard win cons and those being Sphinx after stabilizing. Drownyard will eventually just win the game for you, don't force it.

This deck really is built with four decks in mind. Most importantly it wants to beat Jund. Secondly Hexproof must be a good matchup at least post board. And it needs to play well against Rg Aggo and UWR. Some choices on cards will seem bad vs other decks because they were not main considerations in the deck building process.

**Creatures**

2x Snapcaster Mage - 95% of the time this card says 1U - target instant in your library gains flashback. But sometimes it comes in end of turn and with some main phase removal it slows down Domri.

**Removal**

2x Doom Blade - Very good in most game 1's. at two mana allows you to play removal end of turn on turn two against aggressive decks when you would otherwise would have to untap and hold up mana for charm or away.

1x Warped Physique - I wouldn't fault anyone for running multiples, nor would I fault anyone for running none. For me this is targeted removal in game one that Doom Blade doesn't kill. It can be a dead card between turns five and eight or so some games so I like to only run one, but I am always happy to see it. It does kill things like Predator Ooze, Sire, Olivia, Falkenrath, and Blood Artist with ease, which is nice.

2x Far // Away - Kills all the black creatures. Sometimes it is a board wipe after a turn 4 Huntmaster. Sometimes it hits a mana dork and a geist. However most of the time I'm casting this it is just for the edict, which I'll gladly pay 1 colorless extra for the versatility.

1x Tribute to Hunger - This simply gains us life back sometimes. Definitely not a card I want to rely on early game, but after a board wips or killing Obzedat on upkeep is really nice to gain some life back in the midgame as we stabilize.

4x Azorious Charm - Sometimes this card is a time walk if they swing in for what they think is a free ping with a mana dork. Even just forcing an opponent to draw that reckoner or smitter without haste is great. I've seen so many players play around this card just because of the possible setback if they don't have a land in there hand for the next turn yet. It also works with drownyard once in a while to get rid of otherwise problem creatures like falkenrath.

**Card Advantage**

4x Think Twice - This has almost always been a four of in my deck and it didn't last as a three of very long the one time it was. I liked turn two think over Augur in probably 80% of my games. It gives card advantage as early as turn three and more importantly drawing one on turn five or six can help to refill your hand as you run out of answers. We also are not playing Augur anymore so this is a preferred turn two play.

4x Sphinx's Revelation - We are not one of the Sorin/Obzedat lists that wants to find our wincon and win behind it. We want to play this game forever. Running four over three allows us better chances of having one by turn seven or eight to close out the game and it also allows us to cast it on turn five or six when we need more cards and not feel bad.

**Counters**

4x Syncopate - This is why we are not playing Augur. This is better on the play than the draw because it does hit Farseek that way but with so many good two and three drops in standard (Farseek, Ooze, Burning-Tree, Thalia, Strangleroot Geist, Blood Artist, Flinthoof Boar, Geist of Saint Traft, Lingering Souls, Lilliana, and early Huntmaster) it is really nice running four because we will almost always have one early on to keep us alive until we can board wipe and later sphinx. Also running 27 lands means it will always work in our list, even when it might not be efficient.

2x Dissipate - This is much better late game. Countering a Thragtusk, Sphinx, etc without paying eight mana allows us to sphinx on the same turn. It is definitely worse in the early game so we play less of them.

**Board Wipes**

4x Supreme Verdict - I have always liked this much more than Terminus because it feels much more consistent. In certain matchups if I see it in my opening hand with a little more action I feel very safe. Terminus does not do that for me. Sure Verdict folds to Blood Artist, but it is much more consistant in many more decks, especially Hexproof.

2x Planar Cleansing - This deck was designed to beat Jund. What card destroys Jund? Planar Cleansing. It also has its merits against other annoying permenants like Witchbane Orb and Pithing Needle. It is really slow for Domri, keep that in mind.

**Planeswalkers**

1x Jace, Memory Adept - I've played without him more than I have played with him. He does make it possible to win a match 2-1 when otherwise it would end 1-1. Speeding up the first game in a series is definitely helpful if you have a favorable matchup but don't feel like drawing because you played second game two (Rg Aggro).

**Land**

4x Hollowed Fountain

4x Watery Grave

3x Godless Shrine

4x Glacial Fortress

4x Drowned Catacomb

4x Isolated Chapel

3x Nephalia Drownyard

1x Ghost Quarter

I decided to cut one shock instead of a check land because the two life can be relevant sometimes. It seems more likely to need two life in games I lose than to lose because a couple lands came in tapped before turn four. Three drownyard is plenty, painstakingly slow sometimes, but plenty. Ghost Quarters kills Kessig Wolf Run. Sometimes it kills Gavony as well. Rarely it does kills other things but most other lands I usually just let sit there.

**Sideboard**

1x Jace, Memory Adept - Either brought him against control or as desperation when the clock is running out in the round.

1x Curse of Echoes - I love this card although I would not fault anyone for ripping it out. Our list does not run any enchantments main deck. It runs 1 walker and only two ""creatures."" Game two it can catch  people off guard as they board out some of there removal. Even if they do leave in a little removal (one or two O-Rings, etc) you can usually protect it or Cleansing it away). If it sticks it is an auto win vs control more often than not.

1x Planar Cleansing - Vs Jund this card is amazing. Bringing in a third is crippling. 

2x Aetherling - Generally these come in vs control as well to give alternate, quicker win conditions. Having them in the mirror is essential, especially if they are playing four drownyards.

2x Doom Blade - Against aggro decks this card can be amazing so bringing two more in always feels good. 

2x Far // Away - This could easily be Devour Flesh. The point is this card adds in two additional edicts for Hexproof. Far // Away is better against more decks and against Hexproof it isn't much worse.

3x Appetite for Brains - This is left over from my DGM sideboard and will probably be trimmed down as the meta establishes itself. Right now it is amazing against Jund, but with Rites gone it could easily be trimmed down. I would probably lean towards something like Renounce the Guilds to deal with Domri and Act 2.

3x Rest In Peace - This is for our Aristocrats matchup. It does work if we see Rites but to be honest I'd rather play Purify the Grave against them. Right now however Rest In Peace shuts off Blood Artist, Voice of Resurgeonce dying ability, Young Wolf, Doomed Traveler, Geralf's Messenger, Snapcaster Mage, Elixir of Immortality, and Physic Spiral.

**Matchups**

**vs Jund** - We hope to see counter spells for Thratusk but we are okay charming his beast. Syncopating turn two Farseek can be really back breaking. Cleansing deals with all there walkers. Verdict a lot of the time will just be used as a single targeted removal spell, which is fine.

-2 Doom Blade

-3 Verdict

-1 Jace

+1 Cleansing

+2 Far // Away

+3 Appetite

**vs Aristocrats** - We pretty much auto lose game one. If we can keep Blood Artist off the table we may be okay but its doubtful. Bring in all the Rest In Peace and hope you see them. If not, this is a matchup we are okay losing.

-2 Doom Blade

-2 Snapcaster

-1 Dissipate

+2 Far // Away

+3 Rest In Peace

**vs Hexproof** - Game one can be tough but not unwinnable. Game two and three keep edicts and verdicts and it should be an easy win. Just remember to mulligan if needed and don't forget about mending touch.

-1 Doom Blade

-1 Warped Physique

-1 Jace

+2 Far // Away

+1 Planar Cleansing

**vs Aggro** - Use Syncopate and Doom Blade to keep you alive until you can verdict. Sideboarding can change depending on matchup. If no Domri feel free to take out Cleansings. if Wolf Run leave Ghost Quarter in. Jund Aggro, Doom Blade might stay out depending on creatures.

-2 Dissipate

-1 Ghost Quarter

-1 Jace

+2 Doom Blade

+2 Far // Away

**Dega Midrange** - Really good matchup for us. Sin Collector and Slaughter Games can be a true pain post board but with some many different answers and so many dead cards for them we should be good. Let the reckoners hit you in the early game or charm them to slow them down. Don't let Obzedat stick.

-2 Doom Blade

+2 Far // Away

**vs Control** - UWR you need to be careful about tapping out for Sphinx and being burnt. Bant you cannot underestimate how fast there deck can actually be post board. Play around with the board depending on the deck. Appetite can be good vs most some Bant lists. Doom Blade can be excellent vs Thundermaw lists. And Cleansing/Verdict should depend on the list (Smitter Heavy, Verdict/Assemble the Legion, Cleansing).

-3 Verdict

+2 Atherling

+1 Jace

The ability is west, but I don't know if its good enough on its own in any current deck. However, post rotation I think it will shine.

We currently have no good cantrips post rotation unless we get something in Theros. That means at worse quicken is a cycle card, which isn't terrible. This card will be decent in verdict decks once terminus rotates out as 5 man a board wipe will be better than a 4 man a board wipe in some situations (think board wipe after they play hellrider instead of the turn before of course there won't be hellrider, but its still killing one extra creature for a turn later). But playing it with only 4 scorceries is still just okay.

Where I see this card shining is in grixis. Grixis isn't a current deck, a lot of that has to do with all the scorcery speed cards. Just cards surviving rotation we have mizzium motors, dreadbore, rakdos return, and slaughter games. Being able to do any of those end of turn would allow the deck to play more counterspells and play a more flash game. Obviously this interaction just means the opponent has to respect instant speed things because you won't always play the instant speed game.

Round 6: Junk Reanimator  I win the die roll so I play land go t2 land go then when he attacks with his t1 dork I eat it with a Knight. I go t3 smiter t4 Angel t5 Hellkite and he dies. Yay quality curve outs! g2 I go t2 Smiter t3 Smiter only to get blown out by Sever again... -_- (That is the last time that weekend it happened). After that it's Slime time and I only have 3 lands so after he blinks it with Angel I scoop. g3 he has a t4 AoS but I went t2 Smiter into t4-3 Resto dont remember but I blinked my Smiter to save it from the angel Then stole his AoS with Conscripts off the top to kill him.

5-1

Round 7: Aristocrats! I dont how this matchup usually pans out but living long enough to go Resto Resto Tmaw Tmaw is good enough to win g1. G2 die to Aristocrat backed up by infinite doomed travelers and lingering souls, it feels gross to get mark of mutinied then eaten. G3 he keeps a one lander on the draw and never draws another while I curve out. He was fun to play against and we chatted it up during and after the game.

6-1

Round 8: UWR Control. This guy has beaten my friend John (who I mentioned in my Platinum report) and Jack who also came down so I have to win this. T2 domri on the play ranches him and restos allow me to apply pressure while stressing his mana in all directions, I still win even when he Terminuses off a Desolate Lighthouse on my turn because after my board rebuild he mistaps after mainphase loothouse to dig for verdict but  no WW open :P. g2 Mull to 5, I put up a good fight but after he slams assemble I draw Temple Garden instead of   the Thundermaw I need to kill him I scoop. g3 t2 Domri t3 resto just kinda kills him and I take it. I feel fantastic at this point it being my first constructed PTQ and being 7-1.

7-1

Round 9: Bant Hexproof. I am 6th in standings. This time I actually have the option to draw in without getting kicked to 9th place :P. After discussion with the rest of my team who are all out of contention for top 8 I decide to play because I feel it was the best way to win the whole thing (It would have given me 1st seed because the top 4 drew). I will discuss my thought process after. Thank the Lord I won the die roll because even though I sat next to this guy earlier I got tunnel vision during my match and didnt know he was on Hexproof. Very tight g1, after dropping to 4 he drops to 4 to bluff Fog but I see his bluff and kill him. g2 I made 1 obvious mistake but I dont think it would have mattered because I never drew Mortars to kill stalkers. g3 I curve out Pilgrim Boar Resto but his Simic Charm to protect his Flight from my Ray is a big play. After that I didn't draw anything besides a Tmaw a turn too late and not mortars or a ray. I was on a 5 outer and didnt get there.  

7-2

At the end of the day I got 10th, Bryan who got 8th in the WMCQ got 26th. Jack got 27th, and John ended up some where just outside of prize support in the 30s. I am very proud of how I did in my 2nd ever large Constructed Competitive event considering I had not tested with this deck one bit, threw it together the morning of, and was missing 2 Voices + 2 Acts SB. 

Now about the play/draw issue in the last round. I chose to play because I knew there were at least 2 Junk Reanimator and 1 Bant Hexproof in the top 8, being on the draw is not a good place to be for my deck against them. If I had won I would have been 1st seed and first place in standings giving me a good chance against the 3 people mentioned and a huge advantage over the Jund deck in the top8 and whatever else I would have faced. We have discussed this several times and I still stand by my decision, I felt I made the greatest risk/reward option to win the whole event rather than being able to say I top8ed my first Constructed PTQ ever with a deck I hadnt tested and be listed on Wizards website and win a box just to lose to Hexproof or Reanimator. There is only 1 person the group I went down with who would have drawn but everybody respects what I chose.

I got 12 Packs and opened some good stuff including a Stomping Ground, Ral Zarek, and an Aetherling. Its just too bad I didn't get 9th, then I would have loved to make jokes about being top 9 king.

Thanks to the SGW crew who came down and lent my poor ass cards so I could compete in these events and for supporting my decision to play. I had a great time and can't wait to go to States or more PTQs in the fall after making some $$$ from my summer camp job.

**Card discussion:**

DRS: This guy is good against so many decks. Only problem is I wish he could reliably ramp (I tried out using forbidden alchemy to get lands in the GY but this is janky). Could see dropping him to 2 MB in my heavy agro meta. 

Vampire Nighthawk: Good all around 3 drop, could be a 4 of. Good synergy with simic charm (kills a thrag without dying, nets 5 life). Great buffer against agro

Thragtusk: Best 5 drop creature in standard

Evil Twin: Awesome with Thrag or Aetherling, killer vs. midrange.

Aetherling: This guy is a HOUSE. Could see running 3, he is so good at killing planeswalkers, thragtusks, planeswalkers and finishing the game. Awesome with Garruk's -3.

Gaze of Granite: Awesome boardwipe, works well vs. agro. Kill all their 1-2 cmc and keep your nighthawk up. Late game it deals with just about any threat besides drownyard. 

Plasm Capture: This thing is awesome, such a tempo swing if you farseek and then 3rd turn leave open 4 mana. Counter a spell on their turn and then you can 4th turn Aetherling. Works well against sphynx/rakdos return/X cards in general. 

Far // Away: Utility. I'm liking this card a lot so far. Bant aura is going to see more play since armadillo cloak is back, edict effects are always useful, with 2-for-1 potential. 

Putrefy: Great all around removal.

**Cards considered/tested:**

Garruk Relentless: He is pretty good against a lot of decks, but he doesn't end games like big garruk can. Being able to search for an Aetherling is really clutch though.

Dimir Charm: This card has so much utility, but at the end of the day I feel like the other cards are more important

Griselbrand: Really good with plasm capture, but often just sits in your hand or gets discarded to lily. 

Think Twice: If this deck needs one thing it's a draw outlet. This card does help smooth certain draws out, but this deck was starting to feel clogged with 2 cmc spells so I opted for more spot removal.

Forbidden Alchemy: Decent synergy with DRS. I often found myself using the mana from plasm capture to flash it back, but then you have to use it

Progenitor Mimic: This card wrecks certain decks, but is a dead draw against others. I was thinking of trying running these, upping the aetherling and evil twin count and then running Cavern of Souls (shapeshifter). Not sure how it'd play out.

**Cards I'd like to try:**

Increasing ambition: I think this would be really good with plasm capture, would give the deck a little more ummph. 

Deadbridge chant: Probably needs a deck built around it, but could be powerful. Could also just end up giving you a bunch of land every turn. 

Snapcaster Mage: I don't think I run enough instant/sorcery, but these could allow this deck to pull off some really clutch plays. 

Overall I wish I could squeeze in some think twices, and maybe one more bomb threat. Anybody see any glaring weaknesses that I'm overlooking? Thanks for any input.

When i saw it i immediately started making a list i thought it'd do well in. my first instinct was grixis but i couldnt really make it work. i've played the rug flash list a lot and thought i'd see how he'd fit with the yeva/wolfir approach. notion thief was perfoming pretty badly main so that got pitched to the board pretty quickly. as i kept playing the list i started to realize i was winning an awful lot (on cockatrice so take that for what it's worth). here is the list i've been playing: http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/bug-flash-1/

I'm assuming at this point you guys are all familiar with why i've got yeva, wolfir avenger, and snapcaster so i'll skip right to the other cards

4x Skylasher: i think i'm in love with this card. a lot of times he'll just end up trading with a little dude so he ends up just being another removal spell, and that's fine. almost as often as that he'll take down a mana dork that had nothing better to do on their turn and that feels great. he really shines when youre staring down an augur or two and just chipping away for 2 each turn. feels great that he can't be azo charmed.

3x Varolz, the Scar Striped: this guy is a HOUSE. i've been so impressed with the results of this card. having another creature that regenerates is huge. yes, ""scavenge only as a sorcery"" feels bad. but typically by the time you want to start scavenging onto him or an avenger you'll have plenty of lands and you can use your best judgement as to how much mana should be left open when you pass the turn. once you do start piling the counters on that often means it's game. (unless youre playing an azorius charm deck. feels bad.) maybe you have to play it to understand, but this guy is awesome.

2x Putrefy, 2x Abrupt Decay, 2x Ultimate Price: Yes there are other options in these colors but these have been working very well. abrupt decay and putrefy are just insane. i would love to try far//away but this removal package has been getting the job done just fine.

3x Syncopate, 3x Dissipate, 1x Essence Scatter: Quite a lot of counters but i like it. Thoughts i've been having are that the essence scatter could just as well be another removal spell. Plasm capture is an option but i dont like it in here. there's also mystic genesis but there's so many times when that's just a dead card.

3x Think Twice, 1x Forbidden Alchemy: Love the forbidden alchemy and wish i had more but i just had to cut down to 1. 

I'm digging this build because of the hard removal. the aggro matchup is very favorable post board with 4 abrupt decay although some form of life gain would be nice. i've given some thought to thragtusk but it hasnt quite made the list yet. 

anyways, this looks promising so far. obviously there's still a lot of room to improve. would love to hear what you guys think.",STANDARD,False,,t5_2utkz,1366999728.0,,,True,t3_1d58z8,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/1d58z8/well_since_weve_been_talking_about_rug_flash_and/,

**Extra Discussion**

Whew there are a lot of things in standard right now! Now, obviously I have tried a lot of different cards in my testing to arrive at my current board. Things I have tried in the past that don't seem awful include:

* Garruk, Primal Hunter
* Rapid Hybridization
* Magma Quake
* Wolfir Silverheart
* Rolling Temblor

Have any questions feel free to ask. Also remember that the above should *not* be taken as ""hard and fast"" rules for side boarding. Almost every deck you play against could include slight variations from a ""stock"" list that could require slightly different boarding for optimal play. This is the reason why I *never* write out advanced side boarding guides and always ""fly by the seat of my pants"" when playing an event. The more you play test boarded games, the easier boarding should become.

1360010670.0,23,self.spikes,17vxoq,[Limited] Gatecrash Draft 5-color archetype Primer,30,7,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/17vxoq/limited_gatecrash_draft_5color_archetype_primer/,"So i've been working on perfecting drafting 5-color in Gatecrash.  It seems to be one of the better archetypes, so i'd like to give it some discussion and get some feedback on pick order.

So far I have drafted this archetype 3 times - and each time I easily 3-0'd the draft.  One of these drafts was FNM, the other two against very skilled players, so I would argue that the sample size is small but still large enough to make some conclusions.

***The advantages of this archetype***

* Will always be the best deck at the table if you get your mana working

* Always have answers to bombs

* Get to play any sweet rares opened in packs 2 and 3

* Significantly less reliant on signals, meaning it will be more consistent at a weaker draft table, and stronger if you don't know much about the format.

* Extremely high win % against drafters with weaker decks (due to being cut, misreading signals, just being bad, etc.)

* This *is* /r/spikes, but this deck is REALLY fun to play :)


***Disadvantages***

* Easy to lose to your manabase if you draft poorly

* Very weak to Naturalize in games 2 and 3

* Can fold to extremely aggressive Boros draws


Pick Order:

**1. Bombs**

Having a card that steals games from being way behind is really nice.  You don't really need any absolute bombs in your deck, because you should be able to grind out most games, but I would never pass most good rares.

**2. Top-tier removal**

My pick order for removal goes something like this:

* [Merciless Eviction](http://magiccards.info/gtc/en/177.html)
* [Grisly Spectacle](http://magiccards.info/gtc/en/66.html)
* [One Thousand Lashes](http://magiccards.info/gtc/en/183.html)
* [Orzhov Charm](http://magiccards.info/gtc/en/185.html)
* [Killing Glare](http://magiccards.info/gtc/en/70.html)
* [Arrows of Justice](http://magiccards.info/gtc/en/211.html)
* [Homing Lightning](http://magiccards.info/gtc/en/96.html)
* [Mugging](http://magiccards.info/gtc/en/102.html)
* [Ground Assault](http://magiccards.info/gtc/en/168.html)
* [Executioner's Swing](http://magiccards.info/gtc/en/161.html)

I expect to get at least 5-6 top-tier removal spells.  This is the most important part of the deck, and I will always take these spells over fixing.  We want to use removal early to help stabilize the board against Aggro and Mid-Range decks.  Against Orzhov I tend to hold removal for Extort creatures, which doesn't seem to be common knowledge yet :)

A few notes on the order:

* Merciless Eviction isn't a bomb in this deck always, but when it is good it is REALLY good.  I'm never worried about passing it though, 

* Executioner's Swing is much better in this deck than others, since it is in the best colors, kills an early Boros creature on turn 2 or 3 very easily, and can kill evasive creatures.

* Ground Assault doesn't really kill anything before turn 3, so it is a little worse than normal.

**3. [Prophetic Prism](http://magiccards.info/gtc/en/234.html) and [Urban Evolution](http://magiccards.info/gtc/en/204.html)**

**4. [Verdant Haven](http://magiccards.info/gtc/en/138.html)**

**5. All of the Guildgates and Keyrunes**

I think Urban Evolution should be self-explanatory - the card is insane.

I like taking both Verdant Haven and Prophetic Prism over Guildgates.  These cards are the engine in this deck, and I try to get at least 2 Prisms and at least 1 Haven.  I wouldn't take more than 2 Havens generally, but I will take any amount of Prisms.  I always take Prism over Haven.

I also like taking Guildgates over Keyrunes.  Keyrunes tend to be a bit slow in this format, but the fixing is invaluable.  In particular, the Orzhov keyrune does a lot for this deck: provides the two most important colors, blocks well, and gains life.  I don't really like playing more than 4 keyrunes in any deck, so I wouldn't pick too many.

**5. Lower tier removal and top-tier creatures**

Basically, the really good cards I still want in my deck, but are not essential to it working.  I will almost always pick a Guildgate or Keyrune over these cards.

Some examples of cards that fall into this category: (in no particular order, since each cards value depends on what else is in your deck)

* [Smite](http://magiccards.info/gtc/en/25.html)
* [Cinder Elemental](http://magiccards.info/gtc/en/87.html)
* [Debtor's Pulpit](http://magiccards.info/gtc/en/10.html)
* [Angelic Edict](http://magiccards.info/gtc/en/2.html)
* [Death's Approach](http://magiccards.info/gtc/en/62.html)

* [Bane Alley Broker](http://magiccards.info/gtc/en/145.html)
* [Guardian of the Gateless](http://magiccards.info/gtc/en/14.html)
* [Ghor-Clan Rampager](http://magiccards.info/gtc/en/167.html)
* [Nimbus Swimmer](http://magiccards.info/gtc/en/181.html)
* [Dinrova Horror](http://magiccards.info/gtc/en/155.html)

**6. Defensive creatures and big stuff to end the game**

Four toughness is the number we look for here.  This is when I start taking cards like [Elusive Krassis](http://magiccards.info/gtc/en/160.html), [Knight of Obligation](http://magiccards.info/gtc/en/18.html), [Basilica Guards](http://magiccards.info/gtc/en/5.html), and [Corpse Blockade](http://magiccards.info/gtc/en/60.html).

I also really like picking up one or two copies of [Zhur-Taa Swine](http://magiccards.info/gtc/en/210.html) and [Ruination Wurm](http://magiccards.info/gtc/en/192.html) to make sure we have a way of closing out games.


**Notable cards that we value much lower than normal**

* Pit Fight

This is a great card, but it will not help the games we aren't already winning, since if we have the largest creature in play, we have usually already won.

* Smite

We often don't have a creature in play until turn 4, so while this card is very slow, it is extremely efficient.  It also almost never kills fliers or evasive creatures, which are the top priority.  I will usually take this card pretty early, but it is definitely not a first pickable card in this archetype.

* Guildmages

It is really hard to get these going, since we have few creatures and use lots of mana every turn.  That said, the [Skarrg Guildmage](http://magiccards.info/gtc/en/196.html) is quite a good finisher.

**Open Questions**

* I really don't know how to value the worse removal spells against the really good defensive creatures.  For example, [Mindeye Drake](http://magiccards.info/gtc/en/43.html) vs. [Angelic Edict](http://magiccards.info/gtc/en/2.html)?

* Which color guildgates and keyrunes to pick up first.  Orzhov tends to always be the best, but if I have no Guildgates yet, do I take the Gruul or Simic one?

Round 1:G/B Zombies - This was a deck I haven't played against before. He ran Gravecrawler , Bloodghast , Geralf's Messenger , and Lotleth Troll . Very fast but Wurmcoil Engine let me stabilize in game 1. (SB in Oblivion Stone ) Game 2 I had a lot harder of a time with all he hand disruption that got sided in. Game 3 I mull'ed to 5 and it was not meant to be. This deck mulligans horribly. (1-2) (0-1)

Round 2: B/W Tokens - One of the best possible match ups. I got Sundering Titan out turn 4 after an early Pyroclasm to blow up his lands, followed by Karn.(SB in Oblivion Stone ) Game 2 he pile shuffled because he acted as though I stacked my deck. It didn't make him happy when I landed Karn turn 3 and another turn 4. My early Maps and ramp are just amazing. (2-0) (1-1)

Round 3: Storm - Terrible match, but at least I knew what he was running from watching a fellow Tron player play him. When I saw I had 2 relic-of-progentus in my opening hand I snap-kept. I got a Karn turn 3 to hit a land. He had to waste a Grape Shot on Karn and I won with Wurmcoil Engine . (SB in 2 Faith's Shield , 3 Slaughter Games ) I resolved turn 4 Slaughter on Empty the Warrens and he scooped, since he took out Grape Shot. (2-0) (2-1)

Round 4: Storm - An even worse match than before because he ran Pyromancer's Ascension. He detroyed me by turn 4. (SB in 4 Nature's Claim , 2 Faith's Shield , 3 Slaughter Games ) Game 2 my Nature's Claim s destoyed his Ascension and Blood Moon . I came over the top with multiple Coils so on to game 3. One of the most epic games I've had. He used Empty the Warrens for about to after I had a Coil out. We ended up on turns, an I was turn 0. I played a 2nd Coil on 0. He passed his turn 1. I swung with both Coils and put him down to 8 goblins. I Eye of Ugin 'ed Emrakul on his turn 3. Turn 4 I swung with the Coils to put him down to 6 goblins, 4 lands, and 16 life. I cast Emrakul and stole his turn 5. I began combat and he sac'ed all but 2 goblins. after Annihilator resolved before blockers I Faith's Shield 'ed a Coil to get lethal in. (2-1) (3-1)

Round 5: 4c Pod - So many people were playing this so I was due to hit it and I was not excited. I got combo'ed out game 1. (SB in 2 Combust , 2 Faith's Shield , 1 Oblivion Stone , 2 Torpor Orb ) Turn 3 Karn after some ramp and won it handily. Game 3 He was able to Sowing Salt my Mine and I didn't have my Faith's Shield to protect it. I luckily drew into all my Coils and a Stone. He admittedly got mana screwed and I was able to eek it out. (2-1) (4-1)

Round 6: Jund - I love this match up. I absolutely crushed him after I Pyroclasm 'ed and landed Coils. (SB in 2 Faith's Shield , Wurmcoil Engine ) He SB in more hand disruption. I got extremely lucky and landed a turn 3 Karn to exile lilliana-of-the-veil. He had a Dark Confidant doing crazy damage to himself, hitting himself with his 4 drops. He put himself down to 1 life, and I resolved a Sundering Titan which I loved as a last minute addition, blowing up 4 lands. I resolved an Emrakul and it was GG. (2-0) (5-1)

Round 7: Splinter Twin - Another terrible match. He kept a one land hand with some dig and didn't find any, so his chance at the quick win was over. I resolved turn 4 karn and ate his lands. ((SB in 2 Combust , 2 Torpor Orb , 2 Slaughter Games , 4 Nature's Claim ) Game 2 I restarted the game late with Karn because he had 10 mana available and could win at any time. I ended up losing as he top-decked Twin and slammed it. Game 3 I got turn 3 Karn again (been happening like crazy). I controlled board state with Torpor Orb and Emrakul took me to the Top 8. (2-1) (6-1)

Top8: RG Tron, 2x Jund, 3x Pod, Reanimate, Slippery BogleTop 8:3rd(me) vs 6th: 4c Pod - I wish there was something I could say aside from Harmonic Sliver . He resolved turn 2 on a map, then Phantasmal Image 'ed it to blow up a Star and Sphere. (SB in 2 Combust , 2 Torpor Orb , Oblivion Stone ) Game 2 Deceiver Exarch on my Upkeep to slow me down followed by Thalia. I hit no Torpor Orb's or Pyroclasm and got my face smashed. (0-2)

6-1 (3rd/118): Deck drew extremely well aside from 2 games. I think I need more Torpor Orb s since it loses so hard to Pod.

You have a general understanding of the rules, and you can make a fairly competitive deck to take to FNM, or at least pilot one you may have built based on another list. All of this leads to you wanting to get better and better, and to eventually win that FNM! 

That, or something close to it, should be your mindset. You should have a desire to learn everything you can about the game; improvement starts here. Accepting that you can always be a better player and trying to accurately determine what the causes were in every win and loss are the strongest tools an improving player can wield.

So we start with a blank slate: where do I start?

Well, the first question is whether or not you even want to play paper.

- Paper or Digital

Becoming a better tournament player means you're required to have access to a large card pool (or at least enough money/value to obtain the things you need). As you network and make connections with people, you can grow your card pool by making friends that will trust you with their cards and sometimes even let you borrow entire decks. Now, this is always a monetary investment. **THERE ARE NO FREE RIDES.** This is the largest hurdle prospective tournament players come across, and also the most important; it doesn't matter how good a player you are if your decks are just that much worse.

Now, how your schedule matches up with your local shops' schedules should determine which road you take. If you don't have a way to take Friday nights off, or if you work full time and can't really get out to a tournament, then Magic Online is almost always going to be the best bet. You won't have to spend tons of time trying to track down cards; they're all located in the Classifieds. Lots of cards are much cheaper on MTGO; Mythics are about the only exception. Sometimes something like Blade Splicer, which became popular in multiple decks simultaneously almost overnight, will rise in price dramatically. Overall, though, MTGO is fairly cost-efficient, especially with Daily Events (but we'll discuss that later).

If you have lots of free time and your local shop offers decent prize support, it would be a good idea to go and make some connections down there while you play. You'll get to know a lot of good players in places where the prize support is respectable. As long as you're not a total dick, you should be able to get in some social circles and get people to trust you enough with their cards that they will let you borrow them. Making friends and playing Magic should go hand in hand, in an ideal world! Strive for it.

- Learn the Rules

This game has lots of complicated interactions, and the more knowledge of the rules you have, the better your chances of finding the best plays. Not being able to make the best play because you can't see it is a serious hindrance to improvement!

The [comprehensive rules](http://www.wizards.com/magic/comprules/MagicCompRules_20120201.pdf) are a great resource to have. If you ever have a question about a specific interaction, find an example in the rules to determine the proper course of action. Never be afraid to call the judge, either! It's his job, that's what he's there for.

The best thing to do, though, is to learn from playing a lot; practice makes perfect, and finding out about an obscure interaction in a playtest session is far preferred to discovering it in the middle of a tournament, where it really counts.

- Practice

There's no substitute for practice. Studying is important, but applying what you learn is crucial. Most of being a winning tournament Magic player is analyzing lines of play and determining which one will get the most value out of all of your cards while providing the least value to your opponent. Knowing that certain cards have synergy with each other is not the same as experiencing how they interact in the context of a match.

Seriously, play more.

Every time you play, analyze what you could have done better. There's almost never a game where you play perfectly; find your mistakes and figure out how not to make them again. Writing down your life totals on paper and making note of what caused the changes will allow you to better reconstruct the match in your head.

- Know your Format

The smaller the format, the easier it is to know every card you might have to play against. This means that Limited formats (Draft and Sealed) are going to be the easiest to learn, since you're only dealing with sets from one block. As you move to constructed formats, they steadily get bigger. Block Constructed deals with the sets in the most recent Expert expansion; Standard uses cards from the two most recent Expert expansions and the most recent Core set. That means that Limited, Block, and Standard are all formats that constantly rotate. Because of this, prices can fluctuate rapidly due to changes in demand more often than the eternal formats. In paper Magic, Standard and Draft are the most popular, while Sealed is slightly less so and Block Constructed hardly sees play at all. On MTGO, all of these formats are very popular.  There's also Extended, but not even Wizards likes Extended.

Vintage, Pauper, Legacy, and Modern are eternal formats. They differ from the other formats in that they have established ban lists, but no cards rotate out. So as every new set is printed, those cards become available to play with. In paper Magic, Legacy and Modern are the most popular, with Pauper rarely seen and and sanctioned Vintage events being some kind of strange ghost that you only hear about in stories. On MTGO, Pauper is the most popular, followed by Modern, with Legacy events firing irregularly and Vintage not even existing due to the lack of Power 9 cards.

The most important part of this point, though, is that you need to know as many of the cards in the format you're playing as possible. You want to be able to calculate how many cards in your opponent's deck might actually win him the game, or get him out of a specific situation, or put you in a bad spot if you play one way and not another. Now, this doesn't require that you learn EVERY card in a format; for Legacy, this would be almost impossible. However, you should keep your eyes out for commonly played cards and which decks they appear in. 

You should know, for example, that if your opponent plays a Volcanic Island on their first turn, there's a possibility they could have Daze or Force of Will in their hand to counter your first spell, even if they don't have any mana available. You should know that if your opponent played a Blade Splicer on turn 3 and passed the turn without doing anything on turn 4, it's likely they have a Restoration Angel in their hand.

- Wrap-up

This is a basic, cursory guideline to help you choose the right path in your tournament Magic career. Choosing to go down one path and changing midway can be a real difficult task, and getting value on your investments may prove a substantial hurdle. Hopefully, you can use this simple information to better form your own opinions and craft the line of play that will lead you to many Top 8s.",,False,,t5_2utkz,1346040071.0,,,True,t3_yueso,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/yueso/from_the_onset_to_the_end_a_new_players_guide_to/,

Tournament Report:
 
 
Round 1: Mono Green Aggro

After winning the dice roll I kept a hand with LBZ, doom blade, an ultimate price, and good land.  His elf eats a doom blade and he follows up with stangleroot geist. He eventually suits up a predator ooze  becuase I spent too much time worrying about the strangleroot geist and even 2 thragtusks can't save me. I even LBZ'd away a kalonian hydra at one point, I just don't have access to exile effects so my outs were limited.  Game 2 I sideboard in edicts, appetite for brains  (my Lifebane Zombie revelaed a Garruk caller of beasts game one), and removal. I sideboarded out the sin collectors, desecration demon, and disciple of bolas.  I keep a hand full of answers and spend the first 6 turns either killing or making him sacrifice his board.  Eventually he plays Big Garruk and I answer with an Oblivion Ring.  At this point I still hadn't seen a creature but the next turn I lay down a thragtusk. He was out of steam and eventually died to the lone tusk I played.  Unfortunately this game took us to 8 minutes left in the round and we agree to speed this game up.  I kept a hand with Ooze, LBZ, Abrupt Decay and no white land.  He kept a 2 land on the play but still curved out to play a ton of elves.  I zap away a craterhoof the turn before he plays it with LBZ.  At some point I drew a mutilate and killed his 5 or 6 elves and my LBZ after it had gotten in for 3 damage.  I had 3 green sources at this point and played my ooze.  I got in for 5 and passed the turn right as time expired.  he didn't have a follow up but the graveyard didn't have the fuel for my ooze to get there.  At this point I asked my opponent to concede because the board state was vastly in my favor.  He agreed and it pretty much made my day.
 
 

1-0
 
 

Round 2: GB Rock

This was her 2nd time playing the deck and she played very tight magic considering that.  Game 1 was a grind fest and involved my LBZing away a tusk and her making me sac the zombie with Liliana.  I abupt decay the Lili and we don't do much else for a while.  Eventually we start trading tusks and I topdeck 2 in a row with a resto angel and grind out the win.  We brought in all out hand disruption and the match was decided by who saw the right disruption first.  I kept a hand with duress and appetite.  She leads with an appetite for brains but I only have the disruption and lifebane zombie.  I played a duress and she revealed another appetite for brains and a Liliana, I make her discard lili.  The game came down to me eating her hand with discard effects and blinking LBZ and tusk for the win.  

2-0

 
 
Round 3: Big Red

I've never actually played against this deck and underestimated how resilient chandras phoenix can be.  I'm on the play and LBZ away a boros reckoner, but he had 2 in hand so I dealt with that one via doom blade.  Eventually I tusk and resto the win and race a thundermaw hellkite.  The game actually took alot longer than you would think as I took a long time making some of my decisions.  I brought in spot removal and oblivion ring for burning earth and got rid of the mass removal and sin collectors.  Game 2 he plays a turn 3 chandras phoenix and uses, shock, searing spear and bonfire to buyback the phoenix stall the game out until he played a burning earth.  I play a thragtusk and gain 1, but it wasn't enough to stop the hellrider and thundermaw barrage that ensued.  Game 3 was the best game of magic I have played to date.  I kept a hand with sign in blood, 2 basic swamps, doom blades,  ultimate price, and LBZ.  I draw the much needed lands with sign in blood and traded his early reckoner and phoenix with removal, but he had a mutavault pinging me.  He gets a burning earth into play and I had the oblivion ring for it, but he had a second one to follow up with.  I play Obzedat to gain life and he crashes in with a hellrider and mutavault.  Decide to take it as I have restoration angel in hand and I can't lose the obzedat to shock or it's game over.  After combat my life total is at 4 and he was still at 20.  I hit him for 5 with obzedat and blink the ghost with my opponent tapped out. The board state stalls for him and I get in with resto and the obzedat triggers taking him to 3.  The way the game ended with me removing the hellrider and the mutavault creature with one card left in his hand. Because of the burning earth the removal took me down to 2 life, leaving me dead to either shock or spear.  I asked if he had it and he revealed a mountain.  I breathed a giant sigh of relief as that combat step took a good 4 or 5 minutes to resolve with a huge crowd around our game.  You would have had to be watching to see how great of a game it was.

3-0

Round 4: UWr Flash

Game 1 I kept a great hand against creature decks.  2 removal spells. LBZ, Desecration Demon, and 3 land.  he proceeded to counter every single creature spell I played that game except one.  Eventually I stick and obzedat but it wasn't enough to save me from double resto beats.  Game 2 was much better with duress and all 3 of the 4 sin collectors hitting the battlefield. One thing I do in the matchup is take think twice if I see that thye're land isn't great.  Alot of people get rid of sphinx's rev but if you prevent them from ever getting those drops it's as good as a 3 for 1.  The sin collectors and a resto angel are enough to close this game.  Game 3 I nabbed a resto angel with LBZ and laid down the beats all the way to him at 11 while he raced with a topdecked resto angel.  he helixed the zombie before it got him too low and I just never got the pressure back up despite a thragtusk.  The game ended with with him helixing me then snap helixing me to deal 10 in 2 turns.  Oh well, you win some you lose some.  Great games too.

3-1

 
Round 5: Jund

My opponent seemed pretty tilted from what I'm assuming was a bad loss recently in the tournament and I feel like he bought himself some bad luck.  There's no way to quantify that of course,  but it seems people who have poor attitudes, or are dicouraged, seem to find ways to lose.  Game 1 I win the dice roll and take a huntmaster before he farseeks into it.  He never found the 5th land for a thragtusk and I flickered the zombie to take it anyway.  He eventually clears the board with bonfire but I won the thragtusk war with some help from scavenging ooze and won from there.  Game 2 I boarded poorly and had to discard off of a sign in blood on turn 2.  It didn't matter bacuase he farseeked into olivia and I had no answers.  game 3 he kept a hand with 2 kessig wolf runs and an overgrown Tomb with a farseek.  He never found Triple green for a garruk and I ripped his hand apart with sin collector, appetite for brains out of the board,  and LBZ. The discard in this deck is nuts.

4-1


Round 6: Act II Aristocrats

I don't remember the specifics of the match as these games involve alot of what I call ""microtransactions"".  Meaning they ping you with blood artist and and hit you with souls tokens but nothing devastating happens outside of reckoner into blasphemous acts.  I remember scavenging ooze hitting his souls every time he played them and me removing his reckoners and Oringing his blood artists to not lose to blasphemous acts.  The games were good but I just had all the right answers. 2-0

5-1

Round 7:  UWr Flash

I've played this guy before and know that he is sorest of losers.  This guy makes magic look so bad.  He's not a neckbeard a social misfit, just a giant asshole.  I have no respect for someone who won't shake your hand after a loss when you extend your hand.  It really grinds my gears even now.  Anyway I lose game 1 after getting 3 thragtusks countered and my lone LBZ pillared.  He finished me with aetherling.  Game 2 I side in all the hand disruption and the extra sin collector and side out the mutilate and every bit of removal that doesn't hit thundermaw hellkite.  I sin collector his think twice and screw him off land. I then duress his sphinx's revelation and appetite for brains his thuindermaw.  After that Thragtusk and Obzedat clean up.  Worked like a machine.  Game 3 was much of the same expect I only hit one of his sphinxs revelations and he get one off for 3.  After he verdicts an early wave of sin collector and LBZ I start chaining resto thragtusk and he floods out.  Losing to mana issues is the worst, but there was no reason to act the way he acted.

6-1


Round 8:  RWB Humancrats

The old win and in.  At this point I am in fifth and could tie in, but it would leave my 6th seeded opponent at 9th place.  So we play and I lose the dice roll 9 to 10. bleh. I keep a hand with 4 land, LBZ, Thragtusk, and Resto Angel.  In hindsight this is a good hand on the play, but one of the worst on the draw.  I see him pay 2 for a sacred foundry and shit myself as he plays a turn one Champion of the Parish.  I play a tapped overgrown tomb and I see him smile.  We both know I'm fucked.  His turn 2 play is gather the townsfolk and he starts the beats. 17-20.   play a tapped Godless Shrine and cry a little.  His turn 3 play was a doomed traveler and a blood artist.  Dat curve 11-20.  After my LBZ revealing a falkenrath aristcrat I see my PTQ flash before my eyes.  He finishes me with sorin emblems and aristocrat.  Thragtusk Resto be damned.  At least my sideboard was somewhat relevant with the sac effects and mutilate.  I really with I had curse of deaths hold in the board and but for whatever reason I though aristocrats was dead.  Game 2 I keep Doom Blade, devour flesh, desecration demon, mutilate, and land. I devour flesh is turn 2 cartel aristocrat and let hime fill the board with lingering souls and another cartel aristocrat.  I mutilate and get in with desecration demon and a topdecked Lifebane zombie.  He floods out and I get game 2.  Game 3 was the devastating for me.  I mulligan the exact hand I got game 1 and get a hand with 3 land, LBZ, Thragtusk, and Obzedat.  I never saw the 4th land and watched him kill me with an equally slow starting hand.  I'm not gonna lie, it hurt to get that close to the top 8 and not make it, but at the same time I'm super stoked at 10th place.

6-2, 10th Place
 
 
Overall it was huge success and after I got over my loss and collected my prize I was very satisfied with the whole thing.  I brought a rogue deck and performed well with it. Can't ask for much more.  I don't plan on continuing this archetype as I don't think it will be as good in a meta full of G/R aggro, but if I did I would cut desecration demon and disciple of Bolas for something, probably another scavenging ooze and maybe more removal.  Thanks for reading guys!

I can see why it's good against control, but people have forgotten that control decks aren't at the top. I haven't seen a control list win a big tournament in a long time. It's always some aggro variant or jund. Maybe I just don't pay attention enough, but control definitely seems like it's not the strongest archetype in the format. 

Let's talk about the aggro decks. Naya decks don't really care about burning earth because they're casting t2 smiter/reckoner, t3 huntmaster, t4 thrag/thundermaw and beating your face in. Jund decks play Thragtusk and bonfire to deal with aggro's actual threats. Sphinx's rev basically just becomes ""draw x cards"", and wear//tear comes out of the board (if it's even there, I don't play UWR). Hexproof kills you the turn after you cast burning earth, and it does nothing for you. 

I'm just not seeing why people have hyped it up so much. Did I miss something?",,False,,t5_2utkz,False,,,True,t3_1jeqqc,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/1jeqqc/standard_card_discussion_burning_earth/,
1374811121.0,24,self.spikes,1j2rm6,[STANDARD] Why UWR flash is the only blue deck you should be playing,34,10,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/1j2rm6/standard_why_uwr_flash_is_the_only_blue_deck_you/,"So I’ve been playing a version of UWR very close to Matt Costa’s that he piloted to a GP top 8 at GP Miami.  You can view the list here: http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/uwr-flash-21-07-13-1/
Why should you play UWR flash over other UW control variants?  There are a lot of reasons:

1)	Supreme Verdict sucks.  A lot of decks get BETTER board positions after you cast it.  It’s pretty abysmal.

2)	Terminus can be great when you miracle it and pretty awful when you don’t.

3)	Planeswalkers (which are usually very strong versus dedicated UW control variants) are very easy to deal with and you don’t have to play temporary solutions (oblivion ring, detention sphere)

4)	You can close out a game much quicker than aetherling or drownyard decks.

One of the biggest reasons I have trouble picking up blue decks is because you can frequently have trouble closing out games that stretch on for seemingly days.  I never want to go to time in a round and have my match decided by 5 extra turns if I can help it.  U/W/R has the ability to quickly switch gears from survival control mode to beat down.  With the addition of Mutavault, you can quickly number the amount of draw steps your opponent can have before conceding.  Also, all of the win conditions that this deck uses also get value and are able to help you survive.

Card choices:

Mutavault : I like these a lot.  They do everything that you want to be doing, make sphinx’s revelations larger and make closing out a game faster.  They generally won’t jump in front of a turn 2 Burning-Tree Emissary but will join Restoration Angel in doing their best lava axe impression.  Encroaching wastes might help you in some situations but generally I aim to nullify any threats from spell lands by killing all of my opponent’s creatures.

Thundermaw Hellkite: I don’t play Aetherling, I don’t think he’s good in this deck or does what this deck wants to do.  Thundermaw hits hard, fast, and for less mana.  Thundermaw is also a lot better at closing out games if you draw multiple (there are several games I’ve played that ended with turn 5 thundermaw, turn 6 thundermaw).  Aetherling is very hard to kill but is also VERY slow.  Ideally you should be able to protect your threats with counter spells and the durability factor of aetherling should not matter.  The mana/damage ration of thundermaw is also much higher as this deck wants to play a win condition and then protect it until it wins.

Counterflux:  With the waning popularity of Junk Reanimator, I think counterflux is better than it’s ever been.  That being said, this slot is a flex slot and if you see a lot of lingering souls you may want to run Dissipate but Counterflux is the clear winner in blue mirrors.

61st card: There is a flex slot here too, I trim 1 pillar if I’m expecting more Midrange and control decks and trim 1 warleader’s helix if I’m expecting more naya or aristocrat decks.


Sideboard:

I’ve made a few changes post-m14.  I am playing 2 wear//tear to respect burning earth.  They were keening apparitions but I found that frequently playing the 2/2 just wasn’t ever as good as flashback on wear//tear.  These also come in against bant hexproof and can sometimes give us just enough of a chance to race.
Supreme Verdict: Yeah I said it sucks but it’s really good at stabilizing against 2 matchups.  Bant hexproof and any kind of naya or mono-red esque deck.  Basically any deck that isn’t full of undying creatures, blood artists, and Xathrid Necromancers.


Ratchet Bomb: I bring this in against bant hexproof once again to hope to get their similarly costed permanents.  This matchup is usually a crap shoot so I don’t devote too many sideboard slots to a deck that you beat more often than not when it beats itself.


Thundermaw:  He comes in against every non-aggressive matchup but he stays in the board because of how bad Thundermaw is in matchups where it’s bad.  If you ever look at your opening hand against monored with a thundermaw in it, feel bad about your pseudo mulligan.  Winning the first game against aggressive decks is very important because you can’t be how sure they are prepared to side against you.  I’ve had the most experience with surprisingly sideboard cards from beatdown players.  


Izzet Staticaster // Renounce the Guilds:  Unfortunately both of these come in together against a lot of the same decks even though it’s a non-bo.  The staticaster shores up UWR’s general softness to token and Falkenrath Aristocrat.


Matchups:


UWX control: 

After board I feel favored in everything but the mirror match (because that should theoretically be 50/50 on paper) due to increased threat density and favoring cheaper dispels over negates to protect my threats.  Esper control decks with lots of spot removal can be a pain but if they’re relying on sweepers it’s very easy to sneak in enough damage with mutavault, snapcaster mage, and augur of bolas to finish your opponent with burn.


Jund Midrange:

Pre-board it’s usually a cake walk.  If you are able to counter the rakdos return and keep olivia and garruk off the table, most of the rest of their cards are not good.  Post board a well timed duress is all it takes to swing the matchup.  Tread carefully, the matchup is about 50/50 and comes down to how long they can keep momentum.


Bant Hexproof:

This is pretty much the matchup you want to dodge on any given day.  The first game is pretty bad and it doesn’t really get that much better after sideboard.  My suggestion is try to race as much as possible with Azorius Charm’s lifelink mode.  I have tried devoting many sideboard slots to this matchup but it rarely gets very much better without drastically affecting other matchups.  I would chalk this up as a tough loss you will likely swallow.


Naya decks:

If they go up to Thundermaw and beyond, it can play out a lot like jund without Rakdos Return, which is nice.  Make sure to use your most narrow pieces of removal first as it’s hard to kill a loxodon smiter outside of using warleader’s helix.  This matchup is generally very favorable if you’re not dead on turn 5.


Junk Aristocrats:

There are not a lot of important cards in this matchup so it is important to know which ones to counter.  The most important targets are Cartel Aristocrat and Varloz, followed in distant third by Lingering Souls.  A decent hand game 1 can stop most non-champion of the parish shenanigans.  After board, you get staticasters, thundermaws ,and renounce the guilds to clear out all of the problematic cards.  The matchup can become trivial with Rest in Peace but it’s more than good enough without it so I don’t recommend playing the enchantment.


Act 2 Aristocrats (or any red version):

This is a lot harder than the green decks because Falkenrath Aristocrat has no real good answers.  The clock it presents plus the ineffectiveness of Azorius Charm against it makes it a difficult deck to beat.  After board if you keep a hand with Renounce the Guilds and Snapcaster Mage, I would say this matchup heavily favors you.


W/B Humans:

I’m not convinced this deck is real or should have even won the SCG.  The Jund player against AJ Sacher kept some loose hands and paid the price.   The matchup’s win percentage jumps depending on how many pillar of flames you are able to draw.  As always, keeping Cartel Aristocrat off the table makes this deck a joke.  The lack of value the deck can get from sacrificing creatures also makes this matchup a lot easier than Aristocrat decks.


Mono-Red (and mono-red splash g version)

This is a matchup that comes down a lot to the die roll and how many augur of bolas and pillar of flames you can assemble on turns 1-3.  An on curve hellrider can leave you reeling but warleader’s helix and turn//burn can take him out before he does too much damage.  After sideboard, your chances of winning after turn 4 increase even more.  Volcanic Strength is likely to come in so don’t board out your Azorius Charms.  Also, playing in a way that always tests your opponent for a Ghor-Clan Ramapager is important.  That card always has a much greater impact the later the game goes and you’d almost certainly rather trade your augur of bolas for it than Restoration Angel.

1372562998.0,23,self.spikes,1hchxk,GP Miami Day 1 report with Act 2,26,3,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/1hchxk/gp_miami_day_1_report_with_act_2/,"I went 6-3, missed day 2 by a round. I admit I was disappointed, but it was my best performance at a GP yet (I went 2-x at my first GP in Atlantic City, don't even remember how many losses I incurred, I dropped; and 5-4 at GP Quebec).

I don't know if anyone is interested in a report from someone who ultimately missed day 2, but what the hell:

My deck: Aristocrats Act 2 (http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/act-2-29-04-13-2/)

I threw in Witchbane Orb into the sideboard as a last minute decision late last night. I was trying to figure out some tech against Curse of Death's Hold and other enchantments, so I was going to bring in War Priest of Thune. But I ultimately settled on WItchbane because I felt Jund was going to be more prevalent during the day, and it would stop Bonfire/Curse/Rakdos's Return from their deck. I ended up being right, as I faced four Jund decks, and Witchbane won me a round against one of them. I felt two was too much, but I never drew it against the other Jund decks. If I would go back, I'd probably take out the Intangible Virtues and Assemble, as I only faced one control deck the entire night, in my ninth round, and perhaps put in another Appetite for Brain or two.

Round 1: Bye!

Round 2: Junk Reanimator, 1-2 loss
This is normally a great match up for me. In fact, I don't think I've ever lost to a Reanimator deck with Act 2. But it was a very close match. He was on the play game 1 and just dealt the business to me with Angel of Serenity. Game 2 I marked two of his big creatures and just dominated. Game 3 was crazy close. We ended up going to time. BY that point, he had two Angel of Serenities out, where was I holding on with a Reckoner and two lingering souls tokens at 9 health. I had another Reckoner in hand, and enough mana to cast that and a Blasphemous Act in the same turn to deal 26 damage (he was at 19). Unfortunately I didn't draw any of the four acts the entire game, and eventually I ran out of chump blockers. This is a situation where the extra two Appetites might have been handy; if I could have prevented one of those Angels from entering the battlefield I would have been golden. I tend not to run gy hate, as I already have such a great match up against Reanimator.

Round 3: Jund Aggro, 0-2 loss
This was ridiculous. Game 1 he just steamrolled me and won with Falkenrath + Ghor Clan Rampager. I never had a chance to stabilize, and it was a deck I unfortunately was not too familiar with (wasn't expecting Ghor Clan onto Falkenrath). Game two I kept a bad hand, I shouldn't have - it was removal heavy but no real plays (Souls, slip, act, mark, 3 lands). I should have mulled. He just annihilated me; I was one mana/creature short from casting Act to stabilize and potentially win, and I never drew a sac outlet for my Mark. It was a terrible decision on my part.

Round 4: Jund Midrange, 2-0 win
Typical Jund midrange build with Thragtusks and Huntmasters. But she was making some mistakes, like putefying my Cartel Aristocrat instead of a 2/1 lingering soul token when I swung with both of them, when I had a vampire token to sac to that I just created with Sorin. Because Cartel didn't die, I did exact damage to win game 1. Game 2 I just sided in my Marks and stole all her threats and sacced them. I really can't overstate Mark's value in this deck, it's incredible. I probably should just freaking main board it already.

Round 5: GW Aggro, 2-0 win
This was essentially a bye. He kept a one lander game 1, and I won it on turn 4 with a Blasphemous Act + Reckoner combo with a perfect curve (my only day where I drew the ""nuts""). Game 2 I don't even recall what happened, it was over so fast.

Round 6: Jund Midrange, 2-0 win
Game 1 I won easily. I think I resolved two Falkenraths, one after the other, and he just never drew a bonfire to sweep the board. . Game 2 I sided in Witchbane Orb, played it turn 4 and shut down the Curse and Bonfire he had in his hand. He didn't have anything after that; he was actually dumbfounded when he looked at the Orb, so I was kinda happy I brought it in. Maybe it wasn't deserving of a place in the SB, as it only won me one game, but the game could have turned out very different otherwise if he had resolved that Curse. 

Round 7: Jund Midrange, 1-2 loss
Game 1 was an easy win and I was feeling very confident. Game 2 is where it got tricky, and is what ultimately cost me the entire tournament. I resolved an Obzedat on turn 5 and the game was swaying heavily in my favor. He was left with an Olivia and a 2/2 beast token left over from HUntmaster. Besides the Obzedat, I had two spirit tokens on the field and only a slip in my hand. I wanted to get rid of the Olivia, but I didn't see a good opening - I did not want to two-for-one myself by blocking the beast token he swung with, and then lose the other token to Olivia's 1 damage ability. I would have been able to slip Olivia, but I felt it was the wrong move. BUt I was terribly wrong. The tokens didn't matter shit, since he was at 6 life at that point and I only needed Obzedat to resolve three more times, not counting what else I may draw before then. Instead, I let Olivia live. On my upkeep, Obzy comes in, he shoots one of my tokens, I respond by slipping Olivia, he responds by slipping Obzedat. It was a blow out for me. I was left with just a 1/1 token and drew nothing else. He ended up resolving another Olivia and brought me down from a healthy 20 to 0. Game 3 I started off strong, but one good Golgari charm wrecked my board turn 4 (tokens + Falk) and I was done for.. my dreams crushed!

Round 8: GW Tokens, 2-1 win
This guy was a pain in the butt. A jerk, kept on saying how Act 2 required no skill etc, demeaning me. Whatever, I beat him and his tokens and walked away with a smile. Again, Mark of Mutiny was my best card. Really wish I Had an electrickery in the side, though.

Round 9: American Control, 2-1 win
My first control matchup of the night. His deck was a bit weird, his only creatures were Aetherling. Maybe not weird, but the AMerican decks I'm use to at least run Reckoner or Geist or Thundermaw. Game 1 I steamrolled him, and game 2 I sided in assemble, intangible, and sin collector. He milled me to death game 2 with Jace. I brought in Liliana and made a silly mistake - I had her at 6, facing down a Rest in Peace, Jace and nothing else but lands. I Should have just ultimated her while he was tapped out, but instead I passed turn and she ended up dying to a Warleader's HElix and some other spell. BUt game 3 I recovered and steam rolled him - he just didn't have enough answers for me, and without any threats to put pressure on me I just walked over him. Terminus slowed me down for a bit, but not enough to win.

Total: 6 wins, 3 losses. My best performance at a GP yet, but I'm still bummed that this is the last major standard event I get to play with Act 2. Really like this deck, it just steals wins like it's no one business and has no real terrible matchup, or at least as far as I could tell. I now have two byes for the next GP, so I'm happy.

I'm surprised I didn't play the mirror at all, I saw it everywhere but never got paired up. I should have made room for one Electrickery, to prepare for the inevitable mirror match (although it didn't come) and even for the two GW decks I faced. All in all, I had fun and was happy with my performance - aside from the crucial decision in round 7 against Jund with the Obzedat/Olivia interaction, I felt I played great all day. Just sad I won't be able to play Act 2 at another standard GP this year, I've had so much fun playing it.",,False,,t5_2utkz,False,,,True,t3_1hchxk,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/1hchxk/gp_miami_day_1_report_with_act_2/,

1369286068.0,22,self.spikes,1evy2f,"[Standard] Now that we've had some time with it, I hate playing Sire of Insanity. Hello Ruric Thar",32,10,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/1evy2f/standard_now_that_weve_had_some_time_with_it_i/,"I'm specifically talking about Jund Midrange. This card has just been awful for me and I'm talking well over 100 games. He was good at first, when people weren't expecting it, not knowing how to play around it optimally, etc. Now, it seems every time I lay one down I'm losing the game. Get him out early enough in the right match up, sure, but get anything out earlier enough in the right match up you're probably going to win.

I've been replacing him with 2x Ruric Thar mainboard and honestly I might even put two more in the side replacing a Vraska (I run 2 side) and Deadbridge chant, which has really only been coming in against midranged mirrors. I've found against control, the midrange mirror and most other decks where you don't have to side out your six drop, that slamming one of these down with a Cavern has been more effective than sire has ever been for me.

Granted, I don't have nearly the same play experience with Ruric Thar (20 or so games) than I have with Sire, but right away it's been the punishment that I want to be giving without hurting myself. By the time an opponent is reving for a game changing amount they typically can't afford to be taking that 6 extra damage, which is resolving before their life gain.

I'd strongly suggest those who are having issues with Sire of Insanity, I can't be the only one, to give Ruric Thar a go, he's really been the answer that I've been looking for. It's something to play around with and definitely something that I believe is going to be popping up in Jund midrange lists very soon.

1366402871.0,25,self.spikes,1cp3n8,[Modern] First ever Modern tournament with BUG Infect - Report,37,12,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/1cp3n8/modern_first_ever_modern_tournament_with_bug/,"So last night I attended my first ever Modern tournament since a guy I know hooked me up with a sweet deals on the Fetch lands I was missing for my deck. Here is the decklist for anyone that wants to check it out:

[BUG Infect] (http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/bug-infect-19-04-13-1/)

Anyways, here is a breakdown of my matchups. It's not hugely detailed because I didn't take great notes and am just going off of memory. But any tips/tricks/ideas would be greatly welcome.

**ROUND 1** UR Affinity

Game one I was on the draw, lead with a Glistern Elf into a Noble Hierarch. After that, he attempted to blow up my Elf, but a Vines of Vastwood followed up by a Groundswell ended that game.

Sideboard: -4 Rancor, +4 Nature's Might

Game two was a joke. He mulliganed to 4, had next to nothing, and I pretty much ran over him.

1-0

** Game 2** 4 color good stuff

So having tested against this player before, I knew this was going to be my worst matchup possible. But oh well. Sometimes the pairings just hate you! I lost the die roll again, and so my turn 1 Glistner Elf was met by a Lightning Bolt. After that, it was just a whole bunch of counters and bolts and Snapcasters for all my threats. He nickel and dimed me down.

Sideboard: -3 Rancor, +3 Spellskite

Game 2 I dropped a turn 1 Noble Hierarch, turn 2 Spellskite off an Inkmoth Nexus, and I took that game in pretty quick order.

Game 3 it was more of the same of Game 1, only difference is he had a turn 2 Spellskite of his own to mess up my plans. I couldn't keep any threats on board and so he managed to get me down to 3, at which point I told him I was cracking a fetch land to get an Overgrown Tomb uptapped. Lols were had. Looking at my library, my last three cards were my own Spellskites. Tables may have been flipped.

1-1

**Game 3** Mono-Black Discard Control something?

Game 1 was a little odd, he kind of durtled around, dropped a The Rack and Liliana's Caress and didn't do much else. My turn 1 Glistner Elf followed up by two Rancors and a Groundswell ended that game quickly.

Sideboard: -4 Rancor, +4 Inquisition

Game 2 I was dumb and got greedy, and despite having an Inquisition in hand, I pumped all my spells into my Inkmoth and tried to kill him. When it was a 9/9 with my Noble ready to trigger for the win, he Doom Bladed it. I played bad and I felt bad. That was followed up by 6 turned of lands, by which point he had 2 Racks out, 2 Liliana's Caress, and then forced me to dump my hand, at which point I died.

Game 3 was pretty much the highlight of my night. Turn 1 Glistener Elf followed up by Turn 2 land, Groundswell, Might main phase, Mutagenic Growth win. The dude couldn't believe it.

2-1

**Round 4** UWR Delver

Game 1 was pretty quick. Yet again, on the draw, his turn 1 Delver faced down my turn 1 Glistener Elf. My turn 2 double Rancor versus his unflipped Delver made the game in my favor. Turn 3 my Noble Hierarch proved lethal as he attempted to Bolt it, which was met by my Apostle's Blessing.

Sideboard: -3 Rancor, +3 Spellskite

Game 2 was more of the same. Glistener Elf then Blighted Agent then Plague Stinger x2 just added up the counters until I swung in for lethal. He looked like he wasn't holding much in his hand, which confused me as to why he kept it, but that's not my problem!

3-1

After the four rounds, we split to top 4. My record was good enough for 2nd with my breakers, and since it was late and I had work early, we all split. I was more than happy with it.

So the deck runs pretty quick. The biggest problem I have is people with a ton of removal/counters/Snapcasters. But other than that, I think it's a pretty solid list. I feel like I can easily steal games rather quickly, as my turn 2 kill pointed out. But if anyone has any questions/comments/suggestions, I'm all ears since I'm really new to Modern.

**Gruul** - Very fast, pretty consistent but lacking high end power(if low lands)

**Jund**  - Very fast as well, but trades some consistency for higher end power like Aristocrat.

**Naya** - Not too sure on this one.. I assume it is very fast but inconsistent but defends better than the other aggro decks with the FS'ers.

**RDW** A pinch slower than the rest possibly but still fast. Has access to high power if need be but many of the early creatures are very weak. Highly consistent though.

Background: I've been playing magic for almost a decade and I cared a lot about playing correctly for almost five years. However, I come from a household where spending a lot of time or money on a game was looked down upon, so I never had the chance to play competitively. I was fortunate enough to participate in one release event (got second place and a bunch of packs!) and one FNM (borrowed a friend's deck) which I remember were some of the most fun magic I've ever played. I think now that I'm in college, I can more easily decide how I want to spend my time and I want to give competitive magic a shot. I hope to be good enough to one day 4-0 a pauper daily event. However, I am also a busy person and I don't want to start up something I do not enough time to invest in. So I ask you spikes:

(TL;DR) How much time do you spend playtesting a week? How do you manage to fit time for magic into your daily schedules?

1359709132.0,24,self.spikes,17opym,"[Standard] GTC Naya discussion - Slots, curve, and new toys",27,3,59,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/17opym/standard_gtc_naya_discussion_slots_curve_and_new/,"If you're as excited as I was for GTC's release and more utility for my favorite two wedges (RWG and UWR), then you have noticed we have a handful of cards to work into our 75 cards.

I'm going to examine these cards in more of a midrange/""big"" style Naya list, i.e. we will be playing Huntmaster/Resto/Thrag/Hellkites as our bread and butter, farseeking and answering threats in the first few turns rather than presenting threats.

I'd like to start with the discussion on slots (will be organized by 1-drop, 2-drop, and so on)-

Lands -  Now that we have access to 3 different shocks, our farseeks will be able to fix better than ever before, and it does seem tempting to play 4 of each.  However, doing so makes aggro matches a bit tougher (RDW looks to be a big contender!)  I think playing 10 is probably about right, with about 10 more buddy lands, a basic or two, and 2-4 utility lands.

The utility lands that we have to work with are:
Cavern of Souls - Great vs a field of permission and in decks where it can fix well (i.e. humans)
Kessig Wolf Run - Pretty much an auto include, gives Naya the reach and ability to push through damage in the mid to late game
Gavony Township - Allows us to build board presence without overcommitting, synergizes well with huntmaster, a curve that is on the lower side and is better the more mana dorks you play 
Slayer's Stronghold - Makes topdecked creatures a threat, though many of our options already have haste (thundermaw, aurelia, ~resto angel)

***1 Drops***

Avacyn's Pilgrim - The old standby, always taps for mana, though W

Arbor Elf - With new GTC shocks, he improves immensely; does require a critical mass of Forest cards, which goes beyond playing the full 8 Forest shocks we have access to;  If you do decide to play him, I think 4-5 basic forests is reasonable.  

Pillar of Flame - Frankly, I'm not as much of a fan of this card, though it is a necessary evil in faster formats and there have been a few more 1 mana threats released w/ GTC (experiment one, boros elite, cloudfin raptor)  

***2 drop***

Farseek - It ramps, it fixes, it is one of the best things we can be doing on turn 2.  

Searing Spear - A versatile burn spell with many applications, killing hellrider before they reach combat, spearing a thragtusk in the mirror in response to resto angel trigger, last points of burn, etc

Selesnya Charm - A solid charm we have access to with 3 very relevant abilities.  In mid to late game, can be used in conjunction with wolf run to exile any nonhexproof.

Boros Charm - Another solid charm we have access to.  Again, all of the abilities are relevant, but overall, it seems less versatile (but more powerful) than Selesnya charm.  

***3 slot***

Boros Reckoner - Insane 3 drop, well costed, makes blocking much more complicated, and can profitably block thragtusk, hellrider, geralf's.  Somewhat of a 'combo' with Clan Defiance to burn them out.  Can be a little hard to cast.

Loxodon Smiter - Another great 3 drop we have access to, 4/4 for 3 is great; Really shines vs: Liliana, Blue, and Rakdos Return.

Centaur Healer - Generally not where you want to be.  Can make your aggro matchups a little easier, as it gives you some breathing room.  He is underwhelming in every other matchup.  Would rather play Loxodon Smiter in most cases.

Borderland Ranger - Almost required before GTC for fixing, something to think about if you want to get greedy and splash a 4th color.  Requires playing more basics (3-4) than you may want to.

***4 slot***

Restoration Angel - Format staple, archetype staple.  Blinking a thragtusk/ flipped huntmaster feels really unfair and allows you to extract so much value.  ""Counters"" targeted removal. Can be played end of opponents turn to give it quasi-haste.  

Huntmaster of the Fells - Archetype staple.  4 power across two bodies and 2 life the turn it comes in is already a good deal and when you add it's ability to flip, it puts a lot of pressure on your opponent.  You can also force your opponent to play around huntmaster flipping, which often leads to them using their cards less optimally than they might normally.  Not an automatic 4-of but if you aren't playing this card in this deck, why are you playing these colors?!

Hellrider - Not really the deck for it, Hellrider really shines in aggro w/ a bunch of 1-2 drops.  

Ghor-Clan Rampager - Another card that does a lot better in more aggressive decks.  I can see this doing well in R/G aggro or possibly even Naya aggro. 

Firemane Avenger - If we were to take away this card's battalion ability it would be unplayable, so the question is: How ~~easily~~ reliably can we activate battalion?  Not so reliably, has the same problem hell rider does in that it benefits from a lower curve.  There are far better options at the 4 slot.

***5 slot***

Thragtusk - Format Staple, Archetype staple.  Helps us stabilize, efficient beater, good vs wraths, one of the reasons to be playing Naya!

Thundermaw Hellkite - Haste, Aggressively costed, really difficult to block.  

Garruk, Primal Hunter - Often just draws us cards the turn he comes down, but don't underestimate clogging the board with 3/3s.

***6 slot***

Aurelia - Alone, she represents 6 damage on the turn she comes into play.  She works very well w/ pump effects.  If you have a decent board presence, she can end the game on the spot.  Verdict is still out, may be a win more card

Angelic Skirmisher -  May be a sleeper hit card, can affect the board the turn she comes down by allowing you to swing in w/ one of three relevant abilities (lifelink seems like the one you usually use, though all are good).  Seems nuts that you get an ability on each combat.  Again, verdict still out, could be too slow, but this is an incredibly powerful effect.  

***7 slot***

Angel of Serenity - One of the best ways to win a creature mirror between angel loops, exiling their board, or just returning thragtusks to your hand.  This is nearly always good, though it can be slow and sometimes hard to cast.


***XXXX slot***
Note* I was unsure where to include this on the curve, so it gets a category

Bonfire of the damned - If you've ever miracled a bonfire for a come-back victory, you know how good it feels.  This card is borderline unfair when it's miracled a lot of the time and even with Frontline medic and boros charm on the field now, you generally still want to play this.

Clan Defiance - Seems reasonable, at it's worst it's a devil's play w/ no buyback.  It's often going to have two targets and in some matchups it will be a '3 for 1'.  If you're playing w/ Boros reckoner, you can randomly kill them by targeting reckoner and your opponent for double damage.

Signal the Clans - So, for RG, you get to search your deck w/ 3 different creatures and randomly get one?  Seems like too much variance to be a worthy inclusion

Mizzium Mortars - I like this card a lot and it's a more 'reliable' bonfire that hits most of the field w/ a split cost.  However, it's much more difficult to cast overloaded and it can be a little too slow.

To be continued~~!

While my notes were somewhat difficult to read, I think I’ve managed to piece together most of the happenings after a long weekend of a PTQ yesterday, plus the Super IQ today.

With regards to the PTQ, I played almost the exact same 75 as below, with the exception of the land base… I started the day 4-0, then lost 3 heartbreakers in a row to knock myself out of prizes. I swore retribution for the next day, and well, I got it!

First of all, the deck list: (I’ll try to put a link here once its up on the Star City site… I don’t think the shop has finished reporting everything yet.)

&gt; 4 Avacyn’s Pilgrim

&gt; 4 Invisible Stalker

&gt; 4 Voice of Resurgence

&gt; 4 Geist of Saint Traft

&gt; 4 Fiendslayer Paladin

&gt; 2 Ajani, Caller of the Pride

&gt; 4 Rancor

&gt; 4 Ethereal Armor

&gt; 4 Spectral Flight

&gt; 4 Unflinching Courage

&gt; 4 Hallowed Fountain

&gt; 4 Temple Garden

&gt; 4 Breeding Pool

&gt; 2 Hinterland Harbor

&gt; 2 Sunpetal Grove

&gt; 2 Glacial Fortress

&gt; 2 Forest

&gt; 2 Plains

&gt; Sideboard:

&gt; 1 Sigarda, Host of Herons

&gt; 1 Nevermore

&gt; 1 Detention Sphere

&gt; 2 Negate

&gt; 2 Selesnya Charm

&gt; 2 Mending Touch

&gt; 3 Ray of Revelation

&gt; 3 Fog

Now that everyone hates me for playing Bant Hexproof with Voices main, after asking for your opinions and you telling me not to do it… Lets move into the rounds.

**Round 1: Bant Hexproof**

I win the die roll, and hit a turn 2 Geist of Saint Traft. He hits a turn 2 Voice of Resurgence with Ethereal Armor. We end up playing cat and mouse for a while with who’s dude is bigger and lifelinking for more. Eventually, I end up drawing into a third Ethereal Armor and getting enough to kill him. Game 2 he rolled over me after I couldn’t draw into a third land on a mull to five.  Game 3 ends up being another cat and mouse game until I have Negate and two Ray of Revelations in hand when he has lethal on board for the backswing. I blow him out by negating his second Armor, and using ray to hit his unflinching courage and rancor. My Avacyn’s Pilgrim that took that block died a hero, as it allowed me to swing back with a 12/12 Geist of Saint Traft to end the game.

*I win, 2-1 (1-0)*

**Round 2: Gruul Aggro**

My second round opponent is my friend Cy Cook. You may know him as the guy who popularized the Bant Evolve deck from a few months ago. Anyway, after winning the die roll, I proceed to hit a turn 2 Geist of Saint Traft, and then drop a ton of enchantments the next turn, followed up by a couple more the next. Game 2 I kept a somewhat shaky hand, without a second white source. I had a Pilgrim, Voice, Paladin and a few rancors and a spectral flight. Sure enough, my pilgrim gets pillared, and Cy proceeds to kill me with Hellriders before I can stabilize. I end up drawing an Unflinching Courage when he has me at three life. Dying to Hellrider triggers if I don’t equip and swing, I make the best play I can to get me to survive a turn at 1 life. He ends up dropping a second Hellrider, and I quickly begin to shuffle up for game 3. Game 3 I end up hitting the nut turn 2 GoST draw and kill him by turn 4.  We talk a bit about the match and how the rest of our days went at the PTQ the day before,

*I win, 2-1 (2-0)*

**Round 3: Gruul Aggro**

My third round opponent is the guy who handed me my second loss of the previous day’s PTQ, so I knew I had to win or I’d just beat myself up. This match was fairly uneventful. I managed to hit the nut draw both games, while he sputtered on one red source.  He seemed pretty annoyed that I had beat him, though when I told him we’d have to settle the series in the top 8, he lightened up a bit. Unfortunately for him, he didn’t make the top 8.

*I win, 2-0 (3-0)*

**Round 4: Bant Evolve**

My opponent for this round is a member of my team/playtesting group. We’re both very familiar with each other’s decks, so this ends up being a very good back and forth battle for Game 1. We end up getting each other down to just a few life, but I end up ripping my Unflinching Courage to put me over the top. Game 2 did not start well for either of us, as we both hand to mulligan to five. Unfortunately for my friend, my five included two land, Pilgrim, GoST, and an Ethereal Armor.  After top decking runner-runner enchantments I roll over him. 

*I win, 2-0 (4-0)*

**Round 5: Selesnya Hexproof**

This round I get to play against the guy who knocked my previous round opponent out of the PTQ the previous day on their win-and-in game. He also almost got DQ’d on a slow play call from what I heard through the grapevine. That being said, this match didn’t really end well for me. It quite honestly came down to the die roll and a well-timed Pacifism on my lone non-hexproof, non-mana dork creature. I’m not sure if I lost this match 1-2 or 0-2, as my scorepad had run out at this point. I do know that I lost this round though. More on my opponent’s deck later…

*I lose, 0-2 (4-1)*

**Round 6: America Control**

After doing some math, it appears as though both my opponent and I can still split into the top 8, despite my losing the previous round. This was my opponent’s first “big” tournament, and had no clue how the whole tiebreakers thing worked. After explaining to him that since his tiebreakers were better than mine, he was 99% guaranteed to make it, while I was more on the order of 95% to make it. He thought about it for a bit, and he agreed to split in. It was a risky split for me, but I felt good about it. We decided to play just for fun anyway. I ended up beating him both games we played very quickly. After the games, he told me that today was not only his first time playing in a “big” tournament, but it was his first time with this deck. I let out a chuckle and congratulated him on the top 8. 

*We split! ID (4-1-1)*

After what seemed like an eternity, the head judge announces the top 8. I end up finishing 7th through the swiss, and my round 6 opponent ends up finishing 8th. We both made it! I was actually kind of nervous about the split after I had turned in the match slip. A few other players who I know well told me that it was extremely risky and actually could have ended up screwing them out of the top 8. He told me that there wouldn’t be hard feelings if it did screw him, but to talk with him first. I thought that was a bit of a dick move, and he later apologized for it. I also thought “Screw him. I can ID if I want to. If it knocks him out, then that’s his fault for not playing better!”
Going into the Top 8, we take a vote to chop the $1000 purse. The vote fails, so we play it out. The head judge tells us there’s another vote at Top 4. We get handed a couple IQ dice, playmats, and a Top 8 pin, and then we get our quarterfinal opponents.

**TOP 8 Quarterfials: Naya Midrange(?)**

I end up winning the die roll (for some reason, we didn’t do high seed is on the play), and then proceed to curve out quite nicely. My opponent sputters on mana game one, and I finish him off quickly with Geist. Game 2 I keep a hand of 2 Temple Gardens, a Hallowed Fountain, a Geist of Saint Traft, 2 Ethereal Armors, and an Avacyn’s Pilgrim. I then proceed to top deck Ethereal Armor on turn 2 and Unflinching Courage on turn 3. Needless to say, this game didn’t last very long. My opponent congratulated me, and then he stuck around to see who took the tournament down. He was also one of the judge’s rides, so that would explain it. 

*I win! 2-0 (5-1-1)*

As we headed into the Top 4, we get asked again if we want to do a cash split. This time, the four of us come to an agreement and each walk away with $200 cash.

**TOP 8 Semifinals: America Control**

My opponent this round is the aforementioned dude who yelled at me for taking the risky split in. Since I’m not really favored in this match, I immediately start to shrink back a bit. It also didn’t help that he had like 20 guys behind him watching him play, and I had like 2. He ends up getting me game one pretty good. His deck should have been called Answers.dek. It was ridiculous. After some banter back and forth between games, I notice that I’ve got a lot more people behind me now. I don’t know if this affected me subconsciously or not, but game two ended up falling in my favor. Answers.dek became ThinkTwice.dek, because that’s really all he did. We banter a bit more,  asking each other if we want to concede. Game three is a much faster version of game two, as he doesn’t manage to get much of anything going, and gets stuck on one white source. 

*I win! 2-1 (6-1-1)*

**TOP 8 FINALS: “Barely Boros” Exalted**

Holy shit. I made it to the finals! This was my first “big” tournament Top 8, so I wasn’t expecting to get this far.  My opponent for this round is one of my friends and a playtest/teammate. Game 1, I win the die roll and the Fiendslayer Paladin show begins. Seriously, this guy was doing work on both sides of the table. I end up getting him down to three life while getting myself up to 25 life. He then proceeds to either top deck or otherwise windmill slam a Silverblade Paladin on the table and pair it with the Fiendslayer. He swings in with a 10/10 double striker. I misplay and don’t block with my Pilgrim but I end up scooping them up instead. Game 2 is more of the first game, but this time with a lot more going in my favor. I finish him off with a 16/16 flying, first striking, trampling, and lifelinking GoST. Between games we banter a bit while shuffling, saying how awesome it was to be in the finals. Luckily for me, he ran out of gas very quickly, and I managed to draw nothing but. I finish him off with a massive Fiendslayer Paladin and two invisible stalkers.

*I WIN! 2-1 (7-1-1)*

I hate to post another Hydra brew, but this deck took 2nd at the open in NJ yesterday, and I have to say, I'm interested.

http://sales.starcitygames.com//deckdatabase/displaydeck.php?DeckID=57863

(List will be posted in comments for those of you who cannot click atm!)

In a nutshell, the deck is a stompy green deck w/ 12 dorks (16 w/ archdruid), visionaries to cantrip, big green derpy bombs end the game.

My friend handed me his mono-green variant, running 8 dorks, 4 predator ooze, 3 yeva, 3 scavenging ooze, 4 hydra, etc. It was not running visionaries or pilgrims, which was the major difference. I played the build, but didn't like a few things - namely, losing my win-a-box in round 3 to bonfire (he bonfired all 3 games, first was a miracle for 2 to kill my archdruid and dork) and the lack of consistency without dorks. 

I really enjoyed playing the deck, despite it's blatant weaknesses to early dork kills/bonfire blowouts. UWR decks aren't fast enough to deal with the dorks before we play something relevant (read: thragtusk, garruk, vorapede). It doesn't immediately out-value aggro decks, but they don't really interact with us, allowing our turn 4-5 plays to turn the game around. Predator ooze is incredibly mean against aggro, as well.

With the main weaknesses being dork vulnerability and lack of consistency, I made a couple of my own changes to the deck and intend on playtesting/building this week. Here is my current list and card choice explanations:

http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/1ja26c/standard_monogreen_township/cbclzom

(List will be posted in comments for those of you who cannot click atm!)

4 Arbor Elf

4 Elvish Mystic

4 Elvish Archdruid

3 Thragtusk

4 Garruk, Caller of Beasts

3 Craterhoof Behemoth

11 Forest

4 Farseek

4 Temple Garden

2 Gavony Township

4 Sunpetal Grove

2 Cavern of Souls

3 Elvish Visionary

2 Avacyn's Pilgrim

4 Restoration Angel

2 Kalonian Hydra

SB: 4 Scavenging Ooze

SB: 2 Plummet

SB: 3 Acidic Slime

SB: 3 Ranger's Guile

SB: 2 Tree of Redemption

SB: 1 Sigarda, Host of Herons

SB: 1 Selesnya Charm

Card choices:

- Farseek - I think farseek belongs in any deck that wants to reliably ramp. This deck, however, was initially mono-green, making Farseek unplayable. I wanted Farseek in the deck. It's the only playable 2cmc non-creature ramp spell in standard, and I needed a way to add it. While I didn't want to change the list that much, I figured out how to do it without causing much trouble - spell lands.

- Temple Garden/Gavony Township - Continuing from my previous point, I picked white and Gavony Township as my answer to the Farseek question. Township powers up dorks. The deck isn't very strained on mana (it's double colored).

- Craterhoof Behemoth - You can play it through Garruk to play around counters. Usually, when you get this guy to resolve, you win the game that turn. He's stupid strong and very easy to get to. 3 might be the correct number, as 4 might be too many, but I always want to see this guy at some point.

- 4 new Garruk - when 50% of your deck is creatures, casting Lead the Stampede every turn is brutal card advantage. Cast this versus control when they tap out, ALWAYS. This card is bonkers in this deck. If it goes unanswered, it's very hard to lose.

- Acidic Slimes - This is here for greedy mana decks and hexproof. If we ramp into t3 slime and slime their land, they're going to be in a really bad spot unless they farseeked the turn before.

- Scavenging Ooze - These come in versus reanimator (duh), but they can come in versus a myriad of other decks. I like siding out 5-drops for these against creature-heavy strategies (Naya, Gruul) and any deck with bonfires (1-2 dorks move out). Ooze is really powerful against creature decks. It gets out of hand very fast.

- Plummet - This deck straight up folds to Olivia Voldaren/Angel of Serenity/Most fliers. This is our cheese tech (and it worked well for me this weekend).

- Selesnya charm - good vs things

- Tree of Redemption - tech vs aggro

This deck has a good matchup against aggro decks, UWR, aristocrats (from what I've played already). I intend on testing this more and returning with results.

I'm want to examine new ways to take advantage of the land besides Elfball (though it is a significant boost to this deck). Examining the current top decks, there's nothing you can just toss cradle into and call it a day, so we're looking to either upgrade a T2/T3 deck or spawn a new archetype.

We need something that meets the following criteria:

* Can reasonably expect multiple creatures in the early stages of the game
* Has an outlet for possibly large amounts of mana
* Elfball is probably the best combo deck for this land, therefore we need to be hyperaggressive or have some form of disruption

Things that come to mind:

* **Natural Order deck (Maverick?)**
* Lets us include Garruk, Caller of Beasts
* Knight of the Reliquary can be absurd with it
* **Slivers**
* Could Cradle give it an edge over Fish? My gut feeling is no.
* Could include NO package here, too
* **Some manner of Nic Fit**
* Not sure creature presence is consistent enough

So these are my thoughts. I don't have near enough time as I would like to brew and test, so I was hoping I could get some insight into where I should start and which cards are worth considering. So far all I'm liking is Garruk, Caller of Beasts supplementing a NO package as a 1-2 of.

Top 16 is fantastic, but still room for improvement. I see three avenue's for improvement:

1)Splash white for a bigger beater. UWR geist decks all tend to b either heavily aggro focused, utilizing steppe lynx, or midrangy, utilizing restoration angel. While the white splash would give us access to a huge variety of sideboard options, I feel we would lose one of the biggest advantages Jeff's deck had moving through the rounds, Blood Moon. BM alone, as per Jeff's report, wins games, and consdering the greedy manabases of jund, pod, and UWR, the lose of BM would be a mistake.

2)Finding more pressure in UR. Delver is a nice clock, should he flip, which is inconsistant considering the lack of good cantrip/scry effects. Jeff ran two telling time as an instant speed set up, which is fantastic in conjunction with a turn 1 delver, but still means there is no set up for him until t3, hooping that your opponent plays nothing counter worthy on their second turn. My houghts turn to the new addition, Young Pyromancer, whose legacy counter magic (FOW and daze) make him a monster of a clock. With no daze in modern, or efficient free counter, protecting him the turn he comes down becomes problematic. If he sticks, I have found, he runs away with the game, a second one tends to seal the deck, speeding up the your clock while countering or removing threats. Considering he works so well with delver and snapcaster, he is highly appealing. Testing him, he remains strong, but only with the right answers backing him up. However, he does take a creature slot, and is only cast at sorcery speed, forcing the deck into a bit more main phase play.

3)Which leads into the thrd path, changing the spell suite to something a little more controlling. Spell snare is fantastic in some matches, but an absolute dud in others. Spell pierce is something I have been mulling over as a MB spell, as I have used it in merfolk with great success. The low land count, which enables drawing into more gas and is enabled by the low curve, pushes me away from Cryptic, which helps shore up a lot of problems thanks to the swiss army knife applications.

Jeff proved that a strong aggro/control deck can emere from this meta, and I think it can become Tier 1. A fresh mind behind this might be able to toss in some ideas I have missed, so what are your thoughts? Any ideas on what I have already preseted, or any ideas in general on competitive aggro/control and where it could emerge?",,False,,t5_2utkz,False,,,True,t3_1i5p7h,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/1i5p7h/modern_crafting_aggrocontrol/,
1373041730.0,23,self.spikes,1hp4ns,[Standard] Naya - Bonfire vs. Mizzium Mortars,26,3,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/1hp4ns/standard_naya_bonfire_vs_mizzium_mortars/,"With M14 fast approaching, the Naya decks that have been doing well recently have started to diversify themselves from the original Domri Naya list that got people interested it the archetype again. I'll be taking some version of [this list](http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/naya-beatsticks/) (probably minus Silverblades) to SCG: Worcester tomorrow.

In [the comments of his GP Miami report](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/26457_Birthday-Wishes-Do-Come-True-GP-Miami-6th.html), Peter Ingram is asked why he plays 3 Bonfire instead of Mortars. He concludes his reply with ""Personally, I can't see why anyone would run Mortars over Bonfire, but that's just me."" [Mark Eilers](http://www.gatheringmagic.com/inside-the-deck-rich-castle-video-07022013-grand-prix-miami/) also included 4 Bonfires in his Domri-less take on Naya, which more resembles Jund with its Farseek -&gt; high-impact spell strategy. Brian Kibler also lists Bonfire at #1 on his list of cards you should be playing. 

Are these people right? Is this the direction these decks have taken proper? In my own testing, I do find myself boarding in my 2 Bonfire often, but I'm rarely unhappy to have the option to do 4 damage to a single creature, and the Overload cost often has a Plague Wind effect since there are not terribly many 5+ toughness creatures running about (Hellkite and Angel of Serenity being major exceptions, Obzedat being a somewhat irrelevant exception). My main reason for leaving Bonfire in the board was expecting a lot of UWR, which Bonfire is somewhat mediocre against (Mortars at least clears out Augur/Resto), and Boros Reckoner decks, which make a large Bonfire somewhat awkward. I've found myself bringing in Bonfire against the Reckoner decks anyway, though, so that argument may not be as strong as I thought.

So I wanted to try something new in Modern and came up with this (now a link instead of a terrible looking attempt at a list):

http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/gw-vengevine-25-06-13-1/

This is an engine deck, the core being made up of 4 each of Vengevine, Squadron Hawks, and Fauna Shaman.

On their own, the Hawks are underpowered. However, they can create busted starts by allowing you to discard Vengevines at end of turn. They also ensure that you never run out of creatures to trigger the Vengevines. 

After the core 12 cards, the question becomes ""how do I make Squadron Hawks into real threats?"" I don't have swords on my MTGO account, although they are certainly an option (but they make lead the stampede worse). So, I went with Wilt-Lief Liege. This of course led to the Smiters and Finks (I don't own Voices). The Lieges also do a pretty good job of making the mana dorks into threats, especially when combined with Gavony Township. 

Lead the Stampede is awesome in this deck. The deck has 31 creatures, and hitting 3 or 4 is not uncommon. It creates great card advantage. Anyone who has ever cast Goblin Ringleader in Legacy knows how powerful the effect is. 

Is this deck Tier 1? Certainly not. But after a day of testing, I can tell you that it holds its own pretty well against the major archetypes in the field. If you want to try something different in Modern, or if you feel like picking up a ""little kid"" deck with an engine, give it a try. 

So, r/spikes, what are your suggestions?

Thanks.

1371424476.0,22,self.spikes,1ghbad,[Standard] Grixis Control ft. Master of Cruelties. Can this get to tier 1?,28,6,64,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/1ghbad/standard_grixis_control_ft_master_of_cruelties/,"I've been toying around with Grixis control for awhile, but never quite got it to work.  I think the missing piece may have been pushing black hard enough that mutilate was reliable.  I'm sitting at 16 swamps now, and I seem to be getting away with the limited red and blue mana, while consistently hitting enough swamps for mutilate to get it's job done.  Aetherling and Jace are the only things that ever feel restricted on mana, but its not so bad with thinks and alchemies.  Here's what I'm working with now.

**Creatures:**

* 1 AEtherling
* 2 Master of Cruelties
* 2 Snapcaster Mage
* 3 Vampire Nighthawk

**Instants:**

* 3 Forbidden Alchemy
* 3 Searing Spear
* 4 Think Twice

**Sorceries:**

* 3 Mutilate
* 3 Dreadbore
* 4 Pillar of Flame

**Planeswalkers:**

* 2 Chandra, the Firebrand
* 2 Jace, Architect of Thought
* 2 Liliana of the Veil
* 1 Tamiyo, the Moon Sage

**Lands:**

* 4 Blood Crypt
* 2 Rogue's Passage
* 4 Steam Vents
* 3 Sulfur Falls
* 8 Swamp
* 4 Watery Grave

**Sideboard:**

* 3 Slaughter Games
* 3 Negate
* 1 Dreadbore
* 2 Rolling Temblor
* 1 Mutilate
* 2 Devour Flesh
* 2 Olivia Voldaren
* 1 Rakdos's Return

The Master of Cruelties package seems questionable, but I've been impressed with how well it has performed.  The rogue's passages make him operate like a combo, winning straight away with a burn spell or chandra.  It's not a game breaking combo, but it can win games out of no where.  He can also swing for the win with Chandra or Pillar and passage on turn 6.  Additionally, he is a very strong blocker for any of the other lines of play and can't be removed with pillar, spear, price, or selesnya charm.

The deck can also win with aetherling, or just planeswalker critical mass.  I've even had a few games go to me off of chandra cloning burn spells with a lonely nighthawk.  You can slide into the super friends style of inevitability control with powerful removal and walkers.
I've had a ton of luck playing on cockatrice, but I haven't had a chance to assemble this in person and get good data on tier 1 match ups.  

Is there anything in the tier 1 meta that is just going to completely blow me out?  I feel like the removal package is very strong against aggro match ups, and the super friends package is pretty good against control.  I'd love to hear some thoughts or feedback about how this list would do in a tier 1 meta.",,False,,t5_2utkz,1371424996.0,,,True,t3_1ghbad,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/1ghbad/standard_grixis_control_ft_master_of_cruelties/,
1369796467.0,23,self.spikes,1f8ucp,[Standard] Building a Better Plasm Capture,32,9,59,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/1f8ucp/standard_building_a_better_plasm_capture/,"Unfortunately, Gerry Thompson will not be sharing his thoughts with you today as you may remember his article series from last format with the same name. As the title implies, today I'm going to be discussing my attempts to make the expensive, color-intensive Mana Drain known as Plasm Capture work in standard. First, we must ask ourselves a very important. Why are we trying to a force a GGUU counterspell to work in Standard?

Right now midrange archetypes such as Junk reanimator, UWr flash/control, Jund, and Bant are integral parts of the format. These decks usually win by fending off early threats for the first couple of turns and then resolving 4-6 mana win conditions to try and seal the game. Plasm Capture excels against this general strategy. Counter their large threat, untap, play your own large threat for free, hold up burn/countermagic for their next turn.

Against control decks, Plasm Capture can hard counter similar to Dissipate, but during your turn you get extra mana to try to force through a second threat if your first one is countered or dealt with in some way. The Plasm Capture decks in general are built to support a large number of win conditions to Plasm Capture into, so you can usually outnumber their answers with the number of threats you have.

Aggro seems to be the worst matchup for Plasm Capture judging by my current testing. Plasm Capture and your other countermagic is completely dead game one. As I mentioned before, the Plasm Capture deck usually wants to play a stacked high end, so you may be too slow to compete with decks like Naya Blitz. The other half of your deck has to be catered to win this matchup.

Being placed into U/G gives us some powerful tools to begin with. For example:

* Farseek for ramp and mana fixing. Enables a turn 3 Plasm Capture which can be important.
* Augur of Bolas for stall/spell search. Snapcaster Mage is a powerful tool like Augur that also fulfills this role.
* Thragtusk.
* Aetherling is the most resilient bomb this deck can have against control archetypes.
* Garruk, Primal Hunter and Jace, Memory Adept for hard to deal with planeswalker pressure.
* Progenitor Mimic and Prime Speaker Zegana are interesting U/G finishers for this type of deck.

Let's start with the possible shells that you could put Plasm Capture into. It's pretty much narrowed it down to 3 colors, because 4 is pushing it with UUGG in your deck. Each 3rd color gives powerful removal and bombs to supplement Plasm Capture, but all serve unique purposes. So what are the pros and cons of each combination?

Bant:

* Reliable board sweeper in Supreme Verdict.
* Powerful bombs in Angel of Serenity and Restoration Angel.
* Instant speed tricks with Advent of the Wurm.
* Azorius Charm and Sphinx's Revelation.

RUG:

* Ral Zarek is a promising 4 drop in this style of deck because the deck is pretty mana intensive.
* Quality burn with Mizzium Mortars, Searing Spear, and Pillar of Flame.
* More midrange hate with Turn // Burn.
* Huntmaster as a mid-game stabilizer.
* Niv-Mizzet Dracogenius as a good card advantage game winner.

BUG:

* Best single target removal with Putrefy and Warped Physique. Also Far // Away.
* Mutilate as a possible board wipe.
* Discard package option.
* Griselbrand as the most “raw power” finisher on this list.
* Reap Intellect? Seems janky.

While I think that Bant probably has the most potential (drawing similarities between a Bant Flash / Prime Speaker Bant hybrid), I have personally been testing with [this RUG list](/http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/rug-plasm-capture/). This list also experiments with a lot of new technology, including Ral Zarek and Progenitor Mimic. I find Mimic really sways the reanimator matchup and putting it on a Thragtusk of our own is *pretty* strong. Ral Zarek has been alright for me as a fancy double Lightning Bolt, but it seems to be outclassed by Huntmaster even though this deck can use it’s +1 to ramp effectively.  I’ve been having some mediocre results against aggro, but I’ve been tinkering with Augur of Bolas, Huntmaster and the burn suite to find the best combination to stall out the early game until you can hit 5 mana.

I’m playing about 10 bombs (cards 5+ mana), 7 early/midgame stabilizers, 8 burn spells, 5 counterspells, and then 2 think twice/ 3 farseek. I’m not sure any of these ratios are necessarily correct, to be honest. I’m pretty sure that from my list, I could cut the Ral Zareks for more Huntmasters to have a better aggro matchup without having to cut as much top end. I think there is some rationale behind moving a Garruk to the side and replacing it with the fourth Farseek. I wish these colors had a board wipe better than Magmaquake/Rolling Temblor, because I’m not sure they’re good enough to stop the aggressive decks (although I haven’t played them very much in other decks). Wolfir Avengers in the side should probably just be two of the formerly mentioned “board wipes” because you can hit them off of Augur.

Sorry for the little personal rant at the end, I’m just trying to figure this archetype out. I'll update this post with ""proof of concept"" Bant and BUG lists when I can. I've only played about 3-4 minor FNM/Game Day tournaments with this deck so far, but I'll be happy to answer any questions you have. Wondering what you guys think and I would love to hear from other people trying to work on Plasm Capture strategies. Hope you enjoyed.

Some notes on the list:

- A good friend (Jaberwocki) ran the list to a top 4 finish at a PTQ a few weeks ago on MTGO, but I feel there's still improvements to be made, especially for the paper build I have listed.

- Talking matchup-wise, Gifts Control (why the hell is this common where I'm at?) just folds half the time to Liliana and the heavy discard + smallpox package, most control matchups are slightly favored from testing. Aggro builds, especially the gruul lists are rough simply because of how absurdly fast they are, so I'd look to shore up those as well if possible. Tarmogoyfs are the obvious fix here and I'd probably borrow them if I need to. Combo matchups are pretty damn good as well even if twin is still consistent as hell. The only outright awful matchups from play is tron which is just frustrating when they stick a turn 3 karn through the hate and take over the whole game, and kiki pod who has answers for everything apparently. Dredgevine is just awful without hate as they just ride my engine and kill me with it.

- The single Temple Garden is for Ray of Revelation in the sideboard. I absolutely need Ray just because of how much Rest in Peace and Leyline of Sanctity hurts, and it seems most of the players here have it in the sideboard, so it's a necessity. I'd love maelstrom pulse but if it's loamed away it's useless whereas Ray is useful whether it gets stuck in the hand/I have a fetch or I mill it.

- Smallpox is amazing tech. If I have the lands, T2 Smallpox with a Life from the Loam waiting in the wings can take games over really damn fast. Teach you to keep a greedy hand of only two lands, Merfolk player.

- There's three different archetypes that are rather common here: Affinity, Burn, and Tron, so a playset of Ancient Grudge and maybe some Dragon's Claws might shore up the first two matchups, but the third one gives me a headache. 4x Relic mainboard is rough to fight when they start exiling your stuff all the time.

* I built the list with more hand destruction in mind simply because of Inquisition being one of the best discard spells in the format, and in some matchups I'd argue it's simply superior to Thoughtseize, especially the aforementioned burn and affinity MUs.

I'll get to the point here, but what do you guys feel on the viability of aggro loam? And what would probably be some good cards for the side outside of Ancient Grudge, Pyroclasm, Ray of Revelation, Dragon's Claw, and maybe some more Ghost Quarters vs Tron? And I assume the usual graveyard hate will be useful, but which one? Grafdigger's Cage stops their recursion (and mine), but I can eventually kill them with Flame Jab or SS triggers. Tormod's Crypt is free, but eh. Relic of Progenitus is excellent, but passably bad for me when I exile my own Loams and lands just for the sake of stopping Vengevine from coming back.

I don't have a refined decklist yet but I thought I would discuss it with you all. I'll lay down what I consider to be the most important pillars of the deck. We can discuss whether it can be truly competitive and if so, what can make it that way.    
   
**Planeswalkers** - This is obviously the most important part of a Super Friends deck. If you aren't familiar, the definition of a Super Friends deck is basically that the Planeswalkers do most of the work. You get a few on the board that synergize well together and they do work every turn. For the most part, the deck should be built around protecting and enabling these guys.    
    
* [Ajani Vengeant](http://magiccards.info/ddh/en/1.html) - His +1 make a mana problem for an opponent crippling. It can hurt RG Tron by keeping Urza lands down. It can lockdown powerful creatures. His -2 is good for staying in the game and spot removal. His ultimate wins the game.    
* [Elspeth, Knight-Errant](http://magiccards.info/ddf/en/1.html) - Her first +1 makes chumps to protect our friends and in combination with her other +1, can be a game winner if the board is empty, perhaps after a Supreme Verdict. Her ult is decent in weird circumstances, but it's usually better to just keep producing blockers or enabling powerful attackers.    
* [Gideon Jura](http://magiccards.info/m12/en/16.html) - His +2 protects our other friends, and he can take a few since he hits the board with 6 loyalty counters, which will be 8 if you start with his +2. His -2 is situational but can work well with Ajani.  His neutral ability can be a game winner if the board is clear.    
* [Jace Beleren](http://magiccards.info/m11/en/58.html) - Card advantage up the ass. I usually alternate between the +2 and the -1 but the ultimate can serve as an alt win condition.
* [Jace, Architect of Thought](http://magiccards.info/rtr/en/44.html) - Is more resilient than Beleren thanks to higher loyalty counter start and his +1 as he hits the field. Also better against aggro and midrange compared to Beleren. Thanks pgan91 for suggesting Jace, Architect of Thought.
* [Venser, the Sojourner](http://magiccards.info/ddi/en/1.html) - His +2 lets me ""reset"" my walkers and repeat ETB effects  on my creatures. Thanks to TrollKnight for suggesting Venser, the Sojourner.     
    
**Counterspells** - These serve the important purposes of disrupting the opponent's early to mid game and protecting our walkers. Most of these will be fairly obvious choices so don't feel bad for skipping my descriptions.     
    
* [Mana Leak](http://magiccards.info/m12/en/63.html) - One of my favorite counterspells ever printed. Very popular for a reason. Very cheap, splashable, and it's usually effective.    
* [Spell Snare](http://magiccards.info/di/en/33.html) - Cheap as hell (nice with Snapcaster) and works wonders against so many decks. Kills a Tarmogoyf, Dark Confidant, Lightning Helix, Tribal Flames (common in my meta), Mana Leak, Remand, Dreadbore, etc.    
* [Spell Pierce](http://magiccards.info/zen/en/67.html) - Weaker of the counterspells, but still great for early game disruption. Stops common turn 1 plays like Serum Visions and a lot of burn spells like Lightning Bolt.    
* [Mindbreak Trap](http://magiccards.info/zen/en/57.html) - Free counters occasionally, and makes RG Tron matchup better pre-sideboard since I can counter Emrakul. Probably weakest and may not make it in the deck.
    
**Removal** - Once again, these choices will be obvious so feel free to skim or skip. These are important for wiping out any and all important creatures the opponent controls.     
    
* [Lightning Bolt](http://magiccards.info/pd2/en/17.html) - Simple and classic. One mana for three damage is great value. I usually find myself using this on early-game utility creatures like Bob and Deathrite. I can also save it to zap attackers after I've gotten a walker down so they can build up counters and be safe.      
* [Path to Exile](http://magiccards.info/ddi/en/23.html) - Stupidly good removal. Nullifies undying/persist (usually Kitchen Finks) and indestructible creatures. Really don't have to explain this great card. It serves no special purpose in this deck aside from being cheap so I can cast it early.    
* [Lightning Helix](http://magiccards.info/ddh/en/23.html) - Keeps me from suffering against fast decks and serves as removal. Three-toughness creatures aren't that common in Modern as far as my experience goes (Vexing Devil, Vengevine, and early Goyf), but it's value.  
* [Wrath of God](http://magiccards.info/10e/en/61.html) - Relatively cheap boardwipe that goes over the occasional regenerate creature like Lotleth Troll.    
* [Supreme Verdict](http://magiccards.info/rtr/en/201.html) - Bit more color heavy but shouldn't be a problem. ""can't be countered"" is pretty relevant (probably moreso than ""they can't be regenerated"") so I think this is the better boardwipe for this deck.    
* [Electrolyze](http://magiccards.info/cmd/en/197.html) - There are plenty of valuable one or two power creatures seeing play in Modern, so this could be a possibility. The option to distribute the damage means I'll occasionally hit the face with a bit, which can make a difference. Card draw is the icing on the cake. Killing a Dark Confidant, hitting the opponent with one to the face, and drawing is a great feeling.
    
**Creatures** - Super Friends decks are usually light on the creatures. The only ones I would consider are ones that serve a very important purpose.     
    
* [Snapcaster Mage](http://magiccards.info/isd/en/78.html) - the only creature I would definitely include in this deck. He's cheap, has a relevant power of 2, and when flashed in has plenty of cheap targets with my countespells and removal.    
* [Wall of Omens](http://magiccards.info/cmd/en/37.html) - Might be strong because of generating card advantage and having a good toughness to slow down aggro significantly.     
* [Sun Titan](http://magiccards.info/m12/en/39.html) - Good finisher with relevant things to recur like Snapcaster, Wall of Omens, Vendillion Clique, Jace, and Tectonic Edge and Phantasmal Image if I include them. Thanks to aspect0 for suggesting Sun Titan.    
* [Vendilion Clique](http://magiccards.info/mt/en/55.html) - Good for neutering combos or just hurting your opponent's game plan. Can also get a decent amount of damage in with 3 power and evasion. The flying can also be good on the defense for protecting my walkers against fliers since it trades high, although it will more commonly be wasted on 1/1 token from Lingering Souls.
    
    
I have left out lands and sideboard options, but I think this should suffice for now. Those are the cards I see as having potential in an American Super Friends deck for Modern. From you I'm looking for:    
    
* Do you see any cards that should be included that aren't? Why would they be valuable to this deck?    
* Do you see a card here that you don't see as having a place in a deck like this? Why do you see it as being too weak?    
* Do you think a deck like this can be competitive and why?    
* Do you have any questions you'd like to ask me?     
    
Thank you for reading!

2012 was the first year I started playing competitive magic. I cleared a small sum of cash from a series of decent finishes on the SCG circuit and tax time is coming up...

Any one out there who has paid taxes on prize money in the past know if it is possible to write off travel expenses (hotel, gas) and entry fees against the amount of money I won? As we all know those checks are far from pure profit. Links to resources that explain in detail are always good!

For instance I know whenever I cleared enough money playing poker in a year to get taxed on I was allowed to write off what I lost that same year up to the amount that I won.

G1 always feels like an uphill battle. If I don't come swinging out of the gates with a nut draw (T1 flipped delver, 2 Phantasmal Bears, etc) I feel like I'm drowning in his CA as soon as T3 hits and he lands a Compulsive Research/Mulldrifter. Post sideboard is much better, I have lots of spell hate and Hydroblast. Stormbound Geist is also a major beating vs decks that rely on red removal. That said, Izzet-post gets Pyroblast so it's not that much better.

The current method I'm trying is counter only his removal and Mulldrifters because if he can't kill my guys and he has no blockers I can eventually grind through the game as Izzet-post only has like 2-3 actual threats in the deck. Problem is, they just ramp and wait until they have enough mana to play 2-3 spells in a turn. My new plan is to counter their draw spells to keep them out of gas, since if we both go to topdeck mode I have more threats than they have answers. Since Storm and Infect are dead Izzet-post no longer has any bad MUs so this stuff might be good to look at. Anybody have any insight?

TLDR: As a Delver player I feel like my Izzet-post MU is balls. Help.

Edit: So I've tried several different things, including the suggestions and here, and this is what I've found. Even on my best aggressive hands I can't punch through Glimmerpost. Every one they drop ends up being a Time Walk. I've had a little more success using Delvers/Bears/Ninjas to eat all their removal, counter their card draw, and then go over the top with Spire Golems/Stormbound Geists/Weatherseed Faeries. 

Alternatively, you can SB in 4 Curse of the Bloody Tomes and try and throw them off by forcing them into the beatdown. Sticking one does little, but sticking 2 is a very real clock. If you can stick 2 in a timely manner your odds are decent. ",,False,,t5_2utkz,1360025475.0,,,True,t3_17oc8s,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/17oc8s/pauper_monoblue_delver_vs_izzetpost/,

We initially wanted to just go double Dimir, and try to just mill one opponent out before they can do anything about it, but, at least where we will be playing, we are not allowed to use the same guild.

I was still considering one of us using Dimir, and maybe being able to get there with a mill strategy—we have a shared card pool, so we might be able to get enough for it to work. The other player could focus on suppressing the board, maybe with Orzhov, or just beefing up defenses with Simic.

Thought people would get a kick out of seeing it.",29,7,34,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/11grxg/5_color_seance_list_16th_place_at_colorado_states/,"So a few weeks ago, my team and I started to work on a green-based Seance build. Our initial list was almost a land destruction deck, with 4x Acidic Slime and 4x Bramblecrush mainboard, with creatures like Armada Wurm and Restoration Angel to provide the beats. We kept making improvements, deciding we could easily go 5 colors, and it evolved into this list, which got me to 16th place (out of 176) at Colorado States:

  Deck  


4 Restoration Angel

2 Disciple of Bolas

4 Thragtusk

2 Acidic Slime

2 Armada Wurm

3 Centaur Healer

2 Sever the Bloodline

2 Seance

4 Farseek

3 Mana Bloom

3 Supreme Verdict

3 Oblivion Ring

2 Forbidden Alchemy

4 Forest

3 Sunpetal Grove

3 Hallowed Fountain

3 Temple Garden

2 Hinterland Harbor

4 Overgrown Tomb

1 Blood Crypt

2 Steam Vents

2 Woodland Cemetary

SB

1 Thundermaw Hellkite

3 Sundering Growth

3 Slaughter Games

3 Negate

1 Angel of Serenity

2 Zealous Conscripts

2 Garruk

The amount of synergy in this list is pretty high. Card draw and card selection wins you games, its as simple as that; with Thragtusk and Disciple and Restoration Angel my life really never dipped below 14 or so for too long, and Disciple would routinely draw me 3-5 cards, multiple times in a game. Hard to lose with that much card advantage. 

Farseek and Mana Bloom make going 5 colors fairly easy; I would almost never have any problems casting spells in my hand, though occasionally making sure I had the mana to cast blue and/or black spells in my hand, while still trying to ramp up to Armada Wurm made things difficult. Pulled it off fairly well, though.  

Overall thoughts on my list: Alchemy was a night-before-states change after seeing a teammate do well with it, and it's SPECTACULAR. It digs for Seance, it dumps dudes in the yard to work with Seance, it searches out that last land you need, and it flashes back to do it a few turns later. Awesome card. if I were going to cut colors from this last, I'd run Alchemy as as 3x easily.

Disciple is, oddly enough, the worst card in the deck. I see why it's good, I've been a huge proponent of it, and it DID win me games due to 5 life gain and 5 cards...but I just hate playing it. =/ The 4 drop spot in my list is already full of stuff, and Disciple sucks on an empty board. I may cut it down to 1, if not completely. Disciple is best when you have Restoration Angels, as I would almost always swing for 3 in the air, drop Disciple, draw 3 and go on to win. But I almost never wanted to hit my bigger tokens like Wurms, because they're good as they are - I don't need 5 cards most of the time when my 5/5 trampler can kill you in two turns. 

Verdict saved my tail plenty of times, and replaying our threats is obviously not as big a deal to us. My teammates run Vorapede, both as a Disciple sac target and a way to still have a dude on the board post-wrath; and while I agree with that, I just didn't have the two Vorapedes (I actually have one, but didn't want to run it as a 1x). Running Vorapede also seems to turn the deck into pure aggro, and you just race/outgun your opponent into submission. My list plays more control like - I'll often hold an Armada Wurm in my hand until I know I can drop it and let it do it's work. A lot of my life total sheets from States just have ""20, 10, 0"" for my opponent's life.  Seems like a good way to win...

Also, I feel I have to comment on Mana Bloom. I don't think people realize how awesome that card is. It's another 2 drop ramp spell, and in my list (with so many 4 drops) that was absolutely critical. I see other lists running the Lantern, and while I think Lantern is a good card, I didn't like it in this list at all. Also, there's a hidden benefit to Bloom: people just let it sit there. It's so quiet and unassuming, no big deal, it's only one mana at a time, right? But it hands down lets me win games, because it's whatever mana I need to be right then (unlike Farseek), and it's not as ""oh man, now he has EVERY COLOR from EVERY LAND"" like the Lantern is. I dunno, for some reason the Lantern is a huge target, while Bloom got destroyed once the whole tournament, and it was when my opponent was mana screwed on two land and felt he had to do SOMETHING, so he Decay'd the Bloom to keep me off six mana. 

If you've yet to try Bloom in your lists, I suggest you try it. I think it's best with Liliana or something like Amass the Components; something where you can use it early, then when it returns to your hand in the later turns, you can just pitch it as a useless card. But even without being able to do that, Mana Bloom was spectacular. There were lots of games were I lay a Bloom for 1 on turn 1, ramp to an EOT angel on turn 3, then replay bloom for 2 on turn 4 to hit the turn 5 Armada Wurm. Yes, technically I lose my turn 2 and turn 4 plays, but I've also hit an Armada Wurm (or Severed a dude I need to kill!), and still hit Armada Wurm a turn early, which is often too much for the midrange decks to deal with because they can't sever, Mortar, or Dreadbore both creatures. Seriously helped.

Anyway, there it is. I had a lot of fun, went 6-2 for the whole event, and came away with some sweet prize support. Five color is totally possible, and it's good. :) Oh, also, if you're interested in a full tournament report, I also posted my decklist into the relevant forums on MTGSalvation.

1374604545.0,21,self.spikes,1iwfdn,[Standard] 26th at SCG Open: Richmond,22,1,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/1iwfdn/standard_26th_at_scg_open_richmond/,"To start, I know that 26th isn't the best place, but I still had a solid 7-2 record and everyone from 10th to 32nd did too. 


I was a big fan of B/R zombies back in the day with 4 falkenrath and 4 tundermaw. Cedric Phillips has been championing a deck recently that had 4 of both, so I was interested. The deck had burning tree and gyre sage as well. However, the problem I had with it was how it didn’t do things as well as other decks.  R/G was a better burning tree deck, and Naya was a better high curve aggressive deck. After reading Kibler’s article, (http://www.starcitygames.com/article/26461_Taking-My-Dragons-To-South-Beach.html ) I took some of his notes. I dropped the burning tree’s and gyre sage’s for stragleroot’s and putrefry, among other things, while also settling on a split 3-3 spilt of my 4 drops, rampager and huntmaster. I’m sure the list could be improved, but that’s not my strong spot. My final list can be seen here. http://admin.starcitygames.com//deckdatabase/displaydeck.php?DeckID=57566

Round 1: vs. Mitch (GW Ramp) His turn 1 play was elvish mystic, followed by elvish archdruid. He then played turn 3 primeval bounty. He then played lots of mana dorks and got a lot of beasts. He sided out the Primeval Bounties seeing how fast my deck was. Because he was G/W, he didn’t have much way to deal with my fliers,  so in games 2 and 3 Falkenrath and Thundermaw got him. Win 2-1

Round 2: vs. Jason (Jund) He was playing a pretty stock Jund list, however my draws were pretty mediocre against him. I got 4 elvish mystics, but was able to get him to 7, but kessig wolf run is pretty good at beating 1/1's for 1. Game 2 I just kind of flooded out, and after he dealt with my only form of pressure, he quickly won. Loss 2-0

Round 3: vs. (Junk Aristocrats) Now this is a match I like to play against. His tokens are just vastly inferior to my stronger creatures. Even cartel aristocrat is a minor annoyance when I have something like Flinthoof Boar. I just have to make sure to use removal on the key threats, blood artist and skirsdag high priest mainly.  Game 1 I just played double thundermaw helkite and he wasn’t able to stop it. Game 2 was where I made a huge mistake, where I hard casted a bonfire for 2 when I really shouldn’t have. It probably would not have mattered in the long run as my opponent had triple garruk relentless, but it still gets me now. I mull to 6 and as my opponent cuts he jokes about how he’s giving me a really good one. I told him it was going to be good, and I was going to have a turn 2 domri rade like last game. I play an elvish mystic, and as I draw my first card for the turn, it’s a domi rade. My opponent groans and I plus 1 him and reveal thundermaw helkite just for my opponent to groan again. I suspect he’s holding a lingering souls just I don’t get him when I cast the thundermaw. So I just attack with ground creatures  until I get him low enough to where the thundermaw will just get him anyways. Win 2-1

Round 4: vs. Alan (Naya Aggro) The thingI love about these GWx decks is they have barely any way to deal with my fliers aside from a flier of their own or selesyna charm. He plays experiment one and thalia, and my flinthoof boar just stays back on defense. I play falkenrath and he has no way to deal with it. Game 2 my opponent plays voice then strganleroot geist and then another voice. I  start chumping and play to my only out, a miracle bonfire. I didn’t get there. Game 3 I have double pillar of flame for his early threats. A timely borderland ranger gets me my 4th land I need for aristocrat, and once again he has no way to get there. Win 2-1

Round 5: vs. Voss (Esper Control) He’s playing esper control, and I’m playing falkenrath aristocrat. GG NO RE .My opponent was a cool guy. He was playing warped physique which he would use on my turn 1 dork both games. I’m not saying it was the wrong play, as getting rid of it is important, but it left him very vulnerable to aristocrat.  Win 2-0

Round 6: vs. Ali Antrazi (Esper Control) Ali is super nice, but I see him take out his cards from his deckbox  with them facing me, so I can see him on Esper control. I always try to keep an eye for things like this. It might not matter so much in standard, but for example, I was playing in a legacy open one time, and my opponent shuffled his deck in a way I was able to see some of his cards. From this I saw that he was on show and tell. This was for game 1 and my hand was one I would mulligan. But this hand was actually the nuts against show and tell, so I snap kept , and proceeded to win that game(and the match) Regardless, in game 1, he shows me a sphinx’s revelation from an augur of bolas. So I play huntmaster against him. He taps out on his turn prevent the flip. My board at that time was huntmaster, 2 strangleroot geists and an aristorcrat. I play borderland ranger, get a land, play another aristocrat, sac my borderland ranger for a +1/+1 and sac my 2 geists for their undying as well, and get him for 17 exactly. Game 2 his life total goes from 18 to 14 to 10 to 6 to 2. Can anyone guess what this was. I’ll give you a hint; it starts with “F” and ends in “alkenrath aristocrat.” It was actually pretty close because when he as at 2, he think twiced into a miracle, on my turn. Domri helped me refill my hand. And he just wasn’t able to stop every haste creature. Win 2-0

Round 7: vs. Joe (Jund) His hand has a bunch of removal, as Jund typically does. I get him to 3, feeling pretty good as I can get rid of 2 Olivia’s. But he as a third one, and it sticks, and I’m sure everyone can see what happened from there. Pretty straightforward game 2, he mulls to five, I play fliers and win.  Game 3 ends the game with him at 36 life. Double thragtusk and double huntmaster is pretty strong. Loss 0-2

Round 8: vs. Tyler(Esper Control) I’m a bit disheartened at this point as my chances of top 8 are gone with my second loss, but my spirits rise as I see my opponent is playing esper control.  Now I typically like to write a few notes about each of my games.  The only thing I wrote about this game was, “lol domri.”  I drew all three domri’s that game, and had an emblem in play with another domri in play. He has a lot of answers though and it took us a good 20 minutes to finish the game. This was a super tight game, and I get him to 2. He revs for 8 though, and at this point I concede for time’s sake. With about 10-15 minutes left in the round, we agree to a board state concession. We both want to make top 32, so a draw might as well be a loss. Essentially if it looks like he is going  to win but can’t because of time, I concede, and if the opposite situation occurs he’ll concede to me. I play turn 1 mystic, turn 2 haste boar, turn 3 falkenrath, turn 4 ghor-clan bloodrush.  He’s about to miss his 4th land drop and concedes.  Win2-1

Round 9: vs. Jarvis Yu(Jund) Jarvis seemed kind of upset when I sat down, and seemed pretty annoyed when I beat his 9 with an 11 for me to go first. However we are only on turn 2 when a judge comes over and tells us she needs to stop the game. She pulls Jarvis from the table and eventually looks through his deck. She pulls out a card and is given a game loss. Apparently he played a friend the previous round who was using the same sleeves as him and accidentally shuffled it into his deck. Game 2 he got stuck on 3 lands but it only stopped him from being able to play 2 huntmasters, which wouldn’t do much with my double falkenrath and double strangleroot geist. Win 2-0

I end up in 26th, and as I wait in line to collect my 100$ I have a quick chat with the guy behind me and Shaheen Soorani.  We talk about the surprising amount of esper control, and the strength of Jund.  I’m quite pleased with my results in the end.

Placed 11 at SCG Legacy Open in Columbus on 6/17/13 – Playing Omni-Show
Decklist: http://deckbox.org/sets/399922


This was the first big event I had gone to since a sealed event that I went to when conflux was released. I had always wanted to play a show and tell list, and had been slowly getting the cards together for it, and when I saw the decklist that ran cunning wishes, I was set in the style of show and tell that I wanted to play.

On to the matches:

**Match 1: CounterTop with Mark**

I won the die roll, keeping a T3 kill with a brainstorm in hand, playing an island and passing.  Mark drew then played a plains and passed.  With an end of turn brainstorm I was able to draw a City of Traitors, which allowed me to go off on my second turn.  Unsure of what he was playing except for a plains, I did not side in the leylines to counter any discard he might have had.

Game 2 I kept a hand with 2 digging spells and a show and tells, a force, and a cunning wish which seemed like a very good hand. He turn one island and top and passed, I let that resolve thinking it would not slow me down too much, as he would only get about 1-2 uses of it as long as I did not whiff with the digging spells. I preordained and found 1 piece of the combo and passed.  He played a second top and a plains and passed.  I dug again on my turn and found the whole combo while having another cantrip to use with force.  He topped end of turn, played a plains and passed. I untapped, drew a city of traitors which would have let me pay for daze if that is what he was holding and played Show and Tell.  After forcing his spell pierce, Show and Tell resolved leaving him with a Detention Sphere targeting Omniscience.  With trigger on the stack, Cunning Wish into Firemind’s into Cunning Wish and Flusterstorm into trickbind let me secure the win.

1-0	in matches, 2-0 in games

**Match 2: American with Bryan Hockey**

Losing the die roll, I was digging until about turn 4, taking double Lightning Bolt and Grim Lavamancer damage.  Show and Tell on Turn 4 with no backup and him brainstorming in response but whiffing, I was able to take game 1. Shuffle up and onto the next game.

Had a turn 2 kill in opening hand with Pact of Negation, Thinking this was enough I was met with a RED then a Flusterstorm to have me kill myself next upkeep since I could not pay for the pact.
	Game 3 was one of the closest matches that I had during the whole tournament, with me not comboing till turn 6.  The first 4 turns of so were cantrips on both sides, with him flashing in a snapcaster mage to start the clock against me.  On my turn 6, I tried for a show and tell for dreamhalls with enter the infinite in hand along with 2 Force of Wills, a Brainstorm, and a Pact of Negation.  He starts the counter war with his own force, which I meet with a pact, which after resolution is met with a RED on the Show and Tell, which I try to counter with a Force paying a brainstorm, which is then forced again, which leads me to have to pay all 5 lands I have on my upkeep and him flashing in a Restoration angel to take the game.

1-1 in matches, 3-2 in games

**Match 3: American Delver with Donavan** 

Was able to play though his double daze and force and a turn 1 delver that flipped with having City of Traitors as my third land and a Force plus Pact to secure game 1.

Game 2 was another counter war that started with Show and Tell getting Dazed, which I had to use Pact on, then Pact again on an Izzet Charm, then finally Forcing his Pyroblast.

2-1 in matches, 5-2 in games

**Match 4: Elves with Justing Hertel**
 
I have never played against an elves deck before, especially not one that was almost completely foiled out except for some of the Gaia’s Cradles. Game 1 I was very lucky to win, especially since I lost the die roll, with him fizzling off his turn 3 Glimpse of Nature, I was able to win on my turn 3 as elves cannot really answer a show and tell.  

Game 2 I lost as he did not fail to combo off on turn 3, and I had no force in order to answer his glimpse.

Game 3 I was able to Show and Tell on turn 3 to win, with him Showing a Regal Force and drawing 3 cards, but not actually able to do anything with  them. After the games, Justin said that he decided not to side in anything vs me, since it would only slow him down and he thought just being able to pretty consistently combo off on t3 would be better than drawing a discard spell.

3-1 in matches, 7-3 in games

**Match 5: Sneak and Show with Stephen Rakovich**

Very nice guy, me losing the die roll, we both just pondered turn 1 and 2 and he played Show and Tell dropping an Emrakul on turn 3, for which I showed a Dream Halls.  Passing the turn, I was able to brainstorm and draw and Enter the Infinite to seal the game, even with facing down an Emrakul.

Game 2 he said after the match he sided would some of his Show and Tells for Misdirections.  With him going first , I had assumed he had meant to show and tell on his turn 3, and since I had an Ancient Tomb in hand, along with an Intuition as well as a cunning wish, I felt I was safe to let him, as I could wish for something to put in, or wish for a Force of Will for more protection or Intuition for Omniscience should the need arise.  He plays 2 lotus petals on his third turn followed by a sneak attack with 1 mana open and 3 cards in hand, not wanting to lose to an Emrakul, I decide it would be best to Force the Sneak Attack.  He then Spell Pierces my force, but with me having 3 mana open, I decide to pay for it rather than leave mana open in order to win on my turn.  He then tanks for a while and calls a judge while spell pierce is still on the stack.  After talking with the judge for a few minutes the force resolves and I go on to win on my turn 3 with a luckily drawn enter the infinite. The question that he was asking was that if he was allowed to move my Force of Will with one of the 2 Misdirections that were in his hand to his spell pierce after I paid for it.  He did not ask the right question, since he could have used the Misdirection to force my Force to target the Misdirection and have it be countered due to lack of legal target when it resolved.  

4-1 in matches, 9-3 in games

**Match 6: ANT with Scott Ruggirero**

I had played against Scott the night before in a side event and got crushed the last time, so I had a very bad feeling about how well I would do this game. In the first match I had a Turn 2 kill, which on his turn 1 was answered by using Duress to get rid of Omniscience.  A lucky top of brainstorm into another Omniscience let me steal the game on my Turn 3.

This was the first match that I felt I needed to side in the 3 Leyline of Sanctity in order to both counter his tendrils and his discard. The first time I did this the night before, I had to mull to 5 in order to get a leyline on T0, but this time it was in my opening hand, and with him unable to draw a chain of vapor, I was able to win off of 3 cunning wishes in a row in order to combo off with force backup. 

5-1 in matches. 11-3 in games

**Match 7: BUG with Justin Geary**

Losing the die roll and getting hit with 2 discard spells plus a spellpierce when I tried to show and tell to not die lost game 1 for me.
Game 2 even with siding in the 3 leylines, I had to mull to 5 because I had no lands in the first hand, one land in the second with 4 enter the infinites. I decided to keep the no lands but 4 cantrips and a force hand since mulling to 4 would not get me there but maybe drawing a land might.  It did not and I got stomped really hard and was not able to get to a point where I could show and tell to victory, even if he had no counters in his hand.

5-2 in matches, 11-5 in games

**Match 8: Shardless BUG with Brad Hammond**

With me winning the die roll and him mulling to 5, I was able to combo off on turn 2 with no problems.
Game 2 went about the same, except he answered Show and Tell with a force, which I Pact.

6-2 in matches, 13-5 in games

**Match 9 : Feature Match with _______________**

I do not know what he was playing unfortunately, as he had to mull to 5 then die to a T3 Show and Tell with his T1 of Thoughtseize being Forced, with me not playing a land on my turn 1. The reason I did this was because I had no idea what he was playing, and did not want to lose the match due to him wastelanding my Ancient Tomb that I had as my only land and then needing to get 3 lands instead of just draw the 1 I needed to in order to go off on T3.

I saw that he was playing Black or Green, as he had a catacombs as his land, so I decided to side in the Leylines, of which I got 1 in my opening hand in game 2. He had no answer to it, and it was a T3 Show and Tell in order to win the game.

**Final Record: 7-2, 13-5 in games**

I was happy with how the deck preformed, and if I had played better during game 2 of Match 2 and got luckier with the hands I got during the Match 7 game 2, I may have been able to make top 8.  The deck overall seems incredibly strong, it may even be ban worthy, and since the sideboard is mainly wish, there are really only 3 cards that need to come in, which any game they came in took the place of the Pact of Negations in the main board.

As far as the sideboard goes:
* I never faced dredge, so Noxious Revival and Surgical Extraction were never wished for. I think keeping the Noxious Revival in the sideboard is very important, because it means you will not lose to Sudden Shock or Wipe Away or Sudden Spoiling when you do draw to win off of Laboratory Maniac.  But if you are not going to face a graveyard deck, then Surgical can probably be replaced.
* I never had to play against death and taxes, or maverick, so slaughter pact never needed to come in to kill a Thalia or a Gaddok Teeg, so depending on the Meta this card is not necessary.
* I did not face belcher or a deck that ran Chalice of the Void, so Echoing Truth/Wipe Away never had to come in to deal with those decks, but the space of those 2 cards is certainly needed for the times where one does face that match.
* Force/Pact should stay, as they can help you get ready for your combo vs a very heavy counterspell deck
* Firemind’s foresight seems like a card that does not really need a slot, as it was almost always a win more card.  Since you are cunning wishing for it, if you have omniscience out, it almost always becomes another Cunning wish or Intuition + Flusterstorm + Impulse. If you have Dream Halls out, it works in your favor by netting you 1 card, as long as Impulse is still in the deck verses going Cunning Wish straight for Intuition.
* Intuition needs to stay in the sideboard so that you can find an enter the infinite off of an Omniscience resolving.
* Trickbind needs to stay in because it stops almost every deck’s answer to Show and Tell resolving and cannot be responded to.

Since I did not know the field I had the sideboard as it was, but after the fact, I would have most likely changed the sideboard to: 

1 Noxious Revival

1 Slaughter Pact

1 Research // Development

1 Wipe Away

1 Trickbind

1 Firemind’s Foresight

1 Intuition

1 Force of Will

1 Laboratory Maniac

4 Leyline of Sanctity – slightly more discard hate

2 Defense Grid – deal with the multitude of counters I had to deal with all day

**Round 1 - Death Blade**

Game 1 was very grindy and I ended up pulling it out at 1 life thanks to a Deathrite Shaman and a Jace. Game 2 started looking really bad really fast so I scooped to save some clock for game 3 which paid off when my Garruk killed him in turns.

1-0

**Round 2 - Aggro Loam**

Due to the nature of Loam decks we had a 35 minute grind fest game 1 that ended with my Garruk fighting a Countryside Crusher to clear the way for my factories. Game 2 was somewhat close but I got stuck on lands and died to a big knight. We started Game 3 with 2 minutes on the clock and shockingly drew the match.

1-0-1

**Round 3 - Aggro Loam**

In what is probably a first in open series history I hit my second aggro loam opponent in a row. Game 1 I won the die roll and landed a deathrite shaman before he could chalice on one. The shaman was able to widdle him away while I kept him on one land with a wasteland lock. Game 2 ended in a similar fashion. 

2-0-1

**Round 4 - U/W Miracles**

I thought game 1 was going to be over before it began as I mulled to 5 with a one lander. I was able to climb back in when I wasted my opponents 2nd land and spell pierced his Rest In Peace. We both looked at each other for a few turns and discarded before either of us found a 2nd land. Typically durdleing occurred until I blew him out with a deed killing a detentionshipere on my lilly, a detentionshpere on my jace, a counter balance, and an enginereed explosives on 1 you can use your imagination from there. Game 2 I ruined his hand with a raven's crime and liliana and killed him with factories.

3-0-1

**Round 5 - U/W/R Midrange**

Game 1 was sort of a blow out as I thoughtseized his Jace and deeded his board away with some man lands to clean up. Game 2 was quite the nail biter however. At one point I was at 4 life facing down a stoneforge, a restoration angel, and a factory but was able to clear the board with a dimir charm, a lilly edict, and a waste land. A few turns later he lands a V-Clique on the end step which is met with my brainstorm dredging my darkblast in combat. After I had successfully stabalized at 4 a shaman and a factory where able to beat him down while Jace filtered his draws. I ended up seeing my opponent at the top 8 meeting later so it worked out for him.

4-0-1

**Round 6 - Reanimator**

Game 1 was pretty quick as a turn 1 thought seize saw an Iona, a careful study, 2 reanimation spells, and some lands. After taking the careful study I resolved a Shaman on turn 2 and locked him out. Game 2 was lead with a thoughtseize into a goyf that was followed up with a clique and a force on his carefulstudy to take it down in 2 games.


5-0-1

**Round 7 - Zoo**

Game 1 was very long and very grindy. I made a mistake I won't be making again in auto pioliting when I think I have it locked up. I did not wasteland my opponents 2nd land and he ended up drawing the game with a price of progress while dead on board to my death rite shaman. Games 2 and 3 where not nearly as close however has I was able to stabilize fairly quickly with removal for his creatures and wastelands for his mostly non basic mana base.

6-0-1


**Round 8 - Camera match versus Death Blade**

I was a little bit worried when my opponent had a turn 2 stoneforge on the play but was able to grind it out with liliana and cabal pit killing him 25 minutes later with a pair of factories. Game 2 was a little more in my favor after a k grip on his batterskull early on. The feature match can be watched [here](http://blip.tv/scglive/scgcol-lgc-rd-8b-michael-kletz-vs-justin-geary-6605038)

7-0-1

**Round 9 - Intentional Draw**

After doing some tie breaker math with Hoogland I was for sure in with a draw and my opponent had similar feelings.

7-0-2

**Quarterfinals vs Todd Anderson**

The match can be found [here](http://www.twitch.tv/m/25901). Game 1 was an absolute grind fest. At one point todd had double my lands with a jace and creature advantage but I was able to grind him out and take over the game with a cabal pit. Game 2 was very close and the weight of the day and being sick was setting in. I let Todd untap with a karakas when I had a deed for his geist and lost rather quickly after that. Between games 2 and 3 Todd requested we take a short break and get me some water because I looked like death and felt like passing out. Game 3 Todd had the very strong opener his deck needs to beat mine and I wasn't able to recover. Lesson learned always drink water during these things especially when your sick...

**In conclusion**

The deck felt extremely powerful all day and I'm for sure playing it at the invitational in Somerset next month. The cards I'm looking at changing are the spell snare from the main deck also the Raven's Crime and Notion Thief from the sideboard. I have a few different ideas in mind for the changes like an exploration but thats still to be figured out. I enjoyed writing this so I hope you enjoyed reading it!

I have created these decks from those pools:

The idea of this thread is to get us talking about Sealed strategies for GP Vegas or to just be a better Limited player. So lets discuss the two pools and talk about what would be best to build from them.

Below is my reasoning for the two decks I created:

Deck1:

I think the Green/White appear to be strong (white having the single good removal spell), also I didn't really see any strong archetype (at least in my opinion strong enough to abandon the G/W beat down). 

Deck 2:

When I was going through this I immediately noticed the numerous amount of combos for Jiki and decided to try and build around that, the deck I put together from this sealed pool has many come into battlefield triggers that can be abused with Jiki. http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/mm-sealed-pool2-deck/

I also splashed green for alternate win conditions with Cloak and Tromp. But the more I look at this pool the more I wonder if abandoning Jiki all together is a better idea and to focus on G/W/? to use the kitchen flinks and white control cards, but if I do that I lose the shackles, lots of choices in this one.",,False,,t5_2utkz,False,,,True,t3_1gaz29,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/1gaz29/i_have_a_box_of_mm_and_opened_the_first_and/,

And I have come across a lot of people saying that there is no place for control in this meta. That decks are either too fast or too resilient to be controlled. 

However, DGM is giving two new counterspells a few new removal cards (here's looking at you Far//Away) and a great new win condition(Aetherling). 

So I am wondering what all of you think. Is there room for a solid control build in this meta? Which colors are best suited for the job? What cards should be seriously considered? And what are the biggest threats to control and how can they be answered?

I don't have time to post my Four color list right now, but if anyone wants to see it let me know and I'll go ahead and do so. 
 
EDIT: This is a link to my four color brew: http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/four-color-control-24-04-13-1/

The 3x unsummon are actually Far//Away, which Tapped out won't let me save in the deck.

For a bit of an explanation: This deck relies on controlling the board, via removal and counterspells and wins with either Aetherling, or by drawing out the game/ nephalia drownyard. 

Sideboard is crafted for a few key problems with the deck. 
I used to run Ground Seal in my sideboard for an answer to reanimator decks, but I found that taking away my snapcaster mages was too rough on the deck. So I added cremate, which is frankly perfect. Removes the target card and then draws me a card.

Devor Flesh is more removal for aggro. Fog also goes in against aggro, sometimes you need that extra turn to get online. It does a good job vs. the explosive second turn many gruul/naya decks have.

Dissipate and Negate come in for the control and reanimator match ups.  Though Negate might leave for Syncopate. 

Psychic Spiral and Notion Thief come in vs. the control match up, especially the esper match up. 

Lastly, Ray of Revelation helps deal with the Assemble the Legion decks, which now also have Legion's Initiative.

But, look at the two most recent tournaments (WMCQ and SCG open, both 4/20) - it's nowhere to be seen. At my local FNM, there's always been a couple of people running it who seem to do decent enough. Does anyone have any idea about the archetype right now? Here are mine:

- Memory adept is obviously quite good. We have [this deck](http://sales.starcitygames.com//deckdatabase/displaydeck.php?DeckID=54805) that runs 3, and [this one](http://sales.starcitygames.com//deckdatabase/displaydeck.php?DeckID=54801) that runs 1. After watching some of the streams of Hetrick playing, Jace seems to be quite good, and is often a solid finisher for him.

- One of Obzedat main. I'm not a fan of this - it never seems to be that incredibly helpful. To be fair, he is quite difficult to deal with and his ETB effect slowly drains. I still feel like it's not worth it though.

- Forbidden alchemy is a great card, but is it worth running over a Sphinx's Revelation, or anything else for that matter? It can help with finding that turn 4 Verdict, but there's already so much draw in the deck it doesn't seem necessary.

- Ghost Quarter seems solid. I've talked to a couple people running it and they've said it's fantastic for Caverns and Kessig - both of which wreck Esper. People I've talked to run one main, and an additional side. Seems like it's worth it. Although the additional colorless is something to consider, and I don't feel like it's worth it to remove a Nephalia for the one main.

- ""Superfriends"" Esper control (Like [this](http://sales.starcitygames.com//deckdatabase/displaydeck.php?DeckID=54796)). I've always been a fan of Superfriends, but I'm not too sure about how powerful it will be against the current meta, especially when the other Esper control archetypes are present. It just feels weaker and more finicky to me.

So those are my thoughts, what does everyone else think? 

I've been tempted to give this archetype a shot for a while now, I think I may.


Edit: Alright so the things we've touched on:

- Singleton Obzedat main can be pretty good.

- Terminus could be good against Aggro, but siding Planar Cleansing is still necessary

- Superfriends is generally far too finicky and sensitive

- Enchantment based control could be good, EG Detention Sphere, Curse of Death's Hold. Curse of Echoes perhaps?",,False,,t5_2utkz,1366649506.0,,,True,t3_1ctsnx,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/1ctsnx/standard_viability_of_esper_control_and_new_ideas/,

I play the Flash Version at the moment but I am leaning towards going Midrange.

These are my lists, I have the basic flash build and a Midrange oriented deck that I have been pondering.

http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/uwr-flash-16-03-13-1/ - Flash

http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/uwr-midrange-18-03-13-1/ - Midrange


**Midrange or Flash**

On one hand you have the Flash deck that has been popular and has done fairly well in tournaments.[This list took 8th at GP Verona](http://www.mtgtop8.com/event?e=4503&amp;d=226130) it's the more traditonal Flash list other than the 2 main board Assemble the Legion. It uses the Boros Reckoner and Harvest Pyre combo and the rest of the list is what we've been seeing as of late from UWr.

Then there is the Midrange deck that runs Thundermaws, Geist of Saint Traft and even Aurelia. [This list took 7th at GP Verona](http://www.mtgtop8.com/event?e=4503&amp;d=226129) it's not running Boros Reckoner and Augur of Bolas. But instead it is running Thundermaw, Geist and More Snapcaster/Restoration angel.

So which would you play and why is one the better choice?

**Mainboard**

I've been feeling Boros Reckoner to be Very lackluster in my deck and have been debating running Geist over him and this is what brought me to the Idea of running a Midrange deck instead of the flash. 

With access to Thundermaw Hellkite maindeck we lose our weakness to Lingering souls which is a problem with all the Junk decks starting to pop up that use this card as a 2-3 of. 

Some list I've seen run Aurelia and I find this to be interesting also the deck seemed to be more midrange focused instead of flash. [Here is the list](http://www.mtgtop8.com/event?e=4551&amp;d=226391).


**Sideboard**

The sideboard is something to talk about also, Jace, Memory Adept has all but vanished from the sideboards of this deck now we are seeing Assemble the Legion. What else could fit into the sideboard of this deck? The flash version used to use Geist as a 4 of and now there hasn't been a lot of him showing up in there either.

I think Geist is a must in the flash list if you want to play more aggressively you can swap him with Reckoner.

Supreme Verdict Sideboard is better than having it mainboard in my opinion in the flash version. With Boros Reckoner as such a defensive card that they can't attack into you can have enough time to stabilize and take over the game. 

Assemble has been very promising. It puts Control in a difficult spot since they can't deal with it very well and in other match ups they are really good chump blockers and put you ahead if the game continues to drag on. 


With Junk rites using Obzedat now and the rise of Assemble decks we need a way to deal with then and I think Urgent Exorcism is that card it's instant speed so it can deal with Obze and Assemble as soon as they come out if they are really an issue.


**Why isn't this deck a good choice? What Else should I play?**

Other than Junk Rites deck what are our bad match ups? How do we deal with these kinds of decks and what can we change in the deck and board to have a better chance at these decks?

Are there better decks to be playing in the current meta?

With the addition of Boros Reckoner and Cavern of Souls midrange decks being pushed into smaller margins I feel like the deck is in a really good spot at the moment. I talked about it some in my article this week (http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/silvestri-says-pt-gatecrash-postmortem/), but I wanted to gather some general opinions about the difference between Joel Larsson and GT's builds.

For example, countermagic makes little sense outside of Izzet Charm if you want the most aggressive of builds. Most of the time a burn spell will accomplish the same goal and with the emphasis on Geist or Boros Reckoner even pump like Moment of Heroism has a greater impact than a random Counterflux. The ability to side into countermagic remains relevant though.

Is a more aggressive take the right way to go though? It forces action from midrange and frankly more ways to keep your Reckoners alive with the Indestructible mode on Boros Charm is a great boon for aggressive matches as well. It also allows you to stay on defense for most of the game and kill them from nearly half life with end step Boros Charm, untap, Snapcaster Boros Charm. 

Notably out of the current decks UWR Flash matches up best against the various Saito decks RG and Naya Aggro strategies and even Jund Aggro has issues against either build or UWR.

So going forward do you feel there will be enough of a bounce back toward controlling strategies that countermagic becomes a relevant boon and the same with the Jace plan or should we stick to Larsson's aggressive burn plan?",,False,,t5_2utkz,False,,,True,t3_18vmwr,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/18vmwr/standard_opinions_on_the_best_shell_of_uwr_flash/,

This is a pretty crucial point in Papa Jace's potential future, if the meta can't handle him now, it may be a long, long time before it can.

Recently I've noticed I've become torn between two cards to run; those cards being Stony Silence and Suppression Field. My meta consists of UWR control, UWR Isochron/Gifts control, Melira Pod, Tron, B/W Tokens, RDWs, and Affinity/Tempered Steel. This is merely so that those reading will have some frame of reference as to my points on each card.

I was wondering which one is better in the sideboard.

&gt;[Stony Silence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=247425)

Good against Tron and pod, and sometimes it comes in against Affinity. I'm not sure as to the lengths this card can affect the meta, which is why I've recently questioned it. Its amazing against tron. Turning all of their Ostones into duds is great, and since [Oblivion Stone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=247338) is the only thing mainboard they run that can get rid of walkers and non-creatures. It also prevents them from using their mana eggs ([Chromatic Star](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=135279) and its friends). 

Against Birthing Pod it does work, turning their pods into duds as well. Problem with Pod is that both Kiki and Melira pod tend to run maindeck enchantment or artifact hate of some form, mostly from [Harmonic Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=109706) and [Qasali Pridemage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=249405).

&gt;[Suppression Field](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=83617)

A surprisingly undervalued and forgotten card. I know its not quite as effective as Stony Silence in hosing artifacts, but I feel like Suppression Field is great against planeswalkers, control variants that run Snapcaster mages, as well as Kikipod and Splinter Twin combos. It also shuts down some variants of RDWs and hatebears, and can also help against Affinity in some match-ups.

Basically, I just wanted a few more opinions on which one seems like the better of the two. I don't think running both is the solution because running both seems like overkill and is going to hurt other match ups.

I keep trying to find a deck that can hold it's own against GR aggro while keeping at least some of the power level the flash deck had against other decks, but coming up blank. It seems like any 3 color strategies are just prime targets for burning earth. I'm mostly thinking about 2 lists.

First: http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/uw-control-13-08-13-2/

It's a variation of this 7th place deck from SCG Salt Lake City: http://sales.starcitygames.com//deckdatabase/displaydeck.php?DeckID=58356

I think this deck has potentila since it's pretty much immune to burning earth and has enough cards to pressure Domri. I think blind obedience is an amazing card right now. Anyone think cutting the augur/resto package for a couple snaps mainboard + celestial flare and ratchet bomb is better? I think the latter version is much more vulnerable to domri rade sadly.

This is the second list: http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/uwr-geist-13-08-13-1/

It's in the early stages, but I'm thinking something aggressive with geist is the way to go. I really like Boros Reckoner right now. It pressures Domri really well and can stonewall the GR decks on the ground. Maybe we can have a flash deck with reckoner again, I'm not sure. The list can probably do with less burn and more counterspells.

Anyone else brewing with blue? I've pretty much given up on the Matt Costas UWR Flash or UWR Control as they seem pretty painful against GR.",,False,,t5_2utkz,False,,,True,t3_1kaliu,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/1kaliu/standard_is_blue_just_bad_in_the_current_metagame/,

* [Second One](http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/events.aspx?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/theros13ptq/0728tampa)

Any general thoughts on this deck? It is a ""good stuff"" deck in the same vein of Jund, but it gets to play a decently different card selection. 

Warleader's Helix is a crazy powerful card. Both versions played four copies of it. 

Slaughter Games/Underworld Connections means you get to keep up with the Rev Decks.

Jamming 4x Oblivion Ring into the board seems like a fine solution to beating Burning Earth.

I'm still kicking around what exactly I like for the deck list, but I think [this](http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/bwr-control-09-08-13-1/) is going to be my starting point for testing. I don't have a standard event myself until the end of the month (SCG Cinci) so a lot can change between now and then, but I still felt the arch type might be worth talking about.

After getting crushed by Sire Jund last night with my Wolf Run Bant deck, I'm looking into other possible decks for the new meta. My thinking is, token decks could be good right now, as Sire punishes all of the decks that run Wrath effects, which mean Wrath effects will probably be at a low for the near future. Spamming tokens into play makes their Sires pretty bad, and also gives you a leg-up in the aggro matchups, where hopefully you can then go over the top with Intangible Virtue or Collective Blessing.

I'm jumping between Junk, Bant, and Esper. I've done some 'testing' on cockatrice and I really can't tell which is the best combination for a token deck. Each deck actually plays pretty differently, so mashing them together into a 4-color monstrosity doesn't seem like a great idea. My thoughts on each of the decks:

**Junk**

* Ready//Willing is insane, and one of the main reasons to run this version

* Advent of the Wurm is a great new addition

* Lacks ways to generate card advantage other than 2-for-1 token makers and PWs

**Bant**

* Loses Lingering Souls and Sorin, but adds the Snapcaster/Call of the Conclave interaction

* Snapcaster is awesome (had to put this twice, he really drives this deck) -- Advent o' Wurm, Call o' Conclave, Midnight Haunting... good stuff.

* Sphinx's Rev. is playable

**Esper**

* Lingering Souls, Midnight Haunting, Talrand's Invocation, and potentially Call of the Nightwing means lots of evasive creatures, but smaller than those of the other decks

* Talrand proper could have a slot

* Snapcaster can be a big player, but not as huge as in Bant

* Tokens all have flying, so Favorable Winds can be Intangible Virtues 5 and 6 (or more if needed)

* Access to far//away and sphinx's rev for card advantage

* Probably the most controlling, but also the worst to Sire if he stays a boogeyman of the format

Just a few of my thoughts so far. I don't have fleshed-out decklists quite yet, I'm trying a lot of different options. Just wanted to get some input so maybe I can focus my playtesting on whatever the consensus is for the 'best deck.'

My current testing makes me think it will be a relevant role-player in certain decks, especially those who want to be flexible, or are comfortable playing the reactionary role.  I will talk about this card in respect to decks that can reasonably cast it (Bant, RUG, BUG, maybe Blue Naya or Blue Reanimator) and the archetypes you will end up facing.


Vs. Aggro decks: Not terribly good, as some decks (like Naya Blitz) it's just too slow to do anything with before they kill you.  But if you can somehow stabilize with a Thragtusk, Centaur Healer, Loxodon Smiter or Restoration Angel and cast this card, cloning one of the 4 dudes I just named, it should put the game out of reach for those decks.  For something like a Bant Hexproof deck it is probably too slow still, but if they stumble or go all-in on a GoST and you can survive to cast this, you should win.


vs. Control decks: Again, not at it's best here, as you will probably end up cloning your own creature (ideally a Thragtusk) so if they wrath the board you end up with two 3/3s instead of one.  It'll be rough trying to beat them, but again, if you can get it to start pooping out tokens of itself, it should put the game out of reach, no matter how many wraths and bounce effects they have.


vs. Midrange (and Reanimator) decks: this is where the Mimic truly shines.  They play a Thragtusk, you clone it and watch them multiply.  Thundermaw Hellkite? Clone it and watch Dragons rain fire down upon your opponent.  Restoration Angel?  Say hello to blink center.  Acidic Slime?  You get to Strip Mine them to death. Angel of Serenity?  Mine's cheaper, and I get one every turn now, thank you very much.  Craterhoof Behemoth? Assuming you survive the hoofing, you can Hoof right back.  Even cloning something cheap like a Fiend Hunter, Boros Reckoner, or Falkenrath Aristocrat means you have probably just stabilized the board and threaten to over-take them if you untap with it still alive.


""The Flex Role"" : depending upon how you build your deck, this card can be Angel of Serenity #5-8, Thragtusk #5-8, Restoration Angel #5-8, Acidic Slime #3-6, and any other cards I can't think of.  The extra mana cost should be viewed here not as a hinderance, but a down payment of what it's ability does.  It forces your opponent to answer it right away, or the game will quickly fall out of their reach.

**tl;dr Version: It's better than people think it is, possibly worth a couple of maindeck slots, but a good SB card for the decks that can afford it.**",,False,,t5_2utkz,False,,,True,t3_1dh0zz,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/1dh0zz/standard_progenitor_mimic/,

Shadow Carpet (or ""Peddle to the Metal"" / RUG staticaster-peddler splashing black) is a deck that originated in Grand Prix Atlantic City and brought to the attention of the masses by Brad Nelson. Brad piloted [this list](http://mtgtop8.com/event?e=4185&amp;d=224451) to a 3rd place finish in the event. During my down time, after a terrible performance playing Esper Control, I saw brad at the top tables playing the deck. Instantly fell in love. While the deck has fallen out of favor, I've been trying to create a more competitive version for the current meta over the last two weeks; improving the control matchup. I'll give a basic overview of the deck I'm playing right now and discuss major card choices.

**Decklist and Reasoning**

You can usually find my most updated list that I'm playing on [TappedOut](http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/shadow-carpet/). My sideboard is constantly in flux, but the main stays relatively similar if you need a reference. On to the specifics:

**Creatures** (26):

4 Nightshade Peddler

The ""combo"" creature of the deck, having synergistic effects with a few of the other cards in the deck. It is also a good early blocker with deathtouch that can trade up with bigger creatures if needed. Usually making sure your Peddler isn't in harm's way is a major part of the deck playstyle, though. 

4 Izzet Staticaster

The main other half of the ""combo"". Izzet Staticaster by itself is a little better than Peddler however. Being able to pick off Junk's mana dorks and pick on their mana very important. A solid blocker for all the 2/2s in naya blitz, but can also pick off Boros Elite and Mayor of Avabruck. When Izzet Staticaster is soulbound with Peddler, you get a 1 damage deathtouch pinger that kills all of the creature with the same name; a potent force.

4 Thragtusk

Thragtusk is just a powerhouse in this deck. While Restoration Angel is not included in this list, it stills has a lot of versatility in Shadow Carpet. It provides the most ""board sweep protection"" in the sense that you can usually just commit Thragtusk to the board and win off of it. Pairing Nightshade Peddler with the Thragtusk token is a good way to get extra value out of your Thragtusk. The life gain is also very important in this deck as it is for other decks.

4 Huntmaster of the Fells

Similar to Thragtusk. While not having Restoration Angel is a bit of downside, Huntmaster gained a lot of value when I added 3 Yeva into the deck. The token can be paired with Peddler, just like Thragtusk. However, if you pair Huntmaster to Peddler, when Huntmaster flips into Ravager it can take a creature with its 2 damage to it. Good value overall. 

3 Yeva, Nature's Herald

I started with only a single copy of Yeva in Shadow Carpet, but it quickly proved time after time again why it should deserve more spots. Allows Nightshade Peddler to do a pretty good Ambush Viper impression, but more importantly you can cast Yeva at the end of turn 4 and then have a turn 5 Nightshade Peddler + Izzet Staticaster with *flash*. Prime Speaker Zegana at the end of turn to draw 5 is also a pretty common play that can really wreck midrange and control decks alike. Gives all of our green creatures ""pseudo haste"" and protection from sorceries for a turn.

3 Prime Speaker Zegana

Prime Speaker is the Sphinx's Revelation of Shadow Carpet. Easily drawing up to 5-6 cards with little effort. Keeps the hand full and stocked with combo pieces. Chaining Zeganas is usually very easy to do, because your opponent is usually dead if they don't kill the first one. Overall a very good draw engine.

2 Olivia Voldaren

Olivia is the card that tips the Junk matchup into our favor. Stealing their Angels of Serenity or Thragtusks is very good and it can become a become a bulky evasive beater. When paired with Nightshade Peddler, Olivia becomes a deathtouch machine gun that can tear through your opponent's creatures with ease.

2 Borderland Ranger

Not too much to say about Borderland Ranger, besides the fact that it's one of the main cards that makes this deck possible. It can trade with a creature against aggro, but helps to fix the deathly mana base that needs GGUURBB to use all of its cards as efficiently as possible.

**Non-Creatures** (10):

3 Domri Rade

Domri is a card I'm really not sure how I feel about yet. People keep telling me that it's bad, but I am always impressed with it. It draws a card about half the time and provides a good win condition against the control matchup where they really can't compete with double strike, haste, hexproof, and trample. Fighting with Nightshade Peddler is also very good.

4 Farseek

Farseek is really important in this deck. Getting a turn 3 Yeva, Olivia, or Huntmaster is very good and puts you ahead of the opponent on curve. It isn't a creature for Domri, but can take lands out of the deck to help it hit a little bit more. Also helps with the atrocious color fixing I mentioned earlier.

3 Grisly Salvage

I've been playing grisly salvage, but Brad played tracker's instinct. The main difference between the two is that Salvage is an instant and can grab lands (1 card deeper too), while tracker's has the option to be flashed back for more value. Still not sure which is better but I have been liking salvage personally to grab one of the utility lands.

**Important Lands**:

One of each basic

Only important for borderland ranger.

1 Kessig Wolf Run

Could probably go up to two and cut a salvage (increasing the land count slightly) because this card is so good. It turns our dead peddlers or staticasters into threats for every deck and functions well with the tokens that huntmaster and thragtusk leave behind. Also makes the extra farseeks and borderland rangers relevant in the late game.

1 Alchemist's Refuge

I've like this card in all of my testing because instant speed has so much versatility, but now with so many Yevas in the deck it gets slightly worse. It could be the swap for the Wolf Run instead of the salvage, but that judgment still requires more testing I think.

**Notable Cards I've Tried**:

Deathrite Shaman

I like deathrite shaman and I understand it has a lot of potential, but it doesn't really give this deck much more reach than it already has or ramps us. I still like it though, as a hate card against Junk (as you'll see in the sideboard).

Master Biomancer

A little too gimmicky for the deck and requires a huge commitment to the board to make it work effectively. Tested one copy that I ended up cutting.

Evil Twin

Like DRS, I tried this in the mainboard, but quickly moved it to the sideboard because it is absolutely blank against most aggressive and control decks. It excels in the Junk and Thragtusk matchup though, so I put two in the sideboard. Speaking of sideboard...

Rakdos's Return

This is a local meta call for me. None in the mainboard because most of my local meta is Naya blitz/ other aggro, but it is completely plausible to have 1-2 in the main. Mine are in the sideboard, however.

**Sideboard**:

While the sideboard on TappedOut is a little outdated (I was trying out an experimental snapcaster mage package), this is what I'd suggest after some practice with the deck:

4 Deathrite Shaman
2 Evil Twin
2 Rakdos's Return
2 Abrupt Decay
2 Duress
1 Pillar of flame
2 Slaughter Games

While a sideboarding guide would be a little long (and I'm running out of space by now), I'll go into some basic explanations

Deathrite and Evil Twin against Junk because Deathrite gets to hate their graveyard and possibly ramp us early on. It helps us recover from being slimed as well. Evil Twin copies everything in their deck for usually a lot less mana than they're paying for it.

Abrupt decay and pillar of flame for aristocrats (or Naya Blitz) usually. Abrupt is good against reckoner in general, and this deck really struggle with killing a Skirsdag High Priest without Nightshade Peddler (which you have to side out because of its weakness to tragic slip).

Duress, Slaughter Games, and Rakdos's Return are a great mix for the control decks. Duress let's you grab wraths early on and gets you information. Slaughter games provides a way to deal with sphinx's revelation (or angel of serenity if needed) and gives you the upper hand on advantage with prime speakers. Rakdos's Return is the hand killer that can get them late for their entire hand (most of the time) and simultaneously fireball them for a ton.

**Matchups**:

General information about the more common matchups.

Naya Blitz

Usually very easy. Your creatures are better than theirs after ~turn 5 and it isn't very hard to stall that long with peddler, staticaster, and borderland ranger. You play so many big drops that either draw cards or gain like that you shouldn't have that much of a problem. Their lack of mainboard removal allows staticaster and peddler to crush their creatures.

Junk Rites

I find this matchup to also be favored on our side. Their superficial amounts of removal make peddler/staticaster great and olivia can steal all of their threats with ease. Watch our for angel of serenity and try to make it so that you have an out to it at all times, as I feel it's one of the only cards that makes this matchup particularly bad for us.

Esper Control

Peddler and Staticaster/Olivia are usually pretty dead in this matchup, but domri is an all-star. Esper usually only plays a few detention spheres/planar cleansing and an emblem is not outside the realm of possibility by any means. Be careful and try to use domri post combat in case they have azorius charm for one of your creatures.

Running out of words so I'll cut it out here. Would love to hear your questions, opinions, and suggestions!

1365842930.0,21,self.spikes,1c9f2h,[Standard] Dega Control (R/W/B): an attempt to create a new competitive archetype. Tournament report inside.,27,6,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/1c9f2h/standard_dega_control_rwb_an_attempt_to_create_a/,"I became tired of seeing Top-8 finishes with almost nothing but Reanimator, Naya Blitz, Jund, and Esper/Bant Control, so I decided to try my hand at a different kind of control deck: B/W/R. The original idea stemmed from a deck I played on Cockatrice. It focused on creature removal and getting Obzedat out, which was practically the only win condition.  I liked the idea of a removal-based deck, so decided to design my own.  It uses Faithless Looting accompanied with flashback spells for card advantage, and I included a small reanimator aspect as another win condition.

After a bit of tweaking here and there, I entered a Standard Tuesday Night Magic tournament with this [deck](http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/dega-control-25-03-13-2/). Here are the results:




Tournament 1

Round 1 vs. Rakdos Burn: 2-0

Game 1: Both my deck and my opponent's deck drew a bunch of creature removal, stalemated for a while. Eventually, I was able to hammer him down with a single Boros Reckoner.

Game 2: My opponent didn't have a great hand. I ended up getting Olivia Voldaren out and a turn later used Unburial Rites to reanimate Obzedat, sealing the win.




Round 2 vs. R/B Demonic Rising: 2-1

Game 1: This deck revolved on having a Rakdos Keyrune and a Demonic Rising in play to get a steady stream of demons. I made a mistake with Faithless Looting and discarded a Dreadbore and kept a Searing Spear. He played a Bloodgift Demon, ended up getting his combo out, and after playing a Thundermaw Hellkite, dealt me 18 damage in one turn.

Game 2: I played a couple of Lingering Souls and flashed them back. I whittled my opponent down to 3. After a couple turns, I top-decked a Searing Spear and won.

Game 3: Used Slayer's Stronghold and lingering souls to deal heavy damage. My opponent got land screwed, so it wasn't a tough victory.




Rd 3 vs. Esper Control: 0-2

Game 1: Wore him down over and over, but 3 Sphinx's Revelation kept my opponent in the game.  He eventually milled me out. 

Game 2: Sided in Duress, started with 2. Removed a Revelation and Planar Clensing. I had a great board--Assemble the Legion, Sorin, Reckoner, 2 spirits. Then he drew and cast another Planar Cleansing. Next turn--Rest in Peace.  Killed me with Augur, Resto Angel, and Snapcaster.




Round 4 vs. BUG Undying Tempo: 1-2

Game 1: held my opponent for a while, but I ran out of removal. He overwhelmed me with Geralf's messenger, Lotleth Troll, and Dreg Mangler.

Game 2: Cast Olivia Voldaren, pinged lots of things. Only card I needed to win.

Game 3: His Evil Twin copied my Reckoner, and he overwhelmed me again.



In the end, it wasn't a great tournament, but I was able to find some of the weaknesses in my deck.  The biggest thing is that I needed something to deal with 3-toughness creatures besides Searing Spear. Rolling Temblor fell short, and Divine Reckoning was dreadful in the deck. I also ended up sideboarding out Assemble the Legion nearly every match, so I needed to replace those.



After tournament one, I revamped the deck--especially the sideboard. This is the newest [version](http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/dega-control-version-2/). I removed the Divine Reckoning, Assemble the Legion, and Blasphemous Act, and I replaced them with 4 Resto Angels and 2 Runechanter's Pikes. In the SB, I put Slaughter Games in for control matchups and Gloom Surgeons in for Aggro matchups.

Tournament 2

Round 1 vs. G/W Jank: 2-0

Played against a high school student with a thrown-together deck. Both games ended fairly quickly.




Round 2 vs. Miracle Grow Delver (U/G): 0-2

Game 1: Tokens and a Delver wore me down, was never able to gain the upper hand.

Game 2: Stupidly kept a hand with 4 land and 3 Boros Reckoner. Basically just lost to one delver. Couldn't draw any removal.

This match was the worst the deck ever drew. In both games, I really didn't see anything besides Reckoners, Gloom Surgeons, and a couple removal spells. No Resto Angels, Faithless Looting, etc. 




Round 3 vs. Esper Spirits: 2-1

Game 1: All my opponent's spirits ended up being 4/4s, but I was able to kill them off. I made an extremely stupid mistake that ended up costing me the game. I had Obzedat in play and missed the phase-out trigger at the end of my turn. He O-ringed him, got a couple more spirits, and finished me off. This single-handedly lost me the game.

Game 2: My opponent was land-screwed, I kept killing off his spirits, and I won the game with a pair of Reckoners.

Game 3: My opponent could have overwhelmed me with spirits, but he make a game losing mistake and forgot to flash back two Lingering Souls for about 7 turns. I cleared his board just as we ran out of time and went to turns. I took him down quickly using a Resto Angel and a Slayer's Stronghold. On turn 3, my opponent remembered to flash back his Lingering Souls with 2 life remaining. On my turn (turn 4), I used Liliana to make him sac a creature and killed the other with a Searing Spear I top-decked, finishing him off with my angel.




Round 4: Draw into top 8.



Even though I didn't play many matches, I still thought the deck performed better than the first tournament.  I would love any advice for tweaking the deck--especially the sideboard.  I also encourage others to try this deck out and see if it has any potential.

1361553075.0,19,self.spikes,1912sq,One-shot Tourney Decks,26,7,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/1912sq/oneshot_tourney_decks/,"When people look at decks like Conley's ""mono(ish) black control"" the first inclination is that they are inferior to the well-vetted established decks out there.  Everyone thinks ""nifty, but it won't stick"" and moves on.  That's cool, but there's something that people discount about the one shot decks:

They are the only way to truly ""win"" the metagame.

Even though the current meta has a bit of a ""rock-scissor's-paper"" meta, the dominant decks in each category have similarities that can be exploited.  If you build a deck carefully enough, it's possible to build one that stomps ""rock"", beats ""paper"" and does decently against ""scissors"".  Sure, those decks might be able to easily adapt to crush you, but they won't.  This is a one-shot deck (even if you play it at a couple tournaments) that will be retired if it ever becomes popular.

In this thread, I'm looking for brainstorming ideas that discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the top archtypes in the format.  Here's an example:

**Esper Control** - [As played by Ben Stark](http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/ptgtc13/top_8_decks)

* Non-targeted removal with heavy board-wipes
* Heavy card-draw and card-efficiency
* Minimal creatures, all flash-based
* Decking as primary wincon
* Sideboards well against combo decks.

Possible Weaknesses:

* Non-creature-based control  
* Evasive aggro
* Mana intensive
* Combo before sideboard
* No permanent removal


**Jund Midrange** - [As played by Owen Turtenwald](http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/ptgtc13/top_8_decks)

* Efficient, wipe-resistant creatures
* Moderate planeswalker presence
* Solid Hand destruction
* Variety of removal
* Strong sideboard against control
* Moderate (land/creature) ramp component
* Solid X-spell direct damage

Possible Weaknesses:

* Weak against permission before sideboard.
* High curve without ramp.

The common factor between these decks is the pre-sideboard permission.  Both decks have the potential to be vulnerable to combo/permission prior to sideboard.  Both decks are very mana-intensive and vulnerable to an environment that slows down mana availability or enables card-draw.

Anyone else have some ideas/input?

It made an argument that someone could get into Legacy reasonably cheap, and still be competitive. I threw it together with cards I owned and with the help of some friends.

Deck: Mono U Tempo

    2x Archive Trap
    4x Daze
    2x Dismember
    4x Spell Pierce
    4x Thought Scour

    4x Delver of Secrets
    4x Jace's Phantasm
    3x Ninja of the Deep Hours

Sideboard (15) -

    3x Surgical Extraction
    3x Tormod's Crypt

9 Rounds of Swiss:
Round 1: Bant Enchantment Combo - Had no idea what this deck was about. Game 1 I just stormed out with a turn 1 Jace's Phantasm followed by an Archive Trap on his turn after he fetched. Played a 2nd Phantasm and ended it quickly. I wasn't really sure what to board since he didn't play any creatures and I didn't see much so I only added surgical so add synergy with Archive Trap. 2nd game I didn't start out nearly as fast, and put him to 1 life on turn 4. He then got off his combo which made both players bounce permanents which he used to his advantage by using cantripping enchantments, then used a red enchantment to do infinite damage. Game 3 I mulliganed to 5 and his combo went off before I even got 10 damage across. (1-2) (0-1)


Round 2: Mono Red Burn - First game I hit a Phantasm/Trap combo. That 5/5 Flyer was too much for him to handle. Game 2 he layed a Pyrostatic Pillar after laying down Goblin Guides. With that damage advantage and no way to remove it we went to game 3. Finally Delver comes through big time, blind-flipping turn 2. He got stuck on one land while I had a hand full of counters, so the beats added up and I played a Clique late game just to make sure the path was clear (it was) and swung for lethal the following turn. (2-1) (1-1)

Round 3: Show &amp; Tell - One of the few Legacy decks I knew about and was prepared for. Game 1 he had a Show &amp; Tell backed up by a Force of Will so that was ugly. I SB in all my Curfews and Surgicals for any creature hate I had. He tutored for 3 Show &amp; Tell which made a beautiful Surgical Target. I then Surgical'ed his Sneak Attack after I Acrhive Trap'ed him. He actually started the beats with 2 Spirit Apes and I was getting nervous. I had to Snapcaster just to trade twice, then finally started the beats with a pumped Phantasm. Game 3 he kept a 1 land hand with Defense Grid and some Petals. I thought he was going off and was actually relieved when I saw the Grid. I flipped a Delver and started early. He missed his land drops and while at one land I Thought Scour'ed him and Surgical'ed his Misty Rainforest, which I thought was the right move with him land screwed. Turned out not too bad a move as he never got another land, not that it mattered with *3* Curfews in hand. (2-1) (2-1)

Round 4: Mefolfk - Not excited about this match as I've tested against a friend's Modern Merfolk and did not fair well. I got a Delver turn 1 that didn't flip. Turn 2 I dropped another Delver and Ponder'ed to set them up. After flipping I won quickly. Game 2 was awesome for him he his Aether Vial and started with the Lords. Once they start landing there is no answer at all. Mutavault is also something I'm not a fan of. Game 3 he got himself stuck on 1 land with no Vial. I would so I'm sorry for him, but that was way too much of a risk on game 3. I Scour'ed him and hit 2 lands. When he finally hit a second land he was too far behind in board state from a Ninja and 2 Phantasms. (2-1) (3-1)

Round 5: Dredge - Another deck I knew about so I was prepared post SB. First game I got stomped by zombies given these enchantments that were in his yard. I SB all Surgical and Crypt. I had to Mull but had 2 Ponder's and a Preordain. I figured it was enough dig to try to find a SB answer. In retrospect as his deck was so dedicated to the Yard I should've tried to Mull until I hit a Crypt, but this is why the experience was worth playing. Anyway, I missed any hate with all the dig and he stomped with Zombies from sac'ing that 0/1 blue flyer. (0-2) (3-2)

Round 6: MUD - I had no idea what this deck was about. I crushed him game 1, only seeing a few random artifacts.
The second game I saw it going off. He ramped into Wurmcoil Engine and Lightening Greaves for the game. Once I saw it I knew that the Curfews all had to go in. I started the early beats with Delver and had him on the ropes. Kuldotha Forgemaster made me nervous because I saw he put in Ratchet Bomb. After I attacked him and had him within one attack step of winning I Ponder'ed into Curfew. He had to return it to his hand and left him with no other outs. (2-1) (4-2)

Round 7: American Delver - I started with a Delver then Dazed his. I got one attack in before it was Bolted. I was able to slam a turn 3 GoST. I flashed in a Snap to trade. He tried to play another one, but I had another Daze in hand. I had no play and he hit this 3rd GoST. At that point I got crushed. I added in Curfew to help pre-combat. I had a mulligan'ing fit going down to 5 and he hit a bunch of GoST again and I couldn't keep up. (0-2) (4-3)

Round 8: RUG Delver - I was 14 seconds late and got a game loss. I was on the play and dropped a Delver and Dazed his Delver. I dropped another Delver that both of the flipped on my turn. I started the beats with some counter magic. and his Sylvan Library got out-tempo'd. Now that I could SB I threw in the Gut Shots. He started with a Delver that I was able to Gut Shot before laying down one of my own. He ponder'ed before playing a land so I Dazed it. Turns out he kept a one land hand. Mine flipped and started swinging. He tried to Ponder without playing another land so I Pierce'd it. No land again. I laid a Phantasm and another Delver. He finally hit land and started land Mongoose's, but my air advantage was too much to handle. (2-1) (5-3)

Round 9: Storm - So I guess people use storm in this format too. I only saw a Gitaxian probe game 1 before he scooped. I had no SB cards for this match up (Mindbreak where are you??). He was able to go off turn 0 and get 12 tokens. Being honest with myself I just scooped them up. Game 3 he had to mull which I had to assume was crazy risky with that kind of deck. I landed a Phantasm and then he missed his land and passed. I swung and Ninjitsu'd into a daze. He exiled a Spirit Guide for that 1 mana 2 mana producing and I Dazed it. With no land for him I started the beats and kept playing creatures. With him at 3 life he stormed into a Pyroclasm just to stay alive. I landed a Clique and won with that. (2-1) (6-3)

Overall: Finished the day in 52nd. I was really impressed with how a $220 deck functioned. I have to say My first impressions of this format are positive ones. I will definitely be trying to get more into this. I'd appreciate any opinions of changes for this deck and how to broaden the SB to help against different match ups. Thanks!

Scavenging ooze seems like a no brainer for jund.  It has the golden 2 for one ability that jund loves and provides an almost mandatory effect for one of our least favored matchups.  

I want to ask this about it though.  With all the buzz (I'm hearing buzz, let us know how things sound to you) about the ooze do we continue to play ground seal as a way to shut it down?  In the mirror?  Sideboard? Mainboard?  

I'm waffling a litte. Jund has the removal to kill the ooze without missing a beat so maybe ground seel can go?  I'm still leaning heavily towards including the ooze, but want to get some other opinions.

The deck plays lots of very good cards and tries to achieve maximum value from them. The looting package (faithless looting, unburial rites, lingering souls) allows you to sculpt your hand and tailor it to each situation. Whilst looting in itself is card disadvantage by definition, the cards thrown away are always either cards that are of no current use anyway, or cards which provide value in the graveyard and for all intents and purposes the discard is irrelevant, as you simply keep the best cards for the situation. Unburial rites can also simply be used as reckoner/blood baron 5-8.  

In terms of threats, reckoner and blood baron are both great offensively and defensively, and I wouldn't run any less than four of either of them. Aurelia just wins games out of nowhere, and the single angel of serenity solves difficult board states and just provides insane value. I often feel like gideon is one of the best cards in the deck. Unanswered he will win games very quickly, and behind a wall of reckoners and lingering souls tokens it's very difficult to deal with him. 

Liliana is probably the best card in the deck, providing answers to bant hexproof (an otherwise difficult matchup), always trading for atleast 1 creature, and otherwise just grinding down their hand. She prays on decks with slow starts, or players who keep bad hands. In combination with the discard package in the sideboard, this deck can really tear apart an opponents hand and library, whilst you drop lots of very difficult to answer threats.

I like curse of death's hold. Whilst expensive, it just wins against aristocrats and zombies and in midrange matchups it makes your creatures just flat out better than their's, and prevents junk decks from using lingering souls. When drawn in other matchups, it can just be discarded to looting or liliana, but I feel like it's slot is warranted by how much better it makes certain matchups for you game 1.
  
The removal package can be tailored to your personal needs. WBR has access to some of the best removal in standard, and so you don't need to play anything but the best. Pillar of flame is as good as it's ever been with the number of voice of resurgence about, but I have decided to push them to the sideboard as they're not good in every matchup.   
  
What are everybody's thoughts on this? My list is slightly more tailored towards aggro then it could be to reflect the meta in my area, but the list is very versatile.

A few observations to start the discussion:

* Assume that 3 colors is standard.
* Guildgates seem to be worth taking in your top 5 picks.
* Cluestones should be in your last 5 picks.
* Prioritize a Gatecrash guild in your first pack to increase the likelyhood that it will be passed back to you in pack 2.
* 4 and 5 color trash is quite playable.

Some of the better color combinations:

* WBr:  Good combination for aggro or control.  If your table is fairly stable, you're likely to be able to get a good pool from one of those.  A couple [Tithe Drinkers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=368970) is a great start for either version of this deck.  After that, you have options depending upon what's open.

* WUx:  Azorius tempo seems solid with or without a splash if you can find it open.  Several under-drafted GTC cards synergise very well:  [Keymaster Rogue](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=366380), [Totally Lost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=366433), [Void Walk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=366474) and any white Boros card.1. 

* BRx:  Rakdos is still pretty damn fast.  Combined with some new burn and playable GTC red and black cards, you have some strong aggro with more utility and removal than was available in RtR.

* Four color trash:  While green should still be your core, many people are taking gates way too late or trying to force 2-color decks.  This leaves the door open to cherry picking some powerful bombs later in the draft.  The gatekeeper rotation and under-drafted cards like [Hold the Gates](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=366276) add some late-pick options.  The biggest concern is probably the stress to your mana curve with too many 4-drops, but considering that most of your non-gate fixing acts as 3-drop ramp, it works out reasonably well.

**Master of Cruelties** - Seems like a good sideboard against control, especially big life gainers such as Bant control. Pop it in if you notice a lot of Thragtusks or Sphinx's, probably only a 2 of though, with no mainboard due to its high cost.

**Puetrify** - Great card for both sideboard and main. Instant speed removal, and the tacked on abilities just add to its utility (though, to be fair, not many artifacts currently see standard play.) Still, 3 cmc is a bit expensive for an aggro that typically aims for a very low mana curve, especially when it has beefy, hasted creatures to play instead.

**Spiked Jester** - Burning-tree variants may not consider this an option, but not only does it evolve Experiment One, it's also a hasted 3 power on turn 2. Useful, just a bit off color for the currently favored 2 drops.

**Blood Scrivener** - As with Spiked Jester, there is slightly less synergy here as there is with other, currently used, 2 drops. Still, the card advantage for aggro is great, especially considering how often and quickly Jund Aggro can empty its hand onto the field. Definite mainboard possibility.

Well I did, and it has been testing very well. 

Link: http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/bant-flash-25-04-13-1/

First the Creatures: All of the creatures are 3 ofs, except for Deputy of Acquittals (mostly because I haven't tested him much). I settled on 3 ofs since I will see each of them, often in multiples, throughout the game, but I need to see a lot of my other spells in order to survive many of the decks in the meta.

Yeva, a 4/4 body for 4 mana with flash is deadly, even though I'm not using her to give other creatures flash (except in the sideboard), the creature is so mana efficient it is insane, and is often one of the biggest bodies on the board.

Wolfgir Avenger, 3/3 for 3 mana with regenerate? This guy will very rarely die, and eats Thragtusks for breakfast.

Snapcaster Mage, with 19 instants in the deck, I don't think I need to say any more.

Restoration Angel, currently only blink's snapcaster well, but helps avoid spot removal and is a 3/4 flying body of her own.

Deputy, currently testing, to avoid spot removal and reset snapcasters.

Instants:

Advent of the Wurm, this card is simply nuts. No one expects a 5/5 to drop for 4 mana at instant speed, many players will swing right into one. And the trample is highly relevant. 

Cackling Counterpart, a 3 mana snapcaster at best, at worst a 3 mana 3/3. Solid. Flashback at instant speed is great in late game. (Though you often don't get to late game)

Charms: Making a 2/2 is a sweet way to stall from those aggro swings, but the pump is nice too. Also, answering a Tragtusk or bigger, also good. ...Basically all forms of all 3 charms are used to good effect here. 

Countermagic: At its heart this is a tempo deck, and so a decent countermagic suite is good. Plasm Capture is sick, but it is a shame you have to spend the mana on your main phase. Turn 2 Syncopate on their Burning Tree is often game over for the aggro player. 

Rootborn is currently being tested for effectiveness. But, dodging a board sweeper and making another 5/5 is a dream.

Sideboard: Currently in flux, but more countermagic, some useful (and green) creatures, and more protection vs. control builds.

With the full DGM spoiler released, I've been thinking about how to best take advantage of the new cards.  The card I'm the most interested in trying out are Sire of Insanity and Ral Zarek (it helps that Ral can ramp to T5 Sire) so Grixis is the most logical conclusion.  

This is a preliminary list I came up with:

    3 Snapcaster Mage
    3 Sire of Insanity
    3 Olivia Voldaren
    9
    3 Think Twice
    2 Forbidden Alchemy
    4 Turn // Burn
    3 Far // Away
    2 Dreadbore
    3 Cyclonic Rift
    1 Sever the Bloodline
    2 Izzet Charm
    20
    2 Liliana of the Veil
    4 Ral Zarek
    6
    4 Steam Vents
    4 Watery Grave
    2 Blood Crypt
    4 Sulfur Falls
    4 Drowned Catacomb
    2 Dragonskull Summit
    1 Island
    1 Swamp
    1 Mountain
    2 Cavern of Souls
    25

    Sideboard:
    
    2 Rakdos Charm
    4 Izzet Staticaster
    1 Sire of Insanity
    2 Evil Twin
    2 Underworld Connections
    3 Duress
    1 Dreadbore

My thoughts are:

1. EOT Overloaded Rift followed by Sire = gg.
2. Against Aggro, the deck has plenty of 2 mana removal spell to stay alive until an Olivia or Ral comes online.  After that, I don't see Aggro becoming an issue.
3. Against Midrange, most of the removal can function late game until a resolved Sire or Olivia.  
4. Against Control, resolved Sire = gg.
5. Reanimator is probably the worst matchup pre-board but that can be shored up post-board.  Bouncing things are generally better in the early game anyway.



Other cards I've thought about but either no space or don't think it's as good:

1. Mizzium Mortars: I feel that Dreadbore is just better at this slot.  The option to hit PW seems more relevant compared to the option to overload.  I also don't want to Mortars a Reckoner whereas Dreadbore happily does that job.
2. Jace: don't think he does near enough compared to Ral.
3. Bolas: too slow.  This isn't a Gilded Lotus build.
4. Counterspells: permissions in general don't seem to mesh w/ Sire.

Cards I want to fit in but I don't think is as good as the current 75:

1. Tamiyo: more PW based control build.  Might be interesting to try.
2. Rakdos Keyrune: 5 on turn 4 is pretty good for all of the fuse cards.  Not sure if worth it.
3. Staff of Nin: don't know if I can fit in that many 6 drops.
4. Aetherling: feels like this deck wouldn't get to the amount of mana needed to run this guy out successfully.

- Competitive Magic Community, 2012-13

_______________________________________________________

**Background**

A few weeks ago, someone submitted a Daily Event deck sheet (either here or the main sub-reddit) that was championed by a Bant Delver list. My roommate proxied the deck up, anxious to try something new, and, immediately, we saw how powerful the deck was. Even without the ability to profitably line-up Delver flips, the deck can still perform, with great success, as an intense tempo deck. 

______________________________________________________

**The Deck**

[For reference, here's the list I piloted to a 4-3 finish at a PTQ on Saturday.](http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/bant-delver-08-04-13-2/)

I just love playing this deck. The versatility is phenomenal, and it can be adjusted nicely to fit around the meta. This deck eats Reanimator alive (at least it did in my playtesting), puts a tight clock on slower decks, and pulls all of its shenanigans against Aggro. 

*The Guys*

- 4x Delver of Secrets
- 4x Snapcaster Mage
- 4x Geist of Saint Traft

I'm not really sure much needs to be said about these choices. Snapcaster is an all-star in a deck with such a low average CMC. Geist of Saint Traft turns Rootborn Defenses and, to a lesser extent, Druid's Deliverance into back breakers. 

The original list ran Cloudfin Raptor. I played with him for a week or so and wanted to rip the card in half most of the time. Yes, it works incredibly well with the populate strategies, and Geist of Saint Traft in general, but other times it just felt like a dead spot on the board, especially given that I've won a lot of games on the back of a single Insectile Aberration or Geist of Saint Traft

*The Other Guys*

- 4x Selesnya Charm
- 3x Call of the Conclave

I hate Call of the Conclave with every fiber of my being, but I'll be the first to admit that the hatred is somewhat illogical. A creature that flips Delver is awesome, and a 3/3 for GW is really impressive. *But it's a damn sorcery.* 

Your second or third turn, depending on who went first, is basically the most important turn in the game. Best case scenario: I pull out a back-breaking tempo play (e.g., Spell Rupture your Farseek if you're on the play, Unsummon the Lightning Mauler you dropped with Burning-Tree Emissary so that your Boros Elite trigger doesn't go off, etc.). Worst case scenario: you play nothing and I get to make a Vigilant 2/2 guy before I untap. It's not as great as the 3/3, but I was still able to make other plays if needed. You'll notice that my ideal play is not ""I spend two mana on my turn so that you can do whatever the hell you want on your turn."" Call of the Conclave is infuriating in that regard. I've struggled about finding more relevant, instant speed stuff to do, but more on that later.

*The Stuff*

- 4x Selesnya Charm
- 3x Simic Charm
- 3x Azorius Charm
- 2x Spell Rupture
- 2x Syncopate
- 2x Rootborn Defenses
- 1x Druid's Deliverance
- 1x Faith's Shield
- 1x Giant Growth

Selesnya Charm is the VIP in this deck. Every mode is relevant right now, whether it's punishing you for blocking with a Soul token, exiling that guy you just Bloodrushed, or giving me an extra swinger. Simic Charm is also quite good. Mass hexproof is incredibly silly, and the other two modes provide wonderful versatility. Azorius Charm is something I added on my own. I didn't like that this deck had no draw power. Having a cycling card that I can also use to get something out of the way is too valuable to ignore.

The 2/2 split on Spell Rupture and Syncopate is something that keeps me up at night. Naturally, either one can be a completely useless counter, but this deck doesn't want to be running the unconditional Dissipate. I have to admit that I get a sick sort of pleasure when I can functionally Mana Leak someone's Sphinx's Revelation. 

Rootborn Defenses and Druid's Deliverance are *so incredibly good.* At worst, I can use them to populate the Knight or Centaur tokens (or stave off a lethal swing). In an ideal world, at least with Rootborn Defenses, I'm keeping my Geist alive and then dropping in a 4/4 Flying blocker. And then I'm going to untap and run your over.

I've even gotten to Druid's Deliverance on a 'Hoof swing, which felt wonderful. What's especially nice about these cards is that they're rogue cards. I can't tell you how many times I've seen Aggro players curiously tilt their heads when I declare no blockers.

Giant Growth is nice, especially since I can use it to block just about anything with an Insectile Aberration, but it's a miserable top deck, of course. Faith's Shield is the weakest card, I think. I've used it to great success, but it just doesn't feel good enough. The 1-of was an experiment, and I'm not thrilled with my results.

________________________________________________

**PTQ-ing**

4-3 isn't setting the world on fire. Allow me to qualify why I'm not dissatisfied with this in a mini-tournament report. 

**Round 1 - Fognidoor - 2-0**

I hadn't expected the match-up, and was a little worried about it once I figured out what I was playing, and then I started drawing my counters. I thought Game 2 might shift unfavorably, but I managed to defeat the deck quite handily

**Round 2 - Barely Boros - 2-1**

I lost Game 1 to double Boros Reckoner and Hellrider. It was about as explosive a start as the deck could've accomplished. After sideboards, I brought in Druid's Deliverance, which he kept walking straight into. 

**Round 3 - Esper Control (Shaheen Soorani) - 1-2**

Going in, I pegged Esper as my worst match-up (the day's matches taught me something different, but more on that later). Shaheen is the first pro I've ever played against, and, frankly, there aren't many people I'd rather have played. He was incredibly friendly and we played an enjoyable round of Magic. He had a very slow start in Game 1, and I managed to drop him to 4...and then I started picking up lands. When I ran out of gas, he was able to accelerate and turn the game around. I took Game 2 very handily thanks to Syncopate on Lingering Souls and Rootborn Defenses the following turn. Game 3 was just a blow-out. I picked up my opening seven and saw two Loxodon Smiter, two Selesnya Charm, and **three** blue/white lands. Just one damn green land probably would've let me take that game with relative ease, especially since he dropped a turn three Liliana of the Veil. Instead, I mull to four, thanks to no lands at six or five, and Shaheen advances on (he started off 5-0 and then, sadly, lost in the final two rounds. Brian Braun-Duin did wind up winning the whole day after going 6-0-1, with an astounding 12-1 performance in the swiss). 

I was happy to play such a competent Esper player. Game 2 went so much better than I imagined and showed me that this deck can actually stand up to Esper.

**Round 4 - Prime Speaker Bant - 0-2**

I could not have lost this round any more spectacularly if I tried. I stuck threats early in both games, but Loxodon Smiter into Restoration Angel into Thragtusk is just too oppressive for the version I took to the tournament. This showed me that, of all the established decks in the meta, Prime Speaker Bant is hands-down the toughest one (I imagine any sort of Big Naya/Wolf-Run Bant lists could also be problematic, but I haven't seen much of them lately). 

**Round 5 - Red Deck Wins - 0-2**

This is where the wheels fell off. Disclaimer: I have a horrible habit of being unable to sleep the night before big Magic events. The night before the PTQ, I was only able to sleep for an hour-and-a-half or so. I was functional, but really hoping for a chance to get some caffeine before the event. Unfortunately, a late start and a GPS screw-up prevented any such effort. After my round with Shaheen, I started to feel just terrible. I took the loss from Shaheen in stride and resolved to press on, but I just couldn't keep my damn eyes open. 

I was basically non-functional at this point. I let my opponent Searing Spear an Insectile Aberration while I had a Giant Growth in-hand, profitably block Geist of Saint Traft while I had a Rootborn Defense in-hand, and whack me for lethal while I had a Druid's Deliverance in hand. 

Since our game ended so briefly, I was able to run for a Starbucks. Three shots of espresso later, and, baby, I had a stew goin'.

**Round 6 - UWR - 2-1**

I also pegged this as an abysmal match-up, but was pleasantly surprised by the deck's performance here. I dropped Game 1 on a mulligan to four, which got me Temple Garden, Sunpetal Grove, Snapcaster Mage, Selesnya Charm. I picked up blue source on my third turn but decided to scoop so that my opponent had no idea how to sideboard (at that point, he had seen only two Green/White lands). On the other hand, I had seen a Thought Scour, and whatever that milled, and an Augur of Bolas, so, from where I sat, I was at a pure advantage in Game 2. And sure enough, after winning Game 2, my opponent had to completely change his sideboard. Game 3 was just oppressive: T1 Delver, T2 Selesnya Charm at his end step, T3 Geist of Saint Traft, T4 big swing and Giant Growth on Insectile Aberration to kill his Restoration Angel, followed by a Rootborn Defenses to effectively counter a Supreme Verdict to get me the win. 

**Round 7 - Jund Vampire/Zombie Aggro - 2-0**

Azorius Charm ripped this deck apart. 

_________________________________________

**Ch-ch-changes**

I need to make the Smiter-Angel-Tusk match-up better, so I'm going to jam in two extra Feeling of Dread into the sideboard. That card feels like an absolute super star in that match-up, and it's great in a number of other match-ups.

...and that's it basically. 

I'm really pleased with the performance of the deck. I'm trying to see what I can do to get rid of Call of the Conclave (What's up, Shambleshark?), but, for now, it stays.

1365870076.0,23,self.spikes,1c9vph,[Standard] Changes in Junk Rites,26,3,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/1c9vph/standard_changes_in_junk_rites/,"So I've been playing Junk Rites for a while now and after constant tinkering, this is what I've come up with: http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/junk-rites-13-04-13-2/

What I want to do is continue refining my deck for the WMCQ in DC so that I'm a bit more prepared. To do this, I want to show the reasoning for some of the choices and see what feedback I can get. Anyway, here are the major departures from other lists:

**No Lingering Souls:**
There are a couple reasons for this one really: First against aggro it really doesn't help you all that much. Aggro with green will Wolf Run/Rancor/Ghor-Clan through the puny 1 toughness and Electrickery/Thundermaw makes it miserable. I have never been in a situation where the tokens have been especially good, and more often than not they're a liability. Grisly Salvaging them and then Flashing them back seems cute, but I can usually spend the 2 mana elsewhere and having one more chance for a land/creature has been helpful. I guess the best reason for inclusion is to pump up Craterhoof, but that's usually fine as it is anyway or to block Falkenrath Aristocrat. The problem I see with Lingering Souls against Act 2 is that you're effectively giving them 2-4 more mana for Blasphemous Act and 2-4 more drain triggers off Artist. Maybe I'm really missing something here, but Lingering Souls  just hasn't ever been relevant for me.

**Loxodon Smiters over Centaur Healers/Lotleth Troll:**
I've tried Lotleth Troll and I've just been really disappointed with him. He seems like a good fit, but not big enough to soak up trample, and the supposed upside of discarding creatures is card disadvantage and puts you too heavily into the most easily disturbed line of play Junk Rites has to offer. Regen is good against Control, but that's not really as much of a problem for Junk, you need more against Aggro. Lotleth Troll is just not the defensive card we need. I was enamored with Healer for a while, thinking that 6 points of life/toughness was better than 4 but 3 toughness means you'll trade/lose against most aggro creatures or just get Speared and then smashed. Loxodon at least offers a 2-for-1 on most of those combats or trades with cards just out of reach of what Centaur Healer could deal with. He either makes them take unfavorable trades/card disadvantage or pseudo fogs. He also is a bit better against Hexproof decks that counter anything that gets in the way of Traft or some tempo lists.

**Acidic Slime in the Main:**
This has just been TOO GOOD. Reanimating/Restoration Angel-ing Slime has just shut off so many decks and deathtouch lets us trade well. Its probably the best against control decks, and against Junk, the battle is really about mana.

**2 Caverns Main:**
One of the easiest ways for decks to disrupt this is dissipate/syncopate. Against Prime Speaker, you always get to play Acidic Slime/Angels. I want a second Vault, but not making color is a problem and Cavern can do this in a pinch.

**SB Choices:**

**Diving Reckoning:**
Sever the Bloodline has been really bad for me. Against Aristocrats, you only ever get one creature and if its Falkenrath, you've most likely already taken the damage. Divine Reckoning clears the board of all Cartels, Reckoners, Blood Artists, Paladins...everything except Falkenrath and maybe an errant spirit token and that's fine. You also get value as you might have destroyed a Thrag and have a 3/3 in addition to whatever you saved. Its also great against Blitz where they overextend so much and even if they're left with their best guy, blocking one is much easier especially when you have a blocker as well.

EDIT: Link and stuff

**Liliana:**
I'm kinda sad that I have her to be honest, but against Hexproof, she's really good. Also decent against control.

**Garruk:**
Beats the tar out of the mirror because smacking their mana dorks is good. Smack a dork, flip, chain slimes/restos and deny mana.

Against Junk Rites its really good at denying them mana to do things which is really what the matchup is about. Control has a hard time dealing with losing their Drownyards/mana for bigger X's for Revelation and sometimes I can keep them off double blue or white. What I really need to do is improve the aggro matchup because that's been really difficult for me lately. Of course, this was when I was still running Lingering Souls instead of an extra Smiter and Restoration Angel, but I think maybe the SB also needs some tuning. Devour Flesh instead of Liliana? More Slips? Its really hard to say.

To combat this, I've been testing and brewing a few different versions of the Bant Hexproof deck that won GP Atlantic City. I've tried sticking with Bant colors, but also UWR (for Boros Charm, Reckoner, and Madcap Skills) and even four-color (to splash Boros Charm). I personally prefer versions of the deck without the mana dorks, and I could throw up lists later if anyone is interested.

The deck is a little soft to Supreme Verdict, but holding up mana for Boros Charm isn't too difficult since you generally only want to play one threat at a time. Invisible Stalker really shines against the decks playing Angel of Serenity and Thragtusk. The lifelink from Gift of Orzhova (and perhaps Nearheath Pilgrim) gives the deck some breathing room against the aggro matchup.

Has anyone else tried these decks lately?",,False,,t5_2utkz,False,,,True,t3_1b6wgw,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/1b6wgw/standard_has_anyone_been_testing_aurashexproof/,

Merciless Eviction in Jund?,29,9,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/1aiova/dont_call_it_new_tech_merciless_eviction_in_jund/,"SCG DC had me down. I took Jund, which I had been putting up great results with post Gatecrash. These last couple of weeks, I had been back and forth between the ratio of Bonfires and Mizzium Mortars. We all know the pros and cons of both, but playing this weekend, had me hating both. So what’s out there right now on the other side of the board? Well for me it was Boros Reckoner, Angel of Serenity, Falkenrath Aristocrat, Gerraf’s Messenger, Boros Charm, Assemble the Legion, Olivia Voldaren, and Unburial Rites. You draw that Mizzium Mortar to only realize that you can’t kill big angels, Olivias with +1/+1 counters, Falkenraths that have friends with her, only half of a Messenger, that they can just make everything indestructible, or that they will just get more 1/1 Haste Soldiers next turn. Bonfire, when miracled is of course, a blowout. Otherwise you can kill all the three toughness creatures when you make it to 7. Half the time I’d draw one of these late just to sigh looking at their Boros Reckoner(s) and then at my life total. 

So Jund has me down. I love the archetype. I wanted something new and exciting. Now I’m not Reid Duke, Gerry Thompson, or Patrick Chapin, so I know I’m not going to personally break the format. But there has to be something that will throw my FNM, Open, GP, PTQ, or IQ opponents for a loop. Anything is worth a try. 

I asked myself what I wanted. I want a sweeper! I want a reset button. But I want more than “destroy”. A light bulb went off; I grabbed my trade binder and found it. Merciless Eviction. Six mana? Well that’s a Mizzium overloaded. That’s a bonfire for 2.5. Six isn’t too much. It only asks for one white mana. 

Now let’s take a look at its other uses: Choose one — Exile all artifacts; or exile all creatures; or exile all enchantments; or exile all planeswalkers. Assemble the Legion? Witchbane Orb? any Planeswalker? Gone Exile all the creatures. 

I started testing. I love it. Bear in mind, its minimal testing as of right now. I’m trying three at the moment. Without need for eventual triple red, I cut a Forest, Swamp, Blood Crypt, and Stomping Ground for x2 Temple Garden and x2 Godless Shrine, still have to cast Garruk at triple green. Jund plays minimal creatures. I prefer Vampire Nighthawk over Arbor Elf at the moment. If I drop a Nighthawk which either trades, deters, or gains some life and gets me to 6 mana, it did it's job. If Huntmaster is still alive and impacting the board, then no reason to sweep just yet. And i'm fine with casting a Thragtusk, gaining 5 life, being a blocker, and then leaving behind a beast after I sweep. I’m throwing this out there now for feedback. Maybe there is something I haven’t thought of. I value other’s opinions.

I recently started playing modern and I'm really excited about the format.  I began with the Swasey UWR Geist build that's become popular recently, but I felt like there were times where I reached a game state I couldn't come back from, so I decided to try a pure control build ala Wafo-Tapa, and I'm much happier with the results.  I started with Wafo-Tapas list, which calls for only 3 snaps in the main as the entire creature base, and decided I wanted 3 cliques as well, because they're instant speed disruption, and provide an early clock.  So the list I went in with is here:

http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/mdn-uwr-control/


Round 1 (1-2) - R/B Burn

I went in thinking this matchup would be heavily favoured in my opponents favour, but I was pleasantly surprised.  Game 1 he overran me too quickly and I flooded out drawing into 3 consecutive think twices.  Game 2 I managed to remove/counter his threats until his hand was depleted, and then my draw capability and colonnades sent me in for the win.  Game 3 I mistimed a timely reinforcements (pure misplay, this cost me the game) by attacking before I cast it, so that was dumb.  Then I made the further mistake of deciding to counter his threats rather than let them go through and get off a big revelation that would've surely given me the steam I needed to close it out.  Round goes to him purely through my own misplays.  Lesson learned, but I feel like with tighter play this isn't actually a bad matchup, and this persons deck consistently top 8s events so that actually gives me confidence about the deck.


Round 2 (2-0) - Tron

Game 1 he was focusing on dropping wurmcoils which I kept pathing, finally he eye of ugined for a ulamog (maybe he didn't have emrakul at all?), I cliqued it out of his hand, and got in with clique and colonnade for lethal.  Game 2 I saw an opening hand with two mana and a stony silence, snap keep, shut down his entire hand, colonnades finished the job.


Round 3 (2-0) - Jund

First Jund of the day, he opted for thruns and fulminator mages, banking on a Tron heavy meta.  This was a matchup where the deck truly shined, he attacked his own life total with lands, thoughtseizes, and bobs, while I kept him off his threats and finished with a clique and a lightning bolt.  Game 2 went more or less the same way.  I feel like any jund variant is a fantastic matchup for this deck since it has enough removals/counters to keep them off their threats for the first 5-6 turns until their hand depletes and you can get off a revelation or two, it's pretty tough to come back from that.


Round 4 (2-0) - Fish

Fish, another 'fair' deck, was also a fantastic matchup, being able to keep them off their creatures is devastating for them, their creatures don't have any kind of evasion, so one for oneing their threats and finishing off with batterskull/colonnades/cliques is very efficient here.  Game 2 was only strengthened by verdicts.


Round 5 - Draw into top 8


Round 6 (2-0) - Junk/Jund

This was a Junk variant on Jund running Wilt Leaf Lieges and Loxodon Smiters , as well as the usual Jund suspects (no red).  Once again I feel like this is a very fair matchup for me because I have the removal to keep him off his creature base, in game 2 he overplayed into a verdict on turn 4 and then I landed a clique to get the rest of the way.  Liliana didn't particularly worry me in this matchup because I managed to keep a fairly well stocked hand so I had counters or lands to throw away.  Finished him off with a colonnade, clique, and electrolyze to the face.


Top 4 split.


A major competitor at the event were the eggs decks, luckily I didn't have to go up against them, but everyone was talking about losing consistently to them.  There wasn't enough hate, and apparently these things were going off on turn 3 consistently.  This event was a qualifier so I'm going to start packing more graveyard hate vis a vis relic of progenitus for the main event next week.

I feel pretty happy with the deck.  Originally I was playing two cryptics because I only have two and was ready to buy two more, but now I feel like I'm actually happier with just 2.  It's nice to be able to hit one later in the game or snap one back, but I worry about getting several stranded in my hand before turn 4.  it can also be hard sometimes to consistently hit triple blue by turn 4, so I'm going to stick with two.

All stars today were path, batterskull, clique, and revelation.  Revelation is an interesting topic because as it began to be played in modern in the UW decks, people often remarked that it's too slow for the format.  In this deck I think it really shines though.  Basically the premise of the deck is to 1 for 1 your opponent until about turn 5, then your opponent may begin to run out of steam and you can start aggressively think twicing to make land drops up to 6-7, then you can revelate for a large number to stabilize your life total, and at that point you should have enough mana and cards in hand to keep your opponent completely locked down.  It's not uncommon to sneak a clique in end of turn and then burn your opponent out for another 3-6.

Changes moving forward, I want to add a second batterskull to the side since it's just fantastic in any 'fair' matchup, I want to increase the amount of graveyard hate in preparation for the oncoming eggpocalypse, and I maybe consider going up to 3 revelations in the main.

1359858018.0,20,self.spikes,17sb38,"[Standard] GTC B/R Aggro Discussion, because we like turning our cards sideways.",27,7,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/17sb38/standard_gtc_br_aggro_discussion_because_we_like/,"So, Gatecrash definitely seems to have favored other deck types a little more (Naya looks very scary, and Esper control may make a comeback).

However, for those of us that prefer a simplistic deck, yet consistently like to win, there are a few new tools being brought to the game for our use. Granted, there don't seem to be any truly standout cards for this archetype, but decks like B/R zombies and RDW should be still be a force to be Reckoned with (Ha ha, LSV puns.) after their potential upgrades.

Because most of you are familiar with the staples of the various types, let's just into the new stuff:

**Skull Crack** - Seems like an obvious sideboard because of the current love standard has for Thragtusk. Main board is a bit risky, as there are more effective cards in mirror matches, and more often the burn spells are used for creature destruction rather than flat out damage.

**Legion Loyalist** - Scary 1 drop, seems RDW will want 4 of them. Decent to play turn 1 but becomes a huge menace when dropped on turn 3 with two other creatures. Zombies and Vampires will probably have no use for it though

**Boros Reckoner** - The card everyone seems to be hyping as a new potential 3 drop in many decks. He is powerful, but is there really a deck he'll securely call home? RDW already has Pyreheart Wolf, which can set up some very nasty turn 4 kills. And in non white decks, he's essentially a mono-red card, which can be a difficult cost to pay in many situations

**Burning-Tree Emissary** - A very interesting two drop that may open up potential combos as the meta evolves. One commonly theorycrafted one is to play it and then a Lightning Mauler to swing for 4 on turn 2. Still, it seems a bit specific for general use.

Personally, I believe B/R aggro will still have its place and be as strong as it is, but have to swap around certain utility cards to adapt to the meta. For example, while the bulk of B/R zombies will remain the same, I expect to see many decks packing 3 or 4 Skullcracks in the side board just to deal with new threats.

I've tested a bit online, and it still feels strong, I've gotten consistant wins with my deck against GTC standard decks, but it's really unsure to say what will happen so far seeing as the set is still new. I also tested a Chavest aggro that was essentially regular B/R aggro with Aurelia's Fury, Knight of Glory and Boros Charm splashed. Boros Charm is just as good as they say, and Knight of Glory provided interesting ultility in matches against other B/R aggro, but Aurelia's seems far too slow for aggro, and even then not beneficial enough for the deck type.

Obzedat seems like he'll pose a big problem, being that only instant speed removal will really stop him (not including Ultimate Price), so Orzhov control may be a big contender to try and tackle.

So since RtR has been spoiled, tons of people here on /r/spikes have been discussing UWR Control, and all its various forms and possibilities. Since then, UWR Miracles has made quite a show, but some people (such as myself) have shown their disdain for miracles. If you're like me, you don't like having to get a perfectly-timed topdeck of Entreat the Angels to win, or you don't like having to rely on lucky Termini to win against Zombies. So, I went ahead and made a much more draw-go style of UWR Control: 

http://magic.tcgplayer.com/db/deck.asp?deck_id=1049876

The idea is that cards like Lingering Souls, Jace, and Thragtusk are so powerful against us that counterspells are necessary to survive, and with four Syncopates, Jace becomes a lot worse in our list. Also, with such little creatures, running Niv-Mizzet or Angel of Serenity as a win condition becomes a bit flimsy, since all of your opponent's kill spells have been sitting in their hand the entire game. Tamiyo avoids all of that, and she wins the game just as well. The primary way of winning is to ultimate her and then Pillar of Flame them to death.

Before States, I decided to give this deck a go at my LGS during their Saturday Standard tourneys. Going 4-0 and winning the event was a nice foreshadowing of the next day. When I got to States at GamingETC the day after, I was somewhat surprised to see only about 60 people there, but happy to see all the odd brews people were playing. My tournament went as follows:

Round 1: UWR Miracles. Game one he got stuck on two land on the play for the first 5 turns of the game, and then he made the mistake of mainphasing a Think Twice trying to find a land. It was Syncopated, and I untapped and played Tamiyo and locked down one of his lands. Game two was slightly more interactive, but Geist got there pretty quickly.

Round 2: UW Miracles. This one was pretty interesting. I lost a long game one due to some play mistakes, and won game two pretty quickly off Geist, which he seemed to not have thought of siding in for the control mirror. Game three I made the mistake of playing Geist on turn 5 rather than turn 6, so when he played his own Geist I couldn't Dissipate it. I didn't draw another threat for a very long time, but we both drew plenty of land, and we eventually went to time after about 12 turns of each of us going land-go.

Round 3: Junk. This guy went on to come in 2nd, so I wasn't totally disappointed that I lost to him, but I definitely was on mild tilt from drawing the previous round. Game one I played pretty terribly by trying to Syncopate for 1 his Lingering Souls after forgetting he had an Arbor Elf in play, and I lost after 3 back-to-back Thragtusks. Game two I got a hand with 3 UW lands and a grip full of red spells that I knew were great against him, so I decided to gamble. I lost.

Round 4: UWR Miracles against a well-known friend of mine. This was a very interesting match. Normally going turn-two Snapcaster for beats is very bad in this matchup since I'm a lot more controlling than he is so he should be the beat-down, but when I got the option to  either Dissipate his Tamiyo or Snapcaster a Syncopate, I Snapcastered the Syncopate and ended up getting in for 14 over a long period of time. I ended the game with triple Pillar of Flame. Game two I sided in my Geists, and he couldn't answer them.

Round 5: Rainbow Reanimator. A turn two Grisly Salvage from him showed me what deck he was playing, and I thought I was being given a free win. With 10 mainboard non-creature counterspells, I could cut him off from Chromatic Lantern mana, and with 6 mainboard exiling counterspells, I could deal with his bombs and Unburial Rites very well. I was unfortunately fairly unlucky. Game one, after the aforementioned Grisly Salvage, he plays a turn 5 Thragtusk, which I'm forced to counter. He casts Unburial Rites targeting a Griselbrand in his yard, which I had to counter. He then casts another Rites, and draws 14 off the Griselbrand before I can D-Sphere it. The rest of the game was pretty elementary for him. Game two was particularly interesting. I kept a hand with 4 spells and 3 lands, and by turn 5 I had cast and flashed back two Desperate Ravings and been as unlucky to discard all my spells and draw all lands. My opponent Slaughter Games'd me on his turn 6, saw my hand of 6 land and a Supreme Verdict, and had himself a laugh. I quickly lost.

Round 6: At this point, both my opponent and I were 2-2-1, and the winner would get into top 16. I had seen my opponent playing against a friend earlier, so I knew he was playing Bant Control. After a 37 minute long game one, which involved us both being down to 6 cards in our deck, he plays the last threat in his entire deck, a Thragtusk, while I'm at 3 life and he's at a ton, but he would mill out first. I go for the Syncopate, and realize I'm one land short of syncopating for 14 and countering it. We shake hands, figuring we won't have time for any more games, but I ask the judge how much time we had left just to make sure. I heard 13 minutes, and I said something along the lines of, ""Sweet, that's all I'll need!"" and quickly sideboarded and shuffled up. My opponent looked at me kind of oddly, wondering how I could possibly win two games with my deck in 13 minutes. He too, had never even thought of siding in Geist of Saint Traft against Control. I turn 3 Geist'd him, countered all his threats, and won pretty quickly. I did the same thing game 3, and finished just in the nick of time to grab 13th place. 

Overall thoughts: There was a TON of control. Like, a good 60% of the field was playing control. I was very happy that I came in with a deck that had a good control mirror. I was also very surprised at the number of people who had Geist in their sideboard, but didn't think to side it in in the control mirror. Geist won me a ton of games all day, and I'm definitely not going to less than 4 in my sideboard any time soon. At least twice, I'd lose game one, win game two very quickly with Geist, and see the opponent frantically changing their sideboarding to deal with Geist, as if they'd never even thought of it.

If you took the time to read this whole thing, I warmly congratulate and thank you, and ask that you try out the deck. It's a blast to play (although a bit sadistic), and it's surprisingly powerful.

1345689712.0,19,self.spikes,yoat9,Control in Standard [Lists Inside],26,7,46,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/yoat9/control_in_standard_lists_inside/,"Hi all!

So if you're like me, you're a Spike, and you love Control. Not all Spikes love control, but what I can tell you is that if you are a Spike who is legitimately good at this game, Control will often give you the most tools to work with to utilize your skills. This is not to say that Control takes more thought or skill than Aggro. Rather, the options given to Control players often allow more lines of play over a longer game, rather than trying to find the most efficient and effective way to win with one single line of play. For this reason, I am particularly fond of piloting Control decks. 

If you have been keeping up on some of Wizards' development team and their opinion on Spells vs Creatures in modern Magic, you know that there has been quite the effort to push Creatures into the forefront of magic, and pull Spells back to a supporting role. This is mainly because Creature battling is more attractive and tangible to new players, while sitting on Counterspell for four turns in a row not doing anything seems counterproductive to a newer player. 

As a result of R&amp;D's current outlook on spells vs creatures, Control decks in standard are becoming weaker. Undying creatures are often annoying to deal with for a Control deck, and Mana Leak is oftentimes too unreliable in this format due to Cavern of Souls and the fact that Mana Leak, is, well, Mana Leak, and is by design sometimes unreliable. That doesn't mean that control is dead though! So, without further ado, I present to you some of the control decks that I think can be good in this format.

[First up is Esper Control.](http://magic.tcgplayer.com/db/deck.asp?deck_id=1033604) This is a draw-go list that wins by stalling the game, having answers to everything the opponent plays, and eventually winning with Elesh Norn, Grave Titan, Batterskull, Nephalia Drownyard Mill, or Lingering Souls beatdown. Between Terminus, Forbidden Alchemy, and Curse of Death's Hold, Esper has the best tools of the color combinations in my opinion. However, to be very honest, this list is good, but it is my least favorite here. The reason is because it can play somewhat awkwardly. Lingering Souls and Mana Leak do not play well together oftentimes. Against an aggressive deck,  you're forced to make the decision, ""Do I play Lingering Souls to absorb some damage, or do I keep Mana Leak up for his Geralf's Messenger/Huntmaster/Restoration Angel/Geist of Saint Traft?"" For this reason, I personally prefer the next Esper list.

[This is Shaheen Soorani's Esper Superfriends list.](http://magic.tcgplayer.com/db/deck.asp?deck_id=1019903) It gives up counterspells completely in favor of board control through Planeswalkers and Lingering Souls. I can tell you that this list is very finely tuned, with the exception of a few singletons in the sideboard. By taking the Planeswalker route, you sometimes put yourself in a position where the power level of your cards just completely outclass that of your opponents and there is nothing you can do to win. While this deck is a lot better against decks like Zombies, it is occasionally weak to Trading Post decks that have a ton of inevitability on you. This gets better after sideboard though, where Memoricide can rip the action out of the opponent's deck. Overall, this is close to my favorite list here. 

[Third, I have Frank Lepore's Gilded Grixis list.](http://magic.tcgplayer.com/db/deck.asp?deck_id=1035270) I think Grixis has a ton of potential, but honestly, I don't particularly care for this list. Grixis has some great tools in the form of Pillar of Flame/Galvanic Blast, Whipflare, Bonfire, and Slagstorm, all of which are very good, but I don't particularly like the idea of Gilded Lotus into Fatty. The reason being, if you draw your cards out of order, they don't do anything. There will be games where you draw all of your bombs and no ramp, and games where you draw multiple Gilded Loti (assuming that is the right pluralization), but no bombs until you have plenty of mana anyway. For that, I think that while Grixis is very good, this list is merely a placeholder. If any of you have an alternative list, feel free to post in the comments.

[Finally, I have Smi77y's Tusk Control list.](http://magic.tcgplayer.com/db/deck.asp?deck_id=1033826) This is definitely my favorite list, but it needs some explanation. First, it may look like a Midrange deck, or even a slow Aggro deck, but this deck is definitely Control. It simply controls differently. Here's how: First, Elvish Visionary acts as the Think Twice of this deck. It immediately draws you a card, and then it can do one of a few things. It can either chump to gain you life, trade with a smaller creature and give you card advantage, get pumped by Ajani to trade with a bigger creature or demand a removal spell, or it can be blinked with Restoration Angel for value. Blade Splicer is another great control card in this deck. It is a brickwall for many of the aggressive decks in the format, and if they can remove the Golem, you still have the 1/1 body to perform similar functions as the Elvish Visionary. Restoration Angel is a swiss army knife in this deck. It draws you cards, makes golems, or gains you life and a beast. Not to mention, it swoops in at instant speed with its large rear end to block. Of course, Thragtusk is the centerpiece of this deck. Usually, if you play one and either copy it or blink it, it's very hard to lose. Other supporting cards of the deck are pretty self explanatory. If you think this deck is interesting, I invite you to try it out. It is currently my go-to deck in Standard, and I've already made nearly $100 in store credit off of it in two weeks.

Well, those are my favorite control lists in Standard at the moment. In hard times like these, it is important to remember: Control is always the best deck.",,False,,t5_2utkz,False,,,True,t3_yoat9,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/yoat9/control_in_standard_lists_inside/,

1375478476.0,18,self.spikes,1jl8tj,G/W Elves: Resiliency Vs. Beatdown,27,9,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/1jl8tj/gw_elves_resiliency_vs_beatdown/,"I've been playing Elves since M14s release.  The deck has come along nicely and it was great to get some validation by it placing well in the last few weeks (2nd place SCG Open and more).  It's not without it's weaknesses however, and I feel like the deck needs to be tweaked to stay competitve.

For reference, here's the Huey Jensen's 2nd place list: http://sales.starcitygames.com//deckdatabase/displaydeck.php?DeckID=57863

Afew quick things about his standard romp at the open:

- He never played Jund during swiss.  He split his matches against Jund in the top 8. 

- The games he won against Jund were on the backs of poor draws and mulligans on the Jund player's part.  It was obvious he was poorly matched.

- He had very good draws during the finals.  He played Kalonian Hydra on turns 3 and 4.  A seemingly unlosable play.  Wrong. They we're both removed at instant speed via doom blade and putrefy.

 

Now it seems to me the issue is that Huey commited 100 percent to the beatdown plan.  This makes sense as it IS a big dumb green creature deck.  The issue is that not only are big dumb green creatures easily delt with, they don't have haste in this case or a relevant ETB to hedge how poorly they perform against Jund and UWr Removal suites.

This brings me to my recommended changes to his decklist:

4 Arbor Elf

3 Avacyn's Pilgrim

4 Craterhoof Behemoth

4 Elvish Archdruid

4 Elvish Mystic

4 Elvish Visionary

3 Restoration Angel

3 Farseek

4 Thragtusk

Planeswalkers (5)

3 Garruk, Caller of Beasts

2 Garruk, Primal Hunter

Lands (22)

10 Forest

4 Gavony Township

4 Sunpetal Grove

4 Temple Garden

Voice of Resurgence - This card is a hedge against removal as well as being a hate-bearing against UWr.  I realize that both decks run Pillar of Flame.  The way I see it is if I play a turn 1 dork they will pillar of flame the dork instead, and if they don't then I am well on my way to drowning them in sweet sweet Garruk card advantge.  If I follow up with VoR after they pillar my dork I just put them on their heels and can freely cast more elves/garruk without worrying as much about countermagic.  Against Jund VoR is not quite as good I admit, but many of the UWr concepts still apply.  If they pillar a dork they NEED to find another or VoR will let me survive into the endgame where they don't stand a chance against a craterhoof finish.

 
 
Thragtusk-  A great clock that discourages spot removal.  If you can make Jund's removal less efficient you have bought yourself enough time to finish the game.  Against aggro he is the kind of stabilizing.  Without resto angel he isn't quite as good, but he is still very relevant angainst Jund and UWr.  A huge upgrade to Kalonian Hydra in that you aren't dead on board after a doom blade, you just keep smashing.

Restoration Angel - Huge with thragtusk and elvish visionary.  A turn 4 flickered thragtusk is lights out against most decks.  I would love to hear suggestions on choosing between VoR and Resto Angel.


Now a few questions for r/spikes:

-Is the beatdown plan better than the resiliency plan?

-Is voice of resurgence even relevant in this meta?  Is pillar of flame too good?

-With Jund tuning itself to beat the mirror match, does elves gain any advantage?

-Why do you think the pro's aren't playing thragtusk and restoration angel?

-Do you think that other colors are worth splashing for?  For example G/R for Kessig Wolf Run

Thanks for your input, it will help a bunch at my 2K this weekend!

1374711673.0,16,self.spikes,1izssb,[Legacy] RUG Delver Opening Hand,20,4,50,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/1izssb/legacy_rug_delver_opening_hand/,"I'm trying to get some discussion here on RUG Delver, primarily the opening hand and possible plays when you're on the play against an unknown opponent/deck.

I don't have any experience in playing this deck, but I'm interested in doing so (I already own all the cards required to play this) and am really interested in hearing your thoughts on this scenario.

Here's the list for reference:

    Land
    4 Misty Rainforest
    4 Scalding Tarn
    3 Tropical Island
    3 Volcanic Island
    4 Wasteland

    Creature
    4 Delver of Secrets
    4 Nimble Mongoose
    4 Tarmogoyf
    
    Spell
    4 Brainstorm
    4 Daze
    4 Force of Will
    3 Gitaxian Probe
    4 Lightning Bolt
    4 Ponder
    2 Spell Pierce
    4 Stifle
    1 Tarfire

Sideboard here is irrelevant.

Here's the opening hand that we keep. Again, we're on the play:

    Misty Rainforest
    Scalding Tarn
    Wasteland
    Brainstorm
    Ponder
    Stifle
    Delver of Secrets    

My thoughts around this:

First of all, if this isn't a good keep, please let me know. My justification for this keep is that I've got pressure (Delver), two cantrips (Brainstorm and Ponder), disruption (Stifle and Wasteland), and two colored mana sources and on a blind keep this is pretty solid.

* I feel that Wasteland is just a horrible play turn one, we don't know what the opponent is on and this gives us no plays that we can make.
* Misty Rainforest and Scalding Tarn. Their play order is irrelevant, they both fetch the six duals we run in this list.
* I feel that cracking a fetchland to Brainstorm or Ponder blind is not a very good play.
* My dilemma here is whether I play Delver on turn one or hold up Stifle.

My arguments for turn one Delver:

* Delver can apply good pressure. We can immediately untap and Brainstorm to flip into Insectile Aberration as long as there are no shenanigans from our opponent (i.e. Bolt and Plow are what come to mind).

* If we hold up Stifle and our opponent just plays a non-fetchland, we end their turn by either doing nothing or casting Brainstorm -- which I don't feel is a very good play because we would just have absolutely no idea what we're really looking for in terms of answers.

* Additionally, our opponent could simply go dual + turn one threat in which we'd have to Brainstorm for an answer if we thought it was relevant.

My arguments for holding up Stifle:

* We can disrupt their first turn fetchland if they have it.

* Even if they don't have action, we can still play a second-turn Delver with Stifle up.

I understand that my arguments here might not be the most thought out or well justified, so again that's why I'm here to talk.

I'm happy to hear all your thoughts on this matter, because I'm not certain which play I would really make if this scenario occurred.",,False,,t5_2utkz,1374711865.0,,,True,t3_1izssb,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/1izssb/legacy_rug_delver_opening_hand/,

http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/grixis-control-moc-rspikes-edit/  


I posted this in the winning wednesday thread yesterday but it has no responses, hopefully its own thread will see more

So i've been playing around with this grixis control list for a little more than a week now. (http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/grixis-control-moc/)  

Land (25)  
4x Blood Crypt  
1x Desolate Lighthouse  
2x Dragonskull Summit  
3x Drowned Catacomb  
4x Steam Vents  
4x Sulfur Falls  
3x Swamp  
4x Watery Grave  

Instant (10)  
3x Far / Away  
2x Forbidden Alchemy  
3x Think Twice  
2x Turn / Burn  

Creature (9)  
1x AEtherling  
2x Master of Cruelties  
1x Niv-Mizzet, Dracogenius  
2x Snapcaster Mage  
3x Vampire Nighthawk  

Sorcery (9)  
1x Devil's Play  
2x Dreadbore  
3x Mutilate  
3x Pillar of Flame  

Planeswalker (7)  
3x Chandra, the Firebrand  
2x Jace, Architect of Thought  
2x Liliana of the Veil  

Sideboard (15)  
2x Appetite for Brains  
2x Augur of Bolas  
2x Counterflux  
1x Curse of Echoes  
2x Dreadbore  
1x Far / Away  
1x Negate  
1x Pillar of Flame  
1x Rolling Temblor  
2x Turn / Burn  

Essentially the deck has Master of Cruelties as it's primary wincon, and is doing well when it gets 2 for 1s with Far / away. Chandra feels like she really has a home in this deck, as i'm okay with mainphasing fused spells if i get a 2nd copy for free. She also finishes after MoC. I am currently unsure of my threat density though compared to the amount of answers maindeck. Of the wincons, the only one that has underperformed is surprisingly Aetherling. But i believe this is because i haven't faced a control deck yet.  

So far I have tested extensively it against:  

* RG/Naya Aggro - good matchup when RG doesn't have the nuts. board brings in 4th pillar, 2 more turn /burn and the 4th far/away. Currently testing Augur of Bolas in this matchup, staticaster was in that board slot before. Voice is not that big a deal here becaus far / away is an amazing card when i don't have pillar.  

* Naya Midrange - difficult matchup. pre board without 4 dreadbores for hellkites/ reckoners. This matchup feels like it needs countermagic to win against things like selesnya charm, but i don't think i can side anything else out for it. They also generally bring in Garruk Relentless post-board who starts making wolves and is generally a problem as i am not running spear.  

* Jund Midrange - difficult matchup. Garruk (either variant) is a problem unless i can kill them the turn he comes down. Though a sweet play has been using far/away or turn/burn in response to primal hunter's minus to prevent card draw and kill him at the same time. Variants still running Sire also really suck without an answer in hand.  

* Junk Aristocrats - Surprisingly okay matchup. Jace's +1 is very relevant here. Mutilate is very good also. Voice is still not a huge problem. Cartel Aristocrat is the best card that deck has against me though and not saving/having an answer for it usually is a loss though.  

TL;DR: I am looking for feedback on how to improve my midrange matchups, and i want input on my card selection of wincons versus answers. If you look at my tappedout, i have some other cards listed as maybes, but it's plenty possible i'm missing something great. As a side note if any control players can comment on how they feel about facing my deck, as i have yet to test against esper/UWR.

I've been playing Act II for a while now. Just so we're all on the same page, by Act II, I mean the version of the Aristocrats originally popularized by Brad Nelson, featuring Blood Artist and the full set of Lingering Souls over cards like Champion of the Parish and Silverblade Paladin. The deck has gone through a ton of permutations, removing Skirsdag High Priests for Sorins, taking out Orzhov Charms and putting High Priests back in, taking out Sorins and putting in mainboard Obzedats, etc. However, a lot of the base is the same, and only 5 nonlands really change from list to list. The question, however, is what build is the most correct. Here's the base list that likely should not be touched:

4 Cartel Aristocrat

4 Falkenrath Aristocrat

4 Doomed Traveler

4 Blood Artist

4 Boros Reckoner

3 Blasphemous Act

4 Tragic Slip

4 Lingering Souls

4 Godless Shrine

4 Blood Crypt

4 Sacred Foundry

4 Isolated Chapel

4 Dragonskull Summit

1 Plains

You'll notice that there's 8 cards missing from the main deck. Five of them are nonlands, and 3 of them are lands. Here are the most common candidates in question for the nonlands:

* Skirsdag High Priest

* Sorin, Lord of Innistrad

* Orzhov Charm

* Obzedat, Ghost Council

* Sin Collector

Basically, people have been switching back and forth between these. Sin Collector is more popular on mtgo than in paper, but it's a choice nonetheless. As far as the 3 lands go, the only real question is how greedy to get with the mana base. The most common lists will just run 1 Cavern, 1 Plains, and 1 Clifftop Retreat, but some are taking out either the Clifftop Retreat or the Plains for another Cavern or even a Vault of the Archangel.

The other question is, what to do with the sideboard? There's very little consensus on this matter, besides most builds having Mark of Mutiny and Dreadbore. Other common options are Obzedat, Assemble the Legions, Appetite for Brains/Duress, Electrickery, Zealous Conscripts, Intangible Virtue, additional Caverns/Blasphemous Acts/Sorins/Sin Collectors, etc.

So Reddit, what do you guys think is the best build for Aristocrats? What cards best fill those five slots? How greedy should we be getting with the mana? And perhaps most importantly, how do we construct our sideboard?",,False,,t5_2utkz,False,,,True,t3_1g64f1,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/1g64f1/standard_the_best_version_of_act_ii/,

Regarding the Bug-aggro deck I posted here a month ago, I've had a fair amount of success, but quite the opposition. here's the decklist http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/bug-aggro-26-04-13-1/

The things that I've found myself losing most to iiiiis, red deck wins. Since it's so popular online, I've run in to it quite the lot. Against the midrange-y decks its can actually hold it's forte, mainly because Varolz is such a beast. and also, the R/G aggro decks are decks I'm having trouble with, the undying wolfs are very good in this matchup, but when I'm trying to stabilize they just ghor-clan rampager me to death.


I've played it for almost a month now, and I've decided that Bred for the Hunt is just to slow, having blood scrivener in the deck is better.The worst part of Blood Scrivener is that he's so vulnerable, but he's doing quite the work since I usually end up with no cards in hand pretty early. He's fodder to varolz when board wipes happen, and can be pitched to make lotleth troll bigger.   I changed out the bred for the hunts and 1 young wolf for the 3 that is in the deck. Its both a wizard and a zombie, which I can name with the 2 cavern of souls that I've added in the deck. The duskmantle seers are wizards, and lotleth troll and dreg mangler are zombies. So the cavern in the deck are really helping against the few control decks or URW midrange-y decks that I've faced now. so in short:

-2 Bred for the hunt

-1 Swamp

-1 forest

-1 young wolf

-1 Spell Rupture

+2 Cavern of Souls

+3 Blood Scrivener

+1 Syncopate

[Here's the link to the thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/1am74m/standard_uwr_midrange_or_flash/)

I will be attending SCG Seattle and I want to be running UWr since I have been playing it since the beggining of Gatecrash, but I can't seem to pick a list. There are a few choices I have.

**New Lists**

A few new lists have popped up such as the one running Aureila as a 2 of and Angel of Serenity in the Sideboard to recur all of your creatures or get rid of your opponents. I like this list as it can just end a game quickly by dropping the Aurelia. It recently took second place at SCG KC. But a recent deck has caught my eye. At the 2012 MTGO Championship there was a deck tech of a UWR Flash Variant that had Geist and Thundermaw mainboard like I had suggested in my other thread. [The Deck is called ThunderGeist](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sqmf2nPsVlE) it uses Feeling of dread to tap down opposing threats and can deal quick damage with geist of saint traft and end games using Thundermaw. The deck uses a lot of things I had thought up in my last thread and the main diffrences is that the deck is more aggro/control than what I was trying to come up with. I think this deck can end the game quickly before Junk or any other midrange deck that UWr Flash usually has problems with but is more vulnerable to aggro which was our better match up with Boros Reckoner.

**Strengths and Weaknesses**

The UWr Decks have had better match ups against aggro decks with cards like Boros Reckoner but the deck has trouble against things with trample such as Wolfrun Bant, Jund, and Junk Reanimator.

What can we do to have better match ups against these decks? Or is it ""If we can't beat them, join them"" kind of situation?

With the popularity of Junk Reaimator and how good the deck is what is going to bring this deck down?


**Our Match ups**

UWR against your average meta.

*Esper Control*

Esper isn't a bad match up for us with how much damage we can do and with things like Psychic Spiral and Harvest Pyre/Reckoner to battle the milling we can win out of nowhere against this deck.

*Aggro*

With cards like Reckoner and Augur of Bolas chump blocking we can usually survive long enough to either burn them out and put the game out of reach with cards like Sphinx's revelation.

*Naya/Jund(Midrange)*

Big Creatures with Trample and Life gain from Thragtusk really puts us behind and is hard to gain control of the game. Also hard to end the game. But this isn't a good or bad match up if you can play your cards right the game can swing in your favor and you can win the game.

*Reanimator*

With junk it's just hard to do anything they put down Thragtusk and Blink it with Resto and just puts the game way out of reach for us and down comes Craterhoof and that's usually game. Post board you'd bring in graveyard hate and they can just play through it, with mana ramp and cards like Acidic Slime to deal with our Rest in Peace/Tormod's crypt. It's just a miserable match up.

So overall we have good match ups against Aggro but decent against Midrange and horrible against Junk.

Card selection was not optimal, because I had somewhat limited card selection (didn't have access to a fourth Huntmaster or Thragtusk at the time) and wanted to try some things out because I thought they might be good. 

**Thoughts on the deck:**

* I played this because I wanted to play a midrange deck due to my expectation of the field (expected lots of aggro). I had yet to play the deck before the tournament so the list was a first go at building the deck. It is certainly rough. 
* This is like the Bant Midrange deck, but instead of Prime Speaker Zegana, you have access to Aurelia, the Warleader. I'm of the opinion that this change is definitely good- Zegana is sweet and draws you a bunch of cards, but Aurelia just kills them dead. 
* Only one card in the deck was actively bad- Aurelia's Fury. It rarely did anything amazing, and often was just a five mana Lightning Bolt (it did kill an Olivia Voldaren in the finals for me this way). Kessig Wolf Run is better than any spell at closing out games. 
* A lot of decks are cold to Assemble the Legion. It was much better in the main than in the board, since there were less answers. If people are bringing in Oblivion Ring, it's worse since it has no immediate effect. Turning Supreme Verdict and Mizzium Mortars into little more than Falter is sweet. 
* Domri Rade is excellent. Against control it's a three mana Garruk. I definitely want more of the card. 
* Don't play Boros Reckoner in three color decks. It's a good card, but it's not really an impressive five drop. And Gavony Township and Kessig Wolf run are among the best cards in the deck. 
* The Gruul Keyrune is in the board because you want to side out mana dorks a reasonable amount of the time (they're bad vs any sort of wrath), and the deck is mana hungry. I cut two Arbor Elves for an additional Land and a Keyrune in such situations. 
* Cards I feared included Olivia Voldaren and Planar Cleansing. The first you need a removal spell for. The second is a card fights any nonland trump against the control decks. Mortars was also annoying and made me realize that everything in the deck has four toughness. 

**Tournament summary**

Over the course of five rounds I played against a strange deck (it curved Invisible Stalker into High Priest of Thune into Intangible Virtue + Blind Obedience one game), Jund Midrange, Jund Zombies, a Naya aggro deck, and Human Reanimator. I lost to the Jund Midrange deck, but beat the others. I drew into the top 8 in the sixth round since I had the best breakers and therefore could.

In the quarterfinals, I faced the human reanimator deck again. I didn't lose a game to him that day- I was either faster, had a timely Bonfire, or had enough hate. 

In the semifinals, I played against Esper. I concluded that he was playing a 75-card netdeck pretty quickly, which limited the possible cards he could be holding at any time. He put up a fight despite stumbling badly on mana. 

In the finals, I faced the Jund deck I lost to earlier. He had turn 3-4 Olivia against me every game I played against him, and the games seemed to come down to him having that and having it survive. When it didn't, I won, and that happened a few times. I sided out Thragtusk against him, which is probably wrong, but felt right- I liked all the other fives more in the matchup, and didn't want to overload on them.

I'd like to talk a bit about Dark Confidant and its potential within Esper Stoneblade. My inspiration for this thread comes from [this article](http://www.starcitygames.com/magic/legacy/25185-Matchup-Analysis-Esper-Stoneblade.html), which, as far as I have been able to find, is the only well-performing example of Stoneblade running Dark Confidant.

The biggest concern is obviously the high CMC of the deck (3x Jace, 3/4 FoW and 1 Batterskull). On the other hand, the deck runs a lot of library manipulation and a decent amount of lifegain, and a Dark Confidant sticking makes the already impressive card advantage that this deck generates become obscene.

I think the card shines the most in control matchups (which Ben Stepka agrees with), where the life-loss is not problematic and he can let you win the card advantage fight. The article above talks about how good it is in the mirror, but I think it's also very very good against Miracles. In terms of BUG, It does, of course die to Abrupt Decay, but against a heavy controlling BUG deck, he improves the chances of a threat sticking, so having both SFM and Bob should be good as well.

Even when without double strike though a Spark Trooper can put 12 points of life between you and your opponent. Worst case scenario it draws removal because there is no way someone is going to let the damage through if they have a choice. Also later game bringing back a few of these with Angel of Serenity can win you the game. I think this card is great in Naya midrange decks or fast decks, what do you guys think.

I've recently been having the itch to throw myself into Legacy; I enjoy the fast, diverse format way more than my forays into Modern, and it's largely what my normal playgroup plays.  I currently run Fish, I like Fish, I find that the combination of obnoxious tempo/control and creature beats fits my style very well.  It's also very well positioned in both metas I play in and tends to always do fairly well, if never finishing first.

So my next question would be, if I wanted to branch out, where do I start?  

I could easily put together a more fringe, cheaper deck like Dredge, Goblins, Elves!, Belcher, or Reanimator, but I'm seriously hesitating on dropping the cash.  With the exception of Elves! there isn't much in either deck that can be reused for another deck later down the road.  

Fish allowed me the luxury of Vial, Force of Will, Mutavault, and Wasteland; all major staples I've already slid into various other comp. and casual decks when the need arises.

That being said, I have no problem dropping the money if I feel doing so is a decent investment; I make a good income, quite a bit of it is disposable, and I enjoy both tournaments and casual play and spend a good deal of time doing both.

What do the Spikes of Reddit suggest; do I throw together Goblins or do I start piecing together one of the many ""Good Stuff"" Legacy decks like Jund or Delver (There was a mono-blue rogue tempo deck that placed a while back I thought looked interesting...) knowing that it's about double what I'd be paying for Goblins or Elves, but the vast majority of that cash would be sunk into cards that could find very good homes elsewhere (The duals, Jace, Goyf, Bob, etc)?

Or do you have any other Legacy deck suggestions that are fun and competitive?  I'm in the fishing for ideas phase right now, any input would be lovely.

This card is Grapeshot. Link to Grapeshot: http://gatherer.wizards.com/pages/card/details.aspx?name=grapeshot

This is the deck that runs Grapeshot Storm: http://forums.mtgsalvation.com/showthread.php?t=399245
There are three decks considered to be Tier 1 competitive decks in Pauper - Blue Delver - http://forums.mtgsalvation.com/showthread.php?t=390528) - IzzetPost - http://forums.mtgsalvation.com/showthread.php?t=379000 - and Storm. The reason for there being only 3 decks is that the two non-Storm decks are the only decks that can potentially deal with Grapeshot Storm via counterspells. Every other deck can only hope that the Storm player has a bad draw or screws up their math. At any time from turn 3 on, this deck can just go off and win. There are very few aggro decks that can win on their turn 2 or turn 3 in order to beat Storm - infect might be able to pull it off from time to time. Even monoblack control cannot normally force enough discard to prevent the Storm going off.

Why is Grapeshot the issue and not also Empty the Warrens + Goblin Bushwhacker? Because aggro and midrange decks can actually sideboard in cards to combat the mass hasted tokens storm. White has cards like Suture Priest and Holy Light, Black has cards like Echoing Decay and Wail of the Nim, Red has cards like Electrickery and Green... well Green needs to dip into another color if they want a board wipe.

So what does removing Grapeshot from the format do? It opens up the top tier of the format to decks that are not control decks, making the format a more diverse and interesting format to play. I personally love the Pauper format - there are a lot of cards to play around with and it’s a very competitive format with a dedicated base of players. However, unless you want to play storm or control mirrors, it can be a very frustrating experience (not that playing control mirrors is the most fun thing in the world either).

I also want to note that banning Grapeshot, while hurting the Storm deck significantly, does not make it irrelevant. It can still potentially win on Turn 3 with hasted goblins, and if they went first, the opponent will likely not have enough mana to board wipe them. I want to be clear I am not against combo decks in any way, but this combo is by itself shutting down the possibility of a great number of otherwise viable competitive decks.

The above reasons are why I feel like Grapeshot should be banned from the Pauper format. I would be interested to hear if people feel like I am wrong or just their thoughts on the subject.",,False,,t5_2utkz,False,,,True,t3_16mu6c,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/16mu6c/pauper_the_negative_effects_of_grapeshot_on/,

http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/who-let-the-zoo-out/

Feel free to ask me any questions about it and I'll explain some of the plays you can make.

**Why Naya?** It is no secret that Thragtusk + Restoration Angel is one of the most powerful combos in standard. Thragtusk has immense creature value as he is always a 2-for-1. I wanted to capitalize on the theme of creature value; if all of my creatures are a 2-for-1, my opponent will not be able to answer them all. After considering this direction, I looked for other creatures of immense value. Huntmaster was my first thought as a no-brainer value creature, and Zealous Conscripts was in-color too, which works wonderfully with Restoration Angel. White and Green are also low on decent removal. White has oblivion ring, green has prey upon and ulvenwald, so red filled up a weakness by providing burn spells.

**But awjustaguy, the manabase!** Yes, we don't have r/g and r/w EDIT: Shocklands (Thanks Torleep). This pushed me away from the idea of the deck as an aggressive deck. We clearly couldn't count on the land being there for our 1-3 drops. However, the solution is obvious and even synergistic - ramping. Mana ramping fixes the base and boosts us to midgame, which is where the deck shines naturally. Adding in 4x Avacyn's Pilgrim and 4x Farseek has eliminated nearly all mana screw. I can't remember any games in which I have lost due to a missing color. Evolving Wilds also makes a return in this deck, providing just the extra fixing necessary in emergency situations. We don't have many t1-t2 plays anyway so it hardly ever impedes my progress. A consequence of the color wedge, however, is that I do not recommend running any more than 2 colorless land. I have chosen to run Slayers' Stronghold as I think it is good in the meta, but Wolf Run and Township are perfectly viable options as well.

The point of this deck is simple; ramp to 4 land and abuse Restoration Angel and the most powerful 4-6 cc creatures in Standard.

A few notes: It's really important to know when to push and when to hold back with this deck. Just because you have a Thragtusk on the field and a restoration angel in your hand doesn't mean you should flicker him at the end of turn; it's best to save angel in response to enemy removal. Sideboarding can change this deck to be more aggressive for control matchups. With zealous conscripts, slayers' stronghold, restoration angel, and ulvenwald tracker, you are capable of massive board-state changes in just one turn; use it to your advantage, and you can almost always catch opponents off-guard. Cavern of Souls should probably be included but we have such a variety of creature types that it can strain the manabase; I'll leave that up to you.

Cute combos: Grabbing a creature with Conscripts and then flickering it with angel gives you a shiny new creature. Grabbing a creature with conscripts and making it fight enemy creatures with Tracker gives you board domination.

Here's my explanation on the match ups against current competitive and the sideboard options.
__________________________________________________________

***Against RDW:*** One of our easier matchups. Once you get to 5 mana they are mostly helpless. Watch out for Thundermaw Hellkite; you want to save your oblivion rings / tracker for this guy as you have no other way to kill it. Often times you can even outrace the RDW player; make sure to watch for this and know when you can be aggressive as they won't expect you to go on the offense and will often times keep being aggressive anyway.

***Cards you want to see in your hand:*** Thragtusk, Mizzium, Searing, Pillar, Huntmaster, Centaur Healer, Loxodon Smiter, Oblivion Ring, Restoration Angel

***Sideboard:*** -2 Zealous Conscripts, -2 Acidic Slime, -4 Farseek, -3 Avacyn's Pilgrim, +2 Mizzium Mortars, +3 Searing Spear, +3 Pillar of Flame, +3 Loxodon Smiter
__________________________________________________________

***Against U/W Flash:*** This is one of the harder matchups. This deck alone is a potential reason to put in 4 Cavern of Souls. You need to be as fast as possible against this deck because you have no way to answer Sphinx's Revelation. They won't be able to kill you very fast, but I've had many games where they resolve 2-3 Sphinx's Revelation and just kept answering threats until I finally ran out of steam. The way to win this matchup is to get out some threats before they get the game locked down, and force them to constantly use their mana to react as opposed to counter / revelation. The good news is that since almost all of your cards have ETB effects, azorius charm and unsummon become a little worse. Acidic Slime shuts down Moorland Haunt and can reduce their tempo if they don't get many lands. Huntmaster forces them to play cards when they don't want to; if you can get it out early do so. Ulvenwald Tracker is a star in this matchup- they often have few ways to remove him and his instant-speed removal bypasses counters. Severely reduces the effectiveness of Angel / Pike / Moorland.

***Cards to look for in your hand:*** Farseek, Avacyn's Pilgrim, Loxodon Smiter, Oblivion Ring, Acidic Slime, Zealous Conscripts, Huntmaster of the Fells, Ulvenwald Tracker

***Note on Counters:*** Since I don't have a way to draw more cards, I want to be careful which of my cards gets countered and which doesn't. Cards I absolutely don't want countered: Huntmaster, Armada Wurm, Thragtusk. Try to bait out their counters with removal or a more minor creature.

***Sideboard:*** -2 Mizzium Mortars, -1 Searing Spear, -2 Centaur Healer, +4 Loxodon Smiter, +1 Acidic Slime
__________________________________________________________

***Against Jund:*** Jund is like our older brother. We're both midrange decks, but we approach it in different ways. The good news is that our creature base is much better than theirs. The inclusion of Restoration Angel gives our creatures much more flexibility and power. They pack a lot of removal, but it's very easy to 2-for-1 them with Thragtusk / Resto Angel / Huntmaster / Armada Wurm. Make sure to save burn for Olivia. Ulvenwald Trackers can help you clear their board intelligently, and he will most likely eat up a removal spell if he doesn't, which is good for a one-drop. Just overwhelm them midgame with your superior forces and this will be a fairly easy matchup. Acidic Slime can take out wolf runs / Rakdos Keyrunes.

***Cards to look for in your hand:*** Armada Wurm, Thragtusk, Zealous Conscripts, Restoration Angel, Huntmaster of the Fells, Ulvenwald Tracker, Mizzium Mortars.

***Sideboard:*** -3 Centaur Healer, +2 Mizzium Mortars, +1 Searing Spear
__________________________________________________________

***Against Reanimator:*** This matchup isn't too bad. Your goal here is to do as much damage as you can before they get out their fatty, and Conscript it if you can. Building up an overwhelming board state works too, but watch out for Angel of Serenity. As a bonus, if you DO happen to get Angel'd, you get your ETB effects again. Matchup becomes much more favorable with RIP sideboarded in. NOTE: If you're playing the lingering souls/craterhoof reanimator combo, value Mizzium Mortars much more highly.

***Cards to look for in your hand:*** Thragtusk, Armada Wurm, Zealous Conscripts, Restoration Angel, Loxodon Smiter, Rest in Peace, Farseek

***Sideboard:*** -1 Searing Spear, -2 Mizzium Mortars, -3 Ulvenwald Trackers, -1 Centaur Healer, +4 Loxodon Smiter, +3 Rest in Peace
__________________________________________________________

***Against Bant Control:*** Every deck has a worst matchup, and this one is ours. It's not unwinnable, but they stop us from achieving an overwhelming board state with Supreme Verdict, and we don't have many ways to deal with Planeswalkers. Thragtusk and Conscripts will be your best bet here, as well as getting out some early Loxodon Smiters. Make sure to save Conscripts for their planeswalkers; you can usually finish them off with their - ability.

***Cards to look for in hand:*** Loxodon Smiter, Farseek, Zealous Conscripts, Thragtusk, Avacyn's Pilgrim.

***Sideboard:*** -2 Mizzium Mortars, -1 Searing Spear, -1 Ulvenwald Tracker, +4 Loxodon Smiter
__________________________________________________________

***Against B/R Zombies:*** Another one of our easier matchups. This is the same principal as RDW: Get to 5 mana, stabilize, win. Thragtusk is of course an all star, along with centaur healer and Ulvenwald Tracker. Just as with RDW, look for times when their offense has slowed considerably or isn't very strong, and become the aggressor, it catches them off guard as they aren't used to defending.

***Cards to look for in hand:*** Same as RDW.

***Sideboard:*** Same as RDW.
__________________________________________________________

***Against G/W Aggro:*** G/W Aggro is a favorable match up but you have a few things to watch out for. Sigarda is impossible for us to kill without two resto angels, so if you know they are playing her, make sure to try and get aggressive hands. Sublime Archangel is another problem, but not nearly so troublesome - just have a searing spear or an oblivion ring set aside. The important thing to remember in this matchup is A: The turn 3 silverblade paladin, and B: The turn 4/5 wolfir silverheart. If you are prepared to handle these threats (don't just count on them not getting them, they will most likely get them), then you will sail through this match up. If you aren't prepared, you will be caught with your pants down. Keep early burn in your hand to keep them out of the game until you can fight them on your own terms. Once you get an ulvenwald trackers and a beefy creature on the field, you can pretty much lock the game down, especially when you can remove their creature targeted by rancor to (finally) put that card in the graveyard.

***Cards to look for in hand:*** Mizzium Mortars, Searing Spear, Pillar of Flame, Thragtusk, Oblivion Ring, Restoration Angel

***Sideboard:*** -2 Acidic Slime, -3 Avacyn's Pilgrim, +2 mizzium mortars, +1 searing spear, +2 pillar of flame
__________________________________________________________

That's all for now. If you guys want advice on any other matchups I can give it.

***Conclusion:*** There is no doubt that this deck has some extreme power. Is it tier 1? After multiple first places in constructed tournaments, I think so. I'm sure some would disagree, but I encourage you to try it out for yourself. With Gruul and Boros coming just around the corner, this deck has no place to go but up. I'm convinced that this will be the deck to watch out for in the next few months.

He was playing his most recent version of U/W draw-go (sorry can't find the link) with a scatterbrained sideboard that had 1 griffin in it. The matchup was some sort of Junk Midrange that looked really powerful. We saw Sorin LOI, both Garruks, Thragtusk, Cavern, Lingering souls, probably Restoration Angel (though we didn't see it), mainboard Underworld connections, stuff like that. After going down game 1, Prosak decided to side in griffin for gigs and at the request of the stream because he figured there was no way he was winning.

Then game 2 happened and a turn 2 Rest in Peace was dropped. Prosak Thought scour'd himself, and low and behold there was griffin. It was then that he and the rest of the stream realized that that griffin was never ever leaving play as long as he had 4 mana. A 5 minute laughing bout was had by all and then griffin beats won the game.

Game 3, Adam leaves griffin in. No RIP but griffin still got there when Moorland haunt came online. When he got to enough mana, every time griffin died, he got a spirit and the griffin just came back. Chumping all day with haunt spirits plus griffin beats sealed the deal again and Prosak finished at an (what we thought was) unlikely 4-0 given that matchup of his draw-go deck versus T5-cavern-naming-beast-thragtusk-go deck.

The list is great overall, but it only really shines when it draws the powerful BG cards - Thoughtseize, Deathrite, Goyf, Bob, and Liliana. The rest of the deck just feels like a pile of cards surrounding this shell.


I've had problems with the four color version. Many draws want a Temple Garden because of Path to Exile. In addition, Path to Exile feels somewhat counter intuitive in a deck trying to deny resources. Lingering Souls is less needed in my meta but it's nice having access to fliers. Ajani has been fine, but only spectacular when he's accelerated on turn 3.


Lists online appear to be favoring Huntmaster and pure Jund colors rather than the white splash, so I'm going to try one of these lists for a few weeks to see what better suits my metagame. When scouring lists, I noticed Hadrianus37 had 4 Bonfire of the Damned in the full 75. He's been posting strong results online. Obviously the card is good against Affinity, Pod, and other random midrange decks, but I wonder how often it gets sided out.

But that said, I'm starting to wonder about Phyrexian Metamorph post m14.  As far as I can tell, the benefits pre m14 legendary changes:

* You possibly get an additional big beatstick on the field when you play it.

* You can remove any legendary creature on the battlefield (including hexproof/indestructible, etc), and it's destruction you can pod into.  It's an immensely important answer to be included in the deck.

Post M14 it becomes:

* You possibly get a large beatstick to work with.  This might be another copy of whatever legendary creature the enemy has that is giving you problems, BUT the enemy deck will be tuned to use it optimally, while yours will not.

The nature of the deck means that even including a 1 off of a card is extremely important, and a card has to be very, very good to make it into the deck.

It is seeing a ton of play, but only as a two-of in most Junk Aristocrats. The card does some pretty cool stuff, but is it enough to make it the whole point of a deck? 

In Junk, it pretty much is there to add a small boost to your battlefield, from creatures that have died. I think he would be key in a deck looking to give your creature a huge boost. Frank Lepore wrote an article about a deck a little more along these lines. [He showcased Bob Ferris's Jund Aggro deck, which took 7th at a TCG Open.](http://magic.tcgplayer.com/db/article.asp?ID=11255) The thing is, the deck only runs 1 Varolz in the entire 75, so you can't really call it a Varolz deck. Here is a decklist I tossed together that is more focused on using Varolz to win. [Scars and Striped](http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/scars-and-stripes/)

I originally just had it as Golgari, but Mulch did not keep it consistent. Instead, I added red and switched the Mulches for Faithless Looting. Because of what Mulch does, the deck tries to stay with mostly creatures, and hasn't deviated from that. I played around with Garruk Relentless and really like him. In a week, I'll be adding Doom Blades for sure.

The problem with being mainly creatures is that the deck becomes very aggro since it lacks the versatility non-creature spells add. The sucky part is that it is no where near fast enough to be aggro, so I attempted to tweak it to more midrange via creatures. Jarad for reach, Disciple for stabilizing, and Ulvenwald for removal. Since creatures get pretty big, I also wanted Rancor, but just skipped that in favor of creatures already with trample (or flying in the case of Nighthawk).

Has anyone tried building with this card? I feel like it has the potential to be an all-star until rotation, but it is still lacking something.

Hey, guys and gals. I played Punishing Waterfalls to a Top 8 finish through 8 rounds of Swiss. I'll break down the matches and would appreciate any feedback about the deck/SB. 

Round 1 - Punishing Jund - Game 1: He started Grove into Deathrite and I responded with Grove into Bolt. The next turn he played Bob which I hit with a Fire. He passed after missing a land drop and I resolved a Library then Wasted him. The next turn he wasted me. It became very grindy until Library allowed me to pull ahead with Cascade. Game 2: Turn 1 I got Thoughtseized with a Hymn turn 2 and Lily Turn 3. Couldn't do much, especially with Bloodbraid into Goyf the following turn. Game 3: I started with Deathrite and so did he. I was able to turn 2 Shardless into Punishing to burn his. Following turn I Bloodbraid into Bolt and he can't recover. SB In: 2 Grim Lavamancer, Maelstrom Pulse, Pithing Needle SB Out: 4 Force of Will (1-0)

Round 2 - Maverick (Jack Wang) - Game 1: All I saw this game was 2 Noble Heirarch. I started by destroying both with burn spells, followed by a bunch of card advantage with Cascade. Game 2: This game was much more difficult. He was able to path all 3 Goyfs I played. I was able to tick him down to 8 until he resolved a KotR. He dropped a Sword of Feast and Famine with what would've been lethal due to not have lethal blockers, but I was able to Brainstorm into my 3rd Bolt to win the game. SB In: 2 Grim Lavamancer, Pithing Needle, Surgical Extraction SB Out: 4 Force of Will (2-0)

Round 3 - Landstall - Game 1: I wasn't very sure what I was going against as I'm relatively new to Legacy and the only card he cast was Crucible of Worlds. I was able to land a Turn 2 Domri Rade and ultimate him uninterrupted. Game 2: Again, he didn't land anything until I had 4 creatures out and it was a Humility. At that point I just swung with them all to drop him into double Bolt range. He didn't hit any board wipe and I won with a bunch of 1/1's. SB In: 2 Ancient Grudge, Maelstrom Pulse SB Out: 3 Punishing Fire (3-0)

Round 4 - RUG Delver (Chris Pikula) - Game 1 - I saw the absolute worst things as an opponent of this deck. He was on the play and Stifled my first fetch. I had a Grove of Burnwillows into Deathrite. He followed up with Forked Bolt into Wasteland. After he resolved double Mongoose and Goyf it was more than over. Game 2 - I tried to Mull into a hand that was too vulnerable, but at 5 I was left with just a dual which didn't last too long and that was pretty much it. SB In: 2 Grim Lavamancer, Pithing Needle SB Out: Domri Rade, Sylvan Library, BBE (3-1)

Round 5 - RUG Delver (Featured but off camera) - Game 1: He only hit one land but it was pretty awesome in the Delver point of view. He burned me down to 1 as I established a small board presence and he luckily wasn't able to hit anything as I ran into BBE and cascaded away. Game 2: Same old stuff with this deck. Played a fetch and passed and I did the same. He played a Dual and dropped a Mongoose. I had to try and crack the fetch but a Stifle was waiting in the wings. I crushed very hard. Game 3: I got to play the Delver game myself with a 5 land opening land. I was able to crack for an island and suspend Visions. His turn was a Ponder which I was very happy with. I Wasted him and passed. I was able to Waste every land he played and grow my board presence with Cascade. SB In: 2 Grim Lavamancer, Pithing Needle SB Out: Domri Rade, Sylvan Library, BBE (4-1)

Round 6 - 4c Loam (Hoogland's list) - Game 1: He went land, Mox, Wish into Loam. I land a Deathrite and before I know it I get Wasted and he Loamed. I got crushed pretty hard from that point forth. My SB is pretty strong for the match, but him mulling to 5 was a pretty big help. I made myself Waste-proof and got to Shardless turn 2 and BBE turn 3. Game 3 he started by going to 6 and with a cycle land tapped, I then suspended a Visions turn 1. He was only able to drop Mox and Wish for a Loam. I played a land and Grudged his Mox. At the end of his draw step I Surgically Extracted his Wasteland that he pitched with Mox. He actually drew one that turn so he had no lands in hand and no Wastelands. The win was pretty easy after that. SB In: 2 Ancient Grudge, 3 Surgical Extraction, Pithing Needle SB Out: 3 Punishing Fire, Misdirection, Domri Rade, Sylvan Library (5-1)

Game 7 - Countertop - Game 1: These decks go a little silly against Cascade with all the triggers. Game 1 I was able to keep bashing in enough threats through the top thanks to Cascade. Game 2 I got crushed pretty badly, and all due to an  Angel token. I didn't realize until then how little I can do about that flying 4/4. Game 3 was a repeat of game 1 where I just came out storming and put him down to 3 before he knew it. He was able to land a Moat which was pretty brutal until I hit a Bolt that he could nothing about. SB In: Pithing Needle, Notion Thief, Maelstrom Pulse SB Out: 3 Punishing Fire (6-1)

Game 8 - I was the 4th seed, sitting in the highest spot with 18 points. I agreed to draw without reading the standings properly. Turns out because of the number of people with 18 points, I needed the lowest 18 point person who got paired down to lose. I was lucky enough to have Max Tietze win with Golbins to lock me in at 6-1-1.

Top 8 - Reanimator - So this was the match some of you might have seen. I'm sorry that I couldn't show how the deck worked -_- Game 1 he was on the play, dropped land and passed. I played Deathrite on my turn and passed. He played Entomb on end step which I Forced. He was able to pitch Griselbrand on his turn and Animate it immediately. I scooped immediately knowing I was done. SB I threw in my 3 Surgical and 1 Angel of Despair. I had to Mull to 6 thanks to no lands, but drew almost a perfect hand. I was able to get 2 Surgicals and my Angel of Despair. He went off with Show and Tell this game, but in case you didn't know Angel of Despair &gt; Elesh Norn. On to game 3. I had to Mull again and didn't get anything better. I had a FoW and was hoping to hit a blue card. This game was my Goyf racing his Griselbrand, which was actually way closer than many people thought it's be due to his liberal use of Griselbrand. 

So my first tournament with more than 14 people using that deck and overall I was very impressed with it. Thanks for reading and sorry if this wasn't as informative as it could be. I have to get better with notes as I'm playing.

1372042106.0,16,self.spikes,1gy139,[Standard] Madcap Skills vs. Firefist Striker vs. Lightning Mauler in RG Aggro [Discussion],20,4,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/1gy139/standard_madcap_skills_vs_firefist_striker_vs/,"The most recent RG Aggro list to [Top 8 at SCG](http://www.mtgtop8.com/event?e=5132&amp;d=229589) had 4 Mainboard Madcap Skills, in place of the ever popular Firefist Striker.

This got me thinking, especially after playtesting said list and then sleeving it up for FNM, which 2 CMC card helps us accomplish doing what this deck wants to do; shell out 20 Damage as quickly as possible. 

Now, I know the idea of getting 2-for-1'd more often with Madcap skills may have people second guessing running a playset Mainboard, but, I think it may be the way to go. It's not much different than running Firefist Striker, honestly, allowing your suited up creature to get through while your others are being blocked, or, your other creatures are getting through while you are making your opponent block a 5/2 Stromkirk, losing 2 creatures in the process most of the time.

The possibility of going turn 1 Noble, into BTE, BTE, Madcap on Noble is so explosive. As you are hitting for 4 on your first swing. And, on the play or on the draw, that 4 damage is getting through regardless, or they are losing 2 creatures. As I said, this leaves us open for 2-for-1's, but, if we were running Firefist, the targeted removal would simply go to him first anyways, not allowing our creatures to get through.

And if you can happen to land a Madcap on Reckoner, you can first strike your way through just about any blocks, or they just take 6.

Now, something else I've been considered is this: Moving Lightning Mauler back to the Mainboard in some number, along with Madcap Skills. I know this puts us on the Glass Cannon plan, as I'm likely choosing to run Mauler over removal or Ghor Clan in some combination. Intial thoughts were: +3 Mauler, -1 Rampager -2 Searing Spear. This makes us quicker, but less resilient. 

I've even considered a straight creature build: -4 Pillar -4 Searing Spear, +4 Firefist Striker +4 Lightning Mauler (With Madcap main) 

But, I fear this just makes for a potentially worse Naya Blitz..but with no testing done on this build yet, it's all speculation. 

So, what are your thoughts? Are there any other options I'm potentially overlooking?

Now onto the report!

Round 1: Jund run by Greg Smith

Game one I start off with a shaky that consisted of a few lands, a couple three drops along with a Ghor Clan and Boros Charm.  We pass turns back and forth until I start landing my Reckoners and Smiters while he hits his Huntmasters and Thragtusks.  I am able to whittle his life total to about 18 which is when I go for the kill.  All he has on the field is a Thragtusk while I have two Smiters and a Reckoner.  I swing in with the team and he blocks the Smiter.  I proceed to Ghor-Clan the  unblocked Smiter and then give it double strike resulting in 19 points of damage between the Smiter and Reckoner.  Game two he draws a perfect combination removal and creatures in order to shut me off.  Game three he mulls to 6 while I keep an experiment one, strangle root hand and proceed to mow him down before he can land a thragtusk.

1-0

Sided in 3 skullcracks and 1 mizzium, took out 2 rancors and 2 boros charms.

Round 2: UWR Control run by Tyler Mollenkopf

Game one he has got the pillar of flame snapcaster hand which proceeds to shut down my deck and ends up finishing it with an uncontested Aetherling.  Game two I am able to keep landing threats faster than he can take them out, without having a chance to stabilize with either Warleaders Helix nor Sphinx's Revelations. Game three was won by drawing 3 boros charms over the course of the game as well as a timely Skullcrack in response to a Helix.

2-0

Sided in 2 Boros Charms and 3 Skullcracks while taking out 2 rancors and 3 Searing Spears.

Round 3 UWR Control run by Edward Fox

Edwards deck seemed a bit wonky, it was in fact UWR Control but I had absolutely no trouble dealing with it.  Both games I kept reasonable hands and starting draining his life total with a supply of creatures, however we both ended up topdecking for 5 turns straight late game and I was still able to pull it off.  

3-0

Round 4: Esper Control run by my buddy Raymond Perez Jr.

I played against Raymond at a 5k the weekend before when he was on Grixis and I was on just RG.  I was able to pull of the win but I knew he was an insanely good player.  I lost both games because he was able to ration of his removal consisting of warped physique and Far//Away over the course of the game and wasn't afraid to one for one his supreme verdicts. I can't remember what he played that killed me but I know it wasn't Obzedat or Blood Baron of Vizkopa.

3-1

I sided in 2 boros charms as well as 3 skull cracks, taking out double rancor and 3 searing spears.

Round 5-7 Bant Hexproof run by William Dickey, Jeff Levine and Christian Holbrook.

I had yet to have played against Bant Hexproof with this deck so I was nervous playing the first one.  Then I realized that this deck stomps Hexproof.  It can race just as fast as long as they don't get an unflinching courage online.  The key cards in this matchup is being able to swing and do the Ghor-clan/Boros Charm combo to blow them out of the water.  I lumped them all together because the games played out the same way.  All went to game 3, me being on the play twice, on the draw once and it all came down to trying to deal 15 points of damage in one swing and having them dead by turn 4. 

6-1 in top 8!

Top 8: Bant Hexproof yet again.

Top 4: Also Bant Hexproof!

I wish I could write about these matchups but they all ran the same way, we both play early guys, swing at each other and see who has either more ghor clans or enchantments.  

I ended up splitting Top 2 with a guy running 4 color reanimator however we played it out for the plaque.  

Game one I had a steady stream of creatures while he was trying to hit some big stuff in his yard.  Turn 6 I cast my voice of resurgence and have enough mana to cast Reckoner as well, however I hold it up just in case he Angels next turn.  He angels next turn.  This leaves me with a reckoner that has double rancor on the turn afterwards allowing me to push through the final 6 points of damage.  Game two, he had to mull a bunch so it was a steamroll.


All in all I am very happy with how well this deck did.  Over the course of the weekend it went 13-5 in matches which is awesome for a first run.

Some cards just have potential, but despite being aggressively costed and effective at their role they just aren't seeing play.  Maybe the card doesn't have a deck to call home yet, maybe there's a strictly-better version of the card available, or maybe the meta is just currently too punishing against it.  Whatever the reason, I think it's important to be aware of and remember these cards when deck tuning.  You never know when a new set or ban could suddenly spring them into relevance.  

Let's share some cards that you think could have potential in the future.

Here are a few of mine, in no particular order:

1) **Blade Splicer** - This thing was a beating in standard, is resilient versus Liliana's sac effect, could fit in nicely in pod, and loves flicker effects.  I think it saw a bit of play in a modern UW Caw-Blade variant, but otherwise fell off the map pretty quickly.

http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=233068

2) **Devout Lightcaster** - Triple white means this would need a very particular deck to work, but it's hard to argue with a pro-black exile effect on legs that straight up removes Liliana, Bob, Olivia, Deathrite, etc.  Most likely sideboard hate, but I like this card a lot.

http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=191374

3) **Paladin en-Vec** - Auriok Champion has started seeing some play because its pro-red / pro-black makes it a very pesky creature to deal with.  The Paladin loses the life text from Champion, but is a slightly larger threat.  Again, would need a white-weenie type deck to work.

http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=129668

4) **Sedraxis Specter** - Okay this one is a bit pie in the sky, I'll admit, but as someone who loves Grixis, I think this guy would be very wicked in a Grixis tempo shell, if that ever gets the cards to become a thing.

http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=174838

5) **Akuta, Born of Ash** and **Nether Traitor** - Now really use your imagination here.  These guys are actually pretty sick at being recurring threats and every once and a while that's exactly what a pseudo-dredge or pox deck wants.

I would like to stay with U/W/x  as a deck and I feel like it can adapt to the format fairly well. Ætherling has been an addition in some UWR decks and I like this and have yet to try it but 2 lists have struck my attention.

**The New and not so new Decks**

[UW Flash/Control](http://www.mtgtop8.com/event?e=4941&amp;d=228539)

This deck recently took 4th in a MTGO Premier event and I was surprised to see it there. With counters, Revelation, Creatures with Pike and more tempo stuff This deck looks like it could be good with some more tuning.

[UWR Reckoner/Aurelia](http://www.mtgtop8.com/event?e=4932)

1st place in premier. This deck uses both Aurelia and Reckoner where before it was one or the other. The deck can handle aggro better with reckoner and still end games with Aurelia. There are a lot of burn spells they have avalible that I think can be done better Warleader's Helix comes to mind. But the deck also uses Ral Zarek as a 2 of I like him here he acts as burn to get rid of opposing creatures and can ramp you into an Aurelia quicker. I think the board and some of the burn can be worked on but I like where this deck is going.

I like the creature base of UWR with:

* 2 Aurelia
* 3 Boros Reckoner
* 3 Restoration Angel
* 3 Snapcaster Mage
* 2 Augur of Bolas(Deputy could be good here also.)

I think this base could work well as an answer to aggro and be good against the Midrage decks like how the Aurelia list is.

I've been pondering an idea of a Midrange UWR deck that uses Lavina and other UWR staple creatures with draw spells burn and other cards but haven't been able to finalize a list. I feel like UWR with a good board presence could be good instead of Flash. Also Aurelia's Fury and Legion's Initiative

**Some Cards in Mind**

I've been thinking of some cards to add to UWR are:

* Aurelia's Fury
* Renounce The Guilds
* Legion's Initiative
* Lavinia of The Tenth
* Warleader's Helix
* Turn // Burn
* Ætherling
* Ral Zarek
* Niv-Mizzet, Dracogenius

I think some of these could find a home in UWR in a Midrage kind of deck With Lavinia tapping down creatures and letting you swing in for more damage then keeping things tapped down with Aurelia's fury letting them play no spells on there turn and with counters and burn to deal with things creatures that we don't want to see.

1368352056.0,16,self.spikes,1e6dom,[Legacy] Belching for Beginners (it's that guy again) ...,21,5,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/1e6dom/legacy_belching_for_beginners_its_that_guy_again/,"Ahoy Spikes ... 

Just wanted to say thanks for your help with the Lion's Eye Diamond questions, and of course prod you for more information. 

I'm working with a few different Belcher builds, but I've been favoring [this](http://www.eternal-central.com/?p=2807) one due to what the author mentions as a ""turn-one win percentage in the eighties."" 

But after solitairing hundreds of hands on this deck online, I'm just not seeing how that's possible. I've gotten better in the process of solitairing, realizing that the author's version of a ""turn-one win"" might be storming up 12 goblins or more. 

I think the weak link is the lack of win coins. This deck's just running four belchers and four empty the warrens. Most Belchers run burning wish, but I'd need seething song for that as well. I actually like seething song for the deck; since you've got probes and any real counter is generally going to bone your game anyway, even if SS is a counter magnet. Plus a burning wish into a recross is basically an opportunity to stack the deck.

I've got the cards and the patience for that, I just don't want to get in too far over my head as a beginner. This build has a ""Red Deck Wins"" sort of simplicity that appeals to me, but trading off to a more traditional belcher with the cards mentioned above (or preferably a recross-based stacking belcher) would be preferable to me if it's more practical. I have more fun winning than anything else.

The link to the build on tappedout is below if you'd like to solitaire a few hands or take a look. As always any feedback is massively appreciated:

I've decided on a heavy control shell with emphasis on sweepers and removal, with planeswalker backup and singleton AEtherling and Assemble the Legions for finishers. I'm trying to put on the finishing tweaks before a tournament this Saturday. [Here's the list.](http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/uwr-control-09-05-13-3/)
  
There's a few choices I've made that I should go over:
  
* AEtherling as a finisher over Aurelia. This card's been under a lot of dispute, but I think he works well in my removal-heavy shell as an inevitable win condition. The deck is very slow and grindy, and he works better than Aurelia in that sense.
* No Boros Reckoners in the 75. I really do like Reckoner, he hoses aggro completely, but the issue is that there's so much hate against him, and he makes my board wipes much trickier to cast. Also, I don't have the room to run things that combo well with Reckoner like Boros Charm (infinite life combo) and Harvest Pyre.
* Jace, Memory Adept. Jace is in the mainboard as a 1-cheaper Staff of Nin, and occasionally an alternate win condition. I like the additional draw power he provides, and the mill 10 is an occasional game breaker.
* Tamiyo, the Moon Sage. People keep telling me to sideboard her, but to be honest, I don't know what to bring her in aganist. She seems pretty good against every matchup (except that she's too slow to handle aggro), so I thought she might be good in the mainboard.
* Ral Zarek. I've been testing him and I've liked him so far. At worst, he kills a threat and soaks a hit for me, at best, he stays online and keeps giving me tempo advantage. I would like to run two of him, but the list is tight, and I'm not sure where I could fit him in.
* 2 Warleader's Helix. Seems strong, an answer to Sire, Aurelia, Restos, and a strong aggro dampener with the lifegain.
* 2 Turn // Burn. I think this is the right number, 3 is too many considering I actually do want to Fuse it most of the time. There's a third in the board though.
* No Pillars mainboard. I am worried about Voice and/or Aristocrats, but I have some other stuff to help me with that (Terminus, Turn, Aurelia's Fury).
* Aurelia's Fury. I've been testing with 2 Furies mainboard, and it's been really strong against all the midrange decks (and occasionally aggro decks). However, seeing as how the list is so tight already, I cut it to 1 main 1 side. It costed too much mana anyway.
  
Anyway, thoughts? I really want UWR Control to work, and I think Turn // Burn, Warleader's Helix, and AEtherling were great gains for the deck. I'm really worried about the Jund matchup and Hexproof decks, they just get so much value out so quickly.",,False,,t5_2utkz,1368152158.0,,,True,t3_1e1kqn,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/1e1kqn/standard_uwr_control_in_postdgm_meta/,

This is my first report so I guess I'll just jump right into it!

**Round 1** - Andy with R/B Goblins

Game 1 - My opponent keeps a slow hand on the play (no lacky) and just gets picked apart by thought seizes and goyfs

Game 2 - My opponent opens up with an Aether Vial on the play into 3 goblin lackys on turn 2 vs my Death rite shaman into turn 2 Engineered Plague. The game ends about 7 turns later with myself having 10 more permanents in play and 3 more cards in hand.

1-0

**Round 2** - Scott with Merfolk

Game 1 - my opponent floods out a little and lilliana is able to close the game out with some goyfs for pressure

Game 2 - we both mulligan down to 5 and my hand of bob, shaman, library, delta, underground sea beats his 1 island, 3 lord, Spellskite opener

2-0

**Round 3** - David with Sneak and Show

Game 1 - I recognize my opponent from the legacy challenge the night before and know hes on Sneak and Show and mulligan accordingly. Naturally this means I go down to 4. The game ends several turns later with him dead on board peeling a spaghetti monster for the win.

Game 2 - Once again I mulligan down to 5 with him keeping 7. This was an interesting game that ended with me sacrificing 6 permanents and exiling one of my creatures sacrificed with a Deathrite shaman to go to 16 before getting hit for 15. I put him on not having another creature and cast dimir charm to look at the top of his library which was met with a force of will and then a concession after he draws a fetch land starring down a lethal goyf.

Game 3 - I keep a 6 card hand with a little disruption and get blown out by the turn 2 show and tell with force back up.

2-1

**Round 4** - Matt with Jund

Game 1 - I get a little bit flooded and scoop to my opponent after he only sees daze, brainstorm, and blue fetches hopeing he misboards

Game 2 - My wish comes true after all his removal is boarded out and my goyf is met with a look of suprise. The dream is short lived how ever by having 4 spells and 12 lands by the end of the game. 

2-2

**Round 5** - Andy with Sneak and Show

Game 1 - Andy goes for the blind turn 1 on the play and I promptly scoop em up and go to side boarding

Games 2 and 3 where both pretty one sided as he just couldn't recover from Bob feeding me cards and promptly shredding his hand.

3-2

**Round 6** - Jeremy with Oops all spells 

Game 1 - My opponent is on the play and has the turn 1 so we go to side boarding

Game 2 - I have a turn 1 thought seize followed up by a daze and a goyf and my opponent concedes

Game 3 - My opponent keeps a speculative hand with 3 cyclers on the play and misses the turn 1. His hand gets picked apart and he is unable to recover.

4-2

**Round 7** - Sam Black with B/W Humans

I had heard rumors throughout the day that Sam had a spicy new brew he was playing but that was about all I knew going into game 1.

Game 1 - I'm on the play with a bob and few wastelands and land a Jace vs his empty board. Sam sees the writing on the wall and scoops em up.

Game 2 - We have a very strange game that eventually ends with Sam winning. After seeing some more of his deck I go back to my sideboard and bring in my Engineered Plagues.

Game 3 - I open up on the play with a Thoughtseize and take Sam's only non-human card in hand (Stoneforge mystic) and promptly slam an E Plague on turn 3 which gets a concession. 

5-2

**Round 8** - Michael with Merfolk

Much like Show and tell Merfolk was everywhere this past weekend. I don't remember the last time I hit it twice in the swiss but it has proven to be a decent match up so I didn't complain.

Game 1 - I keep a removal light hand in the dark and get run over.

Game 2 - I use my life as a resource and get my opponent to over extend a little bit then clean up the board with an EE on 2 and he is unable to recover.

Game 3 - We have a VERY grindy game 3 which easily went 20 turns. My opponent's inexperience with the deck started showing as we entered the late game and I was able to pull it out at 1 life. 

6-2

**Round 9** - Jason with Sneak and Show

Game 1 - My turn 1 Thoughtseize gets misdirected and I immediately know my opponent is on Show and Tell. After beating the deck twice in the Legacy challenge and once before (nearly twice) in the swiss I feel very confidant (buh dum tiss) going into this round. I squeak out game 1 with the help of Mr. Maher and some Thoughtseizes.

Game 2 - My opener had some disruption but a mediocre clock so my opponent was able to recover and come back for the win. 

Game 3 - My opponent mulligans to 5 on the draw and isn't able to recover from a Thoughtseize taking his only action and a hymn and some pressure to follow it up.

In Draft on the other hand I firmly believe having a good curve, especially if you want to be aggressive is the #1 factor in how your deck will finish in the draft. 

So it's a fast format, what does that mean for you? Odds are good that you aren't pick quality 2 and 3 drops nearly high enough unless they are absolute slam picks like Guildmages or Truefire Paladin. Cards like Shambleshark, Daring Skyjek, Crocanura, Kingpin's Pet, Basilica Screecher are the backbones of decks in this format and yet people consistently pick higher cost creatures / removal over them. 

While I understand the removal preference for the guilds with black, since they really need a certain number of removal spells to come out ahead, I'm lost by Gruul and Boros snapping at the bit to get stuff. Good bloodrush cards are essentially removal and flood-protection in Gruul and Boros only really has two removal spells of note anyway. 

So there's my question to you guys, do you guys believe curve is the most important thing in GTC? Or is it still the traditional role of either the critical mass of removal or bombs?

I've finally gotten around to adding flair. You can now:

1) Edit your own user flair! Please keep it SFW and if without the word 'mod' or 'moderator' or any variation of those. If your flair isn't appropriate we will ask you to change it and then if you do not further action will be needed. Of course, being a group of mature magic players, I expect I will not need to deal with any of those issues. 

2) assign link flair! We have around 12 options ranging from standard to MTGO to discussion. **You can now flair up a post instead of tagging it in the tite!** MSG me or the mods if you feel like a specific option is missing. 

Have fun, and flair responsibly!

1361214030.0,15,self.spikes,18rkeo,[Standard] Let's talk Naya Humans (Tweaks and Dealing w/ Control),19,4,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/18rkeo/standard_lets_talk_naya_humans_tweaks_and_dealing/,"Hey all,

So Naya Humans is my deck. I like the pace, toolkit, and I'm a sucker for tribal aggro. I've piloted it several times to exclusively 4-0/3-1 finishes but some games have been closer than I want them to be so I'm looking for tweaks.

Also, the recent ascension of Esper control and its 6 sweepers has been a problem (and is the cause of all of my x-1 finishes). So I want to chat about potential tweaks/answers/strategies.

First, my list:

4 Avacyn's Pilgrim

4 Champion of the Parish

3 Frontline Medic

3 Huntmaster of the Fells

4 Mayor of Avabruck

3 Nearheath Pilgrim

3 Restoration Angel

4 Silverblade Paladin

3 Thalia, Guardian of Thraben

3 Forest

1 Plains

4 Cavern of Souls

3 Clifftop Retreat

2 Kessig Wolf Run

3 Rootbound Crag

1 Sacred Foundry

2 Stomping Ground

4 Temple Garden

3 Searing Spear

3 Selesnya Charm

SB: 2 Centaur Healer

SB: 1 Fiend Hunter

SB: 1 Zealous Conscripts

SB: 2 Oblivion Ring

SB: 2 Rest in Peace

SB: 2 Boros Charm

SB: 1 Ray of Revelation

SB: 2 Garruk Relentless

SB: 2 Pillar of Flame


---------

Initial thoughts on the list:

1. Land count is low. It's usually not a problem but I've had hairy situations arise where I want more lands and am just not drawing them. I'd like to raise the land count by at least one (Gavony Township probably), maybe two. I know that mana dorks help but that brings me to my next point...

2. I'm not a huge fan of Avacyn's Pilgrim. There are very few three drops I want to ramp into on turn 2 (Medic/Paladin and neither is mandatory). I want a one drop that applies pressure, like Champion. Pilgrim is rarely ever going to be more than a 2/2 with a Mayor so it always leaves me feeling ""meh"" when I see it or top deck it (especially without any X spells for late game).

3. Potential replacements are really only one: Experiment One. He's a human, gets bigger, and has the ability to potentially survive sweepers. Mayors make him bigger and he could get as big as a 4/4 without the anthem (assuming you can get a huntmaster to flip). Also, he would synergize with the addition of a Township. The cons are obvious - we need to up mana sources and he's a mediocre to poor late game top deck. He also competes with the Champ for the one drop spot (though he probably beats champ since champ triggers off ANY human, whereas Experiment only triggers off bigger humans). 

4. Nearthearth Pilgrim is good but only in an aggro heavy format. Slower formats make him mediocre to bad and I think I'd dump him to the sideboard to up my land count and add more action to the main deck. Meta-dependent call.

5. Selesnya Charm isn't great in a slower format. The things it hits in G1 rarely merits its place in the MD. I think it's a better board card. Evasion is given by wolf run and 9/10 I'd rather top deck a spear or a boros charm. 


So, with those thoughts, I'm looking for suggestions on how to better deal with sweepers and Esper control. The best suggestions I've had are A) boros charms main deck (I think running a 2/1 split with Selesnya Charm or replacing it altogether) and B) Gideon. Gideon isn't a phenomenal answer since Esper can still make you sac him via an edict but he's a much tougher to answer threat. I think 2 in the board instead of the pillars might be a good call.

Finally, I can always run the super secret tech of an Elixir of Immortality but that only buys time. If they're chaining back to back sphinxes, Elixir isn't going to save you at that point in the game. 

Another option for ramping up the clock is replacing Neartheath w/ Burning Tree Emissary - which isn't a bad idea save for the fact that its ability isn't terribly relevant in a white heavy deck unless you play her T4 to get her and a huntmaster.

I think the changes I'd make would be as follows:

-2 Avacyn's Pilgrim

-3 Nearheath Pilgrim

-2 Selesnya Charm

+4 Experiment One

+2 Boros Charm

+1 Gavony Township

So I'm trying to decide what deck to bring to GP AC. I last played a competitive tourny at SCG Baltimore with UW Flash and got completely smoked. It was a terrible meta call (needed red for removal) and an overall bad results day but one that gave me lots of good experience.

Now, I'm tweaking and attempting to determine what deck to play come GP AC. My two choices are more or less:

1. UWR Control (Flash)
2. Angel Reanimator (GP Nagoya winner)

My question to you is what do you think the meta will look like? I think Angel Reanimator has a great matchup against almost everything - the real question is dealing with hate. Rest in Peace and Grafdigger's Cage can wreck that deck very effectively games 2 and 3 in a way Ray of Revelation may be insufficient to deal with.

I'm comfortable with UWR control but I feel like I still don't have a fantastic matchup against aggro, be it RB or GW/UW. I feel like the deck is extremely draw dependent and slow and the lack of great counters makes every game a toss-up of top-decking/drawing the right answers. I understand that's how control generally works but it just seems defacto worse than Bant for that purpose (and I don't really have the cards to play Bant). I'm sure there are some tweaks I can make to UWR but, while its the deck I'm most comfortable with, I have a creeping hunch that it will be a bad meta call due to its recent success (everyone will be packing hate) and its luck-of-the-draw matchups v. hyper aggressive decks.

I love playing Angel combo and am leaning towards running it but I'm really worried about hate. Do you think many people will be packing GY hate? I assume it will be on people's minds due to its success at GP Nagoya. The general existence of Frites decks all but guarantees hate and the deck doesn't auto-lose to hate but the matchups becomes much much rougher.

Long story short - what do you think the GP-AC meta will be and which deck (UWR Flash or Angel Combo) will be the better meta call?

Thanks!

I have been playing UWR for quite sometime now and still haven't gotten a good understanding of Modern as a format. So I think it is a good time to make that push and really get into the format on MTGO. I have all the cards for UWR Contorl and Midrange. UWR is a top deck in the format and there are many choices in these colors. Recently the main creatures of the midrange have shifted dropping Geist in favor of a more controlling card package. With so many people jumping onto UWR after Shahar's recent Victory at the 2013 World Championship I think it is a good time to talk about the recent changes and what we can do with the deck itself and some card choices I can get into later.

**The Decks**

[Shahar Shenhar's winning list from Worlds](http://www.mtgtop8.com/event?e=5388&amp;d=231110)

I enjoyed watching him play this deck throughout the tournament especially in the top 4 and the finals. I like the solo Ajani and I like the creature package but I'm wondering why has Geist of Saint Traft been removed from Midranges 75? This seems like a Flash deck more than a midrange.

[Sammy Tukeman's 2nd place decklist from GP San Diego](http://www.mtgtop8.com/event?e=4573&amp;d=226496)

This is the deck I purchased as soon as I saw it. I love control and I love the colors of UWR, There really wasn't a control deck out there until this one and I was eager to play it. Some changes have been made to the deck itself like dropping a Ajani Vengeant for a Gideon Jura.

[Orie Guo 5/8 Decklist](http://www.mtgtop8.com/event?e=4927&amp;d=228454)

I didn't get a chance to see this tournament but he placed fairly well and still had Geist in the 75. With some interesting additions like Grim Lavamancer and Mana Tithe and no Restoration Angels. This seemed to be more of a tempo deck than a Midrange deck but really didn't catch on.

[The Control Variant at Worlds](http://www.mtgtop8.com/event?e=5388&amp;d=231112)

When I watched Ben Stark and Shahar Shenhar play in the top 4 I thought Stark was favored but was rooting for Shenhar. This is different from Sammy's list it uses 4 Snapcaster Mages and Drops Ajani Vengeant for a solo Gideon Jura. Why Hallowed Burial over Terminus?

**Card Choices**

*Creatures*

* Geist of Saint Traft - at the three drop it can really close games out quickly and has been a staple of the deck for quite sometime now.
* Snapcaster Mage - An auto include in most blue decks since he is all utility.
* Restoration Angel - A powerful 4 drop that has a lot of favorable blocks in the format and can swing well also has flash
* Vendilion Clique - Flashes in and removes combo pieces and other cards we can't deal with from their hands.
* Thundermaw Hellkite - Hasty 5 drop beater that kills Souls and taps fliers excellent for racing.
* Aven Mindcensor - Hate card with flash can shut down Pod and fetch lands.
* Baneslayer Angel - Another 5 drop beater that is great at closing out games.
* Batterskull - Not techniaclly a creature but is another great 5 drop finisher.
* Grim Lavamancer - Kind of bad with snapcaster but can remove cards like fetches for extra damage.
* Lightning Angel - 4 drop with haste and evasion, Restoration Angel is better in this spot I feel.
* Teferi, Mage of Zhalfir - Locks out control players from counter magic and is able to flash in.

*Counter Magic*

* Cryptic Command - 4 Mana do whatever you want sounds good.
* Mana Leak - Great in the beginning of the game but loses a lot of power after that.
* Spell Snare - Counters the most important cards in the format.
* Remand - Tempo Counter that has some tricks.
* Izzet Charm - Each mode is over costed but the variety is what makes this a good card.
* Counterflux - Usually in the side for Control match ups and stops storm.
* Negate - a good counterspell.
* Dispel - 1 mana counter for instants.
* Spell Pierce - 1 mana counter that is alike Mana Leak and is a mode in Izzet Charm.
* Mana Tithe - White Counter that can catch people off guard.

*Burn/Removal*

* Lightning Helix - 2 Mana 6 life swing is good
* Lightning Bolt - The Main burn of this deck 1 mana 3 damage can do a lot.
* Electrolyze - Card advantage and can 2 for 1 pesky x/1's in the format.
* Path To Exile - Path to Exile

*Others*

* Sphinx's Revelation - This card is nuts in all formats and can really change the direction of a game or put it out of reach.
* Supreme Verdict / Wrath of God - 4 Mana Board wipes that have a plus to each of them.
* Shadow of Doubt - Hate card for pod and fetches if need be that replaces itself.
* Think Twice - Best card draw we have that is still bad.
* Sword of ______ - The swords are all pretty powerful in there own way

*Planeswalkers*

* Ajani Vengeant - Lightning Helix on a stick and a one sided Armageddon ultimate.
* Elspeth, Knight-Errant - Can make Geist and Snaps a lot more powerful with a powerful ultimate and can put out tokens.
* Gideon Jura - Can be a creature and takes damage for you.
* There are other U/W/R walkers but I don't think any of them fit our game plan.(Ral Zarek, All Jaces, All Chandras, Other Ajanis, Elspeth Tirel)

*Sideboard**

* Stony Silence / Kataki, War's Wage - Artifact Hate which is better?
* Pyroclasm - Really hurts a lot of decks like Pod.
* Celestial Purge - Liliana of the Veil and other Black stuff
* Engineered Explosives - Just a good card
* Sowing Salt / Molten Rain - Mana Denial along side Tec Edge main board Hurts Tron a lot.
* Threads of Disloyalty - Tarmogoyf
* Wear / Tear - Better than Disenchant
* Spellskite - Hate for a lot of cards in the format
* Relic of Progenitus / Grafdigger's Cage - Graveyard Hate

**Thoughts**

UWR has a lot of choices on what kind of deck they want to play as and what kind of creature/burn/counter package they want and That's what makes it a tier 1 deck in the format. I really enjoy this format and I find myself looking for changes and reasoning behind changes to the deck I am running. So I would like a more in depth understanding of UWR and Modern as format itself. If there are any new decklist or cards to check out I'm all ears and would love to give them a try.

**Questions I have** 

* Why has Geist been dropped from recent lists?
* Why aren't the swords used more?
* What other variations of UWR are there that can really shake up the format?
* Which is the best version in the current format?
* Why aren't there other U/W/x decks in the format such as esper and bant?

any feedback on my post would be great and thanks in advance for helping!

Background, I've been playing Kiki Pod for a while now and decided to finish up Melira Pod since I'm just a few cards off anyway. So far, I've tested the deck against my friends' decks/proxies. Notably R/G tron and Scapeshift. Other decks include Goryo's, UB mill, and Genesis Wave.

What I fail to understand is why Melira Pod puts up such great results? I feel like overall the deck just does weaker things than kiki pod. The beatdown plan only feels marginally better and pyroclasm is a huge blowout most of the time.

Of course, I may be subject to a bit of bias since apparently Scapeshift and Tron are some of Melira Pod's worse matchups. However, in a large scale tournament Melira Pods must be playing against these decks too, correct?

What cards can improve it?,25,7,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/1hy80s/standard_why_did_prime_speaker_bant_fall_off_the/,"For a short time post-Gatecrash, Prime Speaker Bant top-8ed a couple of events. After the release of Dragon's Maze though, it seems this deck has fallen out of favor, seeing as it didn't gain much. Other decks improved with DGM, but Prime Speaker stagnated. Still, other decks emerged, namely Junk Aristocrats, which further pushed Prime Speaker from the spotlight. 

http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/prime-speaker-bant-09-07-13-1/

I've stuck with this deck, 3-0ing most FNM's, and I plan on taking it to SCG Somerset in a couple of weeks. What cards can I add to improve it? 

* Voice of Resurgence is supposedly an obvious inclusion, but I'm not really sure what I'd cut, seeing as Loxodon Smiter is a much better wall for aggro. It's worse against control though, so there's that.
* Progenitor Mimic started as a joke, replacing Prime Speaker, but cloning Angel of Serenity or Thragtusk each turn is not. However, the Mimic usually ends up being a removal sink, getting killed before the next upkeep. Still, I believe having the opponent play around Mimic is a benefit of its own. 
* Advent of the Wurm is great to bring in for aggro, though I'm not sure if I can mainboard it. 

MATCHUPS:

I've tested against: 

* R/G Aggro and Naya Aggro - This is a fairly simple match to play against, it's just a matter of drawing the cards I need. Turn 1 dork, turn 2 Smiter, turn 3 Advent should stall long enough until I find a Thragtusk. Supreme Verdict comes in as a reset button, and Trostani comes in for the extra lifegain. 

* Jund Midrange - A tough matchup. It usually ends up grindy and extended, with both sides gaining inordinate amounts of life. I'm at a disadvantage here; Jund has access to one of the best removal suites, along with solid sweepers like Mortars and Bonfire. Post-board, I bring in the 3rd and 4th Slime, along with Sigarda. Selesnya Charm also replaces Azorius Charm, dealing with their 'tusks, Sires (and if shit hits the fan), their pumped Olivia's. I've tried bringing in Clone and Pithing Needle, but this usually dilutes the deck's power. 

* Junk Reanimator - More or less the same as Jund Midrange, though I have an easier time, as they lack the removal. Same SB plan + Rest in Peace. 

* Junk Aristocrats - This is interesting. I haven't tested against this deck as much, but the majority of the games, I steamroll them before any demons or anything above 4 power hits the board. Pithing needle and Acidic Slimes come in, though I'm really shaky on a sideboard plan here. 

* U/W/x Control - Frankly, this matchup is a cinch. It really shouldn't be, due to my weakness to sweeps, but I have no trouble beating them down post-Verdict. Slime comes in, Azorius Charms come out, and that's really about it. I'm thinking Advent might be good here, but I'm not really sure. 

TL;DR: I've seen less and less people playing Prime Speaker due to DGM. What can I do to improve my deck against the current meta, namely midrange decks? Also, my sideboard is pretty shaky, if you could take a look at it.

The down sides are obvious, very easy to remove as it dies to almost every removal spell in standard, and it costs double white. The upsides are game winning though.

Lawmage costs 4, but comes out way ahead when it comes to removal and wears *quesadillas** like a champ.

Con:

* Costs mana for the combo effect.
* Requires Blue
* Doesn't randomly hose Infect

Pro:

* Doesn't need to stay in play once the ability is used in order to combo out, so you could Pod it directly into a Finks (or into an Exarch, untap the pod, and grab a Redcap) and potentially combo out earlier.

1358932930.0,15,self.spikes,174566,[Standard] My Frites Deck has been doing well recently at local tournaments,21,6,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/174566/standard_my_frites_deck_has_been_doing_well/,"http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/unburial-rites-31-10-12-1/

I can go through this deck in detail.  I have playtested it a lot. And this deck has very few bad matchups.  My most recent FNM, I didn't lose a single game. And this deck has done me well for at least a month.  These are the matchups for this deck. I wouldn't mind getting some feedback, I would like to take this to some bigger tournaments soon.

With Gate crash coming out, this deck isnt going to change much, it will benefit from the extra shocklands, and will use blind obediance sideboard for the rdw matchup



**Agaist RDW:**

+2 supreme Verdict

+3 lingering Souls (normally a bit hesitant due to Ash Zealot)

-2 sever the bloodline

-1 angel of serenity

-1 craterhoof behemoth

-1 alchemist refuge

Definitely my worst matchup is RDW, though I can get around it with t2 augur and t4 Supreme verdict or t5 thagtusk. But if they win the dice roll, they will normally win game 1. Then I can normally stabilize and gain my life back. Though t4 verdict isn't always necessary, If i can get t4 or t5 angel i normally win.


**Against Naya Aggro:**

+2 supreme verdict

+3 golgari charm  (wrecks there tokens, wrecks double strike math, gets rid of their mana dorks, and will destroy rest in peace/nevermore

+1 sundering growth

-2 sever the bloodline 

-1 cavern of souls

-1 Angel of Serenity

-1 Craterhoof Behemoth

-1 Centaur Healer or Thragtusk (depending on how aggro their deck is)

Again a little bit of a rougher matchup, but moving Augur to mainboard recently has really helped game 1.  I normally will stall enough to set up my graveyard and get either a t5 or t6 angel and just wreck havoc to their board state


**Against Reanimator:**

+3 Deathrite Shaman

-1 centaur healer

-1 cavern of souls

-1 thragtusk

I have played against 2 different reanimator decks, the first one was junk and focused more around lingering souls and craterhoof, and the second was the newer Human reanimator. The first one was a little bit harder, but with sever the bloodline and alchemist refuge to flash in my angel whenever i wanted. it ends pretty shortly after that.
Against Human reanimator, I have a better matchup, flashing in supreme verdict in opponents combat utterly wrecks his field. I find alchemist refuge will win me this matchup.


**Zombies**

Depending on exactly which type of zombie they run will vary what comes in

+2 verdict

+2 golgari charm (sometimes, it wrecks all the 1 toughness)

+2 deathrite shaman (gets rid of gravecrawler and geralf's)

-1 Thragtusk

-1 craterhoof

-1 angel

Not a horrible matchup, especially if I get centaur healer or augur of bolas out early, the 3 toughness will slow them enough that i can drop thragtusk or angel to turn the game around.  


**Door To Nothingness**

+2 sundering growth

sometimes something else, depending which variant they run

-1 cavern of souls

-1 angel of serenity

Surprisingly this is a difficult matchup, (and for some reason I always fight a door deck) this deck will take a few turns to set up and then swing lethal in a turn, but they will play a fog effect and craterhoof on field becomes useless.  If i get an early body and start swinging away, I normally can force their fogs and win quickly.


**Against Control**

+1 Cavern of Souls

+3 deathrite shaman

-2 terminus

-2 supreme verdict

I don't think this deck has ever lost a game to control.  I was very close one time, he was playing with Jace, memory adept only sideboard, and we got to time before we could finish game one.  I ended up with less than 10 cards in my deck. Normally, alchemist refuge and cavern of souls together will wreck control, then deathrite shaman is there to take care of their snapcaster or their Tamiyo emblem.


**Bant hexproof**

+2 supreme verdict

-1 angel of serenity

-1 cavern of souls
I haven't got to play against it much but I normally hit a fieldwipe and thats enough to change it into my favor, then it becomes a pretty easy win for me. 


If there is a deck I am missing, (I'm sure I am missing one), but these seem to be the main matchups I run into consistantly.

She recently did her own write up on the event [here](http://magic.tcgplayer.com/db/article.asp?ID=10794).

Most of the comments in the /r/magicTCG thread on the subject ([Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/1208rn/jackie_lees_side_of_the_story_life_totals/)) seem to think she her actions were unethical and malicious.

It seems to me that what she did was perfectly reasonable and that the rules need a bit more clarification if wrong doing actually occurred in this situation.

Her opponent neglected to vocally announce the Stab Wound triggers, despite writing down the changes to her life total.  Jackie, thinking the trigger is missed because it isn't announced, doesn't say anything or change her life total.  She is not responsible for her opponent's missed triggers under the current rules.

Once her opponent notices the discrepancy in life totals, Jackie calls for the judge.  It is explained and she is found at fault for not noting the difference in life totals when it happens, which is its own rule that was technically broken here.  

However, without the Stab Wounds triggers, there wouldn't be a difference it life totals.  I don't see why the other player wasn't found accountable for his mistakes.
 
 
As my own Devil's Advocate viewpoint:

She mentions that the opponent at one point claimed that he did announce them, possibly quietly.  It could be that the judge took his word since Jackie's actions were possibly intentional cheating.  However, that seems like the judge would be in a bit of trouble for jumping to that conclusion without evidence.


So I'm curious what people here think since there will be more of the competitive mindset.

Basically, we're looking to see if the room's a barrel full of fish. 

What we see decides our deck choices.

4x Delver

4x Snapcaster

4x Resto Angel

Yeah, Mirran Crusader. Remember, it's a room full of Timmys and Johnnys. The Timmys are playing bad Zombie decks and Big Green. The Johnnies are playing odd Pod things, Venser and/or Tezzeret decks, durdling with Trading Post, and other slow stuff.

I've wanted to try my hand at deck building for a while, but it always just feels like I'm slapping good cards into a deck with synergy and then throwing land in and then testing a million times until I get the right fit. I'd like to cut that process down if I can and there is a more efficient approach. Thanks!

It survived Deathrite Shaman and Rest in Peace, though.  Are the new additions really that fatal to the deck?

When I've been reanimating before M14 arrived, I've been using the Lotleth Troll plan.  Repeatable blocking is great against aggro, and occasionally you can pitch a bomb to the Troll and reanimate it immediately when there was nothing else in the bin to target with Unburial.  

Perhaps the new cards that supposedly hose our deck can actually be used to our advantage in that spot, though.  Lifebane Zombie could prevent Ooze from ever hitting the field if they don't play it turn 2, against aggro it can kill a Ghor-Clan, and it hits a lot of other decks hard (including the mirror match).  A couple Abrupt Decays or Doomblades could take care of any Oozes already in play before Lifebane arrives.

Scavenging Ooze would of course find a spot in the sideboard for hate against Snapcaster decks, other Reanimators, and decks with lots of undying creatures such as Junk Aristocrats.

I have spent a few weeks crafting together a deck for the WMCQ this weekend and I feel I've got it right.  At first I was planning on running RG aggro but I decided why not run white?  White gives you access to Voice of Resurgence as well as Loxodon Smiter which is where I started.  Then, I realized Cackler and Noble were not very effective in this deck.

I switched out those cards for a playset of both the GW Charm as well as Call of the Conclave, both of these cards are stronger than the one drops because they aren't completely dead if I draw them past turn 2.  White also gives me access to strong sideboard potential with Rest in Peace, Unflinching Courage and Ray of Revelation for those pesky Aura decks that were neigh unwinnable playing RG aggro.

Now, onto the Main Deck: http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/naya-aggromidrange-30-05-13-1/

Pillar of Flame as a one of is necessary, it used to be 3 but then I discovered Boros Charm is a card with so much blowout potential.  It doesn't do too much against aggro right now when they run Reckoners and Flinthoof Boars but I have 3 SB just in case.

Two Drops:

Flinthoof Boar is an insane card, 80% of the time it's a 3/3 for two or at the worst a 2/2 that can attack right away.  Call of the conclave has the benefits of always being a 3/3 for 2.  Voice of Resurgence is INSANE. It's solid against aggro, either eating a pillar or two creatures.  It also gives me another guy after a board wipe, the only gripe is it does not work well with Rest in Peace. Now, the searing spears are solid because they give me the reach to kill or just blow up a guy. The GW Charm's are full of utility, I have a problem against Reanimator so when they get their angel, EoT I get my guys back without them being able to reanimate her again.  The Boros Charms allow for blowouts such as Ghor-Clan+Boros charm, or just insurance against board wipes.

Three Drops:

Boros Reckoner is a god damn beast.  He can almost always two for one your opponent so I made it sure that I can always cast him on turn 3, no Forests in this deck!  Loxodon Smiter is such a hedge against aggro, oh you run a bunch of 2 and 3 power guys? Hello there!  I run four of both because these cards are the ones that usually win me the game.

Four Drops:
Ghor-Clan, my personal favorite creature in standard.  You need the skill to not get blown out by a removal spell as well as knowing when to play it as a creature, I am a big fan of versatility.  Hellrider is there to just win the game on the spot or put the opponent in a terrible position, this guy + reckoner is so brutal. Only 3 because it sucks having two in the opening hand.

There's the deck! I have yet to playtest it other than having a couple hands, the mana base hurts it one in, say, 25 hands so it's got really tight mana.  Comment on what you think of it, such as matchup potential and if it has a good shot of taking down the WMCQ.

-2 Clifftop Retreat

-3 Hellrider

-4 Flinthoof boar

I have a problem though; I have no idea whether any of these decks are good or worthy directions to go in. This is a question that I've struggled with when building decks.

I could goldfish them, but that doesn't really seem to tell you much beyond how consistently the mana works. I can play them against the field to test, but I can't do that enough to get anything conclusive. I'm sure any of those decks would survive an FNM, but that's not what I'm concerned about- I want to know if I can play it in a tournament. I'm generally stuck evaluating cards on feelings- this card seems bad, or I don't like this deck all that much. 

Once I find a deck to focus on, I can go ahead and test with that deck and tune it to be the best it can be. I have problems getting to that point, though. When I pick the wrong deck to focus on, I'll find myself with a deck I can't really make competitive- and then I'll have to audible to a common meta deck proved good by performance at large events.

* Do you want more of Liliana in an aggro matchup for the 3 drop removal? Or less because she's too slow? 

* Is it a good idea to keep her in a Naya matchup when they could Loxodon? Or is the discard disruption enough to not be bothered by it?

* How about against Rites? Do you really want to help them get more things into the graveyard? Or is the removal powerful enough to justify her inclusion?


**Bonfire:**

* Do you leave these in versus other midrange decks? It clears out mana dorks and eventually can sweep even AoS. However, its kind of an awkward early draw.

**Tragic Slip:**

* Amazing removal for aggro decks, but is the morbid requirement too much for other midrange decks? Should they be left in against rites to clear dorks?


**Ground Seal:**

* Obvious versus Unburial rites, but is it worth leaving in to prevent Snapcaster flashback?

the problem I have is that I'm playing actively again since March 2012. I visited a few GPs and attend local tournaments. I started winning more and more and whilst always going like 4-1 or something at local tournies, my performance peaked with a grinder win at GP Ghent and then Top 32 at GP Lyon. It was all good and I was developing.

Now since that GP I played a couple of tournaments where I absolutely did not perform at all. I had a PTQ and while I think my deck choice was good, I did not even make Top 16. Then cam an abmissal GP Bilbao with the wrong deck choice and a lot of losses. I don't even perform well at the local tournaments anymore: the last one on sunday, I only managed to win 1 round of 5 with Wolf Run Bant in Standard.

I get the feeling that there's something wrong and that I should do way better at those events. I am not sure where this comes from but all I see is that my results as of late are simply lacking.

Let's look at what format all-stars we're working with:

**RED:**

* Bonfire of the Damned
* Hellrider
* Searing Spear
* Thundermaw Hellkite
* Zealous Conscripts
* Rakdos Cackler
* Ash Zealot

**BLUE:**

* Delver of Secrets
* Snapcaster Mage
* Dissipate
* Syncopate
* Augur of Bolas
* Jace, Architect of Thought
* Unsummon

**GREEN:**

* Thragtusk
* Farseek
* Strangleroot Geist
* Arbor Elf
* Garruk, Primal Hunter

**MULTI:**

* Huntmaster of the Fells
* Alchemist's Refuge

There are also many cards with potential that haven't seen much play this season. Things like Quirion Dryad, Dungeon Geists, Lone Revenant, Izzet Charm, Simic Charm, etc. There are too many to list.

**Potential RUG Archetypes:**

* Aggro: Not my first choice of colors when considering aggro, but I suppose there is potential. Cloudfin raptor, snapcaster mage, strangleroot geist, ash zealot. I'm not really feeling it but I won't leave it out.

* Midrange: I'd say there's a lot of potential here. You've got the traditional Huntmaster, Thragtusk. You miss out on Resto Angel, Silverblade, Loxodon that white brings, so I guess it's just a matter of what does blue bring to make up for that? Counters are nice, maybe not in a creature meta filled with cavern of souls though. Draw is good. There are a few good blue creatures that haven't seen play yet. Deadeye Navigator might be a good alternative to Restoration Angel. Gatecrash is a weak set but there might be potential in Zegana.

* Control: Control isn't really my strong suite. I think RUG lacks the board wipes needed for control. I don't know if bonfire is a good enough replacement wipe

* Tempo: Maybe the best hope for these colors being tournament-playable. Red for cheap burn, blue for tempo and counters, green for Dryad, possibly Mayor, also as a splash for simic charm.



I've been trying out a tempo deck running 4x Delver, 4x Quirion Dryad, and 4x Mayor of Avabruck with 2x Snapcaster and 27 spells, nearly all 1-2 cmc tempo and counters with all stars like simic charm and izzet charm. It seems to work pretty well. I'd post a decklist but it's not refined enough yet for /r/spikes.

I see the top decklists for both RDW and B/R Agro (Not the Zombie varient) seem to hold that the Noble is a must play 4 off.   

I understand that Noble is good because it generally forces out a removal spell, against against Humans it can get out of hand fast, but it seems to follow that in the late game it's pretty much dead weight in my deck.  I know that RDW and B/R Agro are supposed to win fast, so that's not really the problem, but after about turn 3 the Noble rarely does any good at all.  

Stonewright on the other hand creates a dual threat, when it attacks and when its partner attacks it makes both scarier, plus when my small creatures get outclassed it slows down my opponent, and makes my threats scarier.  

In my weekly standard I 3-1ed, having lost in the final due to my own stupidity with the following decklist.  I've also played some high-curved RDWs that only use 8 1-drops, and I've considered but never tryed playing 4 Cacklers and 4 Stonewrights over 4 Nobles.

Alan Lee – Lifebane Jund – 6th Place

Here is a tournament report from my 6th place finish at SCG Open: SLC. I played in the Saturday Open and ended up going 3-4 and dropping. 

[**Deck List**](http://sales.starcitygames.com//deckdatabase/displaydeck.php?DeckID=58342)

**Round 1: Matt – UWR Flash**
**Game 1:** This is a long drawn out game and he ends up winning after playing Sphinx’s Revelation 3x and I just ran out of threats and had a lot of useless removal cards in hand. When I could land a Thragtusk, he would Turn and Burn it.
**Game 2:** I sideboard out most of my removal and bring in my good cards. I am able to keep my threats on the board and win fairly easily. I was also able to resolve a Ruric, Thar the Unbowed and he took 6 getting rid of it.
**Game 3:** He gets stuck on 3 land and I have farseek and double liliana of the veil. He counters the first one but I am able to resolve the 2nd and start destroying his hand. I am able to Rakdos’s Return and land a thragtusk.
1-0	(2-1)

**Round 2: Steven – UWR Flash**
**Game 1:** He counters a few of my threats and is able to Sphinx’s Revelation for 4 and then for 6. The game goes longer but I end up scooping when I run out of threats.
**Game 2:** He keeps slow hand and I end up casting a thragtusk into a Ruric Thar. He is down to 10 and can’t do anything and scoops.
**Game 3:** We both keep and he doesn’t have counter  for my thragtusk. He does Warleader Helix after I get one swing with my thragtusk but I am able to wolf run my beast and Olivia to win.
2-0	(4-2)

**Round 3: Julia – Bant Hexproof**
**Game 1:** I keep a slow hand and she throws down a turn 1 Gladecover Scout and suits it up and I die on turn 5.
**Game 2:** I have Farseek into Lifebane Zombie into double Thragtusk. She tries to race me with a suited up Invisible Stalker (no Unflinching Courage) but I am able to win the race.
**Game 3:** She plays a Voice and hits me for 2 into a Smiter. I remove the Voice on my turn and she swings in the next turn and plays an Invisible Stalker. On my turn I cast a Golgari Charm, Tragic Slip the Smiter and the token dies. I end up playing a Liliana and get rid of her creature after the “wipe” and throw a thragtusk down.

3-0	(6-3)

**Round 4: Jeremy – Junk Aristocrats**
**Game 1:** I end up playing a Lifebane Zombie into a Thragtusk but I run out of Sac outlets for desecration demon and die.
**Game 2:** I get off to a fast start with a Farseek  and removal. I play Thragtusk then I play a Scavenging Ooze and eat everything up.
**Game 3:** He gets a blood artist out quick but I am able to get rid of it. He ends up with a board of Desecration Demon, Cartel Aristocrat and Varolz. I am at about 3 life with a huntmaster. I am able to sac and block the next turn to survive but he draws a blood artist and wins. I draw the next card and it is a Bonfire (would have killed the demon) and the next card after that is a Thragtusk. He ended up drawing the exact card he needed to win.

3-1 (7-5)

**Round 5: Lance – U/W Control**
**Game 1:** I am able to play a few thragtusks but he is able to rev and ult Jace and I scoop.
**Game 2:** I sideboard in a ton of cards and he has a slow start and he can’t stop my huntmaster and thragtusk.
**Game 3:** I am able to rakdos return him for 2. The next turn I am able to Duress when he has 3 cards in hand. He thinks about it for a little bit and he ends up not countering it. He shows an Aetherling, Sphinx and Syncopate. I get rid of the Syncopate and then I rakdos return for 2 again. At this point, he can’t deal withthragtusk and wolf run.

4-1 (9-6)

**Round 6: Thomas – R/W Aggro**
**Game 1:** He is on the play and throws down a turn 2 Thalia and it really just slows down my hand because I had a farseek in hand and I could have played huntmaster a turn early but end up falling behind too much.
**Game 2:** I am able to play a Thragtusk to kind of stabilize against his early aggression but then I miracle a bonfire for 4 wiping his board of Sublime/Knight of Glory and Silverblade. I follow it up with a Scavenging Ooze and a Huntmaster and he can’t recover from the Bonfire.
**Game 3:** I keep a removal heavy hand and am able to deal with his threats. He tries to play Burning Earth and I float G/B to Golgari Charm after it resolves. I am able to land 2 huntmasters and ride them to victory.

5-1 (11-7)

**Round 7: Buddy – Rakdos Control**
**Game 1:** I am able to keep bigger threats on the board and end up winning the top deck battle.
**Game 2:** He Rakdos’s Returns me and I do it back and he ends up winning the top deck battle with Bonfire.
**Game 3:** I start off with a Farseek into Huntmaster then another Huntmaster. He Returns me for 2 then Mutilates and wipes the board. We are both in top deck mode and life totals are 20-4. I’m not worried because I’m thinking I will surely be able to draw something before he kills me. I also have Bonfire/Rakdos to just win the game. I draw a land and he top decks a Desecration Demon, I draw another land. He swings for 6, it’s now 14-4. I draw a land and he swings another making it 8-4 and then plays Olivia and passes. At this point I’m super nervous and worried that my chances of top 8 are over. I untap and draw an Olivia. I count my land and I have 9 land! I play Olivia and then I steal his Olivia and sacrifice it. He untaps and draws and then swings with desecration demon, I say no blocks and go down to 2. He has 1 card in hand a passes. I draw, ping desecration demon and swing in for 4. He shows a land and I win!

6-1 (13-8)

**Round 8** 
After 7 rounds of Swiss, I am 6-1 and have the best tie breakers for all 6-1’s. I am 3rd in the standings and I get paired up against the #1 player in standings and we intentionally draw into top 8.

6-1-1 (13-8-3)

**Top 8**
It is announced that the 4th seed is my Round 4 opponent (Jeremy) and then I am the 5th seed. I’m not happy about playing against him again especially on the draw again.

**Game 1:** I am able to stay alive and get him to 12. I misplay by playing a bonfire for 2 then playing a Garruk Primal Hunter. He had a desecration demon and is able to swing with that. I should have played the Garruk, Sac’d the beast token then net turn bonfire’d and then kept sac’ing the beast to the demon.
**Game 2:** He gets off to a decent start and all I have is 2 Lifebane Zombies. I have an Olivia in hand and I’m hoping to ride that out to victory but I know he has 2x Tragic Slip and I’m not able to comeback and win.

6-2-1 (13-10-3)

All in all, it was a great experience for my first SCG Open. I was really feeling down after playing so poorly on Saturday and essentially punting 3 rounds when I could have won. I debated whether or not I should play Sunday because I didn't really want to play another 8-9 rounds of magic. I force myself because I pre-registered for the event already. After the Saturday Open, I ended up taking 2 Lifebane Zombies out and putting 1 Garruk, Primal Hunter in and an Abrupt Decay. As I walk into the tournament, I decide to change it back and play the same 75 as the day before. I ended up playing well and it just goes to show that just because you do poorly with a deck one day that you can’t be successful the next. I think that I played a lot better on Sunday, had good matchups and got lucky a few times.

**Moving forward:**
I dislike the Lifebane Zombies. I have taken them out and added more removal. I feel like it is a great card but it is not a great card for Jund in the current Meta. If Big Domri Naya or Junk Reanimator is big again I can see including it.
Just remember, you’re going to have bad days when you play magic and you are going to hate the game but all it takes is one good day to change everything and sometimes, you won’t experience that one good day if you decide to stop playing because you’re losing. Keep playing and your day will come! 
See you at the invitational in Vegas and many more events!

Specifically, Lifebane Zombie and Xathrid Necromancer.  Junk aristocrats wants both, but in my opinion the mana is bad for t2 GW t3 1BB.  Joshua Silvestri suggests moving to a mostly BW shell for humans, and I think the same logic can apply to zombies (notice that xathrid necromancer does zombies as well, so there's potential for both in the same deck).  I would really like to break open that dicussion a bit more and figure out which direction Cartel Aristocrat decks want to take moving forward.




Lets start with Junk Aristocrats:



Decklist: http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/junk-aristocrats-18-07-13-5/



This deck attempts to make the best possible use of a creature recursion engine.  



-Obviously the nuts is having Aristocrat, Blood Artist and Necromancer on board.  If you cast increasing devotion that represents 12 blood artist triggers and an unblockable aristocrat for what should be game OR an army of 5 diregraf ghouls. Value city people. But even just Xathrid Necromancer and increasing devotion is nuts.  It also plays very well with the Voice Elemental.  



-Some people are arguing for the removal of blood artist, and I'm not entirely opposed to that idea, especially if you are replacing it with maybe Champion of the parish.  


-Personally I like Avacyn's Pilgirm as the one drop of choice. For 1, he is human, and with a necromancer on board turns into a young wolf that ramps.  The Possibility of T1 Pilgrim T2 Necromancer should set you up very well, especially if you can curve out into T3 Garruk or T4 Obzedat/Increasing Devotion.  Also T2 Souls T3 Aristocrat Blood Artist is a very strong line of play.  The way I see it, if we are cutting young wolf we need to improve our clock and get to the endgame a little faster.  This is IMO the best deck for Pilgrim yet.


- A notable ommision is Skirsdag High priest.  Act II cut him because they only had Doomed Traveler to set up a turn 3 demon. This deck now runs into the same problem.  Priest also doesn't play well with Necromancer, as the tokens enter tapped.  You could convince me I'm wrong about this, but I've always hated how much of a glass cannon High Priest was to begin with. 








Now I wanted to also get some input on this BW Zombies build: 


http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/bw-zombies-18-07-13-1/


The mana for this deck is much better than what Junk is doing, and it crushes a huge portion of the field.  Lifebane Zombie into restoration angel is the biggest beating Jund can suffer.  The only creature you can't take that you need to worry about is Olivia.  Huntmaster and thragtusk, their biggest value creatures are sniped out, possibly back to back.  Against Naya you get Aurelia, Reckoner, Voice, Resto Angel.  The number of creature that are either White or Green right now is astounding.  


-Between Resto Angel, Lifebane Zombie, blood artist, and Geralf's Messenger, you should win any attrition war by a long long mile.  


-Obviously has some problems with RG aggro as it doesn't block.  Luckily Doom blade is a catch all against them and makes Ghor-Clan Rampager look bad.  On the play you can hit the very troublesome reckoner with LB Zombie, and if you have to block bears, Gnawing Zombie is surprisingly good against their army of bears and blocks very favorably againt their one drops.  I will say against this deck that you have a terrible matchup on the draw.



Against Reanimator, LB Zombie Exiles all their relevant threats and the only threats you should face are the ones in the yard G1.  G2 and G3 I would bring in cremate, as you can't run RIP because of messenger and Souls.  This matchup should be fairly easy.



- This deck hates pillar of flame and will obviously see some cross hate because of VoR, but I think the top end of Resto Angel Obzedat should keep you ahead against UWR and Grixis.  These matchups are slightly in their favor, but  I wouldn't anticipate seeing too much control this weekend so I would hope to dodge it as much as possible.





Hopefully these decks are good starting points for discussing the future of aristocrats style decks well into theros.  We have some great tools and we seem pretty divided on how to best use them.  Please let me know what you think of my sample decks as well, I want to take one or the other to an IQ sunday, and would like some advice.

The deck list is quite similar to the one used in spring states by Raymond Perez (Planeswalker-heavy). The deck has a steady performance vs. aggressive decks and does particularly well against Jund but suffers heavily against Reanimator and particular cards (see below for examples).

Long story short, I really believe that this meta is extremely unforgiving towards Esper. With the popularity of voice, (extremely hard for Esper to deal with effectively) Planeswalkers, (Domri and Garruk in particular which Esper has nearly no answer, save Detention Sphere) and even Assemble (although Jayce, Architect of Thought does handle the card quite effectively) it just seems like I'm bashing my head against a brick wall playing a SLOW Tier two control deck. So I'm giving control another shot with American Midrange, specifically this following decklist:

1 AEtherling 2 Snapcaster Mage -Creatures (3)

1 Jace, Architect of Thought 1 Tamiyo, the Moon Sage -Planeswalkers [2]

4 Azorius Charm 3 Dissipate 2 Essence Scatter 3 Pillar of Flame 2 Searing Spear 3 Sphinx's Revelation 2 Supreme Verdict 2 Syncopate 1 Terminus 1 Assemble the Legions 3 Think Twice 2 Turn // Burn 2 Warleader's Helix -Spells [30]

4 Clifftop Retreat 1 Desolate Lighthouse 4 Glacial Fortress 4 Hallowed Fountain 1 Island 1 Plains 2 Sacred Foundry 4 Steam Vents 4 Sulfur Falls -Lands [25]

SIDEBOARD 2 Detention Sphere 1 Dispel 2 Izzet Staticaster 2 Rest In Peace 1 Dispel 3 Negate 1 Pithing Needle 1 Pillar of Flame 1 Supreme Verdict 1 Turn // Burn

I'd love some thoughts on the deck list from people, with the possible cards to exclude or include (I've been mulling over Assemble the Legions) or some experience stories of playing with the deck. What were some of your hard match ups? How did you side? Or just your thoughts in general.

Reasons for some of my changes:

* 15 lands was too inconsistent. 4x Blinkmoth/4x Inkmoth seemed too important. I put in an island over the Steam Vents because getting hit by a Path really hurts otherwise.

* Thoughtcast seemed too important. Having only two didn't seem right.

But after playing my list a bit in the last week, I have a few questions.

* Dispatch over Galvanic Blast? Dispatch is almost always a better Path, but Galvanic Blast gives extra reach.

* Is Steelshaper's Gift worth playing? I've considered dropping a Thoughtcast for one since I am usually digging for a Cranial Plating anyway.

* Etched Champion in the main? I've noticed quite a few MTGO lists with 3x Etched Champion in the main.

I recently switched it to mono-blue, as I was not sure how strong the black splash for removal was without BitterBlossom. Some of the cards I have on my list that I am not sure about are Shadow of doubt, but i like it due to it shutting down fetches and drawing me a card, it can also stop a Chord of Calling, or any other tutor to slow down combo. Sower of temptation I could see being really good with a scion on the field, especially if it is flashed out through an aether vial. I really like the way the vial plays, it allows me to hold mana for counters while then being able to get out a faerie and a counter or two faeries per turn depending on what is necessary. I couldn't decide on 2-4 Vendilion Cliques but a friend suggested running 4 of them, so I am trying it. Ghost quarter is my favorite land removal, I prefer it a lot over tec edge, as it does not have an activation cost or a required amount of lands in play, so it can kill an inkmoth nexus or any of the urza lands before they become a problem. Pestermite can untap aether vial or tap down most threats Mistbind clique is a nice finisher or can stop their combo the turn you think it can go off.

Recently though, there have been at least two decks in the top 8 of PTQs featuring a Nivix Cyclops-centric build.

The first is a UWR build piloted by Travis Woo to a 4th place finish shown [here](http://forums.mtgsalvation.com/showthread.php?t=516826).

The second is a RUG build that [brought in 7th](http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/rug-cyclops-25-05-13-2/) at a PTQ in Japan.

Both forms of the deck run 7-8 loot abilities and a play set of thought scours.  These form the backbone of the decks as they allow for massive filtering and feed your graveyard.  Later on they can still be used for spellcast triggers at a small cost.  They both also utilize artful dodge and nivix cyclops.

The UWR variant runs guttersnipe and a large amount of burn spells.  To get value out of the graveyard it runs a full 4 snapcasters.  Finally, it runs Boros Charm to stop sweepers and give the potential for a 20 damage blowout (artful dodge, artful dodge, boros charm).

The RUG deck uses Delver and Augur to capitalize on the large amount of instant and sorcery spells.  Instead of Snapcasters, it uses 2 Runechanter's Pikes to take full advantage of your looting effects.  Simic Charm and Ranger's Guile provide protection for your creatures, while Flesh//Blood give you a huge amount of damage to your opponent's face.

What do you think?  Do these kinds of deck have staying power in a meta filled with aggro and midrange strategies, or are they flukes generated by the element of surprise that any opponent expecting this kind of deck will stomp?",,False,,t5_2utkz,False,,,True,t3_1go3ub,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/1go3ub/standard_urx_cyclops_a_competitive_deck/,

I took this [deck](http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/uwr-midrange-07-05-13-4/) to Gameday at my LGS and did fairly well with it (making top 8 both days). That being said, the sideboard still needs a lot of work, specifically against Bant Flash (I lost all three matches against it 1-2 winning a combination of both pre and post sideboard games).

The first day, I tried the sideboard plan of:

+2 Pillar of Flame

+2 Negate



-3 Searing Spear

-1 Warleader's Helix



The second day, I tried to change it up a little bit and went with:

+2 Pillar of Flame

+2 Negate

+3 Rest in Peace

+2 Council of the Absolute



-3 Searing Spear

-3 Snapcaster Mage

-2 Warleader's Helix

-1 Boros Reckoner



I know that the second day was not optimal, but I was trying to come at it in more of a proactive way (shutting down snapcaster, pike, and moorland haunt) than the previous day. I found that I was missing the necessary reach after siding out most of my burn spells. 

I feel as though Council of the Absolute can be removed from the sideboard. It is a slightly better, and more fragile, nevermore in the UWx matchups and Nevermore is not seen in many sideboards as it is. I am not sure what to replace it with or what other changes could be made to the sideboard to sure up other matchups. Any advice would be appreciated

I'm playing RDW on 21, opponent is on 7. Opponent has full tron on the board (plus RG mana) and three cards in hand.

He was on 11 and had a Wurmcoil Engine on the board, which he has just attacked with. I blocked with a Keldon Maurauder and then used Skullcrack to take him to 8 life (no lifegain). Maurauder dies and I take him to 7.

I have a land, another Keldon Maurader and a lightning bolt in my hand. There is an almost exactly 50% chance that my next card is a 3 damage burn spell, which in conjunction with the lightning bolt and mauler, will kill him.

Should I bolt the wurmcoil, giving him a 3/3 lifegain creature, or should I bolt him and hope that I draw a burn spell to win next turn?

    7 Swamp
    4 Inkmoth Nexus
    4 Overgrown Tomb
    4 Verdant Catacombs
    2 Howltooth Hollow
    1 Urborg, Tomb of Yawgmoth

    4 Dark Confidant
    4 Phyrexian Crusader
    2 Deathrite Shaman

    4 Funeral Charm
    4 Raven's Crime
    4 Disfigure
    4 Inquisition of Kozilek
    4 Wrench Mind
    1 Doom Blade
    1 Go for the Throat

    4 Liliana of the Veil
    2 Runechanter's Pike

    SB: 2 Deathrite Shaman
    SB: 4 Infest
    SB: 4 Nature's Claim
    SB: 3 Nihil Spellbomb
    SB: 2 Sickening Shoal

After a bit of play testing online, I'm fairly impressed by the list. I think it goes without saying that Liliana, DRS and Bob form a goodstuff.dec core. It takes the Jund recipe with an emphasis on control early followed by a quick infect win after stabilizing.

Deathrite with retrace is quite nice on our side. Howltooth+Liliana also play very nicely together. All the discard help to give DRS and pike lots to work with.

I think there's still a lot of room for refinement:

* LftL is something I'd like to fit in. Howltooth does a surprising amount of work late game. Being able to chain GQ-Howltooth-LftL late game. Dropping more spells in the yard to fuel pike. Extra ammo for Raven's Crime. This might be more of a small pox/deathcloud tech.

* Worm Harvest? If I go the LftL route. Probably both as singletons in the board for the slower match-ups. An iffy SB addition.

* Fulminator Mage. Was kind of surprised to not see it in the board. Tron has always been big in my local meta however.

* Enaring Bridge. DRS can still get in for damage when you're in top-deck mode and a naked inkmoth can get the job done relatively quickly. Seems like it would be more effective against aggro than the 4 infest. Much of the removal is for targetted at smaller creatures; a large goyf, ascendant, wurmcoil, or boggle could be hard to deal with. 

How would you say a deck like this is positioned at the moment? What weak match-ups are you fore-seeing? What changes would you make to the maindeck/board? What experience have you had with the deck (or similar ones)?

EDIT: I'll keep a live list with changes I make below.

    5 Swamp
    4 Inkmoth Nexus
    2 Overgrown Tomb
    4 Verdant Catacombs
    4 Marsh Flats
    2 Howltooth Hollow
    1 Urborg, Tomb of Yawgmoth

    1 Life from the Loam

    SB: 1 Worm Harvest

    SB: 3 Nature's Claim
    SB: 2 Nihil Spellbomb
    SB: 1 Grafdigger's Cage
    SB: 2 Dismember

Current thoughts:

* Maelstrom Pulse vs. Abrupt Decay. I have no real out to large creatures with high cost or a resolved pod in game 1.

* Geth's verdict. Again more reach against larger creatures.

* Discard. I'm shy of thoughtseize due to its price tag. IoK I haven't touched as a 4 of but I keep varying raven's crime, duress, wrench mind and funeral charm. Currently leaning towards maxing wrench mind. Weak game 1 against affinity or tron, but otherwise nearly hymn.

* Bgw. I love lingering souls. Great lili fodder with flashback. Even if I can't find white (unlikely), lili -&gt; flashback is easy. Also opens up dropping one runechanter's for steelshaper's gift (+1 card to graveyard and opening up a equipment sideboard package). Sword of Feast and Famine seems pretty strong on a crusader.

Now, the questions we ask is why is that and will this change be permanent?

When comparing the mana from before and after Gatecrash, it is obvious that it has improved. The addition of 5 new shocks (with 2 of them being in Naya colours) is nothing to scoff at. However, with better mana, shouldn't the black splash in Naya be easier to sustain?

Here is where I think I might be wrong (I am relatively new to Naya and don't have the experience in it that other might have): Pre-Gatecrash, regular, no-splash Naya had only one shockland (in the form of Temple Garden). With no other duals in their colours, the splash for black allowed them access to Overgrown Tomb and potentially Blood Crypt. Therefore, this black splash came at a relatively minimal cost to the mana-base and gave the deck a powerful mid-game spell in Rakdos's Return as well as a greater variety of sideboard options (i.e. Rakdos's Return). Furthermore, being Farseek targets meant that the additional shock were quite easily accessible (why would you have cast Farseek for a mountain when you could have gotten a Blood Crypt instead?).

Now, this brings us to Naya in the post-Gatecrash standard. Does it need black anymore? I believe the answer is no. With 3 shocks now available to traditional Naya, the black splash is no longer necessary in order to gain access to shocks. Furthermore, the cards that the black splash gave access to are not even that great right now. Rakdos's Return is mediocre at best in the aggro-heavy format that is currently prevalent (although it does break mid-range mirrors) and Slaughter Games is sub-par for the same reasons.

Now, what I want to ask is this: do you think Naya will remain pure, 3-colour Naya or will it again develop to the dark variant? Although it is largely dictated by the direction that the metagame will take, I would still love to hear your take on the matter.",,False,,t5_2utkz,False,,,True,t3_182jt7,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/182jt7/standard_big_naya_vs_dark_naya_in_the_new_standard/,

I've recently started playing mono-U control and I really like it.  Here is my current deck list.

4 Delver of Secrets  
4 Spire Golem
 
2 Serrated Arrows

4 Counterspell  
3 Think Twice

2 Sea Gate Oracle  
3 Coast Watcher  
3 Hydroblast  
1 Deep Analysis  
2 Jace's Erasure  
1 Echoing Truth  
3 Dispel  

I feel favored in every matchup except for Cloudpost control.  I really like echoing truth over repeal vs. storm, and I really like memory lapse over miscalculation vs weenie decks.  In the cloudpost control matchup, there are four strategies that I have tried:

* Land an early delver and counter their removal until they die.  In this, I usually get them fairly low but eventually their removal is cheaper than my counterspells and they burn it dead, and then I can no longer protect from mulldrifters and eldrazi.
* Wait until I have mana then play spire golems/delvers and protect them with the remaining mana and extra cards I'll have drawn.  In this case, I just feel out-late gamed.
* Don't play creatures until I've ran them out of counterspells by fighting over mulldrifters and the like.  In this case, their removal is still waiting and I also don't have counters left over.
* Counter any 2-for-1 they have, no matter how random (evoked mulldrifters).  This just doesn't feel right, because I know there are powerful spells that I will need to fight over.

Is this just a bad matchup for me?  What are the important cards that I should be fighting over?  How soon should I try to put them on a clock?  What are good maindeck/sideboard cards vs. them?  What is bad vs. them?  Currently I'm boarding out memory lapses, echoing truths, and piracy charms for dispels and maybe Hydroblast, Erasure, and deep analysis.  I don't know if that's right though.

So I've had a modo account for quite a long time, mostly to occasionally practice draft, cube, or sometimes play Pauper, I've heard plenty of stories about people playing in a bunch of 8-4s and doing well, and essentially making a net positive enough ough of the timeto not have to pay for modo. Being a half decent player at the time, I tried an 8-4 about a year ago and got stomped. However, I tried another 8-4 today just because I had time on my hands, and it was much easier than I recalled (I 2-0'd in matches 1 and 2, then lost to a somewhat janky Cobblebrute/Pursuit of Flight deck). This got me thinking about the idea of going ""infi"" again. So my question to all of you, if any of you have experience with this, is this: what's the best way of going about going ""infi""? Is winning a bunch of 8-4s really all there is to it, or is there a better strategy? Assuming I can win enough packs in 8-4s to sell for tix to buy Standard cards, can going ""infi"" be done feasibly in Standard? What bots should I be looking at to sell packs to? Should I be selling every pack I win, or should I only be selling enough packs to have the tix I need to enter another event?",,False,,t5_2utkz,False,,,True,t3_14rr1x,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/14rr1x/mtgolimited_going_infi/,

I played his exact list from this article:

http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/woo-brews-omnidoor-thragfire/

I thought it looked hilarious and fun, so I took a break from UW Flash and tried it. To my surprise I won. And won. And won.

My matchups were:

1. Younger kid playing a not-so-great GW  deck. Kind of a free win, to be fair.

2. Good player piloting a Naya midrange deck, took it 2-1 after wrathing his guys multiple times in the ones I won.

3. Guy playing a typical Jund midrange deck. Game one he was a bit mana screwed, but game two was closer, but I curved out well and had bigger threats than he did. Took it 2-0.

4. Strange deck that basically tried to get fast wins with double striking guys with pump and protection spells. Seemed odd but he was 3-0 so it must not have been totally awful. I took game one after curving out almost perfectly into Door of Nothingness, he won game 2 on turn 4 with an 11/11 Fencing Ace, but I squeaked by game 3 by stealing his guy with Nicol Bolas and Wolf Running it for like 14.

5. My friend playing GW Aggro. Lost game one, but won the next two by playing Fog both games to prevent basically lethal damage. Game 3 was especially close, with me ripping Temporal Mastery while stuck on 3 lands to get another draw step to peel a land to Wrath.

Based on this I'm not sure if this deck is actually alright or if I just got crazy lucky. I do know that it was the most fun I've had playing magic in a long time. I got to win with Door to Nothingness four times. Four! I realise I didn't play against anyone playing counterspells, and I have a suspicion that this deck could auto-lose to a playset of Dissipate, but I'm not sure.

So I've been playing UW Draw-Go for the past couple weeks (74/75 of Adam Prosak's initial list, with an extra Supreme Verdict in the board instead of a D-Sphere) and I must say, the deck is great. Matchups like Jund, Bant, Junk, and control feel like auto-wins. That said, the deck does seem to be gaining speed, and as it does there will certainly be hate for it. I predict that anyone playing slower decks like Jund will likely pack some Cavern of Souls, but many will eschew the deck altogether for something faster. BR Zombies should also be picking up in speed.

So where does the deck go? My first predictions are adaptations to beat the mirror. It seems as though the mirror is often decided by who plays more lands and who has Cavern of Souls, so I'd imagine people going up to 24 lands and putting in a pair of Caverns is the way most people will go (and I've also seen a lot of people putting in a singleton Guildgate to offset the loss of colors, but I'm not sure how much I like that). Most of these decks take out an Unsummon for that extra slot. The other mirror tech I've seen on stream coverage for GP Bochum is Talrand, Sky Summoner. If you untap with him in the mirror, you win, no matter what. The only thing an opponent can do is Unsummon it over and over, especially if you have Cavern naming Wizard.

What also may become necessary as Zombies becomes more prevalent is to play UWr Draw-Go, splashing for Pillar and Searing Spear. This seems like it could be quite good, but in all honesty, I don't know what I would take out of the deck to add Pillar and Spear. I'm also not sure how consistent the mana base is. If anyone has a good list for this, please link it in the comments. 

The most interesting new tech I've seen is Todd Anderson's use of Jace's Phantasm. I have no idea how good it is, but it is a a cheap threat similar to to Delver that powers up as you play the deck normally. If the opponent is playing Draw-Go, it should power up VERY quickly. Is this tech here to stay, or is it more cute than effective?

The one takeaway we definitely have is that UW Flash is here to stay. It's a great deck, and I foresee it becoming tier one very quickly. Not to mention, all the Delver players from the previous Standard are going to love having this deck available to them. In the next few weeks, I advise everyone to refrain from playing a deck that you think loses to draw-go.",,False,,t5_2utkz,False,,,True,t3_13eim2,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/13eim2/standard_the_future_of_uw_flash/,

I'm ready to buy a Legacy deck, and I've got 3 choices based on my budget and the cards I have. What's your opinion on the best long-term choice out of these that will satisfy my need to win?

The choices are: Show and Tell (omniscience variant), TES/ ANT, or Goblins.

I have different concerns for each. Im worried that S&amp;T is just a fad (especially omniscience, as opposed to Sneak Attack). For ANT, I feel like Wizards is just trying to print as much storm hate as possible until the deck dies. And Goblins just seem a little narrow in that the cards in the goblin decks just don't seem to be useful in any other kind of deck (except merfolk and white weenie maybe).

Here is my biggest issue: I'm a spike, most people aren't. I come to tournaments with my own lands, sleeves, dice, everything. So foil cards aren't an issue. But I have heard that even in constructed formats, having a 1-of foil card, or just 1 or 2 cards (4-8 copies of total foils) isn't really allowed. You need some considerable amount of your deck foil or none at all, because you can feel the card before you draw it, and see the card while shuffling (if you're feeling for it). 

Here is the issue, what if the casual players at my shop don't have sleeves and only have 1 foil, their promo? Shuffling their deck is an issue (without damaging the cards), and it will be really easy for me and my opponent to tell where the one card is in their deck. I obviously never want him or her to draw this card, and he or she will always want to draw this card. What can I do about this? Can I force my opponent to use sleeves? I really want to be fair, but I also really want to win.

I played Adam Jansen’s standard Jund build.  It was similar to this one - http://sales.starcitygames.com/deckdatabase/displaydeck.php?DeckID=55876 - but with these changes:

**Main deck**
*Creatures:*
Out – 2 Sire of Insanity
In – 3 Scavenging Ooze, 1 Thundermaw Hellkite

*Planeswalkers:*
Out – 1 Liliana of the Veil 

*Lands:*
Out – 1 Cavern of Souls

*Spells:*
Out – 1 Ground Seal, 1 Tragic Slip, 2 Mizzium Mortars, 1 Rakdos Keyrune
In – 2 Pillar of Flames, 1 Rakdos’s Return, 1 Bonfire, 1 Doom Blade

**New Sideboard:**

2 Lifebane Zombie

1 Rakdos’s Return

1 Golgari Charm

3 Liliana of the Veil

1 Appetite for Brains

1 Barter in Blood

2 Vampire Nighthawk

1 Underworld Connections

1 Tragic Slip

1 Duress

1 Vraska the Unseen

I piloted the deck for the first time the night before the PTQ at FNM and this was my first time playing Jund so I was not very confident going into the tournament.  My husband plays Jund in every format and since we share cards I always end up with a different deck.  Now I understand why he likes Jund so much!  One of the biggest strengths I see with the deck is its ability to adapt and change based on your opponent.  I played terribly but I got some very valuable experience especially with the sideboard plans.  I hope you find this interesting.

Congratulations to Connor Birdsall who won the PTQ with his Naya build.

**Round 1 Me vs Steve – Mono Red Aggro**


*Game 1:* I kept a really slow hand the first game and was punished for it.  After 4 hits I was dead.


*Sideboard:*


Out – 2 radkos’s return, 1 thundermaw
In – 2 vampire nighthawk, 1 golgari charm


*Game 2:* In this game I was able to stabilize early with a hard cast bonfire and win.


*Game 3:* I lost this one due to two main factors.  I made a big mistake not mulliganing correctly.   I was on the draw and threw back my first hand.  I decided to keep a 6 that was way too slow.  I had four lands, thragtusk, and Garruk, Primal Hunter.  I was nervous to go down to 5 cards because I was just being dumb.  I continued to make this mistake for the first part of the tournament but I understand now that with this deck I need to throw back hands with nothing to do before turn 4. 

He also had 2 burning earths out so there was that.


**Round 2 Me vs Alex – GU Evolve?**


Unfortunately Alex had a deck registration error so he came to the table with 1 loss.  We started the second game without sideboarding and I won.  


**Round 3 Me vs Travis – America Control**


*Game 1:* I cast 3 farseeks and had my Thragtusk countered before I died.


*Sideboard:*


Out – 2 putrefy, 1 tragic slip, 2 bonfire, 2 pillar of flame, 1 dreadbore
In – 1 golgari charm, 1 rakdos’s return, 1 underworld connections, 1 duress, 3 liliana of the veil, 1 appetite for brains


*Game 2:* I was able to just throw out creatures to be countered until I got to resolve some threats and won this one.


*Game 3:* I lost this one due to my own hesitancy to put out Garruk.  He had a restoration angel on the field so I was hoping to deal with her by hardcasting bonfire before I put him out.  In hindsight I should have put him out, made 2 beasts and saved 6 life which would have bought me time to stabilize. 


**Round 4 Me vs Jacky – BRW Unicorns**


In the woman mirror I battled against Obzedat, Sorin who made several Unicorn (could have been horses?) emblems, and Chandra.  I was able to pull off the win in the third game during extra turns.


I sideboarded in the same manner as I would against BGW Aristocrats


Out – 2 rakdos’s returns
In – 1 golgari charm, 1 lifebane zombie


**Round 5 Me vs Luke – Jund mirror**


I was able to win this one in three games.  There was actually one pretty fantastic moment in which is probably the moment I started to love Jund.

 
I kept a hands with lands, rakdos keyrune, farseek, and rakdos’s return.  I just kept accerating until boom, discard all 6 of your cards.  


*Sideboard:*


Out – 1 abrupt decay, 1 doom blade, 1 tragic slip, 1 scavenging ooze, 2 pillar of flame
In – 1 appetite for brains, 1 vraska, 2 lifebane zombies – rockstar of the sideboard for this matchup, 1 rakdos’s return, 1 underworld connections


**Round 6 Me vs Nick – Esper Control**


*Game 1:* I learnt a hard lesson this game.  When your opponent casts Sphinx’s Revelations twice and you are basically out of threats you should just scoop and go to the next game.  I let him kill me slowly while trying to fight myself out of it.  


*Sideboard:*


Out – 1 tragic slip, 2 putrefy, 1 doom blade, 2 pillar of flame, 1 bonfire
In – 1 rakdos’s return, 1 underworld connections, 1 duress, 3 liliana, 1 appetite for brains


*Game 2:* Here I also made a huge mistake.  I had him slow-ish so I decided to hit him with damage instead of Tamiyo.  Soon after Jace came out.  With both planeswalkers live he was able to stabilize and come back to win with about a minute left in the round.


**Round 7: Me vs Scott – RBW **


For some reason I’m having trouble remembering everything that Scott was playing.  I think there were lingering souls, doomed traveler, blood artist, and Obzedat.  


I sideboarded similar to how I would for BGW aristocrats shown above.


**Round 8: Me vs Charming Bob and his Pigs for Rolling – Jund Mirror**


We rolled pigs to see who went first.  Bob won and I trust that he was following some format to score the rolls. 


The sideboard plan for the Jund mirror is shown above.


In the Jund mirror you have the ability to outplay your opponent.  If you both play optimally then it seems to just come to who draws better.


**Bant Hexproof**
I did not see Bant Hexproof which was the matchup I was the most worried about.  Here is how I would have sideboarded.


Out – 2 rakdos’s return, 1 rakdos keyrune, 2 Garrul, primal hunter, 1 thundermaw, 2 putrefy, 1 thragtusk


There are a couple more matchups that I worked out but I didn’t see.  If you’re interested in any specific ones let me know but understand they weren’t tested.

* 3rd land
* Show and Tell
* Emmerkul
* Omni
* Stuff

What would you name in the dark? In hindsight I think Show and Tell might have been correct since he only had two lands in play (at least two turns off from dream halls).

Augur is great against aggro, and the ability is nice. 4 snaps is a lot, but late game it's fantastic. The restos give value and they're another beat down source late game.

Besides him, we also have core pieces in Arbor Elf, Elvish Visionary, Yeva, Deathrite Shaman, and Elvish Archdruid; non-core pieces can include Beck, Master Biomancer, and Zameck Guildmage (if we decide to use blue), and either or both Garruks. Is this enough for the base of something competitive? I'm not sure but I'd like to try.

One thing the deck needs is some kind of protection/recovery from boardwipes and heavy removal: Ready, Gutter Grime, Beck, Urban Evolution, Garruk, Caller of Beasts, and/or Creeping Renaissance seem to be our best options. If we do use Ready, the black we're splashing for Deathrite can be used for Willing, too. We *could* go deep into three or four colours but I doubt it's worth it.

Tonight was my store's first 'official' (read:sanctioned) Modern event. While we've played before with 3-5 people, it was never really taken seriously, but we managed to scrounge up 8 today! Anyway, I went with UWR Midrange ([decklist](http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/uwr-geist-28-05-13-2/)) against the following meta: UW Merfolk, GR Tron, UW Tron, Melira Pod, 3x UWR Midrange (including me, 1 running [Romero's list with Lightning angels](http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/gppor13/welcome), one being a standard UWR list), and UB Mill. 

Anyway, since the UWR mirror is extremely skill intensive, I was wondering if anyone who has been running the deck longer than I have has any advice in general for the matchup. Typically my plan is to go: -2 Helix (both lists run snares), -1 Electrolyze, -1 Thundermaw, +1 Batterskull, +2 Counterflux, +1 SoWaP but I'm not entirely sure if that's a correct plan. I think right now I want to add another SoWaP (probably swapping a RiP or Purge) because oftentimes if I equip it it's lights out, but I'm not sure if I should be cutting another helix/electrolyze (what I instinctively want to cut).  

I'm also looking for some general decklist advice, at the moment I believe I want to swap out a plains for an Eijano castle, but beyond that I'm not entirely sure what I can/should do.

This past weekend I had the experience of playing in my first Pro Tour Qualifier with a slightly irregular Junk Rites deck. As an exercise in both writing and analysis, I'd like to share how the tournament went for me.
Here is the list I played at the PTQ:


Main:

3x Angel of Serenity

2x Arbor Elf

4x Avacyn's Pilgrim

2x Centaur Healer

2x Craterhoof Behemoth

3x Restoration Angel

3x Thragtusk


4x Grisly Salvage

3x Liliana of the Veil

3x Lingering Souls

3x Mulch

4x Unburial Rites



3x Forest

1x Gavony Township

3x Godless Shrine

2x Isolated Chapel

4x Overgrown Tomb

3x Sunpetal Grove

4x Temple Garden

4x Woodland Cemetary



Side:

3x Abrupt Decay

3x Acidic Slime

3x Deathrite Shaman

1x Obzedat, Ghost Council

3x Rhox Faithmender

2x Sever the Bloodline



A couple of notes on deck choice:


I have been playing Junk Rites for something like two months now, so despite decks like Bant Hexproof and Jund beginning to rise I decided to stick with a deck I knew well.

As you can see, this is more or less the ""old"" version of the deck - no Sin Collectors, Fiend Hunters or main deck Acidic Slimes. This is the Lingering Souls-into-Craterhoof Behemoth version. I have seen the new editions rise, but aside from a more favorable matchup in the mirror, I haven't seen the newer deck do enough to convince me to switch.

Finally, there was my last-minute edit, 3x Liliana of the Veil. Upon arriving at the site, we were informed that Bant Hexproof and Naya Midrange were ruling the top tables for the most part at Saturday's WMCQ tournament at the same site. I decided to cut 2x Lotleth Troll and a sideboard card to make room for Lili, whom I thought could really help against those relatively poor matchups. I added a 24th land, the third Godless Shrine, to make the double black a bit easier, and registered my list.


Rd. 1 vs. Javier Berrones (Mono Green)

My first round opponent was running the Predator Ooze deck, a matchup I find quite favorable. Game 1 he did not have a play until his Ooze turn 3, and Angel of Serenity wiped out his side a couple of turns later, and cleared the way for a heavy-handed win. Game 2, the Ooze dropped on turn 2, but a timely rip of Sever the Bloodline dealt with the threat and Centaur Healer and Restoration Angel both kept my life total high and created a powerful board presence, allowing me to bring down my opponent in just a few swings.

Special shout-out to Javier, who toughed it out after being down early to play the whole tournament and I believe get to a 6-3 record.

-1 Craterhoof Behemoth, -2 Lingering Souls, +1 Obzedat, Ghost Council, +2 Sever the Bloodline

2-0 Win (1-0)


Rd. 2 vs. Susan Zell (Jund)

My opponent this round was unforunately informed that she was being awarded a game loss due to a deck registration error. We shuffled up for the official game 2, and my impressive draw was not able to be overcome. Her first play was a turn 3 Vampire Nighthawk, and after swinging with it and playing Olivia on her turn 4, I untapped, brought in a Craterhoof Behemoth from the yard and bashed with some Lingering Souls tokens for 19. In a test match afterwards, I discovered that Lily can be quite effective against the deck post-sideboard, as the typical plan is to sideboard out their own Lilianas.

Susan went on to recover and end up a match away from making Top 8.

2-0 Win (2-0)


Rd. 3 vs. Andrew Baeckstrom (4C Reanimator)

My third round opponent was playing an interesting take on the deck, adding a blue splash that granted access to both Clone and Tracker's Instincts. In game 1, a bevy of fliers including Angel of Serenity allowed me to grind out a game made long by my opponent's ability to reanimate Restoration Angel several times for Thragtusk blink shenanigans. Game 2 was not much of a game, as his 4 color manabase came together too late after I generated an early Thragtusk.

-2 Craterhoof Behemoth, -1 Lingering Souls, -3 Liliana of the Veil, +3 Deathrite Shaman, +1 Obzedat, Ghost Council, +2 Sever the Bloodline

2-0 Win (3-0)


Rd. 4 vs. Justin Kanthak (Naya Mid-Middle-Range)

Justin was running a list the landed somewhere in between the Naya Blitz decks and the five-drop Naya Midrange decks. In game 1, my opponent ended up a slow draw and I was able to win the race, sealing the deal with an Angel of Serenity. Game two, he had to mulligan to 5 and was essentially forced to keep a hand of lands and Searing Spears. A Skullcrack kept my life total from getting out of hand, but his lack of board presence made this game not even close.

-2 Craterhoof Behemoth, -3 Lingering Souls, -1 Mulch, -1 Arbor Elf, +3 Abrupt Decay, +2 Rhox Faithmender, +2 Sever the Bloodline

2-0 Win (4-0)


Rd. 5 vs. Shea Strausman (Jund)

This was my second match of the day against an archetype that had been showing up in decent numbers at the top tables. Game 1 was a nail-biter, as my opponent and I played an awkward dance of known Angel of Serenity vs. known Olivia. My life total went steadily down as his rose greatly through Vampire Nighthawk and Kessig Wolf Run. Late in the game, my opponent had two unflipped Huntmasters and two wolf tokens sitting at 25 life, while I, at 6 life, had 5 lands, two mana dorks, a Lingering Souls token and an Angel of Serenity, with two more in hand. He passed the turn, and used the Huntmaster triggers to put me to 2, but chose to kill a Spirit token rather than the second mana creature. I ripped a land and slammed Angel to all but wipe his board. After attempting to stabilize with the Olivia and another creature, Angel the third sealed the deal. My memory is hazy on game 2, as my pad shows my opponent conceding at 23 life. I believe my opponent was a bit flooded, and another Angel of Serenity was going to be too much to overcome.

-2 Craterhoof Behemoth, -3 Lingering Souls, -1 Centaur Healer, +3 Acidic Slime, +1 Obzedat, Ghost Council, +2 Sever the Bloodline

2-0 Win (5-0)


Rd. 6 vs. Nick Edgerle (Junk Rites)

My opponent's Rites deck was on the Farseek plan, to avoid Bonfire of the Damned blowouts and other problematic scenarios. I curved Thragtusk into Restoration Angel game 1, and a Thragtusk of my opponent's was not enough to come back. In game two, he was in need of black mana for several turns, while my Spirit tokens and later fat creatures allowed my to push for the kill before he could stabilize.

-2 Craterhoof Behemoth, -1 Lingering Souls, -3 Liliana of the Veil, +3 Deathrite Shaman, +1 Obzedat, Ghost Council, +2 Sever the Bloodline

2-0 Win (6-0)


Rd. 7 vs. Oscar Jones (Junk Aristocrats)
I had just heard of this deck the day before when Brad Nelson was piloting it to victory in SCG Baltimore. The deck seemed to double down on Skirsdag High Priest, so I knew I wanted to keep that guy off the table. I recognized Oscar from his appearance at the MOCS earlier this year (Pyromaniac4290). Oscar kept a risky 1 lander game 1 which did not pay off as Thragtusk and friends ran over the weenie creatures. Game 2 he mulliganed to 5, but my he spilled his hand onto the table, with High Priest at the ready, and a whiffed Mulch combined with the fact that I did not see any Unburial Rites put the game squarely in his favor. In game 3, however, Centaur Healer gummed up the board early, and then the Angel of Serenity parade again proved too much for my opponent to handle.

Oscar went on to win his next match, draw into top 8 and take down the whole thing (Congratulations!).

-2 Craterhoof Behemoth, -3 Lingering Souls, -3 Liliana of the Veil, -1 Mulch, +3 Abrupt Decay, +3 Deathrite Shaman, +1 Obzedat, Ghost Council, +2 Sever the Bloodline

2-1 Win (7-0)


Rd. 8 vs. Raymond Perez Jr. (Esper Control)

As the only 7-0 players in the room, Ray and I had no need to play. A shame, because I have not been able to get much experience playing the deck against a Supreme Verdict-style list.

0-0 Draw (7-0-1)


Rd. 9 vs. Reed Hartman (Junk Rites)

After my Round 8 draw, I was a mathematical lock for the Top 8, and was encouraged to play the last round and attempt to secure the first seed. My opponent was playing a list more akin to the ""new"" version of Junk, featuring Fiend Hunter. Ten Sprit tokens off my Lingerling Souls game 1, however, proved impossible for him to deal with. In game 2, I learned of the power of Garruk Relentless in the mirror, as he ate my mana dork and eventually tutored up a game-winning Craterhoof Behemoth. After game 2, for whatever reason, I decided to offer my opponent the draw he desired.

-2 Craterhoof Behemoth, -3 Lingering Souls, -3 Liliana of the Veil, -1 Centaur Healer, +3 Acidic Slime, +3 Deathrite Shaman, +1 Obzedat, Ghost Council, +2 Sever the Bloodline

1-1 Draw (7-0-2)


Rd. Top 8 vs. Reed Hartman (Junk Rites)

My decision to draw came back to bite me as I was paired against my Round 9 opponent in the 3 vs. 6 matchup. I kept a questionably slow hand of 7 in game 1, which was punished by his repeated Acidic Slimes. In game 2, I was forced to mulligan to 5 and keep 4 lands and an Avacyn's Pilgrim and a Lingering Souls off the top was one of very few spells I managed to draw before being beaten down by a horde of fat creatures.

I readjusted my sideboard plan after Round 9, figuring Lingering Souls may actually be one of my advantages over his version of the decks.

-1 Craterhoof Behemoth, -3 Liliana of the Veil, -2 Centaur Healer, -1 Mulch, +2 Acidic Slime, +3 Deathrite Shaman, +2 Sever the Bloodline

0-2 Loss (7-1-2)



While I left with a bit of a bad taste in my mouth, I learned quite a bit from the experience and won a box of Dragon's Maze to boot (no Voice of Resurgence *sniff*). As for the deck, it felt like the most powerful in the room, and I think the move to Liliana was actually quite helpful. It also reinforced my knowledge that Angel of Serenity is just a crazy good card, and I will likely be finding a way to wedge in a fourth. As well as make room for a Garruk Relentless or two to help in the mirror.

Also see, Orim's Chant (but it targets, and many combo decks side in Leyline Sanctity)

With the rise of fast combo decks like Tin Fins and more established decks like Belcher, Ad Naseum, and modern similarities (old Storm, play in response to Cascade which would hit Living End), non-blue decks often have a horrible time of answering these matchups.

I see Silence get used in Tin Fins a lot as a protective measure, but why doesn't Silence find use against combo decks?

The way I see it, Silence can be used as a counterspell against these ritual/pseudo storm decks to halt them mid combo (in response to Entomb, or in response to Burning Wish plus LED Crack).  It does require precision timing and knowledge of the meta but can cripple a deck that expended many resources to get to the killing point.

Additionally, it can act as a partial Time Walk to allow you to play more effective hate such as DRS, Thalia, or Ethersworn Canonist the next turn - a feature which translates to control matchups such as Miracles, where an EOT Sensei's activation for a Miracled Entreat can be nullified.

[Edit: Silence can stop the opponent from casting the revealed Miracle card if you cast it in response to the trigger]

I am looking opinions on the roles these two similarly colored/costed cards have in top tier decks. I am having trouble deciding what decks each should go in with DGM becoming standard legal this weekend. 

Blood Baron is less color intensive. non-legendary, more resilient to removal, and conditionally evasive. This is at the cost of being a 4/4 instead of 5/5 and not guarantee'ing a life swing,

On offensive, wiith Obzedat you get a 5/5 attacker that handily kills most format staples 1:1 (except Thragtusk which is a trade) and a choice for a 4 life swing or a vanilla 5/5 blocker. Obzedat affects the field immediately, and in most offensive cases again at the start of the next turn netting a 8 life swing prior to the first attack opportunity. With Blood Baron you have a 2 color pro 4/4 lifelink blocker that does nothing until next turn unless you are attacked. If it does swing and connect you've accomplished less life swing in 2 turns versus Obzedat (8 life swing, 5 damage if he connects).

On defense Obzedat loses utility whereas Blood Baron is able to either trade or kill an attacker while gaining you life. The problem with both is a lack of flying so Olivia, Falkenwrath Aristocrat, and Lingering Souls tokens fly on by. 

I'm not really sure whether Blood Baron is going to replace Obzedat in some lists so much as he will appear as a new tool in others where Obzedat hadn't been a good fit before.

I feel like this deck has a lot of room to grow and a lot of variation and innovation left in it, so I've been pondering cards that may see an inclusion in lists. (Sorry, I can't link any of these cards in mobile.)

First off, Pit Fight. Other than Pongify this is our only real removal spell in these colors. It works fantastic with our Dryad but is it too reliant on our other cards in order to be effective. Also it seems like an interesting sideboard card but when do you side it in? Against aggro where all their guys just bounce off Quirion Dryad? The fight mechanic is also a bit awkward since it has the potential to backfire more so than traditional removal depending on what your opponent has up his/her sleeve.

Secondly, Bioshift. This card seems more than anything like just a cute interaction with the Dryad, but it can be a way to push large amounts of damage through with a flipped Delver. Quirion Dryad suffers from being chump blocked all day, and this is a way to fight that. Again though, is it too dependent on our other cards to truly be worth considering?

And then there is Hydroform. Using our lands as blockers or a way to push damage through seems pretty good. It is more of a three mana spell than a two mana one but I feel like that isn't all that relevant. The biggest concern is that the deck plays so few lands so is it worth potentially losing our precious lands? Also, is it any better than any of the other cards the deck has in it? My instinct tells me that it isn't. Regardless the 3/3 Flying body at instant speed seems pretty good to take people by surprise.

Lastly, Rancor. Being an enchantment makes this card inherently awkward within the deck, but it would be replacing Runechanter's Pike, which suffers a very similar fate. At only one mana it certainly looks appealing, but is the trample more valuable than the first strike Pike gives? Does Pike make our Spell Rupture that much better than Rancor does?

Naya has been quietly placing in most of the standard events for the past month while falling off everyone's radar. How well placed is it right now?

Naya has always had the problem of awkward draws that don't do much of anything until turn 4, and with Naya Blitz trying hard to be public enemy #1 again there are just too many decks that will punish those sorts of keeps. The pre-GTC Naya mirrors were often decided by who 1) had Farseek on turn 2 or 2) who miracle'd Bonfire/played Wolf Run first. It's a deck that wants to take advantage of the value provided by its creatures by playing them and maybe transforming them or blinking them. Blitz won't let you get that value, and Reanimator just gets way more value with its four Angels of Serenity.

Naya Midrange isn't well suited to going ""under"" anything like Blitz is, so it seems our primary concerns are putting a giant roadblock in front of the aggro decks and going *through* Reanimator. Thragtusk is only kind of suited to one of these goals, and indeed many of the Naya midrange decks that have placed recently are running 0 copies of the beast. I don't think 0 Thragtusk and 4 Restoration Angel is necessarily correct, but 4 Thraggies doesn't seem right either. If we're going to go through Reanimator, which is rocking beasts and angels themselves, then we want our 5-drops to be winning the game instead of trying to help us gain an incremental advantage.

Thundermaw Hellkite and Zealous Conscripts seem well suited to this. At least, much more suited to it than my personal pet 5-drop for Naya, Sigarda. Loxodon Smiter and Boros Reckoner also let us have plays on turn 2-3 that at least keep us alive against the Blitz nut-draw.

Something thing I've noticed is the absence on Bonfire in these lists for Mortars. I haven't tested much with Mortars, but can anyone testify to its pros/cons?  Also, Selesnya Charm seems like a pretty good card to be running nowadays. All three modes of it seem relevant in the meta right now.

This is where I'm at right now. The sideboard is a mess because I've been changing it constantly. What does r/spikes think? Does this deck have the potential to actually win a major tournament as opposed to sneaking into the top 8/16?

",16,4,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/1akzx4/standard_junk_reanimator/,"
I'm decided to play Junk (GWB) Reanimator. 

You've got a powerful reanimator strategy that can effectively fight the control decks and goes over the top of most other decks. You also can be a powerful midrange deck. 

The hate cards do very little to you. Unlike Human Reanimator, you can actually easily win a game through Rest in Peace. You can completely blank the card if you want to- it's reasonable to side out your Unburial Rites in certain matchups. I've sided out Rites against an aggressive deck, only to have them play turn 1 Grafdigger's Cage into turn 2 Rest in Peace. They may as well have mulliganed to five. 

I wanted to discuss the deck, and there are still a few questions that I have: 

**Martin Juza's deck or Sam Black's?**

[Juza played this list at GP Verona](http://www.wizards.com/magic/samplehand.asp?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/gpver13/day2&amp;decknum=7). [Sam Black played this](http://www.wizards.com/magic/samplehand.asp?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/gpver13/day2&amp;decknum=8) (I believe Sperling is credited with the build). They're pretty different, and most junk reanimator lists can be categorized as being like one or the other. 

I like Sam Black's list for quite a few reasons

* Playing a bunch of Elves is bad against various wrath effects. You also have to play a bunch of Forests, which hurts your ability to cast cards like Obzedat. 
* Centaur Healer is not a powerful card. It doesn't match up well against a lot of the aggressive threats. If they have Flinthoof Boar or Searing Spear or Loxodon Smiter or Boros Reckoner, it's simply not impressive. It does work well in concert with Rhox Faithmender and Restoration Angel. 
* Lotleth Troll and Lingering Souls are sweet cards that do powerful things. The latter also increases the value of Mulch and Grisly Salvage by a lot. 

But there's a counterpoint: 

* Juza's list a lot more explosive. Lots of elves makes you much faster. 
* Lingering Souls doesn't really block much. All the aggressive creatures are good against it. 
* Restoration Angel is a powerful card, and you have a lot of synergy with it. 
* Centaur Healer is a good way to fight against the aggressive decks. 

So which one would you play, and why? 

**When am I actually supposed to side out Unburial Rites?** 

I feel like I might be siding out the card too often in my testing. I think I almost always cut at least one of them after board (except against the control decks, where getting an early Angel/Craterhoof is the easiest route to victory). 

Generally, when I take them all out, I'll also take out Mulch and Craterhoof Behemoth. This seems to be the plan against most of the aggressive decks, but I'm not sure if it's right. Do I want to side out a land when I'm doing this? 

How should I be sideboarding? 

**Which sideboard cards are the right ones?** 

Deathrite Shaman is the obvious choice against the other Reanimator decks, and going forward it seems like you want 3-4. Obzedat seems to be a mainstay as well, generally appearing as a 2 of. 

Is Loxodon Smiter better post-board than Centaur Healer? 

Against the aggressive decks, the first Blind Obedience looks sweet (not losing randomly to Hellrider/Thundermaw/Aurelia is nice). Rhox Faithmender from Sam's deck confuses me. It seems like Restoration Angel would be better in that slot, since the only interaction Sam has with the Faithmender is Faithmender -&gt; Thragtusk. Angel does the same thing, but seems to have additional value in killing things like Hellrider. 

What do I want to be siding in against control decks? My choices are likely Duress, Cavern of Souls, and Acidic Slime. What should the split look like? 

**Why shouldn't I play this deck?** 

What am I missing? Where are my bad matchups? It seems like the aggro matchups might be hard, but you have access to things like Restoration Angel + Thragtusk, so that might not even be true if you can survive.

**Match 1: Splinter-twin**

**Game 1**: I mulled down to 6 after a one land hand. I lost the die roll... and he proceeded to land a turn-3 flash in Pestermite into a turn-4 Splinter-twin. +2 spellskite, +2 Ghostly Prison, +2 Path, -3 Oust, -2 Baterskull, -1 Wall of Omens.

**Game two**, he landed a blood moon turn 3 while I had a two non-basics, a plains in play, and a island in hand. Fortunately, I drew into a spreading seas, which allowed me to land Jace... leading into a ghostly prison, and a quick scoop from there.

**Game three**, he morphed into a jund deck, which really took me by surprise, landing goyfs turn 2 and 3. I top-decked into a d-sphere, and got a 2-for one. Spreading Seas his Manlands, and then Elspeth then went to work. 

**1-0**

**Match 2**: UW Control

**G1**: This... honestly was just a bit of a blur to me. I won game 1 by beating in with Eslpeth's Soldier tokens, Batterskull on a lingering souls token, and a colonnade, while pathing his Angel, tec-edge his colonnade, just getting better draws. -3 Wall of Omens, -1 Wrath, +1 Verdict, +1 Meddling Mage, +2 Mindcensor.

**Game 2**: Early Geist of St. Traft + Clique took the verdict I had in hand. Lingering souls became chump blockers, and he eventually won.

**Game 3**: Opening hand had 2 verdicts, and I drew into a third. We both answered each other's threats. When I was about to swing in for lethal with colonnade, he Sphinx'ed for 6. Then answered my colonnade and beat my Elspeth to death. Then, we went to turns. He Sphinx'ed again for 8, right after I drew into a batterskull. We then proceeded to tie.

**1-0-1**

**Match 3: Jund**

**Game 1**: On the draw, he inquisitioned my Wall of Omens away (only legal target). Drew into multiple spreading seas, shutting down his entire manabase.  Beat him to death with Gideon and Elspeth. +1 Verdict, +1 Meddling Mage, -1 Gideon, -1 D-sphere.
	
**Game 2**: Early Treetop Village went far. Then he dropped a thrun, which I had to rely on my one of wrath for... which I didn’t draw. Treetop and Thrun went a loooooong way.

**Game 3**:  Ousted a t-1 deathrite. Dsphere his goyf. Wall of Omens kept + Jace’s +1 Ability kept him from killing me. Inquisition took a Lingering Souls, and saw a wrath of god. He was apparently waiting for me to drop wrath before he dropped Thrun. Unfortunately, souls blocked threats, and I drew into verdicts to kill them. We went to time.

**1-0-2**

**Game 4:  Affinity**

**G1**: He won the dice roll.. which won him the game. T1- Blinkmoth, signal pest, springleaf drum, ornithropter, memnite memnite, second signal pest. I... uh... ousted one, and attempted to stall until I could wrath. He got me to 8, then killed me with double Galvanic Blast (his turn 3 and 4 draws). +2 Stony Silence, +2 Ghostly Prison, -2 Batterskull, +1 Verdict, -2 Talisman of Progress, and I forgot what else I took out.

**G2**: T2 Stony Silence, into T3 Ghostly Prison stalled him long enough for me to spreading seas all his coloured lands, and drop Gideon and Jace.

**G3**: Hit a T3 Ghostly Prison and a t4 Wrath. Won with spirit token + Elspeth beats. 

**2-0-2**

**Match 5: Tron**

This was the matchup I was definitely ready for. I've playtested primarily against Tron, Melira-pod, and Jund, and find that I win Tron 80% of the time.

**G1**- Spreading seas and Tec-edges did so much work it was ridiculous. He didn’t even get to 5 lands, much less tron. +2 Mindcensor, +1 Meddling mage, +2 Path to Exile, -2 Verdict, -1 Wrath, -1 Wall of Omens,  -1 Jace.

**G**2- He must have had a nuts hand, because, for every urza land I hit, he seemed to have two more. I had to path a wurmcoil, which gave him the lands to Karn. Following which, I scooped.

**G3**- Similar to game 1. Spreading seas did work, then proceeded to prevent him from getting the mana to pop o-stone with Three tec-edge off the top. He scooped at the Elspeth Ulti, followed by a second Elspeth. 

**3-0-2**

**Match 6**: Team America

**G1**- Geist ran rampant on me. Really couldn’t deal. Lingering Souls took out one, after I got hit once, but he just cast another. Then he countered the flashback. +1 Verdict, -3 Oust, +2 Path, -3 Sphere, +3 Rest in Peace.

**G2**- Opening hand had two verdicts. Thankfully, he didn’t clique, and I got rid of two Geists. Then beat him to death with spirit tokens. 

**G3**- Misplay on my part (Tapping for the wrong threat. Leaving Tec-edge open for Colonnade) prevented me from flashing back lingering souls to act as a blocker. When I was at 6, he resto on a snapcaster bolting me, then beating me down for 3. I attempted to path, but he counterfluxed. There, I thought I misplayed, thinking I should have pathed the snapcaster in response to the angel being cast, but I realize now that, if I had done that, he would have colonade mana, and I’d be dead. 

**3-1-2**

**Match 7**: Some weird GWrb zoo deck. 

**G1**- Had to mulligan to 5 due to lands. Couldn’t deal with turn-2 Loxodon Smiter, turn 4 Baneslayer. +2 Path to Exile, +1 Verdict, -1 Spreading Seas, -1 Gideon, -1 Jace.

**G2**- Two wraths in a row killed Baneslayer, Smiters, and a whole gaggle of deathrites. Path cleared the way for everything else, and I proceeded to just flat out with with Elspeth and Batterskull. 

**G3** – Almost went to time, but early wraths + two lingering soul topdecks + pathing his angel got me the win. 

**4-1-2**

**Match 8: Kiki-pod**

**G1**: I haven’t really playtested against kiki-pod, only Melira pod. He won the die roll, and went off turn 3 before I could even blink. +2 Mindcensor, +2 Ghostly Prison, +2 Path to Exile, -2 Oust, +1 Verdict, -1 Elspeth.

**G2**: Mulled to 5, but managed to land Jace. +1 Made his infinite Exarchs swing for 0. I attempted to find a wrath or ghostly prison with Jace’s -2, which got me a Gideon... which he proceeded to steal and combo off the next turn by dropping a Zealous Conscripts. Infinite Conscripts + Steal Gideon means I die. 

**Final Score: 4-2-2**

**What I learned about the deck**: I have a terrible matchup against any decks that can combo off turn 3. I'm probably going to take out the wall of Omens for Snapcasters, and actually put countermagic in the 75. I honestly didn't expect my deck to do as well as it did, but it seems like, against the current meta, Superfriends control does some damn good work. I just need to learn to pilot it better.

**What I learned about events**: I need to bring water and food to these large events, because I went practically the entire day without drinking a sip of water, or having a bite to eat. I also learned that I'm honestly unsure about playing control now. Grinding 8 games, almost all of which reached turns, is an absolutely nerve-wracking experience.

I'm still a bit jittery.

4-2-2. Not too terrible for my first major event. Definitely could have done better though. I consoled myself with picking up cards to pimp out my EDH deck with. 

I'm now going to collapse.

I only started playing last year RTR PR, I performed poorly with 1-4-1 but even before PR I did have some kitchen table basics with modern decks I borrowed from a friend.

My understanding is very limited but I'm really interested in learning difference between Aggro and Tempo. I've read up some articles and I end up with this following conclusion.

If i'm running a tempo deck it's going to play out somewhat like this:
Me: Drop land, play 1/1
Him: Drop land, play 2/2
Me: Drop land, bounce his 2/2, play another 1/1, attack with a 1/1
Him: Drop land, play 3/3
Me: Drop land, bounce, rinse, repeat

To me, the objective of tempo is literally to get board advantage at a relatively short time, even at the expense of having card disadvantage long term. I'm seeing it as close to pure Aggro but with provisions for a bit of control play but not necessarily departing from what beating down should be. Like if there's an untapped creature and there's no blockers, there's no reason not to attack. 

I understand that I could be wrong and misguided, and I'm sure there's a lot more to that than just clearing the board and beating down. I can't come up with a specific example right now but I hope you get the drift. I'm asking because I'm thinking of running Tempo G/U instead of my G/W aggro instead. I'm hoping to be able to use some existing parts but I'm really wanting to get better at this and I'm open to new suggestions if I need to drop the whole idea and pursue a different one.

It's consistent, has very few bad matchups due to hatebears, and has free-win potential.  
Here's the list:

The issue I'm having is that I feel the the meta is going to be mostly Jund, Emissary Aggro, or UWR.  My version of Naya humans is fairly resilient and less gimmicky than blitz, but despite that I'm still &lt;50% against Jund which is probably the most popular deck right now.

I piloted Bant Hexproof with some success for several months, even before it was popular and won a GP.  I feel like the meta going into SCG Las Vegas is extremely soft to Bant Hexproof - it's just as fast as Naya Blitz and can't be stopped by removal spam.  Jund and Reanimator are usually free wins, with poor matchups against Esper/Bant control and above 50% against most aggro.

1359947584.0,13,self.spikes,17uf47,[Constructed] Building a Deck with Math,18,5,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/17uf47/constructed_building_a_deck_with_math/,"Hello everyone!

Far too often, I see people debating the construction of any given deck. ""There's no way you'll ever draw all those cards at the same time!"" ""That deck definitely doesn't run enough black mana sources."" ""That Augur of Bolas will never hit a spell in that list."" People eyeball and guess about numbers in a list all the time, and back up those numbers with a very small sample size of games. I've seen this leads to some ridiculous conclusions over the years, like ""9 white sources is plenty to cast these Supreme Verdicts on turn 4 consistently!"" or ""Pauper Infect can win on turn 2 four out of every five games."" Well, now is the time to find an objective answer to these questions of consistency with some probability.

Firstly, why would one use math in deckbuilding? Doesn't that sort of take the spirit out of brewing? A pinch of this, a pinch of that, try a couple of these, see if this works, etc, has been the preferred method of deckbuilding since the game's inception. Well, the fact is that you don't really need to use this technique every time you set out to add lands to your deck, or every time you add Augur of Bolas to your deck. From playing for a good period of time, many of you Spikes already have a strong intuition of what's good and bad in terms of numbers in decks. I offer this strategy not to replace your intuition, but to compliment it, and help assure it. Are you not sure you have enough black to cast Liliana of the Veil on turn 3 consistently? If you really want to check your intuition, you can find the exact probability of having two or more black sources in your deck by turn 3. 

Now, before we go any further, I must warn you: this is a VERY dry read. If you aren't too fond of math, skip over the rest and go down to the TL;DR at the bottom. Otherwise, read on.
So, down to the math. The probability technique I use for this is called a Hypergeometric Distribution. Basically, it asks the question, ""For n many attempts without replacement, in a population size N, with K possible successes, what is the likelihood that there will be k successes and n-k failures?"" Or, in Magic terms, ""If I draw n cards, with N cards in my deck, and K of the card I'm looking for, what is the probability I will draw k of them?"" For example, if I wanted to know how likely it was I would be able tap for double black on the play with no mulligans and 14 black sources in my deck, N would be 60, n would be 9, K would be 14, and k is every value from 2 to 9 (you'd have to do the hypergeometric distribution for each k value and add them up). Now, if you want to know exactly how to do a hypergeometric distribution, you can watch an excellent tutorial [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCeFgnh6A1U). however, I HIGHLY SUGGEST YOU DON'T DO THIS BY HAND!!! It will take you forever, it is incredibly boring, and there is a much better option. Head down to [Wolframalpha.com](http://www.wolframalpha.com/) and type ""hyergeometricdistribution[n, K, N]"" with the appropriate n, K, and N values. Then, head down to where it says, ""Plot of PDF"" and click ""show table of values"". The numbers correspond to how many hits of the card you're looking for and what the percent chance is of getting exactly that number of hits. So, to use the double black with 14 sources on the play example I talked about before, you'd go to wolframalpha, type ""hypergeometricdistribution[9, 14, 60]"" and hit enter, and then I'd add up all the values in the table by the graph where ""x"" (k) is 2 or greater.

TL;DR: Hypergeometric distributions on wolframalpha make calculating likelihoods of events occurring in Magic much easier, and as a result make an excellent aid to your own intuition when building a deck. Just go to Wolfram Alpha, and type ""hypergeometricdistribution[n, K, N]"", where n is the number of cards drawn over the whole course of the event you're calculating, K is the number of possible hits in the deck, and N is the number of cards in the entire deck. Go down to ""Plot of PDF"", click ""show table of values"", and add up all the probability values of the number of successes you're looking for or greater.",,False,,t5_2utkz,False,,,True,t3_17uf47,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/17uf47/constructed_building_a_deck_with_math/,

At the time, counterspells were being played more, so I built a deck that could take advantage of that in CoS and Faith's Shield, but now it seems that countermagic is on the backburner, at least at my local shops, and that might make the relevance of this deck less potent.

First off, I was hoping for some hard critique on this, given the current meta, and how likely I am to see unfavorable matchups, and second, I'd like a bit of insight on where I could go with this (or aggro in general) that might be better.

Apparently, the creature post damage but at End of Combat is still considered ""Attacking"" and is not just a ""Tapped Creature"" like I had assumed. Making it a viable Ith target. They had a judge called, floor judge said nope, doesn't work. They appealed and head judge said yup, totally works.

TL;DR - Maze of Ith stops your opponent from poking you with a creature and gives one of your creatures ""vigilance"" :-P",,False,,t5_2utkz,False,,,True,t3_zbpsw,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/zbpsw/learned_a_new_trick_with_maze_of_ith/,

I've been playing UWR Flash for the last couple weeks starting with the Matt Costa list and eventually evolving to playing a hybrid of the Dave Shiels and Gerry T Invitational lists (here is the Shiels list for reference: [UWR Flash] (http://sales.starcitygames.com//deckdatabase/displaydeck.php?DeckID=57830)). Now, the one thing these lists have in common is that they do not have any maindecked haymakers that could close out a game (e.g. Aetherling or Thundermaw Hellkite), leaving you to try to finish off your opponents game 1 with your Restoration Angels and burn.

After playing a few Game 1 mirror matches, I've noticed that my deck simply can't efficiently close out the game. This could be due to a couple of factors:


+ The first is that my utility lands are not optimized for the mirror. Right now, my list runs 1 Ghost Quarter and 1 Desolate Lighthouse in the utility land slots. In the games I played, my opponent had Moorland Haunt instead of Lighthouse in one of the slots. Throughout the games, even though I was filtering through my deck with Lighthouse, I found that Moorland Haunt was generating him a continuous board presence that was tough for me to deal with. The damage his spirits would get in or prevent (by blocking Resto) was extremely significant.



- The second would be that I was using my counterspells in the wrong way. Throughout the game, I was holding my counterspells in anticipation of a counterspell war in the case that one of us tried to resolve a Sphinx's Revelation. Meanwhile, I found that my Restoration Angels and Snapcasters were being slain by his burn spells and getting in little to no damage.

So my question to /r/spikes is this: as a UWR player, how should I handle the Game 1 mirror? What should I be using my counterspells for and what should my priorities be?

4 Predator Ooze

4 Wolfir Silverheart

Enchantments
4 Rancor

3 Ranger's Guile

Planeswalkers
1 Garruk, Caller of Beasts
1 Garruk Relentless

4 Revenge of the Hunted

Basic Lands
18 Forest

4 Mutavault

Sideboard:
3 Scavenging Ooze
3 Thragtusk
3 Kalonian Hydra
1 Primeval Bounty
2 Naturalize
1 Garruk Relentless
1 Witchbane Orb
1 Ulvenwald Tracker

Couple things about the deck I like:
1.) This deck is very explosive. More on that in a bit.
2.) People forgot about Rancor the way they Forgot about Dre. 
3.) It's got predator ooze in it. 

The one thing I don't like about this version of the deck.
1.) It's soft to blood artist.

Round 1: Fight!

G/b OOZE..

In Round one I played against someone who was very excited to be playing Magic. He was so excited that he kept talking about the decisions he was making out loud. I won the die roll and played t2 Ooze t3, miracle revenge of the hunted rancor rancor... Game 2 was the same.

2-0 Games.

Round 2 Fight!

Jasper Johnson-Epstein playing Jund

Game one 

Jasper played like shit and knew it. Going into the final turn of the game Jasper was at 5, and I was at 7. My board consisted of a 6/4 rancored predator ooze, four lands. a Garruk Relentless and a wolf. Ooze had just attacked him to 5

Jasper's board was Huntmaster, wolf, 3/3 beast, and an arbor elf. He cast a garruk, primal hunter off the top and cashed it in for 3 cards. He did some math and rakdos's returned me for 2 tapping the arbor elf putting me to 5, and attacked me proudly with his beast, his wolf, and his huntmaster. Proclaiming me dead and starting to pack his things up. I blocked his beast with my wolf and said ""I'll take 4 and go to 1"" Jasper had been looking at the wrong life total when he started his turn and thought I was at 5 before the return."" 

Jasper is a very good player, but he got cocky and didn't check the facts. 

game 2 he crushed me, game 3 I had the nuts.

2-1, 2-0

Round 3
U/W/R

You know what is awesome against supreme verdict? Indestructable trampling monsters. You know what is awesome against U/W/R? This deck. 

2-0, 3-0

Round 4

Mono Red

The reason we played this deck when zombies and hellrider decks were good was because this deck is a bitch to attack into. Nice legion loyalist...

2-0, 4-0

After I started 4-0 and Lukas﻿ and Court﻿ had long since died, they asked to look at the deck and they asked why I put Kalonian Hydra in the Board. I responded with ""I really didn't like wolfir avenger, so I switched them."" I honestly loved the change. This is never a deck where you keep up 3 mana. Doing so gives your opponent information they really don't give a shit about. If you really think representing wolfir avenger is a strong play, you have your priorities fucked. You are representing a 3/3 not named olivia voldaren. Cast the Hydra, and attack with it once. You'll feel much better about yourself. 

Round 5

Mother-fuckin Blood Artist deck.

0-2, 4-1

Round 6

Blood Artist: The sequel. 

This Match... was more painful than watching Twilight with Kristen Stewart. 

I lost because I am bad and should feel bad. Valuable lesson to learn here. When trying to get your opponent dead, attack with all your creatures. Failing to do so could result in your demise.

1-2, 4-2

Round 7

Naya

I played against a Naya player. He was not prepared for turn four of our game two. 

Let's have a little conversation about primeval bounty. This card is fucking bonkers. It's never a bad thing to have in play. Only good things happen to you. It's what magical christmas land actually looks like. 

On the Draw
One: Forest, Elf
Two: Mutavault, Archdruid.
Three: Mutavault, Archdruid, Mystic

Four: Activate Mutavaults, Tap druids for 10 Mana Cast Bounty Play a land (Gain 3)
Cast Hydra, Cast Scavenging Ooze, Cast Rancor. 

Board after, 2 3/3 beast, Hydra, 4 3/3 Elves, Kalonian Hydra, Scavenging Ooze with Rancor and 3 +1/+1 Counters. 2 4/4 Mutavaults. Bounty... The quicker-picker-upper. My opponent had a loxodon smiter.

2-0, 5-2

Round 8

Junk Tokens

My opponent was busy casting lingering souls and I was casting resilient threats and then enchanting them with the popeye like powers of rancor. 

This list is sweet, and I would definitely recommend this. 

There has also been some discussion about adding another color to this deck. Right now I like the mono green deck. I would cut new Garruk from this deck and replace him with another Relentless. I would give serious thought to changing the sideboard. 

The different color options are white and red. 

White: Rest in Peace and Unflinching Courage have been suggested. Ray of revelation is also under consideration. 

Red: Domri Rade and Bonfire of the Damned. Predator Ooze and Domri seems sweet. Other card to consider, Huntmaster and Ogre Battle Driver.

Advantages of ooze over voice are:  
1. Ooze punishes graveyard interactions.   
2. Wins the mirror more handily than voice.  
3. Is easier to cast.  
4. Does more later into the game.

Advantages of voice over ooze are:

But what happens when M14 shakes things up?  
  
Simple - Keep playing the deck.  
  
Junk 'Crats gets some new goodies that we can explore and abuse:  
  
1.  Archangel of Thune - With all of the Blood Artist triggers we have throughout a game, Archangel can give our creatures even more defensive (and attacking) power while draining our opponent.  I'm pretty sure this angel replaces Obzedat as the 1-of of choice in most decks, simply because of this ability.  Additionally, a reliable tutor target for the dark side of Garruk is nothing to scoff at.  
  
2. Xathrid Necromancer - I'm not sure just *how* great he will be in the deck, but I feel like he's a solid replacement for Young Wolf.  He is a strong card against board sweepers, which, with Supreme Verdict, Bonfire of the Damned, and now Ratchet Bomb joining the party, this deck needs.  I would play 2.  My only hesitation is that it reduces our number of early drops against Aggro, particularly on the draw.  
  
3.  Scavenging Ooze - No 4-of by any means, but a great sideboard candidate alongside Deathrite Shaman.  We'll see where the direction of Reanimator goes.  Right now I'm not playing any (keeping 4 Deathrite Shaman), but it is certainly worthy of inclusion.  
  
4.  Disciple of Bolas - not a new goodie, but its interactions with Archangel of Thune, while potentially cute, could catch an opponent off guard, while giving us value through Blood Artist triggers.  With 2 Blood Artists, an Archangel of Thune, and a Disciple out, we give ourselves 3 lifegain events through Disciple's ""Sacrifice another creature"" trigger, which is insane, IMO.  Add to that the X cards we would draw, and I think he may be worth inclusion.  A wait and see, but I'm trying it, at a minimum, at FNM.  
  
With that, I present [my current take on the Aristocrats](http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/thune-and-the-aristocrats/).  I know the deck should worry about Ratchet Bomb, but we have tools available to not only survive that line of play, but actually take advantage of it now, given the right line of play on our part.  
  
Feel free to chime in with your thoughts!  I would go on and talk about matchups, but as Junk 'Crats is already an established tier-1 strategy, I don't want to sound redundant - most of us know the good and bad of the deck.  However, the ability to survive sweepers is a nice new feature to have (without sacrificing everything in response and restarting from scratch).

Tormod's Crypt/Groundseal: A lot of gruul aggro decks run these in the sideboard and I don't exactly understand it. Don't these slow you down too much against reanimator?

Let's say our deck has 24 instants/sorceries in it, including Uncovered Clues (this is a pretty high amount, but I wanted to look at an opportunity where this could be good). This means that if we have one in our hand, the probability of the top card on our deck of being an instant/sorcery is 23/59, or close to 39%. If we assume that each card revealed does not change the probability of revealing an instant/sorcery (it won't change it *that* much), then this is the odds of the amount of cards we'll ~~draw~~ **be able to choose from** with this spell:

* Exactly 0 cards: 13.8%
* Exactly 1 card: 35.2%
* Exactly 2 cards: 33.6%
* Exactly 3 cards: 14.4%
* Exactly 4 cards: 2.3%

Looking at the table, this card has a 49% chance of only replacing itself - or worse. That's the bad part. The good part is, 51% of the time we're getting 2 ~~or more~~ cards - and not just cards, but actual spells.

This can be a bad thing, too: if it's the early game and we need to hit a land drop, Uncovered Clues would only send them all to the bottom of the library.

All of the above considered, I think I'd rather run 4x Augur of Bolas before even considering any amount of Uncovered Clues. The potential to whiff or cantrip is too high for my liking, and at least Augur of Bolas leaves a body behind (not to mention coming down on turn 2)

I've been playing this UWr list ([here](http://mtgtop8.com/event?e=4819&amp;d=227852)) for the past week or so in preparation for the event.

I've been having issues with figuring out what to run in the sideboard. I've been thinking of going +1 Assemble the Legion, +1 Electrickery, +1 Angel of Serenity, -2 Izzet Staticaster, -1 Counterflux. Although depending on how widely Aristocrats is going to show up, Staticaster may not be a good cut.

A few notes on the list that I've noticed so far.

Electrickery has been surprisingly good, especially against Junk Rites. I'm never disappointed to draw it and kill all their mana dorks and spirits.

Pillar of Flame has been underwhelming at sorcery speed. Pretty much the only thing it's killed has been mana dorks turn 1 on the draw. However I'm not sure what I'd replace it with. Perhaps +1 Mizzium Mortars, +1 Searing Spear, -2 Pillar of Flame?

Izzet Charm doesn't seem to have much of an impact most games, looting doesn't feel good, and 2 damage to a creature for UR is not spectacular.

From what I've taken from playtesting so far:

Naya Blitz: the matchup is pretty good even pre-board. Lots of burn to keep their creatures off, and Snapcaster can be an Ambush Viper in a pinch

Junk Rites: this matchup doesn't seem too bad with Dissipate on their Unburial Rites or Angels and post-sideboard Clone for Angels or Thragtusks.

Aristocrats: I haven't gotten to play a ton of matches against this deck, but it seems like it could be a problem. Cavern of Souls into Falkenrath Aristocrat doesn't feel good. Paying 2 or 3 burn spells to kill one creature is not fun. It's the reason that I'm doubtful of taking Staticaster out of the board.

I haven't gotten to play against many other decks, but most other midrange matchups I'd hope would fare similarly to the Junk Rites matchup.

Games with Esper Control are often too long and result in draws, so I'd rather pilot an aggro deck. While R/G Aggro or Experiment Jund are fairly well positioned of the meta, I still can't stop thinking about taking good old B/r Zombies with me, probably something along [these lines](http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/br-zombies-11-11-12-4/).


Since Zombies aren't the boogeymen they used to be, it seems to me they could be doing really well. No one seems to sideboard Pillar of Flame or Terminus anymore and the B/w version seems to have decent showing, so I decided to give it a try and my playtesting on Cockatrice seems quite promising. Without Pillar of Flame and Terminus the only card that seriously hurts us is Rest in Peace, which is a far better situation then months ago. Other cards are ineffective at best - Azorius Charm is rather terrible against Messanger or Aristocrat, the same goes for Devour Flesh or Ultimate Price. The only true creature threat is Angel of Serenity, though Slaughter Games can usually take care of it (which reminds me to put more into the Sideboard). If Naya Blitz has the nuts, you will probably lose, but that's not much of an argument. With Blood Artists, Vampire Nighthawks, Geralf's Messangers (once they untap - emphasis on ""once"" - they are great blockers) and a plenty of removal make it possible to come back and gain control of the match. The same goes for other, faster decks than this one. 

While most of the deck is rather self-explanatory, here are my thoughts on some of the cards:

- Searing Spear can be used to finish off your opponent while Dreadbore is amazing overall. 

- The mainboarded Pillar of Flame seem to be decent against Naya (killing Champion of the Parish on T1 is really important), Experiment Jund decks with Strangleroot Geist (though I might change them back for the more traditional Brimstone Volley), or Doomed Traveler/Blood Artists in the Aristocrats. At worse, it is a burn spell for two.

- Skirsdag High Priest has great showing in the B/w version and against some decks it provides a continuous supply of huge fliers.

- Bloodthrone Vampire is the B/r version replacement of Cartel Aristocrat in B/w. While it starts off as a 1/1 rather than 2/2 and cannot gain any sort of protection, it is easier on the mana and is also a more relevant tribe, which consequently makes Cavern of Souls more playable. In addition, the vampire's ability seems to me a bit more relevant in lategame even against a stabilized opponent. Just having a Gravecrawler, one more Zombie and BTV on the board presents a considerable threat for your opponent.

- Two mainboarded Vampire Nighthawks and one more in the sideboard, together with the three Gloom Surgeons, should be able to stop the initial onslaught of aggro decks while against control it provides a decent flier with evasion.

So what do Spikes think? Are B/r Zombies viable in the current meta?

I made the switch from paper magic to mtgo for convince reasons and in this switch I came from UWr Flash to Naya Midrange since I thought it had some more favorable match ups. I have been playtesting this deck a lot and I'm really enjoying the deck and all the stuff it can do. The List I have been running is here:

http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/big-naya-02-04-13-1/

The deck is a basic Naya Midrange running just good stuff in it's colors, Restoration Angel and Thragtusk were one of the big reasons I played the deck(if you can't beat them, join them) The ability to drop land and attack with Kessig wolfrun on the table and pass turn to flip a Huntmaster feels great and playing Restoration angel on your opponents turn to blink a thragtusk and flip huntmaster back gaining 7 life that turn is a great play. Boros Reckoner and Loxodon Smiters turn 2 with the Help of Avacyn's Pilgrim helps shut down aggro decks fairly well. But recently I have taken a liking to splashing Black for a few cards such as Olivia Voldaen, and post board Slaughter games and Rakdos's Return. These cards help some of our match ups significantly. So I have gone to making a list for this deck also. Here it is:

http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/dark-naya-07-04-13-2/

But do we need to splash black? Are adding the cards specified above really necessary? We could just play Jund Midrange/Control and already have the favorable match ups. Is jund really better?

**The Cards**

Naya:

* Thragtusk: Gains 5 life and is a big threat and can put the game out of reach for a lot of decks

* Restoration Angel: Has a lot of Synergy with Both Thragtusk and Huntmaster and the ability to flash in is very good.

* Huntmaster of The Fells: Gains 2 life and puts 2 bodies on the table, Just a good card.

* Aurelia, The Warleader: can end games out of nowhere as soon as she drops.

* Thundermaw Hellkite: Good ability when entering the battlefield and can kill planeswalkers as soon as it drops.

* Loxodon Smiter: Stops aggro and can't be countered.

* Boros Reckoner: Can't attack into him.

* Domri Rade: Great Walker and it's pit fight ability with Boros Reckoner is really good.

* Garruk Primal Hunter: Great Planeswalker that puts out 3/3s and draws cards.

* Garruk Relentless: deathtouch wolves and Tutor Ability are good.

* Boros Charm: Saves us from Board wipes as is debated as the best charm.

* Selesnya Charm: Can Exile Angel of Serenity and Obzedat and is Faux counter to Edict spells.

* Kessig Wolfrun: Can take games.

Adding Black:

* Olivia Voldaren: Can end games and is hard to interact with. Really good against naya.

* Slaughter Games: Can name key spells agaisnt ceartin decks that can prevent us from winnining.

* Rakdos's Return: Can empty control players hands after a tapped out Sphinx's.

Round one i had no issues with naya. I get my turn two farseek, and just play my guys. He puts up a good fight, but can not keep up with my removal suite. Game two goes the same, except i ult my garruk. 

Round two was a bit awkward. He had his combo going with misthollw and moorland haunt. To end game one, i abrupt decayed his Dsphere on the end of his turn, which had two thragtusk under it. My turn, i bonfire for three, which got his three misthollow griffins out of the way, and swing for the win. Game two was no differnet, slam guys, bonfire his team. 

Round three was very similar to round 1. Kill his guys, swing with mine. 

Round four was against my roommate. I dont think i deserved the win i got, but i did. He was the first loss of the day. Game one i slam my ground seal on turn two. He just plays through it with thragtusk and resto angel. Game two he mulls to six. I manage to keep him off his mana dorks. Game three, he Mulls to five. He turn ones a mana guy, i kill hit. He misses his second land drop. I get the game shortly after. 

Round Five was a little rough. He gets game one with his removal plus thundermaw. Game two, i resolve a rakdos return, destroying his hand. Game three, he keeps a two land hand. I duress him, taking his rakdos keyrune. He misses the next land drop. I play dudes and when he has to tap out to kill my guys, i nail him with another big rakdos's return.

Round six, only two undefeated so we choose to ID. 

Round seven, i did not need to play. I wanted to get the highest seat so i could always be on the play and there was a small chance i could help the folks i went with sneak into the top 8. We play it out. I get him game one with some tight play. I jam my creatures down and force him to make blocks and cast his resto angel after he blinks a augur. I then nail him wiht a huge rakdos's return. Game two and three are extremely close. He had all the counters and sphinx's revelation when he needed them. The dude never bricked a draw. This puts me on fourth seat in the top 8.

Top 8

First round had me sweating. I knew it is against Naya blitz. He sits down, the judge then tells me,"" Okay, so your oppenent misregistered his deck. You will be going to game two."" I feel a relief come over me. WE play out the game. He starts strong and fast. I stablize at one, then hit my thragtusk. The end of the game he tells me his last three draws are lands. We finish rather early, so i start scouting the other games out. One of my buddies also top eight'd with Naya blitz. I watch his game three. He was playing versus bant auras. He mulled to two cards and proceeds to lose. It was nasty. The head judge comes over to me and says that we can go ahead and play. I thought it was weird that we had to play, due to the seating. We start our games and he walks over me game one and repeats game two. I take my defeat with a smile and head to the front desk. One of the folks i rode with was finishing up some trading at the time, so i go over and watch the other top 8 games. As they finished, the TO tells me that i am actually not out yet. We had a mispair. I am extremely excited at this point. My top four oppenent sits down and we start our match. Our first game was a slug fest with misplays on both parts. I manage to pull out the win with a timed bonfire 'mircle. Game two is not too good for me. I keep a loose hand, two lands and a farseek with two thragtusk, a huntmaster and olivia. He starts with his mulches and grisly salvage and mana dorks. I miss land drop three and then he acidic slimes me, knocking me back another turn. I manage to resolve the olivia, he then slams down his, what he called, super tech Slayer of the wicked. I scoop up my cards shortly after. Game three, he starts with a mulch and hits two unburial rites. He then grisly salvage, hits Angel of Serenity and craterhoof. I am sweating again at this point. I simply play my cards, forcing him to use his unburial rites. He has another in hand. His issue then becomes that he does not ever draw another relavent spell or creature. No souls, no resto angel, no thragtusk. He is at three when he starts to stabilize. I manage to draw my rakdos's return and end the game. I feel like i dodged yet another bullet there. Finals is me versus the UWR i lost to earlier. We play a very tight game one. I ended up getting it with another well timed rakdos's return. Game two, he is on the play. We resolve mullagins. He starts with a sulfur falls, pass turn. I start with an overgrown tomb, duress. He lays out his hand. As i go to start looking at it, he then says, i drew eight cards... At this point, a head judge is called... He is then shortly after is given a game loss. I managed another bullet dodge and i am now the PTQ winner. I feel like I shit more luck than skill that day, but I tried my hardest and i played as tight as i could. So with a little skill and even more luck, you can take down an entire field.

I found I was too slow against Scapeshift and only won if I lucked out and they failed to get the titular card. I also got hosed in one game by Sowing Salt, which only one player boarded against me. To that end I am thinking 1 ghost quarter in the main against both. 

One thing I expected to see which was blissfully absent was Eggs. I'm wondering if I am overprepared for them.

Have to go. If you are interested,  I can recount the matchups from last night. But please let me know how you think I can improve.

Because control decks are so effective at defense they do not need cheap efficient offense as they will can take extremely long amounts of time to win and do not need to worry too much about mana efficiency. Standard control decks will typically have somewhere between 3 and 7 cards whose only purpose is to kill your opponent(nephalia drownyard, kessig wolf run, batterskull, etc) an possibly a few control cards which can deal some damage (snapcaster mages and centaur healers).

In Bant control builds one typically plays thragtusk and a few other big creatures. Therefore it is unnecessary to pack in extra ""win-more"" cards.

Currently, the only definite finisher in Esper control is nephalia drownyard. each deck has its own different variations on the other cards. Ben stark used restoration angel, I've seen some people use Jace, memory adept.

my question is, what are some well placed single card win conditions for control decks ATM? Back in innistrad scars I would run an single Army of the damned and a few planeswalkers. Hwoever, do to the amount of aggro an bonfire in the format I feel like those cards are poorly placed right now.

I originally started with a straight-up mono-black list, but with an influx of enchantment-based lists in my local metagame and the fact this deck is soft to a turn 0 Leyline of Sanctity forced me to clamber for green, if only a minor splash. I'll also be adding more Lilianas and Thoughtseizes if I can obtain some.

Matchup-wise, this deck annihilates most combo lists. Storm is just sad when you take their entire hand apart, and disruption hurts their clock pretty badly. Eggs has to deal with nihil spellbombs and the artifact hate in my list, and there's enough pinpoint removal and disruption to handle a less-than-perfect kiki-twin opening hand.

Aggro is generally a safe matchup, RDW/burn can kill if they get the right hand but disruption puts them into a bad state alongside Phyrexian Crusaders being unkillable. Tokens are a headache though. 

Control's silly enough, but disruption means they're either countering disruption spells or not gaining enough speed.

To get to the point, there are a few absolutely awful matchups that need some help: Jund, Melira pod, and Tron. Jund's mostly bearable until they start cascading into stuff like Tarmogoyf, Liliana, Lingering Souls, etc and it's very hard to actually answer that board state outside of Lashwrithe/Pike-wielding inkmoth nexii or Whispering Specters.

Melira hoses my main wincons, but there might be enough disruption in the list to deal with it. It's still a mostly rough matchup.

Tron's probably the absolute worst though. I have issues actually disrupting tron from getting their Karns, Wurmcoils, or random eldrazi out unless they take 5 turns to get those lands out. More duress maybe or some Surgical Extractions? Maelstrom Pulse even?

I'm entering my first non-FNM tournament at an IQ in a couple days, and want to get my deck finalized for it.

I've been running Bant Control for the majority of RtR standard. I top-4 FNM weekly with it, and feel extremely confident playing it, so this is the deck I'll be taking with me. Decklist can be seen [here](http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/bant-control-18-01-13-4/).

With the recent success of RDW and Bant Auras I'm expecting to see a lot of this Sunday. These are my current ideas to adjust for the metagame.

-1 Think Twice/+ 1 Supreme Verdict: RDW and Bant Auras are both extremely fast. I think it's important to nearly always have a Supreme Verdict in my hand for T3 or T4. Detention Sphere was first choice to cut but after thinking about it I felt its ability to exile enchantments if I don't hit a Verdict put it over the top of an additional card draw early.

-2 Psychic Spiral/ +2 Witchbane Orb: The control mirrors often come down to who can mill the other first. Psychic Spiral was my way to combat this, but is very susceptible to the number of counterspells the control mirror is likely to side in, along with putting myself in an extremely dangerous losing situation in the hopes it resolves. Witchbane Orb gives me the ability to shut their mill strategy down before it ever gets going.

-1 Tamiyo/+1 Ray of Revelation:  Tamiyo is often brought in against midrange decks to shut down whatever threat they slam after a few turns.

So recently, I've decided to pick up Pauper on MTGO. I've settled on UR Post, because it seems to have been doing well in recent daily events, and I've always erred on the side of control or tempo in Standard and Legacy. The only issue is, I have no idea what the ideal list is (since everyone has so many random spicy 1 ofs in their list), no idea what the good or bad matchups are, no idea what my game plan over a long game should be, etc. 

So to anyone who has experience with Pauper or UR Post in particular, what should I know before taking a random net deck? What is the ""core"" of the deck that can't really change, and what changes from person to person more often? What good/bad matchups should I look for?

I recently had a conversation with some fellow magic players and the topic of Slaughter Games came up. I learned that their consensus was that it doesn't do enough to the current game state. I have to ask as well, do you guys find Slaughter Games a card that does well in this meta?

In addition, another question:

When using Slaughter Games, what do you target most of the time. As a Jund Midrange player, this is how I tend to target:

Mirror Matchup: Thragtusk or Thundermaw Hellkite

Reanimator: Angel of Serenity.

Naya Midrange: Thundermaw Hellkite, Thragtusk, and restoration Angel

G/W midrange/aggro: Thragtusk 

Bant enchant: Geist of Saint Traft

It's full of aggressively costed threats (Smiter, Paladin, Call of the Conclave, etc.), but it's fairly hampered by control, and I was wondering whether a human tribal deck would be as effective in the standard meta while being more resilient to Dissipate and Syncopate (see: Cavern).

In my current deck, I usually win with heavy trample (Rancor or Selesnya Charm) damage on big threats (Sublime Archangel, Smiter, etc.). I have some issues with boardwipes, though those are dealt with pretty handily by not overextending, and boarding in Rootborn Defenses (for killing wipes, anyway). It's really the counter magic that's giving it the most trouble. I'm just wondering if trading off my hefty dudes for more lithe and synergistic ones would be be a good tradeoff for the robustness my creatures get to survive the burn like my centaurs and Smiters have.

What sorts of weaknesses do the Human tribal decks have that a non-tribal WG aggro deck wouldn't? I really can't see any, aside from the smaller, more fragile creatures.

I took this to FNM last night, and I was absolutely blown away by how powerful this deck was. I took first place in a field of 45 players, with most people playing other Tier 1 decks. In 5 rounds, I only lost two games.

Round 1: vs. RB Aggro Burn

Admittedly, this was a home-brew and it really didn't stand much of a chance. 

Round 2: vs. GW Aggro

I took one of my losses here because I misread his deck. He didn't draw well in game one, and I only saw a Thragtusk and some Call of the Conclave, so I guessed that this was a slower deck. I didn't put in my Supreme Verdicts, and I paid for that. Game 3 saw my Supreme Verdicts come in (I took Prosak's advice and put an extra one in the side board instead of a third Detention Sphere).

Game 3: vs. Jund Midrange

Fucked this guy up. The answers were always there for me in this game. He scooped out of frustration in Game 2, so he may not be used to playing against such an intense control deck. 

Game 4: vs. UWR Delver

I took this deck down fairly easily. I was able to counter his Geists at every turn, and my piked Restoration Angels were too much for him.

Game 5: Grixis Control

My other loss was here. I hit a clump of land in the first game. The other two games were fairly easy. In the second and third games, he hit Slaughter Games three turns in a row, which I did find suspicious/incredibly lucky, but he chose to remove counterspells and Restoration Angel instead of the Pike.

Overall, this was the easiest night of FNM I've ever had. I'm in love with this deck. We have a ""Top Players"" board where the employees put the Top 4 and their decks. We try and keep the names interesting (our Bant Control player called his deck ""Jace is Handsome""), and the only appropriate name I could think of for this deck was ""The Answer Key."" I had every card I could've needed. The balance between draw power, counters, and other spells is great. 

Anyone else playing this deck? Have you run into any problems? I'm a little bit worried about a match-up against Reanimator, but nothing else is all that intimidating.

In brewing for RTR standard, I want nothing more than to just throw together everyone else's list for BGx Zombies and think I'm the better person.  &lt;/sarcasm&gt;  
  
I want to stay with UW.  Red is my obvious 3rd color, because (as sarcastically stated above) Zombies is gonna be a thing.  Here are my thoughts for each color as it relates to the deck idea:  
  
U: Snapcaster Mage and Cyclonic Rift, along with possibly some charms and counter-magic (Dissipate, Syncopate, Dispel), and the new Day of Judgment effect, plus Jace.  Gives my graveyard some extra value while still providing a means of stabilizing.  I'm not sold on Delver anymore, unless there's a ton of nice Instants and Sorcery spells ready for the not-as-awesome mana cost.  
   
W:  Angels and O-Rings (and supports Geist of Saint Traft, Detention Sphere).  I have 4 Resto Angel and 4 Angel of Serenity coming, and want to use them in some combination.  The classic control color, really, when paired with U.  Also thinking of Fiend Hunter or the various detain targets...maybe even Judge's Familiar.  
  
R:  Mizzium Mortars, Pillar of Flame, Bonfire, Izzet Charm.  I feel these will all be key to beating down the Zombies game, while providing solid card draw and counterspell opportunities.  
  
Give a good mana base (Hallowed and Vents + Sulfur Falls/Glacial Fortress), and I think the pieces are there for a solid UWR deck.

Here are some of the interactions I try to take advantage of:

- Lashwrithe + Mutilate. Nothing wearing the Lashwrithe can die to your own Mutilates, which is a great way to wipe the board and have a solid threat left behind.

- Lashwrithe + Vampire Nighthawk. A flying Wurmcoil by turn 4. It doesn't get much better, right? Vapor Snag aside, it's a pretty resilient combo.

- Vampire Nighthawk + Ring of Kalonia. Alright, so maybe the Ring isn't that good. I've used Revenge of the Hunted, though, and whenever it connects you're in a much better position.

- Lashwrithe + Disciple of Bolas. Gaining life and drawing cards equal to the number of swamps you control plus the creatures base power is a game-ending play. He also has synergy with Revenge of the Hunted.

Batterskull seems worthy of a spot, to be sure.

I've also tried adding Glissa and Ezuri's Brigade, since there are already a good amount of artifacts for metalcraft. Obviously Cavern of Souls on Elf helps, but that's fewer Swamps to draw.

I've tried so many different configurations of this deck, from builds centered around Trading Post, to Birthing Pod,  to Wurmcoil Engine and Grave Titan... I'd like to see if spikes can put their heads together to turn this into something legitimate.

http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/grixis-control-26-04-13-4/

I've built this list after looking at the following lists:

*[Bolas for a Better Tomorrow](http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/bolas-for-a-better-tomorrow/)

*[Joel Larsson's 12th place deck](http://sales.starcitygames.com//deckdatabase/displaydeck.php?DeckID=56985)

*[purpler's Grixis](http://magic.tcgplayer.com/db/article.asp?ID=11233)

**Primer on my list**

Reasons for playing Grixis:
        
I enjoy the win conditions more in Grixis, though I am missing important white cards for control, like Celestial Flare, Sphinx's revelation, Detention Sphere, and Verdict. That being said, I think Grixis has competitive potential, and with proper sideboarding, can be successful in the current meta. I have had success against some American Control builds, because I have fewer creatures so am more capable of handling their threats.

Counterspells:

3 Dissipate, 2 Izzet Charm
Dissipate has built-in graveyard hate and offers certainty unlike Syncopate, and Izzet Charm has versatility, punishing those who tap out. I used to have 3 Syncopate as well, but took them out for the two Opportunity.

Removal/Bounce:

2 Cyclonic Rift - Gets rid of tokens, overload gets rid of planeswalkers, enchantments, hexproof, tokens, and artifacts. Really helps against detention sphere/Oblivion ring/pithing needle, and populate decks.

4 Far//Away - 2-for-1 against tokens, massive tempo swing otherwise. Sometimes a bit awkward when against Thragtusks.

3 Searing Spear - Standard burn, cheap and extend reach. Get sided out for doomblade against non-black decks.

2 Mizzium Mortars - Can kill things like the Loxodon Smiters or Intangible Virtued Centaurs, or overload to destroy a bunch of 3-4 toughness humans. Also gets around Hexproof overloaded.

Card Advantage:

2 Opportunity - Sphinx's for decks without white, instant speed lets Dissipate mana stay up.

4 Think Twice - Normal draw. Considering replacing with Forbidden Alchemy, but is much cheaper on the flashback.

2 Rakdos's Return - Gets rid of a full hand, forces the opponent into topdeck mode and makes racing with Aetherling more favorable.

Planeswalkers:

2 Jace, AoT - +1 relevant against aggro, -2 against control, what's not to love?

1 Ral Zarek - -2 Helps kill things, +1 wins races with drownyard, also leaves aetherling mana up later, -7 got 0 turns once but willing to try again

Creatures:

3 Augur of Bolas - Card advantage and a blocker against most aggro

3 Vampire Nighthawk - Lifegain, stops most 2/x creatures, and can prevent big ones like 5/5 wurm from attacking profitably

2 Aetherling - Win condition.

**Concerns**

I have some general concerns about the deck, in that it doesn't seem particularly strong against anything pre-board(perhaps I tried too much to improve its matchup against everything like Patrick Chapin's article indicated). I know that after sideboard I have a good matchup against most aggro. My heavy removal usually leads to many creatures in the yard with crypt incursion, combined with lifelink from nighthawk so I stabilize well. 

On the other hand, I have had trouble recently against Selesnya aggro-midrange (think Smiters + advents + witchstalkers) and other midrange decks like Junk tokens and Junk reanimator. I think this may be due to how much value creatures like Thragtusk, voice, and sin collector get, regardless of being removed. I don't have much trouble with B/W tokens due to Curse/staticaster/Jace, AoT. 

As for the lists I posted above, I have several questions.

1. Should I go more counter heavy or more removal heavy? The Grixis Draw-Go runs many more counters than I do, as well as a lot more removal, but seems to have done well against various forms of Jund and hexproof. On the other hand, Larsson's list ran only a few counterspells and mostly removal (also a Sire sideboard, which doesn't make too much sense to me).

2. Should I put in the 26th land? If so, what can I take out for it?

3. What creatures should I be running. Nighthawk helps sometimes, but also gets speared many times before he gets value.

4. What are the advantages of a Tapout list compared to the Draw-go style? What about having many 2-of removal rather than a few higher frequency removal?

5. Is Barter in Blood a good inclusion? What about Magmaquake or Mutilate? Rakdos Keyrune?

6. How many planeswalkers? What are the advantages of either getting more, or getting rid of them?

7. Improvements to the sideboard? Suggestions for better removal (victim for example)?

8. Is Desperate Ravings a good card? I don't like the randomness of the discard, but I haven't tested with it.

I'm open to criticism of my list, and suggestions. Though this isn't a ""budget"" list, I probably won't be putting in things like snapcaster or Liliana of the Veil for now.

I play RUG scapeshift with primetime in modern, and lately I've had trouble with particular matchups. I play modern at two different stores and the meta tends to be rather diverse, but at both stores RDW/Burn sees very heavy play and it's a match up I can't seem to consistently win. 

Against burn, I board in spellskite and obstinate baloths for pyroclasm, because pyroclasm can't kill Keldon Marauders and it only trades for goblin guide, I don't think it's worth having. Remand and Izzet Charm are also not super effective at buying me time, either. I don't know what else to have in my board for the match up, though. I have seen people play mana leak in the board for this match up, but I want to know if there are other options.

I have a lot of problems with the sideboard, I just don't know what to remove, or if everything there actually belongs there. Sowing salt is good in the mirror and against Tron. Ancient Grudge is more hate versus affinity and for Restore Balance, which is played in my meta. Nihil Spellbomb is invaluable versus any GY based deck.

The biggest thing is this kills any Melira Pod deck's combo element since Melira Pod is a big part of the meta now and it slows down Kiki-Pod by a fair amount. Also, it shuts down Snapcaster Mage, and reanimator deck, any eggs players that haven't moved on (lol), Lingering Souls and other flashback, opposing Tarmogoyfs, any rogue zombie lists with Gravecrawler. And the Unburial Rites/Gifts Ungiven decks. Also Pyromancer Ascension/Past in Flames. Also destroys the fringe Living End deck going around. Also monoblue tron Mindslaver lock. 

Basically leyline shuts down 2/3 of the field.

Do you guys think it deserves 4 sideboard slots? I think it's the best graveyard hate you can have. I mean it's played in Vintage :P. And you can pitch redundant copies to Liliana of the Veil. 

So what do you all think?

Thanks

EDIT: This is for GP KC, so Scavenging Ooze is not an option. Also, my main concern is Leyline of Sanctity - so that's why I'm hesitant to run things like Tormod's Crypt, Rakdos Charm, and Jund Charm.

SB: 3 Extirpate 

SB: 1 Ghost Quarter 

SB: 2 Maelstrom Pulse 

SB: 2 Spellskite 

SB: 4 Tarmogoyf 

SB: 3 Thoughtseize 

The choices:

Buried ruin: artifact recursion and selection from the graveyard. Better than academy ruins because no blue requirement and to hand means I can dredge without worry. 

Ghost quarter: I put three in the main because it's basically the only way I have to interact with certain decks (tron, scapeshift). There are also lots of targets for it in other decks (gavony, inkmoth, etc) and it is in fact possible to use it as a modern legal wasteland for several matchups. 

Dark confidant:  Bob! Bob is always good. Average damage I'll take from him purely off cmc numbers for the deck is ~1.1.  Card advantage is supremely helpful at finding planeswalkers and seismic while still dredging. 

Deathrite: turn two Lili is good no matter what. Also provides much needed early life gain and helps make the mana ever so slightly easier. 

Haakon: recurrable blocker and hard to remove threat. Can be found and played with dredge. Also, nameless inversion combo is hilarious and incredibly powerful. I have enough discard and filtering that having him stuck in hand is rarely a problem. 

Darkblast: one drop instant speed removal that lets me dredge three. Some of these maybe should be stinkweed imp? 

Nameless inversion:  see Haakon. Almost a recurrable bolt in this deck. 

Faithless looting: the best draw spell a dredge deck could ever ask for. 

Loam:  card advantage, yo! Should be fairly self explanatory. 

Raven's crime: no, you can't have a hand. 

Seismic assault: combine with active loam for board-owning, game winning shenanigans. 

Batterskull: finisher, can be pulled from the graveyard with ruins, helps me stabilize (between Bob and the mana base, I can do a lot of damage to myself), attacks and blocks. Very powerful here. 

Engineered explosives: board wipe of choice. Although it's theoretically possible to set it to five in here, realistically it only goes to three. Still, recurrable board wipe does work. If they're shitting out enough creatures that assault and nameless don't cover it, this does. 

Lili: does work. 

Tibalt: in this deck, he's honestly a fifth and sixth Bob. Gives me much more flexibility on my draws and dredges and occasionally sucks up some damage or burn. All of these are good things. 

Sideboard: 

So most of the sideboard is essentially there to let me turn into a fairly standard kind of jund aggro. Spellskite is just a good card and can be recurred for value. Extra ghost quarter for tron and scapeshift. Extripate for the same plus combo. Maelstrom for tron and anything else too big/annoying to remove with assault/nameless.

I've been playtesting this deck today with my play-group, and it has been doing surprisingly good.

And since the maindeck doesn't pack very much removal made them the perfect blockers. 

Against the midrange matchups varolz really shows his power. Putting a rancor om him is just fun, and the ""free"" regenerate is really really strong. 

Ive only tested the deck against Esper control twice, where I won quite easily both matches.

It has no real weak match ups, yet no really strong match ups either.

The main win con is using Ajani as a lockdown tool once the board is clear, with Celestial Colonnade as our main creature beat source. Elspeth creates blockers and applies quite a bit of pressure. We have burn and life gain with Lightning Helix and Sphinx's Revelation, which also generates good card draw. 

There are little cantrip spells being run, like Shadow of Doubt and Think Twice. 

We have Mana Leak as a way to keep threats off the board, as well as Spell Snare for any pesky two drops coming down, which is quite frequent. 

Snapcaster Mage makes value out of almost the whole deck. He maximizes Path, Mana Leak, Shadow of Doubt, Supreme Verdict, ect.

Jund, at its base, is incredibly powerful, playing Olivia, Huntsmaster, and Thragtusk as the creature base while having blowout cards like Rakdos Return, Bonfire, and the two enemy planswalkers (Liliana of the Veil and Garruk the Primal Hunter).

Currently the modern deck that I play the most is Burn, with the decklist [here](http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/modern-burn-06-03-13-1/). While I do well in local tournaments, the competition isn't as great here and I feel less confident about it in a more competitive environment; due to varieties of decks, and just the general ""all-in"" nature of my deck. For one, against American decks I imagine I just flat out lose with paths, bolts, helixes and snapcasters. It just seems that with the slightest disruption I'm at a disadvantage.

I have the next few days to test and I was wondering what you all might have to say on it. I can get access to nearly any card at the moment so that's no problem. Is there a deck that would be better to take in an unknown field, or should I stick with this? I consider myself an above-average player, not amazing but not bad, and I'd like to do well in this as it's probably the only big modern tournament I will get to play in for a long time.

I've recently been getting into legacy play and I've been playing my mono-black pox resource denial deck([seen here](http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/mono-black-pox-12-02-13-1/)).

A friend of mine is playing Esper Stoneblade, and yikes is that deck a beast. I'll often grab him with a first turn inquisition, or a ritual into a inquisition/hymn, and the nether void has certainly  put a stop on him, but I'm wondering what I can do to deal with decks like Esper Stoneblade. 

I can generally keep the game locked down on resources pretty well, however, once he gets a batterskull in, my choices are limited to say the least. Second game I do my best to force him to discard a stoneforge mystic, then follow up when possible with an extirpate.

What is a good way to deal with batterskull in this mono-black deck? He can return it to his hand at any time, and other than pithing needle on the batterskull, I'm not sure what is best. Another thing that has crossed my mind was splashing green for abrupt decay, pernicious deed and life on the loam. Thanks in advance!
