I ordered an E525 Thinkpad from them that I received on time and seemingly without issue.  The system appeared to work properly and had no issues with the Linux Mint 13 install placed on it for 2 days.  On the third day of use a loud coil squeal/chirp became apparent, becoming louder when it was running on battery power.  Within hours the wireless chipset failed and refused to connect, the display began glitching with horizontal lines appearing through it, and it became unresponsive.  I tested it with a Windows live USB thumb drive, just to ensure there was no problem with the OS before RMAing it. 

The RMA was declined for a ""modified/altered operating system.""  I spoke with a support agent, as well as a manager who couldn't comprehend the difference between an obvious hardware failure that could be found running the BIOS provided diagnostics, and the Linux installation.  

I've used Newegg for years and spent tens of thousands on tech gear with them, so I'm really bummed out by this situation.  I know that they've gone through quite a bit of growth lately and I had hoped that they would retain their world class customer service.  It appears that they haven't.  :(

EDIT 1 - I'll get a copy of the RMA reply I had today, just give me a sec.  The ""manager"" I talked to wouldn't respond to any attempt to explain the situation at all.  She said that the system had been modified and was very forceful in standing by the refusal.  

EDIT 2 - RMA decline response -&gt; http://imgur.com/7bcIJ  
The restore partition was left intact, so I don't know what issue they're having there.

EDIT 3 - Yes, I intentionally left the name on the RMA response.  Hoping perhaps I might get a call from Newegg.

EDIT 4 - I submitted this to Consumerist earlier today and am waiting to hear back from them.

EDIT 5 - I'm going to sleep now and will check this in the morning.  Not sure of whether I will hear back from them on the weekend, but Newegg has been informed of this post by myself and others.

6/9/2012

EDIT 6 - WOW! I just woke up and was not expecting the level of response I've gotten from this post.  Still nothing from Newegg, but I certainly wouldn't expect it at 3:37am PDT.  I'll keep everyone updated on what I hear back.

EDIT 7 - I still haven't heard anything from them at 12:04pm EST, and I'm not sure if I will before Monday.

6/10/2012

EDIT 8 - This edit will remain with a periodically updated time until I hear back from them.  NO RESPONSE AS OF - 11:42PM EST Jun 10

6/11/2012

EDIT 9 - I'm receiving some scripted looking emails from info@newegg.com this afternoon:

""This notification has been sent because we provided you an earlier email in error. You were sent an email indicating that we had posted your item(s) as part of the ""Return."" Unfortunately, this was sent in error; although it is rare, RMA numbers are occasionally posted by mistake.""

Don't know what to make of that considering I was escalated and spoke with a manager who had my account pulled up and the exact response from the tech about the ""modified OS.""

I also got a blank $0.00 order confirmation from them and a UPS 3 Day Select shipping confirmation.  Don't know if that's the old one coming back or if they're sending a new one.    The order number comes up blank if I check the status on Newegg.com.

Stay tuned.

6/12/2012

EDIT 10 (hopefully final) -

 I'm sure many of you saw this story on Consumerist and the front page of Slashdot today.  I spoke with a ""Public Image Professional"" from Newegg who contacted me via email.  She immediately offered to replace the laptop or process a full refund, and I accepted the latter given all the issues I've had with them.  I received an RMA confirmation telling me that it has been approved as a defective product return, and that I will receive a credit in 3-5 business days.

What is this I don't even... *You guys rock!* Thanks to all of you who have stepped up and made your voice heard.

*None of the items below will automatically make you a criminal in all situations*; It will affect individuals differently depending on their circumstances. The bill is also not centered around Linux, but it has a very strong impact on Linux as we know it.

**Yes**, there *are* alternative players for Linux which are properly licensed, but this bill gives copyright holders the ability to define what a 'properly licensed' player is via the terms of their DRM. What happens when they decide that iTunes is the only licensed media player for DVDs and Blu-Ray?

-------------------------------------

This is a kind of crosspost summary of a new copyright amendment bill that was announced yesterday. [Bill C-32](http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?DocId=4580265&amp;Mode=1&amp;Language=F&amp;File=72#16) attempts to 'modernize' copyright law in Canada to bring it up to spec with other developed nations (aka to meet US agenda).

The bill would make it illegal to circumvent or break locks of any kind on digital media, even for personal use. This supersedes all other provisions of the bill, which means you may be a criminal if you

*   Own and play region-locked DVDs from other countries
*   Play regular DVDs on Linux
*   Play Blu-Ray *Discs* on Linux
*   Transfer media to an iPod Touch / iPhone / iPad using Linux
*   Strip DRM from music on Linux in order to listen to it

And anything else that involves restricted content that lacks official Linux support.

Speak up while you can. [Find your MP](http://www2.parl.gc.ca/Parlinfo/Compilations/HouseOfCommons/MemberByPostalCode.aspx?Menu=HOC&amp;Language=E) and write them an email telling them why you are opposed to [C-32](http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?DocId=4580265&amp;Mode=1&amp;Language=F&amp;File=72#16). 

We don't want a US style DMCA, please don't let that happen.

**Edit:** Here is a template based on the email I wrote to *my* MP. Feel free to use it, modify it, or ignore it. :)

**Also:** If you are willing, please take the time to handwrite a letter to your MP instead of sending an email. It's guaranteed to make a much much stronger impact and is a lot harder to ignore. However, don't let this discourage you from sending your email instead. Every voice counts!

-----------------------------------

Dear **&lt;Your MP&gt;**,

I am writing to you again to express a major point of concern I have found with the newly tabled Bill C-32. While this bill appears to make many positive changes, there is one clause which is particularly troubling.


In Article 41 it becomes clear to me that any media with Digital Rights Management (DRM) protection applied supersedes all other changes introduced by the bill. For example, **&lt;Something that affects you personally, such as not being able to legally watch DVDs on Linux&gt;**


This bill does not help the consumer, and it does not help the copyright owner either. If it does not help either of these parties, who is benefiting from it?


Bill C-32 has potential, but it needs work.


Thank you for your time,


-**&lt;Your Name&gt;**

About a month and a half ago I read a reddit post entitled something like ""How to get into linux.""  It was a ""best of"" post that made it to the front page.  I followed the guide, installing virtualbox on my Windows machine to try out linux.  Soon I found myself testing Lubuntu on some of my school's older computers (computers from about 2003, many had 512 mb of ram).  These computers, with Lubuntu installed, now run faster than the new netbooks the school has purchased that are running Windows 7 with 2GB of ram for 500 bucks a piece.  Right now I'm working on a universal Lubuntu image for the school computers, and am playing around with mass imaging using Clonezilla (something the district doesn't even do, their technicians walk around with USB sticks).  I've found that I can get TONS of free computers for my school that are a bit older, but run faster than our newer computers that are running windows, so long as Lubuntu is installed.  So far I am up to 30 free computers in my school.  The kids don't know the difference, and neither do the teachers (many of our teachers are not very tech-savvy).  I just wanted to thank the reddit linux community for introducing me to linux, and sparking my new obsession with learning as much as I can about it to make my school as tech-rich as possible.

TLDR:  Reddit introduced me to linux, now I use it on older computers in my Title 1 school to make free computers useful, kids living in poverty benefit.

UPDATE:  I've gotten MS Word and MS Excel working via PlayOnLinux.  I'm giving DC public schools less and less to complain about should they catch me....

So, you may wonder why I'm wining about all this and posting on r/Linux... well is a little annoying when I found myself in situations like these pictures below:

So, long story short, please if you are considering creating a new project stay away from Google Code, Sourceforge and all those nasty places that say respect freedom but close your software to specific countries just because U.S. Gov think they might be terrorist. Last time I check we Cubans don't like that much exploiting with TNT.

Funny fact if an american gets mad and puts some bombs then gets a cool nickname and several documentaries (unabomber), but if a 3rd world guy lights a candle that is a dangerous terrorist. Don't get played by the media, you're better than that.
 
A geek is a geek in any country, we are Cubans geeks yes, but we don't like dancing, we love star [wars|trek], LOTR books/movies, we LOVE Big Bang Theory, and so on.. geeks will be geeks no matter where they come from, so please.. please, use Github, Bitbucket and any other nice place to share software, we geeks from the ""Axis of Evil"" will thank you. ;)

Savoir-faire Linux has made several requests to the *Régie des rentes du Québec* but the organisation is maintaining its decision to renew their software without launching a call for tenders. *Savoir-faire Linux* is now calling upon the courts to declare that the Régie cannot proceed in this manner and that it must give all suppliers, including free software suppliers, the chance to bid.

The motion has been filed in 2008 at the *Cour Supérieur du Québec* and has started to be heard by the court Monday. I am quite disappointed that this did not receive enough news attention and was hopping that you genious redditors could help me spread the word. I do not work for *Savoir-faire Linux*, neither am I related to them in any ways, but I wanted you to know that someone here tries to defeat Goliath.

Palmer, the founder, originally sought support and input for the product by championing it as the ""Oculus ""Rift"" : An open-source HMD for Kickstarter"".

2. The company started a Kickstarter where they managed to raise $2.5 million in funding for the device but it seems that any discussions pertaining to open source licensing were nowhere to be found. Link: [A blog article discussing this issue](http://robmyers.org/2013/04/26/oculus-rift-free-software/)
3. Palmer posted a response on Reddit where he made it clear that the company now intends to maintain exclusive rights to the software and has no plans to license its SDK under LGPL or any other sort of open source license because of their research and development costs. Link: [Palmer's reply on /r/oculus subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/1dfnhw/id_like_to_hear_palmer_respond_to_this_oculus_not/c9pvvwg), |[screenshot](http://imgur.com/b66DaYq)|

Is he right in saying that it would be impossible to compete if they moved towards more open licensing and that doing so would be unfair because of the R&amp;D that they have devoted to the project? As someone that has been closely been following the Oculus for months I found this quite disappointing since a product this amazing is ripe for innovation and does not deserve to be locked down to anyone who wishes to improve upon it. 

Are there any good examples of hardware/software companies that have been successful even though their products use open licenses?

Edit1: Grammar. 

Edit2: Screenshots.

Edit3:

1. It seems that the issue mostly rests with the disagreements about what constitutes, or defines, open source software and open source licensing. A few concerns have been raised about the current Oculus license as-is but it has been pointed out that Palmer has mentioned that the terms are subject to change and they have yet to settle on a final license and final terms but portions may be released under the Apache license. Currently, the source can be viewed, but there are restrictions on how the SDK may be modified and distributed.

2. The original second bullet also made mention that the Kickstarter was void of any promises of openness and it turns out that this was because the dynamics of the project had shifted heavily once larger key players [think large studios] showed their interest/support. There were concerns about big companies opting away from implementing and supporting the Oculus if it caused them to have to legally release more of their code than they might be comfortable with, based on the terms of some open source licenses. This might have caused trouble for the project because they would have had to deal  with hacking in support for everything individually instead of having native support from game developers into various engines. Much concern lies with how some licenses deal with derivative works.

3. Suggestions have been brought up about just releasing the hardware driver alone with a more relaxed license or even a splitting into multiple versions of the SDK. The issue really boils down into a  double-edged sword in which, on the one hand, a more open license would give more freedom to the community to make more alterations, additions, and innovations to the project, but on the other hand, in doing so it would push away big players that would otherwise embrace the device which would of course could potentially be detrimental to the quick adoption of games into the virtual reality movement. As with most things, it seems that time will tell just how permissive the final version of the Oculus Rift's license will be.

Still running today, still runs all the latest applications, because it doesn't integrate the bloatware with the desktop.  I run Eclipse, Apache, do all kinds of compiling on it, runs great.

Yesterday, I go to re-boot, and it doesn't come up.  Some kind of hardware issue, as I don't even get a BIOS screen.

Being in the middle of a project I don't have time to piece swap to see what the piece is that went bad, power supply, maybe, mother board, maybe, anyway, it would have been a dust bunny swap fest to get the machine up and running again.

I pull the hard drive out of the old machine, plug it into the new machine, with totally new different hardware, and it comes up without a tweak.  Video card is cool (I did go from Nvidia to Nvidia but different models), Audio works, Graphics great, Speed awesome, again, I JUST PLUGGED IT IN AND IT WORKED.

Windows, that was installed dual boot on the same hard drive didn't fare quite as well :p

Anyway, go *nix.  Oh the distro was Ubuntu 12.04 w/ updates, BTW.

Installing Debian, I selected ""LVM - Use entire disk"". But the main drive was a slow and small 5200rpm laptop drive.
Today I inserted my spare 1.5TB drive and booted up. Wanted the system on this bigger faster drive instead.

Old approach: boot on a usb-stick so drives are unmounted, and do ""dd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/sdc"".

LVM approach: add /dev/sdc to the volume group, then run ""pvmove /dev/sda"". This moves all data from sda to other drives (only sdc available). No need to reboot, no need to unmount. While I'm writing this, the data is being moved.

Later, do ""vgreduce megatron /dev/sda"" to remove the slow drive from the volume group and voila. Data moved. (megatron is the name of the volume group and of my computer).

This might be old news to many but I just thought this was really cool :)

I work for a building automation company and our main customers are large Banks. Ironically when I came to work here we had no security other than antivirus software. The boss supported a Wild West approach and it has been a disaster, illegal software, nonstop virus/malware outbreaks. I worked day and night trying to support this mess, including software that I did not even know was installed. 
I tried to get the owner to switch us to an AD environment and ban BYOD.  IT’s budget out of our 7 million a year gross was and still near $0, and everyone wanted something for nothing. The owner is all about surfing porn from his office and he doesn't deny it. No matter what I did I was not able to keep up on the number of infections on just his computer.
One week he went on vacation so I installed Linux Mint on a spare computer I built out of recycled junk from around the office. To my amazement he loved it. Everything in the office is now opensource. The firewalls at both of our CoLo’s and at our office are pFsense, our web servers are Ubuntu and our SAS software is all built on apache, postgres, java, etc. Our office runs OpenERP, Samba, LDAP, Zimbra, MediaWiKi, RT, Asterisk, and Mercurial. The workstations are now Linux Mint, I removed Thunderbird because I want employees to use our emails web client. I removed transmission because we have no need for bit torrent in the office. I updated all the workstations to LibreOffice 4.x, Chrome, PDFsam, Microsoft Fonts, Skype, Kaza, and OpenVPN, GatherPlace on all the laptops, freeCAD for the engineers workstations, InkScape, Scribus, Audacity and Blender for Marketing. I started weekly training classes to help with the new software.  I manage support using x11VNC via ssh and Bash scripts.  Security has never been better, there are no outbreaks, no rouge emails to customers from hijacked Outlook programs, office traffic is lowest it have ever been. pFsense has been great also, I broke the office in VLANs, I broke VPNs into groups and change key every year or every time we lose an employ, I employed VPN between the office and CoLo’s in addition to the road warrior setup. 

Updates: 
I installed Jitsi and really like it, I could use it to replace skype, pidgin, and would give a sip phone client to boot for anyone away form their desk. I did not test any calls so don't know how well it would work over a random VPN. The only problem I see is their is no PPA unless you use the unstable version, maybe I missed something so I would have to do manual updates which I don't have time for. 

Using NX instead of freecad to design 2 housing a year is unrealistic at $15,000 down and $3500 support, Solid Works is not much better. We are a building automation company, not a mechanical engineering shop. 

I guess I did not list all the software I use which lead to a lot of questions. I run VMware with vCenter, and use the web based vSphere to manage my two CoLo's and in my office server cluster. I said $0 for a budget but the boss does help a little. We run SuperMicro servers and have 38 virtual servers currently running. They are the best bang for the buck, but far from great. They work is best I can say. We spent $150,000 upgrading our hardware in our two CoLo's. I re-appropriated the 3 year+ old hardware to our office where I host all the systems I discuss. I coveted some of the servers to SAN/NAS using FreeNAS it works well for that. 

I will have been with the company 2 years in July. When I came the prior IT Director hacked some systems together, did no backups and you had to reboot the Zarafa email server and the SNAP server weekly. He was smart and qualified but no follow through. He would install a system to ""check it out"" hack it together to see if it would run and if it did he left it. He never debugged any non-major flaw. So to say it simple every thing ran like crap and in content state of repair and everyone new it. When he was fired for causing a 72 outage of our main SAS product and loosing 4 weeks of customer data, he made many threats toward the company. I worked 80hr weeks to replace every system we had. He had XEN, KVM, VirtualBox, and Qemu all hosting office services. There were countless services running on each server in a live environment. I had no password or even a list of what was out there. I pushed the owner to buy more hardware for our SAS cluster and move the old equipment to the office where I began rebuilding. The office and CoLo's were using some 5+ year old Juniper SSG's, I replaced them with pFsense and locked down all ports but email. Everyone was pissed, but I had to lock out the old IT admin ASAP.  They were running OpenVPN on a server sharing dozens of other services, I moved this to pFsense which had a new IP and ports, I used dual auth (LDAP and Key). I had put together a Samba and LDAP server, so I could control password via LDAP. VPN was down for 3 weeks, again everyone hated me. Every reboot of the NAS took house to rebuild, I worked as hard as I could to move everyone to Samba. Remember we are a windows shop at this time. We only had one windows server licence (2000) and it was a Dell OEM. Once my Samba was completed I replace email with Zimbra. I hosted it out at our cluster instead of at the office for better reliability.

I see a lot of posts ageist ""Mercurial"", everyone is pushing SVN or GIT. I chose Mercurial because SVN don't let you branch and GIT is all command line. Mercurial has a nice web interface. It works well, out of all the things I posted I don't really understand all the love-loss?

Why I choose the things I did. You have to understand that I'm giving support to the general populous of my company, so when I make choices to remove Thunderbird, I'm not saying it is a bad program. What I'm saying is it is more work to support, and I already have a web interface that does most of what Thunderbird does. I chose a 32bit disto because I have old equipment and did not want to have to track bugs in more than one system. 

Why I choose Mint 13 and then bastardized it? It all started with the Intel DN2800MT. We build a gateway device and we are currently using the Intel DN2800MT with mSATA at the heart of it. The board is rock solid, but the video drivers are a nightmare. We run a headless version on Debian Squeeze so we don't care. Here comes the caveat, we get these units in from the field for warranty replacement and we 20% of the time there is nothing wrong with them. So we use them for internal office projects and if we have extra the IT/Engineering staff take them home for personal projects. I've been a fan of Mint for a while, only because of styling. Our lead electrical engineer love openSUSE. The real question is do you like Yum. Yast, or Aptitude. I've use them all and they all have their advantages. When Mint won the battle was because Mint 13 32bit Mate was the only distro that worked with graphics on this board at install. Hence Mint became the choice when there was to be any misc projects at the office. Could we of probably of made other distro's work, well with enough time and money you can do anything. Two things we have little of by the way. I took the easy way out, our Lead Engineer tried to get openSUSE to work with out luck, and our lead programmer tried Debian, failing also. I was the first with a HTPC, based on Mint and equipment out of the junk heap! I don't know how much time they spent, but they are both smart guys who know Linux well. I swapped the owner over to Mint, because that is what I had on my thumb drive at the time, I choose Mint 13 64bit Cinnamon. He liked it so much he asked that I add it to his netbook. Cinnamon was causing driver issues, so my fall back?  Mint 13 32bit Mate and it worked from install. Hate on me if you will but I just need this stuff to work. At the time we decide to use Linux as the defacto OS for the office there were already a half dozen boxes around using Mint 13 Mate to do things. I locked these boxes out of open internet so they were well neutered. Mostly the severed as printing stations, time clocks, etc running only a web interface to openERP.
I also run Fully Automated Nagous, it works well, one response was using zabbix, I did not really care for it, but use what you like.

Security; 
I used pFsense to block most traffic, offshore to interoffice networks. Each department has its own networked VLAN. I froze ARP and locked down everything. Everyone hated me. When I used Squid to block facebook, youtube, and anything sports related there was almost a mutiny. Ironically sales were up 12%! Managers were at each others throats, sales fighting the hardest, saying they needed a ""Staycation"" at there desks between calls. Another irony was daily sales calls were up much more that 20%. I guess when your board at work you call people, even clients? We backed off eventually and sales decreased..... 
At the workstations; I do not allow users access to root, I locked down iptables, added fail2ban, installed AdBlock Plus. I  enabled IDS in pFsense. I purchased TrenMicro security for endpoints which monitors my Vmware and Linux servers, I also run scripted scans from my Linux workstation of bitdefender, and avast, just to feel worm and fuzzy. 

Training;
I do weekly training for anyone in the company who wants to attend every 3:30 to 5:00 pm on Mondays. I used Kazam to capture the screen as video and edited it via Blender. I have videos geared directly to our office setup! The videos are available linked via the wiki to our samba share. Blender was the most popular with around 15 people attending. 


How long did it take?
Three weeks to convert the office to Linux Mint 13, but the real answer is about two years working a lot of nights and weekends. Wiki alone has 1,612 pages (Filled out by everyone).

Hello, I'm a GNU/Linux user, you're a GNU/Linux user and we need to talk.

You want information on the lastest Distros, you want to read reviews of Distros, you want to see what are the most used Distros at the moment... where do you go ? Probably DistroWatch.

But wait, and think for a moment... why do we still use a Website that looks like a 90s one ? Well... it's usable: that's what you think.

First: The ranking, is it accurate ? Nope, it's based in Clicks Per Minute... seriously ?

Also, if you want to submit your Distro to DistroWatch, you need to pay 200$ first... I mean... Are you kidding me ?
And not to mention, you can't edit anything: if you do a review of Ubuntu 12.04, you can't just edit the Ubuntu page and add a link to it.

So, what do I suggest ?

* Create a new website, that looks more modern, with videos, slides and so, but keeping usability.
* The website will be ""Wiki-Like"" meaning you can edit Distro's pages, or even submit your own.
* An accurate Ranking, we can create an algorithm that actually works.
* And of course, completly free. 

What do you think ? We need opinions, suggerences, we need people, servers... just an idea for now, but we can make this happen.

**EDIT: Thanks for the 200+ responses, that is what I love about Linux; the users are helpful!** 

**It seems that half of the problem is with me not knowing the difference between UEFI and BIOS and trying to boot into a non-UEFI distro. The other half is with the company not mentioning anything about UEFI or Windows 8!**

**I'm going to attempt to make a UEFI USB stick with Arch on before attempting to return it.**

**tl;dr** Spent ages looking forward to laptop; Windows 8 is the only option.

Sorry for the wall of text.

When my old laptop died my time educating myself about Linux, networking and programming came to and end. I started saving up for a new one and found a great company pcspecialist.co.uk that sold Clevo laptops without operating systems. This meant I could save £100 on Windows and get some really nice hardware. 

Quad core i7, 8GB's of 1600Mhz RAM and 120GB SSD all for £600 in a nice aluminum finished case! By Xmas time I had enough to buy it so I ordered it in the hopes it would arrive before Xmas day. Unfortunately it did not and it has only just arrived. 

Oh well it is really good looking, with a nice keyboard and touch pad; it was worth the wait! Now to power it on to check the BIOS to see if I got all the right hardware I had ordered.... huh Windows 8 ""Enter Product key""... Okay well I guess they just do that as default. No way to shut it down, lets just install it so I can turn it off and get to BIOS.

Hmm... No BIOS access even once I had googled the manual, there wasn't one with it, and found the right key to be pressing. Odd. Rang up the company and inquired, apparently you need to hold Shift when you shut down Windows 8 to get it to actually shut down. Da fuq.

Anyways boots up and into BIOS wooo! okay lets put my CrunchBang CD in and set the boot order. Hm. No option to boot from CD/DVD. That is rather odd. No matter I have it on my USB stick!

This time I get an option to boot from the stick! Okay lets select that.... Reboots into Windows 8! Now this is starting to get on my nerves. Back into BIOS, disable booting from the SSD, so this time it can only boot from the USB stick. 

Boots into Windows 8. Fuck a duck this is worst than a rootkit. Okay extreme measures now; lets take out the SSD so it CAN'T boot from Windows 8. Power it on goes straight to BIOS. Well you can select boot override to boot straight into the USB stick from BIOS, that should work. Enter. Enter. Enter. Enter! Enter!!!

Did nothing. I then tried Ubuntu 12.xx, same again. Then tried a Windows 7 DVD, that wasn't detected. So unless I had a 8GB USB stick with Windows 7 (Which I didn't) I don't think I could have used anything except Windows 8.

Now it is going to cost me £36 to get my money back and I am still without a laptop to continue my computing enlightenment.

:(

EDIT: Thanks for all the support guys! The few things that have een suggested are:

* Disable secure boot
&gt;I had already found this in the BIOS and disabled it so that didn't help

* Make sure your bootable media is UEFI compatible. 
&gt;I'm not entirely sure if what I have been using is/ I've been making Live USB sticks with this softare: http://www.linuxliveusb.com should that work?

* Put another HDD in
&gt;A friend suggested that I put the HDD from my old laptop in, I may try this as a last resort

* Take the SSD out and format/install linux on it from another machine
&gt;Again, could do this but even more effort and perhaps void warranty?

* Don't pay the £36 you shouldn't have to
&gt;I'll have to look up on this it does seem a bit dodgy

* Send it back to give them a message that locked bootloaders are bad.     ....mkay
&gt;This is the main reason for sending it back I think!

* Perhaps try this http://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/20303.html
&gt;It may work but looks like a lot of effort that I shouldn't have to go to 

* What model is the laptop?

It is what it is.  So my laptop dual boots.  A few days ago, my laptop's windows partition wouldn't boot.   I went back into ubuntu, which immediately launched a utility to tell me I had SMART disk errors, and that my hard drive was going to die soon.  No surprise, it has survived ~6 years of being toted everywhere, gone through several batteries and several wall chargers - serious abuse.  So I backed up everything that was recent and ordered a new disk, because I love my thinkpad.  

This morning, Ubuntu told me my disk had major problems and it was ""operating outside parameters.""  So I tried to run the SMART utility, and my taskbar is gone.  No problem, I'll launch it from the shell.  Bus error.  The hard drive is dead.  I can't access it in any way, I can't launch anything. No surprise, it was on its way out.  

What was surprising to me is that, as of tonight, Ubuntu is still running from memory.  Not just a shell, but a full on OS.  Yeah I lost metacity, and can't launch new programs, but I'm typing this in Firefox on the failed system, which is still connected wirelessly to my network.  

I'm going to shut it down for good in a minute, at least until the new drive gets here, but running ~11 hours without a hard drive is pretty impressive stuff.  Just thought I'd share.

1362249436.0,582,self.linux,19j779,[Correction] Watching DVDs on Linux is NOT illegal in the USA,776,194,82,http://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/19j779/correction_watching_dvds_on_linux_is_not_illegal/,"This is in response to the [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/19iq93/why_watching_dvds_on_linux_is_illegal_in_the_usa/) saying it was illegal to watch DVDs in the USA. I thought I would clarify legal DVD use with free software in the United States.

Section [1201](http://static.chillingeffects.org/1201.shtml) of the DMCA specifically outlaws the *distribution* of circumvention tools.

&gt; No person shall manufacture, import, offer to the public, provide, or otherwise traffic in any technology, product, service, device, component, or part thereof, that is primarily designed or produced for the purpose of circumventing a technological measure that effectively controls access to a work protected under this title 

-DMCA 1201(a)(2)

It does *not* outlaw the *use* of those tools. Fair use of circumvention tools is legal according to the DMCA

&gt; Nothing in this section shall affect rights, remedies, limitations, or defenses to copyright infringement, including fair use, under this title

-DMCA 1201(c)(1)

So, is it legal for Ubuntu to distribute [libdvdcss2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libdvdcss) in the US? No. Is it legal to watch DVDs on Ubuntu using libdvdcss2 in the US? Yes. No one inside the US can distribute that program to you, however, so you have to find it outside of the US. This is why the [medibuntu](http://medibuntu.org/) repositories are hosted in a country that still allows circumvention program distrobution.

The [RealNetworks v. DVD-CCA](http://www.eff.org/cases/universal-city-studios-v-realnetworks) decision referenced in the previous post actually said this specifically:

&gt; while it may well be fair use for an individual consumer to store a backup copy of a personally owned DVD on that individual's computer, a federal law has nonetheless made it illegal to manufacture or traffic in a device or tool that permits a consumer to make such copies.

Short introduction: this is because of the [patent](http://www.google.com/patents?id=Om0LAAAAEBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22Method+for+rendering+shadows+using+a+shadow+volume+and+a+stencil+buffer%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=bB3DTtaIOqbw0gGKpIXrDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA) held by Creative for the so-called [Carmack's Reverse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_volume). So, he's supposedly rewriting it, even though he could leave that as the exercise to the community.

I grew up on games fueled by his engines and this is a way of showing the man my never ending love.

Just a quick edit to show how [trivial](http://twitter.com/#!/ID_AA_Carmack/status/137189212519792640) the patent in question really is:

To install, extract the folder and run the install.sh script with root in a terminal (it'll ask you a few questions). GRUB is weird about widescreen, so choose the resolution that matches your highest supported GRUB resolution. This can be bound with installing the hwinfo package and running

    hwinfo --framebuffer

with root, or with

    vbeinfo 

at grub's command line

Their output may be different though.

Theme is released under CC-SA, fonts are Apache, and installation scripts are GPL.


**In some occurences (as in testing on really old PCs) GRUB has locked up when a theme is applied, so use at your own risk (there's ways to restore GRUB if that happens)**

You can find my other work [here.](http://gnome-look.org/usermanager/search.php?username=LegendaryBibo&amp;action=contents) I have more themes here.

If you want to disable it, open up /etc/default/grub in a text editor with root then find the line with GRUB_THEME  and comment it out by putting a '#' at the beginning of the line or by erasing it. Then save it and open up a terminal. First thing you want to do is locate your grub.cfg file with

    locate grub.cfg

So its location should be in /grub, /boot/grub, or /boot/grub2.

Now, run this command to update grub

    grub2-mkconfig -o /grub/grub.cfg
   
or

    grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg

or

    grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg

with root depending on grub.cfg's location.

**If you're on Ubuntu you can just run this**

    sudo update-grub

**to do the same thing**

I know that one of the big reasons that Linux is thought to be secure is because everyone can see the source code.  That's great, and I'm sure it would make it more difficult to sneak something malicious into the code, but wouldn't that still be possible?

I'm not what I'd consider an expert, but I am a programmer and I know how complicated code can get.  Is it crazy to think that some really smart government programmers could write a really smart piece of code that was disguised as something else?  The Linux software stack is so large, it seems like there would be a lot of places to hide something, possibly inside something as fundamental as the kernel or a commonly used compiler or a master key to a widely used encryption algorithm.

Again, I'm not an expert (and maybe a little paranoid), so I'm asking, how do we know that our Linux systems are any less likely to have government backdoors than proprietary operating systems?

Go figure. After years of being his personal on-call tech for any Windows issue he had, I finally decided to try something. He had just picked up some virus or another, and I was getting sick of fixing his computer.

I burned a copy of Ubuntu to a disc and went over to his house. I explained to him that I was going to reformat it and put a new OS on his system. He didn't really follow what I meant, until I loaded the live demo of it to show him what it would look like. 

Immediately I was met with lots of objections. Of course. I spent a couple hours getting it set up - I moved all the files he wanted to keep to a new partition, yada yada yada, and then formatted windows off of the system and plopped on Ubuntu.

I sat with him for a bit and showed him how to access everything, how it works. One of the first comments he made was about how intuitive it was. 

This was 5 years ago. 

I never received another call for help. He never ran in to problems he couldn't figure out how to fix himself, after that. I did go over regularly at first to see how he was acclaimating to the change. He loved it.

So about a month ago I built him a new PC. His computer was already archaic when I put Ubuntu on it. I'm pretty sure he got it in 97 or 98. He was finally calling about issues with his PC again and I figured it was on its last legs. It could barely handle anything running on the system. It was in a sad way. So I ordered parts and threw a new one together for him. Oh, look, it came with a free OEM copy of Windows 7. 

As I'm pulling parts out of the box, he spots the disc. He doesn't say anything, but I notice him turn pale, and he starts pacing around nervously as I begin piecing it together. Once it's successfully POSTed I reach into my toolkit and grab the copy of Ubuntu I had brought to install, and put the Windows disc away, and immediately he says ""oh thank you so much."" I look up and say, ""for?"" He says ""I was afraid you were going to put Windows on the new computer."" I laughed. ""Nope, you like Ubuntu right?""

Everyone says Linux is too technical for a non-tech to grasp or use. While this is only one sample, I think this shows that that isn't the case. If my dad can learn Linux, I think anyone can grasp it.

My wife and kids also use Linux, I have gotten my dad to switch, my in-laws, and several others. I never had any major problems, most things work on install, some alsamixer setting might need to be set, or proprietary wifi drivers, but overall everything just worked. I've worked on some friends' and families' computers but mostly hardware issues, or software conflicts.

I started working at a small computer repair shop a month ago. I now realize that Linux has spoiled me. Software conflicts, viruses (yesterday, one had 566), toolbars, software that takes too much system resources, and Windows being clunky itself. We also buy and sell used computers. Typically if a computer still has a Windows key sticker on it we will load whatever version of Windows the code is for, but the ones that don't have the sticker, or it's unreadable we use them for parts. The boss said that the next one that we get that doesn't have a sticker I can put Linux on it (we have enough parts computers). I told him that if I do that, he will probably never see them again until there was a piece of hardware that went bad and that might actually be bad for business. He agreed but he was willing to do one as a trial, we have a *lot* of parts computers. 

Anyway, I have remembered why people get frustrated with Windows and why I switched to Linux.

The resizing is bad and the developers should feel bad, right? But at some point enough was enough and I decided to take a closer look. okular uses the Splash backend of poppler (it's actually the default backend) for rendering PDFs.

Splash does some naive resizing using a Bresenham algorithm (sic!) so I found this [3 year old issue](https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=22138) on the poppler tracker and proposed that it should be replaced with Lanczos for upscaling. The response in the vein of ""patches welcome"" was not unexpected. I started looking at Lanczos implementations and realized I can't do any better than using an existing library. I picked ImageMagick.

After carefully integrating it in the 2 build systems supported by poppler as an optional dependency (defaulting to ""auto"") I went on to implement bitmap conversion from Splash to ImageMagick and back, resize the bitmaps with the default filters (which are great) and added a special case for soft masked images that are not supposed to use pixels inside the masked region which is somehow unavailable at the moment of the resize. You get the point. It was complicated but totally worth it when the results are [like this](http://i.imgur.com/JAOcR.png) (pdf examples taken from the poppler issue, the formula is soft-masked).

Hurray! Finally up to par with Adobe Reader when it comes to images? Not so fast. The main developer doesn't like adding a new dependency besides fontconfig, freetype, zlib, glib, cairo, gobject-introspection, curl, jpeg, openjpeg, lcms, libpng, qt-core, qt-gui and tiff. Another developer had ""*some bad experiences*"" with ImageMagick ""*a couple of years ago (nothing to do with raster image operations)*"" but he'd be OK with the patch as long as ImageMagick is disabled by default...",,False,,t5_2qh1a,False,,,True,t3_yr180,http://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/yr180/thats_why_we_cant_have_nice_pdfs/,

1297354597.0,427,self.linux,fitm2,HELP! HP isn't honoring my netbook warranty because I'm running linux!,736,309,534,http://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/fitm2/help_hp_isnt_honoring_my_netbook_warranty_because/,"I guess I'm hoping that someone here might have some connection at HP, or know how to contact a higher tier tech support, or something.

Basically I have a brand new netbook I got for Christmas. First thing I wiped the drive and installed Fedora on it. Yesterday, the battery went kapoot. It's completely dead... won't charge at all. The BIOS is giving me error code 601, which I looked up and says the battery needs to be replaced. You would think that's enough for the warranty to get it replaced, right? Nope.

I've been on the phone with tech support now for over an hour. The guy there has no clue what to do, he's having me run all kinds of pointless tests that don't have anything to do with the battery. Then after speaking to his supervisor, they can't send me a new battery unless I put Windows 7 Starter back on the netbook, then run their special little HP battery status test.

I've given them the BIOS error code (I don't even think the guy knows what the BIOS is honestly), and I told them the output of the acpi command, which is ""charging at zero rate - will never fully charge"". But they're going by the book, and without the HP battery status application they won't send me a new battery.

Right now the only option they're giving me is to PAY to order the Windows 7 Starter media from them to restore my netbook to factory condition, to run their utility, to get my damn battery replaced.

This is absolutely f'ing ridiculous. I'm steaming pissed right now... and I'm still on the phone holding to speak to the supervisor.

Can anyone offer any assistance? A phone number for higher level support? Or someone at HP who works in tech support that actually has a brain and doesn't work in India?

I know /r/linux may not be the best subreddit for this, but oh well... I need people with linux knowledge to understand my headache! :)

**EDIT:** Quote from the supervisor:

Him: You have voided your software warranty and need to reinstall Windows 7 to get it back

Me: Ok, well the issue I'm having is HARDWARE, not SOFTWARE

Him: I understand, but in order to get the warranty ID #, you need to use Windows 7

Me: Well I can't do that, and I haven't voided my hardware warranty, which is what the battery is covered under.

Him: Well I am the supervisor here and I know the warranty better than you do.

**EDIT2:** I've now been on the phone for 2 hours and 20 minutes... I finally spoke to some case manager, and she gave in and is overnighting me a new battery. But if the ""problem persists, I will need to reinstall Windows 7"". I can guarantee this is the last time I will ever buy an HP product.

**EDIT3:** I got the battery this morning. Guess they shipped it overnight air. Netbook is working just fine now. :) I did notice that the 'acpi' command in Fedora doesn't work right with the battery though. It still says the same thing, that the battery is charging at a rate of zero, and will never fully charge. However it IS charging, unlike the other battery. I guess that has something to do with the acpi in Fedora not being fully compatible with the netbook's hardware, who knows. I might throw another distro on it just for kicks and see what it says.",,False,,t5_2qh1a,True,,,True,t3_fitm2,http://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/fitm2/help_hp_isnt_honoring_my_netbook_warranty_because/,

Compare systemd, SELinux, and (in future) Wayland to Upstart, AppArmor, and Mir. Do these combinations look anything alike? We are seeing a splintering of the traditional Linux ecosystem into two distinct Fedora and Ubuntu ecosystems.

Both distributions are trying to create a core OS stack that can be used to create compatible distributions. ""Why have different init systems or display servers, etc., when we can all agree on and then build off of a common base?"", they seem to be saying.

So far the Fedora camp has support from more distributions (excluding any downstream distros). Arch, Mageia, and openSUSE are ~~two~~ three big names among them. Ubuntu's stack is not getting wider community support. Debian, Gentoo, and Slack, each with a different goal altogether, don't seem to be following either at the moment.

We are witnessing history as it unfolds. Good or bad, we will have to, as users and participants, pick a side soon enough. Instead of Linux we will see Linux-Fedora-Camp and Linux-Ubuntu-Camp, in addition to Linux-xyz-Camps. Many upstream userland projects, such as GUI toolkits and desktop environments, will also favor one side more than the other.

I believe that as things stand right now, people who are sysadmins and desktop users will gravitate toward the Linux-Fedora-Camp and people who are mobile users and gamers(1), with some desktop thrown in, will gravitate toward Linux-Ubuntu-Camp. Those of us who fall into both categories, because we are sysadmins *and* mobile users, will participate in Linux-Fedora-Camp as enthusiastic contributors (including hearty flamewars) and will just use Linux-Ubuntu-Camp products with minimal or no participation.

I'm not saying the split is good or bad for not only the ecosystem but for users as well. Only time will make that decision. I'm just trying to create awareness about what I see of how things are as they stand now and the effect they have on our future.

I found this a striking coincidence: something as arbitrary as the one CRC32 collision in 100,000 words packaged with the OS is a word that is *also* the collective name of the foundational command line utilities that make up said OS?  Depending on who you ask, part of the very name of the OS?  So I wrote a quick Perl script to investigate for myself:

    cat /usr/share/dict/words | perl -e 'use String::CRC32;
    my %crcs; while(&lt;&gt;) { chomp($_); $crc = crc32($_);

Out of the box, it starts crashing when browsing the web, browsing the file system, and frequently locking up right after logging in.

I reformatted, re-installed ubuntu, and swapped the memory cards in and out to figure out that the motherboard was the issue. I discussed this with their support and they let me return it after some more conversations.

At this point, it took 2 weeks for me to receive the laptop, 2 weeks to diagnose and get the shipping labels, another 1 week for the laptop to ship/return, 2 to get fixed, and 1 to ship back. All in all, that's 2 months.

I then received the laptop without the power adapter; they claimed it wasn't received and wanted me to buy another one... for $70. I managed to get them to send me another for free when I threatened to return the whole machine. So add another week for the adapter to ship.

Sadly, when I finally got the adapter and booted up... it froze. They replaced the memory cards and the harddrive, which weren't the problem, and the exact same problems occurred immediately.

So the company's philosophy on a lemon is to do the laziest 'fix' possible, and then not to check if it actually worked.

At this point, I decided to return the entire system, and they obliged me. When they received it, they decided to take off another $125 for scratches, of course... and there's no way it got scratched on my end, considering it was never used for more than a few hours and sat in a laptop case the rest of the time.

Just something to think about.

I will probably be posting for him from time to time due to his eyes not being able to tolerate the backlight of the monitor. He is down to about 20 minutes a day here because the backlight makes him terribly sick.

As many of you know, Ken's cancer has just recently begun to spread to his right lymph node but his Oncologist has assured us that this is 80 percent curative if he gets the needed surgery in time. Unfortunately, his 1100 dollar a month SSI disability disqualifies him for Medicaid and the local county low-income insurance he was receiving. This leaves us with about 2 weeks to either raise enough money for at least the OR for the surgery (we are hopeful of finding a surgeon to do the work pro bono) or raise enough money for the entire procedure. We've spent hours upon hours researching and contacting the links some of you have provided but they are so limited in scope that 90 percent o
f them are not helpful at all.

We are looking at two weeks, maybe three before the cancer spreads past the point of surgery being an option. After that, we've been told just to make him as comfortable as possible until he passes. I'm not ready to accept that.

I know it's a lot of money but recently a bus monitor was donated over a half million dollars in donations for being harassed by a bus full of children. We only need to raise a fraction of that. I think if the Linux community pulls together, we can make this happen. I have heard about a site called Reddit that might be able to help but I have no idea how to access it or post to it. Does anyone have a Reddit account that could pass this news along?

Thomas A. Knight has put up a page that tells Ken's story and he's volunteered to host the fund raising page for this effort. Please help us by a small donation and spreading the word. Ken's done magnificent work for the past 7 years in getting Linux computers into the hands of poor children. I'm just hoping that the community at large sees enough value in Ken to help him beat this monster. Because, as it looks now, you are about the only hope he has.

See Thomas' page here. If the page times out, just hit F5 and it will connect, just be patient and from the bottom of my heart, thank you.

* you have a dumb router that doesn't play well with torrents
* you are being monitored (work, library wifi)
* you want to stream regionalised content from another country

Seting up a VPN is never trivial though. Here's a quick and dirty replacement, if you have ssh access to another box, using SOCKS 5:

ssh -D 7654 user@333.333.333.333

where 333.333.333.333 is the remote address, and 7654 is any local port on your PC.
You setup Firefox or your torrent client (qBittorrent plays well with SOCKS5) to use socks 5 server 127.0.0.1 (or localhost) port 7654. And voilà. 

* all your traffic is encrypted
* you can't be monitored by your access point
* your router doesn't get confused by the connection attempts from torrent peers
* you get to watch comedycentral shows during your trip to North Korea
* and your ISP can't pin your dirty torrenting to your home (they'll pin it on your remote box, though, so...)

edit: You usually get much higher DL/UL speeds, I'm not entirely sure why.

I am fairly new here and decided to post my first link. Since reddit likes original content, I thought it's a good idea to present a project that I founded myself with a friend and has gained some momentum and also inspired others to join.

As the name suggests, it's all about MiniDiscs and bringing support for them to Linux (and virtually every other platform). While MiniDiscs don't play an important role in the audio world anymore, I still liked a format enough to try to get it work with free software.

For those who don't know: There are MiniDisc devices which use a proprietary USB protocol (NetMD) or on-disk format (Hi-MD) to transfer and store audio data. Naturally, these devices were only officially supported on Windows (and partially on MacOS). However, after many hours of reverse engineering, we finally managed to get the MiniDisc hardware to work on Linux.

We support reading and writing to NetMD devices, reading from Hi-MD and (experimental) writing to Hi-MD. We have worked together with the guys from VideoLAN and ffmpeg to get their software support the audio formats of the MiniDisc (ATRAC-SP, ATRAC3 and soon ATRAC3+). With some more work on the code, we will soon be able to fully support all MiniDisc devices with our software making the use of the proprietary software from MiniDisc vendors unnecessary.

We're constantly looking for new contributors and users :).

I hadn't really thought about this in some time so it took me a few seconds to come up with a reply. For me it's about having the freedom to do whatever I want with the system. Linux provides me with a full feeling of ownership which I have never had with either Mac or Windows. 

On top of that there's the 'feel good' factor that I am using something that is free and open. 

I was just curious about other non-developer types out there. Why do you use Linux and to what extent (i.e., only occasionally, main OS)?

I just completed LFS 7.1 and a pretty decent amount of stuff from BLFS, and I'm beyond stoked to be making this post from my new build. [Here's](http://i.imgur.com/QjHz8.jpg) a screenshot of my desktop. It's not perfect, and it's nowhere near complete, but it's up and running and stable, and I think that's close enough to say that the project was a success. I've been playing around with GNU/Linux for about 5 years, and in general I still consider myself a bit of a noob when it comes to many things, but I learned a lot from this process, and I thought I'd share a few of them with r/linux .

I have a new appreciation for the frustration RMS expresses regarding the use of the term ""Linux"" rather than ""GNU/Linux"". Without the GNU toolchain nothing would work, including the Linux kernel, so I can see why RMS might feel like Tyrion Lannister after the Battle of the Blackwater when people just say ""Linux"" to refer to the entire system.

I knew before starting this project that the word ""buffalo"" could be repeated 8 times to form a grammatically correct sentence. I learned that the same thing can be said for the word ""dependency"". I've always liked apt-get, but I've taken dependency resolution for granted, and I've gotten sloppy as a result. Before starting LFS I couldn't understand how those Slackware folks could think that the absence of a feature is itself a feature. I think I get it now. Do you know off the top of your head if you have libxml2 installed? I do.

the power of conf files is not to be underestimated. What can take 45 minutes of google-fu to solve through the tools in the fancy new Cinnamon Mint Menu (no hate intended to you Mint folks, I'm currently running Maya on one of my machines) can probably be fixed with one line in a conf file somewhere on your machine. Knowing which file, and where it is can save a lot of time and frustration.

I thought I knew bash before, but I am more confident on the command line now than I have ever been. I used to default to graphical utilities just out of habit, but I can now download and uncompress a tarball on the command line before I even realize I've started typing. I will never again forget if I should be using z,j, or J as an argument with tar.

This is just a short list, there is a lot more that I didn't include. If any of you out there have been thinking about giving LFS a try, I can't think of any reasons why you shouldn't jump right in and get your hands dirty. This has been an awesome experience, and I recommend it to anyone with a little bit of knowledge about GNU/Linux and a desire to learn more.

1359194512.0,385,self.linux,17b64a,PSA: Avoid WD Passport drives.  You can't reformat them for use as just a normal drive with Linux.,633,248,186,http://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/17b64a/psa_avoid_wd_passport_drives_you_cant_reformat/,"After tearing my hair out all evening trying to reformat this stupid drive, it turns out WD has decided to include hidden partitions that make reformatting it almost impossible.  They offer some tools to disable the loading of the hidden partition (if you have access to a windows machine), but even then you still can't recover the space used by the partition.  gParted, Disk Utility, and Testdisk all failed to do anything and I can't even use mkfs.ext4 on the drive directly because it would appear the firmware ""protects"" the disk from being reformatted.

It's beyond infuriating.  WD calls this technology ""Smart Ware"".  Oh the irony.

Here's some more reading for those who are interested: 

http://community.wdc.com/t5/WD-Portable-Drives/Remove-the-VCD-from-my-drive/td-p/7066


**EDIT: Found a way to fix my drive, but it requires a physical Windows box (virtuals won't cut it).**

1. Plug the drive into a Windows box. (Windows 7 64-bit was what I used).

2. Download, install, and run the firmware updater [here](http://www.wdc.com/global/webtracking/index.asp?id=1180&amp;url=http://download.wdc.com/fwupdater/Win/WDFirmwareUpdater.zip).

3. Reboot.

4. Download, install, and run the SmartWare updater [here](http://www.wdc.com/global/webtracking/index.asp?id=1127&amp;url=http://download.wdc.com/smartware/SmartWare_Windows_Upgrader.zip).
You might also need to install .Net from [here](http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=17718).  I'm not even sure if this step is 100% necessary, but it's what I did so I'm listing it.

5. Reboot again.

6. Now search for ""format"" in the windows run box and you should find something like ""create and format drives"".  Select that.

7. Now you should see your drive and it'll show as 2 partitions.  For my 2tb, it was one 32gb RAW and the rest was unallocated.

8. Delete both those partitions. (right click on them and delete)

9. It should now say it's totally unallocated, so just make a new partition and format it to NTFS and you're good to go.

I'm now able to read and write to it from my linux box so that was good enough for me, but I'm sure I could now format it to ext4 if I wanted to.  I'm helping a friend get a Linux based media player setup (micca ep600 g2) which reads NTFS so keeping it NTFS lets him use it with his Windows laptop as well which is plus.

Still, it's ridiculous to have to jump through so many hoops just to use a damn USB drive.

**TL;DR; Save yourself the headache and avoid the WD Passport (WDBY8L0020BBK-01) get the [Seagate](http://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Backup-Portable-External-STBU1000100/dp/B00829THO6/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1359262752&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=seagate+external+hard+drive) instead.

1282329922.0,355,self.linux,d3jss,Six months ago I wrote about how I turned my whole office to Linux... here's an update...,562,207,241,http://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/d3jss/six_months_ago_i_wrote_about_how_i_turned_my/,"A few people have asked me how it went, so I'll just answer everyone's questions here...

**Are you still running Linux or do you regret it?**
Yes I'm still with Linux. Overall, I don't regret my decision. But there are times where I realize had I been running Windows some things would be easier, but I also know that Windows had its own share of problems- Which is why I stress that *overall* I'm happier with Linux.

**What kind of business is this?**
We're a local news company. My staff consists of editors, writers, art designers, photographers, production managers (for layout), business managers and a few other positions.

*Please note that the designers and business managers weren't put on Linux. The designers are trained to use photoshop, and the business managers need certain Windows programs (which they were trained to specifically use for their profession). Maybe one day in the future I'll look towards putting them on Linux too. ..or hiring people who know how to.

**Was it a bumpy road?**
Somewhat, but mostly because I decided to not even hire an IT person to deal with little things (maybe I'm a bit over confident in my computer skills but I haven't required one yet). But the problems that arrive in office, are so minor that people would probably realize it's faster to just ask me than to bother with IT anyway. Little problems like just yesterday: ""why isn't open office spell check working"" (they had the wrong language set) are big hurdles for some. It takes me a few seconds to fix, but I receive questions maybe once a week and find myself annoyed at how sometimes the most simple of tasks take a few minutes out of the work day for some people when I'm not around. On the other hand, I guess that time could be considered part of the ""training"" (I provided very little training, as we only were using word-processors, firefox, and gimp.) Regardless, an IT person could probably be handy.

**Did you decide to upgrade the computers to 10.04 or kept 9.10?**
I kept it at 9.10. 10.04 only offered me enough incentive to switch on my own personal computer, but not for business. Especially now that my staff seems to be getting the hang of 9.10.

**Did lots of your workers ask Windows back?**
Only one Mac user requested Windows back. Actually, I found the most resistance from the Mac users at first. Eventually most liked Linux on par with the Windows users. One Mac guy never did but he was a very stubborn individual anyway. And he chose to do all his work on his Macbook. ... so he never even got a chance to get to know Linux. 
 
**How's compatibility with Microssoft Office?**
Not bad, especially now that OpenOffice accepts .docx files. At first we had a rule that people can only use .doc files, which lead to a few re-submitted documents. I recall once or twice people complained about formatting, but it wasn't a big enough deal... iirc formatting issues happened between different versions of MS Word as well.

**Has anyone been ""converted"" into using Linux**
Yes, actually. Two of my workers did. The switch had to do more with their personal computers at home running slow or not at all under Windows and them not wanting to buy new computers.. so they decided to give Linux a try instead. In fact, I just remembered one of them still hasn't returned my 9.10 CD I lent him.. oh well.

**Biggest problems with Linux??**
In my last post I said that I let the designers/production managers keep their Macs as I knew that they required photoshop more than the average worker may need MS Office. They were the only people in my office, along with business managers, that used an OS other than Linux. So I think I avoided the biggest problem right from the get go. Had I put the designers on Linux...well, I'd probably have to re-hire new designers.

I think the biggest problem was the little problems that came up periodically. Like ""Oh how do I stop Office from autoformatting"" (backspace) and those types of questions. As I mentioned, I basically did the IT for our office rather than hiring a guy... I don't know, the problems seem so minor and far in between that I only feel like hiring an IT guy when I need something major..otherwise, we're a small business and I can do it myself and save money that way. Again, let me stress that I don't think I know anywhere near as much as professional IT people, I just know enough to get a network of computers working with each other.

**Do you see any problems happening in the future?**
A problem I can foresee happening that I've luckily avoided is driver compatibility. One of my home PCs ubuntu can't recognize the broadcomm wireless driver.. I've tried everything with ndiswrapper, but it's just not working. I would be pulling my hair out if this happened at the office. So one thing I have to constantly keep in mind is to try out hardware on linux before I make a mass purchase.

**Any programs which have streamlined production flow?**
Hmm.. as in ones people don't usually mention? I liked a few opensource alternatives to googlewave, they're in the ubuntu store. I like Scribus, and wish my designers would try it before we buy the next CS* version..but that'll be a long time.

I also really like [Voxforge](http://www.voxforge) which is an open source speech-recognition software. To have a program which can convert audio files to text would be amazing for journalists, and I find myself checking up on their project from time to time. Actually, if every redditor would say these [10 phrases](http://www.voxforge.org/home/read) , then speech recognition on Linux would be incredible.

**Any bad crashes?**
There was one due to a poor hard disk failure, not really Ubuntu's fault.. Ubuntu detected it while Windows didn't.

**How well do you know Linux or Ubuntu?**
No more than I knew how to use Windows. I think someone should only try this if they've used Ubuntu (or any distro) for a year or so and maybe on different computers. Or at the very least have learnt how to troubleshoot problems by themselves using Google/Ubuntu forums, or can at least hire an IT guy who will do it for them - because you probably will come across hiccups. Other than that, if you're able to run it on your pc and you're familiar with all the software you'll be using.. then I think you can give it a try.

.. I went through my inbox to answer everyone's questions, if I missed anything let me know.

i've been using linux for years, but tweaks like this one never cease to impress me.

*Bad Memory HowTo*

So.. Memtest tells you have bad ram! write down the memory addresses that return errors in memtest. then let's fix them.

 Here are your easy options:

1- Buy new ram

2- Turn off everything after the bad memory

3- Turn off just the memory around the bad memory

&gt;i chose solution 3

You have to edit the /etc/default/grub file Of course... you have to have admin rights, so launch the editor you worship with sudo.

Now... you will se something like this:

    # If you change this file, run 'update-grub' afterwards to update
    # /boot/grub/grub.cfg.

    GRUB_DEFAULT=0
    GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0
    GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_QUIET=false
    GRUB_TIMEOUT=""10""
    GRUB_DISTRIBUTOR=`lsb_release -i -s 2&gt; /dev/null || echo Debian`
    GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=""quiet splash memmap=5M\\\$970M""
    GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=""""



save the file and run

sudo update-grub

this will ignore the 5MB of RAM above 970M (memmap=5M\\\\\$970M)

&gt;mfw it worked

i now have 1996MB of RAM instead of 2000, but the system is stable again.",,False,,t5_2qh1a,1339387252.0,,,True,t3_uuqxx,http://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/uuqxx/linux_bad_memory_howto/,

1293693166.0,320,self.linux,etiv2,I'm just tired of being forced to buy the OS with my preferred HW. My letter to Lenovo support:,507,187,278,http://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/etiv2/im_just_tired_of_being_forced_to_buy_the_os_with/,"I just tried to buy a Lenovo laptop without windows installed on it or a refund - it was a no go. So here is my letter to them 


Dear Lenovo support,

Our company is looking into buying a new laptop till the end of the year. I would like to buy a Lenovo T510 however the requirement to purchase an apparently inseparable windows license together with the model is holding me back to take advantage of some of the very attractive sales offers at the moment.


I have been a IBM/Lenovo user since the beginning of my professional life, at the time as a system engineer for a German IBM partner, mainly selling and deploying IBM AIX servers, where all employees were supplied with Thinkpads. Since then, convinced by the quality and durability of IBM/Lenovo products I have been personally buying Thinkpads continuously for the past 10 years and I have owned the models 3?0, A21, X41, T43p, T400. I am promoting Lenovo products to colleagues and friends in case they do require to run a Windows operating system anyways. Just recently I purchased for my current company a Lenovo Thinkserver TD230 with dual Xeon Processors for our in house development which I was able to purchase without an operating System preinstalled. Because of this it seems unlikely to me that the bundling of a windows license to a computer is a technical necessity and my choice of 'no' operating system if remembering correctly made a difference of between ca 100 CAD and almost half of the total value of a basic TD230 server


Our company, apart from one virtual machine running WinXP for compatibility testing is not using any Microsoft products internally, partly because it doesn't add any value to our business and partly out of moral concerns due to our perceived hostile attitude of Microsoft towards customer choice, open and free standards as well as compatibility between existing standards in the past and present. These compatibility problems have also proven to add additional costs for our customers due to the additional testing required to ensure compatibility with some Microsoft products (ref: OOXML + poor web standard support of previous IE versions, http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20101219121621828). 


With the purchase of a Thinkpad laptop the included windows license and it's associated cost cannot be put to use in our company and cannot be sold on either. It compares to me to the equally frustrating experience where a customer orders a tailor made suit and is forced to buy along with it a misfit shirt with your name printed on it.

Additionally, the amount payed for the unsuitable license will be transferred to a company which does not seem to operate on the same set of core values as our company when it comes to customer choice. Since I can customize a Lenovo laptop with more options than a Thinkserver but not with an option of 'no windows' for the operating system, this suggests to me that the OEM licensing contracts between Lenovo and Microsoft for business laptops may be exclusive. Hence, this seems to confirm my above mentioned concerns about the business practices employed, by disallowing customer choice in a presumably easily providable area. Ironically it also seems that the beneficiary company through their employed practices raises the price of products for our clients, and my purchase on top of this would be wrongly registered as 'another happy windows user' in the Microsoft sales statistics. 


While shopping for my previous Thinkpad I discussed my wish to not purchase the Windows operating system with one of your sales representatives and we were able (after some discussion) to agree on a 'Return Prevention Refund' of CAD 100 as a refund for the not to be used Windows Vista Version already installed on the machine. Today unfortunately I was not able to reach such an agreement. While there are documented cases where customers are able to return their windows licenses after they purchased their product (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_refund#Lenovo) at this moment I am not willing to go through this time consuming and often frustrating process of returning something I do not want to purchase from you in the first place.


With this letter I'm hoping that you can provide me with a solution where I can buy a Thinkpad product and:

1) register with Lenovo as a client who does not want to purchase a windows license bundled with the computer (of whom I don't appear to be the only one judging from comments during my earlier conversation with your sales representative) 

2) receive a discount in exchange for the windows license applied to the sales contract without the need to go through a lengthy after sales return process.

While my familiarity with the Thinkpad line would make a depart difficult for me I have nonetheless started requesting information on alternative laptop brands without the requirement to purchase a windows license together with the base model. 

I would be grateful for a reply and even more for a suitable offer.

With kind regards,

And the best part was, we didn't have to have anyone touch the machine.  It was all done from my desk and an ssh session.  It felt pretty damn good getting it upgraded knowing full well that I was one typo away from making it unreachable.   Yet another awesome reminder of the flexibility and power of Linux.

EDIT:
This [article](http://wiki.debian.org/DebianInstaller/Remote) (not mine) should be enough for those who don't need to install on a machine with more than one interface.

But, since I needed to worry about which IP address was bound to which physical interface, here's my [write-up](http://forums.debian.net/viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=54242#p313270).

I installed Ubuntu 11.10 on Friday afternoon, so I would hopefully get used to Unity before Monday morning.  Worst decision of my computing life.  Every time I use it, I want to throw my computer across the room.

## The dock

The _last_ place I want a UI element that interacts by just mouse position is on the left hand of my screen.  Every time I try to interact with anything that happens to be on the left-hand part of the screen, the dock shows up, covering up what I actually wanted to do, making me move the cursor away from the edge of the screen, wait half a second, and then slowly and carefully move my cursor to where I originally wanted, making double-sure that I don't accidentally touch the edge of the screen, because if I do, that costs me about a second extra of interacting with the desktop environment.

Now, if the dock had only been moveable, I would have bitched less about it, but [Mark Shuttleworth](https://bugs.launchpad.net/unity/+bug/668415/comments/2) has declared that it won't, because it doesn't meet with their ""broader design goals"".

Also, in 11.04, I seem to remember that making the dock permanent was possible, but short of hacking around in CCSM, I can't find any option for making the dock visibility always-on.

Add to it that the dock placement being uncustomizable by design completely falls apart once you connect multiple screens to your computer, as does the global application menus, and Ubuntu button.  Having it stuck in some place of what Ubuntu considers the primary display isn't going to work. Not when you place the secondary display to the left, over, or to the right of the primary display.  And, placing the primary display over my secondary one just doesn't work - this is a laptop.  I can't rip the screen off from the rest of the machine, and place it above my monitor.  

I can't imagine that this would only affect me either. I can't be the only software developer in existence that uses Ubuntu, has a laptop, and an extra monitor provided.

## Lenses

So, lenses are, in principle, a good idea, because they provide a relatively touch-friendly means of interacting with the environment, in the case that a user has a touch device.  The problem is that this is a desktop OS, and the amount of touch-enabled devices Ubuntu is installed on is miniscule, compared to normal desktops and laptops, so it's really optimized for the wrong use case.

Also, what's the point of having something touch-friendly in the UI, when you have that piece-of-shit immovable sidebar that depends on hovering a cursor on a random part of the screen. If you're using touch, you're not going to have a cursor.

But, what's so rage-inducing about the system with lenses is that about 30 years of standard means of interacting with the UI has been completely disregarded. Open a lens, _any_ lens, but for extra amusement, I'm going to suggest the ""Run application"" lens.  Now, type something into it.  When you're done typing, you would expect that pressing ""Tab"" would move you to the ""Results"" part of the lens?  Guess what, it doesn't.  It takes you to the ""Search Files &amp; Folders"" lens - and you now have no way of getting back to the ""Run application"" lens.  

This behaves like exactly _no_ user interface I've used since I first started using a WIMP UI in 1985 or so.  It's inconsistent with how form and application dialogs behave on exactly every other remotely popular operating system or desktop environment, ever.

## Synaptic and Software Center

I _do_ understand that most users want something simpler than synaptic.  

What I don't understand is why synaptic has to be put on the unsupported list, and probably removed entirely from the repositories by 12.04 or 12.10 - if you're actually looking to install libraries, and want to view dependencies and explore a package, it's often simpler than using apt(itude).

The new software center doesn't accomodate any of that - it looks like a cheap storefront, where you're funneled through the items that Canonical wants to sell you.  Sure, it's simpler when you never do anything like a software developer might, but it's too dumbed down for any remotely advanced user.

## Music

I realize that Canonical are trying to get some revenue from their users and all, but why does music have to be on the computer's front row? I'm trying to get shit done, not buy MP3's.  Also, whenever I listen to music, I'm not going to use Banshee. Ever. I'd rather be trapped with that steaming pile of shit called iTunes.  Making my media keys suddenly not work in Quod Libet in 11.10. Smooth. I'm still not going to use Banshee.

1371302348.0,299,self.linux,1gechf,CrunchBang - I got my mind blown,431,132,168,http://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1gechf/crunchbang_i_got_my_mind_blown/,"Hello there,
I'll just tell you a story in my not really that mildly impressive English skills. If you can't stand these anymore, you can jump to the TL/DR at the end.

My first Linux distribution was and still is Ubuntu 12.04. Before that, I used Windows XP. When I changed to Ubuntu it was kind of an epiphany for me: It was easy to use, fast enough and felt really smooth. Additionally it looked pretty cool. So with the help of /r/linux and a lot of other websites, my relationship with Linux started to grow. I only used XP that I still had on another hard drive if something just didn't want to work. When the old harddrive finally died, it wasn't a big deal for me. I fully jumped over to Linux and I noted that it was gone from GRUB and I couldn't access it anymore but I didn't really miss it. I liked Ubuntu. Everything of it. Even Unity (what seems to be hated a lot). But recently a lot of the choices Canonical has made regarding Ubuntu kind of creep me out. So I went to Distrowatch and /r/DistroHopping to see, where I could go.
After a little bit of looking around I thought, Debian would be a good idea but reading a lot about it, it seemed to be a huge act to configure it to my liking. So I stayed with Ubuntu a little longer until I would have time to move. Then, I was a bit curious about that ""crunchbang"" I had seen in the search panel of Distrowatch (It really stood out between the other names). I downloaded an image and testet it out in virtual box. ""Looks alright, let's test it on actual hardware"", I thought and copied on a USB drive. And this is the point, where I got my mind blown:

It was nimble, elegant and very intuitive! In my opinion even better than Ubuntu in terms of usability. Since it is also based on Debian I wouldn't have to disclaim the huge library of .deb packages available.
And it worked ""out of the box"" just like Ubuntu did and what XP didn't.
Compared to Openbox and tint2, Unity feels bulky and slow. For me, that's it. I am moving in the upcoming days. Doesn't seem to be a big deal after all.

TL/DR: Crunchbang beats Ubuntu for me.
