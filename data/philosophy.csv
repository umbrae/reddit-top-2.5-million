But when I see completely well thought out posts and reasoned logic being downvoted to oblivion, it just makes me hate this sub and everyone in it.

***YOU SHOULD NOT DOWNVOTE BECAUSE YOU DISAGREE, EVER. THE ONLY TIME YOU SHOULD DOWNVOTE IS WHEN A PERSON IS LEGITIMATELY NOT ADDING TO THE DISCUSSION OR IS OBVIOUSLY TROLLING.***

I'm very close to unsubscribing from this sub. I'm sick of the idiots who can't handle having their beliefs questioned with well reasoned arguments.

An important part of being a philosopher is recognizing the human condition for what it is and to ***actively fight against those tendencies***. In short, it is to ***actually try your best*** to fully consider, ponder, and ""try out"" believing other positions to get a much better grasp on what another position entails.

I would say we should remove downvotes altogether but I know that probably won't happen in this sub, there are too many subscribers. It's really baffling to me, though. The heart and soul of philosophy is rational discourse with full consideration for opposing positions. The majority of people in this sub do not exemplify this attitude at all.

So, be honest with yourself. If you're the type of person that I am targeting with this post, please take some time to ask yourself, when you downvote or attack a person because they take a different position, ""Why exactly am I downvoting/attacking? Is it because my beliefs are being questioned and I don't like that? Or is it because this person legitimately deserves to be silenced...?""

The main one of which is- who out of these *super*men do you agree with? What is the 'best' way to keep the peace? Do the ends justify the means?

Nite Owl- Described by Ozymandias as a 'Boy Scout', his brand of justice stays well within the law. Arrest troublemakers by the safest means possible, and lead by example. His style is basically not sinking to the level of criminals.

The Comedian- Deeply believes all humans are inherently violent, and treats any trouble makers to whatever means he sees fit, often being overly violent. Dismisses any 'big plans' to try and solve humanity's problems as he thinks none will ever work.

Rorschach- Uncompromising law enforcer, treats any and all crime exactly the same- if you break the law it doesn't matter by how much.  Is similar to The Comedian and remarked that he agreed with him on a few things, but Rorschach takes things much more seriously. A complete sociopath, and his views are so absolute (spoiler!) that he allowed himself to be killed because he could not stand what Ozymandias had done at the end of the story.

Ozymandias- started out as a super-charged version of Nite Owl, but after years of pondering how to help humanity he ultimately decides (spoiler!) to use Dr Manhattan's power to stage attacks on every major country in the globe and thus unite everyone against a common enemy, at the cost of millions of lives.

So of those, whose methodology would you go with?

It is to philosophy what /r/politics is to politics: non-conducive towards questioning and learning nor towards view point sharing. The community (whether at large or a dedicated minority) is biased heavily against those would come here to think, to learn, and postulate. There is coaching and correcting here, instead of encouragement and direction. Comments and posts are deemed all to easily ignorant and unintelligent, and down voted, responses and correction (fact wise or attempted conversions between school of thought included) are regularly condescending and malicious. This is not a place that celebrates philosophy or encourages growth (of logic skills, etc). Had any of us not had the free will of mind to ponder the world and come *freely* to the conclusions we have come to, or had any of us not received encouragement and direction towards free thinking and deduction then we would not, better or worse, be who we are as individuals today. To so overtly stifle and repress natural thought, curiosity, inquiry and the very mechanisms that built the defining philosophies we love to read, is shameful, to my mind. I am ashamed of this community. And I will be judged, down voted, I will receive the same hateful orange red i received over the innocent comments I've provided, on every account that I've had, I will no doubt endure the criticisms of the community at some inane factor of my delivery, or formatting, but I cannot sit idly by knowing full well the capacity Reddit has to engender eureka moments, and knowing that what should be the ideal place to share and grow is in fact, a waste of time.

Aside from this being a matter of common courtesy, we're linked to by /r/suicidewatch and we may, therefore, have the odd genuinely vulnerable poster here. I can't speak about the other moderators, but I for one would like to minimise the probability that someone might kill themselves due to comments in this sub-reddit. As such, if you encourage suicidal behaviour - you will be banned.

If you are reading this and feel suicidal; please, take a look at /r/suicidewatch - it's a sub-reddit specifically designed to help, and they have links and phone numbers to other groups which can assist you. We're going to be adding a link to /r/suicidewatch in the sidebar, as well, so anyone who needs it in the future will be aware of it.

One last thing; this is *not* a blanket ban on discussion of suicide. It's a topic that has a long philosophical history, and at least one famous philosopher has asserted that it is the only truly serious philosophical problem. All we're asking is that our users show some sensitivity.

When I was in the army, I received the kind of aptitude test that all soldiers took and, against a normal of 100, scored 160. No one at the base had ever seen a figure like that, and for two hours they made a big fuss over me. (It didn't mean anything. The next day I was still a buck private with KP - kitchen police - as my highest duty.)

All my life I've been registering scores like that, so that I have the complacent feeling that I'm highly intelligent, and I expect other people to think so too. Actually, though, don't such scores simply mean that I am very good at answering the type of academic questions that are considered worthy of answers by people who make up the intelligence tests - people with intellectual bents similar to mine?

For instance, I had an auto-repair man once, who, on these intelligence tests, could not possibly have scored more than 80, by my estimate. I always took it for granted that I was far more intelligent than he was. Yet, when anything went wrong with my car I hastened to him with it, watched him anxiously as he explored its vitals, and listened to his pronouncements as though they were divine oracles - and he always fixed my car.

Well, then, suppose my auto-repair man devised questions for an intelligence test. Or suppose a carpenter did, or a farmer, or, indeed, almost anyone but an academician. By every one of those tests, I'd prove myself a moron, and I'd be a moron, too. In a world where I could not use my academic training and my verbal talents but had to do something intricate or hard, working with my hands, I would do poorly. My intelligence, then, is not absolute but is a function of the society I live in and of the fact that a small subsection of that society has managed to foist itself on the rest as an arbiter of such matters.

Consider my auto-repair man, again. He had a habit of telling me jokes whenever he saw me. One time he raised his head from under the automobile hood to say: ""Doc, a deaf-and-mute guy went into a hardware store to ask for some nails. He put two fingers together on the counter and made hammering motions with the other hand. The clerk brought him a hammer. He shook his head and pointed to the two fingers he was hammering. The clerk brought him nails. He picked out the sizes he wanted, and left. Well, doc, the next guy who came in was a blind man. He wanted scissors. How do you suppose he asked for them?""

Indulgently, I lifted by right hand and made scissoring motions with my first two fingers. Whereupon my auto-repair man laughed raucously and said, ""Why, you dumb jerk, He used his voice and asked for them."" Then he said smugly, ""I've been trying that on all my customers today."" ""Did you catch many?"" I asked. ""Quite a few,"" he said, ""but I knew for sure I'd catch you."" ""Why is that?"" I asked. ""Because you're so goddamned educated, doc, I knew you couldn't be very smart.""

And I have an uneasy feeling he had something there.",,False,,t5_2qh5b,False,,,True,t3_1a3t8y,http://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/1a3t8y/what_is_intelligence_anyway_isaac_asimov/,

If this thread gets enough feedback I'll take that as a yes, in which case we should decide on an article and reconvene in a week. I can suggest the first one just to get us started if it will make things easier. If anybody has a good idea for a first article please post a comment though.

If nobody else wants to, though, then I guess it's okay.jpg with me.

http://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/1doab8/to_a_daoist_the_trolley_problem_is_not_a_problem/

The article is total misinterpretation of Daoism, mistranslates Daoist concepts, and is all in all terribly short-sighted and gives only a surface explanation to Daoist philosophy.

Firstly, it's important to remember that the Daodejing is first and foremost a political book - it describes how to best run a state/organise a society. So, to say a Daoist wouldn't care about the trolley problem should seem instantly sketchy, seeming as Daoist writers wrote an entire book about how to care for society.    

Secondly *wu wei* does not literally mean 'non-action', but is best understood as 'no **unnatural** action'. In The Daodejing, unnatural action would be actions like warfare, or overly high taxes. These were seen as unnatural because they overtly interfered in the daily lives of the common people, making their lives more difficult and more complicated. Political Daoism is concerned with making the common people more spontaneous (*ziran*) so they can better follow the *dao* (way). Following the *dao* would supposedly bring a level of happiness and prosperity to society (again, showing direct, worldly concern for human beings). 

Thirdly, the example from The *Zhuangzi*, where Zhuangzi cries when his wife dies but then is oddly fine with it has nothing to do with the trolley example. Zhuangzi is happy quickly after his wife's death because he realises death is a natural, unavoidable part of life. However, just because he is ok with death doesn't mean he would allow his wife to die on a train track. Obviously he would save his wife that he loved, and this would be quite a 'natural' (*wu wei* compatible) action.

So, IMHO, the Daoist would save the group at the expense of the single person. That being said, it is true that Daoists were aware that 'you never know what will happen' (i.e. one of that group might be the next Hitler). But, the fact remains that even if we disagree over this final point, the idea that the Daoist wouldn't care because he believes in 'non-action' is just ridiculous.

Let's see if we can explain something about the character of Good Guy Greg and his relevance or meaning on reddit and in our societies. 

I will just write some hypotheses to seed your discussion!

* Greg's seemingly mundane, worldly, or even trivial acts of generosity, caring, and humility make him a more relatable moral example than other heroes.
* Greg is emphatically not a prophet: he practices with no interest in preaching.
* Greg is not only ""good"" in what Nietzsche might call a ""moral"" sense; his goodness is also an aptitude, an inventiveness, an intelligence.
* With Good Guy Greg in mind, the formulations of morality inherited from classical philosophy, Christianity, and renaissance humanism appear somewhat stodgy, clumsy, and in some ways seriously misguided.
* The internet popularity of the Good Guy Greg meme is of sociological importance.
* The concept ""good guy"" is a good example of the Aristotelian concept of virtue: to be a ""guy"" is to have a certain role or task, and a ""good guy"" is simply someone who is truly good at being a guy.
* Goodguyness is a conception of morality that is not narrowly subjective or objective — neither arbitrary and personally chosen nor ahistorical and platonically given, but societal and culturally produced.

So uh... What do you think reddit, is there any philosophical value to this meme? Should our ethics professors share a joint with Good Guy Greg now and then? Is it reasonable and possible to place this humble meme in a larger context?

And we still have going into our common sense the 19th century myth, which succeeded the ceramic myth in Western history – I call it 'The Fully Automatic Model': Man is a little germ that lives on an unimportant rock ball, that revolves about an insignificant star on the outer edges of one of the smaller galaxies. But on the other hand, if you think about that for a few minutes… I am absolutely amazed to discover myself on this rock ball, rotating around this spherical fire… it’s a very odd situation! And the more I look at things, I cannot get rid of the feeling that existence is quite weird.

You see, a philosopher is sort of intellectual yokel who gawks at things that sensible people take for granted. And sensible people say, existence, it’s nothing at all, just go on and do something. See, this is the current movement in philosophy, 'logical analysis', which says: you mustn’t think about existence, it’s a meaningless concept. Therefore, philosophy has become the discussion of trivia. No good philosopher lies awake nights, worrying about the destiny of Man, and the nature of God, and that sort of thing. Because a philosopher today is a practical fellow who comes to the university with a briefcase at 9:00 and leaves at 5:00. He 'does philosophy' during the day, which is discussing whether certain sentences have meaning and if so what, and – as William Earle said in a very funny essay – he would come to work in a white coat if he thought he could get away with it.

The problem is: he’s lost his sense of wonder. Wonder is in modern philosophy something one mustn’t have… it’s like enthusiasm in 18th century England: very bad form. But you see, I don’t know what question to ask when I wonder about the universe. It isn’t a question that I’m wondering about, it’s a feeling that I have...Because I cannot formulate the question that is my wonder. The moment my mouth opens to talk about it I suddenly find I’m talking nonsense.

Often, it seems, people are more interested in pointing out a fallacy somebody's made than actually countering what they say (which, ironically, is a fallacy itself, the fallacy fallacy). People love to get in a swift jab at an argument just because it has a fallacy, but often, pointing out a strawman or slippery slope does nothing to actually counter an argument, it's simply pedantry or a means of escaping a good point.

Secondly, people are quick to talk about Nietzsche or Plato or Aristotle in an argument, hoping that their argument will be stronger simply due to the name-drop without any actual substance to their points. I've often thought that there may be a negative correlation between how many times a person name-drops in an argument and how good they are at actually arguing. It seems like something a pseudo-intellectual would do, not a real philosopher. Obviously, there's nothing wrong with name-dropping per se, it's just that it is often accompanied by arrogance, smugness, and a sense of intellectual superiority.

I hate to criticise this sub, as I actually think that it is one of if not the best sub on reddit, but it just appears to me as though people are less interested in the philosophy, and more interested in appearing intelligent or knowledgeable.

When life begins, we are tender and weak.
 
When life ends, we are stiff and rigid.

Are soft and pliable in life, dry and brittle in death.

So the soft and supple are the companions of life,

Whilst the stiff and unyielding are the companions of death.

An army that cannot yield will be defeated.

A tree that cannot bend will crack in the wind.

Thus, by nature's own decree,

The hard and strong are defeated,

Whilst the soft and gentle are triumphant.


**EDIT:** So, after waking up this morning and re-reading what I wrote in the preface to the verse, I understand where I went wrong. Didn't mean to say any of that matter-of-factly, its just IMHO. I first read this text in a really bad time in my life, and it kind of embedded itself into the fashion of reflecting upon society and the human condition (I'm sure 2 years of psychology had nothing to do with that...).

Really, I could have just posted the verse. I love the commentary &amp; discussion, but I always feel like a fool when my words so effectively misinterpret my intentions.

In physics, we don't use words that we don't fully and completely define (to within an accuracy needed for whatever is being discussed).  *Even if we don't fully understand them*.  It doesn't mean that everyone agrees on which definition to use, or that there is only one definition, but that if there is any ambiguity, the physicist simply states which definition they are using.

This was the only source I could find. Philosophy is not listed there, but I've recently watched a documentary where philosophy department students were protesting against the university administration for shutting the department down. Art students were also struggling too due to S.Korean governments' 'university ranking system', which was ranked heavily depending on the students' employment rate after graduation. It is difficult for art students to find jobs, and thus art universities/departments are prone to being labeled as ""inefficient universities.""


""A country without basic departments(subjects) is without future"". This was one of the protest signs that rang a bell in my head.

They're going to actively seek jobs where their department is not dying all around them. I'll have no access to recent journals, to recent research. I won't be able to stay on here if I'm to watch my course crumble around me, but I love this university and I love the friends I've made here.

A university down the road have shut down their Sociology department in less than 48 hours, given all the students a reading list and told them to gtfo to the library. The cuts are starting to have a serious effect on British universities, in a big way. This needs publicity. We're staging protests and putting up posters and signing petitions, we're currently also in talks with certain members of the University Senate who are the ones voting on this decision. The money has to come from somewhere, and they think they can save £300k from closing the department.

Any support, any publicity I can gain is crucial. We have less than a week to protest the closure.

I'm afraid this is quite short and sweet, but if this doesn't get downvoted into oblivion, I'll keep it updated.

Why is this uplifting to me? Well, do you ever think about life and everything, and come to the rational conclusion that it's all entirely pointless? I do. I think too much about everything, I see hypocrisy everywhere, including myself, and I probably couldn't be more misanthropic if I tried. 

But what Nietzsche says here, I think, is that you don't *have* to convince yourself there is a point to it all. You don't need to. There is an antidote to the feelings that come from the realisation that you're alone in the universe. And it's simply art, and music. Beauty.

I don't know if this works for anyone else, but when I feel like shit, I can think about this quote and remind myself that beauty exists in the world.

Some are short bite-sized chunks while others go moderately in-depth on philosophical topics. For serious users, there are even a few excellent full course podcasts available on iTunes University; listening to such a series takes many, many hours, but it can be well worth the time investment if you're fully interested in the topic.

*Short-form philosophy podcasts:*

* **Philosophy Bites** ([itunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/philosophy-bites/id257042117), [blog](http://philosophybites.com/)): 15-20 minute weekly interviews of philosophers on philosophical topics by David Edmonds and Nigel Warburton. Highly recommended.
* **The 10-Minute Puzzle** ([site](http://www.abdn.ac.uk/philosophy/nip/tenminutepuzzle/)): 10 minute sporadic introductory discussions on philosophical puzzles by Federico Luzzi and Aidan McGlynn. Highly recommended.
* **Ethics Bites** ([itunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/ethics-bites-open2.net/id274548950), [site](http://www.open.edu/openlearn/whats-on/ethics-bites)): 15-20 minute sporadic interviews of philosophers on ethical dilemmas by David Edmonds and Nigel Warburton. Highly recommended.
* **Morality in the Real World** ([itunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/morality-in-the-real-world/id391891162), [site](http://commonsenseatheism.com/?p=11626)): 20 minute sporadic episodes on desirism by Alonzo Fyfe and Luke Muehlhauser. Shows the thinking process of specifically explicating a theory over time, making changes along the way. (Note that desirism is not a theory I subscribe to.)
* **The Big Ideas** ([itunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-big-ideas/id450732810)): 10 minute sporadic mini-introductions on the main ideas in philosophy.

*Medium-length philosophy podcasts:*

* **The History of Philosophy Without Any Gaps** ([itunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/history-of-philosophy/id396903391), [blog](http://www.historyofphilosophy.net/)): 20-30 minute weekly discussions on the history of philosophy by Peter Adamson. Highly recommended.
* **Elucidations** ([itunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/elucidations-university-chicago/id323127331), [site](http://philosophy.uchicago.edu/podcasts/elucidations.html)): 25-45 minute weekly interviews of philosophers on philosophical topics by Matt Teichman and Mark Hopwood.
* **The Moral Maze** ([itunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/moral-maze/id478257574), [site](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qk11)): 45 minute weekly heated debates on practical moral issues by non-philosophers.
* **The Philosopher's Zone** ([itunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/philosophers-zone-program/id135353439), [site](http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/philosopherszone/)): 25 minute weekly discussions on philosophical topics by the late Alan Saunders. (A replacement host has not yet been chosen; episodes resume in 2013.)
* **The Public Philosopher** ([itunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/michael-sandel-public-philosopher/id514253822), [site](http://www.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/series/r4sandel)): 45 minute sporadic talks by Michael Sandel. Includes a lot of audience participation.
* **Minerva** ([itunes](https://itunes.apple.com/podcast/minerva/id504134963), [site](http://www.minerva-podcast.com/)): 30 minute monthly episodes on major philosophical topics.

*Long-form philosophy podcasts:*

* **The Partially Examined Life** ([itunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/partially-examined-life-philosophy/id318345767), [blog/forum](http://www.partiallyexaminedlife.com/)): 2 hour weekly discussions on philosophical readings aimed at a moderately informed audience. Their forum includes reading groups where listeners can discuss topics more in-depth, which is perhaps the most awesome thing ever. Highly recommended.
* **Why? Philosophical Discussions About Everyday Life** ([itunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/kcnd-fm-why-philosophical/id311851745), [site](http://www.philosophyinpubliclife.org/Why/)): 1 hour bi-weekly interviews on philosophical topics with&amp;nbsp;Jack Russell Weinstein. The host is very good at asking great questions of guests that cut to the heart of philosophical positions. Highly recommended.
* **Philosophy Talk** ([site/forum](http://philosophytalk.org/)): 1 hour weekly discussion on philosophical topics with a call-in audience. Their podcast feed goes through iAmplify, which is terribly confusing and irritating, but each week's episodes are free to download if you can figure it out. Be aware that past episodes are not freely available, making this show impossible to use with philosophy discussion groups.
* **New Books in Philosophy** ([itunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/new-books-in-philosophy/id426208821)): 1 hour biweekly interviews with authors about their newly published books on philosophy. These are easily the most dense of all podcasts listed here, as they go fairly in-depth on specific topics — but every episode is accessible to a moderately well-informed philosophical audience. Unfortunately, the audio quality is not ideal.
* **Philosophy Now** ([itunes](https://itunes.apple.com/podcast/philosophy-now/id487257543), [site](http://philosophynow.org/)): 1 hour sporadic interviews on philosophical topics.
* **Such That Cast** ([itunes](https://itunes.apple.com/podcast/suchthatcast-philosophers/id556756589), [site](http://suchthatcast.com/)): 1 hour monthly interviews with philosophers. Does not focus on specific philosophical problems, but just consists of a freeform conversation between the interviewer and interviewee. This sounds terrible, but is actually really good.

The above is taken from my recent blog entry on [my favorite podcasts](http://www.ericherboso.org/2012/10/my-favorite-podcasts.html). Other great resources on which philosophy podcasts are worth looking into include [Philosopher's Pipe](http://philosopherspipe.com/) and some old r/philosophy posts from [six months ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/rjql0/a_reminder_if_youre_starting_out_in_philosophy/), [one](http://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/f56yh/best_philosophy_podcast/) [year](http://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/kgh6u/can_anyone_recommend_some_great_philosophy/) [ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/h2fqw/anyone_subscribe_to_any_philosophy_podcasts_or/), and [two years ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/dstgf/looking_for_podcast_suggestions/).

I'm hopeful that this admittedly subjective list of the best philosophy podcasts will be useful to some of you. While I personally subscribe to and listen to every episode of each of the above, your personal experience might vary. In any case, feel free to point out any philosophy podcasts I've neglected to mention in the comments.


**Edit**: *Commenters have rightly brought up a few additional podcasts:*

* **In Our Time: Philosophy** ([itunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/in-our-time-archive-philosophy/id463701671), [site](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/features/in-our-time/archive/philosophy)): I completely neglected this podcast in my original list, although I'm subscribed to their [main feed](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/in-our-time-with-melvyn-bragg/id73330895). I apologize for forgetting to list it, but I had categorized In Our Time as a history podcast, not a philosophy one. I do highly recommend this. (Thanks to samiiRedditBot for noticing this omission.)
* **The Thirst** ([itunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-thirst-podcast/id528770037), [site](http://www.thethirstpodcast.com)): I have yet to listen to one of these episodes, but MaceFraser &amp; BottleCap42 in the comments both vouch for this as a good philosophy podcast.

the earth*!

From their misery they sought escape, and the stars were too
remote for them. Then they sighed: ""O that there were heavenly paths
by which to steal into another existence and into happiness!"" Then
they contrived for themselves their bypaths and bloody drafts!

Beyond the sphere of their body and this earth they now fancied
themselves transported, these ungrateful ones. But to what did they
owe the convulsion and rapture of their transport? *To their body and
this earth*! ...

But the body is a sickly thing to them, and gladly would they get out of
their skin. Therefore hearken they to the preachers of death, and
themselves preach back-worlds.

Hearken rather, my brethren, to the voice of the healthy body; it is
a more upright and pure voice.

More uprightly and purely speaks the healthy body, perfect and
square-built; and it speaks of the meaning of the earth.""

(xpost from /r/askreddit)",508,183,509,http://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/wojl9/why_is_intoxication_a_basis_for_inability_to/,"The recent post on the front page (in /r/atheism for some reason) about rape and rape culture got me thinking about two truths that don't seem to add up:

1) Someone (usually a woman) who is inebriated cannot legally consent to sex in most (all?) states. Perhaps more importantly, most people think that it would be morally base to take advantage of someone in such a state.

2) Someone who operates a motor vehicle while inebriated is liable for driving under the influence.

Essentially, we have on the one hand an argument for loss of autonomy, and on the other we have an affirmation of autonomy: you are not responsible for your actions in one instance, but are in the other.

In fact, a common argument -- that someone was responsible for the choices that put them into a state of inebriation -- is valid for the drunk driving situation, but viewed as tasteless and reprehensible in the sex situation. We cannot argue that a woman who decided to get as drunk as she did has a responsibility for her actions through transitivity of identity/autonomy.

So, to cut to the chase: why is this the case? It seems to me either you have autonomy or you don't, and we shouldn't just get to cherry pick based on what's convenient. Why am I wrong?

[Addition: Some have argued that coercion is the defining distinction -- that is, the sexual partner can coerce someone into an act they might otherwise not commit, but a car cannot -- but I can imagine a situation where a friend suggests, ""C'mon man!  You're not drunk.  Besides, we need a ride home!""

Whenever it comes up, it seems like the discussion is inevitably filled with strawman arguments about how human nature is naturally capitalist, or how you can't possibly make everyone equal, or how communism has killed millions of people. These would seem like valid points to some, but for me they were all addressed in my initial stages of studying Marxist theory, so it baffles me how people can still be so uneducated on the subject. Hell, Karl Marx even addressed the human nature thing during his lifetime, and it still remains the most common argument against his theories.

It wouldn't bother me if people actually read Marx and came up with valid criticisms, but most people are content to handwave it away as a childish fantasy based on definitions they've gotten from history textbooks, sometimes even in this very subreddit. Why is Marxism so widely misinterpreted? 

**EDIT:** I feel like I made a grave mistake by mentioning Stalin.

I was not, in any way, trying to endorse the errors that occurred under the Stalinist regime. I was merely pointing to the positive aspects of socialism, such as increasing life quality rates, as a glimpse at the potential of the system.

There are some people who chose to insult me as a person rather than explain to me why I'm wrong. To those people, there's not much I have to say besides fuck you. To the well-mannered, intelligent people who I may have offended by expressing some sentiment of approval for Stalin, I am sorry if you feel that way, but I hope you can see where I'm coming from, even if you don't necessarily agree.

As for my other comments in this thread, I still stick by them, despite whoever may think I'm a sociopath or a troll or whatever. The only thing I want to make clear is that I do not believe the Soviet Union was what a socialist society would look like. I was only trying to say that we should take the positive aspects, repeat them, and learn from the negative ones.

In the upcoming months, some students will begin taking introductory classes in college; others are in high school, but are reading introductory texts on philosophy on their own. There's even a growing number of people outside of high school and college that are sticking their toes in the philosophy pool.

Remember: if you're starting out, you might want to do some investigating on your own before you ask questions. The resources available on the internet are staggering! If I came here for the first time, the first place I'd check out would be the sidebar over there -----&gt;

1. There's a recommended reading list and posting guidelines. Please abide by them, or your submissions will be removed! There's a lot of people that post here for the first time that don't read the guidelines. Have you heard about Van Halen's rule about [brown M&amp;M's](http://www.snopes.com/music/artists/vanhalen.asp)? Think of the rules on the sidebar as a similar check to see if you're using your noggin!

2. I know the search tool on reddit isn't the best, but please check it out! It's very likely that your question has been asked before. 

3. If you have questions that aren't immediately answered by links on the sidebar or searches on reddit, then check out [Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](http://plato.stanford.edu/) or the [Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy](http://www.iep.utm.edu/). There's a very good chance that a professional philosopher has already written pages and pages that answer your question!

If you don't have any specific questions and you just want to learn (who doesn't?), I recommend ...

1. Oxford University's **Philosophy for Beginners**, available on [iTunes](http://itunes.apple.com/itunes-u/philosophy-for-beginners/id381704133#ls=1) or on [their website](http://www.philosophy.ox.ac.uk/podcasts/philosophy_for_beginners).

2. If you're interested in a historical introduction to Ancient Greek and Roman philosophy, then check out the podcast by King's College London: **History of Philosophy Without Any Gaps**, available on [iTunes](http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/history-of-philosophy/id396903391) or [their website](http://www.historyofphilosophy.net/).

4. The podcast [The Partially Examined Life](http://www.partiallyexaminedlife.com) is worth checking out. So is [Conversations from the Pale Blue Dot](http://commonsenseatheism.com/?p=1911) and [PhilosophyBites](http://www.philosophybites.com/).

This has become the greatest source of psychological tension in modern life. We are a generation who constantly checks Reddit and Facebook and can watch TV with no commercials, and reproduction has moved from the top to the bottom of our list of goals as a species. I love learning, thinking, and imagining more than anything, and I enjoy attending class, but I don't have the patience to sit down every day and read a fucking book. Furthermore, our comfortable lifestyle is born from the suffering of others, who don't have the benefits of education and leisure time to contemplate the universe and the self. I have come to understand my identity as an aristocrat, but at same time, I feel like a joke.

I'm currently working on my thesis in the field of Criminal Psychology, which fascinates me more than anything, probably because I grew up in a neighborhood where crime was virtually nonexistent. I like it because it's exciting and unknown, which seems like a pretty vain reason to me.

Sure, I'm happy. I often experience moments of transcendence. I believe in morality and meaning and the importance of life. But I feel as if I'm on a road to nowhere because I don't have the ability to do anything without questioning, and my questions just go deeper and deeper until I have reached oblivion and lethargy, which is such a privileged problem to have. I am crippled not by my socioeconomic situation or physical limits, but by curiosity, which is unheard of to most of the world.

I've made an appointment with a shrink to help me sort out my thoughts (another privilege most people don't get), but I wanted to see if Reddit can help. Who else feels these things, and who has overcome this problem?


EDIT: Thanks for your suggestions. But I want to bring to light one of my inherent problems: I have a really short attention span, and I don't have the capacity to work on anything for very long. I read a lot, but I'm a slow reader and usually space out for long, LONG periods of time whenever I read anything mentally stimulating, going deep in thought about particular parts of the text, sometimes one sentence after the other. I guess this is more of a cognitive issue than an emotional one, so if anyone can help with that, I would appreciate.

Help me out?",351,69,188,http://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/1d51ab/im_a_video_game_designer_trying_to_figure_out_an/,"I'm an indie game designer, and I've been thinking a lot about the ethics of my craft recently. It's been a surprisingly hot topic ever since the boom of social games and microtransactions a few years ago. After I started getting increasingly out of my depth and stumbling around the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, I figured I might get some more direct help here.

Specifically, I've been thinking about stuff like slot machines or other shallow, addictive games. They feel really icky to me, but I'm not entirely sure why. It's not just because they make money. After all, if players get some pleasure out of it, isn't that worth some cost? Yet, even if we were to make our (addictive, totally shallow) game completely free, I'd still feel bad about people sinking time into it. It seems to me like the game exists to rope people in and waste their time, but again, if the players enjoy it, what's wrong?

1. So let's refine this thought experiment a bit more, and put it into more familiar territory: If I were to invent a machine or a drug that would zonk you out and give you some sort of mild empty pleasure for as long as you want at no cost (other than the time), is it a good invention?

2. What if the machine were mildly addictive (enough to make people put in more time than they'd normally want, but not so much it ruins their lives)?

3. Maybe part of what bothers me about this machine is that it is not providing pleasure in a constructive way. A lot of the time, we get pleasure from accomplishment or food or some other presumably beneficial cause. When the pleasure doesn't align with true benefit (like, say, unsafe sex or sugary food or a dangerous drug), we consider that a bad quality. But if the pleasure is not actively harming us (i.e. neutral other than time cost), is it still wrong just because it isn't actively helping? Is there a bright line to draw here?

I don't know. Please help?",,False,,t5_2qh5b,False,,,True,t3_1d51ab,http://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/1d51ab/im_a_video_game_designer_trying_to_figure_out_an/,

I have tried to read his work, specifically Beyond Good and Evil, Thus Spake Zarathustra, and The Genealogy of Morality. I've honestly never really been able to understand Nietzsche beyond the cliche explanations I've heard many times.

- The only understanding I have of Nietzsche, was that first of all contrary to many people's beliefs, Nietzsche wasn't a nihilist and actually was an existentialist. Nietzsche however apparently did a good job at explaining nihilism, and thus this is where the misconception may have been born from. 

- Nietzsche made the concept of the superman. The idea that man is a bridge between ape and the superman. The superman is the person who lives for himself/herself and goes beyond good and evil and all forms of traditional morality. The superman makes up his own morality and his own meaning in his life.

- I don't quite understand this part at all, but I've heard that Nietzsche wanted the culture to turn away from Christianity and turn to Greek romanticism.

- He had a big dislike of the philosophy of Plato and Western Philosophy. Why? I never quite understood this, was it because Plato and Western philosophy put a lot of importance on logic?

- He made the quote ""God is Dead, and we killed him"" which is a really popular quote. Maybe I'm dense, but why is this quote so significant? As an atheist, I acknowledged long before I even knew who Nietzsche was, that God was a concept made up by human beings. EDIT: I forgot to mention that this quote also (or perhaps only) refers to the fact that religion was dying in Western society. Science and the industrial revolution was becoming more important in society, and Nietzsche believed it would ultimately kill religion and it's values. The problem with science in Nietzsche's view was that it did not give any values to people, thus when science kills religion, it would leave people valueless and thus nihilistic.

- Human beings main goal is the will to power. Humans want power because that's what Nietzsche believed we were naturally programmed to follow and that's how nature was.

- He wanted to go back to a morality of master morality rather than slave morality.

Overall to be honest I really don't understand why Nietzsche is so significant. So basically in a nutshell Nietzsche wanted us to be free spirits, be individuals, and to not be sheep. He wanted us to strive for power and to not be sheep that pity themselves with morality such as Christianity.


I feel like I'm being dense and not understanding Nietzsche at all, because if this is all Nietzsche had to say, then I'm not impressed. Yet at the same time I know Nietzsche is extremely popular, so there must be more to him than I am seeing. It's difficult for me to read Nietzsche because his writing style is so poetic and metaphorical, it's not like other philosophers where their line of thinking is clear and logical. I would be really disappointed if Nietzsche was popular mainly because of his writing style and not because of his ideas.

So can anyone else please explain to me Nietzsche more in depth rather than the typical cliche summaries I've read about him over and over again?",,False,,t5_2qh5b,True,,,True,t3_sacep,http://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/sacep/why_is_nietzsche_so_popular/,

I have decided to offer a defense of Indian philosophy with examples and hopefully clear up some perceptions. I will only be talking about Indian and not Chinese or Japanese philosophy, since that is what I know about.

The problem according to BK Matilal is that 

&gt; 'Indian philosophy' has unfortu­nately  come  to  denote  a  group  of  occult  religious  cults,  a  system  of dogmas, and an odd assortment of spirituality,mysticism, and imprecise thinking,   concerned almost exclusively with' spiritual liberation' . Books, pamphlets, and other materials dealing with this theme are quite consid­erable  in  number  and  unfortunately  too  easily  available. 

He then mentions:
&gt;
&gt;The  results  of  recent  research  have  revealed  beyond  doubt  that a 
&gt;considerable portion of Indian philosophy consists of a number of rigor­
&gt;ous  systems  which are  more  concerned with  logic  and  epistemology, 
&gt;with the analysis  and  classification of human knowledge,  than they are 
&gt;with transcendent  states  of  euphoria. Verifications and  rational  proce­
&gt;dures  are  as much  an  essential  part of Indian  philosophical  thinking   as 
&gt;they are in Western philosophical thinking.  Thus,  neglect of the study of 
&gt;Indian   philosophy  in   modern  philosophic   circles  is  obviously   self­
&gt;perpetuating, for no one but the analytical philosophers will ever be able 
&gt;to  recognize  and  make  known  in  Western languages  the counterpart to 
&gt;their  own  discipline. 


Some examples I'd like to mention:

Regarding logic, the Nyaya sutras (2nd century BCE) laid out an epistemological framework defining what knowledge is and how we can obtain it, rules for inference, types of and rules for debate. The Nyaya tradition was a realist school, and they flourished alongside the other schools of thought until the 13th century when a new version ""Navya Nyaya"" was created to answer certain objections.

The debates between Nyaya and others developed logic in India over the years

This school was particularly rigorous and they came up with concepts that resembled Frege's theory of logic.

According to K.K. Chakrobarty:


&gt;In the third part we have shown how the study of the so-called 'restrictive conditions for universals' in Navya-Nyaya logic anticipated some of the developments of modern set theory. [...] In this section the discussion will center around some of the 'restrictive conditions for universals (jatibadhaka) proposed by Udayana. [...] Another restrictive condition is anavastha or vicious infinite regress. According to this restrictive condition, no universal (jati) can be admitted to exist, the admission of which would lead to a vicious infinite regress. As an example Udayana says that there can be no universal of which every universal is a member; for if we had any such universal, then, by hypothesis, we have got a given totality of all universals that exist and all of them belong to this big universal. But this universal is itself a universal and hence (since it cannot be a member of itself, because in Udayana's view no universal can be a member of itself) this universal too along with other universals must belong to a bigger universal and so on ad infinitum. What Udayana says here has interesting analogues in modern set theory in which it is held that a set of all sets (i.e., a set to which every set belongs) does not exist.


It might be interesting to mention that this upgrade came about due to the criticisms of a skeptic known as Sriharsa, who posed the Gettier problems at around 1150 AD, over 800 years before Gettier.

While on the topic of skeptics, the two other famous skeptics are the founder of Mahayana, Nagarjuna, and the skeptic Jayarasi Bhatta.

Nagarjuna lived in the first century AD and is famous for his ideas of sunyata or emptiness, and for showing that all truths and concepts are co-dependent and thus we can never find an unchanging essence of anything, thus showing the impossibility of any ultimate truth.

His work was continued by other famous logicians such as Dharmakirti and Chandrakirti; as well as  Bhavaviveka, who formulated Nagarjuna's writings into a formal syllogistic manner.

Jayarashi Bhatta lived presumably around 800 AD, and in his work Tattvapaplavasimha, he shows, by a method of reductio arguments that all philosophical activity trying to arrive at true knowledge is useless. 


There is also the famous Advaita Vedanta school, which is a monistic school which took sort of an anti realist position which was similar to the Madhyamaka Buddhists. I won't go into detail here.

Apart from them there are also other schools such as

Sankhya (metaphysical dualist)

Yoga (a type of dualist)

Vaisheshika (Atomist school)

Mimansa (realist exegetical school)

Other Buddhist schools like Pudgalavada and Adhidharma

There are also the Jains, who are relativists with regard to truth, and made many important contributions to Indian logic.


In the end, I hope this post arouses some curiosity in the members and I hope that they think about why it is unfair that by p[philosophy we unhelpfully refer to Western Philosophy as the default.

I provide some sources and reading material at the bottom for the curious

Thank you

1372219445.0,271,self.philosophy,1h34uy,In response to a recent downvote brigade: convince me why I should take religious beliefs seriously in the 21st Century.,501,230,811,http://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/1h34uy/in_response_to_a_recent_downvote_brigade_convince/,"To be clear, I mean for intellectual reasons, not practical ones.

Are there any good reasons for accepting religious beliefs or claims as legitimate (read: *true*)?  To my knowledge, religious claims about the nature of the cosmos are not supported (or often even *capable* of being supported or refuted) by empirical evidence.  So while some religious doctrine may demonstrate a degree of internal logical consistency, no religious doctrine to my knowledge is fully consistent with the external observable universe.  This assertion is not at all controversial among scientists.  

One definition of faith is belief in the absence of evidence.  Faith is sometimes regarded as a virtue.  It is even regarded as a source of morality.

I realize that this is not /r/atheism.  *Philosophically*, why should I regard the earnest and impassioned belief in unsupported claims as anything except a hazardous mark of gullibility, stupidity, and infantile wishful thinking?

**EDIT: RESULTS**

Lots and LOTS of comments.  Here is a summary of the arguments that posters have offered:

-1. **[Argument from authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_authority).** Theism has been around a long time, it has been part of philosophy for a long time, take its claims seriously because *Respect. Mah. Authoritah!*  Um. No.

-2. **[Argument from popularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentum_ad_populum).** Billions of people have religious beliefs, so out of respect for *them* we should respect their ideas.  No.  We can respect a person while criticizing specific ideas they have or claims they make.

-3. **Don't be a meanie.**  Religion deserves special treatment because it is important to people.  No.  No other category of ideas gets a free pass from harsh criticism - not political ideas, not scientific ideas, not philosophical ideas, not even personal preferences in art, music, or literature.  Religious beliefs have no special claim to automatic respect.

-4. **Empiricism is overrated, and isn't used in everyday life.**

Nonsense.  Empiricism makes technology possible, so you don't get to say it is useless or meaningless or anything other that stone-cold-amazeballs-awesome *while typing on a computer*.

Moreover, we continuously rely on empiricism.  Our personal models of reality - from the physics of walking, to what is edible and what is not, to how other people will respond to our behavior, and a billion other examples - are all empirical.  They are the cumulative result of our comparing predictions our models make with the external world.  As adults, these models rarely fail.  That's what makes magicians awesome: they have tricks for breaking our personal empirical models of reality.  Science just extends empiricism beyond the reach of everyday human experience.  If walking on the moon were an everyday experience, our ancestors would never have thought it was made of spirits or cheese or whatever else.

OK, on to some more serious responses.

-5. **Empirically-supported claims are no more legitimate that faith-based claims, because empiricism is also based on *a priori* assumptions.**

It is true that empirical knowledge is based on the assumption that consistency is useful.  However, to claim that this puts empirical and faith claims on level footing is to arrive at the fallacy of false equivalence via *reductio ad absurdum*.  Empiricism is special; it has a unique type of self-evident utility.

DivineSleeper explains: ""To refute consistency itself, however, leaves nothing but insanity. You simply cannot actively believe that the universe now will be zero indication of the universe a few seconds from now.""

-6. **Religious beliefs are useful.**

I specifically asked for *intellectual*, not *practical*, arguments for the legitimacy of religious claims about the nature of the cosmos.  Folks ignored this.  Here is the difference:

Religious claims have *practical utility* with respect to an individual's psychology: they sometimes have a pro-social effect on how we feel, think, and behave.  

Empiricism has *epistemic utility*: it allows us to build a framework of claims that is both self-consistent and consistent with the external universe it attempts to describe.  Religious claims appear to have little or no epistemic utility.

-7. **KGDavid says ""If theism is not true, the door is closed on a number of philosophical possibilities ... Whether or not theism is true, its truth or untruth has great consequence on our understanding of morality, epistemology, and ontology.""**

This is a fair point.  But it is also true that if Zeus were real it would have ""great consequence on our understanding of morality, epistemology, and ontology"".  I think the likelihood of both are very close to zero.  Is it worth spending time and energy considering such an unlikely scenario when there is so much other philosophy to learn about?  Not to me.

-8. **Various ontological arguments.**

I find that the [standard objections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontological_argument#Criticisms_and_objections) dispense with these [quite easily](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ontological-arguments/#ObjOntArg).  

The objection that resonates most with me is that causation is meaningless without time, and modern physics seems to suggest that [reality is larger than our own space-time universe](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=7ImvlS8PLIo#t=138s).  Asking what happened before time existed is meaningless: it is like asking what is north of the North Pole.  Without time then causation, creation, and a Creator are similarly meaningless concepts.  This does a good job of obviating the First Cause infinite regress paradox.

People accuse each other of arguing semantics when they:

* ask for someone to clarify what they mean by a particular word;
* suggest that someone is using a word nonstandardly;
* distinguish between two different senses of a word; or
* say anything that has anything to do with language.

But most often, ""arguing semantics"" is thrown out as a vague platitude, as when people accuse academic philosophy as a whole of boiling down to semantic arguments.

When ""semantics"" is used as loosely as it tends to here, the obvious question is what the significance of that observation is supposed to be. After all, I could say that the Kalaam cosmological argument is ""just arguing modus ponens,"" or that the proof that there are an infinitely many primes is ""just a reductio ad absurdum."" But so what? There's nothing wrong with those forms of argument; the fact that I can give them a label hardly changes that. So the same goes for ""arguing semantics."" If you think someone is arguing semantics, you ought not to stop there. Instead, ask what *difference* it makes that that their argument hinges on a distinction, or a particular usage of a word, or what have you. If you find that the real problem is that someone is drawing an *irrelevant* distinction, why not just say that? Far more clear than just accusing them of ""arguing semantics.""

""Semantics"" is the study of meaning. Not questions about the meanings of particular words (""Does doing right mean maximizing happiness?"") but about how words and other signs relate to their meanings in general. When people argue about this topic - for example, when they argue about whether the content of my thoughts depends on their causal history - you could properly say that they are arguing about semantics. But in every example I've actually seen, ""arguing semantics"" is thrown up just to mean that somebody is, in any way at all, paying close attention to a particular word. If that's a problem in some particular case, then do explain why.

The comments are filled with antagonist conversations about overpopulation, selfishness, freedom, responsibility, and so on.  

The ecological facts are quite clear: our planet's ecosystems are in crisis as a consequence of humanity's ecological footprint, and we are already drawing down natural resources at a globally unsustainable rate.  For example, we would require 5 Earths to support 7 billion people living the lifestyle of the average American family of four.  Another example: at current rates, there will be no fish left to catch in the oceans in 35 years.  These are not issues of unfair distribution; they are the hard limits of what our planet is capable of providing. 

Population [is only one variable in the ecological impact function](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_%3D_PAT) that also includes rates of consumption and technological efficiency, so it not the only relevant factor - but it is (by definition) no less important a factor than the other variables in the function.

Given what we know about our planet's limits, I personally think it is morally wrong (i.e. a selfish act with destructive consequences) to have more than two children.

I excused myself and ended the conversation.

In fact, the film is much more than a simple 'brain in a vat' allegory. What is the Matrix? Control.

There is an old anecdote about an experiment involving monkeys. I don't know if this ever an actual experiment or just a story meant to enlighten. Regardless, I mention it now. Five monkeys were placed in a cage and a treat was repeatedly placed in a dish. Each time one of the monkeys went to grab the treat, the other 4 monkeys were sprayed with water. Eventually, when one of the monkeys went for the treat, the other four would beat him up or restrain him before he could get to it; they didn't like being sprayed with the hose. 

Then, the scientists began a rotation; one of the original five monkeys was removed from the cage and replaced with a new monkey. The new monkey liked treats, and had no experience being sprayed with a water hose. When placed in the cage and offered a treat, the new monkey naturally went to grab it. However, the 4 old monkeys would beat up the new monkey to stop him from grabbing the treat and save themselves from being hosed down. This rotation and process continued.

Eventually, all five of the original monkeys were replaced. What is interesting is that the new monkeys were never hosed down, the old monkeys had always prevented the new from getting the treat and, in doing so, prevented the water bath. Yet despite not knowing *why* they prevented each other from claiming the treat, they still did so simply because they created a self-reinforcing system where monkeys get beat up for trying to grab the treat. The monkeys had been trained to train other monkeys, without even realizing it, and without knowing why.

Back to the Matrix.

When Neo, Trinity, Morpheus, et al are adventuring inside the system, one of the biggest threats is other people, the blue-pillers. There are numerous chase scenes where Agents 'take over' blue-pillers in pursuit of red-pillers. In the third film, Agent Smith actually takes over *everyone* in the Matrix in the final battle with Neo.

This, I think, is one of the key points that is often missed in analyses of the Matrix's message. Have you ever seen someone behaving in a manner that just seemed wrong and consequently felt an overwhelming urge to correct said behavior? Without even having a good *reason* to do so? 

Have you yourself ever behaved in a manner that seemed perfectly reasonable *to you*, only to be corrected by someone else in a way that appeared to you as an overreaction?

Have you ever restrained **yourself** from doing something you considered legit, only because you were worried that others would 'correct' you if you did?

The idea was that technology uses humans to continuously invent newer and more complex technology until the technology can reproduce itself and the human becomes obsolete. The human body is in that view nothing more than a way of controlling the environment in order to (from the point of the human) survive, but ultimately control leads to the singularity.

I think that this is very similar to Daniel Quinn's idea that our entire modern agricultural society is nothing more than a doomed way of trying to control our environment. However Quinn argues that we will not succeed in control because it is a vain attempt due to the fact that any control will lead to the need for more control as well as the destruction of the environment which we are trying to control.

So there are basically two scenarios: either the singularity happens and technology manages to reproduce itself or we will fail before that because we self-destroy.

He identifies the issue of his “whole authorship” as “*becoming a Christian*” (*The Point of View*, p. 8; cf. pp. 55-6). In a final draft to his book *For Self-Examination*, he writes: “It is one idea, this continuity from *Either/Or* to Anti-Climacus, the idea of religiousness in reflection” (*Journals and Papers*, vol. 6, §6770). “I hardly need say that by wanting to win people [i.e., to win Christians within Christendom to authentic Christianity] it is not my intention to form a party, to create secular, sensate togetherness; no, my wish is only to win people, if possible all people (each individual), for Christianity” (ibid.). Moreover, in a draft of *Philosophical Fragments*, Kierkegaard’s Johannes Climacus writes, “there has never been an atheist, even though there certainly have been many who have been unwilling to let what they knew (that the God [*Guden*] exists) get control of their minds (*JP*, vol. 3, §3606). 

But if this is so, what can non-Christians, atheists especially, possibly get out of reading Kierkegaard? To this frequently asked question, I offer the following as a starting-point:

1. Kierkegaard is well-known as the “father of existentialism”; he has had significant influence not only on theistic existentialists (e.g., Buber, Marcel, Shestov, Berdyaev) and quasi-theistic existentialists (Jaspers), but also their atheistic counterparts (Kafka, Camus, Sartre, Heidegger). Kierkegaard has often been compared to that other notorious arch-existentialist, Friedrich Nietzsche (see, e.g., Kellenberger’s *Kierkegaard and Nietzsche: Faith and Eternal Acceptance*). Though closer to phenomenology than to existentialism, Emmanuel Lévinas is another important philosophical reader of Kierkegaard (see *Kierkegaard and Levinas*, eds. Simmons and Wood; and Westphal’s *Levinas and Kierkegaard in Dialogue*).

2. Kierkegaard has been influential in psychology. See, for example, Kresten Nordentoft’s *Kierkegaard’s Psychology*, J. Preston Cole’s *The Problematic Self in Kierkegaard and Freud*, and existential psychotherapist Rollo May’s *The Meaning of Anxiety* and *The Discovery of Being*, ch. 5.

3. Postmodern theorists have been interested in Kierkegaard for his critique of rationalism, and for his practice of “indirect communication” (including but not limited to his use of multifarious pseudonyms throughout his authorship). Additionally, Jacques Derrida’s *The Gift of Death* and John Caputo’s *Against Ethics* both make creative use of Kierkegaard’s *Fear and Trembling*, and liberate it (for better or worse) from its religious *telos*.

4. Kierkegaard’s review of Hans Christian Andersen’s *Only a Fiddler*, in *From the of One Still Living*, presents us with his notion that an author must possess a “life-view,” which is “more than experience” but, rather, “the transubstantiation of experience,” an “unshakable certainty in oneself won from all experience, whether this has oriented itself only in all worldly relationships (a purely human standpoint, Stoicism, for example),” or “in its heavenward direction (the religious)” has “won the true Christian conviction” (*Early Polemical Writings*, p. 76). Kierkegaard criticizes Andersen for lacking a life-view and for his feeble portrayal of the “genius.” Kierkegaard, *contra* Andersen, maintains that a true genius is not crushed by circumstance, “is not a rush candle that goes out in a puff of air but a conflagration that the storm only incites” (ibid., p. 88). Later, in his unpublished *Book on Adler*, Kierkegaard contrasts the “premise-author,” who depends on the reading public for validation, with the “essential author,” for whom the earnest communication of a life-view is validation enough. (See also #9, below.)

5. Kierkegaard’s dissertation, *The Concept of Irony*, treats of ancient Socratic irony and modern German irony, irony in its “world-historical validity,” and irony in its ‘surgical’ function “in enabling personal life to gain health and truth” (p. 328).

6. Kierkegaard’s *Either/Or*, Bk. I, composed by an imaginary aesthete, contains a number of witty aphorisms comparable to Nietzsche’s aphoristic style (in “Diapsalmata”), an imaginary aesthete’s Mozart-eulogizing treatment of music’s immediacy (in “The Immediate Erotic Stages, or The Musical-Erotic”), a theory of seduction (in “The Seducer’s Diary”), and much else besides.

7. Though atheists will find Kierkegaard’s *The Concept of Anxiety* and *The Sickness Unto Death* fraught with theological undertones, they will also find therein insightful analyses of existential anxiety and despair. These concepts have been of interest to both philosophers and psychologists (see, e.g., #1, above, and the works of Rollo May in #2, respectively).

8. Philosophers of emotions have found in Kierkegaard a “classical moral psychologist.” See, for example, Robert C. Roberts’ “Existence, emotion, and virtue: Classical themes in Kierkegaard” (*The Cambridge Companion to Kierkegaard*, ch. 7), David Kangas’ “Kierkegaard” (*The Oxford Handbook of Religion and Emotion*, ch. 21), R. A. Furtak’s *Wisdom in Love: Kierkegaard and the Ancient Quest for Emotional Integrity* (esp. ch. 5), and Vincent A. McCarthy’s *The Phenomenology of Moods in Kierkegaard*.

9. Kierkegaard’s *Prefaces* constitutes satire on the “visible reading public” and its relation to an author, and on the misleading tendencies of book reviewers who mediate that relation. *The Corsair Affair* and the entries on journalism in vol. 2 of *Søren Kierkegaard’s Journals and Papers* are also relevant in this connection.

10. Kierkegaard’s pseudonym Johannes Climacus is primarily concerned with what it means to exist “Christianly-religiously,” but Climacus also discerns a more basic problem: “If people had forgotten what it means to exist religiously, they had probably also forgotten what it means to exist humanly; therefore this would have to be brought out” (*Concluding Unscientific Postscript*, p. 249). Consequently, much of *Postscript* is relevant to those who have little or no interest in Christianity or religion.

11. Throughout Kierkegaard’s authorship, but especially in *Two Ages: A Literary Review* (the section entitled “The Present Age”), one finds a prophetic critique of modernity’s impersonalizing trajectory, including the concept of “leveling.” For application of Kierkegaard’s thought to the Internet age, see the references I’ve listed in [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/kierkegaard/comments/169s2y/the_present_age_and_reddit/c803ii2).

12. Kierkegaard’s *Works of Love*, though largely based on the New Testament scriptures, is arguably the kind of humanizing religion that non-theists should want religious persons to practice (rather than the dehumanizing religion of, say, Westboro Baptist Church). See also atheist philosopher Simon Critchley’s sympathetic analysis in his article “[The Rigor of Love](http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/08/the-rigor-of-love/).”

13. Kierkegaard’s letters offer us a more intimate look at one man’s love of the written word. One of Kierkegaard’s principles of letter-writing is to keep the recipient free from any obligation to respond: “My letters,” he says, “have this negative characteristic: they do not require a reply” (*Letters and Documents*, Letter #61). Kierkegaard also treats letter-writing as akin to taking a walk with a friend or relative. Accordingly, here we find Kierkegaard at his most personal and, on occasion, his most avuncular.

14. Kierkegaard’s “Attack on Christendom” (see *The Moment and Late Writings*) presents atheists with a lively example of a religion’s rigorous self-critique. This should be the spirit of any worldview, sacred or secular. Just as Kierkegaard criticizes the State Church of which he was himself a faithful member, atheists can likewise learn to reprimand their fellows for instances of groupthink. Just as Kierkegaard attacks his and his father’s beloved pastor, Bishop Mynster, atheists should not be afraid to criticize popular atheist writers (including the self-styled “four horsemen” of the New Atheism).

15. Within the aforementioned “Attack,” many atheists will also find a welcome critique of religious (and specifically Christian) nationalism. Kierkegaard refers to “‘Christendom,’ a Christian state, a Christian country, a Christian world” as “an enormous illusion” (ibid., p. 157). On this theme, see Stephen Backhouse’s recent book, *Kierkegaard’s Critique of Christian Nationalism*, which begins and ends with Kierkegaard’s remark, “Every effort that tends toward the establishment of a Christian State, a Christian people, is *eo ipso* un-Christian, anti-Christian.”

Perhaps needless to say, the above suggestions are not exhaustive, and the above primary and secondary sources I have named only scratch the surface. Hopefully they give an indication of the enormous breadth of Kierkegaard’s influence while at least gesturing at the appreciable depth of his thought as well. In volumes 8–14 of the recent project, *Kierkegaard Research: Sources, Reception and Resources* (editor-in-chief, Jon Stewart), one can trace further Kierkegaardian influences on existentialism, theology, philosophy, art, poetry, literature, literary criticism, the social sciences, and socio-political thought.

Let me also suggest that atheists need not attempt to extricate Kierkegaard’s philosophical import from his theological concerns. Even for those whose concerns are strictly secular, it remains worthwhile to understand Kierkegaard on his own terms, just as it is fruitful for the devout Christian to listen to and learn from atheists such as Feuerbach, Nietzsche, and Camus without attempting to “Christianize” them.

I conclude with an excerpt from atheist Julian Baggini’s [recent article](http://www.aeonmagazine.com/world-views/julian-baggini-i-love-kierkegaard/) on the Dane: “Kierkegaard was the master of irony and paradox before both became debased by careless overuse. He was an existentialist a century before Jean-Paul Sart[r]e, more rigorously post-modern than postmodernism, and a theist whose attacks on religion bit far deeper than many of those of today’s new atheists. Kierkegaard is not so much a thinker for our time but a timeless thinker, whose work is pertinent for all ages yet destined to be fully attuned to none.”",,False,,t5_2qh5b,False,,,True,t3_1ecrsu,http://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/1ecrsu/what_can_atheists_get_out_of_reading_kierkegaard/,

I didn't really think much of it back then. I saw it as an incredibly artistic indie film with no substantial meaning to it. However, over the past couple years, I've spent a lot of my time reading, discussing and just thinking about philosophy. 

I recently watched the film this weekend with my brother, who I discuss philosophy the most with. After watching the film again, I was blown away at how much philosophy was in the film and how accurate it was to the study of philosophy in general. I checked the wikipedia and was disappointed to find that they for the most part disregarded this aspect to the film. It is very important to at least know this analysis if you want any chance at actually understanding this film without a strong background in philosophy.

Each of the characters represent a different philosophical concept. As the story progresses, the events and even the dialog represent how each concept would respond to other concepts. 

Characters with corresponding philosophical idea

1. Albert (Jason Swartzman) - The **self**. The subject that is going through an existential crisis. Ultimately, his character arks from a superficial existence, to a nihilistic existence, and finally to self-actualization(or authenticity). 

2. Catherine (Isabelle Huppert) - **Nihilism**. She is the ultimate enemy in the film. As an existential self, he must overcome this powerful idea in order to derive meaning in life.

3. Bernard (Dustin Hoffman) and Vivian (Lily Tomlin) - While both represent two very different ideas, they deserve to be put together. Bernard takes the holistic metaphysical perspective. He is the 'a priori knowledge'. He asks the most basic philosophical questions, like **ontology**(existence itself). He's always focused on the blanket, the big idea and tries to understand the details of his life in the context of the blanket. He understands the 'parts' *through* the 'whole'. Vivian takes the reductionist metaphysical perspective. She is the 'a posteriori knowledge'. She represents science and **epistemology**. Notice she only observes the experience itself and takes notes. She tries to understand the blanket by building up the details themselves. She understands the whole through adding the parts. While Bernard and Vivian may appear to fight and be disjointed at times, they are actually happily married. Neither one is more powerful than the other and neither one tells the other one that they are wrong. 

4. Brad (Jude Law) - He represents corporate America and **superficial everyday life** in general.  Brad does not understand the deep questions of life, but only accepts the answers that are on the surface. For instance, Brad himself is not interesting. He makes himself appear interesting by repeatedly telling the same Shania Twain story over and over again. He tries to understand philosophy at times, but sees philosophy as a means to end and not an end in itself. This is why his pursuit of philosophy ends in failure. He ends up having a miserable life.

5. Tommy (Mark Wahlberg) - He represents the man who only accepts half of philosophy, **reductionism**. He only believes Vivian's philosophy, and only emphasizes how everything is broken up (the parts). This can also be called scientism (It *only* takes science as a credible authority to knowledge). Tommy leads  Albert to Catherine (nihilism) because he fails to recognize the universe as a whole thing. When he finally meets Dawn (holism, explained below), he and Albert (self) can achieve self-actualization. Tommy is also constantly referred to as Albert's other in the film. ['Other'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Other#The_idea_of_the_Other) is a continental philosophical concept that the 'self' (Albert) uses to define itself. Without Tommy (the 'other'), Albert has nothing to base his 'self' on, which he needs to know to self-actualize and become authentic.

6. Dawn (Naomi Watts) - She is the foil character to Tommy (reductionism). She only accepts the opposite half of philosophy from Tommy, which is **holism**. She only knows the 'a priori' knowledge of Bernard (the blanket). She no longer recognizes the 'parts' and everyday superficial observations. In the beginning, she is with Brad (superficial everyday life) and only cares about the appearance and surfaces, just like Brad. However, when she discovers philosophy, she retreats from the world and becomes incapable of living in it properly. This isn't the appropriate response to philosophy either, but she is still a crucial component to understanding philosophy. Even though she looks crazy to the real world, she just has a completely different understanding of the world that the everyday superficial world (Brad) needs to recognize, but inevitably fails. When she gets with her foil character, Mark, the 'self' (Albert) becomes authentic. 

7. The African - He represents **coincidence** and how the self (Albert) tries to use coincidences/accidents to define their existence. He ultimately is not meaningful, but strays the self from the path to authenticity. Ultimately, the coincidences lead the 'self' to Christianity. While I don't necessarily think he portrayed the Christians in a poor light (They took a Sudanese refugee into their home after all), the director certainly portrayed them as being hypocritical when they are faced with Tommy (science, reductionism).

Our knowledge as humans is only so much, and I'd argue that an omnipotent being such as God would necessarily have to operate out of our knowledge of science and logic to exist.

Quoted from article: Today protests sweeping across countries as diverse as Turkey and Brazil serve as another reminder of the power, and at times, obligation, of ""the people"" to take to the streets in order to force their governments take their core needs and concerns into consideration as part of the normal practice of governance.

Obligation is a very powerful word (think Kant, Hegel, Kierkegaard with their vastly different positions). 

When is America's tipping point? Is this our moral imperative? 

My position: Absolutely without a doubt.

Atheism is a form of philosophy, one which holds a great deal of force and metaphysical implications. It is a very popular philosophy--there are more than **FIVE** times more subscribers to r/atheism than to r/philosophy--and has its own canonical figures. I haven't read a word of Christopher Hitchens or Richard Dawkins, which seems strange considering their relatively more popular role than Immanuel Kant or Ludwig Wittgenstein (who both had intriguing claims on our thoughts pertaining to the possible existence of God.) For such an important--and challenging--metaphysical stance, I think it would be in everybody's best interests to initiate some kind of dialogue with each other. 

I've read many a thread in r/atheism, and find there's a very vocal minority of people who dismiss theists or agnostics as inherently irrational, ignorant, and idiotic people. I don't agree with that. It seems like that such an unfounded statement is the result of poor dialogue between these atheists and intelligent non-atheists. Philosophical debate, if anything, can rectify that divide.   

Its obviously within our subreddit's scope to debate with Atheists. Their thumbnail comes from Bertrand Russel's teapot analogy, an obviously famous person in our field. Also, I'm sure many of the subscribers to r/philosophy also proudly identify themselves as 'godless redditors.' 

I'm thinking sometime this weekend (Sunday, perhaps?) interested members of r/philosophy could host a ~~debate~~ workshop with r/atheism. The ~~debate~~ workshop would be in the form of an r/atheist thread. Any of us could debate in favor of atheism or in favor of other philosophies. The point would be to challenge all views here. 

Hopefully, if this comes to fruition, a substantial amount, intrigued by provoking arguments, could engage in what I think is an awesome subreddit here. This would widen our discourse considerably. 

Any thoughts on this?  

**EDIT:** I didn't intend this to become just another pro/anti belief shitstorm. The scope of this thread does **not** include arguments for/against the existence of a 'higher' being. This is meant to be a preparatory discussion so that future dialogue, if possible, will contain rigorous philosophical reasoning. 


The scope of this thread does includes topics like:

* Should we discuss topics pertaining to the existence of god? 

* Is it possible to have a meaningful, unstructured debate?

* Should we include rules? If so, what should they be?

* How should we word the OP?

* What should the topics of discussion be? (apparently ontological arguments are dicey) 

* Various logistical possibilities

During the interview, the individual was asked about their views on gay marriage. 

""Thankyou for coming out tonight.  Let's get straight into tonight's discussion - are you for or against gay marriage?""

The man takes some time before eventually replying ""I'd have to say I am for gay marriage.""  The audience cheers in approval.  The man stares cynically into the audience, many of whom are wearing pro-gay clothing and wristbands.  The man stands up solemnly and signals that the crowd should cease their praise.  The man stares kindly at the audience. 

""I'd like to ask everyone in the audience to raise their hands if they support gay marriage.""

A sea of hands rise in the audience, illustrating that the majority of the crowd are in favour of introducing gay marriage.  The man appeared pleased by the reaction of the audience. 

""Please keep your hand raised if the reason you support gay marriage is that two individuals should be allowed the right to marry, regardless of sex, provided that they are of age and are genuinely in love.""

No hands were lowered, however a few members of the crowd begin to nod their heads in approval.  The man, still visibly pleased, proceeded to ask a third question. 

""Please keep your hand raised if you support incestuous relations and believe that two partners of the same family should be allowed the right to marry.""

The crowd appeared disgusted by the question and lowered their hands almost simultaneously. Not a single hand remained raised in the crowd.  The main slowly walked toward the audience until he stopped at the first row of seats.  He placed a microphone in a young woman's hand. 

""Would you please tell the audience why you oppose incest, ma'am?"" 

The woman frowned, but appeared determined to answer the question.

""It's simply disgusting! More importantly, it stagnates the gene pool. How could anybody in their right mind support something like that?"" 

The audience began to applaud in approval, but the host of the program remained dead silent.  A confident smirk emerged on the man's face. 

""You raise a good point.  Let me then remove the variable which is justifing your opinion and refine my question.  Could the audience please raise their hand if they support incestuous relations and marriage between two brothers, two sisters, a father and a son or a mother and a daughter provided, of course, that the couple is genuinely in love.""

No one in the audience rose their hand.  The man turned back to the woman.  He then asked the woman again why she did not support incestuous marriage, given the new conditions.  The woman appeared frustrated and annoyed by the mans constant questioning. 

""Because it's just wrong!  You can't compare the love held between a gay couple to that of an incest couple!"" 

The man looked down at the woman. 

""Why not?"" 

The woman began to cry.  As if on cue, the man slowly walked back to the stage.  The room was quiet, the tense silence only interrupted by the heavy footsteps of the man.  After sometime, the man returned to stage.  He tapped his microphone gently before speaking. 

""I'll tell you why it's wrong.  It's wrong because society wants us to think it's wrong.  We live in a time and a country where it's okay to support gay marriage and not be judged by your decision.  In fact, you'd probably be judged more if you didn't support gay marriage.  You would be labelled as ignorant and intolerant by many, including the majority of this room.  The problem with this is that society still thinks it's wrong to believe something.  No one in this room chose to show their support for incest, just as fifty years ago no one would have shown their support for gay marriage.  You justify your disapproval by saying that incestuous marriage will stagnate the gene pool.  However, when the question is modified to no longer include this means of justification you still think it's wrong and you have no idea why.  The reason why, ladies and gentlemen, is that our opinions aren't dictated by our own morality.  Our opinions are dictated by the conventional norms of society.  The masses don't want you to support incestuous marriage - and you don't.  You can think of no other reason why other than it being 'wrong' and 'gross', but none the less you still don't support it.""

The audience remained silent. 

""The truth is, we let other impact our opinions much more than we realise.  We lost our free speech a long time ago, and no one realised."" 

The man exited the stage and walked out of the building.  The audience remained silent.

Free from obligation, free to be whoever you want to be. When there is no goal, you have the ability to create whatever life you want.

Try to please God, try to please other people, try to please yourself. It doesn't matter, as long as you are fulfilled and happy, and have lead a life which sits well with your moral convictions. 

Today I realized that there is nothing coming to me, there is no plan for me: life is a sandbox. I can do whatever I want, be who ever I want to be, live however I want to. There might be consequences to some actions, but to live within the system and realize that the system is nothing but a guise for the few to rule over the many, you gain a strength that most people lack. You gain the ability to say ""Fuck That"" and move on with your life. 

Today may be a sad day, but tomorrow isn't even a day yet. What happens in the future, what has happened in the past, every last bit of it is because of me and my decisions. I have to take responsibility for my actions and responsibility for my own future. 

No man in the clouds is going to make things better. There is a power that can guide my life, that can make decisions for me. That is the power of thought. Through my own moral values, my own philosophical ideals, my own desires I can achieve a level of fulfillment that most men can't bring themselves to understand. 

There is a void below me, and the first step is the hardest to take. Today I took that step, tonight I fall into the void, tomorrow I hit the bottom. Tomorrow I decide what lies below, I decide what comes next.

And so, in deciding to having sex, these women have in effect *voluntarily waived their right to get an abortion*.

Now, I find this pro-life claim utterly baffling: consent to sex is *clearly* different from consenting to anything further, many women deliberately use birth control to *avoid* pregnancy, many women plan on getting an abortion if they should end up pregnant, etc. According to this pro-life claim, it seems, we are supposed to interpret the act of consensual sex itself as involving some sort of mysterious *tacit consent* and *occult commitments* that are not only morally significant, but so overwhelmingly morally important as to *completely override the actual preferences of the woman*. I don't think actions carry occult commitments, and this all seems like superstition to me.

But here's my question. Let's suppose for the sake of argument that actions *do* carry occult commitments. Even granting this, we still need a way of telling what those commitments are. Without a method of interpretation, we're utterly in the dark. For example, a typical pro-lifer might say that the act of consensual sex carries the commitment to bear the child, waiving one's right to an abortion. But a more radical pro-lifer might say that the act of consensual sex carries the commitment to bear *and raise* the child, waiving one's right to an abortion as well as one's right to put the child up for adoption. My question is: how are we supposed to tell which interpretation is correct, and which occult commitments are (and are not) carried by the act of consensual sex?

""It would have been very comforting indeed to believe that Eichmann was a monster . . . The trouble with Eichmann was precisely that so many were like him, and that the many were neither perverted nor sadistic, that they were, and still are terribly and terrifyingly normal.""

Hannah Arendt, Eichmann In Jerusalem: A Report on the Banality of Evil

Unless you've been living under a rock (cue Geico) you've probably heard the infectious single by Foster the People called ""Pumped Up Kicks"" on the radio this past year.

What you may or may not have noticed, though, is that that sunny 60's-soul-soaked song is really about an alienated, psychotic teen fantasizing about (or even considering) shooting and killing his classmates at school.

I've been wanting to tackle this song for a while now - but it was only after watching Terrence Malick's first film Badlands last week that something clicked. 

Here's why.

In an interview he gave last summer, Mark Foster of Foster the People explained the song this way: 

""The song is about a teenage kid that is trapped, isolated, and basically hates his life. So he's pretty much fantasizing going on a killing spree...More kids are getting guns, and shooting people, and these things are happening younger and younger, 14 or 13 years old. It's turning into an epidemic for American youth. I wanted to infiltrate, and dig beneath the surface and get into the psychology of what's going on in a kid's mind like that.""

On the band's Wikipedia, we also learn that:

""The issue of youth violence is a matter close to the group. Foster was bullied in high school, while bassist Cubbie Fink has a cousin who survived the Columbine High School massacre... Foster believes many have misinterpreted the song's meaning, and he has written letters to his record label and called radio stations to complain. He explained, 'The song is not about condoning violence at all. It's the complete opposite.'""

Foster makes some important points - while the tragedies of Columbine and Virginia Tech probably stand out as two of the most tragic, there has been an alarming increase in shooting incidents at schools in recent years. It's important that artists tackle the issue by drawing our attention to the hearts and souls of those alienated, bullied, and lost youth who feel like violence is their only option.

Admittedly, though, this subject has been tackled quite a bit, especially in music. Pre-Columbine, Pearl Jam was tapping into the psychology of just such a young person with the song and video ""Jeremy""; post-Columbine, goth-rock group Korn's single ""Thoughtless"" is about ""a bullied teenager who dreams of killing his tormentors,"" and POD's ""Youth of the Nation"" describes a school shooting in the first verse.

But all of these songs predictably reflect their subject matter - the music itself is dark, violent, and disorienting. It's what we'd expect an alienated, angry youth's thoughts to ""sound' like, and allows us to distance ourselves from them, even though we remain empathetic.
What makes ""Pumped Up Kicks"" unique is the juxtaposition of the dark, violent content with its blasé, even charming sound. We're swept up into the song, expecting lyrics about summer love or beach parties - when suddenly, those strange phrases whiz by us like bullets: ""you better run, better run, outrun my gun.""

The lyrics are particularly horrifying because of their context - the song is not insanely angry nor insanely happy. There's not anything there to signify the insane or even dangerous - its exterior is casual, smooth, and easy-going.

Foster the People's snappy groove flouts our tidy expectations, thereby forcing us to step into the singer's world before we even know what's happened. As one blogger writes, "" I was so engrossed with the cheery melody of its chorus that it took me a few listens to discover that the lyrics suggest dark, Columbine revenge.""

This was also my experience of the song - and after watching Badlands for the first time, I realized that it would have been a good fit for the original soundtrack.

First, there is a literal connection: Malick's first film is also about a cigarette-smoking wanna-be cowboy (""Kit"") who decides one day, with an air of aloof indifference, to start killing. Kit lures his young girlfriend Holly into his senseless crime spree, which plays out against a very Midwestern background that reflects Kit's attitude (one reviewer called the scenery ""breathtaking both in its sweep and in its banality"").
The characters of Kit and Holly are alienated from the world, and deeply self-involved - especially Kit, who seems to only understand himself as the star of a James Dean movie. In the words of actor Martin Sheen: ""These kids, both Kit and Holly, had an image of themselves that was way out of the realm of reality.""

But even though they're deluded and dangerous, they still come across as somewhat sweet, simple, and even bored with themselves and their actions - and the effect is terrifying.

As one reviewer wrote: ""Sheen conveys Kit's craziness so effectively because he does not ever act the madman."" They shrug, smoke, and mutter across the plains - all the while feeling, as Holly puts it, ""kind of blah, like a bathtub after the water has all gone down the drain."" They are - like the singer in ""Pumped Up Kicks"" - all too casual.

Badlands, then, makes an artistic move similar to ""Pumped Up Kicks."" Rather than playing off of our expectations of ""the bad guy"" and allowing us to distance ourselves, the film makes us cozy up to the unexceptional, even charming exterior that harbors evil, in order to really see it and understand its ""banality.""

The ""banality of evil"" is a phrase coined by Hannah Arendt during the trail of Nazi Adolf Eichmann, and was applied in a stricter sense to matters of work and duty to the state. But the idea is this: evil is ""terribly and terrifyingly normal."" It is often the work of ordinary people that are just doing, as they see it, what has to get done to advance themselves or even just to ""get from point A to point B.""

Although evil is banal, Arendt thought that one couldn't do it without a measure of thoughtlessness and remoteness from reality. She writes:

""It was sheer thoughtlessness—something by no means identical with stupidity—that predisposed him to become one of the greatest criminals of that period...such remoteness from reality and such thoughtlessness can wreak more havoc than all the evil instincts taken together...""

This notion reflects a Thomistic idea of evil, with its roots in St. Augustine: evil is not a ""thing"" or a ""being,"" but a privatio boni, or ""lack of good."" Good can exist without evil - but evil can't exist without good. Evil is a parasite of the good, with no real essence.

Of course, none of this means that we identify or even empathize with the violence of either the song or the movie - no more than Arendt identified with Eichmann.

But maybe it means that we are forced to confront their humanity, and in doing so, better understand our own casual inclinations toward evil, and evil itself. This is not a comfortable process - it's also a hard thing to convey properly in art without coming across as ""glorifying"" or ""making light of"" evil.

I understand most people will probably have some reservations about getting excited about a song that, at the end of the day, is a happy song about a teenager fantasizing about killing people. It's hard to get around that. Won't most young people miss the nuanced message?

But, in my experience, I feel Godwin's law has gone too far in a number of instances.  And so, my defense of Nazi comparisons:

1.  Analogies do not compare the content of the things, but rather the structure of the argument.  This is why when you see ""Cat : Kitten  ::  Dog : Puppy"" you don't hear people say ""That's retarded, you can't compare cats to dogs like that, they're totally different!""  It is simply a comparison of one theme (in this case, the name of baby animals of a species versus fully developed ones.)  What other factors they may differ are on that are not related to this one central theme are irrelevant.

2.  Similarly, if someone said that loggers should not be blamed for supporting an immoral system because they need a job, and someone replied that so did the camp guards at Auschwitz, the presenter of this analogy should not be faulted or criticized for invoking the Nazis.  He is not comparing the loggers to the Nazis - he is merely presenting a counter-example to the idea that ""Needing a job justifies otherwise immoral action.""  He is in no way saying the logger is like a camp guard, but is instead testing this one idea in the most extreme circumstance possible.  Given the revulsion most would feel at saying that being a camp guard is morally justified by the need for a job, the defender of loggers should either a) retract the original statement in its entirety, b) amend it (such as adding ""except in the case of directly harming other humans""), or c) contest that the comparison does not hold in some critical manner.  But, to wave it off for its invocation of the Nazis is fallacious at best.

3.  This is not a defense of ""The Nazis wore pants"" type arguments.  For example, imagine a person advocated a law to require all death-row inmates to receive a tattoo on their arm to mark them as such and ease recapture should they escape.  Were someone to respond with the all too familiar ""You know who else forced people in holding centers to get tattoos!?"" then an accusation of making ""the Nazis wore pants"" type argument would apply.  This is distinct from what I am defending, because this type of argument has broader implications than just that the single idea presented is wrong or misguided.  Rather, it is making sweeping statements about the person's mindset and the motives for their idea.


4.  The Nazis are a uniquely good group for these comparisons precisely because of their radical nature.  Given much of their overlap with other aspects and norms of Western civilization, they provide a means to test many of our general ideas when taken to their absolute extreme.",,False,,t5_2qh5b,False,,,True,t3_i08ie,http://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/i08ie/a_defense_of_nazi_comparisons/,
1375735598.0,201,self.philosophy,1jrjb1,Do invasions of privacy matter? Are they wrong if they don't impact your life? What about the NSA's actions?,266,65,97,http://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/1jrjb1/do_invasions_of_privacy_matter_are_they_wrong_if/,"I'm an undergraduate philosophy student and I recently read an article ""Coercion and Authority"" by Arthur Ripstein. He makes a distinction between Mill's value system and Kant's value system. According to Mill, an action is wrong if it sets your interests back in terms of pleasure or pain. According to Kant, an action is wrong if it limits your freedom - if it interferes in any way with your capacity to use the means at your disposal to set and pursue your own ends independently (which means, you have the right to exclude others from using your property because their using it limits your ability to use it as you choose).

My professor used an example of tying a balloon to someone's toe to illustrate the difference. Imagine your roommate ties a balloon to your toe while you're sleeping, but unties it before you wake up. You never know he tied it to your toe and it never affects your life in anyway. According to Mill, this action would not be wrong because it has not affected your interests in any way, i.e. it has not harmed you. However, according to Kant, this action would be wrong because your roommate has interfered with your capacity to choose how you use your means, i.e. your body, for your own purposes. 

Now, let's apply this to the actions of the NSA. If their invasions of your privacy, i.e. recording your phone calls and emails and possibly reading through them, do not impact your interests in any way then according to Mill they are not wrong. However, I've read that knowing someone might be watching you stifles creativity because you're not willing to try as many things (I forgot the exact argument, but that was the gist of it). If this is true, then I think we can say the NSA's actions are wrong according to Mill because an atmosphere of surveillance stifles your ability to act creatively. Furthermore, I think we can also say the NSA's actions are wrong according to Kant because the NSA is interfering with your capacity to use your property independently of anyone else and thereby limits your freedom. 

Does anyone else have any thoughts about this? Or any other value systems that could be applied to the NSA's actions?",,False,,t5_2qh5b,False,,,True,t3_1jrjb1,http://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/1jrjb1/do_invasions_of_privacy_matter_are_they_wrong_if/,

Hi, very-pleased-to-meet-you and all that. But I digress; the reason I'm making this thread is not to introduce ourselves. It seems that we've inherited a bit of a *problem*, and it's a problem that could use some open discussion before we decide on one solution or another.

To put it bluntly, and simply; what direction do we want this sub-reddit to go in? What direction do *you*, our userbase, want this sub-reddit to go in? Right now our content is a mix of questions, discussions, and posts that are slightly... lighter in nature, such as [this one.](http://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/mqxyq/nothing/) And that last category seems to be the most problematic, so let's focus the discussion on them for the moment.

I'm in favour of banning links to text-only images - if you want to quote something, you can do it in a self post. That'll be slightly more likely to foster discussion, will reduce (the admittedly minimal) karma whoring, and hopefully encourage submitters to actually explain a bit about why they're posting a quote. 

I also think that the meme-like submissions which frequently garner huge number of upvotes should be disallowed; they're frequently only barely related to philosophy, and don't generally produce any constructive responses. In my opinion, the only value lost in banning them would be a few karma points.

*However*, I understand this is a divisive issue amongst the users here. It's pretty clear from [previous](http://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/m0fum/of_the_top_100_posts_to_rphilosophy/) [threads](http://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/m5eux/open_request_for_rphilosophy_mods/) that there's a lot of unhappiness, both about the current state of r/philosophy and pretty much any possible future direction - so I want to see what you have to say about this, and about any other possible actions the moderators could make to change or improve this sub-reddit. Maybe you think we should leave it well enough alone, and just stick to approving things caught in the spam filter. *If so, say so.*

It would be nice to have a deductive argument that p from self-evident premises. Unfortunately I am unable to provide one. So I will have to rest content with the following intuitive considerations in its support: p.

---
**Katz**: I have seventeen arguments for p, and I know of only four for not-p. Therefore, p.

---
**Lewis**: Most people find the claim that not-p completely obvious and when I assert p they give me an incredulous stare. But the fact that they find not-p obvious is no argument that it is true, and I do not know how to refute an incredulous stare. Therefore, p.

---
**Fodor**:
My argument for p is based on three premises:

        1. q
        2. r
        and
        3. p

From these, p deductively follows. Some people may find the third premise controversial, but it is clear that if we replaced that premise by any other reasonable premise, the argument would go through just as well.

---
**Goldman**: Several critics have put forward purported ""counterexamples"" to my thesis that p; but all of these critics have understood my thesis in a way that was clearly *not intended*, since I intended my thesis to have no counterexamples. Therefore p.

-----
**Jackson**: The folk think that not-p. But I just called them ""the folk"". Therefore, p.

---
**Plato**:

&gt;SOCRATES: Is it not true that p?

&gt;GLAUCON: I agree.

&gt;CEPHALUS: It would seem so.

&gt;POLEMARCHUS: Necessarily.

&gt;THRASYMACHUS: Yes, Socrates.

&gt;ALCIBIADES: Certainly, Socrates.

&gt;PAUSANIAS: Quite so, if we are to be consistent.

&gt;ARISTOPHANES: Assuredly.

&gt;ERYXIMACHUS: The argument certainly points that way.

&gt;PHAEDO: By all means.

&gt;PHAEDRUS: What you say is true, Socrates.

---
**Strawson**: Only philosophers would think that not-p. Therefore, p.

EDIT: So... These are supposed to be *proofs* that p.  Here are some of yours:

&gt; Chomsky: Western governments use p as a tool to maintain control of the natural resources of foreign nations.

&gt; Plantinga: P is properly basic.

&gt; Schopenhauer: Almost all of our sorrows spring out of our relations with p.

1297772670.0,199,self.philosophy,flscf,All philosophers should take calculus.,319,120,237,http://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/flscf/all_philosophers_should_take_calculus/,"tl;dr 
If you've made it to my post, you're probably prepared to downvote me to the bottom of the internet because i'm probably going to present some ridiculous unjustifiable argument in favor of a seemingly unjustifiable claim.  However, I hope that I can change your mind.

Philosophy developed as a love of wisdom and that usually meant wisdom in two distinct areas: the public, outer, world, and the private, inner world.  Since the enlightenment and the scientific revolution, it became increasingly difficult to say anything meaningful at all about the natural world without some sort of natural science background.  I think that's a fair claim.  Philosophical questions simply became either eliminated from the conversation altogether, because they were no longer relevant (""would God put the sun or the earth at the center of the universe?""), or they became scientific questions (""what is the nature of matter?"")

It turns out that now, the same is happening to the philosophy of the inner subjective world.  With the advent of neuroscience and psychology, we now have, to some extent, an objective, third person view of first person phenomena that were for millenia off limits to scientific inquiry.  This is a new development and means some important things for philosophy.  Again, much like the natural world, questions become either eliminated from the conversation altogether because they are no longer relevant (""what is the nature of the soul?"") or become scientific questions (""what is the nature of pain or pleasure?"")  Now, what does this mean for philosophy?

My answer is not that philosophy is dying, but that it does now and will continue to in the future, require a larger understanding of what we already *know* about the universe and its inhabitants (i.e., science), in order to discover the best approach for learning what we do *not* know and are limited in our ability to understand given our current technological limitations.  

For this reason, I suggest that anyone who is interested in learning about the external world should be at the very least *competent* in what we already know about the universe and should be able to give a rational account of it *before* attempting to make any theoretical assumptions or postulates about what we do not know.  In other words, if you want to study the philosophy of time, for example, you shouldn't first be turning to Taoist texts, but to Newton and Einstein.  If you want to study the philosophy of the mind or consciousness, you should at least be remotely competent in basic neuroscience and biology before you attempt to press onward.

Again, I'm not saying that philosophy should be or is being replaced by science; I don't think it ever will be based on how much the scientific community learns that we *don't know* every day.  However, the philosophers at the forefront of the conversations about some of the tougher of life's mysteries seem to have a very strong grasp of the science behind it, and are, in a sense, blurring the line between science and philosophy in a unique way.

Can someone help me work out this ideology?,267,68,378,http://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/umyz3/ive_reasoned_my_way_into_a_fascist_mindset_can/,"I'm stuck, and would love to hear responses on this line of thought that's been bothering me. Follow me for a moment:

As a society, we have a system of checks and balances to ensure the safety of the public. One of the ways we ensure the safety of the public is to set a bar of quality to certain professions and activities.

For instance, if you want to be a doctor, you have to earn a medical license. This is because a person practicing medicine has the potential to do great harm to a person if they are not properly trained. This is true for lawyers as well, who have to pass the Bar exam.

As well, certain checks are set for activities: in order to drive, you need a license. These licenses are not only given to the best drivers; the exam is put in place to make sure the worst drivers don't drive. This is because drivers have a potential to cause great damage to others.

Now, I'm getting close to ideas that are bothering me:

If people have to take exams and tests in order to work in professions and engage in activities that can harm people's lives if done improperly... why are there no tests to stop incompetent people from having children and voting?

Voting has the potential to radically alter a person's life, and in some cases can lead to measures that could destroy livelihoods or place people in risk. Therefor, there should be a test to ensure 'bad' voters don't vote...? What metric is used or who decides and implements it isn't the issue- its whether it should exist or not.

And having kids just seems crazy now: anyone can have a kid, but not everyone can adopt a kid? Why is there a rigorous exam for people who want to adopt a child to ensure its safety and wellbeing, yet anyone can have a child?

...But I recognize what these thoughts are: they're fascist, and infringe on basic human freedoms...

I'm not trying to convince people to think this way; I'm honestly uncomfortable holding these positions. I'd love to hear what you guys think of this.

&gt;Centuries later, the philosopher Thomas Hobbes introduced a further puzzle, wondering: what would happen if the original planks were gathered up after they were replaced, and used to build a second ship.[3] Which ship, if either, is the original Ship of Theseus?

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus#Variations_of_the_paradox

Now, in Futurama S7E7, a similar incident is portrayed. Hermes Conrad begins 'upgrading' his body with robotic replacements to remain competitive at his job. Ultimately, he replaces the final component, his brain, with that of the recently executed killer robot, Roberto, resurrecting the maniac in a new robot-body. 

However, Zoidberg had been collecting the disposed flesh-parts of Hermes to build a ventriloquist dummy from his old friend. And when he reattached the brain, voilla, same old human Hermes (only now with stitches and slightly rotted).

When I saw this, I immediately thought of the Oscar Wilde quote, “The nicest feeling in the world is to do a good deed anonymously - and have somebody find out.” 

But it also made me consider whether recounting a story about an anonymous act of kindess diminishes (retroactively, I suppose) its virtue or moral weight. Presumably, the initial act was done without any expectation of benefit, beyond appreciating 'having done a good thing' within oneself. Does recounting it – and perhaps receiving social accolade – reduce the degree of selflessness, and therefore the virtue of the act? Or, am I simply confusing myself, assuming that selflessness  imparts a higher degree of virtue to an act? (E.g. If ones saves a baby for selfless reasons or selfish ones, the baby is still saved, right? So why does it matter?)

Furthermore, does the context of anonymity – as with Reddit – matter at all?

The only philosophical/theological tradition I know of in this vein (NB: I'm not well versed in philosophy) is Calvinism, which presumed that one could not truly commit virtuous acts because one was always thinking/aware of the future reward. (I.e. The only path to heaven was through grace, and I recall there being a predestination aspect there too.) Rephrasing that, an act from which there is a reward extracted is not virtuous.

Are there any classic arguments around this issue, and how do people think they apply in a case like this?

I wrote a piece analyzing gender expression through the lens of Jacques Derrida's ""Differance"" and Judith Butler's theories on the performativity of gender. I was pleased with it when I finished, and couldn't help wondering what she might think of it. So I sent it to her. I had no idea whether she'd respond or not. If she did, I figured it'd be quick. 

I was thrilled to receive a fully thought-out (and funny!) reply from her that same day! I'll paste the article and part of our exchange below.

Thanks, Judith. You rock. :)

Response from Butler:

Well, Drew, you are certainly not a misguided ass, but a thoughtful essayist who has something very important to say. You don't need me to tell you that.  The part of my work you draw on does suggest that gender works on us more than we work on it. But others have accused me of being too volitional, claiming that one can, in fact, subvert norms by performing gender differently.  The truth is, I think, that for me, we are acted on by cultural norms, but we also act within them.  Some of you folks can really take on a gender one day, and discard it the next, and that is fabulous. But some of us understand ourselves to be more stuck or fixed or positioned, as you like.  And there are trans people on both sides of that debate, as you know.  Derrida is the one who formulates performativity in Signature, Event, Context, and again in his short essays on Kafka - Before the Law, and even the Law of Genre.  So he is not against the performative, but thinks we have to take into account the role that repetition plays in its effectiveness.  One thing I remember well from a brief conversation with him is that he did not like be compared with Baudrillard, but it matters not.  In any case, I appreciate your honesty.  Whatever gender we are doing never quite captures everything we are and want.  Maybe that is another way of describing what you call ""alienation.""

1. Godel's incompleteness theorems.  I've encountered the correct use of these theorems once, in a meta-logic course where they were applied to the proper subject matter.  Godel's theorems get abused more than any other intellectual achievement I can think of, usually by people trying to sound intelligent but have no backing to their argument.  It's the most abused because it's the most misapplied.  I fail to remember any accurate usage of the theorems beyond the content it was meant to address, the Logicist program.

2. Appeal to the quantum.  Quantum physics is weird. It's inexplicably weird.  That doesn't mean it's an excuse for your batshit theory on consciousness or what have you.  I think people have become more aware of how futile it is to try to develop a positive explanation of some phenomena through the use of quantum lingo.  There will still be the occasional pseudo-intellectual or spiritual huckster like Deepak Chopra that will try and invoke the vocabulary of quantum physics for their own irrational ends, though, and people still fall for it.

3. The impossibility of negative proof.  You can prove a negative.  The relevant point in the God debate is more along the lines of Russell's teapot, which was trying to show that just because there is no evidence of the theory, doesn't confirm the theory in any way.  But you certainly can prove a negative in logic and mathematics.  Not to go against 1), but I think Godel's incompleteness theorem can be seen as a negative proof against Logicism.  And of course, any valid and sound modus tollens argument is proof of a negative.

The idea was that if you can't distil an argument in 1500 words or less, you lack the ability to be succinct and on-topic. The (unintended) result was that I would regularly spend in excess of 5 hours writing, editing, and cutting down 1000-1500 word essays, and I became a perfectionist about relatively small details which would improve argumentative structure - things like sentence construction, paragraph ordering, killing unnecessary digressions.

In any kind of professional writing, where I now hope to apply my skills - journalism, advertising, corporate copy-editing, even blogging - quantity is much more highly prized than being able to write the perfect sentence. You are expected to spit copy at an alarming rate, with little or no regard for self-editing (after all there are other people paid to do it). I was sadly unprepared for my first wave of j-school deadlines, since I would spend hours agonizing over relatively minor details in my articles, as I was used to in philosophy.

Believe it or not, Reddit has helped me overcome my perfectionism. Commenting on Reddit is so worthless on average (you can easily write hundreds of words and directly observe that no one has read or upvoted them) that if you have any desire to obtain karma, you have to start focusing on quantity. Observing my upvotes has pushed me towards an optimum where I can present an argument people will read and like in the minimum amount of time, and with minimal regard for the outcome. I am far less likely to rewrite a sentence five times when I can directly see how I am rewarded for the extra investment of time and effort.

So, thoughts? Anyone else have a similar experience?

Free Will: The ability to make choices unconstrained by certain factors. 


The factors are the key feature in the definition of free will. 

Can we choose a course of action which is impossible to achieve through physical constraints? I would not be hesitant to say yes, for often I have chose an action which I have later found to be beyond my capability due to 'natural' constraints. The insane may have no such concept of these constraints and will chose to do things that do not happen in reality. Ergo physical constraints are not involved within my argument. What about other constraints?

I would argue that social constraints can similarly be breached if and only if it's within their mental &amp; metaphysical constraints. That is to say the some people can and do chose things that society condemns and prohibits. 

What remains are metaphysical and mental constraints. My argument is that even if metaphysical or mental constraints limited a view of free will that is was useful as a construct for progress.


What do I mean when I say that free will is useful as a construct for progress? I mean that the notion of free will engenders actions of an agent with direct responsibility and this direct responsibility being an entry condition for mental constraints would cause an individual to act significantly different for the majority of cases. So to enable society to function and develop individual responsibility of actions and the free will to make the choices and bear the consequences that the choices hold should be a maintained shared illusion.

The accreditation of one's own deeds as a direct implication of your own choices is also, I would argue psychologically healthy in that it could promote betterment of oneself.

[EDIT: I only see a few answers to my actual question below. I'm regretting my facetious title now, because people just saw that and went straight to the comments section.

For example, I found [Ermoauro's](http://www.reddit.com/user/Ermoauro) answer fascinating. Anyone have a different take?]

Actually, my question isn׳t about the definition of love per se, though it'd be nice to hear you guys's opinions on the matter. 

My real question is about the importance of love in modern Western culture today. It seems to me that finding a love interest has taken center stage in my society (America) and that it affects people's arguments regarding public policy, as well as how the development of people's courtships are portrayed in movies. 

For example, it seems that people make the argument that we should not forbid the love of two homosexuals because of the preciousness of love.

I think that this is a bogus argument, because I do not see the preciousness of love. I understand the joy and elation that love causes in my brain, but I also understand that love does not always last and these chemical reactions of my brain are very fleeting. It seems as if people believe in the preciousness of love because they believe that if done well, that pleasure can last until death. But since when did preciousness become equated with the longevity and quality of pleasure? 

(By the way, the topic of homosexual equality is not under debate here. It is just an example of how we see love taking over in society.)

What I'm really asking is why we put such emphasis on the acquisition of an abstract quality such as that of love?",,False,,t5_2qh5b,True,,,True,t3_p3e67,http://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/p3e67/what_is_love/,

""After forty years of vegetarianism, Max Berger was about to sit down to a feast of pork sausages, crispy bacon and pan-fried chicken breast. Max had always missed the taste of meat, but his principles were stronger than his culinary cravings. But now he was able to eat meat with a clear conscience. 

The sausage and bacon had come from a pig called Priscilla he had met a week before. The pig had been genetically engineered to be able to speak and, more importantly, to want to be eaten. Ending up on a human's table was Priscilla's lifetime ambition and she woke up on the day of her slaughter with a keen sense of anticipation. She had told all this  to Max just before rushing off to a comfortable and humane slaughterhouse. Having heard her story, Max thought it would be disrespectful *not* to eat her.  

The chicken had come from a genetically modified bird which had been 'decerebrated'. In other word, it lived the life of a vegetable, with no awareness of self, environment, pain or pleasure. Killing it was therefore no more barbarous then uprooting a carrot. 

Yet as the plate was placed before him, Max felt a twinge of nausea. Was this just a reflex reaction, caused by a lifetime of vegetarianism? Or was it the physical sign of a justifiable psychic distress? Collecting himself, he picked up his knife and fork...

I find myself agreeing with these people in part, but not for superficial reasons. Plenty of games are beautiful experiences- *ICO* and *Shadow of the Colossus* come to mind- and many are pure entertainment, which can be claimed equally of movies, a ""legitimate"" form of art.

That said, what exactly is the role of a game? Aristotle's theory of art tells us that art is a matter of imitation; a game does just the *opposite*: rather than bring one into and teach lessons about the human experience, games strive to pull one *away* from what is human. A game has idiosyncratic physics, feel, rules, and objectives, often very much unlike the world we inhabit. Unlike books, paintings, or films, games have *input*, which means that the new rules and physics are felt *by* the player, creating greater immersion. 

This leads me to conclude that the ultimate realization of gaming, on an aesthetic level, is **escapism**. Perhaps not a groundbreaking argument, I nevertheless feel that a) in crafting unique locales with their own rules and objectives, and b) in attempting to draw in the player with fun, accessible game design, games are as much open doors to new worlds as they are closed doors to our own. 

It might also be worth reflecting on the *teleology* of games. It shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone that moral skepticism and relativism are as common as coffee in the modern West, and plenty of people feel existentially unsure of themselves or their place in the world. Games, by contrast, tend to have a fixed, simple objective which, when realized, bestows great satisfaction upon the player. And because games can be played and re-played, no goal is ever lost: any player can pop in another figurative quarter and try again. The fixed teleological quality of games is yet another incentive to escape from our morally ambiguous world and into the simplicity of virtual hubs. 

Which leads me to my last question: are games *good* for society? (I'm something of a gamer myself, for the record.) They can be social in some cases, bringing small groups of people together in a meaningful way; yet too much of it can become addictive and promote a kind of detachment from the difficulties of the cold, unimaginative real world. There's a reason gamers tend to be reclusive.

This article was posted on a friend's Facebook page, and after reading it, this was my response (I am extremely interested in what makes things morally right or morally wrong):


'What is it, exactly, that makes incest morally wrong? I'm always curious of people's opinions. If he wasn't underage and they never conceived...then that's weird, but whatever. Certainly not my cup of tea but I always wonder about people's opinions on the matter, and rarely get anything other than ""Cuz...you'd be related to them. Gross""
I don't tend to talk about it wit folks I know because having the opinion it's not morally wrong makes people assume you want to do it; similar to the line of thinking that supporting gay marriage means you want everyone to be gay.
In this case I'd say it's wrong because she's likely using her authority to coerce sex out of him, and that is not okay at all.'
Not the most articulate things I've ever typed, but possibly gets my point across.

Still no replies from anyone. I would really like to hear opinions/ theories on the matter.

If there’s one thing Friedrich Nietzsche did well, it’s obliterate feel-good beliefs people have about themselves. He has been criticized for being a misanthrope, a subvert, a cynic and a pessimist, but I think these assessments are off the mark. I believe he only wanted human beings to be more honest with themselves.

He did have a remarkable gift for aphorism — he once declared, “It is my ambition to say in ten sentences what others say in a whole book.” A hundred years after his death, Nietzsche retains his disturbing talent for turning a person’s worldview upside-down with one jarring remark.

Even today his words remain controversial. They hit nerves. Most of his views are completely at odds with the status quo.

Here are 40 unsympathetic statements from the man himself. Many you’ll agree with. Others you will resist, but these are the ones to pay the most attention to — your beliefs are being challenged. It’s either an opportunity to grow, or to insist that you already know better. If any of them hit a nerve in you, ask yourself why.

We'd like to run a reading group for Kant's famous *Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals*. This is Kant's first big work in ethics where he lays down the categorical imperative and the groundwork for his deontological ethics. If we did this reading group we'd probably read smallish chunks of the text each week, then post our thoughts about the weekly reading section in a thread set aside for each week's reading group discussion.

**Why do we want it?**

/r/philosophy users come from all sorts of philosophical backgrounds. Some of us are just picking up our first works of philosophy as we get here, while others of us teach philosophy at a university level, and many of us are somewhere in between. Still, whether old or new to philosophy, there's always something to take from Kant's *Groundwork*. As well, Kant is a controversial figure here on /r/philosophy and often someone attacked for his seemingly radical views. A reading group dedicated to his moral philosophy will be extremely beneficial to honing our discussions of Kant on /r/philosophy and maybe helping us to see that he's not quite so vicious as we might have thought.

**Who are we?**

The two of us most interested in running this reading group are /u/ADefiniteDescription and I. We are both graduate students in philosophy at Leiter-ranked schools in the US with interests in moral philosophy. Kant is ADD's favorite philosopher and I think he's pretty OK.

So how do we feel? Who here would be interested in participating in a reading group for Kant's *Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals*?",,False,,t5_2qh5b,False,,,True,t3_1e5l2b,http://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/1e5l2b/checking_for_interest_in_a_rphilosophy_reading/,moderator

Or is it a bunch of equally unhappy people trying to delude themselves into happiness? Is it something else entirely?

I've struggled with severe depression most of my life and lately a common bit of advice friends have been giving me (solicited or not) is that once I decide to be happy I will be. They don't mean it in the sense that ""Once you figure out what makes you happy, you must decide to work towards that."" which I've been trying with gradual success; they literally mean I just need to decide to be happy about *everything*.

For example: where I live one of the only redeeming features is a hot, sunny spring and summer. I've been extra bummed since this year since, so far, we have yet to go 3 consecutive days without rain and the temperature is easily 10C below normal. Can I 'decide' to be happy about the awful weather? Or my dead-end job? Or my student loan debt that keeps me locked in my dead-end job? I totally understand and accept that I need to make changes and move on, which I am doing, it's just going to take a little while. I just get tired of being told to smile or people otherwise getting up in my business.

TL;DR: I need a good, intelligent, counter-argument for the next time I'm given this advice. Unless they're right, maybe I can just decide to be happy...

Student: ""Uh...Sir..What does Crash Course in Logical Assumptions mean?""
Professor: ""Well, it involves taking information that you have, forming assumptions using logic, and then creating new information. Let me try to answer your question by asking you a question. Do you own a car?""
Student: ""Uh...Yes, I do.""

Professor: ""Well, then I can now logically assume that you drive.""

Professor: ""Then I can logically assume that you are heterosexual.""

Sanders, in her MA thesis “Discovering the Source of Gatsby’s Greatness: Nick’s Eulogy of a ‘Great’ Kierkegaardian Knight,” suggests that Fitzgerald’s Jay Gatsby is, from narrator Nick Carraway’s standpoint, a Kierkegaardian knight of faith. Although Sanders ignores Kierkegaard’s explicit statement that “in the pseudonymous books there is not a single word by me,”† and tends to conflate Kierkegaard’s ethical and religious categories, her analysis remains generally compelling.

My interest is not to disentangle her confusion of Kierkegaard’s categories, but to suggest a further possibility for understanding Jay Gatsby in a Kierkegaardian light. Sanders relies on *Either/Or* and *Fear and Trembling*, but overlooks *Concluding Unscientific Postscript*. In that work, Kierkegaard’s pseudonym Johannes Climacus presents us with a distinction between “Religiousness *A*” and “Religiousness *B*” and a rich, sustained analysis of each sphere. The first signifies a person’s recognition of their relation to an eternal happiness; the second signifies faith in the God-man, the “absolute paradox,” the Incarnate Christ. For Climacus, the first is presupposed to (but not to be confused with) the second.

Climacus describes Religiousness *A* in terms of “pathos,” and distinguishes it not only from mere intellectual belief but also from esthetic passion: “Esthetic pathos expresses itself in words and can in its truth signify that the individual abandons himself in order to lose himself in the idea, whereas existential pathos results from the transforming relation of the idea to the individual’s existence” (*Postscript*, Hongs’ trans., p. 387). True religious pathos “lies not in testifying to an eternal happiness but in transforming one’s own existence into a testimony to it” (ibid., p. 394). “The highest well-being of a happy immediacy, which jubilates joy over God and all existence, is very endearing but not upbuilding and essentially not any relationship with God” (ibid., p. 560, fn. 1). Moreover, in contrast to Religiousness *B*, wherein the relationship with God is sought in “something outside the individual,” *viz.*, in Christ, Religiousness *A* locates the God-relationship in “the individual himself” (ibid., p. 561), in the individual’s “inward deepening” (ibid., p. 556).

In Jay Gatsby, we find a man whose idea of himself is not mere “esthetic pathos,” but the sort of life-transforming “existential pathos” that Climacus describes:

&gt; The truth was that Jay Gatsby, of West Egg, Long Island, sprang from his Platonic conception of himself. He was a son of God—a phrase which, if it means anything, means just that—and he must be about His Father’s Business, the service of a vast, vulgar and meretricious beauty. So he invented just the sort of Jay Gatsby that a seventeen-year-old boy would be likely to invent, and to this conception he was faithful to the end. (*The Great Gatsby*, ch. 6)

Gatsby’s beauty is “meretricious” not merely because he is originally the poor James Gatz, but because his dream, his ultimate love and longing, despite his self-made outward appearance, is not to be sought in earthly riches. Gatsby transcends the esthetic life-view of his contemporaries (most notably that of Tom and Daisy). Instead, his dream is bound up in his love for Daisy:

&gt; His heart beat faster and faster as Daisy’s white face came up to his own. He knew that when he kissed this girl, and forever wed his unutterable visions to her perishable breath, his mind would never romp again like the mind of God. So he waited, listening for a moment longer to the tuning fork that had been struck upon a star. Then he kissed her. At his lips’ touch she blossomed for him like a flower and the incarnation was complete. (ibid.)

Despite the language of “incarnation” and “son of God” in these passages, it would be too hasty to locate Gatsby in the sphere of Religiousness *B*. Notwithstanding the religious hints Fitzgerald drops throughout the book, if Gatsby is anything resembling a Christ figure, the resemblance is both unorthodox (he is a bootlegger and an adulterer) and unwitting (though he voluntarily takes the blame for Daisy’s manslaughter of Myrtle, he does not foresee the lethal consequences of his act).

More would need to be said to fully justify locating Gatsby in the realm of Religiousness *A*. For Climacus associates this form of religiousness with other important but complex categories: e.g., suffering, guilt-consciousness, and the incognito of humor. Accordingly, my suggestion that Gatsby can be illuminated from the standpoint of Religiousness *A* is but a hypothesis that would require further testing against Fitzgerald’s complex protagonist. But, as a tentative judgment, it seems to me that Gatsby is higher than the esthetic sphere and lower than Religiousness *B*. Accordingly, he points up the limitations of the esthetic life-view of the Jazz Age without surrendering to the existential despair characteristic of his murderer, George Wilson, or his eulogizer, Nick Carraway. Gatsby shows us the poverty of one version of the American Dream, but his “extraordinary gift for hope” raises the question whether there are other, more mature versions of that Dream; and, if not, whether there could be or should be.

He continues: “if it should occur to anyone to want to quote a particular passage from the [pseudonymous] books, it is my wish, my prayer, that he will do me the kindness of citing the respective pseudonymous author’s name, not mine” (ibid., p. 627).",,False,,t5_2qh5b,1368420740.0,,,True,t3_1e87dg,http://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/1e87dg/kierkegaard_and_the_great_gatsby/,

I tend to think there's some truth to this, but I don't think it means the death of philosophy or that is should be relegated to a mere hobby. I think it's because the fields of progress in the past century or two have not been ones that required fundamental reconsiderations of the world. Steam engines, airplanes, computers, hybrid crops... these are things that can still fit, with some tweaking here and there, into the same worldview that we had before the dawn of the industrial revolution.

However, I think there are big changes on the horizon which will require us to think like philosophers again. These are the related concepts of **personhood** and **artificial intelligence.**

As we learn more about brains (human and non-human) and as computing systems get more sophisticated, we will begin to sail into unknown waters (I think we already have). We will need to develop new definitions about what constitutes a person deserving of rights and ethical consideration, etc. What would it take for a machine to be a person? What would it take for a non-human animal to be a person? If you take a human mind out of a body and put it into some other hardware, what does it become? Does it lose personhood?

I think these are questions that must be rigorously informed by science, but can ultimately only be addressed by philosophy.

------------------

Each opposition creates friction and competition, and is destructive rather than constructive. Humanity has moved from one form of in-fighting to another, and today there are deeply entrenched beliefs that separate us from one another. We have replaced our tribes with parties, and we proudly wear our respective colors in battle.

Could 'politicism' be another hurdle, after tribalism, racism, sexism, etc? Or maybe if we really learned the lessons from tribalism, we wouldn't have this political problem today?

People of different races contribute to a diversity, and once you're used to the concept, you not only 'tolerate' other races, ethnicities and languages, but you welcome them. Are we at a stage where we realize that people of different opinions are not only acceptable, but valuable?

Or is it a fundamentally different issue, since many beliefs are 'mutually exclusive', or infringe on the beliefs of others, and therefore more extreme political differences can never be resolved?

EDIT: I want to be clear, I'm not against the criticism of ideas, and I make a distinction between having an opinion on a topic, and bundling up a series of opinions into a rigit ideology that is fiercely defended a political party, or by any ""-ism"" cult... libertarianism, socialism, communism, etc. **So 'politicism' wouldn't be about taking a stand on an issue and defending it, but rather the awkward way in which people don't defend opinions, but defend entire ideologies and parties.** I think this is the wall that people have to overcome: instead of preaching for 'blue' or 'red', preach about the values which your color supposedly represents.",,False,,t5_2qh5b,True,,,True,t3_pvebq,http://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/pvebq/could_politicism_be_the_next/,

I feel as if there is something innate in nature that makes it higher quality than the man made world that we all usually reside in.  Spoiler alert: these ideas are not entirely mine and are pretty well influenced by the book Lila I have been reading lately by Robert Pirsig (continuation of Zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance) where he goes into depth on his quality centered metaphysics. It is a remarkably unifying and stimulating read that I recommend to everyone. That being said, I feel that the simplistic, dynamic nature of nature is what sets it apart and makes it more desirable. For the most part our world is constructed with a purpose from the get go and it is meant to keep that purpose all throughout its life, so it is much more rigid and opposed to change. Nature on the other hand is always changing and welcoming change and ultimately going with the constant flow of the forces affecting it. It is not contained by one unchanging definition so it is always a different experience from the last.

* ( We aspire towards tomorrow, and yet tomorrow brings us closer to death, the ultimate enemy.

* We look for meaning, but never conclusively find it. )
* Above all we believe we are significant, but the universe is cold and silent.

&gt; The human condition exists in a state of incongruence with the reality of the universe.

and reason cannot reconcile this, as it is paradoxical, and a paradox is an argument that produces an inconsistency (an incompatibility) within logic. Reason is therefore not a relevant 'tool' *for the individual.*

--

Camus, following a similar line of argument, stated that this is the absurd:

* The universe is cold and silent.
* We believe we are significant. [Edited, in order to better represent Camus. Originally said: We hope]

He stated that to deny either of these things is wrong, as that would be *to deny the absurd* 

He also argues:

* *Reason* makes us aware that the reality of the universe is cold and silent.
* *The human condition* causes our belief we are significant. [Edited, in order to better represent Camus. Originally said: ...causes us to hope]

Therefore he would stand against rejection of reason, as by extension it would be to *deny the absurd*

However, once reason has established, as knowledge within us, the fact the universe is cold and silent, rejecting it does not deny the absurd, as we still are aware of that one central truth. (And human nature is still driving us to our belief we are significant). [Edited, in order to better represent Camus. Originally said: to continue to hope]

It is like a stage theory.

Reason is important, but it is only one philosophical stage.
At the moment it makes us aware of the truth of the absurd it can be abandoned, as simultaneously we become aware of its limitations for us as individuals. However, it has performed its job...

I would just like to know everyone's thoughts on the idea of setting up philosophy classes in high schools (or if there are places where this is already happening.)  I'm writing this from the point of view of a young American watching our political discussion continuing to spiral downward, slowly abandoning reasonable discussion. Elected officials, pundits, authors, artists, journalists, businesses going around every day bending the will of the unarmed public with logical fallacies.  Then you look at the education system and we're continuing to make cuts, lay off teachers and make our problems as a country (and of course by extension the world) much worse.  I would create a curriculum that is funded by private donors and created and edited independently.  My goal would be to eventually make this a mandatory class.

I think we should be teaching our children to think properly and critically about the problems that face us, especially as we move into a new faster paced, technology-driven century.  The class I'm imagining now would be discussion based and extremely malleable to the interests of each specific class.  It would teach logical fallacies, some basics about how to form arguments and challenge students to look at everything from different angles.  A little ""Allegory of the Cave"" here, some Berklian discussions of perception as well as respectful discussions of hot button issues.  

What I'm interested in doing is creating an open curriculum run through the internet (I'm thinking a centralized blog with links to download all of the material).  I want to create a class designed to create critical, well-informed voters.  I think that this is the simplest thing we can do to radically change the future of our country for the better.

**EDIT** - so many awesome responses! I feel privileged to be among so many thoughtful critical thinkers. This topic must be on the minds of many around the world in the wake of recent global and domestic events.


**Upon reflection:** After reading every single comment, and replying to most, I believe I may have discovered a way too begin sorting this out. First we can recognize that everything is what it is. A truism perhaps, but what I mean is that everything animal, vegetable or mineral exists in a certain state from the moment it comes into being (regardles of assumption that this cause was supernatural or divine). No defense or explanation is necessary for this state of being. It simply is.

What becomes necessary is for an independent moral agent to provide a defense or explanation for acting to change that pre-existing or ""naturally occurring"" state of being. Thus, the naturally occurring state of being an Alive Human would necessitate a reason or explanation for an independent moral agent to take action that would cause the person to assume the state of being a Dead Human.

Lacking sufficient reason for causing this status change, I believe we can assert this Alive Human has an inherent ""Right to Life."" I may be paraphrasing the work of some other great thinker who wrote this same thing a long time ago, but if so I am still beyond tickled that I was able to think this up all on my own!

FINAL EDIT - If we accept the logical conclusion that all Alive Humans have a ""Right to Life,"" then what does this really mean?

This is currently the highest voted response:

No degrees contribute to the national economy on their own - those freeloading peices of paper don't go out and get jobs. People with and without degrees contribute to the national economy, and it is hard to credit the idea that liberal arts degrees designed to foster the creative and critical skillsets that define careful and innovative thinking reduce the productivity of an economy.

And second highest:

He got it all wrong. Economy is the support for our well-being... and our well-being is addressed by philosophy, art, literature... I don't think we would have any economy at all without having thought about human condition... You should remind him that Adam Smith, Karl Marx and many other economists were actually philosophers... and their goal was to create a better, safest environment to live in.

Let me express how sad I am seeing that some people actually think that. Those people take society and the economy for granted... they don't understand where they life they are living comes from.

Ask him where he thinks the economy comes from? why is it like that? what was the ultimate goal? And show him that it's the result of a reflection on how to improve humanity.

Money can't be an end. Improving our well-being is what matters and will always matters...

**He sent me this response:**

So if Nazi Germany or modern day 3rd world countries has had more ""ART"" things would have been / be better for those people? I never said that money (economy)  =  better society. I do subscribe to Adam Smith's economic theories and I think that wealth creates jobs.

Many of the mind-body problems presented to materialists are responded to with evidence from brain scans about brain activity. One of the more eye-opening realizations, I think, is that mystical experiences seem to originate from activation of a particular brain region, regardless of the nature of that mystical experience.

But this study appears to show something different. For anyone who's never done shrooms before, it's a very interesting trip that often involves a freedom from the conceptualization we use every minute of the day, a sense of connectedness to everything, a sense of the grandness of existence, and many would say it's something mystical in nature.

But whence this experience, especially this seemingly more richer and more expansive experience, if the brain activity is actually less. As I often accuse material reductionists, the response I expect is that it doesn't matter because all experience is necessarily and sufficiently caused solely by the physical interactions in the brain.

There's a particular line of reasoning I've come up against many times, which seems fallacious to me, and I'm wondering if there's a name for it. In my head, I call it the ""not as bad"" fallacy. Basically, it's when people try to dismiss a complaint by pointing out an example of something worse.

For instance, if I try to argue in favour of public assistance programs by saying that poverty should be mitigated wherever possible, somebody else might say ""There's no real poverty in America. Go to New Delhi if you want to see poverty.""

Or if a black man complains about racism after somebody crosses the street to avoid him, and a white person tells him ""That isn't racism. Black people being lynched is racism.""

Or if a woman complains about casual sexism in a work environment, and somebody tells her ""You're being over-sensitive. There are women in the world who can't even vote.""

Am I right in thinking that this argument is a fallacy? If so, is there a name for it? It sounds like it might be  [Ignoratio elenchi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignoratio_elenchi), but I'm not sure.

depression?",215,57,99,http://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/smjeq/could_this_be_partly_a_reason_for_existentialist/,"I’ve thought that maybe people nowadays are so depressed because we are in known of the time we are living in and ourselves. Back in the days for example history writing wasn’t as common as it is today. Today everything is being put into knowledge banks and every day we can read news about the smallest things that happen around the world. Everything is noted down and almost every citizen can know whatever they want. People are being put into registers and we know exactly (or at least we are excepted to know) who we are, what we do, where will we be in 10 years, what will we do for living…

As a contrast, in history people weren’t in known that “HEY, we are living the Medieval era, we are supposed to be like this and that!”. They just lived. They didn’t know they were going to be put into history books. Their life didn’t have a purpose on paper but they lived just for living. Only we, modern humans, are conceptualizing people in different eras and even ourselves. We are in known about that our actions are being written in papers and there will be books about our era’s people. Sometimes it feels like we are living in the papers, not in the moment!

(*I'm not a history researcher so there of course might have been signs of such phenomenons in Medieval era too, but not in such amount as nowadays. Medieval era is just an example.*)

Maybe all this knowledge is actually making people feel meaningless. Yes, I’m a high-school student, yes I’m applying for university next year, yes I’ve done this and that in my past and my income is blablabla. Psychology, biology, sociology and other branches of science are researching every movement of human behavior neurologically, biologically, psychologically and from humanistic point of view. If one wanted, they could find reasons for every act of theirs (or at least think they’ve found the right reasons). Our world is so conceptualized that even such phenomenons as shyness or feeling crush for celebrities are being listed as disorders. 

It’s like we want to know and research so much that the words on papers become us more than what we really are in real, present life. And higher education, of course, supports conceptualizing. We are supposed to be good at pointing out causalities, writing them down and being good writers otherwise, doing research, being able to make observations of our surroundings and put them down, memorize lots and lots of text for exams and so on. This all represents the admiring of written knowledge, written reality.

What he was most interested in, he began — I braced myself for mention of some next-generation stealth campaign — was stillness.

A few months later, I read an interview with the perennially cutting-edge designer Philippe Starck. What allowed him to remain so consistently ahead of the curve? “I never read any magazines or watch TV,” he said, perhaps a little hyperbolically. “Nor do I go to cocktail parties, dinners or anything like that.” He lived outside conventional ideas, he implied, because “I live alone mostly, in the middle of nowhere.”

Around the same time, I noticed that those who part with $2,285 a night to stay in a cliff-top room at the Post Ranch Inn in Big Sur pay partly for the privilege of not having a TV in their rooms; the future of travel, I’m reliably told, lies in “black-hole resorts,” which charge high prices precisely because you can’t get online in their rooms.

Has it really come to this?

In barely one generation we’ve moved from exulting in the time-saving devices that have so expanded our lives to trying to get away from them — often in order to make more time. The more ways we have to connect, the more many of us seem desperate to unplug. Like teenagers, we appear to have gone from knowing nothing about the world to knowing too much all but overnight.

Internet rescue camps in South Korea and China try to save kids addicted to the screen.

Writer friends of mine pay good money to get the Freedom software that enables them to disable (for up to eight hours) the very Internet connections that seemed so emancipating not long ago. Even Intel (of all companies) experimented in 2007 with conferring four uninterrupted hours of quiet time every Tuesday morning on 300 engineers and managers. (The average office worker today, researchers have found, enjoys no more than three minutes at a time at his or her desk without interruption.) During this period the workers were not allowed to use the phone or send e-mail, but simply had the chance to clear their heads and to hear themselves think. A majority of Intel’s trial group recommended that the policy be extended to others.

THE average American spends at least eight and a half hours a day in front of a screen, Nicholas Carr notes in his eye-opening book “The Shallows,” in part because the number of hours American adults spent online doubled between 2005 and 2009 (and the number of hours spent in front of a TV screen, often simultaneously, is also steadily increasing).

The average American teenager sends or receives 75 text messages a day, though one girl in Sacramento managed to handle an average of 10,000 every 24 hours for a month. Since luxury, as any economist will tell you, is a function of scarcity, the children of tomorrow, I heard myself tell the marketers in Singapore, will crave nothing more than freedom, if only for a short while, from all the blinking machines, streaming videos and scrolling headlines that leave them feeling empty and too full all at once.

The urgency of slowing down — to find the time and space to think — is nothing new, of course, and wiser souls have always reminded us that the more attention we pay to the moment, the less time and energy we have to place it in some larger context. “Distraction is the only thing that consoles us for our miseries,” the French philosopher Blaise Pascal wrote in the 17th century, “and yet it is itself the greatest of our miseries.” He also famously remarked that all of man’s problems come from his inability to sit quietly in a room alone.

When telegraphs and trains brought in the idea that convenience was more important than content — and speedier means could make up for unimproved ends — Henry David Thoreau reminded us that “the man whose horse trots a mile in a minute does not carry the most important messages.” Even half a century ago, Marshall McLuhan, who came closer than most to seeing what was coming, warned, “When things come at you very fast, naturally you lose touch with yourself.” Thomas Merton struck a chord with millions, by not just noting that “Man was made for the highest activity, which is, in fact, his rest,” but by also acting on it, and stepping out of the rat race and into a Cistercian cloister.

Yet few of those voices can be heard these days, precisely because “breaking news” is coming through (perpetually) on CNN and Debbie is just posting images of her summer vacation and the phone is ringing. We barely have enough time to see how little time we have (most Web pages, researchers find, are visited for 10 seconds or less). And the more that floods in on us (the Kardashians, Obamacare, “Dancing with the Stars”), the less of ourselves we have to give to every snippet. All we notice is that the distinctions that used to guide and steady us — between Sunday and Monday, public and private, here and there — are gone.

We have more and more ways to communicate, as Thoreau noted, but less and less to say. Partly because we’re so busy communicating. And — as he might also have said — we’re rushing to meet so many deadlines that we hardly register that what we need most are lifelines.

So what to do? The central paradox of the machines that have made our lives so much brighter, quicker, longer and healthier is that they cannot teach us how to make the best use of them; the information revolution came without an instruction manual. All the data in the world cannot teach us how to sift through data; images don’t show us how to process images. The only way to do justice to our onscreen lives is by summoning exactly the emotional and moral clarity that can’t be found on any screen.

MAYBE that’s why more and more people I know, even if they have no religious commitment, seem to be turning to yoga, or meditation, or tai chi; these aren’t New Age fads so much as ways to connect with what could be called the wisdom of old age. Two journalist friends of mine observe an “Internet sabbath” every week, turning off their online connections from Friday night to Monday morning, so as to try to revive those ancient customs known as family meals and conversation. Finding myself at breakfast with a group of lawyers in Oxford four months ago, I noticed that all their talk was of sailing — or riding or bridge: anything that would allow them to get out of radio contact for a few hours.

Other friends try to go on long walks every Sunday, or to “forget” their cellphones at home. A series of tests in recent years has shown, Mr. Carr points out, that after spending time in quiet rural settings, subjects “exhibit greater attentiveness, stronger memory and generally improved cognition. Their brains become both calmer and sharper.” More than that, empathy, as well as deep thought, depends (as neuroscientists like Antonio Damasio have found) on neural processes that are “inherently slow.” The very ones our high-speed lives have little time for.

In my own case, I turn to eccentric and often extreme measures to try to keep my sanity and ensure that I have time to do nothing at all (which is the only time when I can see what I should be doing the rest of the time). I’ve yet to use a cellphone and I’ve never Tweeted or entered Facebook. I try not to go online till my day’s writing is finished, and I moved from Manhattan to rural Japan in part so I could more easily survive for long stretches entirely on foot, and every trip to the movies would be an event.

None of this is a matter of principle or asceticism; it’s just pure selfishness. Nothing makes me feel better — calmer, clearer and happier — than being in one place, absorbed in a book, a conversation, a piece of music. It’s actually something deeper than mere happiness: it’s joy, which the monk David Steindl-Rast describes as “that kind of happiness that doesn’t depend on what happens.”

It’s vital, of course, to stay in touch with the world, and to know what’s going on; I took pains this past year to make separate trips to Jerusalem and Hyderabad and Oman and St. Petersburg, to rural Arkansas and Thailand and the stricken nuclear plant in Fukushima and Dubai. But it’s only by having some distance from the world that you can see it whole, and understand what you should be doing with it.

In a discussion about abortion I found myself coming to the conclusion that infanticide is not necessarily immoral. The train of thought comes from asking at what point is it immoral to abort a fetus. I found every argument seemed either arbitrary, inconsistently applied (more on this later), or based on unsubstantiated religious claims. The only position that makes sense to me is when a human ~~gains consciousness/~~is self-aware that it becomes immoral to kill them. To be extremely generous, this occurs no earlier than .5-1 years after birth (depending on the development of the baby). Society happily applies this moral principle to meat consumption, but is ever so slightly hesitant ( /s ) to apply it to humans. But there is nothing morally different between the two (imo), as they have the exact same state of mind and the fact that one's organs are arranged differently than the other seems arbitrary. So to me, it is inconsistent to apply one standard (killing any organism that reacts in a somewhat sophisticated manner to stimuli) to non-human animals as to humans.

Of course, if you are a vegetarian for moral reasons, than you needn't come to this conclusion (the appropriate conclusion would be abortion up to ~5 months of fetal development is fine IIRC).  Though I would question the merits of having that as the point at which it becomes immoral to kill, there isn't anything inconsistent about it and it is ultimately an arbitrary moral tenet type of choice.

Even for a near-emotionless, absent-minded-professor type of person like myself, this is a very disturbing conclusion and I'd be glad if someone could find flaws in my argument. Also, implementing this as political policy probably would probably have unintended effects when applied to a society that I haven't thought of, but for now I'm not very interested in that. Also, this obviously only applies when the parents are both willing to commit infanticide and are mentally sound, as killing other people's babies is immoral the same way destroying another person's TV (and personal property in general) is immoral.


edit: There was an interesting approach to the right-to-life of a conscious being in the comments. The argument is that while a conscious being has a right to life, that right doesn't necessarily have the same moral weight as the right-to-life of a self-aware individual. So for example, a pig is conscious but the happiness we get from eating bacon supersedes its right to life when you do a utilitarian calculation.
While this is acceptable, it still does not mean infanticide is necessarily wrong, just that it has to be done on a utilitarian basis.

One answer may be progressive taxation. Some key factors of what progressive taxation entails (taken from Wikipedia): A progressive tax is a tax in which the tax rate increases as the taxable base amount increases. Progressive taxes attempt to reduce the tax incidence of people with a lower ability-to-pay, as they shift the incidence increasingly to those with a higher ability-to-pay. It can also apply to adjustment of the tax base by using tax exemptions, tax credits, or selective taxation that creates progressive distribution effects.  

In general, it is an approach that attempts to create a more even distribution of wealth within a state.  

My question: are taxation systems that do not attempt to do this unethical? Is it ethical to allow multi-millionaires to continue to amass wealth while there are large portions of the society below the poverty line?  

Let us assume that wealth has diminishing returns on a person's quality of living after a certain level of it is reached. Given that, is shifting extra wealth from those making millions of dollars, and to who the additional wealth provides little, to those below the poverty line, to who it would benefit immensely, the only ethical decision to make? 

**TL;DR** Does somebody who makes 50M in a year have a duty to distribute a lot of that wealth to those less fortunate than him/her? Should the government make this decision for him/her through progressive taxation?

So if you replace every single part, one part at a time, and keep all of the original parts, you can put them back together as they were, creating a ship that is also the same ship.""

Theseus’s paradox recently [showed up on AskReddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/15cf72/what_is_your_favorite_paradox/c7l9ilr) and I want to discuss a possible solution I came up with:

If you replace a single part of a ship it's not the same ship anymore: The best name would be ""the same ship with a single part of it being replaced"" which we simplify to ""the same ship"" in order to reduce the complexity of information to a practical amount. The thought experiment exposes this small error of simplification/reduction by using a border case (""replacing all parts"").  
Therefore, I think, the closest simplified descriptions of the ships would be ""the ship built from new parts"" and ""the rebuilt original"". So none of them is ""the same"" or ""orginal"" because any further simplification would completely blur the process both objects went through.

How do you, personally, justify buying useless junk for your entertainment, when there is a fairly high chance giving the money you spend could actually save someone's life, if you gave it to charity for example.

If you are reading this, chances are you live in a fairly well developed industrialized nation. It's also likely that you own, just as an example, a gaming console, a fancy cellphone or an Apple product. How do you rationalize buying a fucking video game for 60$ when you know for a fact that there are people literally starving to death, and you could prevent them from doing so by spending your money on them?

I've never taken any classes in ethics or something similar, so I'd really love to hear about this from an academic perspective.

My personal favorites are:

""I already give to charity"" (Usually a pittance to appeal to your conscience while you spend 98% of your surplus money on things for yourself)

""My money wouldn't make a difference anyway"" (See above)

""It's God's plan"" (lol) 


Edit: Thanks for all the diverse opinions and information. Two things: Giving to charity was just an example, I might as well have said ""donate to cancer research"" or any act of self-sacrifice for a common good or the benefit of the less privileged really.

I'd first like to thank you for being in a solid subreddit, in my opinion at least.  I found philosophy about a year ago and this subreddit has been a wonderful forum to go to learn and engage in philosophy.  I'm having an issue, however.  More of a 'metaphysical crisis', I suppose.

I'm currently 21, and when I first stumbled upon philosophy I was astounded.  More specifically, I was amazed at all the questions being asked.  Ethical, political, metaphysical, I ate it all up!  

As I'm getting more into philosophy, however, I've noticed I've had more personal issues.  Bouts of anxiety, social withdrawal, etc.   This has stemmed from the metaphysical questions that philosophy tackles.  Topics relating to the ultimate reality, the existence of God, personal identity, etc.  As a 21 year old in college, it seems that no one is wondering about these things.  Hell, it seems like society in general isn't questioning these kinds of things!  I'm a generally social and charismatic person, but reading philosophy is absolutely crushing me and making me more distant from people.  It's as if I'm the most self-aware I've ever been and I'm starting to absolutely despise it. Plug me back into the Matrix for good; ignorance is indeed bliss. 

So basically, do the rest of you feel this way?  How do you cope?  Do you stay away from metaphysics, since in the end it's impossible to answer and instead move to more applied philosophy (ethical issues, political, etc)?  

Also, my degree is not in philosophy for that matter.  I've considered considered dropping philosophy as a hobby in order to pursue more vapid pleasures.  At the same time, I now consider philosophy to be the single most important thing and noble thing a human being can study in their lives.  So would I just be a coward for walking away?

Anyway, I'd appreciate any and all advice.  I'd post this on another subreddit as to not bog down this one with personal issues, but I feel only people that know philosophy can answer my questions.

And for what it's worth, I've read very little Kant, but I tip my hat to anyone that can get through him.  Not because he's dense (which of course he is!), but because you must be going insane.  

Edit - I'm very surprised and thrilled at the outcome of this.  Thanks to everyone for replying.  I've gotten so much wonderful advice and already feel better.  I'm currently at work and can't read and comment on the new submissions but I'll get to them tonight.  Again, thank you.

We’re a community dedicated to discussing philosophy-related topics, problems, and questions, but you should know some ground rules before you start posting or commenting here. Otherwise, you’ll sound like a goofball by misunderstanding the nature of this subreddit.

First, please read the guidelines set out in the [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/help/reddiquette). They’re there for a reason. Also, *check out the sidebar*. 

Here at /r/philosophy we follow a stricter set of rules for submission:

*A submission will be removed if the submission is deemed by the moderators to be unrelated to the academic discipline of philosophy, philosophical problems, the history of philosophy, information on particular philosophers, and so on.*

Second, *this is not a forum for you to abuse*. No one here wants to do your homework for you, but if you want *help* on your homework, ask your questions at /r/askphilosophy. The panelists will do their best to answer your questions or direct you to good resources. If you’re a student at a university, go to [JSTOR](http://www.jstor.org/), a high-quality resource. If you’re not a student, then there’s [PhilPapers](http://philpapers.org/). They’ve got thousands of free papers! 

Third, if you are going to post your own thoughts on a topic or ask a question *please* check out [the Googles](http://www.google.com), [Wikipedia](http://www.wikipedia.org/), [Simple Wikipedia](http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page), [Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy](http://www.iep.utm.edu/), [University of Chicago Podcasts](http://philosophy.uchicago.edu/podcasts/), or [Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](http://plato.stanford.edu/) first. If you want a good primer on issues in moral philosophy, please check out [blackstar9000's post here](http://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/tkcyn/a_brief_primer_on_some_major_issues_in/).

Fourth, *behave yourself*. Respect the opinions of others, even though (you may think) they are wrong. When reading about an idea that offends you, please remember that *you are not your opinions*. Furthermore, if you don’t think that you could possibly be wrong, then you are not in a debate. If you’re interested in the truth rather than winning an argument, you will try to find weaknesses in *your* arguments. Think first if your voice will *add to the discussion*. Respond to the argument and not the tone of the argument. On this subreddit, many people value being right over being nice.

Fifth, *do not just give your opinion*. Opinions are cheap; arguments are not. When prompted, you should be able to explain why a particular stance is preferable to others. It doesn’t matter if you’re wrong or right. It matters that you can put in the effort. If you don’t, people will call you on it, and you’ll look like you don't think much. And that's bad. Philosophers like to think. Got it?

Sixth, *be charitable to others*. If what they say sounds silly to you, just ask for clarification. This serves two purposes: (1) if they’re intellectually lazy and they lay the lazy all out, you can explain to others why they’re being lazy; (2) if they clarify something they said, you might understand their point better. If you don’t ask for clarification, then you might be arguing against a stance that no one accepts, wasting everyone’s time and frustrating everyone.

1294409973.0,149,self.philosophy,exwcr,Learning about philosophy is forcing me to confront some uncomfortable things about myself...,219,70,300,http://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/exwcr/learning_about_philosophy_is_forcing_me_to/,"For a start, I've come to realise that I consider my own consciousness/experience to be the most important thing in existence. By definition, to me, it's the only existence there is. Now, that doesn't mean I'm entirely selfish (although in a sense, I am), but it means that my objective in life is to maximize the quality of my own experience. Looking at the big picture, I'm as selfish as one can possibly be, but from an inside perspective it might not seem that way. Sometimes I will be acting in a non-selfish way in order to improve my life in a selfish way (such as helping someone in need, or doing a favour that I know won't be returned as it makes me feel happy).

""Quality"" is something that is constrained by the fact that I am human and experience certain mental constructs, like emotions and morality.

I am a moral person but only because I think that, ultimately, it's the healthiest way to live. It keeps me mentally happy (free of guilt, for example) and means that the people I associate with like me and think that I am a good person (which results in them treating me better).

If I'm honest, I'm slightly scared to realise this is my point of view. I've always considered myself a good person, but now I'm starting to think it's all just a façade. I just act good because I think that it leads to being treated better and it means my experience of life is better.

I just wanted to write all this down, and I thought someone a lot more intelligent than me could.... perhaps help me realise that this isn't necessarily the case. I don't think I want it to be the case, but I have to be honest with myself.

**UPDATE**  
You guys have really helped me out, I appreciate it. I feel like I've really felt a deeper understand of my existence today. It hasn't sunk in yet.

mbrock really helped me out. This is a summary of what I feel I have learned:

""Abandon all those illusory notions of good/evil, selfish/altruistic and just try to maximize love, beauty and good in what you experience... because that can't possibly be a negative thing in any sense, and those are the deepest, most satisfying things in the experience of a human being.

You are an animal that is only out for their own benefit, whether that's in the long term or the short term. Accept that, and accept that love, beauty and good are the height of positive experience. Try to maximize them.""

What now? What should I read next? I want to level up more. :D  

**UPDATE 2**
I didn't really want to start another thread for this... but here's my second question. What is beauty? What is love?

What do you think of this quote by Martin Heidegger?",171,27,104,http://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/me8te/making_itself_intelligible_is_suicide_for/,"This infamous quote comes from the following passage:

&gt; Those in the crossing must in the end know what is mistaken by all urging for intelligibility: that every thinking of being, all philosophy, can *never* be confirmed by ""facts,"" i.e., by beings. Making itself intelligible is suicide for philosophy. Those who idolize ""facts"" never notice that their idols only shine in a borrowed shine.

~*Contributions to Philosophy (from Enowning)*

Here, Heidegger reacts to the rise of logical positivism, which he claims is a 'degeneration' of thought; the fulfillment of the forgetfulness of Being. 'Those in the crossing' are those thinkers, trying to cross to a philosophy not confined to the metaphysical assumption that all that *is* ought to be measurable, perceivable, calculable, &amp;c. [In other words, to take Being as beings.] I think intelligibility, for Heidegger, means reducing philosophy to talking about facts. This would reduce philosophy to science, rendering philosophy superfluous, because science is superior performing this task. Philosophy should be something 'more' (or, at least: something 'else'), to differentiate itself from science. 

However, it does imply intelligibility is somehow inferior, as if philosophy is beyond or above science and 'normal understanding'. Furthermore, philosophy could slip into obscurantism (and Heidegger certainly balances on this verge). I would personally love everybody to study philosophy, but the reality is that not everyone cares about many of the philosophical investigations. So why reduce philosophy to the level where it is intelligible for 'the common man'? This sounds terribly elitist, I know. But, playing the devil's advocate, doesn't the record show the most influential philosophers in history were so brilliant, they only become fully intelligible after a long and rigorous study?

I think life is meaningful and full of opportunities for happiness, sadness etc; so this isn't a post about life being awful, I think life is great!

Can we really say that living would be better than dying one second from now, since if we die it's not like we will regret the opportunities in life that we're missing...  

Let me know if that makes sense, and what people think about it?

Edit:  I guess what I mean is that it's impossible to compare life to death, since they are fundamentally different.  So how can one say that one is preferable to the other.  I want to live to be able to enjoy things, but if I die I won't regret not being able to enjoy them, so death isn't a bad thing.

Let me give you an example: Since I was a kid I have always believed in a spiritual realm but recently (within the passed year or 2) my brain will not allow me to believe anything not backed by scientific fact.

Some questions.,163,30,116,http://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/1cogxt/heidegger_the_end_of_philosophy_and_the_task_of/,"Edit: I'm just adding this interesting reference on the end of philosophy, that discuss some of my questions in clear language:
http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00048409612347031

The most relevant part on Heidegger:

&gt;What we have to do, according to Heidegger, is to abandon metaphysics and simply 
'listen to Being'. Unfortunately, I have no idea what this means. The theologically 
minded sometimes identify Heidegger's 'Being' with God, environmentalists with 
Nature, but Heidegger specifically rejects both of these interpretations, even though there 
are passages which are relatively easy to understand only on one or the other of these 
readings. One thing is definite, however, that if we read as part of that listening, we shall 
have to turn, so he tells us, to such poets as Hoderlin. For only in poetry do we find 
what Heidegger calls 'a thinking outside of the distinction between the rational and the 
irrational'. 

&gt;Heidegger describes 'the end of philosophy' as 'the place where the whole of philos- 
ophy is gathered in its most extreme possibility'. But, as his 'Sketches for a History of 
Being as Metaphysics' makes perfectly plain, 'the whole of philosophy' turns out, so far 
as modern philosophers are concerned, to include no modern non-German philosopher 
except Descartes [11, pp. 55ff]. A Sorbonne philosopher, Yves Michaud, has written a 
commentary on David Hume with the title Hume et la fin de la philosophie [22]. And 
indeed Hume rejected many of the doctrines which Heidegger takes to be characteristic 
of the philosophical tradition. Heidegger does not seem to be aware of that fact, taking it 
for granted, perhaps, that Kant had totally answered Hume. 
At most, then, Heidegger would have shown that a certain Germanic tradition has 
reached its extreme point, which is its completion and its ending. And this is a conclu- 
sion which analytical philosophers could accept without any feeling of dismay, even if 
they might add that to make such metaphysics wholly responsible for the technologising 
of modern life is to give it far too great a political significance.

So, I'm a biologist and I have not much knowledge in philosophy, so excuse the naive questions. A friend recommended me, ""as a scientist"", to get interested into this as, he claims, it provides a critical view of science. I'm a bit puzzled by the content of this text though, as it seems to be full of bollocks. Maybe you can help me to go beyond this first impression.

Here's the full text: http://evans-experientialism.freewebspace.com/heidegger8a.htm

The text starts with the statement :

&gt; Philosophy is metaphysics.

It that true ? I though there was quite some different branches in philosophy: http://philpapers.org/categories.pl

Then in paragraph  5. he goes about asking the main question of the text: ""What is meant by the talk about the end of philosophy?""

He explain that by ""end"" we shouldn't understand ""end""  (one could ask why use the word ""end"" in the first place then, and yes I know it's a translation) but ""that place in which the whole of philosophy's history is gathered in its most extreme possibility""

Is that true, historically, is there really a ""gathering of philosophy in its most extreme possibilities"" around 1960 ? I never heard about that.

I don't really understand why he's saying this at this point, but here comes another statement:

&gt;Throughout the whole history of philosophy, Plato's thinking remains decisive in changing forms. Metaphysics is Platonism.

Again is that true? I mean I get that Platon is an important figure in philosophy but that seems a bit too simple to be true. What about say, Epicurus, isn't that non-platonic metaphysic ?

Then he argue that the end of philosophy is characterized by the emergence of sciences from philosophy:

&gt;The development of the sciences is at the same time their separation from philosophy and the establishment of their independence. This process belongs to the completion of philosophy. Its development is in full swing today in all regions of beings. This development looks like the mere dissolution of philosophy, and in truth is precisely its completion.

Do the emergence of sciences really look like the dissolution or completion of philosophy ? I mean philosophy seems quite diverse and incomplete to me, and not really dissolved. 

The argument for the establishment of science independence is:

&gt;It suffices to refer to the independence of psychology, sociology, anthropology as cultural anthropology, to the role of logic as symbolic logic and semantics.

Are sciences really independent of philosophy? I had the - maybe naive - idea that at their bases their was always a lot of philosophy. 

Next statement:

&gt;Philosophy turns into the empirical science of man

Is philosophy really turned into an empirical science ? I think I've read some ideas about experimental philosophy, but I'm not sure that's a very popular idea.

Next paragraph:

&gt;No prophecy is necessary to recognize that the sciences now establishing themselves will soon be determined and steered by the new fundamental science which is called cybernetics.

So, 50 years later, did the non-prophecy turned out right ?

Well, I'll stop here. I think it's enough questions already :)

Please stop asking it.",205,71,84,http://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/b7y6b/is_ethical_is_more_often_than_not_a_terrible/,"While it certainly does not make up a significant percentage of /r/philosophy posts, the hardly insightful ""Is this random thing ethical/moral/immoral?"" posts that crop up every other day or so really irk me, though perhaps that's just due to my own moral nihilism. 

That being said, it seems to me that every question asked in the above format is not the right question to ask.  When this question is asked, the discussion is effectively forced into ""Which ethical philosophy do you subscribe to?"" because, ultimately, the particular thing which you are trying to determine the morality of, is merely a variable in the larger ethical equation, and it's that equation which determines the morality.

If someone asks ""Is political lobbying ethical?"", the moral relativist redditor says ""Sure, it's legal, so it's ethical,"" the utilitarian redditor says, ""If you can prove that it is beneficial to the greater good, than sure, it's ethical,"" the freshman undergrad philosophy major redditor says, ""It doesn't pass the categorical imperative test, so no it's not ethical,"" and the moral nihilist redditor says, ""It doesn't matter."" 

Swap out ""political lobbying"" for just about anything, and watch the responses remain effectively constant, with merely a different truth value.  Asking a particular ""Is _______ ethical?"" question will almost never propagate comments more insightful than those above, never more insightful than people inserting the particular topic into their pre-established ethical philosophy.

(Keep in mind also that the question is asking whether or not the thing is ethical, which assumes that there is in fact one correct answer, and so the form of answering which follows is never even an acceptable answer, as it can almost be boiled down to a listing of the various moral philosophies' party statements.  The question will have no real answer, and so it is a bad question to ask.)

Ethics are certainly an important area of inquiry, but these are not the right questions to ask.  Instead, ask about the ethical systems themselves, analyze and debate the very moral groundwork that you disagree with, or perhaps more importantly the groundwork that you DO agree with.  Debates on the ethical systems themselves can be very productive, and they serve to give clearer answers to the particulars.  If you are really personally torn on a particular issue, then theoretically it should be because you aren't sure how your moral philosophy would handle that particular, and you could ask, ""Is political lobbying ethical according to utilitarians?"" which would be an appropriate, and useful question.

1. The argument was made that r/Philosophy was cluttered with memes, jokes, text-image quotes, and other rubbish of little philosophical value; however, this rubbish was not limited to links and photographs only, and continues to be present in self-posts, as well. In terms of meaningful content, self-posts and links are equivalent.

2. Now that we are self-post only, it takes an additional click to get to any outside content. Additionally, users are unable to see, from a glance, what websites content links to. If I see that a link is from imgur, and I'm not in the mood for a picture, I don't click on it. The self-direction of my own content consumption has been partly usurped.

3. The idea that the front-page is cluttered, and thus better content is inaccessible, is silly. Those with RES simply scroll farther down, and the distinction between first and second page is near meaningless. Removing content for the mere reason of clutter seems like using a canon to kill a mosquito.

4. The idea that memes, jokes, or pithy quotes are bereft of philosophical heft is preposterous. As Wittgenstein said, ""A serious and good philosophical work could be written consisting entirely of jokes."" It seems like r/Philosophy has sought fit to dismiss Wittgenstein in favor of their own aesthetic comfort, without adequately arguing against this idea.

5. Censorship. Functionally, this act -- the banning of specific content due to its *medium* -- is censorship, plain and simple. To me, a Philosophy sub-reddit should strive not to censor the philosophic views, comments, or beliefs of its members, and the medium by which someone chooses to express themselves is an integral element of their expression. This censorship was done in the name of philosophical heft, though -- as I mentioned in point 4 -- no sufficient argument was made to support this belief.

**TL;DR** The banning of specific content has done nothing to improve r/Philosophy, has in fact made it worse, and involves the questionable (and undefended) censorship of philosophic expression.

**EDIT:** 6. This very post is some of the same ill-reasoned, half-baked, armchair drivel the direct-links ban sought to eliminate, and yet it I #1 in r/Philosophy right now.

",502,368,939,http://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/okq0l/every_time_i_walk_into_ratheism_i_have_an_aneurism/,"I need to rant a bit. Please view some of the ad homs I have committed only for entertainment, which act as reading lubricants for [/r/atheism](/r/atheism) atheists who stops reading when words like ""philosophy,"" ""metaphysics,"" ""epistemology,"" etc. are used.

Looking at some of the top posts in [/r/atheism](/r/atheism) was truly a great way for me to increase my blood pressure. I just did it again after a few weeks, I guess nothing changes in that subreddit. 

I see many self proclaimed ""super atheists"" commit the most elementary epistemological and sometimes even logical errors that they themselves proclaim to fight against. Just **why in the fuck** do they believe that the *foundationalistic, verification empiricist-heavy* is the only way to obtain true knowledge? Surely, justification is highly subjective, and to speak from an extreme point of view, even *knowledge* can be. I swear, they're all childish logical positivists of some sort. Note I'm using the term ""all"" rather *healthily*. 

This is pretty much what I see happening in r/atheism:

""Christianity and many other religions are false, as they have no solid evidence or verifiable data, and I only believe what I can see""

""I don't believe in illogical things, I only believe in reality""

""I only believe in science because empiricism and induction can stand up to anything""

""Science can answer just about everything""

""I only believe in what is real and what I can see""

""There is an objective truth out there""

""My beliefs are founded in science""

The examples I've given here are not exact copy/pastes, but a kid in [/r/atheism](/r/atheism) probably has said them once or twice or thrice or all of them.

OK, I can agree with *their* philosophical viewpoint of empiricism and fact-checking. I have nothing against this proposition. Note that I have **NOTHING AGAINST** a *foundationalistic, verification empiricist-heavy* viewpoint. However, they seem to be completely unaware of the contemporary problems of empiricism and naturalism. **Granted**, philosophers who were leading empiricists ALSO understood the philosophical problems of their beliefs, but chose to hold onto them, because they believed them to be the best way to obtain knowledge, DESPITE knowing its shortcomings. I have no fucking problem with this. In fact, this is what I fully support. 

But I don't see this happening in r/atheism. It's all circular arguments in there. The fact that they are so damned sure that their beliefs and propositions of how true knowledge is obtained is absolutely correct is what makes me &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;. **Any** attempts to show them the weakness in such thinkings through using good epistemology and perhaps even logic is shot down, made fun of for being ""Christian"", insults upvoted, ragecomics are made that make fun of this ""retarded child-like logic"", *ad nauseam*. It literally feels like as if the.... *gasp* ...us ""liberal arts majors"" with an elementary background in philosophy are infinitely more rational and reasoning than the people in r/atheism. Fin. 



p.s I am willing to let them ignore the entire school of thought of metaphysics, since naturalistic empiricism makes it somewhat completely irrelevant.

* Thanks for pointing out that an omniscient, omnipotent being couldn't possibly exist, but is that really the be-all and end-all? Has that been decided definitively? By whom? (I'm not being sarcastic, I'm curious)

* As for whether or not it's a pointless question, I really don't think it is. I'm asking a question about the nature of action and motivation. The question could be rephrased as: why does a being act? To what end? And at what point have they achieved that end sufficiently that they would no longer have motivation to act? (I know it's a very different question, but it still gets to the heart of what I am trying to discuss).

* A being who is omnipotent and omniscient has no desires because, being omniscient, they know all their own desires from now until infinity, and being omnipotent, they can grant those within the first ""instant"" of their existence. All desires would therefore be achieved and sated by such a being in an infinitely small amount of time. For all intents and purposes, such a being has no desires, and would not act.

* The origins of this being are not what I am interested in discussing.

I need your help. My university, Cedarville University in Cedarville, OH, is facing some trying times. The administration (specifically, the academic vice president) has announced its intention to cut the philosophy program and fire one or both philosophy professors (Dr. Dave Mills [Penn State], and Dr. Shawn Graves [Rochester]). The move is ostensibly to save money, but the numbers don't add up- the philosophy program turns a profit and Drs. Mills and Graves sell more credit hours per-professor than most other departments on campus. 

Drs. Mills and Graves are outstanding men who both embody the ideals of community. They teach their students to think critically and interact charitably with all arguments and positions; I have the utmost respect for them as academics and teachers. Additionally, both have served their community often literally with the coats off their backs. Put simply, they don't deserve this and Cedarville needs a philosophy program.

Students and alumni (including myself) have started a protest movement. We've started a [blog](http://ourcuprotest.wordpress.com/) and a [petition](http://action.groundswell-movement.org/petitions/restore-critical-thought-to-cedarville-university) ; I would encourage any of you who are interested to contribute to the former and sign the latter. The office of the academic vice president (Dr. Tom Cornman) can be reached at (937) 766-7770. Additionally, if any of you are university professors or similar, I would encourage you to spread word of our plight. We need all the publicity and help we can get.

I am constantly hearing people cheer for the torture and death of those who sexually abuse children (though this rhetoric remains mysteriously absent when the offending party is a clergymen.) Our entire society is bloodthirsty when it comes to these individuals, and our laws and media fuel the fire. 

Does no one recognize the insanity here? *Yes*, these are horrendous crimes, but our society behaves like a wild mob when dealing with them. It's as if our entire justice system is forgotten and the only acceptable path to follow is barbarism. The most outrageous part is that those calling most emphatically for death are seen as stewards of justice! 

Where is our civility!? Civilization means nothing if we can choose to embrace murder when it is popular. I can't even have a discussion for the sake of debate, because playing devils advocate here always ends the same way. ""You must be a pedophile too!"" ""Why would you defend child rapists!?"" ""Do you like children being raped!?""

Does our system of laws, which are intended to enforce (among other things) our ethical code even mean anything when they can be forgotten (or manipulated) given a proper level of outrage?

I argue, there is no crime so categorically evil that more death is it's only solution.

As a lot of  what s/he touched on was first-order stuff. And there are lots of discussions debates on here that have some implicit metaethical assumptions, or what have you. 



**What is Metaethics?** 

Metaethics (also spelled meta-ethics) or second-order ethics consists in questions about ethics itself. ""Meta"" in Greek means a number of different things. However in the sense it used here (and used mostly today), it means ""about its own category"". So metaethics is the study not of ethical questions regarding action or maxims; rather the study of ethics itself. This leads to a number of different categories of metaethical inquiry such as, but not limited to: epistemic, metaphysical, linguistic (or semantic), and psychological. 

To give an example,

* Jane utters ""stealing is wrong""

This is a first order claim, as it is a normative, or prescriptive claim. It's a claim about what you ought, or in this case ought *not* to do: steal.

* If John responds ""is it really wrong? On what grounds do you make this claim?""

This is now a metaethical question. As the question is no longer about what we ought or ought-not do (first-order); rather it is now about the reasons/baseline assumptions and what she means when she makes this claim (second-order).

**The Relationship Between Metaethics and Ethics**

Now that you (hopefully) have a basic understanding of the difference between first and second-order ethics, let's discuss how they bear on one another. In his now famous (or perhaps infamous) essay *The subjectivity of Morals* J.L. Mackie espouses the view that:

&gt;First and second-order views are not merely distinct but completely independent: one could be a second-order moral skeptic without being a first-order one, or again the other way round. A man could hold strong moral views, and indeed ones whose content was thoroughly conventional, while believing that they were simply attitudes and policies with regard to conduct that he and other people held. Conversely, a man could reject all established morality while believing it to be an objective truth that it was evil or corrupt. 

So for example, one of my professors is a metaethical relativist. He believes that our morals are not objective; however he also likes to use the following first order example, ""It's is wrong to set puppies on fire."" There can also be first-order agreement/consensus amongst people who have very different metaethical views. Take for example the recent Supreme Court Case, [*Maryland v. King*](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-207_d18e.pdf) saw a lot of agreement between conservatives and liberals about the use of DNA testing (the consensus being that it's a violation of liberties) but if asked to explain their reasons for holding this position, each side would give very different answers. 

**Naturalism v. Non-Naturalism**

So the nature of moral facts is very contentious. It's divided into two main camps, naturalist and non-naturalist. 

* Naturalism: the view that moral facts correspond to the some features of the natural world. e.g. good, beneficence, retarding suffering, etc.

On the flip side,

* Non-Naturalism: the view that moral facts correspond to something beyond or different than any feature of the natural world. 

Non-Naturalism might strike you as something similar to the Platonic Forms, and it should. So each position obviously has its benefits and disbenefits. For the naturalist, there are is no appeal to any odd metaphysical claims or any special intuitive abilities in the epistemic domain. Whereas the non-naturalist does not have to account for the apparent difference between say, the term pleasant and good. It is an open question if something that is pleasant is good. But thinking something is pleasant isn't the exact thing same as to think it's good so we must be attributing distinct properties to good. Which leaves the question open as to whether or not facts are natural or non-natural (This is G.E. Moore's open question argument). 

**Cognitivism v. Non-Cognitivism**

This is a semantic argument about whether our moral claims have any cognitive (truth-value) to them. 

* Cogntivists: claim that an utterance like ""Rape is wrong."" is either true or false. Regardless of which answer you give, in engaging with the question you are agreeing that it has cognitive content. 

A quick side-note: cognitivism is interesting in that it is the assumed mode of moral talk. When we discuss issues it is almost always in terms of right/wrong (true/false). This isn't to say that this makes cognitivism correct, simply that it's interesting that it is our default.

* Non-Cogntivism (Expressivism/Emotivism): Is the claim that an utterance like, ""rape is bad."" is neither true nor false. Instead it expressed the speakers feelings regarding rape and is analogous to a claim like ""boo rape! I dislike rape!""

Hume stands (contentedly so) as a possible progenitor non-cognitivist. He thought that our judgments only ever expressed our passions. If we claim that there is no cognitive content to moral claims, we have effectively dissolved much of the first order disagreement. This means that first order disagreements are quibbling over who can scream louder and like the 'right' and hate the 'wrong' things. So there is some serious appeal to non-cognitivism, however it is also a radically counterintuitive position. 

**Reasons Debate**

One of my personal favorites. There are two predominant views again (notice a trend?) Reasons internalism and reasons externalism. First lets talk reasons, there are two kinds 

* Normative reasons are the reasons we have for action 

and 

* Motivating reasons are the reasons that explain why we acted the way we did. 

When an agent's normative reasons are her motivating reasons she is fully rational. Bernard Williams is a prominent (and perhaps the most prominent) reasons internalist. 



* Reasons Internalism: we only ever have reasons (moral or non-moral) to act when we have a desire in our motivational set, and deliberate from said to desire to a normative reason. 

So motivation precedes reason on this internalist account. Contrasting this with 

* External reasons, which are categorical and, thus, remain normative regardless of an agent's motivations, are exemplified by things such as well-being, duty, logical thinking, etc. 

Where the two overlap is that they (often) agree that irrationality obtains when an agent's normative reasons are not her motivating reasons. There are lots of sub-tangents regarding weak-will or self-deception that follow from irrationality. But for now all you need to know that there are either external normative reasons, or there aren't. 

Derek Parfit's most recent book has quite a large section on Reasons (if anyone wants it I have the PDF) and really does well to lay out what's going. Basically some of the implications are, for the internalist, I don't ever really have reasons for say, helping someone who's about to drown, If I don't have the motivations/desire to do so. To some this sounds crazy, and I can see why. (Personally I find myself somewhat sympathetic to Internalism, though that maybe because of my affinity for Williams). On the flip side internalism explains things like accepting Singer's argument for vegetarianism, but not taking yourself to have any reason to give up meat. 

**Moral Responsibility and Moral Luck**

This can get a bit thorny as there are some very nuanced free will debates that encompass everything from hard determinism (that is we have zero free will) to compatibilism (a mix of freewill and determinism) to radical freewill (something that Sartre advocates). However our concern here is with the conditions of Moral responsibility and they immediately lead to issues of moral luck. 

Prima facia, we want to hold agents responsible for their actions. If Jack joins a gang and is subsequently arrested for some crime, we are holding him morally responsible for his actions. However, when we look at the brute luck that Jack experienced (say he came from a poor family, absent parents, no other tenable options) it seems that luck has had a heavy hand in determining the outcome. I liken it to having a buffet with a few shitty options, Jack seems somehow less responsible for his poor eating habits if all he ever has in front of him is spam, a big mac, and Oreos. So the debate here isn't quite as clear cut, though there are a wide reactions to moral luck and its bearing on moral responsibility. There are those who deny it as a salient phenomenon (though this I think, is an untenable position) and there are those who want to varying degrees of moral responsibility relative to the choices an agent had (this is something like my own view) and there are those who say ""to hell with responsibly, luck is responsible for everything. Again not a view I think is all that good). Long story short, moral responsibility seems to require some bit of freedom, however in light of moral luck it's unclear we have that freedom. 

**Relativism v. Objectivism**

The last thing I'll touch on is moral objectivism v. relativism. Where we say, 

* Objectivism: the view that moral facts are objective/normative regardless of human ascent or cultural agreement. 

For example, after the Sandy Hook shootings here in the US, you'd be hard pressed to find someone who said what happened that day was 'okay' 'allowable' or 'good'. The universal decrying something like this (and other school shootings, genocides, etc.) draws out an objectivist intuition that, yes, there are somethings like rape, murder, genocide, that we won't gerrymander or budge on. (Note that being a relativist does not entail you to saying that SHS was okay or that genocide is fine, like I've pointed out there can be first order consensus for those who have divergent second-order views)

* Relativism: The view that morals are constructed and relative to a given culture/society/small group. They do not exist outside of culture, but rather are an important feature of it. 

So consider any of the differing putative moral disputes between cultures. In the middle east it's not uncommon for men to marry 12, 13, 14 year old girls; Here in the US that is a crime. (Again not passing judgment just making empirical claims.) This kind of disagreement underscores some relativist intuitions about morality.

**Now that you have an understanding of Metaethics go forth and piss off all your friends by asking them, ""but is that really wrong/right?""** :) Cheers.

I was raised by devout Christians (who I had to move back in with due to financial stuff), and so I was always taught that death was something I didn't need to be afraid of, because I would go to heaven when I died.  Fast forward years later, and I've been an atheist for about five years (family doesn't know this).

When I talk with my dad about atheism in general, one of the things he always says is that he can't imagine not believing in an afterlife.  To him, the idea of ceasing to exist when he dies is absolutely terrifying.  Most atheists I know would counter this by pointing out that if we cease to exist, it won't make any difference to us.  And for a long time, I've found comfort in that thought.

Lately, though, the idea of ceasing to exist has made me feel anxious, and I'm not sure why.  So, since I don't have a lot of people I can talk to about this right now, I just wanted to throw the question out there.

I often wonder why exactly it would matter if someone chose to kill themselves, or why such a big deal is made of it. How exactly is one to say that suicide is a negative when there's no regret from the victim afterwards? Clearly if you're going to seriously consider killing yourself and have the guts to proceed with it, then you're more than likely under circumstances to do so. It's a fairly weak conception to believe that because you're living, there's only one obvious decision, which is to continue living because you feel as if you've in someway been blessed with a certain sense of ""individuality"" which you're committed to. There really is no sense of individuality though, the self is really living in such a close relation with everything else that there really is no differentiation or distinction between the two. The only individuality we have is in regards to a social institution. If there was no society for us to find our part in than we'd have no form of identity whatsoever. How do you explain yourself in terms of yourself. The only way you can explain yourself is in comparison to other people. 

For instance, if you were to live in a society where everyone was an aspiring music artist and who all liked Kraft Dinner macaroni, not only would the society not accomplish anything of any significance, but no one would feel as if they had any sort of individuality or originality in the society they lived in, there would also be a great amount of competition. Or if you lived completely by yourself in the wilderness, you'd never have anybody to compare yourself to, you wouldn't know how well you clicked with another human being or if your personality was ""correct"" by anybodies expectations, but I digress. 

Say for instance you're extremely depressed, you'd just gotten fired from your job and your girlfriend dumped you. There's this massive burden over your shoulders to get your life back on track and meet the predefined standards of living your ancestors before you had shaped and the ones your current peers have modified and solidified. And now you think to yourself, ""Well there's no one I can turn to anymore, this world is cold and brutal, I've been fucked over time and time again, and I really see my life going no where."" Right then and there you pick up the gun, point it at your head and shoot yourself in the face.

What exactly is the significance of that? It's one of the most radical decisions you could possibly make, but there's nothing to be seen or heard afterwards, there's even nothing to think. You would never regret it or think about it, there would be no reflection or sorrow, there wouldn't even be peace or serenity. All those words are descriptions of concepts we feel as a human entity. After you shoot yourself, all there is of yourself anymore is an identifiable lifeless body dead in our reality that eventually decomposes and enriches the soil with nutrients. 

Maybe that's the importance of our lives on an ecological scale, to die and enrich the soil for more plants to grow.

1326671007.0,123,self.philosophy,oij73,"Nietzsche, Free-will, Buddhism and Wittgenstein ",147,24,146,http://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/oij73/nietzsche_freewill_buddhism_and_wittgenstein/,"Nietzsche On Genealogy of the Morals wrote the following:

&gt;For, in just the same way as people separate lightning from its flash and take the latter as an action, as the effect of a subject which is called lightning, so popular morality separates strength from the manifestations of strength, as if behind the strong person there were an indifferent substrate, which is free to express strength or not. But there is no such substrate; there is no ""being"" behind the doing, acting, becoming. ""The doer"" is merely made up and added into the action – the act is everything. People basically duplicate the action: when they see a lightning flash, that is an action of an action: they set up the same event first as the cause and then yet again as its effect.

That seems to be very similar with Buddhist non-duality stance (from wikipedia)

&gt;Non-Self in Buddhism is the Non-Duality of Subject and Object, which is very explicitly stated by the Buddha in verses such as “In seeing, there is just seeing. No seer and nothing seen. In hearing, there is just hearing. No hearer and nothing heard.” (Bahiya Sutta, Udana 1.10). Non-Duality in Buddhism does not constitute merging with a supreme Brahman, but realising that the duality of a self/subject/agent/watcher/doer in relation to the object/world is an illusion.

Which lastly brings us to Wittgenstein and one of his most know propositions:

&gt;4.003 Most of the propositions and questions to be found in philosophical works are not false but nonsensical. Consequently we cannot give any answer to questions of this kind, but can only point out that they are nonsensical. Most of the propositions and questions of philosophers arise from our failure to understand the logic of our language. (They belong to the same class as the question whether the good is more or less identical than the beautiful.) And it is not surprising that the deepest problems are in fact not problems at all.

What if the question of free-will vs determinism is in fact a problem that arises only because our language is structured in a way that requires that for every action there must be an agent behind it and ultimately is in fact not a problem at all?",,False,,t5_2qh5b,False,,,True,t3_oij73,http://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/oij73/nietzsche_freewill_buddhism_and_wittgenstein/,

Zeno of Elea
 
*My writing is an answer to the partisans of the many chairs and it returns their attack with interest, with a view to showing that the hypothesis of the many chairs, if examined sufficiently in detail, leads to even more ridiculous results than the hypothesis of the One Chair.* 

Seneca the Younger
 
*If I accede to Parmenides there is nothing left but the Chair; if I accede to Zeno, not even the Chair is left.* 

Aristotle
 
*All men by nature desire to know chairs. An indication of this is the delight we take in our senses; for even apart from their usefulness chairs are loved for themselves; and above all others the sense of sight. For not only with a view to action, but even when we are not going to sit, we prefer sight to almost everything else. The reason is that this, most of all the senses, makes us know chairs and brings to light many differences between chairs and other things.* 

Thomas Aquinas

*It is one thing to show a man that he is in error, and another to put him in possession of a chair.*

*Methinks I am like a man, who having struck on many shoals, and having narrowly escap'd shipwreck in passing a small frith, has yet the temerity to put out to sea in the same leaky weather-beaten vessel, and even carries his ambition so far as to think of sitting in chairs under these disadvantageous circumstances.*
 
Immanuel Kant

This is a follow-up to [this post.](http://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/auy6j/tomorrow_i_will_have_lunch_with_my_philosophy/)

It was the first time I had seen him since he revealed he was a “young earth creationist” on the last of class in December.  He looked genuinely glad to see me, and greeted me with a firm handshake and a smile. We sat, and almost immediately took up where we left off on the last day of class.  I told him I was shocked by his revelation, as I never would have guessed he was such a religious man. Curiously, he thanked me and said he was just doing his job. He then expressed his belief in the importance of conversation and never shying away from hard questions.

I brought with me 5 pages of comments from my initial posts in /r/atheism and /r/philosophy and presented it to him. There were many very good statements, questions and other offerings and I thought he would enjoy reading, and possibly discussing in one of these forums. I asked him to visit us. I didn’t ask anything specifically from these posts, but I did try to find out how he came to his worldview. So I asked about his childhood.

He told me he was raised in North Texas, by deeply religious parents.  After elementary school he was pulled out of the public school system and was home schooled. He shared with me that his school day included 2 hours of academic work, 2 hours of bible study and “4 hours of playing the guitar.” He admitted that he was born into the church, educated in the church and had never known any other life. He said I could call it ‘indoctrination’ if I wanted.

I confronted him about having a presupposition, and he replied that we all have presuppositions, arguing that even Carl Sagan began with the presupposition that “in the beginning there was the cosmos.” I was not so surprised that he had a theistic world view but wanted to know why he was a fundamentalist Christian, so I moved on.

He continuously insisted that the bible is perfectly consistent, and referred to it as “the scriptures” throughout our conversation.  He talked about “Christ” having a divine plan that is beyond the comprehension of the human mind, and this is why some parts of the bible seem strange to us. He told me that god created this world some 11,000 years ago to resemble a planet that is billions of years old; rocks with depleted carbon14, fossils in sandstone, canyons, mountains, and a moon with millions of meteor craters.  He cited a discovery of helium in the Grand Canyon that provides evidence for his hypothesis.

Our time ran short, as he had a class to teach, so I asked his political views. He told me he was not involved in politics outside of the church, and does not participate in protest and the like, but he believes the ‘scriptures’ are very clear about things such as homosexuality. Then, almost apologetically, expressed disappointment that the government played a role in marriage at all. 

I felt we both could have stayed much longer, but he had to get to his class, so I fired a big one at him as we were walking out the door.

“Professor, do you think my soul is going to burn in hell?”

He smiled and promised, “I’ll answer that question next time.”

I know he will.

Me: sausage, onion, pepper, tomato and cheese (american) omelet with pancakes (butter pecan), coffee. 
Him:  ham, cheese (cheddar) and potato omelet with pancakes (maple), milk and OJ.

I'm in the process of proposing an English seminar at the high school where I teach, entitled Philosophy in Literature. At the same time, I'd also like to in the near future propose a philosophy club that is more than just a lunch meeting club - something more substantial with actual connections to philosophical organizations, chances for scholarships and awards... Something in the vein of NHS (National Honors Society). The only thing is I've been searching for hours and it seems that there only exist organizations for college or post-grad. I think I would be willing to look into putting together something in the realm of a Young Philosophers Association, a non-profit or something of that sort, but again, it would be good to have connections to an institution of higher learning so that the students get connected to philosophy at the next academic level and so on. 



I would love to discuss ideas with you guys, as I'm fresh out at the moment.  This is a bigger undertaking than I can do alone I think, and I'd love to hear what you guys think and know. Thanks everyone!




**EDIT: Thank you all for so many awesome ideas and responses!  I'm really looking forward to developing the class curriculum in May once I'm done with my MA in Philosophy (I'm swamped between school and work right now, though I do want to look into at least some basic plans for all of this).**


**At this point, the thing I'm really looking into help for is the club.  I think at this point I want to create a Young Philosophers Society, which compromises of high school students in various high school chapters.  I want to (eventually) get to the point where the various clubs at different schools get together for a yearly high school philosophy conference (various locations) and have students present papers and have keynote speakers and such.  Of course, this is going to take a lot of connections and eventually I hope to build some partnerships with maybe the CSU and UC systems (I'm in Southern California by the way) at first and get some scholarship opportunities and awards and such, and maybe open it up to other programs in the distant future.  I would also love to eventually do two publications a year (Fall and Spring issues) in which the students submit their work and publish it in the society's own academic journal.**

An Ubermensch is one who realizes that there is no God, or no Other, that can give meaning to his or her life. The knee-jerk reaction to hearing this is that of pure nihilism. Life is inherently meaningless if a greater power does not give us meaning.

Nietzsche took it a step further. In this vacuum of meaninglessness, he  performs a transvaluation of morality. He creates the Ubermensch - someone who creates his own moral code and consistently lives by it with the zeal of the most pious religious man. The fundamental difference being that he has created his own standard himself, and thus has overcome the existential angst that plagues all modern intelligent beings who have long since forgotten God and the fact that he is obsolete.

According to Nietzsche, the Ubermensch has, through pure will, achieved mastery of the self, and the overcoming of the self. Every instance of the Ubermensch's life is one of life affirmation, or love of life - both the good and the bad. This is also called *Amor Fati*.

**What are your thoughts on this philosophical system?** 

I hope that we restrain from making irrelevant references to Nazis (whose philosophy has been bastardized by Nietzsche's sister) and that we refrain from Nietzsche's incredibly strange life. Not to mention the abundance of contradictions in his various works.

Taking classes from home through the wonder of the internet, and having only a dial-up connection which is my punishment for living on the wrong side of the river, I have the opportunity while waiting for the next page to load to play a lot of Minesweeper. There are many parallels to that ubiquitous game and developing a systemic view of the world.

If you don't know how Minesweeper works, the player clicks on a grid to reveal empty territory which is good, a mine, which ends the game, or a number indicating how many mines are adjacent to that space. When the game begins, the player is forced to take a shot in the dark, much like the young person seeks to find his own beliefs wherever he or she can. Sometimes things work out okay, and sometimes the thinker gets burned by the consequences of making an incorrect choice. The thinker usually learns from his early mistakes, and the player can of course just start the game anew. Eventually the player finds an open space, and all contiguous open spaces and their adjacent spaces with indicators are revealed, just as the young person eventually finds a system of belief on which he or she can agree with others, and suddenly many of his or her beliefs are adopted from the group, and the lessons that others have learned about the consequences are passed on. 

The large revealed area gives the player enough information to begin to see how the system of pieces fits together, and makes it easier to determine where the mines are hidden. The play advances rapidly during this portion of the game. The more spaces that are revealed the easier it is to reveal more spaces, just as the thinker begins to see the patterns in his or her beliefs, and how they are congruous or incongruous to the world, and will thus refine the edges of his or her thinking to match the available data. As long as one thing leads easily to the next, he or she learns a lot very quickly, easily avoiding the pitfalls inherent in life.

Eventually the game becomes more difficult. A solid row or column of indicators indicates a large number of adjacent mines, just as some issues in the real world are fraught with consequences and moral peril. The player must carefully use reason to determine where the mines lay, not so much by indication of where they are, but by determination of where they cannot be. Logical inconsistencies will help the player eliminate certain spaces as having mines, and he can reveal those spaces, just as logical inconsistencies can be identified in certain beliefs in the real world, and those beliefs can be eliminated so that the thinker may move closer to the truth, and avoid the consequences of making the wrong choice in a difficult situation.

Finally a point will come in the game, once, or even over and over, where no amount of logic will determine the way forward. There simply isn't enough information to determine whether a given space contains a mine, just as in real life there is sometimes simply no way the thinker can be sure he or she is making the correct choice. When this occurs, usually late in the game, the player is forced to determine the probability that a given move is correct, and choose to reveal the spaces that have the lowest probability of being mines. Given that situation, the adept critical thinker will adopt the belief or action that is most likely to be correct.

At the very highest level of play, the player must choose from among multiple courses of action that have equal probability to be correct, and must choose the course that will be most beneficial by revealing the most information. That's true in life as well. The thinker must choose when presented with multiple options that are otherwise equal the one that if it proves acceptable will be the most beneficial.

All of this is a simplification, of course. In Minesweeper there are only two possible final outcomes. The player will uncover a bomb and lose the game, or he or she will determine the location of all the bombs and reveal all the remaining spaces, thus winning the game. In life, benefits and consequences are widely variable. Indeed, the priorities of a given thinker may make one set of benefits and consequences preferable to those chosen by a different thinker. What is important is that each thinker clearly defines his or her priorities, so that the benefits sought and consequences avoided are the most important to him or her. The thinker must seek information to determine how the chosen course will impact those priorities, and to what degree.

Just as in Minesweeper, the way forward is best navigated, once things start to get complicated, by looking at how all the adjacent pieces fit together. Only by determining what makes sense for all the surrounding pieces, can the best possible choice be made. In life, there are far-reaching ramifications to the choices we make. In most cases, however, the most impact occurs closest to the field in which the decision is made. As the ramifications reach farther, their impact becomes less. Ramifications are also buffered by the fact that, of the seven billion human beings on the planet, the individual choices made by one tend to have little overall effect. Still, the thinker must do his or her best to determine how he or she fits into the system, what impact the decisions made will have, and, how best to use his or her own influence to effect the changes in the whole system that he or she has prioritized. If that process is completed, then benefits will be maximized, and consequences will be minimized according to what is important to the individual thinker, and the courage to choose a belief or course of action will naturally present itself.",,False,,t5_2qh5b,False,,,True,t3_qd0qv,http://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/qd0qv/what_minesweeper_tells_us_about_thinking/,

Ever since I read the article, this line of reasoning has appeared (that is, I've become increasingly alert to it) in news articles, discussions on ethics and even in fiction such as books and movies.

I'm uneasy with it as a justification, although I know that the proposition is true in most cases. In Williams' example there's a further implication: the guy that will otherwise get the job is not as scrupulous thus making the utilitarian reply (take the job) even more obvious.

Now, I'd like for this *not* to turn into a discussion on utilitarianism, but rather on this line of reasoning as a justification for less than perfectly ethical (according to the one taking the action) acts.

This is going on R/atheism and R/philosophy because I really need help.

I have serious concerns regarding my transition from Christianity to Agnosticism. I grew up in a very Christian family. I called myself a Christian and was very into doctrine and missions and believed myself to be born again and what not. 

Over the last year, I started reading more and started questioning my faith. Basically, I no longer see perfect evidence for Christianity or Evolution. Both are too bold. 

I see good evidence for both. I see the pluses and minuses in each. BUT I have also seen liars, hateful, dishonest people, and people who twist the truth on BOTH sides. The truth is distorted.. what can I know? 

I basically came to a point where I believe that there is absolute truth but it is impossible to find it. (It is interesting because I claim that I don’t know if I can know the truth, and still made a truth claim on my belief. It doesn’t even make sense) I started thinking these things when I realized that there are good arguments for and against certain things (ethics, and just truth in general)
People that are much more brilliant than I have come to different conclusions: Dawkins, C.S. Lewis, Isaac Newton, Darwin, ect.. How am I, a person of inferior knowledge, going to find out the truth? Again, I do believe there is absolute truth, and I just can’t accept that there isn’t. 

Being a skeptic is horrible. I find answers nowhere. I find peace nowhere. I am so used to this idea of God and have been so indoctrinated that I don’t think I can accept that there is no God.

I am lost and confused and am very depressed. 

Have any of you experienced this same dilemma? How did you overcome it?

Please answer to the best of your ability (my sanity may depend on it) and don’t just down vote. 

Help me! Thank you!

I really love you guys and appreciate all the help! I will read through all your comments many many times!

So before posting this question I went and searched past posts on Objectivism and all of the refutations seem to center around Ayn Rand or the fact that it is based on axioms. After all [Münchhausen Trilemma](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BCnchhausen_Trilemma) pretty much states that axiomatic is only one of three options so this cant be a valid refutation of an entire philosophy. Personally I feel Rand is uncritical and dogmatic, but simply have a hard time arguing against objectivism despite my feelings on the matter.

So I am just looking for a refutation of either her 3 axioms, which would refute the whole system, or a logical flaw in the philosophy. **Not** ""Ayn Rand is so dumb no one takes her seriously"" I already realize this, I am asking WHY.

Edit: So far the best responses, other than outside links which I have yet to work through, either are: 

1) Agree to disagree because Objectivism is an axiomatic system. However, I do accept, or would like to accept the axioms at least in this exercise to see where logically/practically Objectivism breaks down. Simply rejecting on axioms is not enough for me, despite the fact that others have rejected axioms. 

2) There are issues in here ethics in that the principle of self-interest is necessarily contradictory, though I remain somewhat unconvinced by these. It seems plausible that under the system Objectivism imagines, one could get by perfectly fine with everything on the free market and nothing given for free. While potentially unattractive, simply because something is unattractive does not mean there is reason to refute it.

Here's my favorite Kaufmann quote for those unfamiliar with his work.",142,20,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/gsafr/the_audio_lectures_of_one_of_my_favorite/,"There may be surprises in store for us [after death], however improbable it seems and however little evidence suggests it. But I do not hope for that. Let people who do not know what to do with themselves in this life, but fritter away their time reading magazines and watching television, hope for eternal life. If one lives intensely, the time comes when sleep seems bliss. If one loves intensely, the time comes when death seems bliss.

Those who loved with all their heart and mind might have always thought of death, and those who knew the endless nights of harrowing concern for others have longed for it.

The life I want is a life I could not endure in eternity. It is a life of love and intensity, suffering and creation, that makes life worth while and death welcome. There is no other life I should prefer. Neither should I like not to die.

If I ask myself who in history I might like to have been, I find that all the men I most admire were by most standards deeply unhappy. They knew despair. But their lives were worth while - I only wish mine equaled theirs in this respect - and I have no doubt that they were glad to die.

As one deserves a good night's sleep, one also deserves to die. Why should I hope to wake again? To do what I have not done in the time I've had? All of us have so much more time than we use well. How many hours in a life are spent in a way of which one might be proud, looking back?

For most of us death does not come soon enough. Lives are spoiled and made rotten by the sense that death is distant and irrelevant. One lives better when one expects to die, say, at forty, when one says to oneself long before one is twenty: whatever I may be able to accomplish, I should be able to do by then; and what I have not done by then, I am not likely to do ever. One cannot count on living until one is forty - or thirty - but it makes for a better life if one has a rendezvous with death.

Not only love can be deepened and made more intense and impassioned by the expectation of impending death; all of life is enriched by it. Why deceive myself to the last moment, and hungrily devour sights, sounds, and smells only when it is almost too late? In our treatment of others, too, it is well to remember that they will die: it makes for greater humanity.

I think I can sort of motion towards the concept--describing various elements of it--but find it difficult to truly express. I might say it involves a passion for someone, an openness, a letting down of one's usual social guards and masks, and in return one accepts the other with their guards similarly let down. There is also, at least in western tradition, an aspect of reserve--that is, this sense of openness is to be reserved simply for one person for it to be meaningful. The word love in this sense also seems to have an element of commitment, as in, no matter what this relationship leads to, one will, within reason, promise to keep true to it through thick and thin, that is, in the long run its something that is worth working for.

Now I could go on, but ultimately find myself unsatisfied with this sort of analysis. There's a load of concepts that seem somewhat related but I'm left wondering what that core relationship actually is, that core meaning of love. Perhaps that's the point, it is to be felt not said. But that doesn't seem right to me, surely love can be expressed somehow? I suppose it may only possible to express it through actions rather than words, which might be a good thing? I don't know.

Anyway, I would like to read what interesting philosophers have had to say about this sort of love but not sure where to start. Any suggestions? I'm also interested in what r/philosophy's own thoughts are.

So yeah, I'm very familiar with Marxist and Neo-Marxist thought in social theory, but I've never heard Conservative philosophies being rigorously stated to that extent. Sure a little ""Up From Liberalism"" here (link: http://www.amazon.com/Up-Liberalism-William-Buckley-Jr/dp/0812829697 ), a dash of ""The Road To Serfdom"" there, but that's really it, and they don't hold up to the mountain of scholarship in other areas.

tl;dr Who's the Marx of Conservatism? (along with the other stuff I asked)

    *Il n'y a qu'un problème philosophique vraiment sérieux: c'est le suicide.*

&gt; There is but one truly serious philosophical problem, and that is suicide. Judging whether life is or is not worth living amounts to answering the fundamental question of philosophy. All the rest — whether or not the world has three dimensions, whether the mind has nine or twelve categories — comes afterward. These are games; one must first answer.

I see all those people living their lives and sometimes I just can't imagine how come they don't become crazy to the end of their lives, since I am getting to think more and more about the purpose of life and that there is only one answer for everything and that will come with death only. (Or if there's no afterlife, the answer won't come, but still that is an answer somehow.) Wondering about this topic can get my mind off everything, regardless of its importance for the usual peoplem because everything loses its point if we have no eternal souls and will just ""die"". And if that will happen, why shouldn't we shoot ourselves in our head right now? Of course there are many sweet things in life to live for, but if our consciousness will stop existing, what is the point to live our life through?

It seems to me that in both cases, there should be more ""local"" group wisdom involved. Can the extended family sustain a new mouth to feed in a pinch? Does the community need a larger population? Given some limited resources, are there genetic traits that should be considered and given preference?

With regard to death, there are cases where it seems a loving family should be able to decide to end a parent's life, for example--the state need not be involved. Or with regard to abortion--perhaps there should be more people involved in the decision to terminate a fetus as each trimester progresses (as an example: just the mother should decide in the first trimester, the mother + father must agree by consensus during the second trimester, the mother + father + doctor must agree during the third).

To save you a click, here is the gist of it:  

**Tallon**:  I don't believe in being offended. For someone to offend me, that would mean their opinion is more powerful to me than my own.  

**Druuseph**:  How would it mean that? If I yell 'Cunt' as loud as I can in a crowded room and it offends someone that doesn't mean that they are lesser people for being offended, it means they have expectations of others behavior that were broken and nothing more. Now I feel the same way in that it is hard to offend me but I'm not going to pretend that I couldn't be offended or that it's weakness, that's a fallacy to state that.  

**Tallon**:  I don't think they're lesser people for being offended in that situation (is there such a thing as ""lesser people?""), but they are certainly different. I think it would indicate they are more empathetic, where as I tend to be very rational.  If someone yelling ""CUNT!"" in a crowded room offends me, that means I am allowing them to dictate my emotional state to me. It means that I am giving their opinion of what is appropriate in this scenario more weight than my own. I'm not willing to do that.  
  
I'd love to hear any thoughts on this perspective.

As someone in neuroscience, philosophy often amuses me a bit because it seems sometimes like many of the people involved in it forget that philosophy is done by humans, who, as you know, are not free of cognitive biases or millions of years' worth of nervous system evolution.  I'm not saying this is a predominating idea in philosophy, because it probably isn't (I don't know enough to claim one way or the other), but I've stumbled across what seems to be a sort of biological and psychological denial from time to time in my philosophical reading, as if philosophical proclamations are alleged to be made by rational actors and not, essentially, three-pound lumps of meat that have been evolving for four billion years.  Personally, I think philosophy needs to have more cross-talk with those of us in neuroscience and psychology.

I'd like to start a discussion on this:  Where do you see philosophy intersecting with psychology and neuroscience in an evaluation of philosophy itself, since all of philosophy has been produced by brains?

Here's why I am a mitigated skeptic:
""I think therefore I am"".This completely destroys any absolute nihilist theory about the existence of reality,that being said,I have no way to be sure that what I observe is the real deal, that it exists(I diverge from Descartes on this point).I only know that I exist for sure, and solipsism becomes a very hard notion to refute since there is no way to escape my perception of reality and observe it as an external entity.But as I said, I am not a solipsist, as I pull the aproach of a mitigated skeptic to the subject.This ""realm"" may or may not exist, so I better act as if it did, for my own sanity.
And that's how I came to be a ""mitigated skeptic""(like Hume).

Being a ""mitigated skeptic"", I am also an agnostic, I can't even be sure that this laptop exists, let alone God.With this in mind, in my POV, to assert something beyond the existence of my consciousness as truth is naive, as it is  for someone to be  sure that reality, let alone God exists.If they believe in that, they are either  ill-informed or commiting a logical fallacy.

---

I recognize I might be the one comitting the fallacy here, and therefore the one who is naive.But I do not think it would disrupt my point that taking something as granted when the only vision we have of the world is subjective is, in fact, naive.In fact it is what I am doing, I am taking for granted that taking something for granted is naive, and therefore I am being naive, and that might, or may not, just prove my point.

I've been pondering this for a while. From what i can tell, the biggest problem in ""government"" in general seems to be corruption. If we follow a good person from the start of his politic journey to the end, it really is a toss up if he can stay true to his ethics or if he will sell out....secretly, or publicly. 

It makes me wonder if the only way perfect governance can be achieved is through some form of artificial intelligence. I read fairly often in r/politics about sentors who vote for bills without reading them or those who vote for things which later financially benefit them in some way. The human element here is so strong, that i'm debating if i should even blame these people or not. I'm in no way shape or form wealthy but if i was given the opportunity to secure myself and my families' future by allowing X contractor to take Y tax paid job without a bid, i believe my own needs would outweigh the needs of the many...namely those who i do not know (like you). 

It starts me down a path of thought where i wonder if the things that make me human and a functional animal existing under the ""survival of the fittest"" coding could operate safely under the ""survival of all"" (like ants) mantra. If not, should this not automatically remove me from qualification for governing those who i..realistically...barely care about (strangers like you)? The more i think aout it, the more i think it is the only logical conclusion i can reach. There is no logical way i can be in charge of the betterment of all, if i am more interested...on a genetic level, in the betterment of myself and my own offspring. 

The only place i can fathom this going to find coherent ideology and execution is in an artificial life form which is solely tasked with the survival of all mankind and the happiness of all. A machine can be designed to do just abut anything and that includes learn and become free thinking. There is an equation there somewhere in how we think/learn and as long an artifical intelligence understands that its own survival rests on our survival (the human species) then would it not be able to more competently and more completely define laws and govern all of us?

A few more thoughts to justify this:

- Artificial intelligence could ""think"" or ""debate"" 24/7 thousands of times faster then a human.

- Artificial intelligence would not have gentic instincts which could sway its decisions.

- Artificial intelligence would Be (more then likely) an entirely logical machine and not an emotional one.

Anyone who advocates abandoning the tradition of philosophy has no understanding of philosophy and its purpose, as I understand it. We're part of an intellectual tradition, and to understand the contemporary philosophers such as Foucault (or Russell, or Chalmers, or MacIntyre), you really must understand the Structuralists he was reacting to. And to understand them you must understand the Existentialists and Neo-Marxists, and them the Phenomenologists. All the way back to Socrates in the West. (Something similar could be said of the Eastern tradition of philosophy)

If you don't understand that tradition, then contemporary philosophy WILL look meaningless and strange and as if a bunch of ambiguous words are being thrown around. But this is a reflection of your ignorance, not the ignorance of these mega-minded individuals.

If you haven't really studied any of the tradition, then of course the only stuff that will make sense to you are analytic and mathematical models of particular things that can clearly by modeled with formal logic. Everything else philosophers talk about becomes unclear and obscure without the tradition.

So please, go pick up The Republic. And do not think about how wrong Plato's characters are. Do not think about your position as you read the book at all. Follow Plato along as he helps you explore the realm of ideas through the perspectives of many different individuals.

____________________________________________________________

“Music is the universal language.” Aphoristic as this phrase may be, it does relate something many people think about music: music is expressive. But if music is expressive, what, exactly, does music express? For that matter, how does music express? Is the content or manner of expression of music the same as the content or manner of expression of language? In answering questions such as these, we promote previously empty cultural aphorisms about music like the one presented earlier to the status of meaningful claims.

David Lewis highlights two important features of language – language as an object and language as a practice. I will present a view of the nature of music held by Peter Kivy, comparing it to Lewis’ conception of language. I will then argue that by Kivy’s view of music, music is not a language, though it has more language-like properties than Kivy admits.

To briefly take stock, we might highlight four general properties of language we should look for in the determination of whether or not something is a language:

1.	Syntax – Lewis’ grammar operations. Determine legitimate strings.
2.	Semantics – Lewis’ meaning. The meaning of a well-formed string is the situation it describes in a set of possible worlds.
3.	Truth Values – Derived from comparing the meaning of a sentence with our world.
4.	Conventional Activity – a population arbitrarily determines a language used by conventionally using the language to express truth.

Peter Kivy endorses a formalist view of music. The formalist doctrine is that music is a type of sound structure. Generally, we think of a structure as something we can appreciate visually; the word usually evokes mental images of certain spatial relations of objects to other objects. But according to the formalist, sound structures are “temporal patterns of sound”  (emphasis added). To put this in a vocabulary familiar to musicians, sound structures are just combination of types of sounds (such as pitches, percussion, etc.) that occur in some timeframe. Music has formal properties and sensuous properties: a piece of music’s formal properties differentiate it from other pieces of music; i.e. certain notes are played in a certain order, the piece is a certain speed, and there are certain rhythms. And music’s ‘sensuous properties’ boil down to the fact that – shocker – music is a heard medium: we hear and notice different aspects of sound events when we experience music.

Kivy’s view of music directly supports the inclusion of one of the important features of language in music’s nature. He says that music has a “special kind of order: the order of syntactical structure.”  He says that this order is governed by rules (of a sort); these rules concern how different sounds should be combined in the production of a musical work. For example, it is a staple of the syntax of certain schools in western music that there should be a return to the tonic at the end of a musical phrase. This syntax differs for different genres of music, much like it does for different languages. Certain chords can be used in certain genres, and not in others – for example, you will see flat V chords used in chord progressions in jazz, but not most pre-modern forms of classical music.

But I think we have reason to believe that the nature of musical syntax is very similar to the nature of linguistic syntax. First of all, I question the assertion that the rules of linguistic syntax are stricter than the rules of musical syntax. For example, take the English grammar rule that the first letter of the first word in a written sentence is capitalized. I think this easily qualifies as a syntactic rule of written English; however, prominent writers have violated it throughout history (E. E. Cummings is one obvious example), and people today often violate it when talking to one another through electronic media such as texting on the phone and messaging online. I think we still want to say that these people are using English – they are just temporarily disregarding a grammar rule of English, which is more of a regularity than a law. However, though some rules of linguistic syntax are not absolutely strict, I do think that there are rules which are inviolable. Lewis’ rule that there is a finite set of elementary constituents paired with meanings that we can use in the construction of sentences is of paramount importance when using a language. I can’t type out a random assortment of characters and expect that configuration to be an English sentence.  Similarly, certain combinatorial grammar rules are absolute.

And it seems to me that musical syntax has very similar characteristics to this conception of the characteristics of linguistic syntax. There are certain rules which can be bent; a piece of music can preserve its status as a piece of music in a certain genre regardless of whether it follows a specific syntactic ‘regularity’ of this kind. This is similar to syntactic rules like capitalization mentioned in the previous paragraph. Then there are certain rules which must be followed for a piece to be classified as a member of a certain genre – relate this to how a string must follow a certain instantiation of the grammar rules Lewis established to be characterized as a member of one language rather than another.  Then there are certain rules any genre of music must follow to be music rather than mere noise. This is similar to syntactic rules any language must have; a language must follow the general rules Lewis gives us, in one form or another.

We can also see that the activity of music is analogous to the activity of ‘language’ that Lewis describes. Music is not just an entity, but also a social activity concerning musicians and listeners, wherein musicians make certain noises and they expect their listeners to respond a certain way. And I see no reason why we wouldn’t say that this activity is in some way arbitrary, however limited that arbitrariness is by the hard-wiring of our brains to enjoy certain sounds. 

The parallels between music as ‘language’ do not stop there. Music shares the ability to infer something about the state of mind of a composer or musician with language (substituting ‘speaker’ for ‘composer or musician’). Playing a guitar solo in a minor pentatonic scale allows us to infer one (admittedly broad) set of things about the mind of the guitarist, while playing in the blues scale allows us to infer something else. And we often make the same inferences as many other listeners. These inferences might also be wrong – as they might be in the case of ‘language’. And Kivy’s view that these inferences are not ‘in the music’ doesn’t stop us from saying that we make these inferences; we can say that we respond ‘by convention’ to a certain sound structure in a certain way without saying that there is anything about the sound structure that makes us respond this way.

So far, so good, for the view that music is a language. Nothing that I have said thus far about Kivy’s view of music has conflicted with the definition of language Lewis gave us. And although I haven’t gone into the nuts and bolts of correlating Lewis’ grammar rules with musical syntax, it’s not hard to see how a story could be told relating them – in every way but one: what could we say corresponds with the meanings described in rule one and two? Kivy qualifies his formalist definition of music: “absolute music is a sound structure without semantic or representational content”. 

This is a big problem for a proponent of the view that music is a language. One of the essential characteristics of language is its status as something which can communicate meaning; some might call this property the most important property of language. And on initial reflection, Kivy’s claim seems to hold a lot of weight. How could music talk about situations in the external world? A song might represent ‘victory’ or ‘striving’ or what-have-you in some obscure, abstract sort of way; but it certainly does not have the power to describe in the incredibly detailed, content-rich way a language can. Music could never have the power to express the meaning of such sentences as “My flight to Los Angeles was delayed because of poor conditions on the runway.” This is a crippling observation in particular for anyone who thinks that my method of deciding whether music is a language is valid – without sematic content, two of the four properties of language Lewis defined go down the tubes. The absence of semantic content in music obviously bars us from saying that music has semantics; and, because music is free of semantic content, truth values are gone as well, as truth values are products of comparing the meanings of sentences with the world.

The avid supporter of the music-as-language project has two avenues open to them at this point. They might object to Kivy’s view the music is free of semantic content; or, they might object to the view of language – specifically, the view of semantics – that Lewis gives us. I’ll start with the objection to Kivy.

An obvious route someone objecting to Kivy’s determination that music is free of semantic content might take is saying that it does have semantic content – and this content is emotion. Music represents emotions the same way language represents the situations its sentences describe. Maybe the ability of music to describe things in the world is much more limited than language, but its ability to describe emotions is even better than natural languages’ ability. Thus music should be described as ‘a language of the emotions’.

Kivy has a response to this claim, but I find it to be unsatisfying. He says this assertion gets you “from enhanced formalism in letter and spirit to a musical semantics in letter, not spirit, and enhanced formalism, still, in spirit.”  He thinks that music can say nothing interesting or significant about emotion, and somehow this yields the result that music does not have emotional semantics. But the ability to say something interesting about what it denotes is not what defines the semantics of language – it is the ability to say what it says that defines language. In other words, it is the ability of sentences to denote at all which makes them linguistic. If music can do this, then it has semantic content.

The problem is, we are wrong to say that music denotes emotion in the first place. I think Kivy is right when he says that emotion is a “heard property of the music” . Music does not ‘represent’ sadness; it just is sad, the same way that an apple just is red. And the reason we perceive these emotions in music is due to the fact that music can formally resemble how humans look and act when they feel certain emotions. Unfortunately, I can offer no positive reasons to accept this conception of emotion in music other than emotions are certainly a part of music in some capacity, and this formulation of their relation to music is the least problematic one I know of. 

And perhaps I can pose some problems with representative views of music that serve my intuitions well: for one, many people think that to be a real language, every sentence in that language that denotes a state in the world can be translated to a sentence in another language. How might one go about translating something music ‘says’ to English? Attempts usually produce a clumsy, single-word emotional descriptor, which varies from person to person. Another thing people think stems from a representative medium is the presence of truth values. We can say of a linguistic proposition that it represents our world, or it represents a situation not in our world; propositions of the first type are true, and propositions of the second type are false. But what would we say about music corresponds with a state in the world? It seems a very odd practice to listen to a phrase in Beethoven’s Fifth and say of it that it is ‘true’ or ‘false’.
 
On the other hand, the supporter of a music-as-language view might challenge the definition that Lewis provides of semantics. He might use music to help define language, as Andrew Bowie does in his book Music, Philosophy, and Modernity. He says “if people understand a piece of articulation – which is apparent in terms of its effects in social contexts on behavior, reactions, feelings, and so on – it must mean something.”  Bowie equates language with Lewis’ ‘language’, the social activity, and discards the properties of ‘a language’. Because music is a social activity by which people effect specific changes on others’ behavior or feelings, music has meaning, and therefore is a language. 

But Bowie betrays his own cause when he tells us what follows from this new definition of language in a quote by Bjørn Ramberg: “’We can, if we like, interpret all types of things as speaking’”.  This definition of language allows us to call all types of things language that push against our intuitions on the subject. Arriving late to a meeting is now language, because others’ thoughts are influenced to think worse of me for being tardy. Playing a sport with other people is now language, because their behavior is altered when they respond to my sporting actions. Maybe you want to call these things language, but I suspect the majority of people do not.

It is important that a practice we choose to call language should have aspects of ‘a language’ and is used by the practice of ‘language’. This successfully delineates language from non-language. The presence of truly semantic content is one of the principle factors in deciding whether something is a language. Even though music seems to have every property of the practice Lewis identifies as ‘language’, it cannot be a language.

1323174465.0,112,self.philosophy,n2fpc,"The ""hard"" problem of consciousness",147,35,272,http://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/n2fpc/the_hard_problem_of_consciousness/,"I find the distinction between “hard” and “soft” problems illuminates more than anything how flabbergasted most people still are in contemplating crossing the objective/subjective divide. It illustrates how inconceivable bridging that explanatory gap has seemed to be. And that tells how little most of us still understand. It turns out, however, there are a great many reasons to conclude that the brain indeed does create consciousness. What had been lacking until relatively recently was an overarching framework or theory through which to grasp the nature of consciousness. The lack of a general theory of consciousness, of how it comes to be that there is something that it is like to be, was really the last rational bastion of opposition to the scientific assertion that consciousness emerges from the brain.

The solution to the hard problem is rather simple. It has been so hard to see for certain evolutionary and cultural reasons. The solution is that the “self” is an illusion. The conscious part of us is actually a representational process. For simple reasons of caloric efficiency, to survive, humans have only needed to assume that they directly experience reality. This is now clearly false. We do not directly experience reality. We have various limited sense organs through which, from an existence far richer than we can perceive, information about the environment is taken in and an estimation of reality constructed. Other species construct a different map of the same external world from different sets of senses. Some have eyes tuned to a different slice of the electromagnetic spectrum. Some use echolocation, some are sensitive to electromagnetic fields, etc.

It isn’t at all the case for example that you “see with your eyes.” You see with your visual system. But we didn’t need to know that to survive. We didn’t need to know that when you saw a large feline predator of mostly orange coloring with black stripes, you were, strictly speaking, seeing a representation of a tiger. We just needed to know to get the fuck out of dodge. If you had a brain tempted to make the likely correct philosophical intuition that your experience of reality is actually virtual, those extra milliseconds could cost you your life while in danger, and in most cases, if not under direct threat, until very recently the extra caloric cost of that higher order thought process of a representation of a representation would just make you hungrier faster without much evolutionary benefit.

We are not just naive realists in our understanding of the external world, but clearly (especially?) we are equally naive realists in our understanding of our internal world. Hence, the common cultural dichotomy of body and mind, and the often magical explanations of consciousness. We don’t experience the neural underpinning of consciousness, and thus if what we experience is what is real, consciousness is inexplicable and magical. ”Any technology sufficiently advanced is indistinguishable from magic.” We just happened to be born in “technological” equipment like that.

The nature of agency itself is thus tied to the extent to which modern neuroscience may or may not be indicating that consciousness itself and hence all of rationality might function in the brain as a special kind of sense perception of the world. I recommend Thomas Metzinger’s Graduate Council lecture at UC Berkeley for a quick overview of the self-model theory of subjectivity. This is the first paragraph of his book, Being No One:

“This is a book about consciousness, the phenomenal self, and the first-person perspective. Its main thesis is that no such things as selves exist in the world: Nobody ever was or had a self. All that ever existed were conscious self-models that could not be recognized as models. The phenomenal self is not a thing, but a process—and that subjective experience of being someone emerges if a conscious information-processing system operates under a transparent self-model. You are such a system right now, as you read these sentences. Because you cannot recognize your self-model as a model, it is transparent: you look right through it. You don’t see it. But you see with it. In other, more metaphorical, words, the central claim of this book is that as you read these lines you constantly confuse yourself with the content of the self-model currently activated by your brain.”[ii]

This explains the research that increasingly is indicating the extraordinary extent to which seemingly conscious decisions have been made before subjects think they consciously made these decisions. This seems to indicate that many so-called conscious decisions are actually ­subconscious and our conscious awareness is only being informed of the decision.  It is not that consciousness has no meaningful role to play in a our behavior, but rather it seems to play a larger role the more reflection is reflected in any given behavior. For example its role in the choice to move to a different city, as opposed to realizing that you just scratched an itch, or the more we train ourselves in the daily practices of mindfulness.

Furthermore, these findings have interesting repercussions in the discussion of agency in general and in the context of freedom.[iv] It seems the true limits of our freedom are not external to our bodies,  as the determinism misperception implies, and therefore the autonomy of our human entity is not externally determined (only confined), but that it is consciousness itself that has been shown to be increasingly more limited than traditionally expected. We don’t have bodies, bodies have us.

Interestingly enough, the descriptions of many mystical experiences, are cast in terms of the abandonment of the “self.” I hypothesize that meditative practices, in witnessing the mind as an object, are stepping stones to a higher order consciousness, one that implicitly recognizes Metzinger’s scientific perspective. It might be more proper to say that mystical experiences are compatible with the self-model theory of consciousness, as indeed they would have to be if the model is any good. I do not want to suggest that Metzinger’s theory in any way implies universal consciousness or any other speculative metaphysics justified on experiential grounds. I speculate on the only way I could find universal consciousness rationally plausible elsewhere.

**EDIT:** I am not implying that there is no subjective experience, only stating that that experience is not identical to the system from which that experience arises, i.e. we are sloppy in our use of the term ""self.""",,False,,t5_2qh5b,True,,,True,t3_n2fpc,http://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/n2fpc/the_hard_problem_of_consciousness/,

Colour is a word we use to represent a concept. Time is a word we use to represent a concept.

Time and colour can't be used to describe each other. So the question becomes invalid and there is no possible answer.

Similarly, ""Meaning"" and ""Existence"" are concepts, so the question ""What is the meaning of existence?"" could just be another ""invalid"" question due to the mechanics of language.

We live in a world every bit as magical as Tolkien's or the Native American's. But through the sedimentation of language, the original naive-simplistic meaning is lost, and the word is fetishized into a life of its' own independent of any material meaning. 

Supposedly, according to Inwood in the Heidegger Dictionary, German is an ""original language"" like Ancient Greek and thus not corrupted by external influences like English is by Latin. People are not alienated from the simple everyday origins of sophisticated words. So glove is handshoe. Spengler's Decline of the West translates as Setting of the EveningLands. So according to pop-linguistics this is supposedly how German-speakers see the world. And one can easily see how it would lead to a metaphysical mindset.

From the Publisher:
The Atlas of True Names reveals the etymological roots, or original meanings,
of the familiar terms on today's maps of the World, Europe, the British Isles and the United States.

For instance, where you would normally expect to see the Sahara indicated,
the Atlas gives you ""The Tawny One"", derived from Arab. es-sahra “the fawn coloured, desert”.

The 'True Names' of 3000 cities, countries, rivers, oceans and mountain ranges
are displayed on these four fascinating maps,
each of which includes a comprehensive index of derivations.
Etymology, (OGr. etymon “true sense” and logos “speech, oration, discourse, word”)
is the study of the origin and history of words.

For the first time, the Atlas of True Names uses etymology to give us an unusual insight
into familiar geographical names – with intriguing results......

Once the names have been taken back to their roots and translated into English,
it is immediately apparent that our world has an extraordinary affinity with Middle-earth,
the mythical continent where the events of Tolkien’s ‘The Lord of the Rings’ are played out.

Middle-earth’s evocative “Midgewater”, “Dead Marshes” and “Mount Doom”
are strikingly similar in nature to Europe’s “Swirlwater”, “Darkford” or “Smoky Bay”,
as revealed by the Atlas of True Names.

Many geographical names are clearly rooted in Man’s observation of his natural environment;
the physical location of a settlement: “At the Foot of the Mountain” – Piedmont,
the character of an important water course: “The Gentle One” – The Seine
or even just the local vegetation: “Under the Oaks” – Potsdam.

Unsurprisingly, countries and landscapes
often derive their names from the characteristics
of the people who lived there: “Great Land of the Tattooed” – Great Britain,
whilst local mythology and regional rulers also frequently leave their legacy:
“Isle of the Monster’s Eye” – Peleponnese or “Illustrious Emperor” – Zaragoza.

Sometimes, it is impossible to deny the force of the Roman proverb
‘nomen est omen’.
For instance Grozny - the Chechnyan capital which,
over the last years, has been destroyed in so many wars,
– translates as “The Awesome”.

The Atlas of True Names restores an element of enchantment
to the world we all think we know so well.
It takes the reader on a journey into the unknown –
a unique exploration of uncharted territory
in that familiar place we all know as ‘home’.

Take a look at the world through fresh eyes!

1330799517.0,116,self.philosophy,qg4ok,What can I do with a philosophy degree?,151,35,219,http://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/qg4ok/what_can_i_do_with_a_philosophy_degree/,"So I'm currently in college and majoring in Psychology and Philosophy. When people hear that, they usually follow up with the question ""what are you planning on doing with that?"" It's a great question, because there are times when I have no idea.

I originally just wanted to study psychology and minor in philosophy, but my love for the subject grew and I determined that I wanted to devote my life to philosophy rather than psychology. At this point in time, I only continue to study psychology because it interests me on the level of a hobby, not as a career. I also figured it could benefit me in the future if philosophy doesn't work out.

Every day, however, I question just what I can do with my philosophy degree. My dream job is to be a professor. If you ask anyone that knows me, they will say I look, talk, and act like a professor. And that's perfect because it's what I want to do. That being said, I understand getting a job as a professor isn't all that easy. I assume I'll be having to get my doctorate, which is fine. But what will I do up to that point? Not only that, but the school I attend isn't nationally recognized for its philosophy program. It's not like I'm at Rutgers or Princeton or something. My school isn't a bad school, and in the region I'm in, it's pretty highly acclaimed. But I'm just worried for when I apply to graduate programs and such on my way to my doctorate that I won't be taken as seriously as someone who attended a school with a more notable philosophy program. And I feel like the program I get into, if that even happens, will have to be a pretty good one if I'm to get a job teaching, which can be a pretty difficult work area to excel in.

After school, I want to join a service organization like the Peace Corps JVC, or AmeriCorps, and do the 1-2 year commitment for that (depending on which one I join). It's something I think I would love doing (I try to be pretty involved in service and social justice), and I think it would help me out when applying for jobs and graduate programs, especially since some of those programs offer financial assistance for graduate programs. However, I'm not very confident at this time in my knowledge of philosophy. Granted, I'm only a sophomore in college and my grades are pretty good, but I feel like when I'm around other philosophy majors/professors, I come across as an idiot. My philosophical views are a little unusual (i.e. my stance on humanity, reason, morals, etc. are, what some would say, controversial), my knowledge of various philosophers and philosophies isn't at its best, and I just feel like I have a problem analyzing the texts we read. Philosophy for me isn't citing Hegel or Aristotle or Mill. It's just pure, open, stream-of-consciousness discussion. That's the part I love. The only problem is I feel like that's not good enough. And when I'm discussing a topic with other philosophy majors/professors (for instance, I attend a weekly philosophy discussion group at my school), I just get the feeling people don't take me seriously because I'm not very well-versed in regards to who believes what and why. To the average person with a limited education in philosophy, people think I'm good at it. But to the person with an education in philosophy, I get the feeling they think I'm an idiot, and I'm beginning to think that might be true. I mean in all the philosophy classes I've taken so far, I've gotten high B's to mid-A's. But I just don't know if that's good enough, especially if my college isn't that very well-known for its philosophy program.

Also, I have considered going to law school, but I just don't know if that would be right for me. Some tell me I'd make a good lawyer because I like to talk and discuss, some tell me it doesn't fit my personality.

So I guess I just want some advice and, if available, some motivating and uplifting comments as well. If you think I'm getting my degree in vain, feel free to say so. I can take the criticism. Just any comments at all will be heard and taken into account.

What happens when someone fails to construct meaning though? Suicide, while an option, is just a rejection of the question and the pursuit of constructing meaning in the first place.

The entire reason we form society is to bring order and protection to our existence. Protection of citizens is of the upmost importance because if citizens are not protected nothing else matters.

(reading included),136,28,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/1280v2/jeanpaul_sartres_ethical_critique_why_are_we/,"The reading begins on page 9 of [this text](http://philosophy.lander.edu/intro/articles/sartre-a.pdf) with the story of the student poised to face a tough decision.

This subreddit seems to focus a lot on ethics and ethical models, and how to act inside them.  There are two threads right now on ""justification"" and it seems like threads in that vein seem to come up every day or two.  That's not to say that they aren't good questions--they are--but always seem to run up against the limitations of ethical models that they are trying to operate from.  I was thinking about this mode of thinking a little bit over the last few days and had revisited Aristotle's Nichomachean Ethics a little while ago when I was reminded about a little story from Sartre that I read some time ago.  Within that little story up in the reading, the critique that he had really resonated within me. Particularly this bit: ""No rule of general morality can show you what you ought to do: no signs are vouchsafed in this world.""  Which isn't to say that all ethics are completely arbitrary, but that, as the reading continues to say, that me and my actions are the arbiter.  I believe that at its core, this is Aristotelian (especially related to Gadamer's relation to the element of application in *Truth and Method*), but that's besides the point.  The point rather is that I feel like Sartre is really getting at the heart of the matter: ethical models for tough decisions will consistently fail us.

The two examples--the student choosing between his dying mother and joining the resistance and the failed Jesuit--illustrate a wonderful point: that tough decisions are rife with context.  Thought experiments about pulling train levers only go so far.  The formulae of Kantian or Utilitarian ethics will never encapsulate the dynamism of the human experience.  JS Mill and Kant do have excellent treatises on their respective models, but it's the opinion of this author that they are unsatisfactory.  I don't want to escape into a rabbit hole of obscurantism but Sartre and Aristotle seem to pierce the issue entirely: it is in the event of the decision and action that ""ethicality"" lies.",,False,,t5_2qh5b,False,,,True,t3_1280v2,http://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/1280v2/jeanpaul_sartres_ethical_critique_why_are_we/,

If someone were to argue that people's beliefs are none of our business, consider the following:

Theist view their beliefs as a matter of life and death. Parents view their children's beliefs as potentially life changing. So what people believe can sometimes be important to fight for/against.

Throughout my philosophy education I often found myself accepting the positions that could conveniently be defended and rejecting the positions that could be easily argued against. Very rarely did I have to do any real constructive argumentation in favor of difficult or unpopular positions, and I find my skills in this department are quite weak as a result. Here's a little challenge to everyone in r/philosophy:

1. Go to [http://www.quotationspage.com/random.php3](http://www.quotationspage.com/random.php3)
2. Choose one of the random quotations (or if you want a real challenge, restrict yourself to the last).
3. Develop an argument (deductive, inductive, whatever) with that quotation as the conclusion.

Quick Example:

Quote (the last): ""That which has always been accepted by everyone, everywhere, is almost certain to be false."" Paul Valery (1871 - 1945)

Argument: Generally, the vast majority of once accepted propositions have been shown to be false. Specifically there is no obvious correlation between tradition, popularity, and geography of propositional acceptance and the truth of that proposition. Therefore, that which has always been accepted by everyone, everywhere is almost certain to be false.

I've been religious (christian) for most of my life, but I've been drifting away from it in recent years. This is my first post on Reddit ever. I'm pretty sure this is where it belongs. Although my reasons for thinking about this subject have to do with religion, the definition issue is one of philosophy.

So whenever I talk to christian friends of mine about free will being impossible and Gods judgement therefore unfair they will come up with this definition argument, leaving room for some limited form of free will. This seems kind of irrelevant to me.

The only kind of free will that to me would justify sending people to hell for not believing in God would be a 100% free one. Because if free will isn't 100% some people have an unfair advantage in the faith struggle. 

So this would be my definition: Being able to make decisions outside the influence of your upbringing, education, genes or even personality, chance and irrationality. 

But if we would have that, everyone would make the same rational decision in identical situations. Rational decisions would be the same over and over again, so they wouldn't be free. Also, an irrational decision could not be free. Irrational decisions are being influenced by your personality and other stuff, which you didn't pick. The third type of decision is made by chance, which is, quite self-explanatory, not free.

So to me it seems that the only useful definition of free will is inherently impossible. I don't understand why people make such a fuss about the definition, because it's so self explanatory to me that the definition I just gave is the only useful one.

So I was thinking this morning about how it is possible that there is something instead of nothing and if there could have been nothing and then something coming out of it. 

As I was thinking about the concept of nothingness, I thought that if there is nothing, then no laws apply to this nothingness, as there can't be any laws. Laws would be something. So the laws of thermodynamics (or at least the idea that you can't have something out of nothing) wouldn't apply to nothingness. So there would be no laws saying what can and what can't be. Thus it would be possible for the universe to just pop into existance from nothingness.

I'm not sure though if laws about the universe can be considered as something and if nothingness necessarily means the lack of universal laws.

A few words on lucid dreaming.,133,28,127,http://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/9alae/hi_science_a_few_words_on_lucid_dreaming/,"Tonight I took a melatonin pill to sleep better and went to bed. Half-way through the night I find myself awake behind my block. I felt a bit confused by figured I just sleep walked (although I haven't done so since being 7). I walked back to my house as I kept on thinking how on Earth I managed to pull it off. 

Suddenly I realize I'm standing at some unfamiliar house. I figured I was thinking so hard as to how I managed to get out of the house and not remember it, that I walked into somebody else's yard. As I looked around, however, I realize that I'm at my house back in home town (another continent). 

Now this is where I feel like I was following some shitty Prince of Bell Air article and realize it's a dream. I had a few lucid dreams already, so I stayed relaxed and walked back out of the yard. 

We had a large tree with berries on it near the entrance. As I looked at it, I could see each individual berry. I decided to pick a few. As I pulled on the first one, I was surprised at how realistic it felt. I picked a few and put them in my mouth. The taste was very much like a real thing.

I then walked down the street (at this point I'm completely at my hometown) looking at the fences, trees and the sky. Suddenly the sky started to become larger and larger (I've seen effect like that on crappy half-life 2 maps). I felt like I was loosing it and made an effort to concentrate. Everything went black. I woke up.

First thing I though to myself was how awesome that lucid dream was. Then I was thirsty, but to my surprise discovered the the cup with water wasn't beside my bed. I saw it on the table, stood up and walked to it. The watch showed 7:12. 'Weird' - I thought, but figured it's ok. I went to the window to see what 'seven o'clock' looks like.

It was sunset. Wtf. I was still dreaming. The sky was bright orange with individual clouds seen on the horizon and right above the window.

'Enough of this shit' - I thought, and went to bed like nothing was happening.

The strange thing about these experiences is that the reality I'm experiencing right now is very much like those dreams. The only exception is that it has better coherence and lasts indefinitely while I'm awake. I have a suspicion, which apparently is confirmed by what we know about the brain, that much of what we experience takes place in our head. The question is how much?

1330356175.0,104,self.philosophy,q85y3,"Pascal in ""The Rum Diary""",126,22,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/q85y3/pascal_in_the_rum_diary/,"Original Article: http://www.bywayofbeauty.com/2012/02/pascal-in-rum-diary.html

The Rum Diary is a a rollicking farce based on Hunter S. Thompson's novel of the same name written in the early 1960's. It focuses on a young American journalist named Paul Kemp who ventures into sweaty, inebriated San Juan, Puerto Rico to write for an ill-fated newspaper, and stumbles into the middle of a major land acquisition deal.

Thompson said that his ""long lost"" novel (which wasn't published until 1998) had ""a romantic notion,"" and that it was simply ""a good story."" I haven't read the book, but the same can be said about film adaptation with Johnny Depp. The sluggish car chases, drunken misadventures, drug-induced hallucinations, silky temptresses and bloody-eyed hangovers are more than enough to make you guffaw and forget your cares and worries - there is even an absurd diamond-encrusted turtle who makes a few guest appearances, and struck me as a perfectly insane image for this film. This is straight entertainment at its finest, no chaser.

But the diamond-crusted turtle also calls to mind a running theme of the film, a philosophical notion with its roots in 17th century philosopher Blaise Pascal.

At more than a few turns in the road, when the rum has run dry and the harsh clarity of sobriety is beginning to rush in, Kemp transcends the organized chaos of San Juan and begins to understand his true calling as a journalist: ""I put the bastards of this world on notice that I do not have their best interests at heart. I will try and speak for my reader.""


His mission to take down ""the bastards"" of the world is definitely fueled in part by his encounters with Sanderson, a sandy-haired real estate mogul played with deft obnoxiousness by Aaron Eckhart. Sanderson is ambitious, wealthy, self-centered. He encrusts a turtle with jewels because he got the idea ""from a book,"" while locals starve everywhere around him - and, despite Kemp's reservations, he is drawn into Sanderson's shady plan to fill a local island with a mega-resort. 

This narrative could be read in any number of ways - socially, economically, politically - but the most complete reading comes from a lobster. Or rather, Kemp on psychedelics looking at a lobster.


The trippy scene - which fans of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas will instantly recognize - ends with a wobbly, wild-eyed Kemp staring down a lobster in a tank. Kemp feels like this lobster is watching him and Sanderson and the rest of crazy San Juan, and can almost hear its thoughts: ""Human beings are the only creatures on earth that claim a God and the only living thing that behaves like it hasn't got one.""

This is an incredibly insightful and important statement - and deserves some exploration.

What Kemp (and really, Thompson) is getting at is a central paradox in Sanderson, Kemp, and all of humanity: that we tend to sing about, aspire to, and worship the divine, but practice, fall into, and embody the monstrous. Pick up any newspaper and you'll see two facts: as a species, we crave moral perfection, but we tend to be morally hideous.

This sets us apart from other animals - no other creature in this world prattles on about justice, wisdom, beauty, mercy, and love. But we're also not angels - we're constantly exploiting, torturing, hating, and waging war against others. As Dostoevsky put it in The Brothers Karamazov: ""People talk sometimes of a bestial cruelty, but that's a great injustice and insult to the beasts; a beast can never be so cruel as a man, so artistically cruel. The tiger only tears and gnaws, that's all he can do. He would never think of nailing people by the ears, even if he were able to do it.""


This notion of man as both a monstrous and magnificent creature, standing somewhere between angel and animal, takes its cue from philosopher Blaise Pascal. Although he contributed greatly to mathematics (""Pascal's triangle"") and physics (""Pascal's law""), he also did significant writing on matters of philosophy and theology - notably in his collection Pensées. 

In Pensées, Pascal writes of the paradox of man as both ""wretched"" and ""great"" - or, evil and noble, low-down and high-minded.

We are wretched because we are ""full of pride, ambition, lust, weakness, misery, and injustice."" Unlike other animals, we fall from moral ideals - not to moral neutrality, but to moral baseness - and the net result is unhappiness. As philosopher Peter Kreeft notes in his lengthy commentary on Pensées: ""Unhappiness is perhaps the most obvious and pervasive feature of experience. It was for Buddha...his very 'first noble truth' was that 'to live is to suffer; life is suffering [dukkha, out-of-joint-ness].' ""

But as Pascal writes, ""we are incapable of not desiring truth and happiness."" Kreeft explains: ""Truth (our head's food) and happiness (our heart's food) are the two things everyone wants, and not in crumbs but in great loaves; not in raindrops but in waves. Yet these are the two things no one gets except in little crumbs and droplets.""

From our sink-hole of unhappiness, we cry out for and search for something - not a little relief here and there, but perfect truth and goodness. None of us have it, and we all want it. More often than not, this has manifested - a truth that is anthropological before being religious - in a cry for God.


Kemp in The Rum Diary seems to carry on Pascal's tradition - he notes that man is distinct in both his ""greatness"" and ""wretchedness,"" in his godly talk and his ungodly actions. This is a powerful insight - one that all of the data and experience in the world supports. But what does it mean?

First, it might mean that, as Kreeft notes, ""man is a living oxymoron: wretched greatness, great wretchedness, rational animal, mortal spirit, thinking reed."" Or, in Pascal's words: ""What sort of freak then is man! How novel, how monstrous, how chaotic, how paradoxical, how prodigious! Judge of all things, feeble earthworm, repository of truth, sink of doubt and error, the glory and refuse of the universe!""

It might mean that our temptations toward seeing man as a divine spirit or ""angelic"" (certain Christian denominations, Eastern religions, and philosophies) or as a mere animal (materialism) miss the mark on what sort of creature man is. As Pascal writes, ""man is neither angel nor beast,"" yet both.

And most importantly, it might mean that our doubleness, our paradoxical nature, suggests that humanity, like Humpty Dumpty, has suffered some kind of great fall, some catastrophe. We're broken, screwed up, deracinated, unstable - but we know or ""remember"" something higher to climb to, to long for, something perfect that's nowhere to be seen in the world, but that lingers in our collective memory.

To make clear my sentiments, I'll set up an example scenario:

Let's say that only my mind does exist. Everything, everyone, all of history would then have been the work of my very imagination. That being the case, the people I encounter in my daily life are, too, products of my mind. When I go to class though, I experience the sensation of learning.

My interpretation may be flawed, but under the precepts of solipsism would the things I learn from others actually be tidbits that my mind already possesses but simply bars from my conscious self?",,False,,t5_2qh5b,False,,,True,t3_1a9knw,http://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/1a9knw/solipsism/,

Well worth a listen.


EDIT: Some people are saying this does not belong here, and I understand that he doesn't touch on a specific philosophy/philosopher but his views and thoughts on how to think are profoundly philosophical. I wasn't meaning for this to come off as some sort of lesson, more as food for thought or a way to think about philosophy as it pertains to everyday life. I'm sorry if I put it in the wrong place. 

Thanks to dwaxe however, we have a full length video with the full text (which may be easier to understand) and no horrible ending music. Thanks dwaxe!

I'm writing a paper that hits on the topic of brainwashing at one point. For my purposes, it is less important what the answer is than what considerations people think are relevant. Also, I'm undecided, so I'm not going to offer my answer.

e: A lot of you are asking me to define ""brainwashing"". This is good advice for a first-year student, but I've got my degree already. Part of what I'm trying to do is develop an analysis of brainwashing. To that end, you amass examples and counterexamples and try to figure out what they have in common. Looking at the debates on free will, for example, good arguments don't start out with a definition of free will; you work your way up to that point.",,False,,t5_2qh5b,1341205574.0,,,True,t3_vuyrz,http://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/vuyrz/is_religious_education_brainwashing/,
