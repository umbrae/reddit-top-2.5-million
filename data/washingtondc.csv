They didn't take much except for my book bag. Most everything in the bag is replaceable except for a pair of my late grandfather's WWII dog tags. They are worthless to anyone else but are obviously priceless to me. I know it's a long shot, but crazier miracles have happened here on Reddit. If any of you who are reading this live around there or find yourself in that area today, and you happen to find a green/black/gray Eddie Bauer book bag in a trashcan, behind a bush, in a dumpster, in the gutter, etc. or you just happen to find some old looking dog tags, could you please contact me via PM? I would also like you to upvote this post for visibility. Like I said, I know this is a long shot, but I can't just sit back and not try.

I'm a black woman living in Columbia Heights.

One of the things I love about living in DC is the diversity. We're lucky to be living in a city with such a diverse cultural makeup. I lived in San Francisco for the summer and I yearend for the ethnic and cultural tapestry that is DC. 

I get that not everyone living in DC has embraces DC's diversity like I do and that's fine. Diversity isn't everyone's thing. However, there is a big difference between not embracing diversity and just being a casual racist. 

As much as I love this subreddit (and I really really love this subreddit) the casual racism here genuinely makes me sad. It makes it difficult to freely peruse this subreddit the way I wish I could. There are posts on here that I KNOW will have a lot of racism in the comments. I always tell myself not to look at the comments, but I always do.  It disappoints me--I know this subreddit is better than that. 

 Maybe some people think of r/washingtondc as a kind of all-white ""safe space.""  Maybe they think it's a place where you can air your casual racism and have it be okay. I just want you guys to know that just like in DC, there are people of color in this subreddit. We're here, too. 

I see a lot of casual racism here and it always hurts. I absolutely love talking race and our racial differences, but can't we do so without being cruel to each other? Can't we stay civil? Can't we keep it about ideas and arguments and not about attacking entire groups of people?

 I guess [this](http://i.imgur.com/TTidb.jpg) post today broke the camel's back, so to speak. But there are many other examples. This isn't just a few rouge trolls saying racist stuff. This person is obviously entitled to his/her opinion, but this isn't an idea or an argument or a discussion starter--this is just insulting. How are you supposed to reason with this? How does this keep the conversation going? 

Let's learn about/from each other and have open conversations about our racial differences, attitudes, frustrations, hangups, and misconceptions. But let's try to keep it civil. 

**tl;dr** Say what you need to say, just don't be a dick about it.

I am in need of a flash mob. I am a chairperson for Stillbrave which is a childhood cancer foundation for the DC/MD/VA area. We have a little girl who was just recently diagnosed with brain cancer that we are helping. We provide non-medical assistance to families that are dealing with this crappy thing called cancer. Well...this little girl hasn't been doing so well. She's lost her appetite (which is fairly normal with chemotherapy) and is having a hard time right now. Tara's dream has always been to be a princess. So we are making that dream come true. We have reserved a horse drawn carriage for Friday May 3rd. Tara's mom is having a princess tea party for her and her friends. Our director, Tom, is dressing up as Prince Charming. He will go to her house, put a glass slipper on her little foot and then take her and her friends for a carriage ride.

Now here is where you can come in and help. We want to make her feel like the most special princess there is. So we want to get a large flash mob of people lining the main street the carriage is going to take holding up ""Princess Tara"" signs and cheering her on.

I mean...who wouldn't want to be a part of making this little girl smile? We want this to be big! We want people cheering and yelling and just going nuts for this little girl. She needs a pick me up so she can fight this horrible disease and go on to have many more of her dreams come true. So who's with me? All it will take is a little bit of your time and enthusiasm.

We'd like to keep this hush hush so it's a real surprise for Tara.

Here are the details:  

When:  Friday, May 3, 2013 

Time:  Lining up around 6pm…we’ll be picking Tara up around 6:30pm
Where:  Start lining up at Brandy Station &amp; Stringfellow Rd. (they won’t be able to see us from their house)

Who:  ANYONE!  Everyone!  Bring your kids, bring your pets, bring whomever wants to make a little girl smile.  And bonus points to anyone who makes signs &amp; decorates them with “Princess Tara” and princess type stuff.

If anyone would like more details or to help please feel free to contact me at: donations@stillbrave.org

Also check out our site to get more details about what we are doing: www.stillbrave.org

Thank you all....I've read so many stories about Reddit users coming out to help people like this and I hope I'm proved right about how awesome you guys are :)

Kel

edit:  Street name has been corrected from Brand to Brandy.  Sorry!  


***UPDATE 5-1-13***
Okay I've talked with Tom (Stillbrave's director) and have a little more info.  Tara's mom will be bringing her home at 5:30pm.  So to avoid the possibility of them seeing a large crowd out there we are asking that everyone meet up at the Brandy Station &amp; Stringfellow intersection closest to Rt. 50.  We want to keep people off of Stringfellow any closer to their until we hear that they've made it home.  At that point us Stillbrave members &amp; volunteers will get you all in position.  So we can go from from that intersection back towards Rt. 50 and we should be fine.  We can also have people line up on Brandy Station on the far side.  Don't worry...we will be in Stillbrave TShirts so you all will recognize us.  If you're not sure where to go just find one of us and we'll direct you to the right area.

We do not know what route the carriage will take yet...it'll depend on the crowd.  

***********************************

**UPDATE 4-26-13:  Parking...I've spoken with a resident who lives in that area and there is ample street parking for normal use.  This event might go beyond the normal use spectrum.  So here are the options:  There is a pool on Stringfellow for the community that has a parking lot.  I'd use that if you have really small kids, the elderly or any handicapped participants.  For all others the best bet would probably be to park in Greenbriar Shopping Center on Rt. 50.  It's about a 1 mile walk from there to Brandy Station &amp; Stringfellow.  A fairly easy walk for most of us.  

Both corners of Brandy Station &amp; Stringfellow will be the staging areas.  Stillbrave members &amp; volunteers will be on hand to get you in position.

Lastly (for today at least) are there any videographers out there willing to donate their time to come out and record this for Tara?  We'd like to be able to give her a DVD of it that she can watch anytime she's feeling down &amp; needs a pick me up.  Please contact me at:  donations@stillbrave.org if you are interested in donating your time for this.

(details inside)",235,36,139,http://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/tq3vf/rdc_i_want_to_clean_up_the_dc_cab_industry_and_i/,"Hello! I'm Daniel, and I recently became a lawyer here in DC after graduating from Georgetown Law. (Feel free to AMA about DC law law school, or starting a law practice.)

I'm sure most of you have seen the articles about corruption and ineffectiveness at the DC Taxicab commission. DC cabs regularly violate the rules and get away with it...and most of you have probably seen it in person. For example, it's illegal to:

* Ask you where you are going before they let you in
* Refuse to take you anywhere within the District
* For a dispatcher to even ask you where you are going before they send a cab
* Refuse to turn off the radio

I want to do something about this, because DC hasn't and won't. The good news for all of us that DC has really good consumer-protection laws. The law provides for $1500 per violation, plus the possibility of punitive damages if they're really big jerks. The good news for me is that the law also provides for attorneys fees and costs.

So, if you want to do your part help the Taxicab Commission's do the job that they refuse to do, it's pretty easy. Next time a cab or dispatcher does something shady like refuse to take you somewhere, overcharge you, whatever, write down the taxicab company's name and any other info you can get (ideally, the taxi number, driver's name and license plate.) Even better, record the whole thing on your cell phone. (DON'T RECORD IT SECRETLY IF YOU'RE IN MARYLAND.) Then PM me or email me (inquiries at taloslaw.com) and we'll see if we can go after them.

No one is going to get rich doing it, but it won't cost you a cent (I'll front the costs, and if we lose, I'll eat them. And if we win, I'll get them from the court). And you could get $1500 for your time, which is pretty sweet. And most importantly, if we do a few of these and word gets around that the law is actually getting enforced, it'll start sucking a lot less to take a cab in this city.

Thanks! And again, feel free to AMA.

You basically rode cover for me for the entire stretch until we parted ways. This was a conscious decision on your part to protect a rider.

From the headlights and body, you appeared to be driving a Ford Econoline van, probably a work vehicle. You were probably on your way home from work, as was I. I was in a black jacket on a gold bike with a tail bag.

Either you ride, you have family that rides, or you're just the politest driver I've seen on the roads in years. If you're out there, I'd like to buy you a beer. Serious offer. I intended to pull alongside you and say thanks, but we got separated.

It's Spring, and we beekeepers are really glad of it because it has been a BAD winter for bees nationwide. Many of us have lost many hives, so we could really use your help if you see a swarm of bees which we could catch and give a safe place to live.

If you see a swarm of bees, or even think you might, please call me at (202) 255 4318 or email dcbees@... and we can get an experienced beekeeper over there quick to help you out. Insecticides truly will not take care of your situation, but we can.

If you watch the news, you will probably soon hear about record losses of bees nationwide. We think all sorts of things factor into it, including climate change, monocultural agriculture (with attendant pesticides), a resurgent pest population, and a difficult summer last year. Many of us have lost our bees, too, even though we are trying to build naturally resistent colonies and treat our bees as treasures, not commodities.

Please remember: honeybees are under extreme threat, and those swarms represent the unique populations that have not only figured out how to survive pests, pesticides, and climate change, but THRIVE. We beekeepers can grab those bees, give them safe homes somewhere else, and help ensure a healthier future where honeybees can continue to make our food supply and green spaces grow. It is a kind of compliment to DC that we have a place where honeybees and people can collaborate so well. ""

Thanks again to everyone who came out last night. The only thing that broke was my toilet seat. Let the jokes begin. I have all the photos on my computer, but some people have asked to be excluded. I need to head out for h-street, but hopefully I can get that straightened out tomorrow. If you're in the area, give me a ring.

Also, add me on facebook www.facebook.com/bryan.casler ^_^

Lastly, if you're in the mood for supporting a good cause. Go check out a fellow redditor who is DJ'ing the [Fourth Annual Bike House Extravaganza!](http://thebikehouse.org/2012/09/04/fourth-annual-bike-house-extravaganza/)

* What? The 4th Annual Bike House Fundraiser Party
* Where? BHPD, 1232 Euclid St, NW #2, Washington DC
* When? September 15, 8:00pm-2:00am
* Why? Because your $10 helps us help fix bikes!

**UPADTE 1: PARTY WRAP UP:**

Thanks everyone who came out tonight. We probably had ~100 people show up and not a single problem. DC Reddit is good peeps. The party started at 8:23 and the last people just left at 2:52. Not too shabby. Tomorrow I will post pictures and videos for everyone to check out. There were so many wonderfully people who came out tonight, I look forward to hearing from many of you. Can't wait to hangout again. ~Scratch

P.S. If anyone is wondering, we went through five garbage bags of cans and bottles.

**ORIGINAL POST**

My roommate is gone for two weeks and it's time to break in my new apartment. I made a [post earlier today](http://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/zvqhh/new_to_the_area_and_my_roommate_is_gone_for_two/) and several folks wanted to do a house party tonight.

If you show up, you need to bring something to share. Preferably beer or snacks. There are countless liquor and beer stores, plus a Harris Teater, all within two blocks of my place. I have everything to make Pina Coladas except Rum. Can someone bring that?

The party starts at 8 and goes to whenever (the later the better). I have space for crashing if it's needed. But tomorrow I am leaving at noon-ish for the h-street festival.

* Who can bring **~~Cards against humanity?~~**
* Who can bring **~~Beer Pong Balls?~~**

If you can't make it, but want to help out. Please upvote so that someone who's ""forever alone"" tonight doesn't miss this.

* Host: Bryan
* Number: 520 302 4829

* Address: [2301 champlain st nw](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=2301+Champlain+St+NW,+Washington,+DC)

* For the green/yellow line, get off at Columbia Heights

We stopped by the Holocaust museum, did a 3-hour segway tour of the mall area, and then had a pizza at Matchbox dowtown (fucking delicious).  On Monday, we checked out the Air and Space museum and then rode Bikeshare bikes (such a cool setup) up to 7th and K and got a So-Good from the Tops food truck (amazing).  We then went to the Natural History museum (their gems and minerals exhibit is crazy), today checked out the Dulles airport Air and Space museum branch, and stopped by the Flight 93 memorial on the way home.

My fiancée and I went to a couple of the art museums in the morning, then used the bike share (this is awesome) to ride around the river and see some of the monuments.  Next, we went to Ben's Chili Bowl for lunch.  

After a trip back to the hotel for a nap, we got ready for Dinner and ate at the Old Ebbitt Grill.  Then we headed to see some of the memorials at night.  I proposed at the D.C. War Memorial, here are a couple of pictures: [http://imgur.com/a/5kOma](http://imgur.com/a/5kOma)

We spent another fifteen minutes or so taking pictures, then sat and talked before the night ended.

It went wonderfully for both of us, and just wanted to thank you all again for the help, it made the proposal and our whole vacation better.  Also, thanks to www.cerissaphotography.com for meeting us in the cold and taking pictures.

To the two good Samaritans,

Thank you for helping me tonight on 18th st. in Adams Morgan. My good friend was being accosted by two ""Marines."" She was too intoxicated to take care of herself, and was being stalked by two guys. I was worried, particularly after one of them confronted me, asking why I was ""following them."" He tried to explain that ""she totally wanted it,"" even though she was clearly trying to get away from the two guys groping her. I grabbed the two nearest guys, both of whom were pretty large African American dudes, and asked them for help. They helped me confront the ""Marines"" (I use that term very loosely), and together we scared them away. After finding a police officer, the officer helped get my friend into a cab, and both of the skeezers disappeared into the night. I'm sure you good samaritans will never see this, but please know that I really am thankful for the help that you two random strangers gave me and my friend tonight.

Best,

Person(s) in need of help


Edit: Hey everyone. Sorry for the dramatic nature of that post, and sorry it has a white-knight kind of vibe.

I was going to delete the post, but decided it would be better to leave it up so people could talk about how to handle such situations. My friend was acquainted with one of the guys who was being inappropriate, so at the time I thought it wouldn't be a good idea to get the police involved. In retrospect, maybe finding an officer should have been the first thing I did. God knows there are enough of them in Adams Morgan at night.

As for how I identified both the creepers and the good samaritans, I apologize. I referred to them as Marines because that was the only identifying feature I knew about them. Before the problem arose, I heard them talking about the Marines, so that's how I identified them in my head. I probably should have just left that out.

As for the race of the guys who helped out, I clearly touched a nerve with one poster. Yeah, they were black, but I guess it really doesn't matter. I just wanted to express my thanks.",,False,,t5_2qi2g,1374941492.0,,,True,t3_1j5go7,http://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/1j5go7/thank_you/,

Today, I cycled 21 miles from one end of Washington DC to the other.",153,24,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/j09dz/10_years_ago_today_i_hit_a_tree_on_a_dirtbike_at/,"Sorry if this is not 100% DC related.

To give you the long and short of it, when I was 13 years old, my dirtbike malfunctioned and sent me into a group of trees at about 70mph. In the initial accident, I shattered an inch of my right femur, broke five ribs, chipped my collar bone, cracked my shoulder blade, collapsed a lung and broke my hip in two places. 

After my Mother, who happens to be a Physical Therapist who specializes in hips and works with the doctors on call that night, convinced them not to amputate my leg they decided to try a new type of external fixiter on my leg to save it. Fortunately it worked, but in the process of taking it off, they accidentally snapped my knee cap in half forcing me to go back in for another surgery to repair that. After over a year of Physical Therapy, I was left with a knee that will only bend to about 90 degrees for the rest of my life.

Several years after the accident, we found out that my hip, which was broken in two places in the accident, had not healed properly and was essentially a dead bone that would have to be replaced. After putting the surgery off just long enough for me to finish college, I had it replaced last September only to find out a few months later that they have started recalling hip replacements like it is their job. 

So here I am 11 months after that hip replacement living in DC as a 23yr old with the joints of a 73yr old and I decided to celebrate my physical freedom with a nice bike ride up Mt Vernon Trail and through Rock Creek Park.

There are many many more elements to this story (failed blood transfusions, a parametic who nearly killed me, a shattered helmet, etc) but in the name of keeping this as brief as possible, I'll end it here.

I used to live in the NoVA area and as a child of the 80s I took breakdancing lessons after ballet (yes, go ahead, laugh, take your time, I'll still be here.  :-)  I had an instructor that I only knew of by the name California, and he was with the breakdancing troupes the DC Breakers and the GQ Poppers.

My mother was a professional artist who passed peacefully in her sleep about 1.5 years ago.  Here is her obituary:

http://hosting-24290.tributes.com/show/Simone-Warren-91422388

I have almost 200 pieces of her works.  She created a HUGE portrait of California (we're talking about 4ft by 4ft - my mother was of the ""go big or go home"" variety) and while I think it's one of her best paintings, I would prefer to give it to the person who would probably love to have it.  Here is an Imgur album I made of the painting and two photos showing California (I am the little blonde girl in the red outfit.)

http://imgur.com/a/SGBrv#0

Please note that the picture we took of the painting doesn't do the work justice - the camera flash bounced off the painting in a weird way.  

I called the Russell School of Ballet's original owners, but they don't have his information anymore (it was almost 30 years ago.)  I've tried various Google searches and contacted a person via YouTube who told me he's ""somewhere in the DC area"" and that California was also part of the ""GQ Poppers"", but they didn't know his real name either and they hadn't seen him in awhile. I tried contacting someone else who I thought was also part of the DC Breakers, but I didn't get a response out of him either.  I've tried posting to Craigslist Missed Connections, but did not receive a response.  Not sure where else to go at this point.

If anyone knows California, knows of him, or may know an old school DC Breaker / GQ Popper and can help me get in touch with California, I would greatly appreciate it.  You can privately message me if that's preferred!

DCMR

1201	SAFE OPERATION OF BICYCLES, AND MOTORIZED BICYCLES

1201.1	Every person who propels a vehicle by human power or rides a bicycle on a highway shall have the same duties as any other vehicle operator under this title, except as otherwise expressly provided in this chapter, and except for those duties imposed by this title which, by their nature or wording, can have no reasonable application to a bicycle operator.

1201.2	A person shall operate a bicycle, sidewalk bicycle or personal mobility device in a safe and non-hazardous manner so as not to endanger himself or herself or any other person.

1201.3	(a)	A person operating a bicycle may overtake and pass another vehicle only under conditions which permit the movement to be made with safety. 

(b)	A person operating a bicycle may overtake and pass other vehicles on the left or right side, staying in the same lane as the overtaken vehicle, or changing to a different lane, or riding off the roadway, as necessary to pass with safety.

(c)	If a lane is partially occupied by vehicles that are stopped, standing, or parked in that lane, a person operating a bicycle may ride in that or in the next adjacent lane used by vehicles proceedings in the same direction.

1201.4	No person shall operate or ride a bicycle other than upon or astride a regular seat attached to the bicycle.

1201.5	No person shall operate or ride on a bicycle with more persons on it at any one time than the bicycle is equipped to carry.

1201.6	No person shall operate or ride a bicycle while carrying any package, bundle, or article which prevents the operator from keeping at least one hand on the handle bars.

1201.7	Persons riding upon a roadway shall not ride more than two abreast except on paths or part of roadways set aside for the exclusive use of bicycles. Persons riding two abreast shall not impede the normal and reasonable movement of traffic and, on a lane roadway, shall ride within a single lane.

1201.8	No person shall operate a bicycle at a speed in excess of any posted limit or at a speed which is greater than is reasonable and prudent under the conditions then existing.

1201.9	There shall be no prohibition against any person riding a bicycle or personal mobility device upon a sidewalk within the District, so long as the rider does not create a hazard; provided, that no person shall ride a bicycle or operate a personal mobility device upon a sidewalk within the Central Business District except on those sidewalks expressly designated by Order of the Mayor, nor shall any person ride a bicycle upon a sidewalk in any area outside of the Central Business District if it is expressly prohibited by Order of the Mayor and appropriate signs to such effect are posted.

1201.10	Any person riding a bicycle or personal mobility device upon a sidewalk shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians, and shall travel at a speed no greater than the posted speed limit of the adjacent roadway; provided, that such speed is safe for the conditions then existing on the sidewalk.

1201.11	A person propelling a bicycle or operating a personal mobility device upon and along a sidewalk or while crossing a roadway in a crosswalk shall have all the rights and duties applicable to a pedestrian under the same circumstances, except that the bicyclist or personal mobility device operator must yield to pedestrians on the sidewalk or crosswalk.

1201.12	The operator of a bicycle or personal mobility device emerging from, or entering an alley, driveway, or building, shall upon approaching a sidewalk, or the sidewalk area extending across any alleyway, yield the right-of-way to all pedestrians approaching on said sidewalk, and upon entering the roadway shall yield the right-of-way to all vehicles approaching on said roadway, to the extent necessary to safely enter the flow of traffic.

1201.13	No bicyclist shall suddenly leave a sidewalk and ride into the path of a vehicle which is so close that it is impossible for the driver to yield.

1201.14	No person operating a bicycle shall sound any warning device at any intersection so as to interfere with the obedience to the instructions of official traffic control signals or to the directions of police traffic control officers.

1201.15	No person shall operate a bicycle except in obedience to the instructions of official traffic control signals, signs, and other control devices applicable to vehicles, unless otherwise directed by a police officer or other person authorized to direct and control traffic.

1201.16	No person riding upon a bicycle shall attach himself or herself or the device upon which he or she is riding to any vehicle upon a highway, roadway, or in an alley.

1201.17	All provisions of this section shall be equally applicable to the operation and riding of motorized bicycles, except as specifically provided in this chapter; provided, that nothing in this chapter shall be construed as to limit the applicability of Chapters 1, 4, 5, 6, and 7 with respect to the licensing, registration, inspection, or equipment of motorized bicycles or motorcycles.

1201.18	Except as otherwise permitted for a motor vehicle, no person shall operate a motorized bicycle on any sidewalk or any off-street bikepath or bicycle route within the District. This prohibition shall apply even though the motorized bicycle is being operated solely by human power.

1374547911.0,103,self.washingtondc,1iuxvv,Remember the flipped car on Pennsylvania Avenue? We would love some help,118,15,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/1iuxvv/remember_the_flipped_car_on_pennsylvania_avenue/,"My sister and I are both from DC and have lived here (in DC proper) our entire lives and we would love some help.

A couple of days ago there was a picture of an overturned car on Pennsylvania Avenue (post: http://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/1ikmz3/this_just_happened_at_22nd_and_penn_in_foggy/ imgur: http://i.imgur.com/9gUbFUX.jpg). My sister was the driver. She is okay, not even a concussion or anything and she remembers the whole thing. We are looking for any information/pictures that anybody has of what happened/the aftermath. There were a TON of people that watched or responded so I'm guessing that some took pictures and some are (hopefully) redditors. /u/Asquared1205 was kind enough to email me the rest of his pictures.

We have questions because there are some weird things going on. My sister and the passenger were working and on their way from one location to another of the company. She drives this route all the time. She was driving north-west on Pennsylvania when she heard/felt a hit from the back right. Next thing she knew they were flipping and she was screaming. They came to rest and miraculously both she and the passenger were fine. They had to hang there sideways for half an hour until the firemen got them out and took them to the hospital. 

Here's where the weird stuff begins. Both my sister and the passenger were completely coherent as they got to the hospital, scratches were their worst injuries. In the hospital, my sister was checked in under her own name but the other passenger (who is hispanic and speaks decent but not perfect English) was never even asked his name. He was checked in under ""Trauma"" something. This meant that we couldn't find him for another half hour. Then the police came to talk to my sister and told her that two witnesses said she had been ""whipping a fast u-turn"" and flipped over and then hit another car as she was flipping. Both she and the passenger assert that they were definitely not trying to do a u-turn and they both remember the first hit. Then we realized from the pictures that the front of the car is facing the wrong way for it to have happened because of a u turn, as they were traveling north-west (look at the picture and you'll see that the front of the car is pointed towards the right, if they had been doing a u turn going NW, it would be towards the left). Today, a police officer stopped by our home and told my sister that his report said that she had been traveling south-east, which is definitely not true.

I understand that a lot of this stuff could be just how the police/firemen/EMTs/hospitals typically work, but it just seems so strange that they are telling us this story that is so far from the truth. We're just looking for any information that anybody has. For example, did anybody actually see a car trying to do a u-turn or was that just a rumor that maybe somebody speculated and then spread throughout the (large) crowd? Does anybody have any information about a third car? Do you have any pictures? Anything at all would be appreciated. 

TL;DR Wear a seatbelt, it'll save your life. Also we would appreciate information on this crash if you have it, PM me.

Edit: Took out stuff about hospital because of HIPAA, thank you to everybody giving advice/sending PMs with pics! I really really appreciate it!!",,False,,t5_2qi2g,1374588554.0,,,True,t3_1iuxvv,http://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/1iuxvv/remember_the_flipped_car_on_pennsylvania_avenue/,

I walk around the city every day and see people locking up their bikes in very careless fashions. I figured I'd post some tips about how to properly secure one's bike. Feel free to add whatever you think would help!

1) GET A PROPER LOCK. GET A PROPER LOCK. GET A PROPER LOCK. Don't use a cable lock. Those are crazy easy to snip through with a pair of wire cutters. What you want is a nice thick chain or a u-lock. My preference is for kyptonite locks. yes, they are more expensive, but if you get one of their upper-end locks, you're pretty much set. you need the jaws of life to pry off one of these fuckers, and kryptonite will buy you a new bike if you can prove that it was the lock (and not WHAT you locked up to) that failed. kryptonite locks are also for life: they'll replace any lock that stops working. you can buy them in most reputable bike shops, or online at https://www.kryptonitelock.com


2) ONLY LOCK UP TO SECURE THINGS. do not lock up to trees. if you have a nice enough bike, expect someone to cut down that tree for your bike. do not lock up to street signs. street signs are attached with simple bolts, it's pretty easy to take off the actual sign and lift your bike, lock and all, right off the post. same with most construction scaffolding: if it has bolts, it can be unbolted. do not lock up to the chain part of chain link fences. wire cutters make short work of chain link fences. do not lock up to bike racks without first making sure they are secured to something. do not lock up to parking meters without first making sure your lock cannot be slipped off of it (not so much a problem with u-lock, but definitely a problem with chains). do not lock up to other bikes. do not lock up to things that say ""do not lock your bike here"". do not lock up to anything by putting your lock JUST through your tire--it's not terribly hard to take that tire off for most bike thieves.

3) SPEAKING OF TIRES. It's not a bad idea to invest in a second lock (this CAN be a cable lock) to secure your front tire to your bike, so no one steals it. Or, you can invest in secure bolts. I have pinhead component (http://www.pinheadcomponents.com/) bolts on my tires, seat, and handlebars. They discourage the casual hoodlum, although someone with a bunch of keys could probably find a way to steal your tire if they were really dedicated--the keys aren't all 100% individual.

4) DON'T LEAVE YOUR BIKE UNATTENDED FOR TOO LONG. I keep my bike in my bedroom, because I don't like leaving it out all night. Sometimes I do, but I try to avoid it. In general, do not leave your bike locked to the same thing for more than a day or two. Bikes left lying around attract thieves.

5) Put the lock through the frame of the bike. Thieves can take off handlebars and tires.

6) If it can be removed, it will be removed. This means tires, handlebars, reflectors, lights, etc etc etc. Anti-theft bolts help, removing lights when you lock your bike helps, not leaving your bike in one place too long helps, and being careful where you park it helps, but no one thing is going to make your bike completely safe so always be wary.

Edit: Things that other people have added

1) Get a lock for your back tire if it's quick release. 

2) Commute using CaBi, only use your personal bike for pleasure

3) Keep a beater bike for rainy nights/if you're going to be out late, so your nice bike isn't at risk

4) All bike locks can be broken, you want to minimize the risk of theft but it's always there so be careful where you leave your bike and for how long.",,False,,t5_2qi2g,1363084904.0,,,True,t3_1a3tf2,http://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/1a3tf2/psa_for_people_who_do_not_want_to_get_their_bike/,

One particular bike, maybe a Cannondale, had a huge bag draped on the back and the kid went for something.  I yelled at him to stop and he immediately stepped away.  We yelled back and forth a bit, and he brought his chubby friend to try and intimidate me (I'm 6'3"", 220), but I think I scared them off.  I told the bus driver, and he told the cops parked near Adams Morgan and the police headed that direction.  I am not confident he won't try again later tonight, so if you notice something missing from your bike, or your bike is missing, PM me and I would be happy to help you file a description of the kid.  Bonus Fact: While yelling at me, he said, ""you are not my father.""  If I had been thinking quicker I would have asked for his father's phone number, but instead just said, ""I don't have to be your dad to tell you that you don't steal from people.""

Thanks again for a [wonderful party](http://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/zvzwf/house_party_tonight_friday_starting_8pm_in_adams/) last Friday. The only thing that got broken was my toilet seat, but it was already half busted. The party lasted just under **seven hours** and we had roughly **~75-100 people** show up. Twice we filled up the entire fridge with beer, and that doesn't count all the liquor and champaign people brought.

Before anyone asks, I'm not 100%  sure when the next party will be, but I'm thinking next Friday. If you can't wait that long, come join me tonight to watch the series premier of ""[Survivor Man Ten Days](http://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/zvzwf/house_party_tonight_friday_starting_8pm_in_adams/)""

Lastly, there is one thing that needs to be examined. Every time a woman walked into the party, several people cheered ""Another girl! ... you are number seven!"". Maybe while this is funny to some it is also offensive as it tokenizes the women who attended. This is not the atmosphere I want at my parties. Lets learn from this and make the next one even better!

Within about a minute I received a call from Ahmed informing me that he would be there in under five minutes, and suggesting I walk to a nearby intersection so it would be easier for me to be picked up (I was on a one-way street and he would have had to go around the block).  He picked me up in a fantastically clean black Mercedes with a copy of the day's Washington Post.

After giving me a very friendly greeting, he told me how the service worked.  There is a time and per mile charge, just like a cab, with a minimum fare of $15.  I knew all this from their site, but it was nice to know.  I gave Ahmed my address and he punched it into his in-dash GPS, then asked if I had a preferred route, and we were on our way.

We made some chit-chat and I read, and about 20 minutes after I got into the car we arrived at my house.  I thanks Ahmed and got out.  No cash, they charged my card.

Later that evening I received an email receipt which included a map of our trip, the total distance traveled, and the cost, along with other information.

Overall, I was very satisfied with the service.  It took 17 minutes to go 3.56 miles at an average speed of 12.36 mph - can you even imagine knowing that information from a cab ride?  It felt luxurious.  The total cost was $22.  A cab ride during rush hour, with the surcharges and tip, would have been $18-$20.  For the convenience and service, the extra $2 was more than worth it.

If you haven't tried Über yet, give it a short.

Photos here: http://www.jdland.com/dc/quickgallery.cfm?qd=121116-3

I went opening night. The park's been super busy all weekend, which is pretty rare for the neighborhood outside of baseball games. Skating was really fun and the park is gorgeous, though the rink gets crowded sometimes during the thinner parts of the track due to the unique figure 8 configuration.

Lot 38 Espresso ( http://www.yelp.com/biz/lot-38-espresso-bar-washington) faces the park and has amazing coffee and hot chocolate. Ignore the Starbucks on M also facing the park.

The bar/restaurant at the Park isn't open yet, should be within a month. In the meanwhile, heading to the new Krubai Thai restaurant behind the DOT at 3rd and M a few blocks away makes it a perfect date combo! ( http://www.dailycandy.com/washington-dc/listing/138444/Kruba-Thai-Sushi ) It's a few bucks more expensive than your average DC Thai fare, but also tastes better. http://www.yelp.com/biz/kruba-thai-and-sushi-washington

I've lost my grandfather's watch. I went out last night and had a few too many drinks at the Clarendon Grill (in Arlington) and lost it at some point last night (I'm assuming). 

My grandfather's birthday would have been today, just three days shy of it being a year since his death. My grandmother gave me the watch after he passed. It is a black Skagen watch with a blue face and a metal band and clasp. 

I know this is a long shot, but if anyone found such a watch or knows someone who did, please message me. I parked at the intersection of N. Fillmore and 10th street. I walked north on Fillmore to 11th and walked west to the Clarendon Grill. At 11 o'clock I hopped over to American Tap Room for a beer and then made it back to the Grill where I finished out the night. My friends walked me back to my car, the same way I came walked to the Grill, and drove me home. My assumption is that somewhere on the walk back to the car it slipped off my wrist. Or, potentially at the Clarendon Grill (although they didn't find it).

I've explored every inch of you and gotten the opportunity to experience the touristy sites as well as the ones that are off the oft traveled trail. I've had homemade pop-tarts and alcoholic milkshakes in your eclectic restaurants and had nights I cannot remember due to some of your fantastic bars. I've experienced the ups and downs of of your baseball and hockey teams. I will always remember the people, driven but friendly. But most of all, I will remember how much I will miss you DC.

In each car he picks up a few newspapers left by previous customers and looks over them before stuffing them into his bag. After picking up a few papers, he reaches into his bag and removes a few newspapers. He then looks over each of the papers from his bag before moving around the car and stuffing a full papers into 3 or 4 seats on the car. He then moves on to the next car and does the same thing. Curious, I began creeping on him, looking at the papers for a pattern. Yesterday, I realized that every paper he leaves each day is from the same date, and it's always exactly a month earlier: so if today is Dec. 20, every paper he leaves on red line trains is from Nov. 20.

On my way home from an overnight shift, I stumbled upon a dog that had been tied to a flower box outside of St. Matthews Church on RI, next to a purple Vespa. Her leash had broken off and I caught her running down the sidewalk towards the Y.

I waited for an hour by the broken off leash, and no one came back, so I left a note on how to reach me and took her home. We've been calling her Vespa.

She's a mostly black what I'm guessing to be a boxer-terrier mix, fairly well behaved and housebroken. She does seem to have a touch of the mange, or some other skin irritation. (Hopefully pics to come if I can find my damn camera.)

I'll keep her for a day or two, but if I don't hear anything, I'll be taking her to the Humane Society.

If anyone knows anything about this dog, or has any idea where she may have come from, please contact me.

If you're the owner; you should be ashamed of yourself. It's been three and a half hours. Vespa's a little sweetheart. Come get your dog, take her to the vet and get her treatments taken care of.

Edit- My roommate took some [pictures](http://imgur.com/a/Oi40L) of her. I've also posted her picture [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/1hi2yg/found_near_dupont_circle_dc_we_call_her_vespa/) in /r/aww hoping that someone not in this sub might recognize her. If you can think of any other reddit places I might find some help, let me know.

**UPDATE:** I'm back at work, and the note I left is still there. No one has contacted me yet about claiming Vespa, but she's made herself at home in my apartment. We've learned that she's housebroken (thank FSM) and has extremely good manners. She spent most of the day chilling on the floor of my room while I slept. Thanks to everyone for your help. I've posted her picture on multiple lost-dog message boards. Hopefully things will pan out. If not, she'll make someone more deserving a very good pet.

**UPDATE2:** I decided to take Vespa to the Humane Society to see if she had a chip. (She did not.) I was planning on taking her home and keeping her for a few more days to continue the search, but after talking with one of their techs, they recommended she start treatment for her skin asap. As much as I wanted to keep her with me a few more days, they were right. Her health comes first, so Vespa and I said our goodbyes.

If anyone is still interested in her, she can be found [here](http://www.petango.com/webservices/adoptablesearch/wsFoundAnimalDetails.aspx?id=20374528&amp;css=http://www.petango.com/WebServices/adoptablesearch/css/styles.css&amp;authkey=uopok4cnn4h4m336hlncl322nd6ibjars633i31p78nof017if) on the Humane Society's ""Found Dog"" page.

I plan on keeping updated on her progress, and if they can't find her a home, they're contacting me so I can take her back as a foster dog.

Like an IDIOT, I trusted the guy to be a rational, honest person and didn't put our agreement in writing. I did, however, have a very detailed ad describing the housing situation, including a sentence saying that occasional overnight guests were OK, but frequent overnight guests were not because of the size of the place. Upon moving in, his girlfriend started spending 4-5 nights in the apartment. When I spoke to him about it, his response was to basically say, tough shit. Now it's just awful living with him. We don't even acknowledge each others' existence. He knows I want him to move and he just doesn't seem to care. In fact, he told me I should move (even though I have lived here for over two years, it's my stuff furnishing the place, and he doesn't even know who the landlords are since I pay the bills). 

I offered to pay him $300 for moving expenses if he would move out, and he refused. He's currently unemployed, but doesn't seem to be hustling for anything. I think his parents basically foot the bill.

Anyway ... Maybe this is just me venting. I would love for someone with experience from the landlord side of things to give me some advice. DC is so damn tenant friendly! And I say that as a tenant!

I grew up in Columbia Heights, moved to Brookland and went to school in Chicago. As someone who has never placed an emphasis on skin color personally I have experienced it on many levels. 

Tonight I walk home in my neighborhood and speak to a couple who were nearly about to step on an insect I told them to watch out. With heads down and zero eye contact they don't even acknowledge me. Maybe communication is something that should be had between folks that know each other, but I didn't understand why the words I said made no difference to them. This isn't the first time this has happened to me. If it isn't someone ignoring me. They are holding their purse close when I ask for the time, or crossing the empty street to avoid walking past. I completely understand that there is a stigma to the commmunity I may visibly represent, but when are the actions of a few used to judge everyone of an entire population. I'm posting this here because when I first subscribed to washingtonDC I thought it would be a place for people to post cool things happening around the city. Instead everyday it's populated with race baiting from transients who blame Black people for everything that's wrong with this city. 
I honestly don't know where else to go, other than I'm saddened by this disparaging nature, and know not how to move forward.

Have you always wanted an Apu, Abed, Raj Koothrapalli, Tom Haverford or Fez for company? I'm your man.

I exhibit all the positive stereotypes. I can do multivariate calculus even while my brain is being eating by Hannibal Lecter (excuse the imagery), spell crazy English words that sound French accurately, dance like a brown MJ, worship cows and kick the crap out of competitive exams. The only downside is I am not a Doctor. I am an Engineer with a postgraduate degree, but, that doesn't damn near enjoy the same respect. I also exhibit the highly desirable qualities of being irreverent, self-deprecating, self-loathing, condescending and complaining about irrelevant things like George Costanza. 

I strongly believe in the aphorism (see?) ""Be the roommate you want yours to be"". So, I pay the rent on time, stay the hell out of everyone's way and am mostly not home (I'd probably be schlepping around DC/Arlington a la Ministry of Silly Walks). But, like most people, I can be fun in small doses. 

So, if you have a room in your place that is close to a metro with room for parking along the Orange line metro (Ballston, Clarendon, Rosslyn, East Falls Church), let me know. If you've always wanted to take a semester off while in college and volunteer in a 3rd world country, but, could not for whatever reason, you should definitely contact me. I am the closest thing to that experience you never had. I also use run-on sentences. Deal with it. 

I am willing to part with a little over 10 Benjamins per month on or before Oct. 1.

**Edit:** Guys, listen, don't just upvote and move on. I seriously need a place. Let your friends, friends of friends, baristas, random people on public transit, and current/ex-girlfriends/boyfriends know.

I'm trying to do one tomorrow (Thursday, July 17th) at the Topaz Hotel in Dupont Circle.  The thing about it is though, they only allow new people to come do standup if they bring five or more friends over 21 with them.  So I realize this is kind of a desperate gamble, but I'm not sure I have enough friends around the area to come see me do comedy.  If any of you kind DC-ites who are 21 or over would be willing to come be one of my group of friends and help me get in, that would be awesome.  Send me a PM if you're interested!  You'd need to get there around 7, and it would be and I believe nine other stand up comics.  Here's the information for anyone interested; http://standupcomedytogo.com/see-a-show/topaz-thursdays/

SECOND EDIT: Wow, this has really been an absolutely fantastic response from you guys!  Thank you all so much!  Between the friends of mine who have said they would come and between all you lovely people, I'm definitely going to have enough people there....and probably way way more than five.  You guys are absolutely amazing!

Second Washington Post article - http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/going-out-guide/wp/2013/02/06/cool-disco-dan-documentary-connects-d-c-breakdancer-to-a-portrait-of-the-past/

The Washington Post article pretty much tells how I connected with California.  He's in a Breakdancing / DiscoDan documentary that will be played in a few weeks.  Maura contacted the person who created the documentary and from there contacted California.  Then I was given California's info and called him!  :D 

California actually remembered myself and my mother.  :-)  We talked about breakdancing back in the 1980s, how being a chef in a way is artistry in creating items that people enjoy, just like my mother's paintings.  I told him about another breakdancer I had contacted to try and find him, and he goes,""CHARLES **** ?  I haven't heard from him in DECADES!  I'm glad he's doing well!""

I told him that he really was a big part of my childhood, that he helped shaped me in a good way, and that I never forgot him.  He said that he was thankful for the compliment and that others over the years have said the same thing, and he's usually blown away by it and feels humbled that he touched so many lives.   I also told him he was probably a bit reason that I love dance music so much.  I don't remember any of the music he played while we were learning how to breakdance, but my mother did.  I told California this story -- one time I gave her a CD full of dance music and we were listening to it.  As we were listening to ""Somebody Else's Guy"" by Jocelyn Brown, my mother exclaims,""Wow, thanks for this CD, that is a song California used to play while you were in breakdancing classes and I never could figure the title or artist!""

I told California that he owns this painting and that I'm just storing it for him in the meanwhile.  I need to contact him again to make arrangements, but I do believe he will be coming from Atlanta to the Memphis area some time in the next couple of weeks to pick up the painting.  I will let you all know what happens in another update when he picks up the painting!  I will be taking photos and he said he would bring up a dish or two of his signature recipes.  :-)

If you all have any questions for me, please feel free to ask!

After a long wait, I finally got to a nice agent who helped me out. Turns out the dbag who stole my wallet was using my SmarTrip and put some money on it. The agent was able to transfer the amount from my old card to my new one, netting me about $12 of the thief's money.

I'm an alcoholic. And I mean hardcore. I've been drinking myself to death for almost 30 years... and I'm sick of it. For the last month, it's gotten so bad that when I go to the bar at happy hour, I shake so bad I need both hands to get my first 4 shots of whiskey to my mouth. I can see in my bartenders' eyes that they know what's up.

What I'm looking for is a 72 hour inpatient alcohol detox facility. I've tried ""tapering"" and it's worked before, but not this time. I need a detox so I can get my life back on track. Also, I'm ""self-employed"" (which basically means unemployed and working the random freelance gig) so I have some money, but not a lot. Hell, that's the main reason I'm making this plea.... I need to fix this so I can get another full time job.

Can someone here point me in the right direction?

EDIT: There is a place, about a mile from my apt, that a redditor hooked me up with. I'm going as soon as I wake up in the morning. I've already called them and they're waiting for me. If it's possible, I'll give updates over the next few days.

Again... I thank you all so much for your support and advice.... fuck... I think that's all I can say.

MORE EDIT: Everyone get off Mister_Snrub's ass. I'm a Christian but I give no creedence to AA or NA because I've been through that. Even if he is an asshole, he's well meaning so I won't begrudge him that. But this is not a fucking fight... so fucking stop it.

Please share your stories here! I know a lot of us have them, so let's hear it!

I'll kick it off: My commute home was 13 miles from NW DC to NoVA and it took me 4 hours and 20 minutes. I made it to Tysons from NW DC in about an hour, but it took me 3+ more hours to drive about 3 miles. I ended up pushing 2 cars and actually had to hop into a woman's Mercedes to help her drive around a corner.

Michael Joel Hall, a well-known local yoga instructor, was brutalized and beaten by a gang near his home on 3rd St., NE and T – he just came out of surgery after most of the bones on one side of his face were broken.

The additionally tragic part of this story is that Michael Joel Hall and Michael Roike's apartment burned down only a month ago - neither of them had renter's insurance and Michael Joel Hall does not have health insurance. God damn.

There is going to be a fundraiser (details forthcoming) but there's already a paypal account set up (just in case anyone here knows them or wants to give). Not sure whether it's a hate crime yet.  We're also trying to get local coverage.

This was 20 year old Darnell Christopher Ross of Upper Marlboro who apparently fell into the crosswalk, was ran over by the vehicle in the videos below, and the driver fled the scene.   It also looks like some of the video captured a passenger go to/coming from the metro station at some point.

I was fortunate enough to stumble across a bar in DC that has a playable N64 in it with a ton of awesome old games.  I don't know about you guys, but I think drinking beer and playing some multiplayer Smash Bros and Mario Kart is about all I'd want to do with my Thursday night.

So I'm thinking, why not?

Anyone who's interested in forming a small gaming/drinking group, now's your chance to speak up.  The bar's got pool too, and the bartenders are pretty cool.  The bar's called Bottom's Up, on 18th in Adams Morgan.  

Let's-a-go.


**EDIT:** People seem down.  Awesome.  I'm putting the first night for this as **Thursday, 3/14 starting at 8:30PM.**  Feel free to just show up, or PM me for my number if you want to coordinate.  

**EDIT 2:** Future dates are flexible.  This Thursday night will kick us off, but if other nights work better, speak up!

**EDIT 3:** Address for Bottom's Up is 2309 18th st NW.  It's right underneath the Pi Pizzeria in Adams Morgan.

Six week old, Superkitten had pectus excavatum surgery a few weeks ago! His deformity was pretty extreme and he was starting to show significant clinical signs. His heart was being displaced and his respiratory rate was increased. One of our vets placed a sternal splint to reshape his little rib cage. The surgery was successful! The vet says he will have no special needs other than regular vet care. He plays well with others but tires easily so he would probably not be best for a multicat household. He's currently in Waldorf, MD and is available for adoption! Message me if you are interested!

My name is Deric and I started managing at Public Bar Tenly Town.  I work Tuesday nights from 6 until close, regularly (my other days vary).  If you're in the area stop by.  Find me and tell me you're from Reddit I'll buy you a round. If you're actually wearing a Reddit shirt, I'll probably buy you two. 

That's it.  It's just an FYI.

The address is:
4611 41st St NW, Washington, DC 20016

Alright,

Food: As of now, the menu mirrors that found at Public Bar DC. However, we plan on getting our own menu (with brunch options) soon. That being said, it's typical sports bar food - burgers, fries, wings, salads, nachos, etc. We will have pizza when we get the new menu. (we have a real pizza oven!""

Beers: This is off the top of my head but on tap I believe we have: heiniken, miller lite, PBR, guiniess, Sam Adams (noble pils), new castle, blue moon, peroni.

In cans we also have: Milwaukee's Best, a cider (forgot name), and another lager that i forget.

We don't have any IPAs but we are going to work on that. Dogfish, I think.

The staff is super friendly and I'm pretty nice too. We have 20+ TVs and I can have 21 different channels.

But this is all nothing compared to one simple fact: We have motherfucking skeeball and we plan on having some motherfucking skeeball tournaments.

Also  -- Any interest in beer pong, flip cup, or tournaments of these two events?

A local DC non-profit, [Brainfood DC](http://www.brain-food.org/), is hosting a Burger Cookoff between 10 of DC's top chefs. The event is being held at Poste Moderne Brasserie's courtyard on June 30th. 

The event is all you can eat and all you can drink (alcohol provided by Mad Fox Brewing, 3 Stars Brewing and Brewery Ommegang, and Port City Brewing). It costs $75 which benefit Brainfood DC.

However, theres another way to get tickets. They are having a twitter contest that ends this sunday where you take a picture of you eating or making a burger and tweet it to @BrainfoodDC with the hashtag #DCBurgerBattle. You're then entered to win a pair of tickets to the event!

This post has been approved by the mods, and full disclosure, this is for a client's account I work on.

1355689119.0,59,self.washingtondc,14ydrc,Posted here a while ago asking for interview advice in DC. Thank you all so much!,80,21,56,http://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/14ydrc/posted_here_a_while_ago_asking_for_interview/,"Dear all,

A few days ago I [asked](http://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/146cde/going_to_dc_for_an_interview_words_of_advice/) for some advice on traveling to DC for an interview. I apologize for making another self post in such a short amount of time (seems narcissistic), but received such a lovely amount of responses on that post that I really wanted to do an update and thank you all again.

- Followed the walk-left-stand-right rule at all times.

- I bought a farecard and panicked when it wouldn't let me get out of the station (turned out the card was like 5 cents short). There was a glass booth nearby with a lady in it. I tried to get her attention; no response. Rang the buzzer. She picked up a phone and started talking on it. I waited until she was done, then tried ringing the buzzer again. She finally turned around to face me and said something unintelligible. I asked her to repeat herself; she rolled her eyes and turned away. Horrible attitude.

- As soon as I got out of McPherson Square station, I literally immediately walked into a bunch of police cars, several LEOs, and a guy holding up a sign and yelling something at passersby. I think he was protesting something? Everyone else didn't bat an eye and kept walking. Guess they must be used to it.

- Stupid mistake: thought 14th St was the same thing as 1400, and walked in the wrong direction for about 10 minutes.

- There was so much construction going on!

- Took the recommendation of several people and ate at a place called Cosi. Wanted to share a nice story: I was initially confused about how the ""line"" there worked, and this older guy (about my dad's age) in a suit rolls his eyes at me, points in front of him, and says, ""there's a line, you go here."" I thought he was annoyed at me (""damn tourists!"" sentiment, possibly). Then the guy does a complete 180 and asks, ""where are you from?"" I tell him Atlanta. ""Welcome to DC!"" he says. ""You'll love it here. It's a wonderful city."" He also wished me good luck on my interview. This type of thing just doesn't happen in Atlanta.

- Love the fact that so many people here wear sharp-looking suits.

- Watched the President light up the Christmas tree from a TV at the airport; a truly magical moment, as was the experience of taking off from National Airport at night and looking down at the city lights.

Anyways, happy to say I got the job and will be moving up here soon! Thanks you all so much &amp; hope to get the chance to meet you at future events!",,False,,t5_2qi2g,False,,,True,t3_14ydrc,http://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/14ydrc/posted_here_a_while_ago_asking_for_interview/,

June 29th 9am (ish) someone led the police on a chase going the wrong way on 50-E then 295-N (correction). The driver ran me off the road and totaled my car. I got in contact with the MPDC who didn't have any record of a chase and have been ""extremley helpful"" tracking down this incident for me (possibly started in PG county).

My insurance is treating this as my fault (since I didn't have the forethought to, you know, collide with the car coming at me full speed) but if I can get a hold of an actual police report concerning this chase... it can change.

My new roommate, who just moved in, said our landlord came into his room (this is about 10pm on Wednesday) in only his underwear and asked my roommate to come sleep with him in his room (the landlord's room). 

My roommate fled the house and called me for help. I went downstairs looking for him, knocked on his door and saw the landlord in his room in his underwear.  He said the roommate had been *""acting weird.""*

I eventually got a hold of my roommate and found him outside. He told me what happened, that his uncle was coming to pick him up and that he was moving out immediately. 

We get back to the house and the door to his room was locked. We knocked and the landlord opened the door from inside his room (they share an inside door between rooms, which gives the landlord access).  My roommate started packing while I stood there.  The landlord was calling him crazy and telling me that he was lazy (he was supposed to help the landlord with something) and then kicked him out right then and there.

Two days later, my roommate wrote three of us in the house explaining exactly what had happened.  I have little reason to doubt him and have seen weird behavior from my landlord in the past.  I also suspect my landlord has been in my room without giving me notice when I'm not home.  

I'm creeped out and would like to move out sooner than when my lease ends (end of July).  Is there anyone familiar with rental law? What are my and my roommates options (they're also alarmed)? I also wonder if he's done this before, he's been renting out the rooms in his house since the early 90s.

Advice?
