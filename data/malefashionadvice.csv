My three goals are to (1) outline the basic principles of dressing well and starting a wardrobe, (2) provide some suggestions for what basic items to buy (with a focus on affordability and availability), and (3)  list some additional resources for learning more.

But before diving in, two quick things to note.  First, this guide focuses on casual through business casual, since the primary audience is the prototypical MFA user (20s, student/young professional, no/part-time job, according to the 2012 community survey).  Second, there’s an American bias, both in terms of style and stores/brands.  According to the same community survey, about 80% are in the US, so the community is naturally going to lean that direction.  If there’s a Canadian, British, Australian, Japanese, or any other international user who wants to post country-specific advice or brand recommendations in the comments, I know other folks appreciate it. 

----

**I.  Basic Principles**

----
My general recommendations for building a basic, starter wardrobe are:

 * ***Fit, Fit, Fit.***  Cheap clothes that fit well are always going to look better than expensive clothes that don’t. Finding the right fit may mean trying on lots of different brands until you find something that fits your body right off the rack and/or finding a local tailor that you can trust.  The [*How Clothes Should Fit* guide in the sidebar]( http://redd.it/ehrtv) is an excellent resource, but the quickest rules of thumb are that shoulder seams should sit at the top of your natural shoulder instead of drooping down your arms, pants should stay up without a belt, and clothes should follow the lines of your body without being excessively tight or baggy.  Those are true whether you’re thin or heavy, tall or short, a bodybuilder or a marathon runner – the basic rules of fit don’t change.  

 * ***Versatility is Key.*** Don't buy individual *outfits* - look for versatile clothes that can be mixed and matched.   A few pairs of pants and a handful of shirts can be combined and recombined into a massive number of outfits.  In fact, building a versatile wardrobe instead of buying distinct outfits is one of the most frugal decisions you can make.  

 * ***There's No Shame in Simplicity.***  You see a lot of complaints on MFA (and probably in this very thread) about how the community doesn't encourage people to develop their personal style or unique flair, but you've got to learn to walk before you learn to run.   Frankly, simply wearing well-fitting basics is going to set you apart from the crowd.  They’re a foundation to build your personal style from – a way to look socially acceptable while you’re learning, expanding and refining your taste.  See [this comment]( http://tinyurl.com/8tetkoh) from u/AlGoreVidalSassoon about laying down a foundation, and  [this excellent comment]( http://tinyurl.com/8h47g8h) from u/TheHeartofTuxes about crafting a unique, expressive personal style.  

----

**II.  Building a Basic Wardrobe**

----

Don’t read this as a list of requirements to be well-dressed – rather, it’s a set of budget-friendly, versatile, classic basics that are hard to go wrong with and easy to wear across different ages and body types.  If you're beyond these basics and need more tailored advice or advanced guidance, check out the guides linked within or post the question to MFA.  

In general, the stores/websites I recommend looking at for basics are Uniqlo, Target (especially the Mossimo and Merona brands), J.Crew, Lands’ End (including the Canvas line, which is aimed at a younger audience), JCPenney (in particular, their Levi’s sections and the new JCP line), H&amp;M, LL Bean and Gap.

Unless you live somewhere without seasonal weather variation, it’s worth thinking about the basic wardrobe in terms of spring/summer and fall/winter - 

**A.  Spring/Summer Basics**  (see [the spring/summer guide from the sidebar]( http://redd.it/oqc1c) for a more detailed discussion)

 * Shirts - For casual outfits, you can get a lot of versatility from just 3-4 solid-colored t-shirts ([Mossimo]( http://tinyurl.com/9pcr9bg),[ Uniqlo]( http://tinyurl.com/9av8865)) and a couple short-sleeve polos ([J.Crew]( http://tinyurl.com/8r6h8xb), [Uniqlo](http://bit.ly/XxdpRW)).  For casual through business casual, staples include long-sleeve oxford-cloth button-downs (ocbds) in white or blue ([JCP](http://jcp.is/XQ3uDD), [Lands’ End]( http://tinyurl.com/8d5sp6o))  and long-sleeve shirts in classic summer patterns like [madras]( http://i.imgur.com/9nMcr.jpg) and [gingham]( http://i.imgur.com/JbMRG.jpg).  [Roll up the sleeves]( http://redd.it/zvrrc)  to wear them more casually, keep them rolled down for business casual.  For a basic wardrobe, I recommend avoiding black shirts (even tees) and short-sleeve button-up shirts.  [See the guide to shirts on the sidebar for more info.]( http://redd.it/vor0m)  

 * Pants – For the spring and summer, the core items in a casual wardrobe are jeans and chinos.  Look for dark blue, non-distressed jeans in a slim/straight fit ([Levi's 511/514/501, depending on body type]( http://tinyurl.com/8reth95)), and flat-front slim-fitting chinos in tan/khaki, olive green or navy ([Dockers D1 or Alphas]( http://tinyurl.com/9acx5gp), [Lands’ End Canvas]( http://tinyurl.com/9eeys38), [Gap]( http://tinyurl.com/onm4k)).  Depending on where you live and how you feel about them, shorts are useful too.  For shorts, look for flat-front, solid-colored chino shorts without cargo pockets that hit somewhere between at your knee to 2” above.  [Here's a visual guide.](http://redd.it/1968m0)

 * Jacket - Depending on where you live, a lightweight rain jacket ([Uniqlo](http://bit.ly/108s07p), [Penfield](http://bit.ly/ZHpdv7)) or pullover anorak ([LL Bean](http://tinyurl.com/cqckmmr)) might be worth investing in.  Even a classic tan trench coat if your style leans dressier ([http://bit.ly/ZqRtt2))

 * Sportcoat/blazer - For business casual, a navy blazer, lightweight gray wool sportcoat, or tan cotton jacket are indispensible.  

 * Shoes – The shoe guide has much more on this, but for casual spring/summer outfits, it’s hard to go wrong with classic white or grey canvas sneakers ([Jack Purcells]( http://www.zappos.com/converse-jack-purcell-cp-white-white),[ Vans]( http://www.zappos.com/vans-authentic-core-classics-navy)) or some version of moccasins ([LL Bean blucher mocs]( http://tinyurl.com/8bcwmea) ,[Sperry Top-siders]( http://www.zappos.com/sperry-top-sider-authentic-original-sahara)).  These can be worn with jeans, chinos or shorts, so they’re very versatile.  Chukka boots with rubber or crepe soles are another common spring/summer recommendation ([Clarks](http://tinyurl.com/av3metw)).  All of them can be worn sockless or with [no-show loafer socks.](http://tinyurl.com/9lh2vaj)  When you get closer to the business casual end of the spectrum, a pair of brown captoes or wingtips are workhorses ([Allen Edmonds](http://tinyurl.com/chmvaeu), [Stafford](http://tinyurl.com/afxgluh)).

 * Accessories – Other things you may want to invest in are sunglasses (Wayfarers, Clubmasters, aviators, or knockoffs from mall kiosks), a watch ([Timex Weekender](http://tgt.biz/Zg32wj), [Seiko 5]( http://tinyurl.com/9pbsc6z)), ties ([2.5” knit, solid silk, and subtle stripes]( http://www.thetiebar.com/)) and caps ([simple baseball caps](http://bit.ly/fCJzWE)) are all worth looking at and investing in.

**B.  Fall/Winter Basics** (again, see the [fall]( http://redd.it/yx2b4) and [winter]( http://redd.it/mhkqf) guides for more)

 * Shirts/Sweaters -  Look for some [heavier-weight fall/winter shirts]( http://redd.it/10rkh0), and/or add some layers over the shirts from the spring/summer section.  Cotton or wool crewneck sweaters in earth tones like navy and green ([Lands’ End]( http://tinyurl.com/9g5lbqd), [LL Bean](http://bit.ly/142SdX7)), thinner v-neck merino wool sweaters ([Target]( http://tinyurl.com/9cqnjc8), [J.Crew]( http://tinyurl.com/9xekv9q), [Uniqlo](http://bit.ly/UYwtQT)), and cardigans ([Uniqlo](http://bit.ly/16EOTgi), [Target]( http://tinyurl.com/93kdzht)) are all basics worth considering.  

 * Pants – You can obviously keep wearing the jeans and chinos from the spring/summer section, but if you want to expand into some seasonal pants, consider darker chinos (charcoal, brown, merlot), wool pants, or cords.  [See the pants guide on the sidebar for more.](http://redd.it/ttoyw)

 * Shoes/Boots – The boot guide on the sidebar is very thorough, but for basics, I recommend a pair of brown leather work boots ([Chippewa]( http://tinyurl.com/9lyaxhj), [Red Wing]( http://tinyurl.com/8e36lk5)) and some rain/snow boots ([LL Bean]( http://redd.it/11srff), [Sorel]( http://tinyurl.com/926gfch)) (depending on your local weather, of course).

 * Outerwear – What you need obviously depends on region, but a peacoat in charcoal or navy is hard to do wrong ([Schott]( http://tinyurl.com/8pa7k7c), [J.Crew]( http://tinyurl.com/26y3zlw).  For colder weather, a hooded parka is virtually a necessity ([LL Bean]( http://tinyurl.com/94opgs3), [Lands’ End]( http://tinyurl.com/9uvvbl8)).   You can buy cheap versions of these coats at places like Target, but if warmth is your goal, outerwear is something worth investing in.

From Sunday May 5th through Sunday May 19th, we're going to flip the switch to make /r/malefashionadvice a self-post-only sub.  That means you won't be able to include links (imgur, blogs, store websites, etc) in the title of your posts, although you can certainly still include them in the body of a text post.  We're hoping you'll supplement that link with [more detail and context,](http://redd.it/l9xst) and that it will generate better discussion *and better advice for you* than a simple ""Whaddya think"" imgur link.  

For example, [we made the move to self-posts for inspiration albums a few weeks ago (plus a few additional rules),](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/1ao4at/mfa_rules_update_official_policy_regarding/) and while it has decreased the quantity of this type of posts, many would say it has increased their quality.  At the same time, however, it has also changed how many MFA subscribers are exposed to these albums.  [Searching for inspiration album and sorting by new](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/search?q=inspiration+album&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on) shows that most new inspiration album posts are getting 100-200 upvotes consistently.  Before the guidelines for inspiration albums changed, the spread was much greater - many got no traction at all while others hit the top of the sub (and /r/all) with 500-2000+ votes.  The trade-off, in other words, has been context for exposure.  

Now we're going to give it a trial period for all of /r/malefashionadvice.

Some of you will love the change, some of you will hate it, and [there will probably be some fodder for SubredditDrama.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/search?q=self+post&amp;restrict_sr=on.)  I've outlined some of my concerns [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/1cv80g/why_im_hesitant_to_go_selfpost_only/), /u/schiaparelli (a moderator for /r/femalefashionadvice and all-around cool cat) eloquently responded with her thoughts and FFA's experience [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/1cv80g/why_im_hesitant_to_go_selfpost_only/c9kfvcz) and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/1cv80g/why_im_hesitant_to_go_selfpost_only/c9ky1wr). 

What we ask is that everyone - whether you've lobbied for the change, think it's a terrible idea, feel meh about it, or have never thought about it before - *keeps an open mind*.  Regular users, lurkers, brand-new subscribers alike - we hope you'll give a little bit of thought to the character of MFA over the next couple weeks, and participate in the wrap-up/assessment post on Sunday the 19th.  How did it change the community?  *Did* it at all?  For the better?  For the worse?  How so?  If you're new, try to put yourself in the shoes of a long-time regular.  If you're a regular contributor, try to put yourself in the shoes of a brand-new subscriber.  And, of course, everyone should put themselves in the shoes from the just-released New Balance^TM Yacht Club collection, because all of the mods are corporate shills getting paid under the table.

So away we go.

Today's post is a chance for the community to nominate, vote on, lobby for, and discuss users/posts/comments in each of the five categories posted in the comments below.  **Please reply to my comments with your nominations instead of making new top-level comments - that'll make it easier to identify the top nominees in each category.  I'm going to actively remove comments that don't nominate/discuss/contribute.**

On Thursday, the five top-rated nominees in each of the five categories will go into a final round of voting, which will be an anonymous poll instead of up/downvotes.   

On Friday, we'll announce the winners, and ~~ballads of bravery and derring-do shall be written in their honor~~ it sounds like they get Reddit Gold.  

Thanks for participating in MFA's Best of 2012 Awards, and thanks to everyone who has helped make MFA a strong, vibrant, rapidly-growing community!

[At the request of some of MFA's most active members and regular contributors, we decided to do a self-post-only trial period for two weeks.](http://redd.it/1doc68)  Now it's 5/19 and the end of the trial - **Reckoning Day**.  

We encouraged everyone to keep an open mind, whether you thought it was a terrible or fantastic idea for the sub, or didn't care very much one way or the other.  Now we'd like to hear your thoughts - with a special invitation to lurkers and new subscribers.  In particular, we'd like to hear from folks who changed their mind during the trial period or got a new perspective (in either direction).

And remember - no change is permanent, and whatever we do after this will probably also change at some point in the future.  Everything is ephemeral; this too shall end.

What can I say?  I like baggy clothes.  They're telling me that the shirts are way too large and the jeans are too baggy...And I need a new haricut.  Also no more tennis shoes.

Is there anything else not so great with the outfits?  Now for the fun part, how do I go about fixing this?  I feel like shirtwise none of the shirts I try on fit too well and jeanwise I don't really like the feel of the slim slim cuts.

I'm about 5'11"" 140-145 lbs.  My shoulders and arms aren't too large which makes fitting shirts really difficult.  I did take a look at the [fit guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/ehrtv/shujins_comprehensive_fit_guide/) but I feel like I'm not built all that normal.

**tl:dr What stores do you recommend I shop at to fix my lack of fashion sense?  What clothes work well for tallish skinny dudes?** 



**EDIT:**

**Thank you all!**

**My sister is going shopping with me this weekend.  I think I'm going to start with Target and get a few S/XS mossimo/merona shirts to wear around so I'll get used to the smaller size.  Then we'll hit up JCrew once I'm comfortable with the size.  For jeans everyone mentioned Levi's sizes either 514/513 or 511/510.  As for shoes I'm going to think about boots or boat shoes.  Not sure what I want just yet.**

**On the haircut front I'm gonna go short with it like I used to do when I had hair.  If it turns out to be a poor choice I'll buzz it all off.  I constantly shave every other day so I'll play around with looks that include/exclude facial hair.  I personally like the facial hair but we'll see.**

In co-operation with Nick aka [u/shujin](http://www.reddit.com/user/shujin) I've turned his hugely valuable [""How Clothes Should Fit""](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/ehrtv/shujins_comprehensive_fit_guide/) sidebar guide into an 11 page booklet filled with bullet point advice, illustrations, and do's and don'ts organised *I hope* into a simple and easy to understand format.


This guide was the first thing I read when I came to this subreddit and I learned so much from it. A big thank you to Nick who despite being very busy gave generously with his time and rewrote large parts of his original post for me. We've been working on it in our spare time since May. Hopefully as a result more people will read and learn from the guide.  If people enjoy this and there's a demand I might start to do this with other sidebar guides.


Hope you guys like it and find it useful.

How Should I Spend It?,3506,1385,116,http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/1gspr6/ive_got_x_how_should_i_spend_it/,"You just won the lottery.  You got your tax return back.  Your parents gave you some money and a couple of gift cards as a graduation present.  You’ve finally reached your target weight, and none of your old clothes fit anymore.  Now, it’s time to reward yourself with a new wardrobe.  You’ve got $X.  How do you spend it?

Stop.

Breathe.

This is what you should do.

----

**First: Four simple rules.**

----

**1.  Read the sidebar.**  - No, really, read the sidebar.  If you’ve already come this far, you’re clearly making some kind of effort to look better.  Take some more time to look through it.  Read it right now.  Not all at once, not all with equal attention, and don’t expect to absorb everything your first time through.  Read it multiple times, and take it in one bit at a time. 

Start with the “Getting Started Section”, and then the seasonal guides.  Those are the most important.  The rest you can read at your leisure.

**2.  Figure out your personal situation.** - Who are you and what are you dressing for?  Are you looking to update your work wardrobe?  Are you a student in college looking for a more “mature” look?   Do you live in Canada or are you moving to Texas?  Dressing well doesn’t exist in a vacuum, and your context determines your wardrobe needs.  *Ask yourself the questions asked in [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/1h5bbl/how_big_should_a_wardrobe_be/car3z0w) made by /u/Schaiparelli.*

In a similar vein, figure this out: What do you have? What you need?  Prioritize the things you’ll need, like a winter jacket or a suit (or two).   If you’ve already got 4 dress shirts, you don’t need to buy more immediately, even if they don’t fit well.

**3. Buy well-fitting, versatile basics.** - What does this mean?  Hopefully, you’ve read rule #1 and you’ve seen the guide to [the Basic Wardrobe](http://redd.it/12gfbv).  That means you’ve seen the three key principles : Fit, Versatility, and Simplicity. These are the most important things to consider when you’re starting fresh.

* FIT:  There’s a reason the “[How Clothes Should Fit](http://redd.it/ehrtv)” guide is the first guide in the sidebar.  Fit is the most important factor to consider when buying clothes. Case in point: [Daniel Craig in 2002](http://i.imgur.com/cf5NGXD.jpg) vs [Daniel Craig in 2012](http://i.imgur.com/bQOk0cB.jpg). Cheap clothes that fit well are always going to look better than expensive clothes that don’t.
* VERSATILITY:  Buy neutral-colored clothes that can be easily mixed and matched with each other.  Don’t try to buy 3 “outfits”.  Instead, if you buy versatile items, say, 3 shirts and 3 pairs of pants, and you’ll have 9 outfits that look good.  Check out the [Color Guide](http://redd.it/15tjgv) and ""[Building Outfits that Work](http://redd.it/19qc8c)"" for more on this.
* SIMPLICITY:  This usually goes hand-in-hand with versatility.  If you put a bunch of versatile items together, you’ll end up with a clean and simple look.  There’s no shame in simplicity, especially as a beginner.  

These three concepts: fit, versatility, and simplicity, work together to create the idea of “basics”.  For a beginner, this is the easiest and best way to start a new wardrobe.  Once you’ve filled in the gaps of things you need with well-fitting, versatile basics, you’ve created a strong foundation for your wardrobe.  From there, you can build on it in any way you’d like.  

**4. Don’t spend all of your money at once.**
Seriously.  Take all of the money you’re ready to spend and put it in the bank.  Blowing all of your money on clothes at once is a bad idea, and 6 months from now, you’ll regret it.

* It’s too easy to go overboard on buying “basics”.  For a beginner, unless we’re talking socks or underwear, you don’t *need* more than 5 of each item, and more than 3 of any type of item is excessive.  You’ll end up wasting money on things you don’t need, and then you’ll miss a great deal on something you love.
* **Don't buy something just because it's cheap**.  Sales are your friend, but don't ever justify a purchase with ""it's only $20"".  If you can't think of 3 outfits you can wear it with, don't buy it.  That's $20 wasted.
* Even if you’ve read the sidebar guides 10 times each, I can guarantee that you don’t fully understand the key principles of fit, versatility and simplicity yet.  Discerning whether something fits well or not is a difficult skill to pick up, and it is even harder to apply to yourself.  It can only develop with experience.
* Your tastes will change a lot in 6 months.  Take a note from the guide to “[Developing Personal Style](http://redd.it/17mn5x)”, and start collecting a folder of outfits that you like.  You’d be surprised at how much your taste will change.  

Trust me: buying everything at once will lead to a pile of mediocre clothes, disappointment, and thoughts of “why the fuck did I buy that?”. Instead, start with buying slowly and buying cheaply.  **Think hard about your purchases before making them.**

----

**Our Plan of Attack:**


----

**Step one: Figure out your context.**  

Remember rule #2?  Make a list of things you have and a list of things you need.  To make these lists, rely on the appropriate sidebar guide, usually the [Basic Wardrobe Guide](http://redd.it/12gfbv).

**Step two: Try on as many new things as you can, without buying anything.** 

If it’s on your list, go to the mall to see if it works on you.  If it's not, try it on anyways.  Bring someone with you and see if they like it, or take a pic and post it to the Official Feedback and Fit Check thread.  Remember: there is no definitive list of men’s wardrobe essentials; there are only suggestions.  What you need to do is decide if and how an item works for you.  If it doesn’t, take it off your list.

**Step three: Prioritize the purchases you will make.**  

What do you need immediately? What do you already have enough of?  Your absolute priorities (ie. suits or dress code items) should be your first purchases, followed by the things you need.  If you have trouble deciding, consider what you have already and which item is more versatile.  

Think of buying an item as paying to unlock more outfits.  Would you rather pay $30 for a shirt to create 2 new outfits, or $60 for a jacket that will create 10 new outfits?  A good general rule is to prioritize items in this order: shoes, outerwear, tops/bottoms, and accessories.

**Step four: Start shopping with purpose.**  

Don’t shop without knowing exactly what you are looking for.  Shop around, but don’t yield to the temptation of the sale section.  Try things on and compare the **price**, **fit**, and **quality**.  Keep looking until you’ve found something that’s right for you.

**Step five: Don’t buy it just yet.**  

Put your potential purchase out of your mind for a week.  Then come back and look at it with fresh eyes.  Is it still a good idea?  If the answer is yes, go ahead and buy it.

**Step six: Repeat.** 

Repeat until you’ve built a collection of well-fitting and versatile basics for your wardrobe.  By now, you should have a good eye for fit, and you have the taste to make purchases on your own without needing to wait and think about it.  

Now what?  For some, this is the end point of their fashion development.  But maybe, by now, you want to expand beyond the basic wardrobe.

**Step Seven:  Develop your personal style.**  

From here, you must discover your own path.  Listen to the tips in the “[Developing a Personal Style](http://redd.it/17mn5x)” guide, and work from there. Hopefully you’ve been keeping your personal inspiration album.  That’ll give you a direction to start off in.  What happens next is up to you.

----

**So... I’ve Got $X.  What should I buy?**

THE LONG-AWAITED ANSWER:  What you should buy depends on your personal situation, your needs, and what you have already.  Seriously, did you not read any of the words above this?  

**No, but seriously?**

If you want a list of things to buy, check out the [basic wardrobe guide](http://redd.it/12gfbv), and the [assorted lists of essentials]( http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/12gfbv/the_basic_wardobe_40/c6ut3l3) that “all men should have in their wardrobe”.  Don’t take their (or our) word for granted.  Try things on, make sure they fit, and see if they work for you.  Remember, don’t spend it all at once.

**But I don’t like the Basic Wardrobe:**

Check out what the [FAQ has to say](http://redd.it/149k8f).

**When shouldn't I buy something?**

Check out [this post](http://www.styleforum.net/t/303455/the-contentedness-thread/40_40#post_5546275) on styleforum and the comments that follow for a list of reasons you shouldn't buy something.  Check out the rest of the thread, if you have time, too!

----

So I kind of lied.  I wasn't trying to literally answer the question, ""How should I spend $X?"". Instead, I addressed the underlying question:  ""How can I start to look better?""  The answer, of course, is to read the sidebar and lurk on MFA.  But at the moment, the current sidebar is overwhelming.  So I wrote out a guide to getting started on a new wardrobe.

Building a wardrobe that works for you is a monumental personal task, and unfortunately, there’s no quick and simple shortcut.  No one can ""give"" personal style.  If you simply purchase the list of clothes that someone (a stranger!) gave you over the internet, it generally won't work for you because of problems with fit, personal style, and/or creating outfits.

If you need personal advice on getting started, feel free to make your own post and ask your own questions. But before you do, try to answer some of the questions I posed here.

[And here is 185lbs after bulking/cutting from 190](http://i.imgur.com/2lIX1.png)

What did I do?

Honestly, I did exactly what was mentioned in the /r/fitness faq, dropped calories and lifted weights. I probably on average only do cardio 1-2 a week for 10min at a time.

Made my calorie deficit smaller as I got smaller so that I would retain as much muscle as possible.

Owe a lot of my progress to the /r/fitness and /r/weightroom community!

And as for fashion, [here is how I used to dress](http://i.imgur.com/4W4sT.jpg) (basically everyday, oversized hoodie, cargo pants, jeans 4 sizes too big and running shoes everynow and then (as you can guess, I wasn't a runner))

And a sampling of how I dress now

I owe quite a bit of the self confidence I've gained to the /r/malefashionadvice community, maybe even as much as i've gained from dropping the weight and lifting.

So I had an idea after seeing [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/z6ppe/tried_my_hand_at_some_vavltstyle_collages_this_is/) post of making a set of images that could visually transmit the information in the guides. Fashion is a very visual thing and although the text will always be better for explaining why some things are better than others I have always been a fan of the whole ""show don't tell"" thing.

I would like to do this with shirts, tees, belts, jeans, chinos, and even entire outfits. However for now I will be testing out ideas with shoes, more specifically canvas sneakers.

My idea for the canvas sneakers would be to have two main groups of images:
The first would take examples of shoes of different brands and styles that MFA finds good and organize them in the 4 main colors recommended by the [shoe guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/p7usf/shoe_guide_v20/), with some annotations regarding style recommendations on the side. So a sample like [this](http://i.imgur.com/ovvfP.jpg) for blue/navy sneakers, except properly cropped, organized, and with style comments on the side.

So I would love to hear what MFA thinks of this idea, and what would be the best way of going around accomplishing this.

Edit 1: Ok I just got back and from the number of upvotes it sounds like people want this. I will start reading through comments now.

Edit 2: Alright, I finished reading comments and am loving all the support. I Will start working on this as soon as I have free time. I tried to answer a lot of the comments as well, and I will be posting soon enough to show some of my progress and ask for your feedback and criticism so look forward to that!

Update: [Here](http://i.imgur.com/uLjAL.jpg) is the yet untagged and organized prototype of the Basic Brands &amp; Prices picture. I am having troubles finding a large enough Spring Court image, so any help with that would be appreciated, also any criticism (except for criticism involving the absence of the names as I have just said I will put those on in a second sheesh). Though I do need to sleep now so more later int he morning.

**Update 2: I would first like again thank everyone's enthusiasm. Then take some time to point out that some people are already assuming I am a fashion expert, which I am not. I know enough that I believe making the sneaker samples like the one above or similar things for other apparel wont be a problem. However I will be coming to MFA when working on things like [this](http://i.imgur.com/gYVKM.jpg) (yes I know it's ugly, but the idea is what I am trying to get across ok). I believe this is the best way to do this as I would also like MFA to decide which types of outfits I and my new helpers (tukutz, ShezUK, and Aspid92) should be working on. Furthermore the idea has been put out there that this would be much more helpful if we had models with different body types, to which I say no one is stopping people on MFA from modeling the guide we will eventually put together. So starting today I will be working on the shoes, pants, and t-shirts guides. After that I will most likely make another post on MFA (as this one is getting very long, but idk, talk to me mods) where we discuss the first basic outfits we will be putting out. That is all. I welcome criticism and ideas.**",,False,self,t5_2r65t,1346704035.0,,,True,t3_z8jbk,http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/z8jbk/would_mfa_be_interested_in_a_purely_visual/,

But most of the advice catered here is focused on *what pieces you should buy* and not on *how these pieces interact*. We have great guides on creating **wardrobes**, but I feel we lack a guide that adresses how to create **outfits**. The result is that many newcomers end up not knowing how to avail the full potential of their wardrobe or how to take advantage of the clothes they already own.

Of course, building wardrobes and outfits go hand in hand. It's a lot easier to create nice outfits if you have a wardrobe full of pieces that fit you both physically and stylistically. At the same time, it's good to think what kind of outfit you want to create when you're buying stuff.

Now, I should warn you, I'm not an expert on this. I have little more than a year's experience in fashion and most of what I learned comes from MFA itself. So what I want here is to discuss a few guidelines on how to put together individual pieces so that they come together to form something good, as well as avoiding common pitfalls for beginners. I'm sure it's not complete though. There is much more to that than I could possibly explain. I would appreciate very very much if someone more knowledgeable (or more skilled with the english language) than me wants to complement my text in the comments.

**The basic principles of design**

&gt;*To achieve visual unity is a main goal of graphic design. When all elements are in agreement, a design is considered unified. No individual part is viewed as more important than the whole design.*

-Alex White, in *The Elements of Graphic Design*.

I stumbled upon [this link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_elements_and_principles#Principles_of_design) a while ago here in MFA. This small list of principles of design helped me understand better what makes an outfit work or not.

The first of them is **unity** (aka cohesion or synergy). Lack of it is one of the main reasons some outfits in the WAYWT or OFFC threads don't work. If your shoes say something and your jacket says something else, the whole outfit won't look right. Basically, *the outfit should be seen as a whole, not as a sum individual parts.* This is probably the most important ""lesson"" in this guide, and I will return to it before the text is over. This applies to many elements in the outfit: fit, colour, level of formality, style, etc.

That is not to say that there can't be a **hierarchy** between different pieces from an outfit. It's ok to have one of the pieces as the focal point, as long as the outfit is designed to *support* it instead of clashing with it. In [this example](http://cdn.dressed.so/i/50481a91548c5l.jpg) (thanks, disby), the eye is drawn first to the camo shorts, because of the busy pattern, then to the shoes, because of the bright colour, and lastly to the muted t-shirt. So there is a hierarchy here in which the shorts are the ""strongest"" element and the tshirt is the ""weakest"" one. What I mean here as a ""strong"" element is something that draws attention to itself, either because it has a heavy [pattern](http://i.imgur.com/rWZB0jj.jpg), or because the [color](http://i.imgur.com/1ZBW3.jpg) stands out, or because the [fit](http://i.imgur.com/CGUYRj6.jpg) is different, etc. (thanks Balloons_lol, fucks_mulder and huhwot)

When putting together an outfit with items that have different ""strengths"", it is important to be careful in order to maintain a certain **balance**. What that means is that putting too many ""strong"" elements in one part of the outfit (top, bottom, left, right) usually won't look good as distributing them along the outfit. Take [this fit](http://i.imgur.com/UcK1IvN.jpg) (thanks, only56), for example. The tie and the shoes are the *strong* elements, while the shirt and pants are relatively muted. It would look a lot worse if he had gone with strong tie and shirt and muted shoes and pants, because the strong elements would clash and the outfit would look unbalanced. When an element is just [TOO strong](http://i.imgur.com/rWZB0jj.jpg) it's usually advised to keep the rest of the outfit relatively muted.

**The importance of context and creating an image**

&gt;*Actors seek to fulfill the obligations encapsulated in a role, an identity, a membership in a political community or group, and the ethos, practices and expectations of its institutions. Embedded in a social collectivity, they do what they see as appropriate for themselves in a specific type of situation.*

-James G. March and Johan P. Olsen, in *The logic of appropriateness*.

[This recent thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/19muqz/mfa_whats_the_reason_you_started_dressing_better/) teaches us something that is actually pretty obvious: for most people fashion isn't interesting just because of the clothes, it's interesting because of it affects how people perceive you. This is the reason most people get into fashion - they are unsatisfied by how they present themselves to others, and are captivated by the idea of being able to *choose* how their peers will perceive them. In that way, fashion is empowering. (there's been [another recent thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/19fhf8/discussion_how_does_fashion_integrate_into_your/) by milky_funk that has something to do with this)

So when you ask yourself what clothes you want to wear, keep in mind that the actual question is *how do I want to look?* You're not just using pieces of fabric to cover your body, you're trying to create an **image** for yourself. And just how appropriate or ""good"" this image is depends entirely on the **context** it's inserted.

Context here means many things: where (in the world, in your country, in your city) you're from, how old you are, what you do, what's the occasion, etc. Fashion varies wildly across the globe, and what is expected from a 16 year old high-schooler is different from what is expected from a 50 year-old businessman. Keep that in mind: who you are and where you live also play a role in the image I mentioned in the previous paragraph.  

This is why sometimes getting fashion advice and inspiration from the internet may feel disconnected from the reality. Fashion blogs will tell you that every man *needs* a navy blazer, or raw denim, and that just isn't true. These ""essential pieces for a man's wardrobe"" lists take clothes out of their context and strip them of their meaning.

My preferred approach is different ([/fa/'s website preaches a similar idea](http://thefaggotstore.org/)). Pay attention to the ones around you. What do people in your environment wear? Ask yourself how you want to look in contrast to them. Do you want to fit in and look attractive? Do you want to look rebellious and make people uncomfortable? Do you want to look professional and respectable? Do you want to look older? Younger? These are all valid desires and they should guide how you approach fashion. The choice of how you want to look should be a conscious one, based on your desires and expectations to the context that surrounds you. ([More on this subject](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/19nfko/discussion_thread_the_boundaries_of_common/))

---

**Applying all that: fit, colour, formality, style, etc.**

&gt;*This question goes far beyond what you wear. It points to how you engage with life and how life unfolds through you. This is a question of perceiving something that is already happening, not about trying to find the 'right' idea. It's about seeing into an organic process rather than deciding something out of the blue.*

-TheHeartOfTuxes, in his [magnificent comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/xyihx/how_did_you_discover_your_style/c5qum5d) about [finding your own style](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/17mn5x/developing_personal_style_a_collection_of/).

I want here demonstrate how the principles (particularly cohesion) mentioned so far can be applied to different outfit elements.

* First of all, **fit** (and **silhouette**). Although MFA has a skinny bias, there is some variation in what is considered an *acceptable* fit. You should, however try to achieve a certain unity and balance through the outfit. A looser fit all around [can](http://i.imgur.com/vmY6oh.jpg) look [good](http://i.imgur.com/rP9c0URh.jpg) (thanks huhwot and lobstertainment), as [does](http://i.imgur.com/ygKbI.jpg) a full blown [skinny](http://i.imgur.com/zbWpK.jpg) (thanks LeTigreLeTigre and sweetjesusonfire). Another way to achieve balance is to [contrast](http://i.imgur.com/dRbpI.jpg) a [""heavier"" top block](http://i.imgur.com/iUWgJ.jpg) with a [skinnier bottom](http://i.imgur.com/FD5eJ.jpg) (thanks Pokesteve and freench). *I know this section is terribly incomplete, if somebody wants to expand this subject, please do so. For now, I'll just leave a link here to the [wonderful guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/15sej6/guide_understanding_fit_and_proportion_in_an/) on fit and proportions by Schiaparelli for FFA. Hey, now schoonerism [did one](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/1i11f1/style_guide_silhouette/) for us in MFA too!*

* **Colour** is next. Colour is hard to explain, but you usually want to have a *colour scheme* for an outfit. That means a limited combination of colours that work together in a cohesive way. Blue, gray, white and brown is perhaps the most classic and the easiest scheme to work with in male fashion and usually loooks great on both [casual](http://i.imgur.com/ubMA8R8.jpg) and [formal](http://i.imgur.com/RXO1W.jpg) outfits (thanks desmigalhation and skinniouschinnious). Monochromatic schemes are harder to [make work](http://cdn.dressed.so/i/511deb55bf8c4l.jpg), but can look [very awesome](http://i.imgur.com/O8Pyz.jpg) (thanks Azurewrath and milky_funk!). For more info on colour, these guides are useful: [the seasonal approach](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/15tjgv/livemethods_heroically_enormous_seasonal_color/), [the biomimicry theory](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/1280n1/the_biomimicry_color_theory_an_view_on_why_some/) and [FFA's guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/xeyqk/lessons_on_color_theory_and_how_to_apply_it_to/).

* Common mistake when starting to dress: **formality** clash. Many clueless newcomers, based on the common but erroneous notion that dressing up is dressing better, try to ""class up"" a casual outfit by throwing a single, isolated formal piece on top of it. Usually a fedora, a waistcoat, a tie or a suit jacket. It usually ends up looking [terrible](http://i.imm.io/Xvbo.jpeg). See how the jacket says ""formal"" while the other pieces say ""casual"", ruining any hope of unity this outfit might have achieved otherwise? ^((disclaimer: this was posted with the consent of the subject in the picture)^)

* It's usually advisable to have some **style** unity in an outfit as well. What I mean here is that an outfit should say one single message instead of mixing different messages together. If you look rugged from head to toe, the ""concept"" will be easily understood. If you put on a dress shirt, a pair of slacks, dress shoes and a military field jacket, the concept is lost and the outfit is confusing.

* The [fedora](http://youshouldntwearthatfedora.tumblr.com/) is a great example of something that tends to not look good. But is it *possible* to work a fedora into an outfit? I put together [a few pics](http://imgur.com/a/PwC6F) of outfits with fedoras that maybe don't look quite as bad as the ones you usually see. The point is that here the hat is **cohesive** with the outfit, something that is quite hard to do nowadays. You may not like them, though, as I said it's quite hard to make it work.

**A short note on ""breaking the rules""**

&gt;*John Cage didn’t simply stick a bunch of spoons inside a piano and compose avant-garde masterpieces – his prepared piano pieces were an organic development out of years of studying, performing, experimenting and the influence of Indian musical forms and philosophy.*

-Syeknom, in *[Fashion and a Cup of Tea](http://fashionandacupoftea.com/on-fashion-rules/)*.

Keep in mind that these guidelines are just here to help you understand fashion better, with the ultimate purpose of achieving control over your image. These aren't unbreakable laws, just some loose recommendations based mainly on my personal experience and observation. It is, of course, possible to look good even if you break some of these rules, for example wearing [formal pieces](http://cdn.dressed.so/i/50633f7f59891l.jpg) in casual outfits (thanks veroz). The thing is that, if you try this as a beginner, you're most likely to fail.

I need some nice new shorts and chinos so I figured, why not. I ordered and got confirmation, but as I was looking at the confirmation page I hit the cancel button ( my mouse was hovering over it without me noticing and my finger just kinda clicked down as it does sometimes).

I went to replaced my order but the coupon had been used. I decided to e-mail them letting them know of my issue and they said they could hold my order with the discount and I would just have to call to confirm everything. I wasn't able to call back until today and sadly the items I wanted were out of stock in the colors I wanted. They looked through the site with me and we couldn't find any acceptable replacements. 

I figured this was the end of it as it was my fault for hitting cancel and it isn't like they are obligated to do more than hold the order until I can get back to them. Instead, the representative told me that because they were out of stock, I could go to the regular J Crew site and they could help me pick similar items from there. We both went through the site together comparing the chino shorts and long pants and decided on some that were both close to 30 dollars more than the ones on the factory site. I thought they would give me the 25% discount and that would be the end. Again they surprised me saying they would honor the original prices which brought down a 70$ pair of chino pants and 55$ pair of chino shorts down to 27$ each. They even convinced me to add on a belt with 25% off. 

I am blown away by the lengths they made to make me happy when I wasn't upset in the first place and even considered the mistake was on my end. I highly recommend J Crew now just because of their customer service. They could not have been more kind and accommodating. 

Thank you J Crew,

A Satisfied Customer 

Edit: Someone in here mentioned that out would be a good idea to make a guide on good companies. I am sure we would all love to know who has good customer service and not. I think that would be a great idea but am too lazy/unknowledgeable to do it myself.

Decided to throw together this guide / ramble / inspiration because even if it helps one person I'll feel like it's gone to use. I've always been conscious of what I wore but it wasn't until around 19 / 20 years old when my maturity began to show in my clothing choices. I had direction, inspiration and a basic understanding of fit etc, but what I didn't have was the bank account to support my new found hobby. Enter thrifting. Thrifting for alot of you is still unchartered waters. Many of you don't know where to start and some of you have no intentions whatsoever of trying it. That's fine, it's not for everyone, but for those willing to take the time, hopefully this “guide to thrifting” will help you make the most of your treasure hunts. 

First off, to be successful at thrifting you need to go often, and for the most part look through the entire store as to not miss that new arrival that is just made for you. This is what alot of people have trouble with, they either don't have the time, or they don't have the interest, but if you've decided thrifting is for you then that's awesome. For me, thrifting is relaxing. It's a chance for me to wander the isles at my own leisure, not be bugged by pesky sales pressure and it's as if I have an entirely new wardrobe to play with. If nothing else, it has served as some time for me to escape from my busy schedule; finding anything to take home on top of that is simply a bonus. That is definitely the attitude you need to have if you're going to start thrifting. You will not find something EVERY single time you go. Some days it's as if your twin just dropped off a bunch of clothes for you, others you find yourself questioning why those racks of clothes had ever been allowed to see the light of day. Do not get discouraged, frequency is the key to success. 


There are three things that are important to note when you hit the stores and actually start looking for items:

**1) Condition of the piece** 

**2) Price of the piece**

**3) Fit of the piece** 




****
**1) Condition of the piece:**

It should be common knowledge that almost everything in thrift stores has been preowned and due to this fact, has been “pre worn”. This means that sometimes the clothes will show those signs of wear and sometimes can ruin the piece entirely. 

Ex:

- look for stains on the collars and cuffs of dress shirts as well as the arm pits. If it's a shirt you aren't in love with, my suggestion is to pass on to the next one. White dress shirts are a dime a dozen so if the shirt you picked up is more stain than white it probably isn't worth your time to clean. However, if it's something unique, something you can't just put back regardless of the stains, [here's a guide that has yet to fail me](http://putthison.com/post/441812762/cleaningshirts).

- look for any holes, tears, fraying, missing buttons, broken zips etc. I personally find the details in a mans outfit to be the things that contribute to his style the most. It's hard to look stylish with holes in your crotch or cuff buttons missing. That being said, know what you can fix. Many shirts and jackets have extra buttons sewn to the inside of the garment in case you do manage to lose one. This will save you the hassle of trying to match a spare button and 5 mins with a needle and thread and you're as good as new. I don't usually bother with broken zips, but if you need it fixed, your local tailor should be able to replace it for around $15 depending on the job. Holes are sometimes hard to spot first time around. A quick check is to hold it up to the light, holes will jump out at you right away. 

Bottom line, know what you can fix and whether it will even be worth your time and money to fix it. 

**2) Price of the piece:**

Back when I first started thrifting it seemed that places were almost paying YOU to take the clothes because the prices were so cheap. Recently though, thrift stores have seen a huge increase in popularity (Macklemore....) and their prices have been on the rise too. Simple supply and demand, something is only worth as much as people are willing to pay. I never thought I would have to mention price being an issue but the simple fact is that I've seen thrift stores try and charge almost retail prices. Knowledge is your best weapon in a thrift store. If you know how much an item retails for, awesome, if you know how much it's going for on sites like ebay, even better. This is why a smartphone is your best tool to carry on your scavenger hunts. If you can quickly search an item, you may find out that just because the piece is in a thrift store doesn't mean it's the best deal you can get. However, alot can be said for physically having that item in front of you where you can try it on and inspect it. If ebay listing are within 20% of the thrifted item (accounting for s&amp;h), then I usually go with the thrifted item because I know EXACTLY what I'm getting. More than 20% though and the savings online are just too enticing to overcome. 

You also need to account for after purchase spending, i.e your tailoring costs. I'll touch on this more a little later but basically if you pick up a large peacoat for $20 when really you're a size small, you're looking at spending probably over $100 to reconstruct that coat when $120 may have bought you the same coat brand new in a size small. 

Bottom line, know the general pricing of similar items and how much you will need to spend at the tailors to determine whether you are really getting a deal. 

**3) Fit of the piece** 

If you've been lurking around MFA for a while I'm sure that you've realized that fit is of the utmost importance to a successful outfit. You've heard it countless times but a well fitting cheap suit is going to look better than an expensive suit that looks like a hand-me-down from your overweight uncle with enough excess material to shelter a small family. This is where beginners can really benefit from thrifting. You will undoubtedly make mistakes with fit early on in your search for style, why not make them cheap mistakes. Spending $3 on a shirt and finding out the fit is off somewhere down the road will not be as deflating as if you were to do the same with a $60 shirt. I've been there myself, shelled out the cash, worn it past the return date and then woke up one morning thinking “jesus.....when did I think wearing a sail was acceptable as a dress shirt?” Culminating your style is a long process, most of us do not have the money to experiment and iron out the kinks, but with thrifting, you can learn those lessons quicker and with smaller consequences. There's only so much you can learn from viewing posts of “correct fit” and what not. Get out there, use the knowledge you have to get the best fit you can find, and then fine tune from there. Whether you like it or not fashion has become a hobby for you, so don't worry about spending a little money to get better. Now once you feel like you have a grasp on what clothes should fit like, it's time to move into tailoring.

**Tailoring:**

This is where thrifting pays off the most. Because you've kept your initial costs down when buying an item, that means you've freed up a little cash to spend at your tailors. This means (if you've done everything correctly) that you can get a good quality piece that fits you like a glove still for a fraction of the cost of a brand new item. I mentioned it previously, but know what CAN be tailored (pretty much anything) and most importantly, know whats WORTH tailoring. If a jacket needs to be completely reconstructed, chances are that the price to tailor it will exceed what you would pay for that item in stores (ofcourse this is different if it's some $1500 designer jacket). Something as simple as lengthening the sleeves can take a jacket from just off to just right. 


*****************BUY A SEWING MACHINE *******************

If you haven't already, I would recommend that you get yourself a sewing machine and start learning some basic tailoring. Funny enough I picked mine up at a thrift store for $15 so that in itself doesn't have to be a big investment.This is something that I really regret not getting into sooner because it's changed my style A LOT. I'm sure it's happened to you when you've gone thrifting, that one item you love but the sleeves are just a tad short, or the legs are just a tiny bit too wide. Before I would just throw them back to the piles and be bitter that it didn't come how I wanted it. Well now, no problem, I MAKE it the way I want it. One point though is when I recommend this to people they think that a sewing machine will solve all their problems right away. That's not going to happen. It's frustrating at first, time consuming, some of my frankenstein creations early on should never have seen the light of day, but if you stick at it you get quicker and cleaner, now I'm down to slimming down a pair of pants in 20 mins and a shirt in 30. You can literally learn anything you want from the internet, there are plenty of great guides out there to get you started, plenty on youtube and [here is the one that I use when doing my shirts](http://www.reddit.com/r/frugalmalefashion/comments/vuyb7/simple_guide_to_tailoringslimmingtaking_in_your/)

**Quick Tips:**

If you're a little pressed for time, these tips may help you out a bit. 

- Develop a system. I have an order for the sections I look at in a store. It goes shoes, jackets, shirts, pants, t-shirts, bags, accessories. Most of that is just personal preference but the shoes I recommend being first. If you find a pair that you like, put them on while you browse through the rest of the store, you'll find out pretty quickly if they're going to be comfortable or not. Building a system also takes the guess work out of missing something. If you follow your order you will have looked through the entire stock and not missed a thing. 

- Your sense of touch is your best friend. When out in retail stores you should be getting acquainted with what “quality” feels like. Touch the clothes, do they feel soft, sturdy, just generally well made, this one is tougher to explain but it's something that you will develop over time. Once you know what quality feels like, you can apply it to thrifting. Put the palm of your hand on the the clothing and start walking down the isle, you'll know when to stop and take a better look. 

* Know what you need and stick to it. I don't usually recommend this because sometimes the best finds are unexpected, but if you're in a rush just stick to looking at things you need. If you have 50 shirts at home but no jackets, then it doesn't make sense to spend time looking through the shirts section. Stick to your sizing aswell. Most of the time I look up and down a size because sometimes clothing is just blatantly mislabeled (a 32 pant is labeled and sorted into the 34 section), but again, if you're in a rush you will have to pass on the chance that there's something worth while mislabeled. 

**General Tips**

* don't be afraid to look in the woman's section. They often have more interesting fabrics and patterns than guys clothing. The thing that gives away that you may be wearing womens clothing (apart from the fact that they button opposite to mens clothing) is the cut. Extra room in the chest, tighter throughout the waist and wider at the hips. If you were to wear as is, it would be obvious you were in womans clothing, but now since you're a master a DIY tailoring (because you bought a sewing machine like I told you) you can alter the fit completely. Now, apart from the buttons on the other side, noone is the wiser. Plus they sometimes put mens belts in the womens section and 9 times out of 10 you'll be able to find pocket squares in with their scarves. 
See the potential in an item. Things that catch my eye are the unique pieces. I have the basics (OCBD's, dark denim, white v necks) but those are just pieces that allow you to add your personal twist. When I say the ""potential"" in an item I mean you need to see it for more than just the individual piece it is, you need to see how it would fit in your wardrobe, how you could alter it to make it better, how it could be something you could enjoy later as your style evolves. Thrift stores are full of one offs, capitalize on this and you'll have an individual piece you can call your own. 

* **KEEP TRACK OF YOUR SPENDING**. I keep a little book in my room that I note every purchase I make. It's hard to keep track of how much you are REALLY spending because $5 doesn't seem like much, but once you get hooked it become $5 here, $10 there, $7 there and it begins to add up. 

* Buy out of season. Thrift stores operate through donations. Now it doesn't make sense that someone is going to donate their wool pea coat in the dead of winter when they would still most likely need it. Instead, you find that thrift stores are generally one season behind. Winter coats and boots come in in the beginning of spring, shorts and boat shoes come in at the start of Autumn. This is where a bit of confidence in your purchases comes in. You are purchasing something that you most likely won't be wearing for 9 months so I wouldn't recommend buying “trendy” items. Something like a navy pea coat is a timeless classic, the day it is no longer stylish will be a dark day, so things like that will be a solid purchase. 



Now this isn't to brag about my wardrobe because there are others on MFA that have far more impressive wardrobes, but I thought I would show you what taking my own advice has gotten me over the months. Here's a few of my finds, pictures could have been better but they do the job.

1356016242.0,1890,self.malefashionadvice,15649d,A Basic Guide to Target ,2652,762,364,http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/15649d/a_basic_guide_to_target/,"Where I live there are quite literally Targets everywhere, including one less than 2 minutes away from my apartment. [Google and Microsoft Paint help illustrate this.](http://i.imgur.com/zZyos.jpg). This works for me, since I don't have to set foot in Walmart very often, and I like their clothes.

Because of the amount of time I've spent in Target, and on their website, and items of clothing I've tried on and purchased, I have some knowledge about what is good, what is bad, and how to win at Target. I'm going to outline what you can and should purchase, what to avoid, and most importantly, when to purchase certain things.

**Brands at Target**
 
While there are plenty of different clothing brands in Target, only three are really worth noting. Most others are either confined to athletic clothing, or should be avoided- like Denizen denim. These three are Mossimo, Merona, and Converse One Star.
 
**Mossimo Supply Co.** is Target's [younger](http://i.imgur.com/dMFvQ.jpg), [brighter brand](http://i.imgur.com/gbjAa.jpg), with more modern fits. Of late the brand has become [increasingly colorful](http://i.imgur.com/3fx7y.jpg), though while [shirts](http://i.imgur.com/6eE9O.jpg) and hoodies are plentiful, the brand has less outerwear than either other brand, which is too bad. Mossimo is great for picking up some basic items, and the value for the money is great on lots of them- but not all.
 
Fit is [""athletic""](http://i.imgur.com/ZZM9v.jpg) on lots of things, which means tapered through the waist with more room in the shoulders. This means their t-shirts fit particularly well, and their button downs fit closer than Merona or Converse. Occasionally the wording is less accurate, or just wrong- like their [twill 5-pocket pants](http://i.imgur.com/k5rYo.jpg) that boast a ""relaxed fit"" in areas. These pants are not relaxed. Jackets are also a little weird, with similar items sometimes fitting very differently. Their filled windbreaker fits me fine as a small, but a similar looking [hooded windbreaker](http://i.imgur.com/GJnKV.jpg) is unattractively large at the same size.
 
As mentioned, [tees](http://i.imgur.com/PONEW.jpg) are [probably](http://i.imgur.com/30i2p.jpg) the [best](http://i.imgur.com/Twcbl.jpg) Mossimo [item](http://i.imgur.com/i2bWR.jpg). The fit is [great](http://i.imgur.com/ay5vb.jpg), the colors are [solid](http://i.imgur.com/tYOos.jpg), and the quality is very [good](http://i.imgur.com/5higo.jpg) for ~$10. Mine never seem to shrink or stretch, and I've been complimented lots of times on these tees. [Layering items](http://i.imgur.com/yGEtu.jpg), like [henleys](http://i.imgur.com/vXrdy.jpg), [baseball shirts](http://i.imgur.com/Xf1dF.jpg), and [hoodies](http://i.imgur.com/kldHR.jpg) are similar in quality and fit, and come in a wide array of colors. [Mossimo pants](http://i.imgur.com/KEYvX.jpg), including cords, are decent quality for the price, and fit slim. [Other items](http://i.imgur.com/fs0pd.jpg) like [flannel shirts](http://i.imgur.com/bHhp8.jpg) are also good, though some items stray into poorly stylized or gaudy territory. [Unique socks](http://i.imgur.com/eRuJ0.jpg) have been a staple of Mossimo for about a year now, and for ~$3 a pair you can have dinosaurs, stripes, and other awesome things on your feet. They aren't Richer Poorer quality, but they beat H&amp;M easily, and can up your sock game on the cheap. 

Other items of note: [Cords that are $20-$25, and come in lots of colors](http://i.imgur.com/KZW2B.jpg), or [this kick-ass camo shirt](http://i.imgur.com/J6BYt.jpg).

[Full Album of Mossimo Picks](http://imgur.com/a/xCXTG)
 
**Merona** is Target's more formal brand, aimed at everyone from [young professionals](http://i.imgur.com/BmPek.jpg), through [regular professionals](http://i.imgur.com/j6RMS.jpg). Fit is more generous than Mossimo, but not across the board. Merona has plenty of items in ['classic' colors](http://i.imgur.com/rWxGi.jpg), like [navy](http://i.imgur.com/NpLZU.jpg), [tan](http://i.imgur.com/Vvakm.jpg), [grey](http://i.imgur.com/kHiFu.jpg), and [black](http://i.imgur.com/vFJCz.jpg), and of late has added [brighter](http://i.imgur.com/aZnZM.jpg) [colors](http://i.imgur.com/kmWSZ.jpg) to a number of items. They provide an entry-level selection for plenty of [business-casual](http://i.imgur.com/3lZJm.jpg) [items](http://i.imgur.com/1YSM4.jpg), though they also feature a number of Target's ""avoid at all costs"" pieces.
 
A bunch of Merona items feature a ""tailored fit"", which as far as I'm concerned means that they stitched a ""tailored fit"" tag to the item. The same way my 'relaxed thigh and leg' Mossimo pants and not relaxed, Merona is generally not ""tailored"". I'n particular a pair of ""tailored fit"" chinos fit in the waist, and were baggy everywhere else. A [medium sweater](http://i.imgur.com/NLrIX.jpg) may fit too large, and be next to a [medium cardigan](http://i.imgur.com/ekoKe.jpg) that fits perfectly, next to a [medium jacket](http://i.imgur.com/tb0sy.jpg) which fits like a small. Generally *a* size will probably work, but occasionally you'll wish that XS and MS existed in men's at Target.
 
Merona [""Ultimate Dress Shirts""](http://i.imgur.com/O97sP.jpg) get touted on Dappered often, and are decent for the price. Their [peacoats](http://i.imgur.com/CN2A8.jpg) are also good for the price, and actually fit better than many other items in the line. Their [Kensington blazer](http://i.imgur.com/BHlDu.jpg) is a versatile piece that is totally unstructured, and made from decent fabric- but fit can vary color to color, and even piece to piece. There are also [Merona](http://i.imgur.com/Kdha9.jpg) [accessories](http://i.imgur.com/vCc5a.jpg) which are not bad for the price, don't buy the ties though- they're overpriced and unimpressive.

Other items of note: [Twill shirt that is thick enough to be a light jacket](http://i.imgur.com/tzBT4.jpg), [Weekend bag that is extremely attractive for $25-$30](http://i.imgur.com/t7rBv.jpg), [Unique summer belt](http://i.imgur.com/l9ydK.jpg), [$4 beanies that feel like *at least* $8 beanies](http://i.imgur.com/AmRnd.jpg).

[Full Album of Merona Picks](http://imgur.com/a/5xi5C) 

**Converse One Star** is Target's smaller, more ['edgy'](http://i.imgur.com/ImBoW.jpg) brand, pulling inspiration from the [military](http://i.imgur.com/Rr4mS.jpg) and [motorcycles](http://i.imgur.com/Zc3La.jpg). The brand is deliberately intended to be more [casual](http://i.imgur.com/G0f49.jpg), and more [grungy](http://i.imgur.com/leotA.jpg) than Mossimo, and while the styles are more [unique](http://i.imgur.com/EgWiY.jpg), the [colors](http://i.imgur.com/jl68J.jpg) are [muted](http://i.imgur.com/DH5CK.jpg). [Olive](http://i.imgur.com/HcMLx.jpg), [grey](http://i.imgur.com/Cu15H.jpg), [black](http://i.imgur.com/29wTR.jpg), [cream](http://i.imgur.com/acmsN.jpg), and occasionally [browns](http://i.imgur.com/Lblti.jpg) tend to make up most of the Converse line, which can be a bit disappointing, as [brighter colors](http://i.imgur.com/1y5RJ.jpg) would lend themselves awesomely well to some items. As with the other lines, there have been some interesting inclusions in the Converse line, most notably [$30 selvadge jeans](http://i.imgur.com/RBXpg.jpg) in the recent past.
 
Fit in general tends to be a bit big, with tees and henleys fitting larger than same-size Mossimo, and other items sharing some of the size disparity that makes trying items key. An extreme example is this [field coat](http://i.imgur.com/VWvlJ.jpg). A small is actually a little big on me, fitting less close than my medium Uniqlo mountain parka. It's also pretty long, which looks good on my 6'2"" frame, but I imagine a 5'9"" guy weighing 150lbs would be dwarfed in the thing.
 
The cloth on their [shirts](http://i.imgur.com/TDTTB.jpg) is soft and [comfortable](http://i.imgur.com/qcsyw.jpg), with more [character](http://i.imgur.com/IZ3XA.jpg) than either other brand, and the [construction](http://i.imgur.com/UsA5h.jpg) on most items is a bit better too. There have been occasional accessory items under the brand, such as this [weekend bag](http://i.imgur.com/qCIsx.jpg), that aren't bad- though I'd remove branding.

This might not be the best subreddit to ask , but I couldn't think of a better one. 

So here is the situation, I usually wear soft clothed pants (no jeans), and I play sports a lot (so usually shorts, sweatpants, workout pant etc) and many times when I am running or walking with these pants, my dick is slightly visibly sticking out. If my penis was a bit longer, it would have a chance to bulge down so it wouldn't poke out so much, but because I am slightly smaller than average, my penis doesn't have a chance to bulge down so it it pretty much just sticks out straight, making it quite visible on certain types of pants. 

So, would you guys have any recommendation on fashion changes which wouldn't make it as obvious? Or maybe certain types of underwear which force it down, etc? Thanks

Here is a pic to illustrate what I mean by sticking out. (my situation is illustrated on the right)

edit: whenever I wear tight boxer briefs, it doesn't help. If anything, it makes a worse as it just solidifies my dick in that state

edit: Thanks everyone for the advice and laughs. I will try some of the suggestions like trying a jock strap. I will also try another brand/material compression underwear. I seriously wasn't expecting such a response, what an embarrassing way to make it to the front page.

I am a straight male, and I strive to dress well just like the next guy. However, I've noticed how damn well gay men seem to dress. Like exponentially better than I could ever dress. Gay men dress in a way that would make women melt, so why can't us straight men get this figured out? Gay men make fashion look so easy. It's like an art form like drawing or pottery. I can draw a duck or make a bowl like the next guy could, but gay guys are forming masterpieces like it's nothing.

I hope this doesn't offend anyone. I'm really not trying to stereotype anyone. The reason I felt comfortable posting this is that I've never really known gay people to be easily offended. They've always been proud of their culture, and I thought the gay men in this sub would be glad to discuss this.

Edit: Well it seems no one wants to have a real discussion here, rather there is a large disregard for reddiquette. My posts just get immediately downvoted, despite contributing relevant discourse. I'll just go back to lurking. I apologize for mistaking this crowd for those who can set aside minor controversy for the sake of intelligent conversation.

Edit 2: Things have turned around. It seems those that were quick to vilify me as an ignorant bigot have been pushed by the community to the bottom of the thread, and the interesting discussion has risen to the top. There seems to be a good mix of gay and straight men here who consider themselves to dress well, and also a mix of both orientations that feel they could use improvement.

It was inspired by [this comment thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/15qah9/transman_body_shape_fashion/c7oy74b) between /u/jdbee and /u/alilja.  So I decided to see if I couldn't compile a bunch of threads that MFA has seen in the past year or so to show that MFA is more diverse and open-minded than the rest of reddit thinks.

**Why does reddit think this?**

/u/Balloons_lol explains it with an [excellent analogy:](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/15qa3b/simple_questions_dec_31st/c7ozqn0)

&gt;think of it like this. imagine you're in the market for a new chair for your desk. simple enough. last week, you stumbled upon /r/deskchairadvice[1] a while back and saved it, though you never browsed it that thoroughly. well now's the perfect time to ask for some advice.

&gt;so you post a link to the chair you wanted (or in some cases, you've already bought the chair) and say ""Hey guys, what do you think of this chair for my desk?""

&gt;you get downvoted instantly. the criticism are that the color is a dull grey and looks bad, the cushion won't conform to your body as well as a chair 10x as expensive would, you don't get the best possible arch support, it's not made by a japanese guy with a ponytail, etc. suddenly you realize there is a massive subculture about something you put in little to no thought about. ""they're just fucking"" chairs you say, and your comment goes way below threshold.

&gt;then in askreddit you complain about how pretentious these chair people are

&gt;we're just unfortunate in that everyone is forced to wear clothing and nobody wants to feel like they're bad at it. so when they ask for advice and realize they actually dress pretty badly, it's our fault. we're the ones who are wrong. no real man would spend this much time worrying about clothes. you guys are fags. hmph.

**Breaking the Rules:**

MFA has often been criticized as stuck-up and snobby for giving out advice based on a set of ""arbitrary"" and ""unbreakable"" fashion rules.  There's also the idea that MFA ""hates"" certain items.  But that's not true at all.  These ""rules"" aren't set in stone... they're more like guidelines.  In the case of beginners, their outfits often need work, and it's easiest to give them imperative advice in a set of rules and/or a list of things that need to be changed.  Inadvertently, some come out believing that there is a list of fashion rules you can and can't break, and they don't understand how or why these ""rules"" come to be.  Thus, the myth of the fashion ""rulebook"" is perpetuated. /u/Syeknom has a great [blog post](http://fashionandacupoftea.com/on-fashion-rules/) on this.

And as /u/ newgale explains it, ""clothes isnt maths, you dont go 'this plus this equals appeal' and 'this plus this equals shit'"".  To put it another way, the ""rules"" can be broken intentionally in an outfit and work well:

**The Top of WAYWT threads:** 

This is perhaps the best evidence that MFA caters to aesthetics beyond the 'stereotypical' ""peacoat/pointer chore coat + light blue ocdb + khaki chinos/dark selvedge denim + CDB/AE Strand"" that is the ""MFA uniform"". I think /u/reverendglasseye [puts it well:](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/145etr/november_2012_top_of_waywt/c7a4q9w)

And there you have it.  There's a lot to MFA beyond the ""MFA uniform"" that everyone complains about.  Remember that MFA is a beginner's forum, and so a lot of our new users will be directed to the time-tested basics, and often they'll be given a set of rules to help them learn the ropes.  As /u/carmaugh puts it, ""It's like how in sports, you just don't play however you like. One must first learn the rules of the game.""  Or how in music, you should be able to play a scale before you can start playing Mozart.  Teaching the basics of style, in my opinion, is the first great thing that MFA does well. We can help you get a solid footing with a firm grasp on the basics of looking good, and help with simple questions and fit checks.


But developing a good aesthetic and sense of style is something that cannot be spoon-fed.  Just like how you haven't gained anything if you rely on having people tell you what to think of a new book; you can't look good if you don't understand how your clothes work together, and you can't improve yourself if you're continually reliant on the opinions of others.  This is where the second great thing about MFA comes in.  We provide the resources to help people find their own sense of style. The many in-depth guides are a great way to truly understand and analyze different aesthetics, from goth ninja to the simple [sweatshirt](http://redd.it/15v5ya).  We have an incredible amount of diversity, and the WAYWTs and inspiration albums are a great place to find inspiration. 

There's lots of good advice given for a variety of styles. That's what MFA is about.

Some things:

 * Use the ""Next"" button at the bottom to submit your vote.  

 * Obsurvey limits responses to one per IP address, but let's have an honor code and limit it to one per user.

 * I randomized the order of the nominees.  Ideally it would be a different randomization for each respondent, but this is the best we can do with a free widget.

 * According to [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof2012/comments/14cj96/greetings/), the winners will get Reddit Gold.  I don't know when or for how long, but still, This Is Serious Internet Business.

 * No campaigning at the polling place.  Any comments encouraging/discouraging votes for any candidate will have to be removed.

1364830342.0,1546,self.malefashionadvice,1bfdtt,"Alternate Summer Shoe: Crocs, The Most Versatile Shoe In The World.",5139,3593,319,http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/1bfdtt/alternate_summer_shoe_crocs_the_most_versatile/,"[Crocs,](http://i.imgur.com/jvK2iFo.jpg) long a staple of American and European fashion, are an excellent, easy way to up your shoe game. Ever since 2002, Crocs' unique, ""ultra-hip Italian styling"" has been revered by such fashion giants as Tim Gunn. Crocs are, arguably, the most versatile shoe on the planet: They are at home in streetwear, prep, workwear, and even goth ninja. 

Take a look at [this streetwear fit.](http://i.imgur.com/D3nb7Md.jpg) Already, the pairing of the silver vest with the black tshirt and loose pants is on point; this is streetwear at its highest level. However, as next level as this fit is from the ankles up, what really makes it is the masterful shoe pairing. This is a great example of how to work Crocs into your personal style: in this outfit, they are both subtle and daring, the focus of attention and a smooth complement to an already cohesive outfit. If you're feeling really daring with your choice of shoes and want to jump on the collab hype train but can't quite afford copping those Supreme x Vans, I'd suggest the far more versatile, artisan [Batman x Crocs] (http://i.imgur.com/m8QGqmwh.jpg) collab for an easy, comfortable, and, above all, sharp look. I wouldn't be surprised if sneakerheads threw out their needlessly expensive, needlessly ugly CPs and Air Jordans within two years in favor of the far more versatile, far more fashionable Croc. 

Crocs and preppy styles go together like Uniqlo OBCDs and Timex Weekenders. Few and far between are shoes that work so well in such different contexts, but Crocs [achieve this goal easily.](http://i.imgur.com/TLbirSn.jpg) Though we all wish we could walk around wearing nothing but Crocs when we see such beautiful shoes and the lust and passion for refined fashion fills our hearts, it's important to remember how to pair such beautiful shoes. [This outfit](http://i.imgur.com/xo95HlC.jpg) is a great example of how to use Crocs in a preppy outfit: observe the tasteful pairing with the ""le classy"" hat and the washed-out denim jacket. However, we can go even simpler. [This snapshot](http://i.imgur.com/j7vmDvu.jpg) from the Crocs catalog itself perfectly embodies the spirit of what Crocs will help you achieve in a preppy outfit: it's casual, comfortable, fun, and, above all, dapper as hell.

Crocs are so versatile they will even blend effortlessly into your ""nxtlvl"" goth ninja style. Take a look at the gentleman on the right side of [this picture:](http://i.imgur.com/yqqqxs4.jpg) he's pulling a classic goth ninja look. The drapes on the ~~ill-fitting~~ nxtlvl black pants and the smooth lines of the black t-shirt juxtaposed with the straighter (yet still loose) lines of the black blazer make this classic look. The Crocs in this outfit are a beautiful addition: they breathe excitement, youth, comfort, and new life into an already-classic look. Forget black Doc Martens, Crocs will take you far beyond nxtlvl into the realm of StyleZeitgeist heaven.

Crocs' versatility, comfort, and timeless fashion have won me over in the recent years. I suggest you all reconsider next time you walk by a store with Crocs; they may just end up being the best purchase you ever make.",,False,self,t5_2r65t,1364830630.0,,,True,t3_1bfdtt,http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/1bfdtt/alternate_summer_shoe_crocs_the_most_versatile/,

*by Renalan*

**PREFACE**
*****
With over 50,000 subscribers, it was high time for another update.  Now with reduced vulgarity and expanded options and ideas for the introductory wardrobe.

This guide applies to **all** ages, body types, social standings, or self-perceived personal archetypes.  This guide lists the basics and fundamentals of the mens wardrobe and will point to some budget-minded options for this.  Read this guide understanding that a lot of noobs can't afford $150 shirts.  Remember though, generally, you get what you pay for.

**Fit is king**, nothing can make cheap clothes look better like a good fit, and conversely, nothing can make expensive clothes look cheap like a bad fit.  Tagged clothing size varies widely by manufacturer, a small isn't always a small and a large might be a medium.  

Check out the guide to ['How Clothes Should Fit']( http://redd.it/ehrtv) for more info.

**SECTION I – PANTS**
*****
**Jeans** - The blue jean is a classic part of American workwear and a staple to any man’s wardrobe you can imagine.  Anyone can wear these.  Stick with a dark indigo wash.  Avoid bootcut jeans, nobody has calves that flare out larger than their thighs. 

* [**Levi’s 511** – Clean Dark - $39.99](http://amzn.com/B004D4Y42Y) – Slim fitting, tapered leg for the skinnier guy.
* [**Levi’s 508** – Rigid Envy - $39.99](http://amzn.com/B0051712UO) – Very similar to the 511, but with more room through the thigh, but still retaining the taper past the knee.  Recommended for athletic guys.
* [**Levi’s 501** – Clean Rigid - $42.99](http://amzn.com/B0018ON68A) – The 'original' denim cut, the cut has grown larger throughout the years.  The original 501 fit closer to what the 511 is today.  These are more suited for guys with bigger legs.

**Chinos** - Colloquially known as 'khakis', khaki is the color and chino was the material originally used.  Levi's makes trousers in most of their jean cuts in varying colors.  As a beginner, avoid cargo pockets and pleats.  Flat front pants are much more flattering.

* [**Dockers Alpha Khaki** - $39.99](http://amzn.com/B004VQBJFE) – These fit slim, close to the 511, black is less versatile than you think, consider navy or the earth tones.
* [**Dockers D1 Slim Fit** - $39.99](http://amzn.com/B002AQ23G6) - These fit like 514s, a bit tight in the seat and straight past the knee.  Black is less versatile than you think, consider navy or the earth tones.

**Cords** -  AKA Corduroy pants.  Lots of people wear these as kids.  Again, the fit rules that apply to jeans also apply here.  Make sure the wales (the thin strips) are small.  Levi's makes a lot of these in their jean cuts for similar prices.

**Shorts** -  Avoid cargo pockets.  Slim, plain front shorts work well during the summer and hotter months.  Check out J. Crew Factory and Land's End Canvas for some budget options.

**SECTION II – THE SHIRT**
*****
Someone said that a shirt’s collar frames the face, which is important because people look at your face.  For this reason I prefer V-necks over crew necks.  Graphic tees you ask?  Wear them at your own risk, they generally give off an air of immaturity.

* [**Mossimo V-Neck Tees** - $7.99](http://goo.gl/urp1m) – Multiple colors – you can find these at target, they’re slim fitting and v-necked. 
* **Similar Tees from LEC**: [**Crew**](http://bit.ly/FPG19C) and [**V**](http://bit.ly/uxw6GF)
There are however other shirts available too, collared button down shirts.  Learn to like collared shirts, they can really make your image more mature.
* [**LEC Polos** - $9.99](http://bit.ly/wU9GFg) – Multiple colors, another basic, less versatile than collared button downs.

**Button Ups** – Stick with long sleeved versions for now.  Keep em’ close to the body, off the rack shirts will typically need tailoring.  Thicker and heavier weaves are more casual (oxford and twill) and lighter weaves more formal (poplin and broadcloth).  There are exceptions to these rules, but this is just a guideline.  Make sure your undershirt doesn't show.

* [**Lands End Canvas** - $20-30](http://bit.ly/vlRwtx) – They have sales on all the time, the shirts aren’t the slimmest, but safe.
* **Alfani Red** [**“Dress Shirts”** - $20-$30 - **“Sport Shirts”** - $20-$30](http://bit.ly/x5rRGs)  – These are decent slim shirts on a budget, dress shirts are usually longer and have to be tucked in.  Prices vary between $20-$30 and a lot of sales go on.
* **Bar III** [**“Dress Shirts”** - $30-60](http://bit.ly/zGGGCJ) – More from Macy's, higher quality than Alfani.
* **H&amp;M** - $15-30 - H&amp;M doesn't do e-commerce, but they are a very prevalent mall store and carry many different types of button downs.  They typically range from $15-30, they are generally slim fitting.
* [**J. Crew Factory Button-Ups** - $15-40](http://bit.ly/uA7pnJ) - J. Crew's outlet store,  30% off sales are relatively frequent.  Quality is supposed to be below J. Crew's mainline.  Fits are typically a bit boxy, consider sizing down.

**SECTION III – THE LAYERS**
*****
 “Winter is coming.”  So what do you wear?  I like sweaters and cardigans, maybe a hoodie here or there.  Check out the [**Fall**](http://redd.it/l3lft) or [**Winter**](http://redd.it/mhkqf) Wardrobe guides if you want more info.

* [**Merona V-Neck** - $22.99](http://bit.ly/u5TiDf) – Collars frame the face, same thing from t-shirts applies to sweaters. 
* [**LEC Sweaters, Cardigans** - $20-35](http://bit.ly/u2bLHy) - Cardigans are very versatile for layering.  They definitely give off a more mature vibe than other sweaters.
* [**American Apparel Cardigans** - $20-30](http://bit.ly/xTBdOm) – Simple and basic, what is said above applies.
* [**American Apparel Hoodies** - $20-30](http://bit.ly/Awo6Xx) – Some people say hoodies are immature, but a slim fitting solid hoodie doesn’t really look that bad.  These are for you college kids and youngsters.
* [**J. Crew Factory Knits** - $25-50](http://bit.ly/uapEKT) - Again, sales are frequent.  Check here for cardigans, v-neck and crew neck sweaters.

**SECTION IV – THE SHOES**
*****
Before I learned how to dress myself, I had a pair of ratty ass athletic Nikes, some flip flops and some bulky ass dress shoes.  **What you want to look for is a slim, rounded toebox that accentuates the shape of the feet.  Avoid clunky soles, bulky toeboxes, square/pointed toes and pointless/gaudy stitching.**  Shoes are often the most expensive part of an outfit, so I’m only going over some cheap basics.  

* **Canvas Sneakers** -  [**Converse Chuck Taylor All Star** - $45](http://bit.ly/m8xmJ1) - [**Vans Authentic** - $45](http://bit.ly/s7pK9g) – These are basic low-top canvas sneakers, they usually look good with jeans and other casual outfits.  I recommend Optical White for Chucks and True White for Vans. 
* **Desert Boots** - [**Clarks** - $60-80](http://amzn.to/rFt7iP) – I have developed a loathing for these boots now, but they actually do look decent and I’ll recommend them again.   Beeswax is a good color.  They go well with jeans and chinos.
* **Brown Boots** -[**LL Bean Katahdin Engineer Boots** - $159](http://bit.ly/t5IEHp) - A solid, made in USA no-frills boots.  It doesn't have the sleekest toebox, but it is supposed to be built rugged.  Can stand up to some weather by adding snoseal, but the soles aren't lugged.  Would go great matched with jeans.
* **Wingtips 'Dress Shoes'** - [**Florsheim** - $100+](http://bit.ly/rZ34hs) - The perforations or broguing on these 'dress' shoes make them more casual, allowing them to be suitable for smart casual or upscale casual wear.  They go great with jeans or chinos.  Go for a shade of brown to get the most mileage out of your shoes.

**SECTION V – ACCESSORIES**
*****
Accessories, the little details, sometimes these make an outfit, but leave that to the pros.  Two basic accessories that can work for any man are a belt and a watch.

* [**The Timex Weekender** - $40](http://amzn.to/tAicM4) – Ah, the NATO-strapped Timex.  The hardest circlejerk that MFA has ever experienced, but for good reason.  It’s a good looking watch, with a lot of options for being you in the strap.  Just please don’t post a picture of it when you get one.  Black faces are more casual than white watch faces.
* [**4 STR / 4 STA Leather Belt** - $35](http://bit.ly/slshCg) – I got a decent leather belt from this store on ebay.  The wider the belt the more casual, brown is generally more versatile than black, if you wear leather shoes, try to match the color with your belt.

**CLOSING THOUGHTS**
*****
Here are a few brick and mortar/mall stores which you can easily find some reasonably priced basics in person.

* [**H&amp;M**](http://www.hm.com) - Cheap, fast fashion, clothing is touted to last only one season.
* [**Gap**](http://www.gap.com) - I feel like the design of Gap clothing isn't as nice as some other retailers, but the quality is decent and sales are frequent.
* [**Zara**](http://www.zara.com) - Cheap, fast fashion, higher quality than H&amp;M.
* [**J. Crew Factiory**](http://www.jcrew.com/factory) - J. Crew’s factory line.
* [**Uniqlo**](http://www.uniqlo.com) - Only available in New York, much more availability outside of the US.

Take it slow, check out the guide to [**How to Build A Wardrobe**]( http://redd.it/lnn5k) for some more pointers.

If you're looking for inspiration or ideas, check out how [**MFA's 'Consistent Contributors'**]( http://redd.it/mrxtz) dress or check out how MFA's general readership dresses in our [**semi-weekly What Are You Wearing Today threads**](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/search?q=waywt&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on).

That’s it for now.  These are just some basics, something to point you towards dressing better.  The initial cost of dressing better might be high, but there’s a high return on investment here.  Dressing well gives you confidence and with confidence, the world is your oyster.",,False,self,t5_2r65t,1339913296.0,,,True,t3_mu2zu,http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/mu2zu/the_basic_wardrobe_30/,

There have been some Reddit MFA threads about Allen Edmonds shoes lately and my college-aged son, Mark, suggested I should do an AMAA with you.  He floated the idea in an earlier message and a couple hundred men seemed interested.  We're always looking for direct customer interaction, so it seems a great idea to me.  I'll be online starting at about 1 pm today until 3pm.   Then I'll come back on over the weekend sometime and Monday to answer remaining questions. Anything related to shoes, manufacturing, Made in USA, Allen Edmonds 90 year history, men's fashion trends, regional differences, career advice... whatever ... I'd be happy to answer.  

Thanks for your interest!  

**EDIT:** Here's a photo verifying my identity. Link [here](http://imgur.com/BMoxe)

**UPDATING**  It's 3:15 and I've got to run.  I've enjoyed the dialogue, I hope you've found it at least a bit interesting.  I'll get back to more of your questions over the weekend...  Thanks again for your support of AE and interest in our company.  Paul
 **UPDATING**  It's 11:41 now and I'm signing off now.  Thanks for your interest.  I'm amazed at the volume of questions.  I'll try to answer them all but it'll be a while...

1315345988.0,1168,self.malefashionadvice,k6uro,How to make a $100 belt on the cheap,1524,356,233,http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/k6uro/how_to_make_a_100_belt_on_the_cheap/,"This guide will show you how to make a [$100 full-grain leather belt](http://www.tannergoods.com/collections/belts) for around $25. In the end, you'll have a higher quality leather belt than the cardboard, bonded, or genuine leather* belts purchased at most mall-brand stores. The belt made here will develop a nice patina and could easily last you the rest of your life. 

Beginning leathercraft is very simple and easy to get into. You probably have a leather goods store in your area. Tandy Leather Factory is a nationwide chain (also in Canada and the UK), due to their ubiquity, I'll link them for anything that needs to be bought.


Things you'll need to buy.

* [Belt blank $10](http://www.tandyleatherfactory.com/en-usd/home/department/Leather-Belts-Leather-Straps/44518-186.aspx). You can use any width but 1.5"" is the max width for most of my jeans' belt loops. Make sure you buy a full-grain, vegetable-tanned leather blank. 

* [Belt buckle $1-20](http://www.tandyleatherfactory.com/en-usd/home/department/Buckles/Utility-Buckles/Utility-Buckles.aspx). Use any buckle you want. Get one from a vintage store or online. The width of the buckle and the belt blank need to be the same. 

* [(optional) Belt keep of matching width $1](http://www.tandyleatherfactory.com/en-usd/home/department/Leather-Belts-Leather-Straps/4600-04.aspx). You can get a metal belt keep, a leather one, or get a buckle that doesn't need a keep. 

* [(optional) All-in-one water based dye $9](http://www.tandyleatherfactory.com/en-usd/home/department/Liquids-N/Dyes-Antiques/2605-133.aspx). This is a good dye for beginners. It won't rub off on clothing or skin after the dye has dried (about 24 hours). Forego the dye if you want a natural or nude colored belt. 

*  If you don't already have a rotary punch, you should buy one. It will pay for itself with just one use.

**PSA against genuine leather:** Genuine leather is not synonymous with authentic or real leather. Genuine leather is actually a grade of leather. In fact, it's the second worst grade of leather (the worst being bonded leather). Don't buy genuine leathers and expect them to last more than one or two seasons. Read [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leather) or [Saddleback Leather Company's Leather 101](http://www.saddlebackleather.com/18-why-saddleback-leather-is-better) for more information.

There are a couple things MFA'ers always complain about having to do with the community on this subreddit.

1. The Hivemind/MFA uniform that many people say decreases the amount of creativity and the diversity of styles in the subreddit.  
2. A heavy focus on the basics of fit and style that can leave some of the more daring and experienced members feeling underwhelmed.  
  
What I'd like to do is have a weekly fashion challenge post with a theme that challenges posters to shake things up a bit and put their stylistic skills to the test. For example, one thread could require posters to break a commonly held MFA rule (like the contentious tie-no-jacket), one could be to go against a fashion faux-pas (brown on black etc.), one could be required to prominently feature a graphic tee and so on and so forth with as many as we can think of.   
In order to keep it organized, we'd have to have one person post the thread at the same time every week so we don't have an overflow of shitty threads that kill the idea. I'd be happy to do it myself or give over control to a mod.

**TL;DR: Should have weekly ""best dressed"" competitions that require posters to break rules or go out on a limb**


EDIT: Ok it seems like most people like the idea so far. How about tomorrow I post the first one around noon and let it go from there. I'll just be a dictatorial cunt and pick ""Rock and Roll"" as the first theme. Wear what you'd wear to a rock concert, or on stage playing in one. Band T-shirts absolutely allowed. Let's get some cool shit going for tomorrow. I'll post a new thread.

### Shape/Length/Type/Size

---

A [diagram](http://i.imgur.com/qsmuo6x.jpg) ^[via](http://www.mcgregorsocks.com/sock_facts.html) mostly for the silhouettes, as ballpark discussion examples. Not definitive.

#### Standard socks

* over-the-calf / dress / long / tall / knee-high / executive / full-length socks
* mid-calf / crew / half-length socks
* ankle / anklet / sport / short / quarter-length socks

Formal attire traditionally requires long/dress socks (to prevent any flashes of visible skin, and because they're less prone to bunching/falling).


#### Unseen Socks

* no-show / liner / loafer / invisible / ped / low / footie socks

The Naming of unseen socks is **wildly non-standard**. Socks named ""no-show"" might be anything from [minimal](http://i.imgur.com/Pnqgte9.jpg) ([C.K.s](http://www.amazon.com/Calvin-Klein-Mens-Liner-Socks/dp/B007KZ2IHG/)) all the way up to the [ankle bone](http://i.imgur.com/YHyDCzo.png) ([Hanes](http://www.hanes.com/clothing/men/socks/low-cut---no-show-socks)).

See this comparison of 2 ""invisible"" brands, [without shoes](http://i.imgur.com/FPUlJAD.jpg) and [with shoes](http://i.imgur.com/vxBj4Bv.jpg). ^[via](http://www.makethman.com/2011/05/20/loafers-and-the-invisible-sock-dilemma/)

---
### Material

---

* **Get Wool**: Good moisture wicking. Good temperature control. Good durability. - Some people find/think of them as itchy; getting good quality (fine/ultrafine) wool, and blends with other materials, can solve this in most cases. The coarse fibers, are the ones that itch - which is more of a problem/memory of vintage/hand-me-down/heirloom wool, or cheap wool.
* **Be careful with cotton**: Cotton is moisture-absorbant (not wicking), so if your feet are hot, and/or sweaty, they'll smell worse by day's end. Cotton is less durable, and less springy once compressed, compared to wool. Cheap cotton socks are prolific, and often badly shaped/cut/stitched. This has led to the opinion that [Cotton sucks for socks.](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/17l7zg/guide_request_socks/c86jwdd). Keep this in mind, and you'll be fine.
* **Blends are good**. An addition of *x* can add good properties to the material (elasticity, durability, etc). See [this Material guide](http://www.hisroom.com/sock-fibers,308,30.html), which covers: acrylic, cotton, linen, nylon, polyester, rayon, silk, spandex(lycra), wool. 

If layering, use synthetic/wool/wicking materials for the inner layer. Some ""[liner](http://www.rei.com/product/737999/rei-coolmax-liner-socks)"" socks are named/designed for this purpose (versus no-show-""liners"").

SmartWool is just a brand of [merino](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merino) sheep wool, treated with a few of the ""washable wool"" processes (invented in the '70s); specifically, a heavy washing of the raw fibers, and a resin coating. It turns these [rough raw edges](http://i.imgur.com/Gdi34vx.jpg), into this [smoother surface](http://i.imgur.com/tpOZAL1.jpg), to prevent the fibres catching on each other as they move around, which is why untreated-wool ""shrinks"". Many other companies do the same thing.

---
### Color/Pattern

---

* **Basic/Daily/Standard**: Match your pant color, or go one shade **darker** - this will look naturally good, both by being shadow-like, and extending your leg thereby making you look taller. (If you match your shoe color, it can give your shoe the illusion of being a deformed boot. Badbadbad.)

    I.e. Dark grey/blue/brown socks with denim/navy pants. Dark brown/grey/blue socks with khaki pants. Thin black socks only with black or dark-grey pants (Never thick black gym socks.). Never white, unless you're exercising (or going Californian^[1](http://stylegirlfriend.com/sock-iquette-guide-guys-footwear/)). 
* **Intermediate**: Compliment (not clash) the color of your pants. Use solid colors, or minimal patterns. See the sidebar's ""Understanding Color"". [E.g.](http://i.imgur.com/XsRSB.jpg) and [E.g.2](http://img.tapatalk.com/6c03ae03-d9c9-c9b5.jpg) ^[via](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/ydgll/not_a_huge_fan_of_the_socks_must_match_trousers/) [E.g.3](http://i.imgur.com/7slr5NN.jpg)
* **Advanced**: Be Bold. Experiment. Match the color of your tie/shirt/eyes/pocketsquare/SO's outfit/etc. 

    This [can](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/ktahl/i_have_a_guilty_pleasure_to_confess_but_as_they/) rapidly [get](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/hy2zq/picked_up_my_first_batch_of_loud_socks_whaddya/) quite [extensive](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/iebl6/mfa_its_time_to_post_your_sock_collections_ill/), expensive, or [crazy](http://www.reddit.com/r/secretsanta/comments/18vcg6/this_is_for_my_santa_who_may_be_poststalking_most/).

    Advanced because: It can easily go horribly wrong, and come-off as ""tryinghardandfailing"". Block colors are easier to make [work](http://i.imgur.com/snnsDlZ.jpg).^[via](http://tcgstyle.com/2013/01/15/the-winter-cabin-weekend/) Patterns are just [asking](http://i.imgur.com/FujFcE2.jpg) for [trouble](http://i.imgur.com/f6Ser5A.jpg).

*Caveat*: Bright/Loud/Silly/Novelty socks will get commented on, but sometimes ""*hey, nice socks*"" really means ""*I couldn't help but notice your incredibly garish socks, and politely comment on them to cover my laughter and staring. Are you color-blind or going to clown-school?*""

---
### Size

---

* Not Too Tight. One size does NOT fit all. Buy a trial pair of any new sock brand/model, to confirm that a day's wear will not strangle your ankles, or wriggle down into your shoe. Typically, your real sock size is 1 or 2 times larger than your shoe size. YMMV.

---
### Care

---

* Washing: For high quality socks, Hang Dry. Read the label when/before you buy them. (Most fall into the ""Machine-wash warm, Tumble-dry medium"" category. But Tumble-dry with heat destroys the elastic, and deforms the knit. For longer life: hand wash, and always hang dry.)
* Storage: Folding or Rolling, is better than stretching the cuff over itself. Get [obsessive/creative](http://www.google.com/search?q=sock+drawer+organized&amp;tbm=isch) if you wish.
* Stop wearing socks once damage is visible.
* Use old socks as rags, polishers, dusters. They fit well over the hand! (See this [list of materials](http://science.howstuffworks.com/transport/engines-equipment/vdg1.htm) to learn how to add a static charge to each, to make your own swiffer-esque rags.)

---
### Sockless

---
For dry and clean feet:

* Avoid wearing the same pair of shoes for two days in a row. **Air them out**. (Good advice, even when worn with socks.)
* Try wool (moisture-wicking) or terrycloth (moisture-absorbant) insoles. Wash them regularly.
* Try a light daily dusting of goldbond foot powder (but beware barefoot footprints, and dust-out regularly).
* Try an unvarnished-cedar shoe-tree.

To prevent blisters from new shoes:

* Break-in stiff/new shoes with socks (around your home)

### Qs/FAQs

---

* Need moar padding? 

    Get an insole. Really thick socks are only for winter, or exercise, or boots.^[2](http://agoodman.com.au/sock-it-to-me/) 

* [Falling down / Bunching up around the ankle?](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/18ykji/my_socks_wont_stop_bunching_up_help/) 

    Well-made/designed/fitted socks, of any size, will help. Machine-drying will destroy the elastic and knit. Over-the-calf socks are less prone to falling down. Don't tumble-dry, especially with heat.

* Boat/summer shoes look 1000 times better with no-shows or sockless. They were designed for wet/sandy/dusty circumstances; socks are contraindicated.
* Socks with Shorts? Generally [avoid](http://www.google.com/search?q=socks+with+shorts+men&amp;tbm=isch), if fashion is the priority. If necessity demands, then at least keep them short. (Unless you're [Bermudan](http://www.google.com/search?q=bermuda+socks&amp;tbm=isch), or impersonating a [tourist](http://www.flickr.com/photos/mikepmiller/6991739246/))

I've read the sidebar, but I still have a few questions regarding buying, colors, shoes, and a few other things.",1703,597,842,http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/1c4x1f/prom_is_coming_up_in_about_a_month_and_ive/,"**Budget**

I haven't held a steady job this school year, so my funds are running a little low. Thankfully, my parents are fronting the money for the suit and are allowing me to work off the cost of everything (we're splitting it 50/50). That being said, I'm fairly limited on how much I can spend on a suit, shirt, tie, and shoes. If I were to make an estimate right now, I'd say that I have about $250 for the suit, $100-$150 for shoes, and about $100-$120 for a shirt, tie, and possibly a pocket square.

I'd really love to get at least my jacket and pants from J. Crew, Brooks Brothers, or Nordstrom, but I'm not really sure I can convince my parents to allow me to spend the extra money. I've already tried convincing my mother that the suits are probably going to last longer and fit better if I buy them from a higher end store, but she won't really have any of it. So unless there's a surefire way to change her mind, I pretty much have to go to Macy's or J.C. Penny. I understand that both stores are pretty good for the prices, so I'm not going to fuss about it. Just in case though, are there any other retailers I should look at? I live in Central Ohio, so I'm guessing that my options are fairly limited. I've also given Indochino a look, but I've seen mixed reviews in the past on the fits of their jackets. Plus, I'd rather only rely on online ordering if I absolutely have to. So first question, should I broaden my search before actually buying?

**Color**

Since the event is prom, I'd like to compliment my date's dress as much as possible. She's going with a pinkish color that's rather bright. It's hard to describe, honestly. I'll post a picture of the color later if I can. 

For the color of my suit, I'm thinking a grey. Not sure if I want a lighter or darker grey, but I'm leaning towards a lighter shade. For the color of my tie and shirt, I'm thinking a white shirt with a black skinny tie. I'm not sure about the colors though, honestly. If at all possible, I'd like to get a pocket square too. Should I just go with a plain white? Or could I get a color that matches my date's dress?

Overall, the one thing I'm really worried about is the color of my shirt and tie. I'd really like to get that figured out.

**Style**

I don't know too much about what kind of style I should buy. I know I want a two button jacket and pants without pleats (this is a rule, right?). I'm not sure about what kind of lapels I should look for. I'm thinking I'll just get two center vents, just because that seems to be fairly stylish.

I'm thinking of going with something slimmer (I'm 6'1"" 160 lbs.) if that helps.

Should I be making a big deal about the material of the suit? I honestly have no idea what I should go with, even after reading the guide. 

**Shoes**

I'm thinking of a brown pair of shoes just because they're much more versatile for other outfits than black is. I have no idea what brands I should be looking at though. I'd love to buy a pair of Allen Edmond's, even if secondhand, but I doubt I could afford them anyways.

**Belt** 

Should I match the color of my belt to my shoes?  

I think that covers everything. I'll be glad to clear anything up if needed. Thanks!

**EDIT:** I have no problem being a little fashion forward, considering that I'll probably be one of the few kids wearing a suit at the dance. So I'll be open to just about anything.

**EDIT:** Well, this blew up way more than I've ever expected. Thanks for all of the advice and donations to those of you who offered! I'll certainly make a follow up post on the suit when I recieve it, and I'll do another follow up after prom if anyone is interested!",,False,self,t5_2r65t,1365732374.0,,,True,t3_1c4x1f,http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/1c4x1f/prom_is_coming_up_in_about_a_month_and_ive/,

1369260804.0,1064,self.malefashionadvice,1ev3vm,Beginner's Explanations: The color Navy,1396,332,143,http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/1ev3vm/beginners_explanations_the_color_navy/,"In an effort to educate some of newer members of our sub I'm going to start doing in depth explanations of topics that are probably very simple to more experienced members of MFA. Today I'll be doing the color navy.

**History**

The color navy originated with the British Royal Navy in the mid 1700s when it was first used as a color of their uniforms, which originally were a dark blue (not yet called navy) and contrasting white. It was soon adopted by other navies around the world.

**Usage in Menswear**


Navy is and has been a staple of menswear for many years because of its versatility in the common man's wardrobe. The reason it is so common is because men's fashion is very skewed towards [earth tones](http://bobby-lin.com/parsons/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/COLOURlovers.com-Muted_Earth_Tones.png). Earth tones are typically defined as soft, unoffending colors easily found in nature. For more information on this check out the [color guide](http://redd.it/15tjgv) which is also located in the sidebar. Navy blends [very](http://imgur.com/a/WxS79) [well](http://i.imgur.com/Rs2tlOv.jpg) [with](http://imgur.com/hXgpYRf) [earth](http://imgur.com/IfNjau5) [tones](http://i.imgur.com/kVlGjY2.jpg?1). 

Furthermore navy is a very unoffending color in itself, which also makes it easy to match with just about anything. It works in monochrome [outfits](http://i.imgur.com/Vdx1tQt.jpg) or can be used as a background color for [louder](http://imgur.com/a/2ZRTV) fits.

A word of note, navy isn't a single shade. [These](http://www.sewingstudio.com/2012-2013/KNITS/Navy_5.jpg) [could](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_b3zZYpJPKZ8/SvKDtoi6yKI/AAAAAAAAAcI/D7FmghTWGCE/s400/navy-blue.jpg) [all](http://newspaper.li/static/25ac570933ea9c15665069b845eb4853.jpg) [be](http://store.magnafabrics.com/img-dark_navy.jpg) [considered](http://gallery.imprintsconnect.com/var/albums/Dickies/Color-Swatches/DK_SWATCH_Dark-Navy-1097802049.jpg?m=1364849037) [navy](http://paintisdead.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Hexis_Lighrt-Navy-Blue-Matte1-350x350.jpg). It's not a huge deal, but I felt it was worth mentioning.

**Why is it used over black?**

I'm sure you've all heard the ""rule"" that black goes with everything. I'm here to tell you that navy goes better with most things black does. Some of this I suppose is a push by the fashion community to get rid of this rule to some extent. Another reason is that black is seen as very, very formal nowadays (Black tie events, funerals, etc.) To me, though, the biggest reason navy is more versatile than black is because it is less stark. Take a look at this [picture](http://imgur.com/XhorcCs) versus a similar [picture](http://imgur.com/QgqAP6Y). Notice how the lessened amount of contrast allows for an easier look on the eyes. This makes navy more desirable for the beginner just learning color theory or trying to dress well.

Making the case for 5-7"" inseams.",1664,622,784,http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/1fshvu/shorts_should_be_shorts_making_the_case_for_57/,"[The shorts guide /u/elijha wrote for the sidebar](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/1968m0/a_better_shorts_guide/)  is solid, and since summer's in full swing across most of the US, I wanted to both draw attention to it and expand on the logic for wearing shorts that are shorter than many folks are used to.  A 5-7"" inseam will hit 3-6"" above most guys' knees, and while that's not a length that will work for everyone, I'd like to see more of you giving it a try.  (For what it's worth, [I practice what I preach](http://imgur.com/a/P6MNX).)

Let me briefly outline three reasons.  [I also pulled a short album together of shorts done well - ](http://imgur.com/a/OcgoR)

 * **Function.**    Shorts, by definition, are a functional piece of clothing.  You're only wearing them because it's *hot*, right?  It's 80, 90, *100+* degrees, and pants feel unbearable.  If exposing skin to cool off is the goal, [why stop at half-pants?](http://i.imgur.com/zfVMXqq.jpg)  

 * **Aesthetics.**  In my opinion, clothes should follow and reflect the lines of your body (acknowledging, of course, that there are some styles where doing the opposite of this is a deliberate choice).  [Shorts that cover the knee](http://i.imgur.com/RIvotyT.jpg) are a wide hem at the narrowest point of your lower body, when what you want is just the opposite. Counterintuitively, this means longer shorts make scrawny legs look even skinnier.  Longer shorts also visually shorten your legs, and make them look truncated and stumpy.  Shorts that show the quadricep head ([vastus medialis](http://i.imgur.com/En6o3mD.jpg)) on the other hand, make your legs look longer and stronger [(even if they aren't really either of those).](http://i.imgur.com/t4FbMZ7.jpg)

 * **Confidence.**  Past discussions about shorts on MFA have involved a fair amount of body-shaming and stereotyping - ""no one wants to see man-thigh"", ""lol I'm not gay,"" and so on.  That's really too bad.  Context and your social circle matter of course, but there's something to be said for being confident and wearing what works instead of being cowered by silly fears and shallow stereotypes.

This guide is for the men who know very little about fragrances and wish to know a little bit and have two or three go-to fragrances that will be good for several years and cover any occasion. 


**(1) What is the difference between ""cologne"", ""eau de toilette"", and ""perfume""?**

 These three titles differentiate between the different concentration of oils in the fragrance. Eau de toilette is the most common, and most of what men call ""cologne"" is actually eau de toilette. The concentration breakdown is roughly


Cologne ~ 5%

Eau de Toilette ~ 10% 

Perfume ~ 15%



**(2) What types of fragrances are there?**



Fragrances break down into two types: designer and niche.
 


Designer fragrances are the most common. These are the fragrances made by companies like Armani, Chanel, Burberry, and other designer brands. A typical designer fragrance will cost between $50 and $100. These fragrances tend to be mass-produced, and are designed to be sold to many people. They're made to have as wide of an appeal as possible, and so are typically safer than niche fragrances. Because these fragrances are mass-produced, they tend to be made from cheaper materials.



A niche fragrance is typically made from more expensive/higher-quality ingredients. Companies in the niche fragrance game make their fragrances for a more selective customer who wishes to wear something more bold or unique. These fragrances will not have the universal appeal that designer fragrances will have. Instead, these fragrances are made to push the boundaries of acceptable scents, and they often define what will be ""in fashion"" several years down the road. What runway fashion is to clothing, niche fragrances are to fragrances. These fragrances will typically cost more than $250. Because these fragrances are so bold and expensive, they are not what the typical man is looking for in a scent, and so this list will not mention them again. 



From there, designer fragrances can often be broken down into spring/summer fragrances and fall/winter fragrances. Depending on what notes are in the fragrance, the scent might not be able combat the harsh winters, and so it won't jump off your skin. On the other hand, wearing a scent that is too sweet or has too many spices in it during hot days will often make people nauseous. 



**(3) The break down of a fragrance:**



Fragrances break down into three sets of notes (the ingredients/scents which give the fragrance its smell): the top, middle, and base notes. The base notes lay the foundation for the fragrance and will determine how long the fragrance lasts on your skin. The middle and base notes are then extra layers of scents which give the fragrance its unique smell. The top notes tend to last for 1 to 2 hours, the middle notes for 3 to 5 hours, and the base notes ten to last from 5 to 10 hours. As the notes dry up, the scent will change, allowing for the scents to evolve and be more interesting. Typically (but not always for sure) the mark of a low-quality fragrance is if it remains monotone throughout its life. 



Typical base notes are sandalwood, vetiver, vanilla, tar, tobacco, and musk notes. 
Typical top and middle notes are various floral scents, fruity scents, marine/aquatic notes, and spices such as cinnamon. 



**(4) How to distinguish between a high quality fragrance and a low quality fragrance:**



There are several key factors in determining whether a fragrance is good. They are longevity, projection, and uniqueness of the scent. Longevity and projection are important for obvious reasons. If people are unable to smell you (even when close), then what is the point of wearing anything?



A good summer fragrance will not last as long as most winter fragrances typically because they are made from the more natural aquatic/citrusy notes. These notes tend to evaporate within five hours. A good summer fragrance should last you around five to seven hours. 



Winter fragrances, on the other hand, have much harsher base notes that tend to last much longer. A good winter fragrance can last upwards of ten hours. 



When looking for a fragrance to purchase, make sure to wear some on your wrist for a day to check its longevity. Spraying on paper will only reveal the top notes, and is not a good indicator for how the notes will mix with your body oils (determining subtle changes in the scents and longevity). 



Uniqueness of a scent is often overlooked by most men. Your clothes are an outward expression of how you view yourself. The same goes for fragrances. Different scents carry different vibes, and knowing these vibes and choosing accordingly matters. Also, people remember scents well (especially women), and so if you are wearing scents that are unremarkable or common, you'll smell like everyone else. 



**(5) What are some good designer fragrances?**


Burberry- Brit, London



Bvlgari-Aqua, Black, and Man



Carolina Herrera- 212 Men



Chanel- Allure Homme, Allure Homme Sport, Bleu, Platinum Egioste



Christian Dior- Fahrenheit



Davidoff- Cool Water


Diesel- Fuel for Life, and Only the Brave (strictly for younger men though)



Dolce &amp; Gabbana- The One, and Por Homme


Hugo Boss- Boss Bottled (Boss #6)



Givenchy- Pi, Play, and Play Intense


Gucci- Por Homme




Issey Miyake- L'eau D'Issey Por Homme




Jean Paul Gaultier- Le Male




Joop!- Joop! Homme



Lancome- Hypnose



Paco Rabanne- One Million, Por Homme




Serge Lutens- Chergui




Thierry Muglier- Anything, but A*men is my favorite winter fragrance




Tom Ford- Grey Vetiver



Versace- The Dreamer, Eau Fraiche



Viktor and Rolfe- Spicebomb (I've only tried this once, but I enjoyed it).



Yves Saint Laurent- L'Homme and La Nuit de L'Homme, Live Jazz, Kurous, Body Kurous




Please note that this list is very short, and is obviously missing most quality fragrances. I advise you to do some research (watch Youtube reviews and read online articles) before you actually buy something. Do not trust the retailers. They typically do not know much besides what is popular and are trying to sell you a product (not necessarily a good one.)


I recommend watching online reviews. Two reviewers that I like are 
[Mark](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rur2b07inPI) and [Tim](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGSQqPqW2jY). Both of them give very in-depth reviews. By watching their videos, you can get a sense of what is out there and become more familiar with the different types of fragrances. 


**(6) What are some companies to stay away from?**



Armani- There are only two Armani fragrances worth looking into: Aqua di Gio and Code. Both of these have been in the top sellers list since their inception. They are not bad necessarily, but they're too common and for the price you can do better. Armani fragrances are typically expensive, and its not necessarily reflected in the quality of their fragrances. You are buying a name/popularity with this brand.



Calvin Klein-Their colognes flat out suck. They are not unique, and they dry off the skin much faster than a respectable fragrance should. There are stories of these fragrances leaving the skin only an hour after being applied.  



The high school companies- These companies are Abercrombie and Hollister. These fragrances arn't low quality, but you'll smell like you belong in an algebra classroom if you wear them. If you are in high school, please avoid smelling like everyone else. 

**(7) Where do I buy fragrances and where can I get samples?**




Please buy your fragrances from a reputable dealer. Rip-offs are rampant and are often made from inferior ingredients that can be dangerous when applied to the skin.




With that in mind, online retailers often do have considerably cheaper prices. I often by my fragrances at [fragrancenet](http://www.fragrancenet.com/). They are good about selling only genuine products, and once you find a fragrance you like you can order it there to save a couple bucks. 




In terms of samples, it's difficult to find some online. Your best option is to simply go to a Nordstrom's or Macy's and ask for a sample yourself. Stores like Sephora or Perfumania will also have samples that you can either buy cheaply or get for free. 




Fragrances come in many different bottle sizes, but they usually range from 1 oz. to 3.4 oz. If you are new to fragrances, I recommend buying the smaller vials simply because it it is cheaper, you don't know how often you will be wearing it, and your tastes will probably change once you get the chance to smell a lot of different things. You would hate it if you were only a forth of the way through an expensive bottle and you didn't care for it anymore. 



**(8) How much to wear, how to properly store your fragrances:**



You should begin with wearing one or two sprays on the neck. A lot of blood rushes through your neck, and so your body is warmer there, causing the scent to project better. You can add more sprays to your wrists or take sprays away depending on how people react. Remember, you won't be able to smell your fragrance about an hour or two into wearing it. This doesn't mean that it isn't there. So please don't keep reapplying it whenever you can't smell it. 



Spraying a fragrance in the air and walking through it is worthless. Do not spray a fragrance on your clothes. The fragrance isn't allowed to mix with your oils, and hence it can't naturally go through the stages of notes like it should. Also, the oils in a fragrance will stain many fabrics. 



You should store your fragrances in their original boxes, in your bedroom. Rapid heat fluctuations (like found in a bathroom) will cause the molecules in a fragrance to break apart. Sunlight does the same thing as well. Fragrances like constant, dark, dry, and cool environments. Your bedroom will suffice.

1357136511.0,1011,self.malefashionadvice,15tr4k,MFA Contest: New Icon + Sub Description.  Change the face of MFA!  Leave a legacy for future generation! Win Gold!  (please upvote for visibility),1356,345,379,http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/15tr4k/mfa_contest_new_icon_sub_description_change_the/,"[As I announced yesterday,](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/15rttf/announcement_tomorrow_there_will_be_a_contest_to/) we're going to kick off 2013 with a small facelift for MFA.  Since Reddit is a community-generated site, we're turning to the community for ~~free labor~~ help.

In this thread, you can submit your entries for: 

 * **A new icon for the sub header (to replace Snoo in the CDB)**

 * **A new public description for the sub, which shows up when new users search for subs as well as on meta-reddit sites like stattit/redditlist.**

Even if you're not submitting an entry, we hope you'll participate by voting and discussing.  If you're curious about how this works, [see the thread for the new submission warning image from a few months ago.](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/wg1bs/lets_make_the_submission_warning_pretty/)

Here are the details - 

 * Header icons should be 120-200px wide and 40-75px tall, and no more than 100Kb.  Jpeg and png are both fine - animated gifs are not.  Traditionally, header icons incorporate the Reddit alien logo somehow, and they should either say ""Reddit"" or nothing at all (since it's a redirect to the front page).  The icon shouldn't say MFA.  A little about why we're changing it - most big subs update their headers multiple times a year, but more importantly, it's time for our community to make a symbolic move away from worn-out, unfunny CDB inside jokes (which now outnumber actual CDB recommendations about 20:1).   [Here's a starter file for Snoo (the reddit alien) if you want it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/15rttf/announcement_tomorrow_there_will_be_a_contest_to/c7pamcs)

 * The current sub description is, ""Are you a guy who wants to dress better? We can do that.  Are you a lady who wants to help men dress better? We can do that.  Do you just want to look at pictures of well-dressed men? We can do that too.""  It doesn't really reflect the way the community works, and we can definitely do better.  500 characters, max.  Text only - no formatting, links or images.

 * Anyone can enter one or both categories, but if you enter both, please put them in separate posts.  The winners will be decided by a combination of community support (upvotes **and** supportive comments) and moderator discretion.  *Note that the highest-upvoted entries are not automatically the winners.*  The prize is a month of Reddit Gold for the users who submit the winning entries.

Thanks, and happy 2013! 

____

*Note: Sorry for the sad-looking ""please upvote me"" message in the title. I always want to make sure these contest posts reach the MFA subscribers who only see posts on their front page (as opposed to those who visit the sub directly). So please upvote for visibility.

I like [the FAQ format of the current guide](http://tinyurl.com/4x5n3au), but there's a lot it leaves out.  

I've organized this into four sections - (I) sneakers, (II) casual/in-between shoes, (III) dress shoes, and (IV) storage &amp; care.  I won't address boots, since [they have their own guide](http://redd.it/kc9f2).  

I tried to keep budget in mind, but if you're just starting to upgrade your footwear, I realize the cost can be eye-opening.  Well-crafted, high-quality shoes can last for years though, and no one is suggesting that you drop $1200 this weekend.  Invest in your shoe wardrobe slowly, focusing on craftsmanship, durability, and versatility.  A couple days ago, someone asked about a cheaper version of [this pair of blue suede blucher mocs from Oak Street Bootmakers](http://oakstreetbootmakers.com/footwear/navy-suede-red-brick-trail-oxford).  I think my reply is relevant here too - 

&gt;I'm a firm believer in getting what you really want, even if it means saving and waiting. You're not going to be able to wear navy blucher mocs until Spring anyway, so that gives you 3-4 months to save for them. Let's say you could afford $100 right now - I'm sure you can find a way to squirrel away an extra $40/month until May. When spring hits, are you going to regret not having these shoes or are you going to regret not having had that extra $10/week?

As always, suggestions for additions and revisions are welcome!

**I.  Sneakers**
In general, you should look for sneakers that are classic and simple.  There's always a risk of looking juvenile in sneakers, but you can minimize it by wearing the right ones.  I recommend avoiding sneakers with more than two colors and anything that was made to play a specific sport (unless that sport was tennis in the 1950s). If you're in high school, you've got a lot more leeway here.

 * *Canvas sneakers/plimsolls* - Very simple footwear that's more appropriate for spring/summer than fall/winter (although that depends on where you live, of course).  Solid colors like white, navy, tan and gray are the most versatile.  Vans, Chuck Taylors, Jack Purcells and Keds are the easiest to find, but less common brands like SeaVees, Spring Court, Superga, PF Flyers, Tretorn and Feiyue are worth hunting down if you want something more unique. 

 * *Low-top athletic shoes* - This is a tough category, because it's easy to go wrong.  If you stick to classic shoes in simple colors and avoid over-detailing and technical features,  you're on the right track.  J.Crew carries some [New Balance](http://tinyurl.com/298z6rj) and [Adidas](http://tinyurl.com/35j5xar) options, but you also can't go wrong with simple Nikes, [New Balance 574s](http://tinyurl.com/6ownyk2), Onitsuka Tigers, or Sambas.  At the high end, [Common Projects](http://tinyurl.com/dbxz49) and [MMM GATs](http://i.imgur.com/7R1CM.jpg) are fantastic, but if you know what those are, you don't need this guide.  

 * *High-tops* - Out of all the sneaker categories, these are the most likely to look juvenile, so I'd say avoid unless you're already sure they fit your style.  [Nike Blazers](http://i.imgur.com/yT3Kd) and [Supra mid-tops](http://i.imgur.com/Yr7EK.jpg) in solid colors are the most versatile choices (high-top Chucks too, but that's really a different style than most people associate with high-tops.)  I'm also a fan of the mid-top hikers that New Balance has been doing the last couple years ([J.Crew pairs her](http://aheadlongdive.com/2012/02/02/new-balance-for-j-crew-h710-rainier-hiker-boots/)e, [classic gray](http://i.imgur.com/rjgmI.jpg)).  There's an entire sneakerhead culture built around Dunks,  Raf and RO, and this intro guide isn't meant for any of that.  Check out [Kicksonfire](http://www.kicksonfire.com/), [slamxhype](http://slamxhype.com/tag/sneakers/), [hypebeast](http://hypebeast.com/tags/footwear/), or the [SF Official Baller Sneaker Thread](http://tinyurl.com/7mgs8rx) for more on that style.

 * *Avoid* - Actual running shoes and Vibram Five-fingers toe-shoes - **unless actually running!** To preempt a backlash, no one is telling you not to wear athletic shoes for sports, but wearing [shoes like this](http://i.imgur.com/P3gyp.gif) with jeans or chinos is a style disaster.  Be wary of [fashion sneakers](http://i.imgur.com/32rMD.jpg) from places like Diesel and Lacoste too - they're often flashy and way overpriced for the quality.  There are so many good, simple shoes that there's no reason to pay for the fashion company markup.  I'm sure someone will point out some reasonable ones, but they're the exception.  Unless you're at the beach (or CA/FL), avoid sandals.  Additionally - and I realize this is probably a controversial opinion - I'd avoid black sneakers completely, unless you already know that they fit your style.  Black isn't a versatile color, despite what most people think - it doesn't match dark indigo denim, for example, which is what you'd probably be wearing with sneakers most often.  Additionally, in menswear, black is associated with evening and formal events, which makes it a poor match for sneakers.  


**II.  Casual/In-between Shoes**
Lots of guys focus on sneakers for casual shoes, but in almost every case, they'd be better off moving up into this category.  These are shoes that are still casual (almost all of them would look great with jeans, rolled-up chinos and shorts) but look more mature than sneakers.  Again, opt for classic styles with a history - it's harder to go wrong with something that's been around, virtually unchanged, for 75-100 years.  These'll generally cost more than sneakers, but not as much as well-made dress shoes.  In many cases, they're resoleable (like dress shoes), which extends their life dramatically.

 * *Loafers* - Not dress shoes - they're for *loafing*.  [Bass](http://www.zappos.com/bass-longwood-cognac) makes affordable loafers ([and has a long history with this type of shoe](http://tinyurl.com/88xqt4y)), [Rancourt](http://www.rancourtandcompany.com/men-s/penny-loafers.html) and [Oak Street](http://tinyurl.com/6ooq7ba) make mid-range models, and [shell cordovan Alden Leisure Handsewns](http://tinyurl.com/7qz4cbu) are the holy grail.  Types include [full-strap](http://i.imgur.com/rkLcw), [pinch-penny](http://i.imgur.com/c1Apb), [beefroll](http://i.imgur.com/RWqOx), [tassel](http://i.imgur.com/hMctR) and [venetian loafers](http://i.imgur.com/LNInM.jpg).  I love beefroll loafers, but that's a personal preference.

 * *Bucks* - in [white nubuck](http://tinyurl.com/85kto3j) or [tan suede](http://tinyurl.com/7rfn48w), with a red brick sole.  Classic spring/summer footwear, perfectly appropriate with jeans, go-to-hell chinos or shorts (sockless).  To wear white bucks the most traditional way, [you've got to go all-in preppy](http://tinyurl.com/6qnx9ft) or pick up [a seersucker suit](http://i.imgur.com/qGc76).  To use an oxymoron, white bucks are [the most traditional go-to-hell shoes](http://i.imgur.com/GNPwl.jpg).  Tan bucks are a little easier to wear, imo - they look great with jeans, for example.  [There are brighter-colored options](http://www.walkover.com/Collections), but not until you have other footwear basics covered.

 * *Desert boots/chukkas* - [Clarks Desert Boots \(CDBs\)](http://tinyurl.com/8xvgg7u) get mocked as *the* MFA-hivemind item, but the fact of the matter is that they're a pretty good in-between option.  Beeswax leather and taupe or sand suede are the most versatile choices.  Lots of other companies make chukka boots too - from low-quality $40 pairs at Kohls to [$700 shell cordovan Aldens](http://i.imgur.com/6dFIa.jpg).  

 * *Blucher mocs/canoe mocs/camp mocs* - A more grown-up alternative to boat shoes. These generally have a charcoal or red sole, 1-4 eyelets, and no collar lacing.  [GQ tells you why they're classics.](http://i.imgur.com/HW59S.jpg) [ LL Bean makes affordable pairs](http://tinyurl.com/7mtatud), Quoddy and Yuketen make higher-end pairs (in Maine).  I've beat the hell out of [this pair of Quoddy Canoe Mocs in chromexcel](http://i.imgur.com/swCnV.jpg) for three straight summers and they just keep looking better and better.  IMO, that's the advantage of paying for quality up front.  I'm biased, because these are my favorite casual shoes.  Here are some other photos - [Blue chromexcel Oak Streets on Simplethreads](http://tinyurl.com/8775tc8), [LL Bean](http://i.imgur.com/UhTX7), [LL Bean Signature](http://i.imgur.com/IP1Cs), [Sebago Campsides](http://i.imgur.com/HLodw), [Oak Streets in navy suede with red brick sole.](http://i.imgur.com/vcXDu.jpg)

 * *Boat shoes* - Like desert boots, these probably don't need an introduction.  Wear [Sperry Top-sider A/Os in Sahara](http://www.zappos.com/sperry-top-sider-authentic-original-sahara) without socks and you'll look seven guys out of ten in the summer (for good or ill).  If you want to go higher-end, Sperry has done some designer collaborations (Band of Outsiders, recently) and shoemakers like Alden, Allen Edmonds, Quoddy and Russell Moccasin all make boat shoes.  

 * *Avoid* - Sneaker/dress shoe hybrids like the ones from Sketchers, Rockport and Clarks.  [You know what I'm referring to.](http://i.imgur.com/djKx3.jpg)  They're overdetailed, overcomplicated and overpriced, and they're invariably worn by guys who think they're stealthily getting away with wearing sneakers when dress shoes are required.  There are so many better options for in-between shoes that there is literally no excuse to buy these.

1341075414.0,961,self.malefashionadvice,vuhd4,Simple guide to tailoring/slimming/taking in your shirt,1165,204,150,http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/vuhd4/simple_guide_to_tailoringslimmingtaking_in_your/,"MFA has helped me to improve my style and the fit of my clothes considerably. Thus, it's time for me to give back. I've seen a few posts recently asking how to tailor / slim / take in a shirt. Since I've been doing just that for about a month now, I thought I'd offer a quick guide, with some tips and tricks I've picked up along the way. Note that I posted much of this as a comment recently, but I thought I'd repost it as a top-level post, with more detail and pictures. 

Taking in a shirt really isn't too hard to do, but I'm not a fan of the 'pinch and pin' method that is often described elsewhere on the web. It's too easy to add asymmetry to the shirt. I prefer to measure and mark how much I'm going to remove. Plus, I would try this first with a shirt that you're o.k. getting rid of; while slimming your shirts isn't hard, it does take a little practice to get perfect. Here's the basics along with some important points:

***Keep in mind that if the shoulders of your shirt are too big (i.e., too wide from shoulder seam to seam), they can't really be fixed and your shirt will never really look right.***

For demonstration, I will be taking in [this white OCBD](http://imgur.com/xFazm). It doesn't fit me awful, but [it's about 4-5 inches too big around in the stomach](http://imgur.com/jFZFK) and throughout the rest of the torso (albeit not as bad). It's also [too baggy in the arms](http://imgur.com/CUMS8). We'll fix that at the same time. Ultimate, [we are going to replace the entire seam along the side of the shirt](http://imgur.com/Qx2J4). The existing seam is called a 'flat felled seam'. It's fairly complicated to make, and trying to 'tie into it' would never look quite right, so I'm just going to replace the whole seam with a simple straight stitch. 

First put on the shirt, and using a tailor's tape (those flexible measuring tapes tailors use to take measurements) measure the circumference of your torso at your armpits and each button on the shirt below your armpits. Write these numbers down. **I use the same mantra in tailoring that I do in woodworking - measure twice, cut once.**

For a nice slim shirt, I use the following calculation to find the new width across the shirt (in inches) at each point you just measured on your body: width = (circumference+5)/2. This width will give you about 1 inch of pinched fabric on each side of you. Note that for a looser fit, just change the 5 to 6.

Based on my measurements and these calculations, the width of my shirt should be 21.5"", 20.25"", 19.25"", 19.0"", 20"", and 21"" starting at the button at armpit level and working down. 

Completely button your shirt, turn it inside out, and place the shirt flat on the ground or a table (not your bed, it's too lumpy). Using your tape, and starting at the armpit, mark the new width of your shirt. I basically move the tape up the shirt until the [width at the armpit seam equals the width you want](http://imgur.com/atgdP). Note that altering the shirt in the manner I describe will raise the armpits. Mark this spot on both sides of the shirt. I use tailor's chalk, or in this case a fabric marking pen, which you can pick up at Walmart for a few bucks. Once again, measure twice (notice I messed up the first time, hence the extra marks). 

Continue to mark the width of the shirt at each [button below the armpit](http://imgur.com/eO5kB). Keep in mind that you can always take away more fabric, never less. So if you are unsure, start with a wider shirt; you can always go back and slim the shirt some more. Finally, the width of your shirt probably shouldn't change by more than 1"" per button, so if you have a very 'hourglass' figure, you might not want to slim the shirt too much in the thinnest areas.

Ultimately, I made the width of my shirt 21.5"" at the armpit, then 20.5"", 19.5"", 19.5"", 20"", and 21"" at the last button (which is where the shirt ends at the hip).

Now, [connect all the dots.](http://imgur.com/njFe7)

You'll also have to slim the sleeves somewhat. Again, there's no way around it since we are replacing the whole seam. Measure the circumference of your bicep (don't flex) at it's widest point. The width of your sleeve at this point will be: width=(circumference+3)/2. Again, this will give you about 1 inch of pinched fabric at your bicep; change the 3 to a 4 for a looser fit or if you've got really big guns when flexed. My measurement suggests that I should use a 7.5"" width, but I'm going to use an 8"" width. 

Place the tape measure perpendicular to the top of the sleeve and such that it crosses the bottom of the sleeve about 2 inches from the armpit. [Now measure down from the top of the sleeve to your new width and mark the sleeve at this point.](http://imgur.com/K3RRk)

Connect these markings with those at the armpit and [the seam at the end of the sleeve](http://imgur.com/nVTrp). At the end of the sleeve, you want the new width of the sleeve to equal the old width. Because you'll by tying the new seam into the old seam at this point, it will look a little odd, but absolutely no one is going to notice.

[Here's my shirt all marked up.](http://imgur.com/GeALJ)

Time to start sewing. I [start at the armpit to make sure the armpit seams from both sides of the shirt meet perfectly](http://imgur.com/as6NB). Basically, using a straight stitch I start at the armpit and sew towards the end of the sleeve. Again, at the end of the sleeve you want the [new seam to meet the edge of the shirt](http://imgur.com/3yKNn). Then I start at the [same armpit](http://imgur.com/om3BG) and sew towards the [bottom of the shirt.](http://imgur.com/kQ4h5)

Do this on both sides of the shirt.

Now [try your shirt on](http://imgur.com/wqca1). At this point, everything can be undone. If the shirt is too loose, remark it and sew it again. If the shirt is too tight, you can undo the stitching with a seam ripper. I could probably take another half inch out of each side, but I want to wear it as it is for a day before I take it in any more. Plus, I'll be wearing an undershirt with this shirt (since it's a little see-through), which will take up some more space.

If you're happy with the new seam, you will have to cut away the extra fabric (otherwise the shirt won't hang quite right). However, the fabric will fray if you just cut it and leave it with normal scissors. So, you have two options: 1. you can either sew a zigzag stitch or some other stitch that prevents fraying in the fabric to be removed (i.e., between the new seam and the old seam) as close as possible to the strait stitch or I just use [pinking shears to cut away the extra fabric](http://imgur.com/X9aXr). Pinking shears cut fabric in a zig-zag pattern to minimize fraying. I will admit that pinking shears are not an ideal way to prevent fraying, but they work well enough for me, and I'm lazy.

That should be it. [Here's my newly slimmed shirt.](http://imgur.com/wboLt)

The problem is that even a shirt that may be your favorite, deep blue and look great with your complexion can kind of botch everything else when you try to put it into an outfit.

You see [dark blue a lot](http://imgur.com/JuQJp). . . . and it might have actually been in style at one point (mid-90s?). But now it looks [bad](http://imgur.com/7cwkz). Pretty much always. Even if your suit fits well . . . take [this guy for example](http://i.imgur.com/S1f4e.jpg). He at least looks passable, but the shirt still looks cheap and dated.

What about red? [Nope. It usually doesn't work](http://imgur.com/ktUHO). I think it looks bad even when someone [as slick as Robert Downy Jr. wears it](http://imgur.com/cPXp2). (granted however, that it *does* match his armor). The thing about shirts with bold, solid colors is that they overwhelm the rest of your outfit. A harmonious outfit is all about delicate contrasts--about subtle phrasing colors, patterns, and textures to create a coherent whole. Bold solid shirts like these are overpowering and destroy the coherence of the whole, no matter what you do with the fit, the suit and the tie. It would be like putting a heavy metal guitar into a reggae song, or a trombone into a metal song.

Even if you have a [darker complexion,](http://alt.coxnewsweb.com/cnishared/tools/shared/mediahub/01/08/14/slideshow_1140814_mystycarson.0621_12.JPG) it's difficult to make shirts like [this really work](http://imgur.com/1sn7L). Also unlike the guy in the first picture with his green shirt, you frequently *can* use a contrasted collar to pull off a blue, pastel yellow, or [pink shirt and still look quite good](http://i.imgur.com/EEvWR.jpg). The key is just to have something to break up that wall of color.

And even when the shirt and the suit [fit well and are worn with a trendier cut and pattern, the look still falls flat](http://i.imgur.com/lNDUt.jpg).

The [black shirt is something you see sometimes too](http://imgur.com/GAKGF), especially on celebrities. I think that in a limited number of circumstances, this CAN look good . . . but it still just looks good--not great. I honestly think it only works because they are all doing it. An outfit like this also is less versatile, limited to night clubs and dinner parties.

And then... there's [this color...Brown? Burnt orange?](http://imgur.com/qeffu). Avoid at all costs! 

Lighter solids and gentler colors can work well. For instance [light blue](http://imgur.com/if8u6) is always a safe, classic choice. I recently got a job offer after from an interview where I wore a light blue shirt with a navy suit. A pale [lavender shirt](http://i.imgur.com/2jPrq.jpg) can look great too, although you probably shouldn't wear it to an interview.

Finally, [light pink looks very nice as well](http://imgur.com/r9K38). Pink is actually a pretty versatile (though n.b., not conservative) color. You can even go a bit darker than LeBron's ""is-it-white-or-is-it-pink"" shirt and it will still look *okay*, although go to far, and you will be in trouble like [this guy is](http://i.imgur.com/NdWXp.jpg). it's a slippery slope here, because if you go too dark, even with pink, then you get hot pink or a weird salmon, which creates [the same problem that you have with the colors above](http://i.imgur.com/xj9ZS.jpg).

Also, skin tone does make a difference. As a pasty white guy, I realize that black people can wear colors I could never get away with--case in point [Rajon Rondo](http://i.imgur.com/Oe2Jg.png). I also am frequently amazed at how [Shannon Sharpe manages to pull off some of the things that he wears](http://i.imgur.com/e898g.jpg). And I think, that even he probably realizes he's [treading in precarious territory](http://i.imgur.com/87Xwi.jpg), but somehow, he pulls it off. I can't tell you how he makes it work, but he does. Maybe everything just works better when you have three superbowl rings to accessorize.

Bold colors have their place and can look great--but if you are wearing a suit, the color should not be solid covering the whole shirt. Instead, [use the strong color in a pattern, and it will look much better](http://i.imgur.com/iqjcZ.jpg). Here's another example of how putting a hot color in a pattern, rather than the whole shirt, subdues it a little bit and makes the [outfit look great](http://i.imgur.com/uPhGn.jpg) (note that this guy's tie and suit are saved from being too monochromatic by the flash of color in his tie tack and pocket square!).


TL;DR: Don't wear a dress shirt that is a bold solid color. If you are going to go solid, go with a pale color or a gentle color. If you are going to go bold, don't go solid--use a pattern or texture.

**edit** people have correctly pointed out that this post is more about wearing a bold-colored-solid shirt with a suit and tie rather than wearing it casually. And indeed, like any rule of fashion, this rule is just a guideline and a general rule that you will always look good if you follow. But this is fashion. Rules like this are [made to be broken](http://i.imgur.com/QQ7Nr.jpg). (I still can't decide if that guy looks good though because of his hair and the filter on the camera though, or if his outfit actually looks good). Indeed, a bright red shirt can be iconic, for example, on [Michael Jackson](http://i.imgur.com/NpUuU.jpg). But the odds are that this only looks good because Michael Jackson is wearing it, and it's part of his signature look.His son, Prince, tried to emulate it and ended up [looking like a goon](http://i.imgur.com/3xG4T.jpg). As an analogy, Michael Jackson also had a Jheri curl. You should probably not have a Jheri curl. 

Similarly, [Johnny Cash was known famously as the man in black](http://imgur.com/fig4s). Since then [many other country singers](http://i.imgur.com/dtzR9.jpg) continue to look great in [black on black](http://imgur.com/ZIwk1). But again, they are cowboys and this is part of their signature look. 

Most of us will probably fail if we try to pull this off. For 90% of us, even if you pair a shirt like this with a nice tie, a good haircut, and a tie bar, [the shirt will still look cheap and dated](http://i.imgur.com/d4pLZ.jpg). This is just my opinion, but I thin it is a good general rule, and at the very least, you won't look bad!

**edit 2**: LeBron James's shirt might actually be white. I really can't tell. Sometimes [pink is like that](http://www.us.thomaspink.com/Abson-Herringbone-Shirt---Double-Cuff//thomas-pink/fcp-product/99920527).

[Here's the kit visually](http://i.imgur.com/adObk7P.jpg)

Details &amp; prices:


 * [McNairy x Keds Triumph sneakers,](http://www.6pm.com/keds-mark-mcnairy-triumph-suede-white?zfcTest=mat%3A1) $42 with free shipping.  I like [Mark McNairy,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_McNairy) but as a designer, I realize he's kind of polarizing.  His line of shoes for Keds the past few years has been a cheap way to get into his work (unlike his flagship [New Amsterdam line](http://shop.markmcnairy.com/collections/all/)) - especially since they always seem to go on clearance at the end of the season.  6pm (the Zappos outlet site) happens to have a full size run of [the Triumph sneakers from last spring](http://www.theblueprintmagazine.com/index.php/item/4614-keds-mark) in white with a red sole, which is one of the more versatile colors from the line.  The laces would be easy to replace if orange nylon isn't your bag.  *Edit:* [Turns out there's a canvas version that's even cheaper on the Keds website.](http://m.keds.com/mt/www.keds.com/store/SiteController/keds/productdetails?productId=5-175500&amp;stockNumber=MF44875&amp;skuId=***5********MF44875*M080&amp;selectedWidth=-1&amp;selectedSize=-1&amp;showDefaultOption=true&amp;_requestid=81473)


 * [Two pairs of JCP shorts,](http://www.jcpenney.com/dotcom//men/brands/jcp/the-short/prod.jump?ppId=ens6002490004&amp;catId=cat1001520004&amp;deptId=dept20000014&amp;dimCombo=null&amp;dimComboVal=null) $14 each.  The new JCP line is being steered by Nick Wooster, [Dappered had mostly good things to say,](http://dappered.com/2013/02/review-the-jcpenny-spring-2013-wooster-led-line/), and /u/Alfa147x [did a thorough photo review of these shorts last week](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/1amp4h/jcpenney_14_jcp_flatfront_shorts_pictures_and/).  It looks like the inseam is 8-9"" (depending on the waist size), which should hit a hair above the knee for most folks - short enough to be in style, but not so short that you'd feel self-conscious (not that you *should* feel self-conscious showing a few extra inches of leg, but I digress).  For colors, I'd get two of the versatile basics (British khaki, grey, stone, navy) unless you already have some good shorts, in which case I'd look at green, yellow, bright blue and red as alternatives. 


 * [Three Alternative Apparel tshirts from Put This On's *Summer of White Tees* wholesale group order](http://putthison.com/post/46247466135/summer-of-white-tees-2013-with-gray-tees-too), $9.90 each.  These are normally $20, but once a year, /u/JesseThorn organizes a group wholesale order.  The catch is that you have to wait 4-6 weeks to get them, but since a lot of the US is still digging out of the snow, I suspect that's not a problem.  [The fit chart on their website is vague](http://z-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/314uSHizPDL.html), but from what I've read, these fit reasonably slim and long, much like American Apparel.  He's doing white crew-necks and v-necks plus heather grey crewnecks, but you can't mix and match.  Both colors would work with any colors of the JCP shorts (or *anything else in the world*, really).


**Total: $99.70**

***As always, if you don't like the style, the colors, or whatever, you should put together your own $100 kit and post it.  If it's too frat-douche or too New England preppy or too dad-ish or too grandpa-ish or too hipster or too colorful or too plain or too something else, this is your official invitation to make a better one.  I don't have any special skills at this - it's mostly just waiting for sales on basics to align.  It would be great to see more people doing these, in my opinion.***

And the more I thought about it, I realized that I've been noticing a lot of denim sausages in general lately, among other fitted-jean-wearing dudes.

1361921527.0,936,self.malefashionadvice,19ah8n,A Guide to J. Crew,1225,289,301,http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/19ah8n/a_guide_to_j_crew/,"Hello MFAers, and welcome to my guide to J. Crew. After seeing the interest in [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/198nlb/everyone_wears_j_crew_article_in_march_2013_issue/), I decided to make a guide to J. Crew, seeing as how some people had questions, and many others may wonder why J. Crew is a good option for beginners and anyone in general.

I have been buying clothes at J. Crew for years and would consider myself a J.Crew-aholic. However, I will do my best to remain impartial when presenting the information. So without further ado, here is the guide:

**Brief History of J. Crew:**

J. Crew began as a rebranding of Popular Club Brand in the 80's. The first ever catalog was shipped in 1983, and in 1989 the flagship store in downtown Manhattan was built. J. Crew has exploded and expanded ever since. J. Crew's women's line has traditionally been much more popular than their offerings for men, but in recent years the growth of the men's line has outpaced the women's line in surprising fashion.  High-profile employees include Jenna Lyons, President and creative director; Millard Drexler, who was the CEO of GAP from the 90's until 2002 (often credited with GAP's unbelievable rise in popularity in the 90's); and, perhaps most important for us, Frank Muytjens, head of the Men's Design at J. Crew.

Frank Muytjens is probably the reason why J. Crew is so appealing to many of us in this community today. For those that don't know, he was brought on to J. Crew in 2008, following his departure after 8 years designing with Polo Ralph Lauren. His time there is easily seen in his love for American Workwear and the way it manifests itself into J. Crew's recent offerings, which I promise I'll delve into much further detail later. He's also solely responsible for many of J. Crew's collaborations, which I'm sure many of you have seen, including Alden, Crockett &amp; Jones, Sperry, Ray-ban, Red Wing, and many more iconic brands. In addition, he revitalized the Men's offerings with the introduction of the Ludlow suits (quite revered here at MFA).

**Why J. Crew?**  
So you might be asking, so what? What makes J. Crew different from other brands? Why am I even wasting my time reading this guide? Well, first of all, J. Crew offers good-quality basics that last at a semi-reasonable price point (more on that later). In addition, J. Crew draws from the history of clothing more than many brands of its caliber. This is evident in its Thomas Mason line of shirting, it's 60's and 80's inspired suiting, and revitalization of other classics, in everything from outerwear to socks. Personally, I feel that J. Crew's attention to detail is really what separates it from say, Gap, or Uniqlo. In addition, J. Crew has developed a sort of cult following (I myself am clearly guilty of being a part of that cohort) due to the culture that J. Crew embodies. Although it may not have the revered history of Brook's Brothers, I think J. Crew pays a lot of attention to letting customers know why it creates the clothing that it does. It has an atmosphere at its brick and mortar stores that scream vintage and it tries to act as if it's selling you timeless classics rather than just functional clothing. But if you're not convinced, go and try out some of J. Crew's clothing and see for yourself.

Now let's talk about what you can buy from J. Crew

**Pricing**
Before we do that though, pricing should be mentioned. Pricing at J. Crew is probably its #1 complaint. People, especially with MFA's demographic, feel that J. Crew is too expensive. I personally agree. If you buy J. Crew at full retail, chances are that you would be better off buying somewhere else, with a few exceptions. However, J. Crew regularly has 30-40% off sale items, and the occasional 30-40% off all items in store. Also, if you sign up for their, you will receive a 10% off coupon within days that you can apply to any online purchase (I believe this also comes with free shipping, although I'm not 100% sure). J. Crew also has the oft-mentioned 15% student discount. Just show your student ID and provide a valid college email in store and you will receive 15% off your purchase. This does not work online. If you are not a student/teacher, you can still take advantage of this discount, provided you look young and still have your old college ID. 

If you decide to work at J. Crew (I have no experience with this), I believe the employee discount is 5 items per month @ 50% that you can wear while working (so this does not include outerwear, etc) and 30% off storewide. This may vary from store to store, but it's a definite perk of working there.

**T-shirts**
Let's start with the basics. J. Crew currently offers basically every variation of the basic T-shirt that you can think of. [Crew neck]( http://www.jcrew.com/mens_category/polostees/brokeninjerseytees/PRDOVR~10132/10132.jsp)/[V neck]( http://www.jcrew.com/mens_category/polostees/brokeninjerseytees/PRDOVR~15773/15773.jsp)/[pocket tee]( http://www.jcrew.com/mens_category/polostees/brokeninjerseytees/PRDOVR~31270/31270.jsp)/[color block]( http://www.jcrew.com/mens_category/polostees/indigo/PRDOVR~99047/99047.jsp)/[nautical stripe]( http://www.jcrew.com/mens_category/polostees/graphicandstripetees/PRDOVR~33332/33332.jsp) are just some of the options. If you can think of it, J. Crew probably has it. Most J. Crew T-shirts tend to be made of a very light and thin cotton (their broken-in line) and really feel like they've been broken in. The broken-in jersey tee is one of the best fitting and feeling tees that you can buy. Avoid some of the more expensive T-shirts (usually new releases) unless you can get them @30% off. They aren’t worth that much. The basic broken-in t-shirts are great though.

**Polos/Henleys**
I lumped these together because I have limited experience with Henleys and I really didn’t want to make it its own section. However, I own several of the polos, and I can honestly say that they are the best polo I have ever worn. They are comparable to the RL custom fit polos, but are logoless, which I prefer. The [slim fit](http://www.jcrew.com/mens_category/polostees/shortsleevepolos/PRDOVR~93952/93952.jsp) makes for a great spring/summer classic and they have a variety of colors to choose from. The one linked is in pique, but they offer a regular broken-in variety as well. I recommend the oft-mentioned navy and white as a starting point. Be wary of the way the long-sleeve polos fit in the arms, as they are pretty slim. J. Crew’s henleys, which make great layering pieces, are also available in a wide variety. However, having never owned one, I can’t say much about it, other than there are probably better options at that price point.

**Sweaters/Hoodies**
Personally, I feel that one of J. Crew’s strongest points is their sweaters. They offer everything from cotton to cotton-cashmere blend to merino wool to cashmere. Their cardigans, I find, fit extremely well and are excellent quality. I personally own several cotton and merino wool sweaters, along with one cotton-cashmere sweaters and they are all extremely durable and look fantastic with OCBD’s under them. I would avoid their all-cashmere sweaters mostly because Club Monaco offers better ones at a cheaper price point. You can find the styles that J. Crew sells [here](http://www.jcrew.com/mens_category/sweaters.jsp). I don't like J. Crew hoodies that much. There are much better alternatives at that price range. Avoid unless on sale.

**Shirts**
Honestly, this is probably the reason that J. Crew is as successful as it is. Their shirting is fantastic. OCBD quality is great (though slightly less durable than Brook’s Brothers) and the variety of shirting patterns is fantastic. There are way too many variations of shirting to cover in this guide, but some highlights include the [OCBD](http://www.jcrew.com/mens_category/shirts/oxfordshirts.jsp), [Ludlow Dress Shirt]( http://www.jcrew.com/mens_category/shirts/ludlowdressshirts.jsp), [Chambray + denim]( http://www.jcrew.com/mens_category/shirts/workshirts.jsp), and of course their [Thomas Mason Line]( http://www.jcrew.com/mens_category/shirts/thomasmasonfshirts.jsp). 

Their Thomas Mason line was inspired by Thomas Mason, who created shirts in the late 1800s, and was recently acquired by an Italian shirting company, which collaborates with J. Crew. To view a video about this fascinating collaboration, you can view videos, including [this]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJNGrF3eMqA)
For anyone new to J. Crew, I would highly recommend starting with one of these shirts. They will get you hooked!

**Pants**
J. Crew offers a variety of pant cuts as well. The most popular being their new 484 fit (similar to Dockers Alphas, iirc) as well as their Urban Slim Fit. Avoid their bootcut and slim-straight cuts, as they tend to fall into the same pitfalls that other similar cuts face.
At the price range of the 484 jeans, I would say there are many better options out there, so leave your denim purchases to another store. 
The Bowery pant is perfect for wearing to work, although it may not be as fashionable as some of the other pant options.
Chinos are where J. Crew shines, in my opinion. There’s the [slim-fit broken-in Chino](http://www.jcrew.com/mens_category/pants/brokeninchinos/PRDOVR~19488/19488.jsp) as well as the [Essential Chino in slim fit]( http://www.jcrew.com/mens_category/pants/essentialchinos/PRDOVR~53368/53368.jsp), which are comfortable as fuck.
Also, for a F/W approach, J. Crew cords in 484 look great, and are the best pair of cords I’ve ever worn.

**Suiting**
When talking about J. Crew suiting, you have to mention the [Ludlow Suit]( http://www.jcrew.com/mens_feature/TheLudlowShop.jsp). Available in many fabrics and colors (cotton, Italian wool, cashmere, linen, etc), the Ludlow Suit is possibly the best suit you can buy at its price point. There’s a reason it took J. Crew from having a mediocre menswear selection to having one of the most famous.  The cut is fantastic, featuring high notch lapels and a 2.5” lapel width. They look great with skinny ties and I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a great suit. 
Also, avoid their ties and pocket squares. They’re not worth the price, unfortunately. Check out [TheTieBar](thetiebar.com) for similar and much better priced ties and pocket squares.

**Shorts**
This is also one of J.Crew’s best-selling points. They offer 6 cuts: Club, Stanton, Beach, Broken-in chinos, Essential, and Utility. Personally, I’d recommend the Stanton (very basic, a bit wider in the leg) and Club (lower rise, tighter in thigh). Also, for those of you with actual man-thighs, check out the Essential cut. I’m pretty sure that all of these are offered at 7,9, and 11” inseam lengths (although they’re calculated differently because of the way they’re sewn, so make sure you try them on in store). [link]( http://www.jcrew.com/mens_category/shorts.jsp)

**Outerwear**
I’ll be honest: I’m not impressed with J. Crew’s outerwear. Although I own two different styles, none of them have been as impressive as you can find from other brands. A lot of their outerwear is done via collaborations anyway. If anyone has anything good to say about these, feel free to say it. Otherwise, I’d find something cheaper from a more reputable outerwear company. I’ve heard that their University Coat is decent, but having never worn it myself, I can’t be sure of that).

**Accessories/bags**

J. Crew actually has some pretty cool accessories and bags, although I’m sure you could find similar ones elsewhere. I personally have an iPhone case (literally just because it’s J. Crew, not because of anything else), and [Abingdon Messenger Bag]( http://www.jcrew.com/mens_category/accessories/bags/PRDOVR~51657/51657.jsp) (Fantastic, by the way), and other miscellaneous items.

**Collaborations**
In general, J. Crew collaborations are much more pricy than the original, but not that much better. However, there are a few to watch out for that are fantastic. Of course, there’s the [Killshot II]( http://www.jcrew.com/mens_category/shoes/sneakers/PRDOVR~85231/99102715357/ENE~1+2+3+22+4294967294+20~~~0~15~all~mode+matchallany~~~~~killshot/85231.jsp), (J. Crew x Nike) as well as their Sperry Collaborations. There’s the Alden collection as well, which is worth taking a look at if you have a lot of money to blow. Other than that, I would avoid most collaborations, especially their notebooks (wtf), espadrilles, backpacks, and watches (Especially their grossly overpriced J. Crew x Timex).

**Conclusion:**

I may go ahead and post some more information regarding things that I decided were less important at a later time. Also, I’ll comment on J. Crew Factory in the future, but I want to try out some of their new releases first. In general, J. Crew Factory is of much less quality than J. Crew, but there are a few gems among the rest of the shit that it produces. At a 40% + 15% student discount, however, it can be some of the most affordable and stylish clothing that you can get. If you have any comments of things I should add/delete/reorganize, feel free to mention them below and I’ll make any additions I feel are necessary.

**Tl;dr** J. Crew is awesome, except a few things.

EDIT 1: Wallace and Barnes is the line by J. Crew that is inspired by American Workwear. I find that these pieces are actually pretty nice, though I would say that they are an ""okay"" value. If you can some of the pieces on sale, they are worth it. Otherwise, I would consider other brands.

**A Note on J. Crew Factory**

J. Crew factory offers many similar items to J. Crew, albeit at a huge hit to quality. However, the price often makes up for it. Generally, most of J. Crew Factory's stock is 30-40% off. The washed shirts are great for that price (~$25). STAY AWAY from accessories (ties,etc). They wear out insanely quickly. I view J. Crew Factory as an alternative to Old Navy in terms of quality, but their styles are much more modern and sophisticated. Stay away from graphic tees/polos as well. There are a few gems, but be careful when shopping there. Almost ALL J. Crew factory items will have two diamonds on the tag, indicated that they are part of the offshoot brand.

With that last goal in mind, this post will be a fourth bullet for the **Getting Started** section at the top of the sidebar - it'll join fit, color, and basic wardrobe in *The Very Important List of Things MFA Newcomers Must Read*.  

I don't claim to have any personal insight into how to develop a personal style, so I've aggregated some of the best resources out there.  One thing I would encourage is image collecting - [our list of blogs](http://redd.it/p6exh), [inspiration albums,](http://bit.ly/Ylloh8) and [monthly ""Top of WAYWT"" compilations](http://bit.ly/W11HdL) are a good start.  Save pictures you like to a folder - don't overthink it, don't dwell or deliberate.  If an image appeals to you, even for reasons you can't put your finger on, just right-click and put it in there.  Going back through a folder of images can reveal patterns and preferences you might not have been able to articulate.  Figure out *what* you like, then *why*.

**[Fashion and a Cup of Tea (/u/Syeknom's personal blog) on the value of understanding, then breaking, ""the rules""](http://fashionandacupoftea.com/on-fashion-rules/)**

&gt;The common analogy (itself almost mnemonic) compares dressing well to any other form of art – music, writing or painting for example. In order to break the rules and be creative it is important to fundamentally understand the basics. Picking up a guitar, rejecting the notion of chords, rhythm or keys and just hammering away at the strings with a bunch of effects pedals switched on may be fun but will rarely lead to great development or the ability to express anything personal or honest. John Cage didn’t simply stick a bunch of spoons inside a piano and compose avant-garde masterpieces – his prepared piano pieces were an organic development out of years of studying, performing, experimenting and the influence of Indian musical forms and philosophy.

**[/u/TheHeartofTuxes on developing personal style](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/xyihx/how_did_you_discover_your_style/c5qum5d)**

&gt;This question goes far beyond what you wear. It points to how you engage with life and how life unfolds through you.

&gt;This is a question of perceiving something that is already happening, not about trying to find the 'right' idea. It's about seeing into an organic process rather than deciding something out of the blue....The central point is that your style should come from you and your actual life. And in fact, it's already there if you learn how to see it. The more you can look unflinchingly at your own values and beliefs, your own personal qualities and interests, the better you will know your personal style.

&gt;My advice: do not chase the whimsical winds of fashion. Doing this is like trying to catch a shadow; the faster you move, the faster it evades you. Instead seek to understand what styles, colors, patterns, and fit best compliment you.  Armed with this information, you will save yourself time and money by immediately eliminating 90% of the clothing out there and focusing on the 10% that highlights your strengths.

**[The Trad: Style Defined](http://thetrad.blogspot.com/2010/11/style-defined.html)**

&gt;""Building a personal style, creatively understanding oneself, seeking out those whose work and vision coincides - this is not something that can be accomplished overnight, or by giving in to the ever-changing whim of the moment. It is the work of a lifetime. And it is only possible when a sense of self is present: knowing every facet of oneself, trusting one's ""eye"" and heart, and being fearless.""

&gt;Clothes should be worn. They should be used. They become more personal, more distinctive and more beautiful - for me - when they have been worn lovingly for years.

**[Fuuma at Stylezeitgeist tells you how to get started](http://stylezeitgeist.com/forums/showpost.php?p=10563&amp;postcount=11) (from the same post by /u/djmykeski)**

&gt; * Go to many fashion forums, that way you'll be exposed to different groupthink. Try reading fashion magazines, watch movies, people-watch and generally seek various sources of info in a not-so discriminating way. If you don't know exactly what you need it makes sense to say you're not set on where it is. Sadly, a negative externality of this approach is that might include sending some money to Condé Nast unless you can find ways to steal their overpriced mags.

&gt; * Go to loads of different stores and try garments on, getting a feel of what's available, once again without discriminating too much. Try to get feedback from other people, unless you plan to live on a deserted island you'll have to deal with the all-seeing eye of the multitude.

&gt; * Get inexpensive items in various styles that interest you and experiment with different looks. H&amp;M, Uniqlo, discount shopping, thrifting and ebay are your friends, and might remain so anyway.

&gt; * Avoid deciding what your style is without having worn that stuff for a while!

**[Put This On: Personal Style through Elimination](http://putthison.com/post/35569320611/personal-style-through-elimination-ivy-style-had-a)**

&gt;So in continually editing out things that don’t feel right, I think I’ve come to a better sense of personal style. 
&gt;
&gt;Which is to say, if you’re just starting off, perhaps it’s not as good of an idea to “buy less, buy better.” Instead, dabble around and shop in the middle-tiers of quality. That way, you don’t lose out on too much as you try to find your own sense of style. Let your tastes slowly mature, be honest with what you wear, and cull everything that doesn’t feel like a natural extension of yourself. That’s the best way, I think, to find your own personal style: through a process of elimination.

**[/u/GraphicNovelty on finding your style by buying cheap and experimenting](http://redd.it/17hzjh)**

&gt;Personal style is not something you can develop by lurking and looking at pictures of strangers on the internet--that's a recipe for empty hype-cycleism and trendwhoring. Clothes are meant to be worn, and when you put something on that is essentialy you it feels right on some subconscious level. And, with the proliferation of fast fashion outlets that allow you to experience a wide variety of aesthetics at a relatively low price, it's never been easier to buy a bunch of random shit and see what actually works for you.

**[Effortless Gent: Defining your Style](http://www.effortlessgent.com/on-defining-your-own-style/)**

&gt;Don’t feel restricted by certain style archetypes. Don’t copy each look piece by piece. Invest in the basics. Grab a great leather jacket, a tweed sport coat, and a well-cut navy suit. Buy a pair of standard black lace-ups, some walnut wing tips, some tan brogue boots. Find a ton of handmade bracelets and silk pocket squares, discover your favorite pair of sunglasses, try on a pair of go-to-hell pants. Experiment with fabrics and fits, colors and patterns. Steal inspiration from each of these guys and come up with a look that’s all your own.
&gt;
&gt;Most importantly, have fun.

**[Matt Smith on the evolution of his personal style](http://wax-wane.com/2012/09/14/special-guest-post-matt-smith-on-the-evolution-of-personal-style/)**

&gt;What I learned most from them is that caring about whether a jacket is full or half-canvassed doesn’t make you stylish or better than the average, flip flop wearing dude next to you on the subway. Style is a process, you drew influence from a multitude of places. It’s about your passions, where you come from, how you see yourself, and how you want to see yourself.  It’s as much about the things that made you feel like you were cooler than everyone else in fifth grade, as it is about the things that make you happy right now.
&gt;
&gt;It’s about evolving and finding new influences and interesting ways of expressing what you love. It doesn’t matter if you can tell someone exactly how many stitches per inch their shirt has or how that amazing Neapolitan shoulder was made. That doesn’t make you more stylish, it just means you know about the clothes, not how to wear them, and let me tell you that’s much more important.

&gt;[A unique item of clothing, e.g. a fedora, a wolf t-shirt, or novelty tie] is not an extension of his personality or natural in any way, it is a clumsy (yet understandable) attempt to graft a personality onto himself much like a facade. He has a preconceived notion about what personality such an item has and may confer, and is hoping to have this external presentation magically alter and define his actual personality.

Nevertheless, ""goddamn faggot"", ""fuck you, douchebag"" and the like are directly in violation of MFA's community guidelines and completely unacceptable.  The first two bullets in the list of community rules are - 
&gt;
&gt; * Personal attacks towards members are not allowed.
&gt; * Demeaning comments based on race, gender, sexual orientation or other social profile are strictly prohibited.

I'm not naive enough to think those commenters will (1) read this, or (2) care, so this is mainly a reminder to the community that the *report* button is there for a reason.  It sends a comment to a special queue for mod review, and it's the quickest, most effective way to let us know that someone's behavior has violated the community's rules.  While it's no surprise that the level of discussion declines at the community gets larger and more posts hit the front page, I don't think we have to just throw up our hands and give in.  

That said, let's try not to get ridiculous or pedantic about this.  There's obviously a difference between ""I think those type of shirts look better on more slender frames"" and ""just kill yourself, fattie mcgoo"".

You can't dress better instantaneously. There is no silver bullet to dressing better. To dress better, start with the following:

(1) Read the sidebar. 

(2) Work out. Your clothes will fit you better, especially if you are overweight or super skinny.

(3) Work on small improvements. Acquire 1 / few staples at a time.
Good wardrobes are built in increments, not in one weekend. Think about where you live, the weather patterns, and upcoming events. This will prioritize your acquisitions. 

(4) Be comfortable in what you are wearing. Confidence counts more than anything else!!

Finally, keep in mind that your 20s and college years are pretty much the only time you have to truly experiment and look goofy. So throw together outfits and see what you like and don't like. That will help you develop your style. 

Cheers,

1358457879.0,858,self.malefashionadvice,16rwft,How to Take Better Self Pics for MFA,1049,191,126,http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/16rwft/how_to_take_better_self_pics_for_mfa/,"The first time I took a self pic for WAYWT I learned something: it is harder than it looks to take a good self pic. How I saw myself in the mirror looked way better than the pictures I had taken. Since then, I've gotten a bit better and so I thought I'd share some tips.

Most photos posted to MFA fall into two categories: ""fit check"" and ""show off.""

**General Tips:**

* **Good lighting is the most important thing for any photo.** Without good lighting, shots will be blurry, details will be lost and in general you'll look like crap. You may notice that a lot of top WAYWT posts are taken outdoors: nothing beats the sun for great light (full daylight is ~1000 times brighter than a typical lamp).
* Make sure you're not back lit. Light should be coming from an angle in front of you (e.g., above and in front or from your side and in front).
* If you're having trouble getting good light inside open every shade and turn on every light.
* Use the on-camera flash as a last resort. It gives a lot of light at the cost of flattening everything out. Also, flash + mirror = glare.
* Clean your camera lens. If you're using your bathroom mirror, clean that too.
* A good camera/lens helps a lot, but not as much as good light. A shot taken outdoors with good natural lighting in the golden hour with a point and shoot will look much better than one taken inside with a DSLR using the on-camera flash.


Here are two pictures taken with the same camera, of the same outfit demonstrating the importance of light:

* [Handheld through a mirror with typical household lighting, mostly coming from behind.](http://imgur.com/tmKqt.jpg)
* [Using a tripod with lots of natural light coming from the side.](http://i.imgur.com/yTRkJ.jpg) 

**Fit Check:**

This is for when you're looking for input on how an outfit fits/looks. The most important thing is to give people a clear, accurate view of how the clothes look on you. 

* **Keep your hands out of your pockets!** Leave them both relaxed at your sides (or one if the other hand is holding the camera). 
* [Stand in a straight, natural pose facing the camera. Don't suck in your stomach or pull your shoulders back.](http://i.imgur.com/PCYHj.jpg)
* If possible, include additional pictures from the side and back. 
* Show the whole outfit including shoes, unless you're only interested in a shirt/jacket. 
* Ideally, use a camera with a timer/remote instead of a mirror (there are apps for most phones that can set a delay and number of pics to take, such as Photo Timer for the iphone). 
* For god's sake don't post a picture that needs to be rotated 90 degrees.
* If you're holding the camera, keep your elbows close to your body. Raising your elbow to the side will lift the body of a jacket or coat, distorting the fit. 
* People aren't used to seeing outfits from waist level. Position the camera at least chest high, preferably neck high. Your proportions will look odd if the camera is too low.
* If your clothes are dark, lighting is doubly important.
* If it's a suit or jacket, wear it with a dress shirt and shoes. Also button it. Leave the bottom button undone on a two or three button suit.

**Show-off:**

This is for cases where you're not really looking for a fit check, you just want to show an outfit off on WAYWT.

* Lighting is still the most important thing. If you're outside, the best time is morning or evening (the so-called ""golden hour"") when the sun is low and will give everything great dimension.
* Try different poses. It's okay to put your hand in your pocket or stand in 3/4 profile if you're not getting a fit check. 
* Use a tripod and timer/remote. It makes it much easier to get a whole outfit shot and eliminates blurriness caused by unsteady hands.
* Avoid distracting backgrounds. 
* If your camera has manual controls, go for a wide aperature (low f number). This creates a shallow depth of field, which will help you stand out from the background. It also increases the shutter speed, for less motion blur.
* Have fun. Feel free to be creative. Don't take this too seriously.

It's been awhile. I was having a bit of an introspective moment today looking through old photos and thought it'd be interesting to share an album of every pic I could find that captures something about my style at that particular moment in time and give you guys an update on where I am now.

Some of you may remember me from the MFA days of old. For you newcomers, I'll give you a quick veroz 101. I discovered MFA in early 2010 after coming to the realization that I was still wearing clothes I wore in highschool (I was 24 at the time. Now 27). In my process of learning, I posted a bunch of original content like [my style evolution](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/fkgxo/i_would_say_my_sense_of_fashion_hasevolved_over/), [a review of Trunk Club](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/gyg6z/i_got_my_first_trunk_from_trunk_club_what_are/), [the importance of shoes](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/hmguv/shoes_are_80_of_your_outfit_discuss/), and dumb stuff like my [dress me up](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/hnxmm/lets_have_some_fun_name_an_occasion_and_i_will/) post.

As my knowledge and participation in the community grew, I felt more equipped to dish out advice and eventually became moderator for a period of time. I organized a few meetups, posted in WAYWT religiously, helped as many people as I could (I even took guys out shopping a few times), and created the IRC channel among other things. This went on for awhile until, naturally, I started getting burnt out. My critiques became more caustic, my patience for helping new comers was wearing thin, and I found myself just being a complete dick to people who just wanted a little help dressing better. Not who I wanted to be.

So I decided to step down as moderator and take a break from MFA. Fast forward a year later and here we are. Looking through this album I see that I'm all over the place when it comes to style. It varies from contemporary menswear to post apocalyptic goth ninja shit. I think it's important to note that I always try to dress for the context of a situation. I still find myself wearing basic menswear stuff for business meetings, going out to nice restaurants, etc. The other stuff I tend to wear whenever I have no one to impress or don't need to ""fit in"" necessarily. A lot of these pics are cringe-worthy to me. That goofy-shit-eating-grin. How retarded boot tucking looks with my proportions. But whatever. I'm glad I have these pictures to learn from my mistakes.

I feel like now I have a better understanding of my style. Instead of ""dressing up for the internet"", I just wear whatever I feel like and it feels good. Before MFA, I wore a lot of black and stupid shit on my wrists. Now I'm wearing even more black with even more stupid shit on my wrists. But it's more refined, I think. I'm not the greatest dresser still, but that's ok. I don't get worked up anymore because I see someone wearing bad shoes. People are just at different stages in their life and, who knows, fashion might not even be a priority for them. It's stupid to judge people on looks alone.

MFA has always been a great community because it's so incredibly approachable. I am so grateful looking back and appreciate the fact that you guys put up with all my shit fits, the circlejerking, and were able to give advice without destroying my self confidence. It feels silly to say, but MFA has changed my life. I've made a bunch of friends on here and still feel connected to the community even though I don't participate that much anymore.

I'm just ranting at this point, but hopefully you've derived something useful from this post. If you care to follow my progression, you can find me on:

Consider this my return to MFA. I think there's an opportunity to inject a little more variety in the posts.

1367786618.0,859,self.malefashionadvice,1dr04d,Spring/Summer Guide to Nightclub Wear,1250,391,340,http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/1dr04d/springsummer_guide_to_nightclub_wear/,"I've been wanting to make a guide for a while now.  I noticed that every once in a while we get nightclub wear questions so I figured I'd make a guide.  I'm going to keep things on the trashier side of the spectrum, think [this](http://i.imgur.com/b7Yu74n.jpg) and [this.](http://i.imgur.com/aWJbiiF.jpg)

Ok, to preface, I think the two most important parts to nightlcub wear is selecting clothes which won't get you turned away and those which are slim fitting and create a good silhouette for your body.

I'm not saying you should overdress, but it's important to err on the side of overdressed when it comes to the dress code.  If the website doesn't specify if sneakers are allowed, call and find out or wear shoes.  Nothing is worse than waiting on line outside for an hour then finding out they won't let you in because you wore your Jordans.  Your friends will be pissed off at you if everyone has to go somewhere else as a result and you'll be upset at the time you wasted.

Emphasizing a good silhouette is very important because it's going to be dark; nobody will be able to see the exact details of what you're wearing, however the silhouette will be visible and largest determining factor as whether you are well dressed or not.

Let's get specific:

**Pants:**

I like to wear jeans, so will the majority of the people there.  If you're going with the jeans route, as you could probably guess you want dark wash.  IMO, [Levi's 513's](http://us.levi.com/product/index.jsp?productId=11694071&amp;&amp;cp=3146842.3146854.11326986) or [511's](http://us.levi.com/product/index.jsp?productId=11628403&amp;&amp;cp=3146842.3146854.3691990) are going to be your best bet, which style is dependent on your build.  They're both slim fitting, yet not overly so.  If you have larger calves go with the 513's as they give you a little extra room.  I would stay away from 514's as they have a large leg opening which will create a poor silhouette and give off a bootcut/bell bottom look.  

Some of you might be asking, ""I have my perfectly fitting pair of 3Sixteens, why don't I just wear those?"".  **Don't do it.**  Someone's going to spill some shit all over you (probably cranberry vodka).  Then you'll be that guy crying in the bathroom trying to spot clean your jeans.  Unless you're willing to wash the jeans afterwards, leave the raws at home.  I've made that mistake and it sucks.

Chinos are also OK.  Just keep it dark, think charcoal or navy.  I'd go with the reliable [Uniqlo](http://www.uniqlo.com/us/store/lifewear/men-slim-fit-chino-flat-front-pants/075305-12-038?ref=mens-clothing%2Fmens-bottoms%2Fmens-pants) as they will be affordable and slim fitting. 

**Shirt:** 

I'd go with a [button down](http://www.brooksbrothers.com/White-Wash-Shirt/MG00846,default,pd.html?dwvar_MG00846_Color=GREY&amp;contentpos=7&amp;cgid=0297) with the sleeves rolled and untucked.  Just make sure it's a slim fitting button down.  If you're not going to tailor the shirt, size down.  As I said before, silhouette is very important.  If the sleeves are too small, you're going to be rolling them anyway.  If it's a bit shorter then you would've liked, that's fine shorter is better then longer IMO when you're going untucked.  [Here's a good pic showing length dfference](http://i.imgur.com/CpFXMLW.jpg).  Even if the guy with the well fitting shirt had an inch less of fabric it's be passable.  If it's pulling a little in the chest, nobody's going to notice when you're out there out there dancing anyway.

Note 1- Don't be afraid to unbutton your shirt two (three is probably too much but it varies by shirt) buttons.  You want to look like your comfortable and not stuffy and unapproachable.  You're at a trashy nightclub, not work... go with it.

Note 2- Plaid.  There's going to be a lot of plaid, probably a bunch of your buddies will be wearing plaid too.  Unless it's the nicest, most well fitting plaid shirt out there go with something else. 

Don't wear a [tshirt](http://i.imgur.com/zcgxUqC.jpg).  You might get turned away at the door and it looks shitty.  I'd also stay away from polos as they look off at a nightclub in my opinion.  It looks like you wanted to wear a t-shirt but needed something with a collar.

**Intermission:**

You might be saying, ""The fuck is this shit? a guide on how to wear jeans with an untucked button down?"".  Yeah, it kinda is.  Jeans and an untucked button down with the sleeves rolled up is the trashy nightclub uniform.  Don't be afraid to [get a little crazy](http://www.brooksbrothers.com/Extra-Slim-Fit-Camo-Print-Sport-Shirt/MG00691_____GREN_LRG______,default,pd.html)  with the pattern as long as it fits well and you're wearing the clothes and not letting the clothes wear you.  This gets back to the silhouette thing again, 90% of the guys there will be wearing this but with shitty fits.  You don't want to stand out through [dressing different](http://i.imgur.com/YaIwsFa.jpg), you want to stand out by having the best fitting clothes there.  Don't get me wrong, peacock a little but don't go overboard; for example avoid plaid as stated above.

**Shoes:**

Like I said before, be careful with sneakers.  A lot of places will turn you away, so find out with the dress code is before you go if you insist on sneakers.

However, I think a pair of club shoes is a great investment if you're going often.  By club shoes, I mean don't wear your [strands](http://imgur.com/9rOFsjC)  unless you're ok with waking up hungover the next day and finding your $350 shoes covered in drink stains and crap from people stepping on your feet.  Also, the leather sole gets really slippery if the floor is somewhat wet from a spilt drink.  When you're a bit tipsy it's really easy to fall down some stairs if you're not paying attention.

I'd get a nice low profile brown leather shoe that fit's into your budget that you don't mind trashing.  I have a pair of [Nordstrom 1901's](http://shop.nordstrom.com/s/1901-casey-longwing-derby/3289052?origin=category-personalizedsort&amp;contextualcategoryid=0&amp;fashionColor=&amp;resultback=300&amp;cm_sp=personalizedsort-_-browseresults-_-1_2_B) that I wear for this reason.  They're decent looking, affordable at $100 and relatively comfortable.  I've gone out in my CDB's before but you have to be careful since you might get your balls broken over a ""no boots"" rule.

Upping your budget to $200, can get you a pair of [Allen Edmonds Lubbocks](http://www.allenedmonds.com/aeonline/producti_SF8032_1_40000000001_-1).  Yes they're a bit pricey but they are going to be great quality and easily cleaned.  They won't look perfect after long but with some maintenance you be able to get good use out of some AE's.

On the topic of AE, I highly reccomend some of their [conditioner/cleaner](http://www.allenedmonds.com/aeonline/producti_SF570_1_40000000001_-1), it works wonders at trying to get stains and smudges off your leather shoes.  I use it on my work boots and dress shoes.

**Underwear:**

[Uniqlo low rise briefs](http://www.uniqlo.com/us/store/lifewear/men-airism-low-rise-boxer-briefs/076561-61-005?ref=mens-clothing%2Fmens-underwear-and-loungewear%2Fmens-underwear).  They won't bunch up under your pants and will make your junk look great for when you're showing it off to whoever you met in the club that night.

**Undershirt:**

[2-Xist deep V](http://shop.2xist.com/product/X1041/).  Unless you don't sweat, wear an undershirt.  Sweat stains will ruin your entire outfit.  The deep V is very nice as it will allow you to unbutton a bunch on your button down.

**Socks:**

Anything but [white athletic socks.](http://i.imgur.com/0dLdEIw.jpg)  Get a crazy pair if you're into that, nobody can see them anyway.  

**Accessories:**

I highly recommend wearing a watch to the club as it is much less obnoxious than pulling out your cell phone to check the time.  You can't go wrong with the MFA favorite, [Timex Weekender](http://i.imgur.com/I48nEv1.jpg), it's affordable, offers excellent lume and is almost impossible to lose thanks to the nato strap.  Watches also provide a nice feel when you're [getting your fist pump on.](http://i.imgur.com/79nq7HG.gif)

Don't wear a hat.

Wear a belt.

Ties are a bit tougher to incorporate.  As it's a spring/summer guide I didn't touch upon layering at all.  IMO, ties look off when they're not layered under a jacket or sweater of some sort.  I'd avoid the ties for now and save them for the fall/winter.

**Enfin:**

As you gathered, night club wear is really easy and fairly predictable.  Keep it simple and well fitting and you'll be good to go.  You want to be confident in what you're wearing because if you're not it will be apparent to the people around you.  Have fun and [be safe](http://i.imgur.com/EOoLgHp.jpg) out there.

I think incorporating a blazer into a casual outfit though is much more difficult because a lot of this is uncharted waters. Now, I should define what I mean by casual. To some people [this](http://cdn.styleforum.net/7/76/900x900px-LL-76760cbf_IMAG0567.jpeg) is casual, and while that guy looks good, most people in their 20s (most of MFA) would not consider that casual.

[Here's an inspiration album](http://imgur.com/a/Utrcq) to give an idea of what I mean by casual, and what kind of outfits are possible by wearing a blazer outside the rules of classical menswear.

I'm about to list some general guidelines but incorporating a blazer into a casual outfit still kind of falls into a grey area of subjective taste where the main rule to follow is ""don't look like an idiot"". Unfortunately, ""don't look like an idiot"" is a pretty bad rule to give beginners because they have very limited exposure to what makes something good vs bad, so please experiment and proceed with caution.

That being said, here are some general guidelines.

* Avoid blazers with lots of structure and shoulder padding. Soft shoulders and unstructured blazers have a ""softer"" appearance. The lines are a little less clean and neat, which create a more casual silhouette. [structured](http://i.imgur.com/YoFktQW.jpg) vs [unstructured](http://i.imgur.com/yqsJlzP.jpg)

* Avoid worsted wools and odd suit jackets. For one, odd suit jackets tend to be pretty structured and cut longer. Throw out the rule that a jacket must cover your butt. Business suits tend to be worsted wools with a smoother sheen, so opt for a fabric with more texture like linen, tweed, cotton, or washed cotton.

* Avoid wool pants. Most wool pants are dress pants and induce thoughts of business casual, and we don't want that. Stick to jeans, chinos, or shorts if you're feeling next level.

* Avoid collared shirts. The main reason I say this is because an untucked shirt looks more casual than a tucked shirt, and 99% of collared shirts [look horrible](http://i.imgur.com/mPnjXPd.jpg) untucked with a blazer. It really throws off your proportions. The only way to make this work in my opinion is if the shirt is really [cropped](http://i.imgur.com/1wnWKj1.jpg), but you probably don't have a shirt like that. So instead of a collared shirt opt for a turtleneck, low cut v-neck, or scoop neck shirt or sweater. [Crew necks](http://i.imgur.com/HKQPI5O.png) can work, but are not ideal in my opinion. I also think that 99% of graphic tees look horrible underneath blazers, but there are exceptions.

* Avoid dress shoes. Opt for more casual shoes like desert boots, chelsea boots, espadrilles, nice clean sneakers, etc. Sneakers can be a bit tricky, I would avoid anything that looks beat up or sporty like New Balance or Nike Airs and go for something more clean and minimal like Vans, Chucks, or sigh...Common Projects.

These are all just different ways to make your outfit more casual, you don't need to hit all of them in order for it to work. At the end of the day you're just going to have to develop a sense of what works and what doesn't within the confines of your wardrobe (this actually goes for all articles of clothing). If anyone else has tips feel free to share them.

----

Some more background, if you need a refresher:

OF&amp;FC was intended to be as beginner-friendly as possibly - we even used Reddit's new Competition Mode to hide up/downvotes and randomly sort the top-level comments every time the page reloaded.  [You can read the origin of it in the January 27th General Discussion thread.](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/17dhge/general_discussion_jan_27th/c84hj5z)

We also tried to make WAYWT more overtly competitive, by encouraging people to post adventurous fits and improve their photography.  That was happening anyway, so I think we saw this as a recognition of an organic process, rather than a real change to WAYWT.

Additionally, we started removing generic ""What do you think of this outfit"" and ""How'd I do"" posts, with a comment that redirected people to the new OF&amp;FC threads:

&gt;Howdy! For the next few days, we're trying a new thread on MFA called Outfit Feedback &amp; Fit Check, which will be posted on Tuesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays, and Sundays at noon Eastern. [If you're curious, you can read more about the new thread and our motivation for creating it over here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/17dhge/general_discussion_jan_27th/c84hj5z)

This is for shipping purposes, as well as to keep the coat hanging flat while at the store.

So, everyone, when you get a new suit or coat:

* Unstitch the jacket's pockets (best accomplished with a seam ripper)
* Remove the tack stitches from the jacket's vent or vents
* Remove the little embroidered label from the jacket's left sleeve

I've seen countless boys, adolescents, young adults, and full-grown men who do not know to do this. It is the sartorial equivalent of keeping the protective plastic wrapping on your sofa and absolutely kills any panache your outfit otherwise had.

1353510118.0,789,self.malefashionadvice,13kg48,Guide: Basic Blazer/Trouser Combinations,965,176,192,http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/13kg48/guide_basic_blazertrouser_combinations/,"The blazer/sports jacket paired with odd trousers style is a cornerstone of modern male fashion - dressy enough to work in the office or at a bar whilst still being casual enough for weekend wear and coffee with friends. Unlike a more conventionally composed suit, the jacket/trousers combination offers immense opportunity for self-expression and fun. Choosing the right combinations however, can be a daunting and tricky prospect with a lot of room for error. In light of this, I've thrown together a quick reference guide and a few albums to highlight arguably the best and safest options available. Note that whilst I've tried to avoid influencing it overly with my personal opinions but this is hard to avoid and as such there will be plenty of disagreement. That's ok!

The colours discussed mostly refer to *solid* colours as patterns introduce a whole new layer of complexity. In general though, most patterned jackets are dominated by one major colour and can be matched in much the same way. Patterns do allow for a lot more freedom as well, breaking up harder colours and allowing for more innovative and daring combinations.

As a general rule of thumb, **dark jackets** and **light trousers** are the easiest combination to work with. The other way around is a bold look that can very easily look bad done wrong and light-light/dark-dark is certainly the most challenging. Attention and diligence to the shades of both items involved is crucial - too close and you will create a mess. Too far apart and your outfit risks looking disconnected or disproportionate. A very dark jacket and a very light pair of trousers can make one look unreasonably top-heavy. A good way to fix this is by paying attention to the cut of the jacket - a shorter jacket with more open quarters will alleviate and modernise the look. Good if you want to wear a navy jacket with white trousers, for example.

**Navy Jackets - [Album](http://imgur.com/a/GqjqC)**

The classic for a reason. Terribly versatile colour that provides the foundation for all manner of outfits.

Combines well with:

* **Charcoal** - a classic British public school look. Risks looking safe but boring unless the fit and details are more modern.

* **Med/Light Grey**

* **Khaki** - An American business staple.

* **White** - A summery, somewhat preppy style. Shorter and tighter jackets work well.

* **Brown**

---

**Blue Jackets - [Album](http://imgur.com/a/SGti4)**

A much more uncommon and vibrant colour for jackets, it's a bold and rather Italian style that looks good with soft shoulders and tight (often *too* tight) tailoring. Almost exclusively a summer colour.

Looks good with:

* **White** - perfect *#menswear* summer look.

* **Khaki**

* **Grey** - Lighter greys work better in my opinion, but a darker grey with a light blue jacket is ok too.

* **Other blues** - Depending on the shade of the jacket - there should be a clear contrast between the two. Navy looks great under a light blue jacket.

---

**Grey/Charcoal Jackets - [Album](http://imgur.com/a/zdhRE)**

Contrary to instinct grey and especially charcoal solid colour single jackets are some of the least versatile choices of the lot. A very commonly seen colour but often very poorly used and understood. Its lack of colour limit it mostly to other shades within the white-grey-charcoal spectrum. Khaki works ok too. In general, if you're buying your first sports coat I'd steer well clear. Charcoal is especially limited, lacking the softness of grey it's restricted mostly to pairings with lighter greys.

Works with:

* **Other Greys**: Charcoal for grey jackets, grey for charcoal jackets. Be careful of going too light in shade.

* **White/Cream**: One of the better combinations available - spring/summer only. Pay close attention to the shades involved - lighter greys are much more preferable. Charcoal is too much.

* **Khaki** - Not especially exciting

A grey jacket on navy or brown trousers is pretty dire, avoid.

---

**Brown Jackets - [Album](http://imgur.com/a/cxwlm)**

A somewhat under-appreciated colour, brown is really versatile and great for the autumn/winter seasons. Brown jackets frequently feature heavy fabrics (flannel, tweed) and strong patterning.

* **Charcoal/Grey**

* **White** - Can be very crisp

* **Olive** - A bolder, more playful combination which reinforces the autumnal/country aesthetic

* **Other shades of brown** - tricky to do well, strong patterns and colours help.

---

**Khaki/Tan/Beige Jackets - [Album](http://imgur.com/a/dgKAu)**

Another colour much more suited to the summer, a lightweight (perhaps cotton or linen) tan jacket is pretty easy to combine with other summery trousers.

Works well with:

* **White/Cream** - I think cream is nicer with tan personally.

* **Grey/Charcoal** - Lighter greys go great for a more subdued look. Charcoal can work well too, but beware of your proportions. Heavier fabrics look better with charcoal. 

* **Brown** - darker than the tan of the jackets. Can risk looking stuffy depending on the cut and the style (see Bond)

* **Olive** and other pastels for a bolder approach

---

**Olive/Greens Jackets - [Album](http://imgur.com/a/ItOBI)**

The most underrated colour for a autumn/winter sports jacket in my opinion, it's impressively versatile and can look great. Finding the right shade of olive/green is a nightmare though - too strong or vivid and it'll border on ridiculous. Some crossover with brown.

* **Grey/Charcoal**

* **Khaki/Beige**

* **Browns** - an earthy combination

---

**Black Jackets/Black Trousers**

Probably best not to buy or wear black jackets or trousers. They pretty much don't successfully go with anything else. A black suit at least has some purpose (evening events, funerals), but black solo pieces don't. They're too dominant and aggressive to play nice - either contrasting or overwhelming any other colour. They demand too much attention visually to be a safe or coherent combination.",,False,self,t5_2r65t,1353512969.0,,,True,t3_13kg48,http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/13kg48/guide_basic_blazertrouser_combinations/,

With that in mind, you should give some thought to the kind of bag you'll be carrying around daily.

Typically, you'll want to have [contrast](http://i.imgur.com/hQZYU6o.jpg) between your clothes and your bag, though it's also possible to try for a [monochrome](http://i.imgur.com/VEbYs5d.jpg) look.

Typically, this means you'll be looking for plain, versatile colors, like grey, navy, charcoal, burgundy and black. If you're getting a leather bag, most shades of brown will work well, depending on your wardrobe.

However, this isn't a rule written in stone. There's nothing wrong with buying a unique backpack that you love, like [this](http://i.imgur.com/Cu1KwQz.jpg) or [this](http://i.imgur.com/qeXLBnf.jpg). However, understand that it might not work as well with your wardrobe. Furthermore, if it's a loud backpack, be wary of wearing it often: the novelty will wear off, and it will eventually come off as ""tacky"" to people that see it too often.

* What will I use it for?

Use common sense. Choose a bag that suits your needs, whether you're bringing two notebooks and a folder to class, or if you're going backpacking through Europe for a month. Also take into account the situations you'll need it for: a leather briefcase isn't a good choice for a high school student, nor is it a good idea to wear a backpack with a suit/blazer.

Similarly, you should make sure your bag is big enough to hold everything you need (e.g., your 17"" laptop), while staying at a manageable weight. Saddleback bags, for instance, can get pretty heavy. Be sure to take into account whether you'll need to carry your bag around all day or whether you just need it for the commute to work.

Also, be sure to prioritize function over form. If you have scoliosis or suffer from back/shoulder pain or otherwise have difficulty wearing messenger bags, don't buy them.

**Types of Bags:**

---

**Backpacks:** 

For high school and college students, I'd say this is probably the best and most versatile option. You can wear them with anything short of a blazer/suit, they're convenient to carry around, and they'll have room to carry your books, a laptop, and whatever else you might need. Even if you aren't a student anymore, backpacks are still versatile and pretty useful for commuting and travel, especially for day trips to the city. Don't worry about looking juvenile, as there are a variety of styles to choose from, ranging from [classic canvas bags](http://i.imgur.com/EtapSlV.jpg) to more [technical and urban options](http://i.imgur.com/XnpOGwc.jpg). It's hard to imagine these styles as juvenile, though it is true that [some backpacks](http://i.imgur.com/lU2620W.jpg) give off a more youthful vibe than others.

**Canvas backpacks** work well with more classic types of styles, such as americana, heritage workwear, prep, and bizcaz styles. For beginners, I would recommend buying a canvas backpack. They are more versatile, as they work well among the pieces of the basic wardrobe. Check out this [visual compilation](http://i.imgur.com/FVh4meL.jpg) of [classic canvas backpacks](http://redd.it/1jf86y/) for a couple of possibilities to consider. If you happen to like a certain backpack, but it's out of your price range, I'd recommend looking into the brand for similar and possibly cheaper options.

On the other hand, **urban backpacks** happen to work well for different styles, including streetwear and techwear. If you're more into that, I'd recommend this style of backpack. While some of these bags may not be as versatile in general, they can still work well among a variety of outfits within the streetwear/techwear style. Plus, some of them are pretty fucking cool. Black is a popular color, as that backpack color works particularly well in monochrome fits, and it contrasts nicely with most tops/jackets. /u/rjbman did a great [compilation](http://i.imgur.com/xCbQOlN.jpg) of [urban backpacks](http://redd.it/1jqlm7/) for your consideration. 

For more inspiration, take a look at this [album](http://imgur.com/a/yRmC9), and check out more cool backpacks [here](http://badassbackpack.tumblr.com/).

**Messenger bags:** 

Messenger bags serve the same role as backpacks do, though they tend to work better for college students and older. This is because messengers work better with ""dressier"" styles, such as prep and bizcaz. If you like wearing peacoats, cardigans, OCBDs + jeans/chinos often, this might be the right style of bag for you. The two major options to choose between are leather messengers and canvas messenger bags.

**Canvas messengers** are a more casual option and are better suited for class/travel than the workplace, though this varies from bag to bag. Many are actually waxed canvas, which is a nice feature that makes them waterproof/water resistant. Note that it's also possible to make your own waxed canvas bag, as /u/kerodean shows [here](http://redd.it/wxa0m/).

Closely related are the **""technical"" messenger bags**, made by brands like timbuk2. While they may be lightweight/durable/whatever, I will recommend against them, as most of their offerings simply aren't fashionable in terms of aesthetic design and in outfit versatility. This is neither a blanket ban on timbuk2, nor is it a set-in-stone rule. Feel free to ignore it, but you do so at your own risk!

**Leather messengers** are the more formal option, and play a similar role to briefcases. They work well for post-undergrad students, and can be office-appropriate. When looking for a leather messenger bag, you should look for ""full-grain"" or ""top-grain"" leather goods, as opposed to ""genuine leather"". This is because genuine leather is actually pretty crappy leather, and won't age well compared to the higher quality leathers. However, the drawback to requiring higher quality is the higher price. Also be sure to pay careful attention to the weight of the bag - leather bags can be heavy.

If you're interested in looking for a messenger bag of your own, /u/failspy did a cool [infographic compilation](http://i.imgur.com/Rzsws.jpg) of messenger bags [here](http://redd.it/14kx63/). Also check out this [album](http://imgur.com/a/tu1uE) for a few more messenger bag options.

---

**Briefcases/Carpenter Bags:** 

Briefcases and carpenter bags are really more suited for the workplace and travel, as opposed to the more casual nature of the backpack and messenger bag. Briefcases, especially leather ones, really require at least a business casual level of formality, and they look fantastic when worn with a suit. As for canvas briefcases and carpenter bags, they aren't quite as formal, but you should at least be wearing dark wash denim and a buttondown to match the level of formality.

If you're in the market for a **leather briefcase**, again, you should really be looking at full-grain leather briefcases over the crappy ""genuine leather"" offerings. While it is more expensive, full-grain leather is higher quality, more durable, and will age well - check out how [this Saddleback briefcase](http://i.imgur.com/oD7fnB2.jpg) has aged, for instance. Don't cheap out on something that you'll be carrying around for years!

For more awesome briefcase pics, check out this [album](http://imgur.com/a/6pA03), and a related [styleforum thread](http://www.styleforum.net/t/34253/briefcase-porn-thread/0_40)!

---

**Weekenders/Duffel Bags:** 

Weekenders and duffel bags are different from the other types of bags in the sense that you shouldn't be carrying them around daily. Weekenders, as the name suggests, are travel bags that can carry exactly the right amount of stuff for a weekend getaway. Duffel bags serve a similar purpose, and they're handy for carrying a bunch of stuff, like your gym apparel. But while they might not be carried around as often, it's never a bad idea to travel in style. Most options come in canvas or leather, though I personally prefer canvas as they'll be lighter and therefore easier to carry. 

If you'd like to see more weekender bags to choose from, /u/failspy also did a cool [infographic compilation](http://i.imgur.com/GVJ47.jpg) for weekenders/duffel bags [here](http://redd.it/14igfk), and there's also [this album](http://imgur.com/a/uexo2) to look at.

**Other Types of Bags**

**Tote Bags** could be a useful option if you need to tote a bunch of stuff around, like groceries or stuff for the beach. Though it has feminine connotations, there are a few examples that could work for guys: [check](http://i.imgur.com/Sm4CInB.jpg) [these](http://i.imgur.com/uSVXTX1.jpg) [out](http://i.imgur.com/X1qFtJG.jpg).

**Drawstring Bags** are also a more functional kind of bag, rather than stylish - if you need a lightweight bag to carry a few small things around, this would be useful. However, don't expect it to be fashionable - most of them are made out of cheap nylon, and tend to be worn by high school seniors with senioritis.

I'd like to introduce you to a couple affordable, but quality, watches.

**SUBMARINER**

I'm sure all of you know what a submariner is. If you want a nice sumbariner homage and don't want to spend a lot of money, look at these two:  

CASIO MDV106 - priced around $40 it's a steal. Quartz movement.

* [with steel bracelet](http://i.imgur.com/Z1RSUaV.jpg)
* [with ""james bond"" nato strap](http://i.imgur.com/m9s6Uj4.jpg)

Invicta 9026OB - this has very good automatic movement for the price, Seiko NH35A. It feels heavy and firm on your hand, bracelet is good quality. Goes for $85

* [with steel bracelet](http://i.imgur.com/X0Y6jwu.jpg)
* [with ""james bond"" nato again](http://i.imgur.com/fnbTc3y.jpg)

**PANERAI Luminor style**

You may not know this watch, but it's gorgeous. First, let's see the original (which costs thousands)

* [Original Panerai](http://i.imgur.com/zUP2FEy.jpg)

But fear not! There is a guy, who makes Panerai homage watches for under $100 They're mechanic, have great finish and overall feel great on your wrist. Look:

* [Marina Militare Panerai homage](http://i.imgur.com/yT5UC9v.jpg)
* [Sterile Panerai homage](http://i.imgur.com/Pmq92fm.jpg)

You can get those watches either from [getat](http://www.siswatch727.com/index.do) or [manbushije](http://www.manbushijie.com/) (register for better prices) edit: these are **not** replica watches.

I know many more affordable watches, but each of them has a separate category. If you're looking for a **really** cheap watch, that may last only a year or so, look for brands like EYKI, FINEAT. Less cheap, but better: RODINA and ALPHA

- [L.L. Bean Black Watch Flannel, $39.95](http://www.llbean.com/llb/shop/42272?feat=589-GN1&amp;page=scotch-plaid-flannel-shirt&amp;attrValue_0=Black%20Watch). For those of you too antsy to wait for Uniqlo to stock their fall items and want to catch the [Black Watch train, LL Bean](http://imgur.com/LrL3PI9) offers a decent-quality option. If you've signed up for their emails, it's possible there's a $10-off coupon kicking around in your spam folder, taking this down to $29.95. Note that, of course, LL Bean runs large/baggy, so consider sizing down.

- LEC [Slim Fit](http://www.landsend.com/products/mens-5-pocket-slim-fit-cords/id_247115) or [Straight Fit](http://www.landsend.com/products/mens-5-pocket-straight-fit-cords/id_247112) [Corduroy pants, ~~$39.99~~ $27.99 with 30% off promo code!](http://imgur.com/9KNT57y).

- [H&amp;M Cotton fine-knit v-neck sweater, $10 TODAY ONLY](http://www.hm.com/us/product/11122?article=11122-E#article=11122-E). A great, [basic layering piece](http://imgur.com/nK8cliV), good for biz-caz. Blue and gray are your best bets.

- [JCP Arizona Slub Henley, $7.94 (XL, XXL only - possibly available in other sizes in-store according to a source)](http://www.jcpenney.com/dotcom/juniors-guys/view-all-guys/sale/arizona-slub-henley-t-shirt/prod.jump?ppId=pp5002190810&amp;catId=cat100560018&amp;N=100560284&amp;Nao=24&amp;pN=2&amp;extDim=true&amp;topDim=Categories&amp;topDimvalue=casual+shirts&amp;dimCombo=Categories).

*****
I’ve been seeing a metric fuckton of posts about dressing college students, high school seniors, and whatnot.  The current sidebar guide to the basic wardrobe might be slightly dated and it doesn’t really cover where to get these so called basics, so here it is an updated guide.  

This guide applies to **all** ages, body types, social standings, or self-perceived personal archetypes.  This guide just lists the absolute **BASICS** and will point to some budget-minded options for this.  Yes, I know about other articles of clothing like chinos and cords, but this guide is for the noobs.  Read this guide understanding that a lot of noobs can't afford $150 Gitman shirts, or $300 for sick Ervell knits.  Remember though, generally, you get what you pay for.

Before you say this guide isn’t for me I’m in middle school, high school, college, graduate school, fucking read the guide. 

Side note: **Fit is fucking king**, nothing can make cheap clothes look better like a good fit, and conversely, nothing can make expensive clothes look like shit like a bad fit.  Tagged clothing size varies widely by manufacturer, a small isn't always a small and a large might be a medium.

**SECTION I – THE BLUE JEAN**

The mother fucking blue jean, the most basic piece of workwear and staple to any man’s wardrobe you can imagine.  Anyone can fucking wear these.

* [**Levi’s 501** – Clean Rigid - $42.99](http://www.amazon.com/Levis-Mens-Original-Stonewash-36x32/dp/B0018ON49G/ref=sr_1_1?s=apparel&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1314943420&amp;sr=1-1) – A cornerstone of fucking Americana, the original ass cut, which has been recut as shit.  The original 501 fit closer to what the 511 is today.  Wear these if you’re a bigger dude.

**SECTION II – THE SHIRT**
*****
Someone said that a shirt’s collar frames the face, which is kinda fucking important cause people look at your face.  For this reason I prefer V-necks, plain ass fucking V-necks, maybe some solid colors here and there.  Graphic tees you ask?  Wear them at your own risk, you’re probably half as cool as you think and when you wear a graphic tee you look a third as cool as half you think.

* [**Mossimo V-Neck Tees** - $7.99]( http://www.target.com/p/Mossi-Men-s-Ss-Tee-Lauren-Blue/-/A-13312417) – Multiple colors – you can find these at target, they’re slim fitting and v-necked. 
There are however other shirts available too, collared button down shirts.  But you say, “Collared shirts are too mature for me, I’m too young for that.”  I say, “Bullshit asshole, nobody likes the tuna here, unless you’re still swimming in your mom’s womb, you’re old enough to wear collared button downs.
* [**Mossimo Polos** - $9.99]( http://www.target.com/p/Mossimo-174-Polo-Jetstream-Blue/-/A-13184953) – Multiple colors, another basic, less versatile than collared button downs.  Many types are availables, these ones from target are easy.

**Button Ups** – Stick with long sleeved versions for now, wait till you grow some balls before you make the transition.  Keep em’ slim fitting and close to the body, off the rack shirts will typically need tailoring.  Generally speaking, thicker and heavier weaves are more casual (oxford and twill) and lighter weaves more formal (poplin and broadcloth).  There are exceptions to these rules, but this is just a guideline

* [**Lands End Canvas**]( http://canvas.landsend.com/ix/canvas/Canvas/Sale/Men/Tops/Shirts/index.html?seq=1~2~3~4~5~6&amp;catNumbers=2198~2471~2509~2516~2799&amp;visible=1~1~1~1~1~1&amp;store=le&amp;sort=Price%3A+low+to+high&amp;pageSize=72&amp;tab=17) – They have sales on all the time, the shirts aren’t the slimmest, but safe.
* **Alfani Red** [**“Dress Shirts”** - $20-$30]( http://www1.macys.com/search/results.ognc?sortOption=*&amp;Keyword=alfani%20red&amp;resultsPerPage=24&amp;Action=sd&amp;attrs=Department:Department:Dress+Shirt) - [**“Sport Shirts”** - $20-$30]( http://www1.macys.com/search/results.ognc?sortOption=*&amp;Keyword=alfani%20red&amp;resultsPerPage=24&amp;Action=sd&amp;attrs=Department:Department:Shirts) – These are decent slim shirts on a budget, dress shirts are usually longer and have to be tucked in.  Prices vary between $20-$30 and a lot of sales go on.

**SECTION II – THE LAYERS**
*****
Like Ned Stark loves to say, “Winter is coming.”  So what the fuck do you wear?  I like sweaters and cardigans, maybe a hoodie here or there.  We’ll save the pea coats, blazers and trenches for the heavy hitters.

* [**Merona V-Neck** - $22.99]( http://www.target.com/s?searchTerm=merona+sweater&amp;category=9976707|All|matchallany|men) – Here I am again, all up on your shit about collars framing the face, same shit applies for sweaters.  V-necks are pretty sweet, crew necks are pretty awesome too.
* [**LEC Sweaters, Cardigans** - $20-35]( http://canvas.landsend.com/ix/Men/Sale/UserSearch=sweater/index.html?seq=2~3~1&amp;catNumbers=2200~2473&amp;visible=1~1~1&amp;store=lecanvas&amp;sort=Recommended&amp;pageSize=24) - Cardigans are versatile as fuck for layering.  They definitely give off a more mature vibe, but think of the people who wear em’ James Bond, Mr. Rogers, Jimmy Carter, manly as fuck.
* [**American Apparel Cardigans** - $22]( http://www.ebay.com/itm/RSA4400-American-Apparel-Baby-Rib-Cardigan-ANY-COLOR-SZ-/130509800228?pt=US_CSA_MC_Sweaters&amp;var=&amp;hash=item641f289865) – Simple and basic, what is said above applies.
* [**American Apparel Hoodies** - $30]( http://www.ebay.com/itm/F497-American-Apparel-Flex-Fleece-Zip-HOODY-ANY-CLR-SZ-/130498180989?pt=US_Mens_Sweats_Hoodies&amp;var=&amp;hash=item641f113bb0) – These are raw as fuck.  Some people may say hoodies are immature, but I don’t think a slim fitting solid hoodie really look that bad.  These are for you college kids and youngsters.

**SECTION IV – THE SHOES**
*****
Ah shoes, fucking shoes.  Before I learned how to dress myself, I had a pair of ratty ass athletic nikes, some flip flops and some bulky ass dress shoes.  Shoes are great, however shoes are kinda fucking expensive, so I’m only going over some cheap basics.

* **Canvas Sneakers** -  [**Converse Chuck Taylor All Star** - $45]( http://www.zappos.com/converse-chuck-taylor-all-star-core-ox-optical-white) - [**Vans Authentic** - $45]( http://www.zappos.com/vans-authentic-core-classics-true-white) – These are basic ass low-top canvas sneakers, they usually look good with jeans and other casual outfits.  White is usually the safest color, I recommend Optical White for Chucks and True White for Vans. 
* **Boat Shoes** - [**Sperry Authentic Originals** - $75](http://www.zappos.com/sperry-top-sider-authentic-original-classic-brown) – Boat shoes, some people say they’re kind of a southern fratty thing, but they’re a classic and they can fit in wherever you can wear canvas sneakes.  Classic Brown is a great color, $75 at Zappos.
* **Desert Fucking Boots** - [**Clarks** $60-80]( http://www.amazon.com/Clarks-Originals-Mens-Desert-Oakwood/dp/B0031Y6UXI/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1314947190&amp;sr=8-1) – These are fucking parroted left and right here and I’ll recommend them again.  The **Beeswax** are inoffensive looking chukka boots at a reasonable price.  They go well with jeans and chinos. 

**SECTION V – ACCESSORIES**
*****
Accessories, the little details, sometimes these make a fucking outfit, but leave that to the pros.  Two basic accessories that can work for any man are a belt and a watch.

* [**The Timex Weekender** - $40]( http://www.timex.com/s?searchKeywords=timex+weekender+slip&amp;Action=submit) – Ah, the fucking NATO-strapped Timex.  The hardest circlejerk that MFA has ever experienced, but for good reason.  It’s a good looking watch, with a lot of options for being you in the strap.  Just please don’t post a picture of it when you get one.  Black faces are more casual than white watch faces.
* [**4 STR / 4 STA Leather Belt** - $35]( http://stores.ebay.com/Orion-Leather/Leather-Belts-/_i.html?_fsub=1091149014&amp;_sid=174214354&amp;_trksid=p4634.c0.m322) – I got a decent leather belt from this store on ebay.  The wider the belt the more casual, brown is generally more versatile than black, if you wear leather shoes, try to match the color with your belt.

**CLOSING THOUGHTS**
*****
Here are a few brick and mortar/mall stores which you can easily find some reasonably priced basics in person.
* [H&amp;M](http://www.hm.com) - Cheap, fast fashion.
* [Zara](http://www.zara.com) - Cheap, fast fashion.
* [Uniqlo](http://www.uniqlo.com) - Only available in New York, much more availability outside of the US.

That’s it for now.  These are just some basics, something to point you, the clueless plebe towards dressing better.  Yes, the initial cost of dressing better might be a lot, but there’s a high return on investment here.  Dressing well gives you confidence and with confidence, the world is your fucking oyster.  If people like this guide, I’ll follow up with some additional information and perhaps an intermediate guide.

If you don’t take anything else away from this guide, remember, fit is king.

All I found were [very uninformed and biased discussions](http://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=144050031&amp;page=1), or [not very in-depth circle-jerks](http://forums.khinsider.com/general-discussion/172797-official-graphic-t-shirts-thread-v2.html).

So I thought I'd make my own.
****
DISCLAIMER: This 'guide' is **my opinion** and if you disagree with me, take it up with *me*, not the rest of community.
****
In general, graphic tees are frowned upon here (to put it mildly). So I thought I'd put together a small 'guide' on graphic tees. What to avoid, what's fine and everything in between.
Until about 3 months ago, I loved graphic tees. A lot. Until I started to be more fashion conscious and tried to dress a bit smarter. This meant to designate about 60% of my graphic tees to pyjama tops or the bin. But not all are bad!

**Reasons for wearing graphic tees.**

The main reason for wearing graphic tees should **visual appeal** and **positive association**. By positive association I mean that you feel strongly about what company/band etc. you are representing and that you are proud to show this affection. If a shirt is just 'funny' then it probably isn't anything else and it isn't worth getting.

Personally, I now make sure a tee ticks both those boxes, otherwise I won't get it. Point in case is [this shirt](https://bleep.com/merch/240-flying-lotus-flying-lotus-fluro-logo-t-shirt). I love the artist, I would be proud to show my support towards him but there is no visual appeal for me. 

Overt branding can also put me off. [This shirt](http://clammyclams.com/images/white_close.jpg) is really nice from the front due to multiple reason. Firstly I like the look – good contrast, simple colour scheme and not too overpowering. Secondly it is very subtle in what it does. If you don't know the artist it's just a nice looking shirt, if you know the artist – even better. It has dual appeal, it doesn't just apply to one niche group of people. 
The back ruins it for me though. The tee has now lost it's subtly. The obvious 'Clams Casino' writing is very off putting for me. This shirt would now only be used in combination with a shirt like so. I wouldn't want to wear it without something covering the back.

Subtle branding can be quite cool, [like so](http://thisisluckyme.com/wp-content/themes/luckyme/images/storemockup//LOGO%20TEE.jpg).
This shirt is one of my all time favourites, the graphic is simple, contrasting and effective. The writing, LuckyMe, is done in a way that doesn't make it immediately obvious and so, visually appealing. Of course, if you don't love LuckyMe, this shirt loses some appeal. The shirt is perfect for me as I am very proud to support this collective. 
****
***The 3 main types of graphic tees.***
****
* *The one with the stupid pun/saying or overt branding - The worst.*

This is tee should be avoided at all times, but I don't think anyone here would wear these anyway. [Examples](http://www.allposters.co.uk/gallery.asp?aid=1629062913&amp;c=c&amp;search=44037&amp;DestType=12&amp;VTP=Start&amp;NetWorkType=g&amp;PAdCopyId=11562541813&amp;ClickPos=1t3&amp;VTP=End&amp;KWID=1159728510&amp;gclid=CNbs8b7Fxb&amp;KWID=1159728510&amp;gclid=CNbs8b7F* xbcCFWfItAodsCUAyA&amp;SEM=lang%3D100%26c%3Dc%26search%3D44037%26AID%3D1629062913%26KWID%3D1159728510%26gclid%3DCNbs8b7FxbcCFWfItAodsCUAyA)

 
* *Arty Graphics. - Usually best worn on their own.*
 
These should not be combined with other tops, like and open shirt because the aim of these tees is the print. It's the main attraction and should not be compromised. Most of the time adding layers with these types of tees looks forced. [Examples](http://imgur.com/a/Q2WPv)

I would like to single out [this one](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0074/1102/products/bucky_grande.jpg?317) as it is an interesting one, the big block of colour at the centre makes this combinable with other tops, but the details make it work perfectly good on it's own. This one bridges the gap between simple graphic and arty graphic. Of course the main focus is the arty graphic, but IMO the block of yellow makes this less cluttered than if it was all B&amp;W.
 
* *Simple graphics. - Easily combined, doesn't look bad on its own either.* 
 
These will often have very prominent graphics, which focus more on the look as a whole rather than on small details of the shirt (see Arty Graphics). 
 
These are my favourite, as I feel more confident when wearing them since they're not difficult to pull off. [Like here](http://imgur.com/a/PvMm4)

****
I would like to look at [this picture](http://i.imgur.com/9v9hFWq.jpg) in depth for a moment. I think this is one of the best ways to pull off a graphic tee. He has matched the colour of the print with the colour of his shoes (this **does not** always go well. Can only recommend with fairly subtle colours like grayscale, as /u/metcarfre pointed out). The dark jeans pair well with the jacket but have a different texture. The backpack's straps colour and style really fits into this (even though most backpacks would fit here). The watch adds a nice touch.
(EDIT: I only just found out this is /u/letigreletigre, so yeah credit goes to him!)

 I know this is meant to be a 'guide' on graphic tees, but that doesn't mean one should solely focus on them but also on how they work with and impact on the rest of the outfit.
****

***Noteworthy***

* As with all clothing, **FIT IS KING**! No matter how good it looks on the rack, if it doesn't fit it won't look half as good. 

* Quality is very important..how does the shirt feel and look after one or two washes? A good shirt will break in well and its print will stay strong.

* Wearing graphic tees doesn't mean you can be sloppy with an outift. They should still fit in with the outfit colour-wise. I believe this why people often slate graphic tees, they are just worn as a separate entity.

Thanks for reading and I hope you found it somewhat helpful. This is the first time I have done one of these so I'm not too sure how helpful it is.

Thanks for the support guys. I'm building the app. I will post in this subreddit the website, so that I can keep you guys updated!

-----------------------------------------------

I'm a UI designer and application developer.

The app will:

1. Detect what colors suit you (using seasonal color analysis).
2. Detect what style suits you (depending on your body type).
3. See reviews of products, based on people with similar seasonal color, and body type.
4. Allow you to review products and shops/sites to buy from. You can rate the style, cost, fit, and materials.
5. Allow you to see recommendations on alternative/similar items of clothing.
6. Allow you to create your own inspiration list of photos of fashionable gentlemen, and share it with your friends. You will also be able to follow other people's fashion feeds.
7. Allow you to browse, post, and comment on MFA from within the app (utilizing Reddit's API).
8. Allow you to read guides, articles, and tips on male fashion.

The goal is that you will take the app with you when you go out to a shop. It will help you find what makes you look great.

Would you use it if I made it? I want to see if there is interest, before I even make it.

PS: It would be a free app, with no advertising, if I build it. It would first off come out as an iPhone app, then either Android, or a mobile website version.",,False,self,t5_2r65t,1363525453.0,,,True,t3_1aggl8,http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/1aggl8/mobile_app_developer_here_how_would_you_guys_feel/,

1316279268.0,697,self.malefashionadvice,kirvc,"PRO TIP: As someone who stepped away from MFA for awhile, let me tell you something I have learned...",1007,310,315,http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/kirvc/pro_tip_as_someone_who_stepped_away_from_mfa_for/,"*TLDR:* Workout. Build a better body. Gain true confidence. Permeate badassery into all outfits.

---------
Let me preface this by saying I was super active on MFA for a good 6 months, and still practice refined taste in my every day fashions. But after being so engrossed in details, accessories, fabric matching, etc. I realized there is a bigger picture most guys ignore:

**FITNESS.**

Now I know most of you will say, ""Yeah, I know, but I eat *pretty well* and I walk a lot, or commute with my bike sometimes..."" And yes, I was exactly the same way. Probably underweight if anything, ride my bike everywhere, no one has ever called me unhealthy. 

But one day I decided to use some extra tip money and join a gym. I found a very basic, very low commitment (45 minutes / 3 days a week) weight lifting routine, and stuck with it. BEST INVESTMENT EVER. Skip a few pocket squares and do yourself this favor, NOW.

Benefits:

1) **Ridiculous increase in confidence.** I really had no issues with myself prior but watching yourself get better and better and better at lifting HEAVY amounts of weights really makes you feel like a true boss, coming from the INSIDE out, not the outside in (as is often the case with fashion.)

2) **Mental Discipline.** This spills over into everything in your life. When you train yourself to get your ass into the gym when you need to, to not quit when that last rep feels rough, to walk around sore as fuck for days... you develop this badass shield against petty bullshit. You will be a better friend, a better boyfriend, a better employee, etc. The benefits of a healthy, strong mind should be obvious.

3) **Clothes fit better.** Now this is something that I feel MFA needs to know about. I am a skinny fuck. (I was 5'7"" / 130lbs.) I bought smalls, XS, had to custom order suits, wear size 28 jeans, etc. After I started working out, I started eating more, increasing protein, carbs, etc. (Which is fun if you like to eat!!) 

Not only am I ""filling out"" more, but I'm doing so in a way that looks totally masculine and badass (broader shoulders, pecs, big forearms, biceps). For those fellow skinny guys out there you know that having clothes ""look right"" is a challenge, especially off the rack. Now, I can try shit on and there's a chance it is *too small*, which never used to happen. Now my shoulders fill out dress shirts better, my chest doesn't look as ""billowy"" in everything, I don't have to wear skinny jeans to look trim.

4) **Style.** We always show images of our fashion heroes, and most of them are confident, masculine men. Building a better body takes you closer to appearing like a ""real man"", as opposed to a boy dressing like a man. You're not going to pull off a Kennedy style polo shirt without some nice arms. You're not going to look like Connery with some wimpy, bad posture shoulders.

5) **You can do more shit.** This is obvious. Lift heavy shit, heavy shit becomes easier to lift. Carry your SO around like you rescued them from a fire, help a friend move without hesitation, fix shit around the house, complete chores with greater efficiency. 

All of that leads back to the first point: Confidence. Which in fashion is a huge factor. I find I can wear anything now and feel better about myself. When you get a killer outfit together you really feel like a million bucks.

---------

I know most of you won't want to hear this kinda stuff. I always ignored gym rats and guys talking about reps and their biceps and shit. But really, since we as a society are not as active as we used to be, do yourself a favor and be the best you can. Since most of the work force sits behind a computer all day, be the guy that looks so good people wonder what *you* must do for a living.

1375737994.0,694,self.malefashionadvice,1jrmmq,A comprehensive guide to the kilt,1029,335,286,http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/1jrmmq/a_comprehensive_guide_to_the_kilt/,"Right, you bunch of tuxedo-wearing pansies, it is time for a lesson in the manliest of all black-tie and formal outfits - the modern Scottish kilt. It is one of the boldest but also most endearing choices for a formal occasion, and will set tongues wagging with compliments. Trust me, it is somewhat effective. It is however an exceedingly complex attire, and should be treated and understood with the respect it commands when worn. They look astonishing on both the bulky and scrawny, and should not be overlooked by those of you with any Scottish or Celtic heritage.

As a Scotsman and also a historian, I know a worrying amount about the garment, but as this is a clothing forum, and not a history lesson, I will focus on the outfit. If you are interested in the (extremely fascinating) history behind the kilt, I wrote a good summary of the origins of the modern iteration of the kilt [here on AskHistorians](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1d4w6j/i_was_just_rewatching_braveheart_and_now_im/c9n1pqz). Now, let's dive in.

_____________________________________________________________
**Occasions**

The Modern kilt should be worn in only three settings, of which I will rank them in order of formality and appropriate-ness.

* [Formal occasions](http://www.kiltrental.com/Prom%20Black%20Watch%20kilt.jpg) - Black-tie, weddings, formals etc.
* [Scottish heritage events]( http://www.myceilidh.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/HotScotch-Monaco.jpg) - Highland games, Ceilidhs, folk bands etc.
* Scottish National football matches, as part of the tartan army - [modelled by yours truly on the right hand side](http://imgur.com/TXFvwAl) (note casual football top, thick, pulled-down socks and chunky shoes - the uniform)   

Though this is a personal view, if I ever see someone wearing a [utilikilt casually](http://www.ninjapirate.com/content/images/utilikilt4.jpg), I will ~~hit them~~ give them a disapproving look and scorn them in my head.
______________________________________________________________
**The Kilt**

The kilt itself is in its most usual form, around an 8 yard piece of wool cloth, hand-stitched and pleated to create an apron that flows eloquently, is highly durable, and provides all-important air conditioning to the nether regions. They are of course typically tartan (though you do get more modern [fashion kilts](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-F-KltaTQhHM/UbPGO_V2NHI/AAAAAAAAAG8/9IAak5oBRD4/s1600/3294046702_f63e76ebfc.jpg)), and double buckled to create the wraparound effect.

As this is more a guide on the outfit as a whole, I won't delve into the world of different clan tartans - all you need to know is that there are numerous different ones with many different styles within them, such as [Dress](http://www.scotlandshop.com/Images/Tartans/macdonald-dress-ancient-10oz-wool-tartan-swatch_lg.jpg) (more white), [Hunting]( http://www.lochcarron.com/reiver/MacA-D/mdh_a.jpg) (more Green), [Muted]( http://www.lochcarron.com/reiver/MacA-D/md_a.jpg) (more understated), and many others. These examples are all [Macdonald tartan](http://www.lochcarron.com/reiver/MacA-D/md_m.jpg), for example.

**Fit**

Kilts are worn around the belly, just below the ribs. This is a lot higher than usual trousers, so bare it in mind when sizing (my 30 inch waist translates to a 33 inch kilt size). Most importantly, the kilt should sit between the middle and top of the kneecap - no higher, no lower - [like this](http://www.kinlochanderson.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/320x427/5e06319eda06f020e43594a9c230972d/k/i/kinloch_anderson_kilt.jpg)
_____________________________________________________________
**Jackets and Waistcoats**

Kilts must always be worn with the appropriate top-half attire. There are a wide variety of kilt jackets to wear, but I will focus on the main three that you will come across - Prince Charlie Jackets, Argyll Jackets, and Day Jackets. All are woollen, and mitigate any cooling breezes downstairs by bathing you in your own sweat up top.

[**The Prince Charlie**](http://www.stkildaretail.com.au/images/main/vpc_a.jpg)

The most formal of the popular options, the Prince Charlie Jacket is worn for evening and black tie events. It consists of a coatee with small tails at the back and a high rise at the front, accentuated by square metal buttons all over the place. It is combined traditionally with the 3-button waistcoat shown in the picture, and is only ever worn with the waistcoat.

[**The Argyll**](http://scotweb-objects.com/images/items1/sr_swhdr_classic_black_argyll_vest.jpg)

Slightly less formal, and more conventionally shaped, the Argyll is the most versatile of the choices presented. Similarly decorative to its more formal counterpart, it can be worn at both black tie events, and more informal day events, such as gatherings or weddings. The traditional waistcoat pairing is the 5-button waistcoat shown, though the Argyll can be worn without it just as well.

[**Day Jackets**](http://www.kinlochanderson.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/320x427/5e06319eda06f020e43594a9c230972d/t/h/the_kinloch_anderson_day_kilt_jacket_in_green_lovat_tweed_special_order_dj-gl-so.jpg)

The most casual of the trio, these are conventionally shaped and generally tweed. The are often more experimental with colours as well, coming in heather greens, light greens, and even dark greens! (blue is also acceptable but likely to receive odd looks from the gentry). These are generally seen on occasions such as gatherings, hunts etc. and would not be welcome at black-tie functions. Broadswords may come out (pun fully intended)
_____________________________________________________________
**Accessories**

Arguably, the accessories to kilt outfits are what truly make them, though they are small and numerous, so I will summarise them together, starting with the biggest and working down.

**Neckties**

Generally there are three options to hang round your neck when it comes to Highland attire. in descending order of formality, you have [bow-ties](https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQtuawfjYrhGGdecq0ncPoQbzbA8r1uSGFAqXJOKW1tYqAldl1P) (generally, though not strictly, black), [cravats](http://www.irishkilts.co.uk/images-2006/main-page/spirit-bannockburn.jpg) (normally matching or complementing your tartan, and always worn with a waistcoat), and [woollen or tweed ties](http://www.jmkilts.co.uk/pictures/pic44db32c47109e.jpg) (other materials are passable, but when so dashing in your woollen kilt, why not complete the set?) 

**Sporran**

The manliest form of bag possible, it is a pouch of glory, made of the hairs of whatever animal you have recently killed with your bare hands. It is chained loosely around the waist, and essentially rests on your junk. Some simple ones are [leather](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQso-rY4nfJo7CLhMsnMn-vS2ZQXNmWxQuzRbgpBalZks5yFjQo), whereas others can be [extremely ornate](http://www.edinburghbagpipes.co.uk/images/no%201%20sporran%20EBC.jpg), made of the hair of horses, hares and even badgers. Ornate ones tend to be reserved for special occasions, whereas leather ones are far more for utility (as seen in the photo of myself in a rather dashing football top).

**Socks**

Kilt wearers adorn what are known as kilt hose, which are long and thick woollen socks that come in a variety of colours. Traditionally, it is a [cream colour](http://www.sportswarehouse4u.com/ekmps/shops/sportswarehouse/images/kilt-socks-highlander-ecru-3155-p.jpg) that is worn with evening kilt outfits, though more modern iterations pull off [black socks](http://www.highlandstore.com/acatalog/kilt_packages_black_spirit.jpg) very well. Both compliment evening wear. They are always worn with flashes as well, seen in the photos above.

Other colours, such as charcoal, dark and light greens, and other earth colours tend to be reserved for day jacket outfits, and are almost always match the jacket itself. 

**Shoes**

Thought tying shoe laces was easy? Spare a thought for the 16-year old Scotsman tackling [ghillie brogues](http://images.sodahead.com/polls/000688573/polls_GhillieBrogues01_2251_484862_poll_xlarge.jpeg) for the first time. They are seen as the only option for evening wear kilt outfits, and are leather-soled with a metal insert in the heel for extra oomph on the dancefloor. As seen in the photo, the laces are tied half-way up the calf, and are twisted round numerous times. Just an extra little accent that really asserts the kilt as the king of accessories.

**Ornaments**

There are a number of other authentic accessories which really set the kilt apart from other formal-wear. Items such as **kilt pins** are one such example, which act as a broach for the kilt itself. Traditionally silver, they often depict [weaponry](http://www.your-kilt.com/images/kiltpin1.jpg), or [animal feet](https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSKR1pVfZ5YTyenNF0duxEw4-648ptdhcRm-BQ7q5Nq32jh_CaB).

The final and perhaps most interesting piece of the puzzle is the **Sgian Dubh** (said ski-en doo). It is a [small dagger](http://www.knivesbynick.co.uk/images/hi/knives/historical/buff_sgian_dubh.jpg) placed in the [top of the sock](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/47/Sgian_Dubh.jpg/220px-Sgian_Dubh.jpg). Originally out of manners when attending other clan feasts (it was polite to carry your own knife for dining), it now serves to assert the badass image of burly Scotsmen. They can be ornate, with blades made of Damascus steel, and handles made of stag horn, but many simply carry the family crest.

**Underwear**

Nope. You should all know that this really goes without saying...

While I’m sure this is not something that will seriously influence the style of anyone on MFA, there is a rich culture to the aesthetic of metal and it is often overlooked or ignored. While metalheads like to claim that they are above fashion and style, there is a distinct look throughout metal as a whole and its subgenres. This is my attempt to document, explain and discuss this distinct style. Not everything I say is a hard and fast “rule” as different styles cross pollinate and bands attempt to subvert norms, but I think this a strong start at documenting and explaining this oft ignored style. 

While /r/malefashionadvice and /r/metal seem like odd bedfellows, I felt that I was in a unique position to do a sort of sociological and stylistic study on my favorite type of music. This is not meant to be a guide to ""dressing metal"" or being a metal head, it is meant to be a rough overview and history of a much maligned and almost completely ignored style. 


*Also, I'd suggest turning off RES (and using Hoverzoom) to read this post.*

______________________________________________________________________________________________

**Background**

The basis for style within the metal community comes from a number of influences and artists. While Black Sabbath laid down the foundation for the music, Their [early visual style has not had the same long lasting influence.](http://i.imgur.com/e50Yy) it was not until bands like Judas Priest, Motörhead and Mercyful Fate came around that was saw the skeleton of metal’s overall style start to form. 

[Leather obsessed Rob Halford brought the first long lasting style](http://i.imgur.com/LVldA)  into the mainstream metal world with his over the top all-leather outfits adapted from the gay leather scene of London and elsewhere in the 70s. The biker machismo of leather took the forefront over the homosexual aspect but the metal world has been hellbent on the material ever since. 

[Motörhead](http://i.imgur.com/DoUIX) helped bridge the gap between punk and metal which brought about a melting pot of fashion and style into both communities. Punk was a changing but still fully developed style and metal’s fledgling status meant it would adopt much of the scene’s style. Through punk influence, metal would adopt the [bullet belt](http://i.imgur.com/S9kcC.jpg), the [battle jacket or kutte](http://i.imgur.com/1C4ss.jpg), [spikes and studs.](http://i.imgur.com/p2DVr.jpg) While Motörhead’s western look never took off, they opened doors both musically and stylistically. 

Finally you have [King Diamond’s push for theatrics and visual showmanship.](http://i.imgur.com/0BfXS.jpg) Alice Cooper may have already been cutting his head off, but Mercyful Fate’s King Diamond was in the ears of every metalhead across the globe. The theatrics and vaudevillian stage presence of the King influenced stage presence, make up and the overall tone of metal in a way that has had reaching effects on every genre in the scene. Even when the vast majority of bands ditched the theatrics, [many bands still utilize](http://i.imgur.com/nkO7X.jpg) [powerful imagery](http://i.imgur.com/PENeL.jpg) [in their live performances.](http://i.imgur.com/VySOM.jpg)


[**Battle Jacket**](http://i.imgur.com/1C4ss.jpg)

The battle jacket, typically denim or [leather vest](http://i.imgur.com/ZJJWA.jpg) , is as important to metal as the college tie is to prep. It is not only a stylistic choice, but tells a story to those in your social scene. As a tie in your college colors tells the world of your affiliation and background, the battle jacket is designed to show where your devotion lies. The battle jacket, another adoption from the [punk/hardcore scene](http://i.imgur.com/aPxaK.jpg), essentially allows you to wear multiple band shirts at once and shows your devotion to your favorite bands. Patches are a way to support a band, and to learn about new bands from fellow metalheads. Not only are the patches meant to bring fans together, but they also allowed bands to advertise in the pre-internet era.  The ultimate sign of devotion to a band is to give them the coveted [back patch in the back center of your jacket.](http://i.imgur.com/WclZv.jpg) These oversized patches scream to the masses that you hold no other bands above said band (or they have a really sick back patch). 

Battle jackets remain most popular among thrash fans but [black metal fans](http://i.imgur.com/WKBGh.jpg) are also big supporters of this aspect of the heavy metal uniform. Typically, but not always, thrashers wear denim vests and black metal fans wear black leather. 

**Boots**

Boots are the only thing besides a black band tee that cross all genre boundaries and have never faded out of style. The purpose and popularity of boots are 3-fold. Boots can take a beating which makes them popular among touring bands with very little cash (and when bands start to do something, the fans will follow). Boots protect your feet when you’re caught in a mosh and more focused on protecting your face and less concerned about your feet. Boots also play into the military style that metal has latched onto and never let go. 

**Pants**
Jeans are the predominate pants in the metal community. Black is obviously universally regarded as the go-to color but a pair of light wash blue denim is fairly popular amongst thrashers. Jeans are on the skinnier side but have loosened up a bit after the popularity of “skinny” jeans amongst post-hardcore and metalcore fans. Metalheads rarely wear [crust pants.](http://i.imgur.com/wG85c.jpg) 

While jeans are the most popular, army surplus store camo fatigues and camo shorts are also a part of the style of metal. Shorts are the most popular option for camo but it’s really a personal choice. 

Some people, mostly performing artists, wear leather pants or spandex. Members of Iron Maiden still wear spandex despite my letters. 

**Genre Specific Clothing**

&gt;Thrash

It would appear that I am focusing most of my efforts into the thrash metal genre but if we’re talking about metal style, this is the most recognizable. I’ve always assumed that Thrash had such a set style because of its punk roots and the desire to separate themselves from the Glam rock of the time. Growing up in the shadow of Motley Crue and Poison pushed thrash to adopt a very distinct and recognizable style that has stayed popular even as the genre waxes and wanes throughout time.

*Nike High Tops*

Looking back on pictures of 80s thrash bands you find a surprising amount of [high-tops](http://i.imgur.com/GdHww.jpg) for a genre so fond of military imagery and accessories. The shoes, already popular in the mainstream, found their home and popularity in thrash, thanks in part, to record labels. Dave Mustaine said that when he signed his record deal with Capitol (or Combat, I can’t remember) the band was given next to no money, but they did get [white Nike High Tops.](http://i.imgur.com/CQISL.jpg) As one of the most influential bands in thrash, you can bet the [rest of the metal world would follow in their footsteps.](http://i.imgur.com/XUyS8.jpg)

[*Bullet Belt*](http://i.imgur.com/M303f.jpg)

The bullet belt is the most obvious influence of military style in the metal community. Beloved across genres and styles, the bullet belt is still most popular among thrashers but it is not unheard of to see it in DM or BM scenes. [The bullet belt](http://i.imgur.com/pE1po.jpg) is another adoption from punk and is completely aesthetic… it obviously does not actually work as a real belt. Bullet belts can get expensive, running up to $50 or $60 for real metal, which is an absolute must, but army surplus stores often stock them because they are a sought after item. 

&gt;Death Metal

The death metal community may be the least style heavy genre in the extreme metal community. Straight-forward and raw, DM cut metal down to the bone and flair went out with it. Death metal’s biggest contributions to metal’s overall style was the popularization of [long sleeve shirts NSFW](http://i.imgur.com/svb5c.jpg) and hoodies. The basis for this might be that a long sleeve shirt or a hoodie might be the only thing you need to get through those mild Florida winters but the extra space for art also played into the graphic heavy death metal imagery. Extreme hair length is also most popular among death metal fans, more so than any other genre, and battle jackets [exist](http://i.imgur.com/i2btw.jpg) but not to the level of thrash or BM. 

&gt;Black Metal

Stylistically 2nd Wave Black Metal musicians take the cake when it comes to aesthetics. Visually influenced by Mercyful Fate and Venom, Black Metal was forged in the theatrics of classic shock rock and with the leather and attitude of extreme metal. Black metal ditched the military aesthetics of thrash in favor of the [impersonal](http://wcrxmetalshow.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/watain-erik1.jpg) and [inhuman.](http://i.imgur.com/26Oah.jpg) . 


Visually, the performers of the music tend to focus on [corpse paint](http://i.imgur.com/mn9fO.jpg) with early bands using Kiss and King Diamond [inspired style](http://i.imgur.com/tbrHp.jpg) and later bands pushing into more [stylized designs.](http://www.ratemycorpsepaint.com/test/q1.jpg) 
Another aspect of the black metal style for performers is dangerous accessories in the form of [weapons](http://www.thegauntlet.com/pics/Immortal%20-%20Band.jpg) and [spiked leather gauntlets.](http://i.imgur.com/p2DVr.jpg)  Nothing screams inaccessible and dangerous quite like a man with an axe or with 7 inch spikes coming out of their arms.   

Unlike other genres of metal, black metal fans and black metal performers have a big disconnect in styles of dress. Live black metal is focused heavily on theatrics and going to the grocery store looking like Abbath makes you look like [these guys.](http://wagonwhale.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/black-metal-suburbia.jpg) Fans typically show their kvlt status through black metal shirts, black pants and black boots. Black Metal fans are more likely than other metalheads to wear some kind of spiked or studded accessory.

naturally, i could assume there's no good reason and it's branding/hype/whatever else.  but!!!  it also seems like a lot of people who know quite a lot more than me about the subject seem to think it's actually quite reasonable.  so i was hoping that crowd would see this and weigh in.

i understand why *some* things cost a lot of money.  bespoke suits, shoes, certain denim, leather, etc.  but sometimes there'll be things like $200 t-shirts and people say ""that's ridiculous"" and someone else says ""no it's the way it drapes"" or something and never really elaborates on what this means or why it's so costly to achieve.  so i'm curious, when it comes to seemingly-simple fashion-forwardish items like that, or like other things where the input costs aren't self-evident, what besides branding/desirability drives cost up to the extent that it does?

**edit**: i've gotten about fifty ""because that's what people are willing to pay for them duh"" answers, and i would point out that i more or less explicitly stated that this was the default explanation and thus did not need to be offered, and that the purpose of this post was to generate responses from the fashion-oriented members of this sub who actively say that this is not necessarily the whole story and that people who say ""no way $250 for a t-shirt is reasonable"" don't understand all the nuance going into the product that makes it exceptional when compared to normal t-shirts.",,False,self,t5_2r65t,1368250325.0,,,True,t3_1e25y8,http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/1e25y8/hey_why_are_expensive_clothes_so_expensive/,

Candidly, we go after the cool kids. We go after the attractive all-American kid with a great attitude and a lot of friends. A lot of people don’t belong, and they can’t belong. Are we exclusionary? Absolutely. Those companies that are in trouble are trying to target everybody: young, old, fat, skinny. But then you become totally vanilla. You don’t alienate anybody, but you don’t excite anybody, either,”

I think the whole ""no fat chicks"" thing makes a lot of sense given their target market (douchebags). 

We talk a bit about brands on MFA and what they mean, and this article is a good example of what values brands can represent. Unlike some companies (UNIQLO is a good example, with their 'Made For All' slogan) A&amp;F seems to further create divides between us as people, and that's not something I can get behind.

There aren't any images in the [Japanese streetwear sidebar thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/17bkew/japanese_streetwear_a_basis/) (which I recommend reading, because it gives good background on fashion in Japan), so I figured this would be an album I would enjoy putting together. 

I think this album gives a good representation of street fashion in Japan, specifically Harajuku, Shibuya, and Shinjuku in Tokyo. These are the areas where the most interesting and diverse trends stem from. There are many different styles in Japan and I tried to capture a good mix of them in this album - both male and female, although the album's emphasis is on men because this is, of course, *male*fashionadvice. 

Personally, I really love Japanese fashion. It is so creative and intriguing - I feel like there is no limit to what can be done with it. My favorite aspects of fashion in Japan are the silhouettes created by some of the outfits, playing with colors and patterns in ways that would be unimaginable in the West, and in some cases, the shear simplicity of an outfit.

If there is any interest in a specific Japanese style, I would be more than happy to try and put together an album of that one in particular. 

Also, if anybody is interested, **[here](http://imgur.com/a/syG3X)** is a small album of some pictures I took while in Japan.

I hope these images find some of you well! I would be interested in hearing what you do / don't like about Japanese street fashion.

1369168678.0,670,self.malefashionadvice,1escts,Guide to Summer Beach Club Attire,866,196,222,http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/1escts/guide_to_summer_beach_club_attire/,"I had great time writing [my last guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/1dr04d/springsummer_guide_to_nightclub_wear/), so I figured I would give this another shot.

Memorial Day is coming upon us in the US, that means it's time to go outside and enjoy the sun for a few months.  I named the guide ""Beach Club Attire"", but this is applicable pretty much anytime that you're out in the sun enjoying the day with friends.  Whether you are [on a boat](http://i.imgur.com/veU7idy.jpg), [a beer garden](http://i.imgur.com/AvsFyOj.jpg), [your favorite brunch spot](http://i.imgur.com/wDqm1O1.jpg) or whatever else is the place the be; you're outside, getting some drinks and enjoying the beautiful weather.

To preface, I want to point out what I believe are the two most important parts to dressing for this scenario, fit and color cohesion.

As you all know by now, fit is always important.  However, as opposed to my last guide where minor details in fit can be overlooked because of dim lighting in a crowded space, you're going to be in the opposite scenario now.  You will have plenty of space and lighting, everything you wear will be visible.  As a result, its important to try and find what clothes are right for you.

As I just said, there will be lots of light since you're out in the sun.  The colors that you're wearing will really pop in the sun.  Color and pattern selection is very important as you want everything to work together.  Ideally, you want one piece to stand out whether it be your pants, shirt or shoes.  If you mix too many bold patterns and colors, you're going to give off the [classic fratty vibe](http://i.imgur.com/0uah7rH.jpg).  If that's your thing, go for it, but if not keep one item bold and the other subtle (white, light grey, khaki).  I'd also avoid black and earth tones, it's a time to celebrate the sun, don't be afraid to go bold with your colors and patterns.

Ok, lets get detailed here.

**Shirt:**

You have options here.  [T-Shirts](http://redd.it/d08wh), [Polos](http://redd.it/17i88u), and shirts.  Before I expand, it is worth reading those guides if you have not.  Both guides are very well written and explain a lot when it comes to fit. 

When choosing your shirt, you must first decide if this piece is going to be the center piece of your outfit.  A floral [shirt](http://i.imgur.com/WQhiut4.jpg) or [T-shirt](http://i.imgur.com/nTVKERO.jpg) will certainly be a focal point you will base things off of.  On the other hand a subtley colored [OCBD](http://i.imgur.com/HXz5dkt.jpg) or [polo](http://www.kentwang.com/polos/polo-white.html) will give you the room to go bold on your pants or maybe shoes.

Don't be afraid to try out something new here.  The event is going to be very casual, so as long as that floral or linen shirt fits you well, you're good to go.

As an aside, I want to talk about fit of button downs here.  Besides for having them well fitting across the chest and waist, length is something to keep note of.  I would err on the side of too short here if you're wearing it untucked.  Granted I'm 6'4"" so maybe thats just what happens with all my shirts, but when I dressing for this scenario with a button down, I like to the shirt to land at the same place a tshirt would.  Just below the belt in the front and slightly higher in the sides.  Just long enough so that you're able to bend and sit down without the shirt coming above your belt line.

Sleeve rolling is the best way to mask all those missed gym days.  It should go without saying for long sleeve shirts, but short sleeve shirts can have their sleeves rolled also.  If you [don't quite fill out your short sleeve button down](http://i.imgur.com/4mL7rqg.jpg) roll the sleeves a little and it should help you [fill those sleeves out.](http://i.imgur.com/h24DC4E.jpg)

If you're going with a t-shirt it's important to choose the style that fits you best.  Personally, I'm a big fan of [AA V-necks](http://store.americanapparel.net/product/?productId=2456), the fit and quality are very good and I get to let me chest hair glisten.  [Swoop Neck T's](http://us.asos.com/Men-T-Shirts-Tanks-Scoop-Neck-T-Shirts/zcd8v/?cid=16852&amp;r=2) are also a decent option.  In my opinion, these work better on smaller guys whereas V-necks are better for bigger guys.  Crew neck are nice middle ground, I'd suggest something similar to [Ball &amp; Buck](http://ballandbuck.com/collections/ball-and-buck-t-shirts/products/ball-and-buck-original-pocket-tee) so you don't look like you're wearing an undershirt out there.  Outlier also makes great t's if you can afford to go for it.


**Pants:**

OK, you have two options here.  [Shorts](http://redd.it/1968m0) or chinos (Read the shorts guide if you haven't yet).

I'm a big fan of shorts in these scenarios.  They're slightly cheaper and there's more room for error in terms of fit.  In my opinion, the best shorts are in a 7"" inseam.  Not too short, not too long.  This is somewhat subjective though, if you're going to be uncomfortable in a 7"", go with a 8-10"" short.  It's better to be confident in what you're wearing.  If you want to go with a 5"" and have the legs for it, by all means do it.  Personally, I'm a big fan of [Bonobos](http://www.bonobos.com/stone-cotton-shorts-for-men-b-s-knees) and [J.Crew](http://www.jcrew.com/mens_category/shorts/stantonshorts/PRDOVR~75488/75488.jsp) for shorts.  They both make them in a variety of colors and sizes for about $65 a pair.  As an aside, I do have a pair of Lacoste shorts, I'd avoid as they're more money and I'm not a fan of the branding.  Quality and fit wise, they're pretty good though.

The other option is chinos.  These are going to be tougher than shorts as a poor fit is going to be much more apparent than it would be with shorts.  The first step here is to find the pair that fits you the best.  Luckily, you have a huge selection at your disposal from J.Crew and Bonobos to [Gant](http://us.gant.com/men/clothing/pants/r-summer-chino) and [Uniqlo.](http://www.uniqlo.com/us/store/lifewear/men-slim-fit-chino-flat-front-pants/075305-12-036?ref=mens-clothing%2Fmens-bottoms%2Fmens-pants)  Besides for the normal sizing issues you look for with pants it is important to note inseam.  Typically I wear a 34x34, however with chinos I've started wearing a 34x32.  It's nice to have no break and err on the shorter side of things.  If you're between sizes or something, size up and you can always tailor the pants.  The key is to keep the leg opening on the slim but not skinny side and to not have the pants break against your shoes.  

You can also cuff the pants, but that horse has been beaten to death on MFA.  Debate that somewhere else.

In terms of color when choosing pants or shorts, this is dependent on what shirt you have chosen.  If you decided to let your shirt dominate keep the pants subtle.  If you decided to keep the top subtle, don't be afraid to [get a little crazy with color](http://www.bonobos.com/red-slim-spring-weight-italian-chinos-for-men-red) [(Blue also works](http://www.bonobos.com/bright-blue-slim-oxford-pants-for-men-oxleys) if you're not ready for red yet.

**Intermission:**

OK, so hopefully you just had some fun reading that and doing a little online shopping at the same time.  That's good because you're shopping for a fun occasion, I can't think of anything better than day drinking in the sun with friends.

**Shoes**

BOAT SHOES ARE AWESOMEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!1!!!11!!!!!!!

But in all honestly, boat shoes are ok.  Everyone knows you can get a pair of [Sperry's](http://www.sperrytopsider.com/store/SiteController/sperry/productdetails?catId=cat90046DM&amp;subCatId=cat100066DM&amp;showDefaultOption=true&amp;stockNumber=0195115&amp;skuId=***7********0195115*W160&amp;productId=7-100210&amp;&amp;subCatId=cat100066DM&amp;productId=7-100210&amp;stockNumber=0195115&amp;subCatTabId=&amp;catId=cat90046DM&amp;productdisplayName=Men's+Authentic+Original+Boat+Shoe&amp;subcatdisplayName=Boat+Shoes&amp;skuId=***7********0195115*W160&amp;pageIdentifier=productdetail&amp;catdisplayName=Men&amp;showDefaultOption=true) for a decent price and the quality will be fine.  [I'd get some Rancourt's with Horween](http://www.rancourtandcompany.com/men-s-1/boat-shoes/read-boat-shoe-tan-burnished-cowhide.html) leather.  Sure, they're a little more money but the leather will be so soft and nice.

OK now that I put out the boat shoe shoutout, fuck boat shoes.  You're so much better than boat shoes.  I use my boat shoes at the beach because I think sandals can kiss my ass.  Fuck sandals, they hurt and make weird noises when I walk. 

Don't be afraid to drop a little money on some shoes here.  You're going somewhere nice, I'm hoping you won't be getting spilt or stepped on.  You also might be doing some standing depending on your venue, it'll be nice to have a little comfort.  Personally, I'm going to be going around in a pair of [Oakstreet Bootmakers Crepe Sole Penny's](http://i.imgur.com/99Xppd6.jpg) this summer.  Besides OSB [Rancourt](http://www.rancourtandcompany.com/men-s-1/penny-loafers.html) makes a nice Made In USA penny loafer.  One of my buddies always wears [these Cole Haan](http://www.zappos.com/cole-haan-howland-penny-saddle-tan?zfcTest=fcl%3A2) driving sole penny loafers and seems to like them a lot.  The driving sole is nice as it will give you a very low profile.

If you're keeping your pants a subtle white, khaki or grey color don't be afraid to try out a pair of [blue shoes](http://i.imgur.com/2VKUDTf.jpg).  Brown is going to be easier, but blue leather or suede are very nice sometimes.  [JDbee](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/qh6jh/a_trend_we_should_all_get_behind_navy_shoes_with/) wrote about navy shows with red brick soles at some point, his guide is worth reading as that might be something that you are into.

[Buck's](http://i.imgur.com/2jqpjOr.jpg) might also be the style of shoe for you.  They're going to stand out slightly more than the penny loafer, but if you go with a [tan](http://shop.nordstrom.com/s/1901-logan-oxford/3227550?origin=category-personalizedsort&amp;contextualcategoryid=0&amp;fashionColor=&amp;resultback=356&amp;cm_sp=personalizedsort-_-browseresults-_-1_2_C) it could pair up nicely without being too loud.

You can also wear sneakers.  You know the drill here.  [Converses, Van's, CP's...](http://i.imgur.com/mEhp3ME.jpg) whatever makes you happy here.  Keep the sneakers simple without much branding and pair the color up right.  By pairing the color right, I mean if you're wearing blue chinos, maybe wear a white sneaker.  If you're wearing a pair of khaki chinos, now's the time to try out those [floral shoes](http://i.imgur.com/chtvazj.jpg) you've had sitting around.  

However, nows the time to point out that if you're shoes are floral they are now your focal point.  Don't wear a shirt equally loud.  Don't be afraid to put a little color up top, but nothing too crazy.  Maybe a simple sky blue polo.  Alternate your colors, if you're shoes are colored wear colorless pants and a colored shirt.  Or colored pants with a colorless shirt and shoes.  This is how to further avoid that ""frat bro""/clown look.

**Accessories:**

Watches are a nice thing to wear at this time.  Put your phone in your pocket and keep it there, nobody's calling you. Don't be afraid to try out something fun here.  [Nato strap's](http://i.imgur.com/X5enVu3.jpg) can set a nice look in this scenario.  I'm also a big fan of [dive watches](http://i.imgur.com/L6wh5ME.jpg) for casual settings.  They're tasteful yet at the same time give off a casual vibe.  I wouldn't say [dress watches](http://i.imgur.com/mGJhRaZ.jpg) are impossible, but with shorts and a t-shirt they look a little off. Keep it casual.  As /u/elvis_jagger pointed out in the comments, the Tissot Visodate is perfectly capable of being worn in a casual manner as it's not a true dress watch.  If you can fit something similar into your wardrobe, go for it.  It's a beautiful watch.

Hats.  Unless you're at a ballgame, you're always better showing off your hair than a hat.  Not going to lie though, you can probably catch me on a Friday after work with a hat on.  I wear a hard hat all day at work so if I go out straight from work my options are limited.  If you're in a similar case, do what you got to do.  A hat looks better than having your hair all disheveled looking.

Bracelets are good if that's your thing.  I personally don't wear one but I've considered it.  [Tanner](http://www.tannergoods.com/products/double-wristband-saddle-tan-brass) and [KJP](https://kieljamespatrick.com/) both make some pretty cool bracelets.

Sunglasses.  Should you have sunglasses, probably.  They're good looking and protect your eyes from the sun.  Which brand is entirely up to you.  [Some people hate Luxxotita](http://sunglasshutsucks.blogspot.com/) but Sunglass Hut gives a phenomenal return policy.  You can return no questions asked within 90 days for a full refund or I think exchange within a year.  No bad if you get buyers remorse.  [Warby Parker](http://www.warbyparker.com/) is also decent for the money, nothing amazing.  It's difficult to give sunglass advice because everyones face is so different.  The key point is to avoid anything sporty looking, you wouldn't wear running shoes so why would you wear running sunglasses.  Furthermore, when selecting sunglasses it's important buy ones that allow your eye brows to be visible. 

[Neutrogena](http://www.neutrogena.com/product/ultra+sheer+body+mist+sunscreen+broad+spectrum+spf+30.do?sortby=ourPicks) makes the best sunblock ever, get some if you need it.

If there's something I missed, let me know, I'll update it.

[Emberglo](http://www.reddit.com/user/Emberglo) [asked for an update]( http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/15s6oc/can_somebody_make_a_guide_about_colors/) to the [current color theory guide]( http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/ginj6/in_which_epicviking_teaches_you_how_to_match/), so here it is. This one has pictures. Lots and lots of pictures.

As with the last guide, I’m a very, very avid supporter of grouping color by season. But before we get to all that noise - 

###Color Theory 101  
----
&gt; 

##Hue, Saturation, Lightness

Colors have 3 basic attributes that we’ll use to describe them:

1. Hue – When people talk about “colors”, this is what they mean.

2. Saturation – The intensity of a color. Highly saturated colors are full/rich/vivid. As a color loses saturation, it looks increasingly “washed out” and grey.

3. Lightness/Value – The brightness or darkness of a color.

[This photoshop tool sums it up nicely](http://imgur.com/w0yQz)

##Contrast
Contrast is the perceived difference between two different colors.

You can have contrast of value – black and white are opposites, and the contrast between them will be stark. Blue and yellow are opposite one another on the color wheel, and the difference between them will be similarly extreme.

Colors that are more similar have less contrast. If the hue/saturation of two colors is similar, they will appear to blend together rather than stand out (like neighbors on the color wheel). The same is true of values that are near to each other. 

[Here’s a diagram demonstrating this.](http://imgur.com/v4fcH)

There’s a LOT more to be said about color theory, if you’d like to google it. Our brains perceive color in some crazy ways, [some of which will deeply fuck your mind]( http://www.psy.ritsumei.ac.jp/~akitaoka/color-e.html).

A piece of advice I see here all the time: “Just use the color wheel”. [The color wheel](http://imgur.com/Tl9tb) is awesome, but it’s a really literal, scientific tool. Choosing colors (and textures) that look good together is far less scientific. It’s very subjective, and the color wheel is not a very useful tool on its own.

Instead, I made this gigantic chart of colors, broken down by season, with accompanying looks.     
  
----------  
  
&gt;  

###[The giant seasonal menswear color spectrum diagram thing 1.0](http://imgur.com/hiJfB)

--------

Now, let’s break those groups down, in order of appearance on the chart.

###Bright Colors:

- [Blues](http://imgur.com/vC1E9) and [reds](http://imgur.com/efOFT) of any lightness

- [Bright yellow](http://imgur.com/awTyS) and orange

- Medium – light [green](http://imgur.com/irib9), [pink](http://imgur.com/ihOjk), and [purple](http://imgur.com/zLE95)

- [Teals/robin’s egg blue](http://imgur.com/AlcDr)

- [Cream](http://imgur.com/MoJhW) or [Khaki](http://imgur.com/Woh1k)

- The [brightest white](http://imgur.com/InjDd) you can get your hands on

- [Lighter](http://imgur.com/esfhq), richer [honey colored leathers](http://imgur.com/Nmm1c).

These colors are more saturated (intense). Just about any color can be amped up to fit in this category. Ever seen [the shirt shelves at Express](http://imgur.com/smFBZ)? This shit is their bread and butter.

Be very careful with these. They’re the opposite of pastels. The intensity of these colors needs to be smartly balanced or risk being way too “in your face”. When you’ve got a loud piece of clothing, anchor it by making the other pieces more subdued([one](http://imgur.com/uQfuE)[two](http://imgur.com/RG6yx)). In both of those examples, there's a really colorful piece, but it's held down by the fact that the vast majority of the outfit is very plainly colored. If you don't balance your crazy colors, you run the risk of looking like [this douche](http://imgur.com/Jf9UU).

##In spring:

Tone down with whites, cream/khaki, pastels, and light –medium greys and browns. Use unpatterned things as inner layers, and in small areas. I’m really partial to white polkdots, or colored dots on white, but it’s a somewhat feminine look and pretty hard to find items like that. Medium width stripes, especially in pink, green, and medium blue are easier to find and pull off, usually on shirts.

##In summer:

Contrast pieces. Pick an article of clothing and make it loud as all hell. Go for big, bold patterns. [Thick colored stripes on white backgrounds](http://imgur.com/D6icf), large geometric patterns, shirts made of a few big solid blocks of color, etc. 

Building entire outfits out of really, really loud colors is hard, but it’s going to be very trendy this year. It was HUGE in women’s style last summer, and carried over pretty strongly into fall, especially jcrew’s women’s line. Insanely bright pants, shorts, and casual shoes are going to be par for the course in summer. If you want to really stand out, get a bright blazer or a buck/derby shoe in something nuts([one](http://imgur.com/xzpMO)[two](http://imgur.com/uxoz7)). I suggest a [melon-ish red](http://imgur.com/iwvUF)/pink or a very saturated blue. It’s trendy for yellows to err slightly on the side of green. Pair any of these with white and a little bit of honey brown and you’re solid. 

##In fall: 

Balance these out with a lot of earth tones. Keep them buried and just let them peek out. The exception to this is vests. You can get away with some [pretty intense vests](http://imgur.com/RjLcA) in the fall, as long as you anchor it with everything else.

##In winter: 

White is definitely the easiest to pull off in winter. Use it generously. Keep the teal, pink, etc in the closet. If you’ve gotta go bright,  do so [with accessories](http://imgur.com/QH02y), and go for the really saturated medium tones –without going all the way neon. Red, not pink. Dandelion yellow, not that greenish one that everybody loves in summer. The fall rule about burying them and just letting a hint peek out applies doubly.  If you’re gonna work a crazy bright piece into a winter outfit, I suggest [scarves](http://imgur.com/nYCeA) or shoes/laces. Bright socks are a little played out/tryhard IMO, but there are a lot of people who would disagree, so make your own call.  

   
###Pastels: 
  
&gt;  


These colors are lighter and desaturated (pale). 

- [Light Blue](http://imgur.com/BOss5)

- [Light Pink](http://imgur.com/Hersc)

- [Light Green](http://imgur.com/EjHPR)

- [Light Grey](http://imgur.com/J3Gys)

- [Light Khaki](http://imgur.com/GF4NN)

Any color can be brightened into a pastel. Because they’re so calm, it’s very easy to incorporate them into outfits without being overpowering. That’s part of what makes them such a safe choice, and such a staple in “the uniform” and business casual in general.

##In spring:

Pair with other pastels for outfits that are [appropriately light](http://imgur.com/fnxhG) without being [as in-your-face as summer](http://imgur.com/A0K3l). Work in medium browns and blues for contrast.  Keep your pastels solid. Patterns can be any size/density. Minimal contrast will feel cooler/lighter, higher contrast will feel more like summer. Lighter fabrics here. Linen, silk, seersucker, etc.

##In summer: 

Aim for high contrast in either direction. Pair with bright whites or very light khakis and the pastels will look more like midtones. Add a dark belt and shoes to make sure you don’t look too washed out. [Example](http://imgur.com/kxUkN) If you have patterns, make them very fine or very bold. Patterns should gravitate to either end of the spectrum: either very fine with low contrast, or very big with high contrast.

##In fall:

Texture is key. Thicken all the things! [Chambray](http://imgur.com/LmqIk) or heather fabrics are great. Go slightly darker where possible, but keep the paleness. Contrast buttons/stitching are awesome.  Keep pastels as a base layer, and bury them in richer, more autumny stuff. Blue and orangered are the best pastels for fall IMO. Keep your greens more towards olive, and your pinks more towards cherry. For [high contrast](http://imgur.com/0d4fg), pair with deep, dark browns, navy, and charcoal. In [more monotone looks](http://imgur.com/LuR2Z), pair with like colors or directly contrasting colors in muted tones. 

##In winter:

[Bury them even further](http://imgur.com/Zwoek) than in fall. Layer under sweaters and coats, just let the collars and cuffs stick out. With the exception of whites, blues, and khakis, pastels will probably not be a big part of your winter getup. If you have to have a patterned pastel in winter, steer away from stripes and more towards dots/speckles, gingham, or tartan.

1357182205.0,642,self.malefashionadvice,15v5ya,Hiroki's MFA Guide to Sweatshirts,853,211,200,http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/15v5ya/hirokis_mfa_guide_to_sweatshirts/,"Sweatshirts are just about as American as apple pie, baseball or obesity. One of the original American clothing inventions, sweatshirts have been worn and torn by Americans for years. Russell Athletic Co. invented the sweatshirt back in 1920, when Ben Russell Jr., who played football for Alabama (Roll Tide!), complained to his father about the uncomfortable wool jerseys they were forced to wear during practice. His suggestion was a soft cotton jersey, which would eventually become the sweatshirt that we know today. 

**Sweatshirt fit**

A sweatshirt should fit one of two ways: tight and hugging the body or loose and boxy. Vintage sweatshirts (or repro sweats) will generally fit boxy and short in the body (though some are slim) and narrow in the arms, as a point of reference. [Sweatshirt fit inspo album](http://imgur.com/a/bXyve), as requested.

**Fabric/Construction**

*French terry*: also known as loop terry, french loop terry, loop back cotton and several other marketing bullshit terms. French terry is woven like the terrycloth fabric used in towels, creating loops with the fabric and allowing it to absorb large amount of water or, in the case of sweatshirts, perspiration. It can be 100% cotton or a cotton-poly blend. Unlike terrycloth towels, however, French terry is woven in such a way as to have the absorbent looped fabric on only side, with the other side being flat.

*Cotton fleece*: fleece, not the synthetic kind but the kind made with cotton, is really just a wide-range of soft brushed cotton fabrics. Very comfortable and usually warm with a fuzzy, soft pile.

*The purpose of that V thingie*: that V *thingie*, is, for most purposes, a vestigial part of sweatshirt construction left over from the 1940s. The double V gusset that we’d find on both the front and the back of the neck in sweatshirts from the 1930s and 1940s was used for two purposes: one, to limit and control the stretch of the collar; and two, to absorb sweat (sweatshirts were, after all, athletic wear first and foremost). By the 1950s tho, it had become just a an extra layer of ribbed cotton stiched onto the collar. By the 1960s it was just two intersecting for decoration and eventually it was phased out all together until quite recently.

*Tubular knit construction*: also known as tube body construction, it is when a garment (usually a t-shirt or a sweatshirt) is made of a single piece of seamless fabric without side seams. The fabric is knitted around a tube and comes out as one tubular shape, hence “tubular knit” or “tube body” construction. This style of production was phased out some years ago (except for socks) because knitting different sizes requires the use of different tube looms, an increased expense. Tube body construction is still used for socks because socks are generally only made in one-size-fits-all or 2 sizes.

*Loopwheeled cotton*: there are some huge misconceptions about loopwheeled cotton and a whole lot of marketing bullshit from companies that misrepresent their products as loopwheeled when in reality they’re simply tubular knit or maybe not even that. [This](http://i.imgur.com/HZYmF.jpg) is what a loopwheeling machine looks like. Pretty fucking cool, right? Confusion arises because all loopwheeling machines are tubular knit but not all tubular knit machines are loopwheeling. Loopwheeling machines have a couple qualities that set them apart:

* All loopwheeling machines, to my knowledge, are all vintage from the 1920s. They are all from this period. *All of them.*

* The cotton is fed into the machine via gravity, no pulling down, which allows for the lack of excess tension (and very soft hand) that loopwheeled fabric possesses.

* The fabric is knit extremely slowly. Like, absurdly massively inefficient slowly. Loopwheeling machines can only knit about 12 meters (about 40 feet) of fabric in a single day, which would only amount to about 8-9 sweatshirts.

* The fabric must be cut by hand.

**Brands:**

**~~Low-end~~ Plebe tier**

[Uniqlo](http://www.uniqlo.com/us/): Uniqlo sweatshirts are some of the better ones on the lower-end of the spectrum, made of comfortable french terry and the elliptical neck opening that is reminiscent of those found on higher-end Japanese repro sweats. Ribbed cotton V sewn onto the collar. Fit is slim in the body and arms but I’ve had some success sizing up for a boxier fit. Available at the [Uniqlo e-store](http://www.uniqlo.com/us/mens-clothing/mens-tops/mens-sweatshirts)

[Champion](http://www.championusa.com/): classic American sportswear brand, Champion used to make some of the best sweats in the game. Japanese vintage collectors go crazy for old Champion reverse-weave sweats, they’re really fucking good. Even though Champion sweats are nowhere near the level of quality that they used to be, they’re still pretty good. Fit is loose and relaxed, size down if you want something closer to the body. Available on the [Champion webstore](http://www.championusa.com/workout-clothes/men/sweats---jackets/sweatshirts).

[J Crew](http://www.jcrew.com/index.jsp): pretty nice,construction is relatively good. Fit is slim, but not as slim as Uniqlo. Their sweats have the V detail on the collar, but it’s simply flat overlock stitching. Available at [J Crew](http://www.jcrew.com/mens_category/polostees/fleece.jsp).

[American Giant](http://www.american-giant.com/): subject of a recent MFA post and one of the darlings of the blogosphere, their sweats are MIUSA of 12.4 oz cotton fleece, with ribbed-cotton V insert at the collar.

1368548093.0,638,self.malefashionadvice,1ebksl,D.I.Y. Guide - Tee sleeve accents,946,308,141,http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/1ebksl/diy_guide_tee_sleeve_accents/,"I'd wanted to add some personal touches to otherwise plain basics for quite some time but after scouring local material stores I could never find any patterns that appealed to me. Then it hit me...thrift stores. For some reason it didn't occur to me that shirts would substitute as fabric samples. It's good because there are obviously tons of options at thrift stores, the cost is cheap, you don't need a TON of fabric (doing accents, pockets etc.) and it's likely that your new creation will feature a ""one off"" pattern. 

I picked up this [white v neck from h&amp;m for $10 i think and this womans shirt from a thrift store for $3](http://i.imgur.com/pdxMSEI.jpg?1) so total cost was $13 plus time. Cheaper if you want to thrift the t shirt too. I just used the sleeves from the womans shirt to do my cuffs but you could quite as easily do this with a section from the torso etc, it just involves a little more work to stop the fraying edges.  

* [First pin the sleeves together so that they are flush](http://i.imgur.com/83NDIWn.jpg?1). Measure in 1.5 - 2"" (depending on how big you want the cuff) and mark it.

* If you're like me and don't have a serger or pinking sheers you're going to want to [add a zig zag stitch](http://i.imgur.com/WCUX770.jpg?1) in order to stop the material from fraying. Do it on the inside of the line so it will fall between where you cut and the rest of the cuff. 

* Now you can [cut the sleeve off](http://i.imgur.com/hK7rCCp.jpg?1) right next to your zig zag stitch. Try and get as close to the stitch as possible without cutting into the stitch itself. 

* [Laying the cuff next to the sleeve](http://i.imgur.com/IUgl9tq.jpg) you can see that they aren't quite the same length. I don't know about you guys but it took me a little while to wrap my head around this next part haha. The white v neck is cotton with some elastic in it to give it some stretch while the floral cuff is simple cotton and has almost no give. If the shirt you have chosen stretches to fit around your guns then this part may be a little tough. Because the cuff doesn't stretch, THE CUFF needs to be the circumference that is comfortable for your bicep. Rule of thumb, measure the thickest part of your bicep and add 2"" for a snug fit, 3"" for a more comfortable fit, then divide by 2. This is the width you want the cuff to be when laying flat. (ie. 15"" bicep + 3"" = 18""... / 2 = 9""). In my case however, the sleeves on the t shirt fit my arms without having to stretch, so I could simply pin the cuff to the shirt sleeve without stretching the fabric because that was the circumference I needed. 

* Cut the cuff in half so that you have [one long strip like so.](http://i.imgur.com/8rKyKsT.jpg?1) 

* Turn the t shirt inside out and [start to pin the cuff to the sleeve of the shirt](http://i.imgur.com/BXT9N7v.jpg?1). THIS PART IS CRUCIAL DON'T DO WHAT I DID INITIALLY BECAUSE YOU'LL PROBABLY GIVE UP AT THE AMOUNT OF TIME IT TAKES TO CORRECT, pin it the right way around. What I mean is most fabrics have two sides, an outside and an inside. The outside is often brighter and bolder, and if you want this side to show then you need to pin it so that it's facing you when you pin it to the shirt sleeve (remember your shirt is inside out at this point). If the cuff was wider than the sleeve of the shirt (like mine) you're going to have some overlap when you get to the end of pinning the cuff to the shirt. Do your best to try and get the overlap to occur closer to the arm pit. You're going to be sewing the ends together later and it'll look better if they're out of sight.  Like I mentioned previously, if the sleeves don't need to stretch to fit your arms, then simply pin the cuff to the sleeve making sure that the sleeve of the shirt does not stretch at all while you're pinning it. However, if the sleeves do stretch then you're probably going to be spending this time at the gym rather than sewing some damn cuffs haha. If you manage to find time between reps, you're going to have to stretch the sleeve, pin the cuff, stretch the sleeve, pin the cuff. Keep doing this until you've reached the desired circumference. 

* Once everything is pinned, all the creases are out, and everything is in line, [it's time to start sewing](http://i.imgur.com/C6NgKJp.jpg?1). Your first stitch around should be the longest setting you have, that way if you've messed it up it's easy to pick out and reset. Once you've done that and you're happy with the results, go back and stitch with the shortest length you have. This will give you the strongest seam possible. 

* Now there should be a section where the cuff overlaps itself. Because you're going to be turning up the cuff anyways, there isn't really any need for this step, but I thought I'd just finish it off. [A couple zig zag stitches will hold it in place and stop it from fraying.](http://i.imgur.com/ybNHk2c.jpg?1) No need to be pretty here because if you've done things right this should be under your arm pit anyways so for the most part out of sight. 

* Finally turn your shirt right side out, you should have two cuffs sticking out (dull side out) as if it were a shirt worn underneath your v neck. Once you put the shirt on, you just turn up the cuffs to expose the brighter side. 

* [ta daaaaa](http://i.imgur.com/WVEYhVz.jpg)

*So something tells me that most people dont like this. I understand this guide is not perfect but thank you for reading. I hope to see some more good stuff in the future. Better than this.*

&gt; **Preface**
 
- *What do you mean ""Ideal"", Gilbert?*
 
This is simply my take on today's *ideal* streetwear. You may not agree with many statements in this thread, however I advise you to take my advice to achieve an optimal, clean, and respectable streetwear look.
 
- *I want to do something that you don't recommend... is this okay?*
 
Yes. In fact, I don't want you to follow everything I say in this post. Streetwear is an ever-changing look that is changed with personal influence. So do something that you like when you dress.
 
- *Who are you to say you should write the streetwear guide instead of someone else?*
 
I've seen it said a couple times on MFA that I wear streetwear more often than other people, and that some people like it. So I thought I might contribute back to the MFA community. I in no way think I am the best-dressed guy on MFA at all. Nor do I think that I have streetwear ""perfected"".
 
This is just my take.

&gt; **Intro**
 
Streetwear is one of the most ever-changing styles in today's world. Over the last decade, Streetwear has been changed with numerous influenced from many other styles.
 
Keep in mind that Streetwear is an extremely versatile style that can be used for many different looks.

This is just to get you thinking, but look through the guide to see *why* I chose some of these pics.

&gt; **The Mentality**
 
There is a brutal, honest truth that everyone should know about streetwear. It’s very exclusive and picky; and there is absolutely nothing wrong with that. When I say picky, I mean picky in many different respects. Don't be upset about this, there aren’t many people to blame about this. It is something that generally comes with every style.
 
Let me give an example: Here are two shirts, a [Supreme Box Logo](http://img837.imageshack.us/img837/8295/26676270.jpg) shirt and an [Obey Logo tee](http://assets.karmaloop.com/vendor/OBE/zoom/otsblg-whtzoom1.jpg). You ask *generally* anyone in streetwear and they will say that the Supreme shirt is a better shirt. Better in every respect of the word. Most people would say, ""Well its practically the same fucking shirt. Same colors, same design, and similar lettering. Just different words and size. Why aren't both just as cool?"" The reason the Supreme shirt is better than the Obey one is because the streetwear society has given it a more respected name. This doesnt go for JUST similar logos, it pretty much goes for any brand that isnt respected or liked in the streetwear world. So to be 100% bluntly honest, if you wear anything that has an [Obey logo](http://wac.3faa.edgecastcdn.net/803FAA/assets/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/1000x1000/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/0/5/052207.png) on it, people wont like it. And no its not just Obey, I'm only using this as an example... there are hundreds of hated brands.
 
So who is giving these brands such a bad name? [Kids like this](http://31.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m0jhy6OVdA1rpmiymo1_500.gif). Brands like Obey have become incredibly tacky due to over branding by people (teenagers) that think that these designs are very in style. Which is fine, but other people may disagree with this and think there ""style"" isnt good at all. Most people think this. ""Why are kids buying *this* brand?"" Because its cheap and easy to access. Its just that simple. I can walk into my local mall and buy a shit-load of Obey.

&gt; **Branding**
 
Don't be afraid of some brand names! If you want to infuse some streetwear into your looks, you've gotta start being okay with logos on your shirts. However, there is something about logos that make streetwear very dodgy. Many logos are frowned upon in modern streetwear because these logos are frequently worn by ""hypebeasts"", ""swag-fags"" or even... yes... ""fuckbois"". These are not my words, but the words of those who frown upon some brand logos. I am not going to go into detail in ""which"" logos are liked and which are disliked; in the end its personal preference. Just remember, if you have to ask your self ""Does this logo look too tacky/obnoxious?"" then it probably does.
 
---
 
&gt; **Colors**
 
The color of your fit can completely change everything about it. Your probably saying, *No shit Gilbert... thats why different colors exist*, but it can make you go from swag-fag to clean in a few shades. [Take this red for example](http://31.media.tumblr.com/33441a69034c7def6ee6fe84e8f28f9c/tumblr_mr172xnpbS1sbmxtoo1_500.jpg)... this strong pop of color is going to make you stand out so hard in a crowd. You want to avoid these obnoxious colors. So stay away from harsh reds, blues, yellows and oranges unless they are toned by other colors. For example, the same red that you saw in the image above can be [toned by other colors](http://images.jordansdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/kanye-west-wearing-air-jordan-ajko-bred-570x450.jpg) for a good statement item.
 
The most important colors in streetwear are **black** and **white**. Actually, these are shades... Either way, from Black and White you can build and add colors. Colors that are good to add are **navy**, **olive**, and **gray**. I feel that these colors are really safe because this way its hard to clash. Colors like purple can be very hard to pull off unless its in a statement item (see below). Other colors to look into are **Tan** (for chinos), **Brown**, and **Dark Red** (Pomegranate).

&gt; **This looks fine/This looks silly**
 
And now... a game I like to call... This looks fine/This looks silly! A brief overview of what to avoid in streetwear.
 
**Headwear:** Stay away from team logos that aren't the classic logo. [This looks fine](http://www.blogcdn.com/www.bvnewswire.com/media/2009/11/jay-z-jeter-yankees-parade-110609.jpg)/[This looks silly](http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6221/7006449069_5dcddb7bab_z.jpg).
 
**Shirts**: Dont button the top button unless you're wearing a tie. And this is streetwear so don't wear a tie. [This looks fine](http://i.imgur.com/Rleaj.jpg)/[This looks silly](http://fashdloops.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Niall-Horan-One-Direction-2013-Hairstyles-Trends.jpg).
 
**Tees**: Stay away from things that are way too tight, way too bright, way too douche baggy or anything with a huge v. And stay away from cheesy designs. [This looks fine](http://i.imgur.com/bHK6d.jpg)/[This look silly](https://si0.twimg.com/profile_images/1645605367/douchebags_2.jpg).
 
**Sneakers**: Stay away from cheap sneakers and ""new colorways"". Stick to the good quality and classic designs. And if they're expensive... save up. [This looks fine](http://solecollector.com/media/u/images/frank-ocean-air-jordan-i-1-black-blue-header.jpg)/[This look silly](http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y84/JustinsPhotobucket/12-28_fashion-hypebeasts.jpg).
 
**How to find looks to avoid:** 1. Go to tumblr 2. Click search tags 3. Search for the tag #swag
 
*Its that easy*
 
---
 
&gt; **Streetwear Influence**
 
How is streetwear created/influenced? Famous people. Its generally famous people that give the name to the big brands. Some times this is good. Sometimes this is bad. Well its safe to say that the hip-hop collective [Odd Future](http://27.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lgto2nMXPr1qa98opo1_500.jpg) helped boost the popularity of Supreme. Which is fine. But then you end up with kids [like this](http://p.twimg.com/AdDQy2eCQAAApZQ.jpg:large). Kanye West boosted popularity of leather pants and Jordans, and Yeezys. You end up with [this](http://i42.tinypic.com/2utk9kp.jpg). Or [this](http://i.imgur.com/5upt0mO.jpg?1). Its all safe to say that this doesnt look good. Even [ASAP Rocky with Pyrex](http://24.media.tumblr.com/1481990939c24f57d248ff6d902f92b0/tumblr_mmj5njinzr1s2jtf5o1_500.jpg). Then you [get this](http://www.lememe.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/MIKE-THE-RULER-MY-HERO.png).
 
*""Emulate your icons, don't imitate them.*
 
      -- Andre 3000
 
I cannot stress that enough.
 
So yes. People do influence style, but there is a right way to go about it... and a wrong way.

&gt; **Total Brand Guide**
 
*Throughout the guide you'll find recommended brands at the end of each section. This is a total list of general streetwear brands the pertain to pretty much all articles of clothing.*
 
Do not be afraid to seek out new brands. These are just a short list of brands to consider. All I'm trying to do is to get your mind moving in a streetwear direction.
 
**Low Tier - $**
 
- [**Stussy**](http://www.stussy.com/) - Good for starter streetwear. Many classic and basic looks. Very accesable but not too overbranded.
- [**Levis**](http://us.levi.com/home/index.jsp) - A great starter denim brand. Levis cuts are very classic and a decent quality for their price.
- **[Vans](http://www.vans.com/)** - Good footwear brand for generally any budget. Vans have a classic skate style to them.
- **[Uniqlo](http://www.uniqlo.com/us/)** - Use for basic pieces like oxford or tees. Uniqlo frequently does some good collaborations as well (UU, Nat Geo)
- **[DQM](http://dqmnewyork.com/)** - New York skate brand. Similar to Stussy but with more basic looks.
- **[Converse](http://www.converse.com/)** - good original sneakers.
- **[Unbranded](http://theunbrandedbrand.com/collections/all)** - Not super low quality but the lowest price you can get for raw denim.
- **[H&amp;amp;M](http://www.hm.com/us/)** - good for some basic streetwear looks if youre on a low budget.
- **[Undefeated](http://undefeated.com/)** - Sportswear influence streetwear brand with some decent pieces.

The purpose of this guide is to help steer beginners in the right direction when shopping. This list is meant to be an informative resource, not a standalone blacklist. Almost every brand has something worth getting (e.g. canvas belt, white socks, tees); however this guide is intended to give a brand summary about certain companies and designs, especially as it concerns questionable content. 


##Please Read

* I have taken the community's comments into consideration and will continue to do so. If you think a brand does not belong, please write a thorough argument in the comments below. I am not claiming that all of these brands are 100% horrible, many of them have redeemable elements. However, a buyer should be wary of the listed issues with these brands. Shop critically and do research before purchasing. 
* If you like some of these brands, I beg that you don't take it personally - please write a well thought out argument in the comments. If anything is unclear, please state your complaint below.
* Note that some of these brands are sporty. I am not suggesting that sportwear should not be used for track or sport. I am simply arguing that a buyer should be careful not to wear certain activewear as casualwear.
* And finally, if it looks good - wear it. If you like it, then do what you want. I'm not telling anyone how to behave, these are just suggestions and summaries intended to aid beginners.

##Key

Popular reasons for being on this list: 

    [PQ] - Poor Quality, including inferior construction, inferior materials and inconsistent quality control.
    [UD] - Ugly Design, overstylized products, especially graphic-tees. 
    [OB] - Over Branding, large and frequent logos and branding
    [EP] - Exorbitant Price, quality-per-dollar below average peer

##List

* **Abercrombie and Fitch** [OB] Frequently overbranded clothing. Quality is fine, if a bit overpriced. Not bad on sale if you own a seamripper.
* **Aeropostale** [OB] [PQ] Almost everything in this store has tons of branding. Quality is subpar.
* **Affliction** [UD] [EP] Too many gaudy graphics. Quality does not justify the price.
* **Aldo** [PQ] [UD] Glued soles. Horrible quality control. Many reports of shoes falling apart within a few months. Terrible leather.
* **American Eagle** [OB] Quality is actually not that bad. However, too many graphics, too much branding. Essentially an A+F clone.
* **Armani Exchange** [EP] Poor materials, low quality control. Obnoxious branding. Price doesn't reflect quality.
* **Ben Sherman** [EP] [PQ] Most of the clothing here will be low quality and over-priced.
* **Birkenstocks [UD]** Unattractive shoe-sandal hybrid. Comfortable around the house, not advised for leaving the house. Stigmatically associated with hippies. 
* **Chaps** [PQ] Quality ranges. Most of this stuff is horrible material, poor construction, poor quality control. Rarely you can find something that may be worth buying on clearance if you are completely strapped for cash.
* **CK** [PQ] Diffusion brand. Bad fabric, made in China. Even on sale, their shirts aren't worth $15. Much better suiting available at the price.
* **Crocs** [UD] Swiss cheese plastic shoes. Also make hideous slip-ons and lace-up shoes.
* **Diesel** [UD] Definitive over-distressed jeans. Some of their stuff is acceptable if you can find it on a steep sale (some sneakers, nondistressed denim).
* **Dom Rebel** [UD] [EP] Overpriced pointless graphics.
* **Ecco** [UD] - Their overall shoe collection is inelegant and/or overstylized. Many complaints of quality control with their soles. However, their boots have a good reputation for utility in snow and salt.
* **Ecko Unltd.** [UD] Unnecessarily busy with graphics and detailing. 
* **Ed Hardy** [EP] [UD] Cheesy graphics with subpar quality-per-dollar. Not worth considering.
* **FCUK** [OB] [EP] Too much branding, low quality-per-dollar ratio. Inconsistent. Poor quality control.
* **Guess** [OB] [PQ] Poor quality-per-dollar ratio overall. Ugly screenprints. Mild overbranding. Only buy at a steep discount. Jeans worth considering at a mild discount.
* **Hollister** [OB] Branding on everything. Expensive for the quality. Fine if you can find something unbranded on sale.
* **Hot Topic** [UD] Graphic tees. Poor materials. Ugly branding.
* **Hush Puppies** [UD] Inelegant. These are made with comfort in mind, but they sacrifice aesthetic. If you've got no one to impress at the office, then they're fine, but these are not attractive shoes.
* **Jos. A Bank** [PQ] Poor construction, poor quality materials. People buy them because they are cheap, but it is not worth the money.
* **J Shoes** [UD] Cheap design, and it shows in the aesthetic. Plain unattractive shoes.
* **Kenneth Cole Reaction** [PQ] [UD] Diffusion brand (KC in label only). Poor materials, poor design, poor construction.
* **Kmart** [PQ] Low quality materials, poor quality control, poor construction.
* **Lee** [UD] [PQ] Quality is poor, but pretty proportionate to price. Cuts are unflattering, generally not advised.
* **Lucky Brand Jeans** [UD] Overdesigned, overdistressed.
* **Men's Wearhouse** [PQ] Poor materials, poor construction, cheap quality.
* **Michael Kors** [PQ] [UD] Not a bad women's brand, but the stuff for men is poorly designed, and poorly made.
* **Oakley Sport** [UD] Their Lifestyle sunglasses are fine, and quality is completely fine, but their sport merchandise should not be worn sartorially, as it is overstylized and obtuse.
* **Quiksilver** [UD] [OB] Overbranded, overstylzed, too many graphics. Quality inferior for price, fine for sporting activities.
* **Rock and Republic** [UD] Overstylized. Low quality-per-dollar. Bad cuts. Ugly prints.
* **Rockports** [UD] Obtuse. Poor profile. Ugly lasts. Not good materials.
* **Sean John** [UD] Overstyled. Too many pictures/designs. Price not reflected in materials.
* **Skechers** [UD] Busy, overdesigned. Juvenile.
* **Steve Madden** [UD] [PQ] Very low quality materials. Very poor construction. Design is inferior.
* **ThinkGeek** [UD] [PQ] Materials are subpar, designs are very bad. Too many graphic tees.
* **Threadless** [UD] Fabric is ok for the price but the pictures and designs are not advisable.
* **TOMs** [UD] [PQ] Poorly designed espadrilles prone to falling apart. There are plenty of great espadrilles out there for the same price.
* **True Religion** [UD] [EP] Most of their stuff is overstylized or overdistressed. Quality is not reflect in the price.
* **Uggs** [UD] Not a good look for men. Their boots are busy and obtuse.
* **Van Heusen** [PQ] Very cheap clothing, and it's reflected in the quality.
* **Vibram Five-fingers** [UD] Some love them for track or sports. However, these should never be worn sartorially.
* **Walmart** [PQ] If you buy your underwear here that's good and fine. However, most of the clothes here are quite low quality. The materials and construction are bad. A large ratio of this stuff is novelty graphic tees.
* **Woot** [PQ] [UD] Poor fabric, juvenile designs.
* **Wrangler** [PQ] Many unflattering cuts. Lower bursting strength and higher weave deformations. Denim-finishing chemicals are lower quality, and the fabric quality control has lower standards. Seam and zipper strength is inferior. 
* **Yesstyle Brands** [PQ] Very deceptive pictures, everything is pinned and the lighting is meant to trick the buyer. Poor quality materials, poor construction, stay far away.
* **Zoo York** [UD] Busy graphic-heavy punk skater brand. Materials aren't terrific
* **7 For All Mankind** [EP] Frequently-distressed jeans with cuts inferior to many brands in this price category.

Note: Clarks and Timberland make some great stuff, but much of what they make is ugly and overstylized. Forgivable because of the Desert Boot, Mali boot, Abington line, and some Earthkeeper wear is acceptable.

##Affordable Alternatives

* *American Apparel* - Great value on tees.
* *H+M* - Slim clothes for cheap. Fabric isn't terrific but it gets the job done.
* *Land's End Canvas* - Large selection of affordable clothing of acceptable quality
* *Levi's* - Good fit for the price range, higher quality standards than its peers.
* *LL Bean* - Good quality, good selection, [satisfaction guaranteed](http://www.llbean.com/shop/returns/).
* *Uniqlo* - One of the best values out there. Slim, well constructed clothes at affordable price.
* *Zara* - Many cheap options with solid quality. Broad selection. Definitely worth trying.

Community Suggestions:

* *Banana Republic* - Decent shirting, decent outerwear, good sweaters, good pants. Frequently has sales.
* *Club Monaco* - Some people love it, some people don't. They definitely have some affordable pieces, at least worth checking out.
* *Dockers* - This brand used to be for your dad, but now their cuts are pretty slim and they're definitely affordable.
* *Eddie Bauer* - Good outdoor/workwear clothing. For affordability, cop during a sale. A lot of their line exits the ""affordability"" region, so just stick to what you can buy.
* *Express* - Some people really like the fit of their shirts. Their producer pant also has a good reputation.
* *Gap* - Cheaper than J Crew or BR, but quality isn't quite as good. Good for budget outerwear, cheap sweaters, cheap pants, and cheap tees if they fit well.
* *J Crew* - Solid shirting and outerwear. Buy it on sale for best value, 15% student discount.
* *Target Missoni* (basics only) - Good reputation on tees and underwear. Avoid everything but the basics.
* *Vans* - Acceptable, cheap, low profile sneakers. Half their fare is eh, avoid their clothing.",,False,self,t5_2r65t,True,,,True,t3_lnr90,http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/lnr90/brands_a_cautionary_overview/,

He was notorious during college for it, but now that he's graduated it may be time for a mature change. He's not willing to give fashion much thought, but if I happen to mention in the mall that he would look awesome in something, he might give it a try. What are casual items that are fashionable and yet might appeal to someone who has a hard time taking off wolf shirts? Also, what are some good stores for men's clothing that also have a women's section?

EDIT: Thanks everyone for the thoughtful responses. I was really just looking for some alternative suggestions I could give him for clothing that he would look good in and like, and I think I have a better idea now. The next time we go shopping, I'm probably going to point out certain styles and tell him those turn me on (the truth). This way he will have a reason to want to adopt that style as his own, rather than just having me pressure him to conform. If you're somehow reading this babe, know that I will love you just as much even if you wear wolf shirts in your 40's! But if you are open to some self improvement, I'd be glad to help out and make the process easier on you.

I have given the decision some thought, and I cannot in good conscience maintain my authority without participating in the duties the community expects and deserves. The issue is that I don't currently have the time to give sufficient attention to my responsibilities as moderator, and I don't believe I will have that luxury in the near future. For a long while, I was sure that my schedule would lighten and I would be able to return to the active administration and guide-writing that I enjoy. Unfortunately, it has become apparent that my schedule will remain busy.

In the future, if I find myself with more free time, I would be happy to serve the community again. However, until that time comes, it is unfair for me to keep my post.

I thank the community for trusting my judgment, and I thank both the current and past moderators for their service which helped shape this great subreddit.

[Let's go.](http://imgur.com/a/YTnWR) 

**Why?**

I could lay out reasons all day about how some shoes are designed to be worn sockless or how it cools you off on hot days, but the *truth*? It looks cool and carefree and nonchalant.  *Summer*, in other words. And I'm sick of justifying style decisions with half-bullshit functional reasons to satisfy STEM-minded redditors, so that's enough.  


**How?**

That's a better question.  I jotted down a quick outline about this, and then realized [Put This On basically nailed it two years ago.](http://putthison.com/post/5162542257/guide-to-going-sockless-with-esquire-and-brooks)  Read Derek's article, but here's the short version:

 * Take care of your feet in the shower.  The trickle-down method is not enough.  *The trickle-down method is not enough.*  Scrub them with a good, antibacterial soap and you'll pre-empt most of the foot-stink before your feet even touch your shoes.  Note: You should probably be doing this whether or not you go sockless.

 * Take care of your shoes.  Use cedar shoes trees or crumpled newspaper to help them dry  out between wears, and wait *at least* 24 hours before re-wearing a pair of shoes.  48 hours is better.  Buy more shoes if you must.  Note: Ditto about doing this whether or not you wore the shoes with socks.

 * Stop sweat with some preventative maintenance.  A light shake of [Gold Bond powder](http://www.amazon.com/Gold-Bond-Foot-Powder-Medicated/dp/B001552XJK/ref=sr_1_1?s=hpc&amp;srs=2592762011&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1372427693&amp;sr=1-1) or baby powder is probably all you need.  If your foot-sweat is more serious, pick up a pair or two of [washable terrycloth insoles.](http://www.amazon.com/Pedag-196-Washable-Mens-10/dp/B001G0NSY8/ref=pd_sim_sbs_hpc_8)  And if you need socks but still want the look, [no-show loafer socks](http://putthison.com/post/663604643/the-liberating-world-of-no-show-socks-we-got-an) are cheap and effective.  Look for the kind with silicon grip on the heel so they don't slip off.  For what it's worth, none of this may be necessary if your feet don't sweat much.  I don't bother with any of it personally.

 * If you're prone to blisters, preventative maintenance can help there too.  A dab of vaseline on the spot where the shoes rub is the simplest, but a [moleskin patch](http://www.amazon.com/Dr-Scholls-Moleskin-Padding-Packages/dp/B001EPQG1M/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1372432361&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=moleskin+patch) is better for more painful friction.",,False,self,t5_2r65t,1372506797.0,,,True,t3_1h8xo0,http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/1h8xo0/a_guide_to_ditching_your_socks_from_now_to/,

1368915808.0,590,self.malefashionadvice,1ell5j,The Fabric Guide (as requested),687,97,75,http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/1ell5j/the_fabric_guide_as_requested/,"Fabrics are one of the most overlooked aspects of clothing for beginners—fabrics play a huge role in the aesthetics, use, and cost of clothing. When buying clothes (or having them made) knowing about fabrics is essential. 

**I. Terminology**

*  *Thread Count*: The number of woven yarns in a square inch. In other words it’s a measure of density. Higher thread count means that the weave will be tighter (like bed sheets) and lower thread count means that the weave will be more open (like burlap). 
*  *Plys*: Raw material needs to be spun into yarn (imagine a piece of rope), which are then woven into fabric. 1-ply = a single thread was used in the weaving process. 2-ply = two threads were twisted together and then woven. Typically, a 2-ply shirt will be stronger, more resilient to wear, and last longer. [Here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Spool_of_white_thread.jpg) is a spool of 2-ply thread where you can see the two threads twisted together. 
*  *Yarn Number*: When it comes to shirting this is more important than Thread Count. Yarns vary in how smooth or rough they are. Higher yarn numbers indicate that the threads used are thinner and finer, which is what makes luxury shirts feel smooth and soft to the touch.  Lower yarn numbers result in fabrics that are thicker and coarser. [In this image](http://i.imgur.com/MxIcJmF.jpg) you can compare a swatch of fabric with 100 yarn number on the left with one that is 200 on the right. You can actually see how the threads on the right are approximately half the size of those on the left. The compromise for higher yarn counts is that they’re far less durable. Shirts can be found as low as 24 or as high as 200+ but most quality shirts typically range from 80-120 (too low and you’re getting into low quality fabrics, too high and the trade-off for longevity may not be worth it). 
If you see a shirt advertised as 100/2 then that means the yarn number is 100 and the yarn has been spun 2-ply. 

*  *W&amp;W*: The yarn going vertically on the loom is called “warp” and the yarn going horizontally is known as “weft” [image](http://cdn8.nazmiyalantiquerugs.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/warp_weft_diagram.gif). Sometimes manufacturers advertise shirts as being 2-ply but cut costs by using only 2-ply in the warp but not the weft.
If you see a shirt that’s 100/2x2, it’s the manufacturer’s way of letting you know that it’s a true 2-ply shirt. 


**II. Types**

Weave is what affects the nature of the fabric more than anything else. There are too many types to discuss in detail so this guide covers the most common ones you’ll come across but is by no means exhaustive.


1. [Poplin and Broadcloth](http://i.imgur.com/yv55D6H.jpg):  The most common fabric used in shirting. It’s a plain weave which means that it’s created using an “over and under” pattern between the warp (vertical yarn) and weft (horizontal yarn). It results in a fairly light, durable and crisp weave that’s ideal for formal occasions. Its resistance to wrinkling has made it the classic choice for dress shirts. Keep in mind that differences in the quality of raw cotton, and in plys and yarn number, will result in a huge range of quality. Because it is so ubiquitous you’ll get some very thin, almost translucent broadcloths (visible nipples) but also some that are quite substantial and suitable for wear in winter.


2. [End-on-End](http://i.imgur.com/In6hJeF.jpg): This is the same plain weave seen above but different coloured yarns are interspersed within the fabric’s “over and under” pattern. The result is something that’s more visually distinct and interesting to look at [up-close](http://i.imgur.com/CnxHndF.jpg), yet retains  the characteristic properties of poplin/broadcloth which make them desirable. This is essentially what [chambray](http://i.imgur.com/bhRv847.jpg) is, except that chambray undergoes a finishing process where it’s pressed by rollers at high temperatures (which creates a glossy effect). Many people assume that chambray and denim (discussed below) are essentially the same thing but they’re completely different weaves.


3. [Oxford](http://i.imgur.com/1TJaXRF.jpg): One of MFA’s most beloved fabrics, oxford cloth is a type of basket weave. It uses the same “over and under pattern” discussed above but an additional floating yarn passes across. Typically the yarns used are more coarse and thick (lower yarn number). Both the rougher yarn and the nature of the weave result in texture. The richer texture makes it more suitable for casual wear, it wrinkles more easily, and the added floating yarn is more susceptible to snags making it less durable. Some of the “flaws” of this fabric are really what makes it great though; an OCBD that’s been beat to hell becomes very soft and can look incredibly beautiful (similar to the fading of raw denim or patina on leather). 


4. [Pinpoint](http://imgur.com/4s2aMDx): Essentially the same weave as the standard oxford, but with yarns that are thinner and finer and woven tighter (similar to those used for broadcloth/poplin). Think of it as the middle ground between broadcloth/poplin and oxford. It’s an incredibly versatile weave that retains texture while preserving a more formal look that’s acceptable to wear under a suit.  


5. [Royal Oxford](http://i.imgur.com/tsaeRIX.jpg): Has nothing to do with oxford or pinpoint fabrics because the weave is fairly elaborate and uses four yarns. The result is something that has substantial texture but remains very shiny. As you look at it from different angles it almost appears to glimmer. It is more formal than both oxford or pinpoint fabrics and is actually very pretty to look at. 


6. [Twill](http://i.imgur.com/EEjPuzg.jpg): Essentially a diagonal weave created by yarns woven at an [offset over-under weave](http://i.imgur.com/ZGMlJC6.gif). It’s a very subtle way to add texture to an outfit and the weave tends to be very soft, heavy and easy to iron. The downsides are that it will never look as crisp as broadcloth/poplin and stains are harder to remove (though it’s harder to get twill dirty in the first place). It’s perhaps the most versatile fabric simply because there are so many types of twill. Many luxury dress shirts make very high yarn count twills since the weave itself is so incredibly dense.
[Flannel](http://i.imgur.com/GZZk7SK.jpg) is basically brushed twill that retains its substantial weight but is less shiny much softer, thus making it very casual. 
If you look closely at your [denim](http://i.imgur.com/lVyCham.jpg) or [chinos](http://i.imgur.com/g2ECNp0.jpg) you’ll notice that they are both examples of a twill weave. 
If you own [tweed](http://i.imgur.com/IZhxuYX.jpg) you’ll notice that it’s wool twill. 
[Pick-and-Pick (aka Sharkskin)](http://i.imgur.com/ztKpgmN.jpg) was the suiting fabric that Pierce Brosnan wore as James Bond to make him stand out subtly without using too much colour. It doesn’t look like the other twills because it’s made with alternating colours within the tiny ""zig-zags"". The result is something that looks like a cross-hatch overlaying the usual diagonal weave. The technique and effect achieved is pretty similar to end-on-end. 
While we’re here, I want to point out that [herringbone](http://i.imgur.com/khtcIMK.jpg) is not a weave, but rather a pattern in which the diagonal wales of twill reverse. Similarly [houndstooth](http://i.imgur.com/HAJTow9.jpg) is also a pattern of twill that uses the same weave.  


7. [Nailhead or Birdseye](http://i.imgur.com/bMmuKwW.jpg) the weave is aptly named and remarkably beautiful. It’s not super common but you can occasionally find them in suits (especially with custom makers). 


**III. Conclusions**

There are a huge array of different fabrics to choose from—each with their own advantages and disadvantages. Many factors play into the quality of a fabric from the quality of raw material itself, to how the yarn is spun, to how it is woven and finished. It may seem overwhelming to a beginner but as you try on different shirts take note of what works for you, and the type of fabric you’re handling (or ask the sale’s associate). You’ll gradually develop a pretty instinctive touch for quality and develop your own preferences. From there you can start playing with the patterns in different fabrics (bengal stripes, gingham, tattersall, plaid etc.). 

I hope this clarifies some of confusion. If I’m missing something, or it’s inaccurate then feel free to correct/add/remove from this.

I tried to make it as comprehensive as possible for a beginner, while avoiding restating what has been said elsewhere on MFA. I've pointed people who are interested further to as many other resources as possible.

**Fit** 

The most important part of the suit is the fit. One illustration on the importance of fit can be seen [here](http://i.imgur.com/aAIFbCB.jpg).

There are three general types of suit cuts, though in reality the cuts will vary depending on the brand. You don't see these names used too often, as many brands will come up with their own names for the different fits they have, but they are the [Italian cut](http://imgur.com/oP9hFEg,EArCuYX,d5zkOBA#2), [English cut](http://imgur.com/oP9hFEg,EArCuYX,d5zkOBA#1), and [American cut](http://imgur.com/oP9hFEg,EArCuYX,d5zkOBA).

*How Should My Suit Fit?* - I'm going to be doing this a lot here, but if you want to know in depth how all these items should fit, check out [shujin's excellent guide on the sidebar](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/ehrtv/shujins_comprehensive_fit_guide/). The short illustrated version is that you want your pants to drape like [this](http://i.imgur.com/XACQz.jpg), with a single break at the top of your shoes. Proper jacket fitting can be seen [here](http://imgur.com/x5j9NQv).

*Tailoring* - Almost anything in the suit can be tailored. The most important thing however is the shoulder fit - while it technically can be tailored, you need an extremely good tailor and it'll be highly expensive, so you're best off making sure this fits off the rack. For more details on the prices/difficulty of various tailoring procedures, I'll direct you to this [Guide to Clothing Alteration](http://www.artofmanliness.com/2009/10/01/alteration_guide/).

Let's dive into some specifics!

**Jacket**

*Single versus Double breasted* - The difference is illustrated [here](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2e/Single-Double-Breasted.svg). Single breasted is more popular right now, but double breasted seem to be making a comeback. Of the two, double-breasted is the more traditional, and it lends itself better to older men's style (roughly 40+) as well as larger men. For single breasted the standard is 2 buttons, while double breasted the standard is three rows of buttons.

*Buttons* - Buttons are found in two places on a suit jacket, the center and the cuffs. 

Cuffs - On higher quality suits, cuff buttons will be functional ([surgeon's cuffs](http://imgur.com/Ovf4HDc,tCpHMtN,9CGzt2w,qWrbuc7#3)) while cheaper suits they'll be sewn on only as decoration. If functional, these should stay buttoned at all times. Note that buying a shirt off the rack with surgeon's cuffs makes it very difficult though not impossible to get the sleeve length tailored.

Chest - Single breasted suits are further divided into two and three buttons. For a single breasted suit with two buttons, only the top button should be buttoned. On a single breasted, three button suit, the bottom button is once again left open, with the middle button always buttoned. The top button is a matter of preference. With a double breasted, the middle button should be buttoned at all times while the top row of buttons are decorative. The bottom button, again, should stay unbuttoned.

*Lapels* - For suits, the best/most common option is the [notch lapel](http://imgur.com/Ovf4HDc,tCpHMtN,9CGzt2w,qWrbuc7#1). The other two options are peak and shawl lapels, but these are both generally more seen in black tie on a tuxedo, especially shawl collar.

*Vents* - A vent is the name for the slit opening in the rear of the jacket. You can have [one, two, or zero vents](http://imgur.com/Ovf4HDc,tCpHMtN,9CGzt2w,qWrbuc7#2) in your jacket. Two vents tends to be the most flattering style on everyone. One vent can work, but it tends to draw attention to your rear - if this is what you're going for get a single vent. If you're not sure if you want to do this or not, you probably don't. No vents is only really done on a Tuxedo, you'd be hard pressed to even find it on a jacket.

*Sleeve Length* - Dress shirts should come down to the base of the thumb. The safest bet for jacket sleeve length is to show a little bit of shirt sleeve, approximately 1/4 inch, and make sure your jacket cuffs are the same size as your shirt cuffs. For a more in-depth explanation, as well as pictures, see [this article](https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/sleeve-length-suits-shirts-jackets/).

*Construction* - Jackets can be either fused, half canvas, or full canvas, in order from cheapest to most expensive. If you want more details [Put This On has a good article about jacket construction](http://putthison.com/post/53763514327/why-pay-
for-canvas-as-many-readers-know-suit).

**Pants**

*Pleats* - ~~Pleated pants generally aren't flattering. The one exception is if you're larger, they may make you look better. However when in doubt you're better off going with flat front pants.~~ Pleated pants can look good with the proper rise and taper. When wearing a suit jacket it will usually cover whether your pants are pleated or not. The main point in favor of pleats is that they offer more space and comfort than flat front pants do - hence why they are recommended for larger guys. 

*Break* - Suit pants should have a single break in them, at the top of your shoe. [This picture](http://i.imgur.com/XACQz.jpg) is a good example of a single break. If you want to go for a more trendy look, you can also opt to have no break at all - but be careful that your socks aren't showing while standing!

*Cuffs* - Cuffing is the practice of turning up the bottom of your pants for various effects. [Here](http://imgur.com/dx9GUBj,hlR5KcS) is Marlon Brando cuffing his pants in order to show off his boots. [This](http://imgur.com/dx9GUBj,hlR5KcS#1) picture is a little more germane to this discussion since it features a man in a suit with cuffed pants. Cuffing slacks can be used to create the appearance of shorter legs by adding more visual weight to the bottom of the legs. Some further suggestions for when to cuff, as well as a history of cuffing, can be found at [The Parisian Gentleman](http://parisiangentleman.co.uk/2013/07/24/a-second-look-at-trouser-turnups-cuffs/).

**Vest (Waistcoat)**

Vests are best worn with single-breasted suits. They can be worn with double-breasted, but in most cases you wouldn't be able to see the vest. They are certainly not a necessity, but they do make a suit more formal than it would otherwise be, as well as much warmer. A safe choice of vest is one of the same material and pattern as the rest of the suit - differing patterns or colors can work, but as this is an introductory guide I won't touch on that. 

Vests themselves can come in either single- or double-breasted, and either is a viable option. In this case it's actually the reverse of suit jackets - single breasted is the more traditional option with vests, though double breasted can work equally well. In both cases, you want to keep the very bottom button open much as with the suit jacket.

Outside the US, what we refer to as vests are called waistcoats.

**Purchasing**

The biggest choice you'll have to make about suit purchasing is whether to buy a made to measure suit (MTM) or a suit off the rack (OTR). With a MTM suit, as the name implies, somebody takes your measurements - or in the case of online retailers, you take your own - and a suit is built specific to those measurements. The trade off of course is this method tends to be more expensive and takes longer to receive your suit. Off the rack on the other hand is buying a suit as it comes from the retailer. With an off the rack suit, in 99.99% of cases, you're going to want to get some alterations done so it fits you better. Many department stores will offer this service if you buy your suit from them, but look around and see if you have any local tailors that can do alterations.

Here's some places to buy (good/expensive) suiting, along with rough price brackets for each. Note that this list is definitely not definitive, but it'll give you somewhere to start.

At lower price points all of the above still apply - the suits themselves will not wear nearly as well however and will deteriorate quicker. The fit on many of them is often sub-par, though individual results may vary. The best way to get a cheap suit that looks good is to buy one under your budget and get it tailored as much as possible. If anyone knows of cheaper suits that are better than others, PM me or leave a comment.

1. Having discovered the tailor some of you went crazy. Pants and shirts are way too tight here. Fitted is good, painted on is not. People in really tight clothing never look relaxed and come off as effeminate.

2. The unqualified hatred of graphic tees needs to be qualified. The right person can pull of the right shirt. That's true of a lot of clothing. MFA is way too binary. Swag exist. Kanye looks good in that clothing. Even if most people wouldn't. 

3. Tucking button downs in jeans looks really weird. 

4. Boat shoes and desert boots are two of 50 acceptable choices. I wish the other 48 made more of an appearance.

1310752155.0,560,self.malefashionadvice,iqljj,A Guide to Cologne,718,158,161,http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/iqljj/a_guide_to_cologne/,"**Cologne**:Wearing cologne is a chemistry experiment. A bottle of cologne will contain extracts, oils, alcohol, preservatives and water.  The wide variety of colognes comes from the differences in the combination of oils and the ratios of the other ingredients.  The extracts and oils mix with your own unique bodily oils and heat pattern to evaporate over time and create your own unique scent.


**Types**: The different type is related to cologne’s strength and lasting power.  The higher percentage of aromatic compounds (more chemicals to evaporate), the longer it lasts.

* **Eau de Cologne**: 3-7%  of aromatic compounds: This means that it is much lighter than the concentrated perfume. It is delightfully refreshing in hot weather and because it doesn't last long, it can be frequently reapplied directly to the skin. It tends to be marketed in large sizes of up to 200 ml and is often applied by spray. Its duration is 2 to 3 hours.

* **Eau de Toilette**: 7-12% of aromatic compounds: Eau de Toilette is more concentrated than Eau de Cologne. The top notes are dominant, making it refreshing when it is applied, and it evaporates and fades away quite quickly.  It is the most common product on the market and its duration is 2 to 4 hours. 

* **Eau de Perfume (Parfum)**: 10-20% of aromatic compounds: This solution is more intense and lasts longer.  After the top notes have died away, the middle notes or heart notes of a perfume become noticeable. Since it is less intense than perfume extract, it is also cheaper, but it usually lasts well and is sold in small sizes. It usually lasts 3 to 5 hours.

* **Perfume (Parfum)**: &gt;20% of aromatic compounds. This is the most expensive version of any fragrance.  This is due to the high concentration of essences. Perfume is applied directly to the skin on pulse spots. Only a tiny amount is needed, which is reflected in the sizes in which it is sold. The scent lasts the longest, normally up to 6 hours.


**Categories**:
**[The Fragrance Wheel](http://www.sniffapaloozamagazine.com/Fragrance_Wheel_2010_English.jpg)**: At the center of the wheel is the fougere group (not shown). This grouping of fragrances contains elements of all of the other four groupings and is then by definition its own family with both distinctions and commonality. Each of the other four groups occupies equidistant places around the perimeter of the wheel. Each of these families has subheadings, which further describe their scents. Men's cologne uses [combinations of all of the groups](http://www.fragrancesoftheworld.com/downloads/The%20Fragrance%20Wheel.jpg).

* **Floral**: This family contains three sub-headings, which are floral, soft floral and floral Oriental. The sub-heading of floral contains the fragrances of fresh flowers, such as gardenia, jasmine, honeysuckle, lilac and orchid. Soft floral contains aldehydes, such as cinnanaldehyde, which gives the color and aroma to cinnamon. It also contains soft notes or powders such as, Russian rose, Moroccan jasmine and amber powder. Floral Oriental contains orange blossoms and sweet spices.

* **Oriental**: The subheadings are soft Oriental, Oriental and woody Oriental. Soft Oriental is all about incense and amber, whereas the Oriental sub-head features Oriental resins, musks and vanilla. The woody Oriental group contains aromatic woods such as sandalwood and patchouli.

* **Fresh**: Citrus, fruity, green and water comprise this group. Citrus features lemon, lime and orange oils. Fruity is as it sounds, having fragrances such as tangerine, raspberry, banana and strawberry. Green smells like leaves and grass, whereas water uses a chemical called calone. This compound is described as a fragrance that smells like a strong sea breeze that has a slight floral scent added to it.

* **Woody**: The sub-heads are wood, mossy woods and dry woods. This family's wood subhead contains aromatic woods such as frankincense, myrrh and cedar. The mossy woods use fragrances such as oak moss and the dry woods actually have fragrances such as tobacco and leather.


[**Notes**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Fragrance_pyramid.svg):
Most colognes go through a progression: top notes (last a few minutes), heart notes (2-30 minutes to an hour), and base notes (longer than an hour).  This is caused by the differences in volality (rate at which compound evaporates) between the essential oils.

* **Top (Head) Notes**: Perceived immediately upon application of a perfume, top notes consist of small, light molecules that evaporate quickly. They form a person's initial impression of a perfume and thus are very important in the selling of a perfume. The scents of this note class are usually described as ""fresh,"" ""assertive"" or ""sharp."" The compounds that contribute to top notes are strong in scent, very volatile, and evaporate quickly. Citrus and ginger scents are common top notes. Also called the head notes. If one compares a fragrance with a conversation, then the top notes are the presentations and introduction. 

* **Middle (Heart) Notes**: The scent of a perfume that emerges just prior to when the top notes dissipate. Scents from this note class appear anywhere from two minutes to one hour after the application of a perfume. The middle note compounds form the ""heart"" or main body of a perfume and emerge in the middle of the perfume's dispersion process. They serve to mask the often unpleasant initial impression of base notes, which become more pleasant with time. Not surprisingly, the scent of middle note compounds is usually more mellow and ""rounded”. The heart notes of men’s fragrances are often based on combinations of flowers such as lavender and rose. They are also called the ""heart notes"".

* **Base**: The scent of a perfume that appears close to the departure of the middle notes. They usually not perceived until at least 30 minutes after the application of the perfume or during the period of perfume dry-down. The base and middle notes together are the main theme of a perfume. Base notes bring depth and solidity to a perfume. Compounds of this class are often the fixatives used to hold and boost the strength of the lighter top and middle notes. Consisting of large, heavy molecules that evaporate slowly, compounds of this class of scents are typically rich and ""deep"". The combination of base notes often use species of tree, very varied: birch, sandalwood, oak, cinnamon.  Depending on the species, different parts of the tree are used: bark, sap, wood itself.


**The Next Step: Buying, Wearing and Storing the Cologne**: Choose the cologne that fits you or your occasion. The amount of cologne to wear is based on the strength of the cologne: Strong smells acquire less cologne. Also, people tend to underestimate how much their cologne smells.  If someone can smell you from more than 2 feet away, it is TOO much.

* **How to Buy &amp; Try**: Maximum to try at once is about 4 (2 suggested).  Spray one on each wrist and each inner elbow.  While you can use the cards the department store provides to smell the colognes, you will only smell the top notes and not how it smells on you. Between smelling each cologne, refresh your palate with something strong, like coffee beans (usually provided). Smell all the notes! The initial smell isn’t necessarily the one that lingers for the rest of the day (called the “dry down”). Walk around the department store or mall, and smell the colognes at various intervals (1 minute, 5 minute, 30 minutes, 1 hour, etc.)

* **How to Store it**: Keep in a dry place, away from direct light, heat (especially if it is a clear bottle), and keep the lid closed.  Colognes are bottles full of oils, chemicals and extracts, they can go bad!

* **Where to Apply**:Ideal place to apply cologne is where the body produces the [most heat]( http://www.infraredcamerasinc.com/images/Medical-Infrared-Thermography/Thermal-Infrared-Full-Body-Scan.jpg), typically where the major sweat glands are located.  Common areas: wrists, underarms, chest, neck, thighs, back of knees, inner elbows, crotch.  This does NOT mean to spray each section! I suggest to always do wrists and neck.  These are the areas women most likely will encounter when close to you. 

* **How to Apply**:Spray 2-6 inches away from the skin. If you are applying cologne from a regular bottle, take one finger and press it against the opening of your bottle, and then tip it over gently. Do not splash too much out of the bottle. 

* **My Standard technique**: Spray wrist. Lightly press them together, then press at neck under the jaw. Depending on the cologne, maybe a spray at the crotch or chest, or an extra wrist presses to the underarms.  The powerful colognes typically only get the wrist and neck, as it is more than enough.

* **Scent Overload**: Don't drown out your cologne with a lot of scented shampoos, shower gels, deordorant, aftershave, etc.  Colognes might also come with shower gels, aftershave and shampoos.  They don't necessarily smell exactly the same as the cologne. Overall, be smart with your combinations.  

* **Tips**: Apply cologne to your dry skin, not your clothes.  If your body is wet from a shower, the water will disrupt the cologne’s ability to interact with your oils, and also evaporate more quickly. Don’t rub the cologne in: Friction causes it to evaporate more quickly, instead of its natural process.  A press or pat together is okay. 

* **Popular &amp; Trustworthy Colognes**: Go [here](http://www.basenotes.net/). It depends on YOUR BODY. Find your own. My personal favorites that smell good on ME: Light Blue by D&amp;G, Armani Code, 9IX by Rocawear, Aqua Di Gio (although I never wear it anymore).

A few days ago, my truck began over heating. I pulled to the side of the road and looked below and saw that my truck was leaking blue fluid. Opened the hood, and without touching anything, my overflow valve for my coolant blew up in my face. I have second degree burns all on the right side of my face, including severe blisters on my ear.


This has given me a problem, as now my face is extremely sensitive to sunlight. The doctor suggested wide brimmed hats, and the only kind I can think of are fedoras, and lord knows I do not want to wear one of those. I'll buy one if I have too, as function must definitely override fashion in this case, but I want to try to have both.

Take your opportunity to celebrate with the happy couple, meet some new people, and reacquaint with old friends. Congratulate the parents of the bride on how beautiful their daughter looks or how lovely the wedding has been. Bring your card with you (you did get them a card, right?), but have the gift mailed to their house (with the gift receipt). Be respectful and most of all, HAVE SOME FUN. Your outfit is the last thing on anyone's mind.** 

*This guide offers some tips and ideas on how you can make the most of your outfit on somebody else's special day. It will be mostly American-centric due to my lack of knowledge concerning International/British customs. Please feel free to chime-in. Again, this is advice, nobody on /r/mfa knows you, your family, friends, or the couple getting married like you do, asking them for advice is a good idea too.*

___
**TL;DR: Choosing appropriate attire for a wedding is quite simple:**

1. Follow any stated or implied dress code. Ask someone close to the bride or groom if you're unsure.
2. Wear something appropriate for the occasion. Your outfit should be smart and festive, it should NOT be golfing, clubbing, business, or funeral attire.
3. Don't overdress or attempt something too flamboyant. You'll want to wear clothing you're comfortable with and you don't want to accidentally upstage the bride or groom.

___
**BASIC WEDDING GUEST ATTIRE**

*If you're completely clueless at dressing yourself and you want to follow very specific rules concerning your outfit follow these guidelines to form something competent and presentable.* 

___
**Wear your smartest/nicest outfit in simple colors and limited patterns.**

Wear what you already own (or at least what's passable). All clothing should fit properly, be in good condition, be washed and ironed. DON'T buy something brand new to impress people unless you WANT to buy something or you NEED to buy something. Remember, nobody is too concerned with what you're wearing anyways, wedding days revolve around the happy couple.

**Attire #1:** *Wear this if possible*

[*A short album #1*](http://imgur.com/a/DSvui)

* **Suit** - Solid navy and gray are the safest colors, try to avoid black or pinstripes.
* **Shirt** - White or light blue dress shirt - point collar, barrel or french cuffs.
* **Shoes** - Black dress shoes and belt, brown is acceptable. Cap-toes or semi brogues preferred. 
* **Tie** - Silk tie with texture, repeating motif, or simple pattern such as stripes, pindots, checks. Avoid solid satin, gaudy colors, and kitschy patterns (like repeating boats or cats). 
* **Pocket square** - *optional* - white linen in a simple TV fold is safest. DON'T wear a matching tie and pocket square set.

**Alternate attire #2:** *Assuming you don't have access to a suit* 

[*A short album #2*](http://imgur.com/a/9eQv6)

* **Jacket** - Navy blazer - wool is preferable, cotton is acceptable.
* **Pants** - Khaki or gray dress pants, wool is preferable over cotton.
* **Shirt** - White or light blue button-up shirt - point collar or button down, barrel cuffs.
* **Shoes** - Black or brown dress shoes and belt. Brogues and loafers are acceptable.
* **Tie** - Silk tie with simple pattern or texture. Stripes, checks, pin-dots are good.

*If you're a bit more accomplished at dressing yourself and want to select something appropriate but individualized, ask yourself the following questions to help pinpoint what you might wear.* 

I get it, you want to wear something to showcase your new talents at dressing but you're not exactly sure how to create the perfect outfit. As you're thinking about your clothing, you should be considering the wedding that you're attending and the guests in attendance. Dress for your specific situation.

**How formal is the wedding? What is the stated dress code?**

Most weddings will have guidelines for a dress code in the invitation or they will imply somehow to the formality of the occasion. Your job is to dress appropriately to match what the bride and groom specify, even if it's not directly stated. If you don't know what the dress code is ASK SOMEONE WHO KNOWS THE BRIDE OR GROOM. They'll be happy to tell you what, if any, the dress code stipulates. ALWAYS FOLLOW THE DRESS CODE, even if it's something like tuxedos during the daytime or aloha shirts in a landlocked state, it's their wedding day, not yours. 

More formal attire includes more conservative color choices with suiting and shirting, proper dress shoes and a [wedding tie](http://i.imgur.com/emVyukY.jpg). Less formal attire includes opting for a jacket over a suit, more casual fabrics, colors in your shirt and tie, and casual leather shoes such as bucs, brogues, or mocassin styles. 

**When is the wedding? What time of day and what season?**

Nighttime weddings are generally more formal than daytime affairs and they're better for darker color palettes. Tuxedos should ONLY be considered for evening events (6:00 pm or sunset whichever comes first), and that's only if the dress code allows them. DO NOT WEAR A TUXEDO DURING A DAYTIME WEDDING. Daytime ceremonies suggest less formal outfits and brighter colors for both suits and accessories. Tan and light gray suits are much easier to wear in daylight. For weddings that begin in the daytime and end at nighttime, don't worry too much about outfit changes, you might consider bringing an extra layer for warmth.

Use the season to dictate your color choices and your material choices. Pay attention to the local weather forecast so you can dress for proper conditions and temperatures. Heavy fabrics such as tweed and flannel are better in fall/winter whereas tropical weight wool, linen, or seersucker are best in the summer. Seasonal footwear can help distinguish your outfit from other guests with dress boots in winter or bucks/loafers in the summer.  Color changes in our environment are great indicators of the color palettes you might consider. Basic seasonal colors are as follows: 

* [Spring](http://i.imgur.com/9cRw42h.jpg) = pastels, pinks, light blues, light yellows
* [Summer](http://i.imgur.com/eHuvOtn.jpg) = bright colors, oranges, reds, blues
* [Fall](http://i.imgur.com/7Flycj8.jpg) = earth tones, fall colors, browns
* [Winter](http://i.imgur.com/9RvRxMl.jpg) = deep colors, burgundy, dark green, plum

**Where is the wedding located? Geographic location? Venue locations?**

Geographic location plays a large role in determining acceptable outfits due to changes in climate, culture, and people.   Texas is known for cowboy boots and decorative belts, New England is preppy, and large cities may have more forward thinking styles. If you're travelling to a region with different style than your own you have three options: 

* Dress in your own style - Where you come from is who you are, no need to change. Wear that seersucker suit on the west coast or that bolo tie in New York. Your family/friends would expect nothing less. 
* Dress in the style of the wedding's location - If you've always wanted to experiment with a style not popular in your region, this is the perfect opportunity. This should be kept within reason of course, don't wear a costume and keep it in good taste.
* Dress in a conservative, traditional style regardless of location - This option is the safest and likely where most wedding guests will end up. There's nothing wrong with a man in a uniform (read: navy or gray suit and wedding tie).

Weddings are often planned around their venues. Grand hotels are more formal than small banquets which are more formal than outdoor picnics. Indoor weddings tend to be more formal that outdoors.  However, don't assume that *all* outdoor weddings are strictly casual. Try to imagine the venue you're headed to and what the typical attendee might be wearing. For example a wedding near the ocean could be interpreted as nautical-themed, whereas a wedding on a farm might be more workwear. I'm not advising you to wear a costume such as denim overalls to a farm wedding, but you might be more inclined to wear flannel or boots. 

Selecting footwear is also related to practicality. You don't want to be wearing leather soled shoes to walk on wet-grass and you might not want dress boots if you're in a standing on a beach.

1370799815.0,543,self.malefashionadvice,1fzoj1,Misconceptions on raw denim,723,180,330,http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/1fzoj1/misconceptions_on_raw_denim/,"I see a lot of misinformation and confusion on here when it comes to raw denim, so I thought it would be good to clear things up.

First, what is raw denim? From Wikipedia:
&gt;Dry or raw denim, as opposed to washed denim, is a denim fabric that is not washed after being dyed during its production.

The end. That's it.

* * *

**Raw denim is not necessarily selvage**

For example, [Levi's 501 STF](http://us.levi.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2076855) are not selvage but are raw. Conversely, selvage jeans can come in various washes ([1](http://www.bonobos.com/premium-selvage-denim-for-men-saltwater-dark-wash) [2](http://www.jcrew.com/mens_category/pants/Denim/PRDOVR~38651/38651.jsp)) as well as raw.

Why are the two confused? Because way back in the day all jeans were selvage, raw, and unsanforized. Reproduction brands who create vintage or pseudo-vintage denim, hence tend use raw selvedge denim.

**Raw denim will not necessarily shrink to fit**

Raw denim can come sanforized or unsanforized. Sanforized is a fancy way of saying that your denim is pre-shrunk, and whether this is a desired trait is up to you. All denim will stretch with wear ~~, but unsanforized denim will stretch more so people typically size down with unsanforized denim~~. 

**Raw denim is not heavier weight than washed denim**

Raw denim comes in all sorts of weights, from lightweight 9 oz to comically thick 22+ oz. I can't think of a washed denim off the top of my head in a 22+ oz weight, but there's no reason it couldn't exist. However, plenty of washed denim, especially work denim, comes in heavier weights like 15 oz.

Whether heavy weight denim is good or bad is a different story, and mainly depends on your climate.

**Raw denim does not look cleaner/more minimal than washed denim**

I think when you say washed denim, people automatically imagine True Religion or Diesel. I often see raw denim recommended for a clean cut look, like pairing it with a blazer, but I think this is a mistake. Yes, raw denim looks very clean and minimal at [first](http://www.highsnobiety.com/files/2012/11/a-beginners-guide-to-raw-denim-2.jpg), but will quickly lose that clean slate look because of the [rapid fading](http://www.highsnobiety.com/files/2012/11/a-beginners-guide-to-raw-denim-3.jpg).

You can buy denim in a [dark wash](http://www.bonobos.com/dark-rinse-slim-straight-leg-denim-for-men-flatiron) which will not fade as fast as raw denim, and will maintain the clean slate look that many people want.

**Raw denim does not mean higher quality**

Quality can be a very fuzzy thing to talk about. It's important to remember that if you're spending $200 on raw denim and using quality to justify it, the quality comes from the fact that they're $200 jeans, not that they're raw. For example, $50 Old Navy jeans vs $50 Gap 1969 raw denim, and $200 Adriano Goldschmieds vs $200 APCs is a valid comparison. $50 Old Navy vs $200 APCs is not.

**Raw denim does not imply a better cut or fit**

I feel like this should be obvious, but the way a pair of jeans is shaped has nothing to do with it's wash.

**Raw denim does not mean 100% cotton**

I've seen raw denim with elastane and kevlar blended into it, although I have no experience with them. I would be curious to see how the elastane blends are, since raw denim normally comes quite rigid, and I personally find stretch denim to be more comfortable.

* * *

This is not meant to imply raw denim is bad, but I see raw denim recommended on here far more often than I think it deserves, for many of the above reasons.

So what are the benefits of raw denim? Basically, if you are interested in:

* [High contrast fading](http://denimhunters.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/P1010701.jpg)
* You like the history and authenticity of raw denim

Now, if you happen to like the cut of Samurais or the weight of 25 oz denim and it just happens to be raw, whatever, I'm not saying to not get them. Many excellent denim brands do happen to only  produce raw jeans, but recommending Samurais because of their cut and denim quality is a different conversation than recommending them because they're raw.

Also, for the regulars: how to improve MFA.",935,399,325,http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/pm1oc/contrary_to_popular_belief_mfa_isnt_full_of/,"MFA is malefashion**advice**. 

* To the new guys:

We're basically giving you a 'basic training' version of how to look presentable . Timex, Clarks, Oxford collared button downs, Levi's 514s, etc., are all there to transition you from your graphic-tees-and-my-pants-look-like-dog-shit look to I-can-take-care-of-myself upgrade. There isn't a uniform as much as their is a guide. Yes, 'everyone' here wears 511s/514s, boots, OCBDs, and Timex but it looks good, so why complain?

The moment you can branch out to that crazy watch, or random silk shirt, or cashmere pants is the moment that you understand the basics of fit, color matching, and pretty much gain a fashion sense.

* To the regulars and to the guys who hate MFA (this goes hand-in-hand):

First, the problem is a lot of people (many of the regulars) firmly believe in the 'MFA uniform'. Every watch that isn't a Timex/Seiko/Citizen is shot down because they're fashionable. Every boot that doesn't look like Wolverines/RedWings/Clarks get shot down because you can get alternatives. It's quite obnoxious, actually, to praise someone for wearing a Timex (which, in my opinion, are boring) but flame someone for wearing Invicta/Fossil/Diesel. And when I say flame, I mean, **flame**. Not criticize, but (passively) insult the person for straying away from the 'uniform'. You guys have to get out of that mindset.

There's a line between 'sticking to the basics' and 'going out and experiment'. MFA is very strict about that line, and it seems like every time someone gets close to it, they go apeshit and say, ""NO NO! DON'T GO THERE! STAY WITH US WHERE IT IS SAFE!"" 

That is one of the biggest reasons why some people hate MFA-- their fear of risk and want to experiment. Sure, we have people like Veroz who goes out and does it anyway, but he's just one guy. The sad thing is, if more people did that, MFA would just accuse them of trying to be Veroz (happened to me, actually). So many people are so afraid of criticism that they end up sticking with the basics and just fill their whole fashion world with the ""MFA basic training uniform"".

**TL;DR**:  Let people experiment, and don't shoot down individual pieces. I would rather hear, ""That outfit doesn't work."" than ""That watch is ugly."" because, who knows, maybe that 'ugly' watch works perfectly with that outfit.


**UPDATE**: I love how the highest voted comment has nothing to do with the post itself, and is actually just some guy who pointed out that, yes, sometimes I'm an asshole. 


**UPDATE#2**: I've never actually seen a thread explode like this in MFA. I hope a lot of the people who usually don't post spoke up against or with the subject. I'm glad that it sparked the discussion, and I hope that (for at least the next couple of days) MFA would be better. I know I'm an asshole and I'm sorry for being so aggressive, but that's the way I am. Not gonna change that for a bunch of faggot hipster retards.

That was a joke. (;

**UPDATE#3**: Well it's morning and I was hoping it would die down through the night but this is still up here. I was on the IRC and a certain someone was pretty much lecturing me on how stupid/useless/etc this thread was. Not sure if he's right, because from the comments that I got, people are glad that I said something. Some people are resubscribing, and some have decided to be more vocal. Some have called out to others to start acting with reddiquette (ie, using downvotes correctly) and be more willing to give criticism without fear of the downvotes. I'm glad you guys spoke up, and hope MFA becomes nicer or at least more productive.",,False,self,t5_2r65t,True,,,True,t3_pm1oc,http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/pm1oc/contrary_to_popular_belief_mfa_isnt_full_of/,

I've normally just been a T-shirt and jeans kind of guy and while I don't think I dress poorly, I just haven't cared all that much about it.

I've always seen dressing up (which for me means anything with a collar) as very fake and constructed.  You create an image of how you want the world to perceive you on a superficial level.  Personally, I always feel fake when I wear them, like I'm a kid dressing up in my dad's suit.  

Now, obviously you need to dress up for certain events and occasions and knowing how to do it well is a good idea, but why put it in the effort every day?  Why does it matter to you?

Personally, I thing that a big element of it is just to try and be more attractive to women (or men) and to get some kind of self-confidence boost from either them finding you attractive, or you finding yourself attractive.  Isn't this just vanity?  Why not just use clothes for the purpose they were created, as a tool to keep you protected from the weather.

Basically what I'm asking is, what convinced you that all this effort of buying the right clothes that work together, making sure they fit, arranging them correctly, and so on is worth it?  Why do you care?

To that end, we're introducing a few broad rules to keep in mind when posting an inspiration album.

- Albums should be **self-post only**
    
- Minimum 25 images
    
- The post should include a few sentences describing the theme or motivation as a starting point for discussion.

We aren't interested in restricting content in any way - do one on any subject, person, piece or style as you see fit. We just hope to see a bit more coherence and beneficial conversation resulting from these posts. After all, this is an advice forum, and while we interpret that very broadly, we don't want MFA to degenerate into an endless stream of reblogged images (that's what tumblr is for).

I understand why many people love raw denim. The quality, the way it feels, and the ability to truly personalize it are unique and can be very cool. But I feel like too often on MFA, it's assumed to be the best - or only - option for denim. Daeus07 said, regarding pre-distressing, in his [fantastic denim guide in the sidebar](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/gtbv4/a_notsoquick_denim_guide/):

&gt; It is almost always far preferable to buy raw jeans and fade them yourself, as factory fading will not line up with the way the denim creases when you move.

While I agree you should be wary of most pre-distressing, I disagree that raw denim is preferable for almost everyone. I think it's really more of a niche product. Most people, even those who care about their style, probably think raw denim is too much of a headache or just don't see the appeal. My goal isn't to bash raw denim, merely to provide information that isn't as readily available on MFA. 

Daeus07 focused primarily on raw denim, especially with brand recommendations. He did an excellent job discussing elements like construction, terminology, fit, and general tips, so I'm going to focus on recommendations for washed denim and trying to fill in any other gaps.

**Washes**

Besides fit, the wash is what defines a pair of jeans. Here are two basic ""guides"" just to give you an idea of the variety out there: [Primer](http://www.primermagazine.com/2008/learn/the-denim-dictionary-washes) and [Topman](http://us.topman.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/CatalogNavigationSearchResultCmd?catalogId=33056&amp;storeId=12555&amp;langId=-1&amp;viewAllFlag=false&amp;sort_field=Relevance&amp;categoryId=670339&amp;parent_categoryId=207368&amp;beginIndex=1&amp;pageSize=20&amp;interstitial=true&amp;geoip=noredirect). A trip to the [Levi's website](http://us.levi.com/family/index.jsp?categoryId=3699943&amp;cp=3146842.3146845&amp;ab=leftnav:men:bystyle:shopothercategories:jeans(seeallmens) is also an easy way to see a variety of washes. 

You may have heard some terms thrown around to describe certain washes or techniques - ""stonewashed"", ""acid-washed"", all the not-at-all descriptive names Levi's uses, etc. - and while the first two describe real washing techniques, terminology is far less important than how a wash actually looks. One term you should keep in mind is ""pre-distressed"", which refers to jeans being damaged/faded in the factory, usually to make them appear aged or weathered. Jeans that are not pre-distressed, but are washed, will have and usually maintain a fairly uniform color throughout. Depending on the color and shade, non-distressed jeans can - but not always - be dressed up to an extent, while distressed (in-factory or by you) jeans cannot.

Now, let's talk about specific washes. I'll use Levi's for the examples, not because they're the only option, but because they're ubiquitous (in the US) and have a large variety.

This - [Levi's](http://us.levi.com/product/index.jsp?productId=11694071&amp;&amp;cp=3146842.3146854.11326986) [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/1U3Lr.jpg) - is a basic, dark indigo, non-distressed wash. It offers the clean, versatile, classic look of raw denim without the raw denim part. For anyone who doesn't want to go down the raw denim road, jeans in this wash should probably make up the majority of the jeans they own.

This - [Levi's](http://us.levi.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2076854&amp;page=3&amp;&amp;cp=3146842.3146845.3699943.17320296) [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/JDApo.jpg) - is a medium to light wash, but it isn't distressed. Jeans in this wash can very easily become ""dad jeans"", a pejorative term that refers to ill-fitting, light-colored jeans that are the typical uniform of the suburban middle-aged. However, they can work, provided they fit well and the rest of your outfit is on point and harmonious. In Americana/workwear styles, I often prefer medium-wash jeans over dark-wash ones. I have similar feelings on this wash: [Levi's](http://us.levi.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2116236&amp;page=3&amp;&amp;cp=3146842.3146845.3699943.17320296) [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/cIX7b.jpg)

These - [Levi's](http://us.levi.com/product/index.jsp?productId=11587058&amp;&amp;cp=3146842.3146854.3691990&amp;fbn=11587058|null|null) [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/k4hFv.jpg) [Levi's](http://us.levi.com/product/index.jsp?productId=12292954&amp;page=3&amp;&amp;cp=3146842.3146845.3699943.17320296&amp;fbn=12292954|null|null) [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/Dxb2v.jpg) [Levi's](http://us.levi.com/product/index.jsp?productId=12905912&amp;cp=3146842.3146845.3699943.17320296&amp;fbn=12905912%7Cnull%7Cnull&amp;clickid=prdsw) [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/ATMLE.jpg) [Levi's](http://us.levi.com/product/index.jsp?productId=12903324&amp;cp=3146842.3146845.3699943.17320086&amp;fbn=12903324%7Cnull%7Cnull&amp;clickid=prdsw) [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/FN7h8.jpg) - are examples of what I find to be bad distressing. It's either overdone or just unattractive. Most jeans sold right now fall into this category. Well-fitting jeans in washes like these will still generally look better than ill-fitting jeans in more attractive washes, but I would avoid them unless you really feel they fit your aesthetic or you love how they look.

These - [Levi's](http://us.levi.com/product/index.jsp?productId=11587057&amp;cp=3146842.3146854.3691990&amp;fbn=12905921|null|null&amp;clickid=prdsw&amp;fbn=11587057|null|null) [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/eg5uv.jpg) [Levi's](http://us.levi.com/product/index.jsp?productId=12330249&amp;page=2&amp;&amp;cp=3146842.3146845.3699943.17320086) [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/gP2fd.jpg) - are examples of the two types of pre-distressing that I like the best. The first type is minimal, non-invasive distressing on an otherwise dark wash. Wearing these casually, you'll probably look like every other guy who looks ""fine"". In some streetwear fits, I think this kind of distressing looks better than a uniformly dark wash. The second type is jeans that are so light that the distressing fits well and doesn't draw as much attention. As a part of slouchy or grungy looks, - think /u/superhomme and /u/milky_funk - these can look fantastic, especially after some real wear and tear. [**/u/_beacon with an excellent post/inspiration album for light wash denim.**](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/1azxxy/light_wash_denim_a_history_and_collection_of/)

There are, of course, many other washes, including colors. Grey or black denim is fairly easy to incorporate for most people and can even look okay slightly distressed. For colors beyond those two, I would stick to non-distressed and only wear them casually. Check out all [these](http://i.imgur.com/FUeds.jpg) Levi's 501 Shrink-to-fit colors and the accompanying [comments](http://i.imgur.com/FUeds.jpg) for inspiration.

**Brand recommendations**

I'm modelling this off the same section in Daeus07's guide. The price ranges, for the most part, are much lower than for raw denim. I don't generally suggest paying $10 for very low-quality jeans, but if it makes sense for you, [the option is available](http://www.walmart.com/ip/11037736?adid=22222222227000046673&amp;wmlspartner=wlpa&amp;wl0=&amp;wl1=g&amp;wl2=&amp;wl3=21486607510&amp;wl4=&amp;wl5=pla&amp;veh=sem). Also, it's worth noting, unlike with raw denim, washed denim is available at basically every clothing store anywhere. [$30 Kohl's jeans](http://www.kohls.com/product/prd-514447/sonoma-lifestyle-straight-leg-jeans.jsp) can't hold a candle to $30 (on sale) Levi's, but they're there. The brands I'm including here are all ones I consider good value at their respective price points.

*Super low end tier (&lt;$25)*

* Old Navy's slim fit jeans fit surprisingly well. I'm 5'9"" 130, and they fit a little more snugly above the knee than 511s with a bit less taper (both size 29). I don't wear them often enough to really evaluate their durability, but quality seems good, a little better than typical Old Navy. [Link.](http://oldnavy.gap.com/browse/product.do?cid=55506&amp;vid=1&amp;pid=776324002) The ""dark rigid"" wash falls into the first category listed above and is a good choice (it's what I own), while the distressing on the ""medium wash"" looks acceptably subtle. [**Link**](http://www.oldnavy.com/products/mens-jeans.jsp)

* Lee is good quality for the money, in my opinion. I know Shujin's brand caution list and general MFA opinion disagrees, but with every pair of Lees I've had, I've been impressed by the quality of the denim and construction. Their downfall is their generally terrible fits and washes. If you're a bigger guy, their regular fit is a bit snugger than the Levi's 501 I've found and would be a solid option. It comes in a huge variety of washes, some of which aren't bad at all. They have some slim fits, closer to a 513 or 514 than 511, but the washes are usually pretty bad. If you find one you like and are more of a 514 guy in terms of fit, I think it's great value. [**Link**](http://www.lee.com/store/LEE_STORE_US/en_US/category/men/jeans.html)

*Mid-tier ($25-$50)*

* Uniqlo - ~~Denim is Chinese, like Levi's.~~ Denim is actually Japanese (thanks Cameronrgr). Like Levi's, higher quality than almost every other ""basic"" brand of jeans. Cuts and washes are among the best. (There are also their Made in Japan raw jeans.) [**Link**](http://www.uniqlo.com/us/mens-clothing/mens-bottoms/mens-jeans)

* H&amp;M - Along with their outerwear, denim is one of the few things at H&amp;M that's pretty good quality. Like Uniqlo, the cuts and washes are excellent (for those of average to well below-average size) but the quality is worse. I would only take H&amp;M denim over Uniqlo if it was a) more convenient or b) Uniqlo's slimmest cut wasn't slim enough for me, which is a somewhat common complaint. If you have that complaint at H&amp;M, I don't know how your body is still alive. [**Link**](http://www.hm.com/us/subdepartment/MEN?Nr=4294956231)

* Zara and value/quality rarely go together, but some people swear by their jeans. Some of the washes and cuts look great to me. [**Link**](http://www.zara.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/category/uk/en/zara-neu-W2012-s/317588/Jeans)

*Levi's tier (mostly $35-$60)*

* You knew it was coming. Levi's is the name of the game in washed denim. You will find a cut that flatters you - 511 for slim people, 513/514 for average people, and 508/501 for people with big legs covers 90%, in my opinion - and you will find a wash that you like. One issue with Levi's is possible quality variance, discussed [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/12wwrh/levis_quality_variance_could_it_be_true/c6yyllx) and [here](http://i.imgur.com/qui7z.png). It's cliched at this point, but Levi's is probably the best value in denim (raw notwithstanding) as long as you're not limited to the super low-end or interested in exceptional quality. [**Link**](http://us.levi.com/family/index.jsp?categoryId=3699943&amp;cp=3146842.3146845&amp;ab=leftnav:shopothercategories:jeans(seeallmens):3699943)

*I don't like Levi's for some reason (or I'm European and they're super expensive; sorry!) tier ($60-$100)*

* I've had good experiences with Gap denim ($60-$80). A variety of fits and washes, some of which are quite good (the skinny and slim fit). I imagine the denim is Levi's quality at best, probably a bit worse, but if you prefer the fit and available washes and you catch it on sale, it's a good option. I know it might pain denim enthusiasts to see people spending as much as they would on a pair of Unbranded jeans on a pair of average-quality washed jeans, though. [**Link**](http://www.gap.com/products/mens-jeans.jsp)

* Twitchshooter put in a good word for J. Crew denim. Variety of good cuts, good quality. [**Link**](http://www.jcrew.com/mens_category/denim.jsp)

*I care a lot about denim but apparently not raw denim tier (&gt;$100)*

At this point, we're well back to niche product status. The average person doesn't care about these jeans any more than they do raw jeans, which is to say, not at all. Unlike with raw denim, it's tough to determine whether you're paying more for better quality. It's usually not that you're just paying for the name, but I would have to really be in love with a fit, wash, or certain details to shell out this kind of money for washed denim. 

* Levi's Vintage Clothing has a lot of unique reproductions that are great quality. Some raw, some washed. Absolutely worth the money. [**Link**](http://www.levisvintageclothing.com/collection.php)

* Acne is more on the high-fashion side of things. They have a great skinny fit, minimalist detailing, and some unique wash options, some terrible, some not. [**Link**](http://shop.acnestudios.com/shop/men/jeans-1.html)

* RRL, a high-end Ralph Lauren brand, has some great jeans, raw and washed. They're one of the only brands I've seen that has made good-looking jeans with over-the-top distressing. [**Link**](http://www.ralphlauren.com/shop/index.jsp?categoryId=11757743)

* Simon Miller is a designer whose jeans I've only seen at Barney's. Made in the US, high quality, and some distressing that I actually really like. [**Link**](http://www.simonmillerusa.com/collection-en.html)

* Nudie (suggested by Cameronrgr) is best known on MFA for its raw denim, but it has many washed options (some selvedge, some distressed) and just as many fits as Levi's. Its raw denim is known to be less durable than many of its competitors but I don't know how its washed denim stacks up. [**Link**](http://shop.nudiejeans.com/en/1/jeans)

* J Brand

* Givenchy

* Rag &amp; Bone

* Burberry (primarily Brit and London lines; thanks Iampresto)

* Neighborhood (suggested by Cameronrgr)

* Visvim (suggested by Cameronrgr)

* Dior (suggested by Cameronrgr)

* Evisu (courtesy of Nasi_lemak)

* G-Star (courtesy of Nasi_lemak)

* Robert Geller (courtesy of Superhomme)

* Japanese brands (courtesy of Superhomme): Nonnative, Hysteric Glamour, Uniform Experiment, Sophnet, Wtaps.

* Other brands known for pre-washed denim (varying quality) (big thanks to Iampresto): Hudson, 3x1, The Rising Sun, AG, Earnest Sewn, Dolce and Gabbana, DSQUARED2, Citizens of Humanity, John Varvatos, 7 for all Mankind, True Religion, Deisel, PRPS, Fidelity, Joe's, 34 Heritage, Paige, Lucky, Cult of Individuality, Buffalo, Mavi

I could continue to list brands, but there are so many that all have different appeal (many more have been added by request). I recommend looking through the high end brands listed in Daeus07's guide and checking out the washed options of the ones that have them.

**Final note**

Think of this as a small supplement to [Daeus07's guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/gtbv4/a_notsoquick_denim_guide/). He covered nearly everything about denim, while this just looks at one sliver of it. If you're not interested in raw jeans, I would still re-read his guide, especially for his thoughts on fit, all the links to resources, and other general tips. I hope this guide can be helpful and I appreciate any feedback.

***Edit: Goddamn, there's a lot of fear and loathing down in the comments.  They're shorts and polos, guys - they don't have to define your entire personality.***


 * [Lands' End suede boat shoes](http://canvas.landsend.com/pp/mens-kinsey-classic-boat-shoe~219685_-1.html?bcc=y&amp;action=order_more&amp;sku_0=::CLN&amp;CM_MERCH=IDX_sale-_-men-_-shoes-accessories&amp;origin=index), $29.97 and free shipping with code SWIMHQ1 (pin 2512).  Get 'em in tan if you want something versatile and safe, red or orange if you want something bolder (but less versatile).  Stay away from black - it's a terrible choice for casual footwear, especially in the summer.  The navy boat shoes are almost sold out, unfortunately, but there are most sizes still available in the other colors.  For something more sneaker-ey, [these Sperry-CVO-knockoffs](http://canvas.landsend.com/pp/StylePage-393321_X5.html?amp;CM_MERCH=REC-_-CVPP-_-GGT-_-2-_-393321-_-401124) are $21.97, available in tan and navy in a bunch of sizes, and will still qualify you for free shipping.  Put some rawhide leather laces in them to steal a look from the J.Crew summer catalog.  The boat shoes fit true-to-size and the sneakers fit 1/2 size big, according to the reviews on the website.  For all the LE stuff, you can return for free at any Sears store that carries LE (which is almost all of them).  Budget in $3 for some Gold Bond powder and wear them sockless.

These aren't the greatest polos in the world, but they're available in a wide range of colors and sizes (including tall sizes).  Mainline Lands' End shirts are cut generously, so size down one.  For reference, I'm 6'2 and 185 lbs, and I wear a medium-tall comfortably.  [Tailored fit is here](https://canvas.landsend.com/pp/mens-tailored-short-sleeve-original-banded-mesh-polo-shirt~229211_-1.html?bcc=y&amp;action=order_more&amp;sku_0=::HNB&amp;CM_MERCH=search-_-401625&amp;origin=search), but (1) some of the colors are $12.97, and (2) they don't come in tall sizes.  As an alternative (since the updated LE code doesn't have a minimum order anymore), [these Old Navy slim-fit polos](http://oldnavy.gap.com/browse/product.do?cid=26068&amp;vid=1&amp;pid=898381) are $9, come in tall sizes, and a wide range of colors.  From comments in a previous thread, they're not great quality and run very long through the body.  They're also a 60/40 cotton-poly blend.  Either way, whether it's LE or ON, I recommend getting one in a dark color (charcoal or dark olive), one in the red/yellow family, and one in the blue/green family.  Figure out what colors would work best with the shorts you're ordering below.  Don't order a blue polo and blue shorts, for example, or red and red.  For a starter kit, you'll want to make sure you can wear everything interchangeably with everything else.  There's a color-matching guide in the sidebar if you need it.

I'd get one pair in khaki and one pair in either blue or red (but see my note about colors above - make sure you're buying a versatile kit where everything is interchangeable with everything else).  I wasn't sure how these fit, so I live-chatted with Norma from LL Bean, Paula from Lands' End Canvas and Hector from J.Crew to get some measurements for comparison.  For a size 32 pair of 9"" inseam shorts, these LL Beans have a 34"" waist measurement and 23 3/8"" leg opening.  For comparison in the same tagged size, the [Lands' End Canvas 9"" shorts](http://canvas.landsend.com/pp/mens-everyday-chino-shorts~235391_-1.html?bcc=y&amp;action=order_more&amp;sku_0=::JA1&amp;CM_MERCH=IDX_men-_-pants-shorts-_-shorts&amp;origin=index) have a 33.5"" waist and 22.5"" leg opening and the [J.Crew 9"" broken-in chino shorts](http://www.jcrew.com/mens_category/shorts/brokeninchinoshorts/PRDOVR~67140/67140.jsp) have a 33.75"" waist and 23"" leg opening.  Again, those measurements are all for size 32 shorts.  Waist measurements will go up/down by about an inch per size, and leg openings will probably change by 1/4-1/2"".

***As always, if you don't like the style, the colors, or whatever, you should put together your own $100 kit and post it.  If it's too frat-douche or too New England preppy or too dad-ish or too grandpa-ish or too hipster or too colorful or too plain or too something else, this is your official invitation to make a better one.  I don't have any special skills at this - it's mostly just waiting for sales on basics to align.  It would be great to see more people doing these, in my opinion.***

1373485257.0,503,self.malefashionadvice,1i11f1,Style Guide: Silhouette,649,146,110,http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/1i11f1/style_guide_silhouette/,"I wanted to start a discussion and provide some resource on the topic of *silhouette.* Let's jump right in.

**What is silhouette?**

Silhouette is a French term and, from Wikipedia, ""is the image of a person, an object or scene represented as a solid shape of a single colour, usually black, its edges matching the outline of the subject... Because a silhouette emphasises the outline, the word has also been used in the fields of fashion and fitness to describe the shape of a person's body or the shape created by wearing clothing of a particular style or period.""

Pretty simple. But it's one of the most fundamental aspects of fashion and something you should be aware of when putting together an outfit. Fit is how a piece of clothing fits your body, while silhouette is the overall shape that your outfit takes. You can use radically different fits but still achieve similar silhouettes.

[This image](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Coronet_Corset_Co.gif) from Wikipedia shows how the exact same outfit can be changed in a pretty big way just by altering the silhouette.

**Why should I care about my silhouette?**

Your silhouette is what you would see if you took the color, texture, and other details out of your outfit. It's a fundamental part of your overall look. It's also one of the most fun things to play around with.

**Can you please just tell me how to have a good silhouette?**

It's not that simple, but I'll try. If you're only interested in exploring silhouettes, you can skip this section. If you want me to tell you how to apply silhouttes to modern menswear, or want a basic introduction of how silhouettes are applied fashion, read on.

I have taken four fits (black tie, formal, business casual and casual) and blacked out the models. Look at these four images first and compare them (don't browse the rest of the album quite yet.) [one](http://i.imgur.com/74pJhQf.jpg), [two](http://i.imgur.com/eNahJK5.jpg), [three](http://i.imgur.com/X2mAf4X.jpg), and [four](http://i.imgur.com/vfdlZt3.jpg). Can you figure out which is which? Which one do you like best?

[Here](http://imgur.com/eNahJK5,74pJhQf,X2mAf4X,vfdlZt3,apZUE4u,cXByce9,dduO9Vx,W4MZSYH) is an album with the four silhouettes you just saw and the original images. Are you surprised by any of the fits? Did you like one outfit in the silhouette but change your mind when you saw the real thing? How about the other way around? What specifically did you like or dislike about the silhouettes? Let's take a closer look at each of the fits.

*Note: Do not underestimate the value of blacking out a fit as a tool to help you critique fits and develop your style.*

* [Black tie](http://imgur.com/vfdlZt3,W4MZSYH)

Look at the blacked out picture. If you frequently wear suits, take note here. This is the shape that suits and tuxedos have taken on for as long as they have been around but especially 20th and 21st centuries (we don't like to talk about the 70s or 90s though.) I am hoping that the black tie image was hard to tell apart from the formal image (I think the bag probably gave it away) because the silhouette for the two styles is almost exactly the same. Take note of how the fit flatters his body. The jacket makes his shoulders look broad, the waist makes him look slim, the collar provides a nice transition to his head. If you could see his shoes (oxfords or slippers for black tie) you would see that they provide a sleek look to his feet and the pants would taper down slightly, giving a nice clean line from hips to feet. There is a reason formalwear and suits have not changed much in the 20th century, and the silhouette has a lot to do with it.

When you look at the real picture, there are no real surprises. The colors and textures help accentuate certain aspects of the fit, but there's not much else going on that you couldn't see before.

* [Formal](http://imgur.com/eNahJK5,dduO9Vx)

Look at the blacked out picture. There's not much new here. It's a bit of a slimmer cut, but I don't think it would be out of place at a black tie event or vice versa. You may want to think about how the bag changes his silhouette and adds a large shape as well as affecting his posture.

When you go to the real picture, suddenly there's a lot more going on. The color, the texture, all the pieces are working in different ways than in black tie. This is all covered in other guides on the sidebar ([Here is the suit guide.](http://redd.it/e96hr)) But the silhouette is largely the same. The biggest difference between a suit and tuxedo is the freedom you have in color and texture. I love the trousers, I'm not a fan of the socks or checked shirt, but you have no idea of these things looking at the silhouette. They don't contribute or detract from the overall shape.

If you only wear suits, you can stop reading here.

* [Business Casual] (http://imgur.com/74pJhQf,cXByce9)

Look at the blacked out picture. Things are getting a little more interesting now. Look at the pockets on his jacket. Look at how much more they bulge out than in the previous two pictures. He doesn't look as svelt as the guys in suits and tuxedos. But it's also obvious that they are big chunky pockets and not just wide hips. Look at how the popped collar leads from the shoulders to the head in a more exaggerated way. But the fit of the shoulders, hips, arms and pants is very similar to the formal fits.

Look at the real picture. Were you surprised by the material of the blazer? That he was wearing a sweater? 

* [Casual](http://imgur.com/X2mAf4X,apZUE4u)

Look at the blacked out picture. This is about as simple as you can get in menswear. The clothing he is wearing is doing almost nothing to alter the shape of his body. You have his shoes making his feet look nice and some stacking in the pants, but other than that he could be naked and you would have no idea. This isn't necessarily *bad,* just take note that he's not changing his silhouette very much.

Look at the real picture. He looks like a regular person, not more svelt like in the black tie fit or more chunky like in the business casual fit. He could be wearing a polo or an OCBD or a light sweater and it would still not really change his overall shape. Again, there is nothing wrong with the fit, I just want you to take note of what a minimalistic silhouette looks like in menswear. Sometimes doing nothing special with a fit is as much of a statement as doing something ridiculous.

**How can I avoid a bad silhouette?**

It's pretty simple, really: wear clothes that fit properly. There are plenty of excellent fit guides on the sidebar. Menswear is designed to have a certain silhouette and if you wear the pieces properly the whole thing should work together. As long as you don't mix a t-shirt with suit pants, you will be sticking with the tried and true shapes of menswear. Just be mindful of your overall shape as you buy new pieces and put together an outfit. You want your silhouette to be flattering and help accent your features.

*OK so that's basically it. I hope you learned some stuff about how your silhouette works with menswear and that you can start to become more aware of it as you develop your style.*

**That's it? I thought we were going to talk about how to explore silhouettes. I want to stand out in my office.**

Sadly, there's not much I can do for you here. You can do a lot to stand out by playing around with color, texture and accessories, but any drastic change in your silhouette and you're not wearing a suit anymore and therefore can't wear it to the office. If you want to stand out in menswear, you're going to have to work with color and texture and leave your silhouette alone. Any example I've seen of someone wearing formal wear with a fresh silhouette is working in an environment where they have freedom to dress how they want and a suit is not required anyway. Nick Wooster does a pretty good job of keeping it business-y I guess, but he mainly plays with color and texture. You can do little things with business casual like chunky sweaters and cuffed chinos, maybe some bulky Doc Martens, but again it depends on how flexible your dress code is. *If anyone has examples of formal wear with cool silhouettes, please feel free to comment and I'll add them.* The bright side to all this is that the silhouette for menswear is very flattering and aesthetically pleasing, and it's very much possible to create interesting fits without touching the standard silhouette.

**OK, thanks for the menswear guide to silhouettes. I am going to leave now.**

Thanks for reading! Good luck with those TPS reports!


**Have the menswear guys left yet? Good.**

The biggest problem with the silhouette in menswear is that it's *boring.* I mean, it's *really boring.* The vast majority of people don't try to experiment with their silhouette as much as they do with color and texture.

**How can I create interesting silhouettes?**

Simple: start to look for them. Start becoming aware of the silhouettes you see online and in real life. Start to think about how you can incorporate the things you like into your style. The idea that your silhouette should flatter and accentuate your body is sound, but it's also just an idea.

I mean, [look at this fit.](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e1/Marcus_Aurelius_at_the_British_Museum.jpg) The way it drapes and and folds? That is so cool. The layering of the fabric, even though it's only one piece? And [look at this amazing style](http://karenswhimsy.com/public-domain-images/renaissance-clothing/images/renaissance-clothing-1.jpg). [Here's more](http://renaissancepoetry0.weebly.com/uploads/1/4/5/7/14575518/3439753_orig.jpg). That cape? The way the pants and skirt or whatever accent the thighs and hips? The slippers? The frilly collar? You don't see that stuff anymore. [How about this one?](http://www.pocanticohills.org/washington/GW1782.jpg) The tailcoat, boots, high waisted pants, that is fantastic. [Or what about these gentlemen?](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-HV7odOZUdrw/TuVxF7mevoI/AAAAAAAAAFI/mEydeImFtEo/s1600/Ancient+Japanese+clothing.jpg) The billowy sleeves and skirt and the sandals, the way it cinches in at the waist. Look at the shoulders on the guy in the center. Just look at them. [Check out this fit.](http://www.africastyles.com/images/mspe/mspe-1020l-new.jpg) Look at the whole rectangle shape andthe way the squared cap completes the fit. [This one is really cool too.](http://store.canyonrecords.com/biopics/William_Horncloud_color.jpg) If I were to black this one out you'd have a hard time telling it was human. [This is a simple one.](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lxzhndiKyp1qipvddo1_500.jpg) Look at how the turban changes the whole shape of the head, notice the asymmetry.

Regardless of how historically accurate those images were, the point is that clothing throughout history has not adhered to the same rules regarding silhouette and shape that are familiar to us today. I am not saying you should go out tomorrow in a toga, what I'm trying to illustrate is that the current silhouette that we are all familiar with as 21st century Westerners is not set in stone. It is a modern adoption and *should* be played around with just as much as color and texture and accessories. There is nothing wrong with not liking a certain style, as long as you realize that all silhouettes are arbitrary on some level. You can say that you have thought critically about the piece and still do not like the aesthetics of the garment, and that is all a part of your own style. *If you do not care to try and push the boundaries of silhouette, you can stick with menswear and that is just fine too.*

That said, let's move on and explore silhouettes in more modern fashion.

**How can I explore silhouettes in modern fashion?**

Learning about silhouettes is the thing that got me interested in designer fashion to begin with. The first thing you have to realize is that (for the most part) fashion designers are not creating outfits that they expect to see you wearing on the street tomorrow. They are demonstrating *ideas* that they hope to see you incorporate into your style tomorrow. 

[Take a look at Yohji Yamamoto.](http://i.imgur.com/rOG67iq.jpg) That outfit is not too ridiculous, right? But look what he's done with the silhouette. Look at how the pants are cuffed above the ankles, but they are loose and billowy, and they end abruptly into combat boots. Look at how much longer the jacket is than a standard blazer, and the whole thing is looser and baggier than the suits we looked at earlier. Yohji is not looking svelt and slim and sleek. He's looking baggy and chunky. [Here's another picture of him.](http://www.egodesign.ca/_files/articles/548d_yohji_yamamoto__zinedine_zidane.jpg) Again, baggy and billowy. Yohji tends to bring some of that ancient Japanese look into his clothing, you see how the billowy silhouettes you just saw reflect the shapes of the Japanese clothing that I linked to earlier.

[I know you've heard of Rick Owens](http://i122.photobucket.com/albums/o250/Handlethevibe/RickOwens-1.jpg). [Here's another](http://blog.needsupply.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/rick6.jpg). [And a third](http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2009/5/6/1241606001804/Rick-Owens-in-Paris-001.jpg). Look at how he plays with a minimalistic top and pairs it with a chunky bottom (first picture), a feminine bottom (second) and a billowy bottom (third). His Geobaskets are famous among sneakerheads precisely because of the chunky silhouette they provide.

I could continue, but there are so many other designers out there. If you are new to designer fashion I would recommend checking out a few shows or collections and just focusing on the silhouettes for now, and how the designer is trying to change things up for better or for worse. Besidees Yohji and Rick you can start with Raf Simons, Ann Demeulemeester, Alexander Wang or Maison Martin Margiela. Remember, you don't have to wear $1,000 shoes to be into designer fashion, you just need to think about what the designer is doing to the outfit and (if you like it) how you can incorporate that idea into your wardrobe. Maybe you decide Geobaskets are really cool, but since you can't afford them you find that Supra makes some stuff that would work for you for a cheaper price. Maybe you like Yohji's billowy pants so you go to Wal-Mart and buy some 5XL trousers and tailor them into your own cool billowy pants. The possibilities are endless once you start looking and exploring.

[Finally, a short album of pictures I have of real peaple that are playing with silhouette (some more than others).](http://imgur.com/a/pANri)

There seems to be a widely-perpetuated adage that white pants should only be worn after Memorial Day, but never after Labor day (For those outside the US, Memorial Day occurs at the end of May and Labor day is early September). There are several reasons for this, many of which are delineated by [Time Magazine](http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1920684,00.html).

**White usually meant lighter fabrics**

&gt;One common explanation is practical. For centuries, wearing white in the summer was simply a way to stay cool — like changing your dinner menu or putting slipcovers on the furniture. ""Not only was there no air-conditioning, but people did not go around in T shirts and halter tops. They wore what we would now consider fairly formal clothes,"" says Judith Martin, better known as etiquette columnist Miss Manners. ""And white is of a lighter weight.""

**White was symbolic for leisure**
&gt;other historians speculate, the origin of the no-white-after–Labor Day rule may be symbolic. In the early 20th century, white was the uniform of choice for Americans well-to-do enough to decamp from their city digs to warmer climes for months at a time: light summer clothing provided a pleasing contrast to drabber urban life. ""If you look at any photograph of any city in America in the 1930s, you'll see people in dark clothes,"" says Scheips, many scurrying to their jobs. By contrast, he adds, the white linen suits and Panama hats at snooty resorts were ""a look of leisure.""       

----
----
However, as early as the 1920s, fashion designers neglected this rule. Coco Chanel was famous for having white pants designed for the winter and other fashion designers have followed suit. Some fairly recent runway appearances of white pants can be seen by [Victor Glemaud](http://imgur.com/8515SYj), [Simon Spurr](http://imgur.com/WMNx8Ep), and [Michael Bastian](http://imgur.com/si54Djc), amongst others. 

White pants are often described as a preppy, warm weather look, as can be seen in this iconic photo of [JFK.](http://imgur.com/SQSDDj3) This is actually not too far off the truth, as white pants can be hard to pull off in other ""styles."" The only other way that I've seen it done frequently is in the hip-hop scene. [Kanye West](http://imgur.com/tf0K6iT) tries it here, for those that are fans of him.

-----
----
**The Look**
 

Although white might seem to be an incredibly versatile color (white tees can go with anything), white pants seem to not be as versatile in terms of color and formality pairings. White pants look best when slim and worn with contrast somewhere else in the outfit. A navy top (either blazer or polo) and brown loafers are perhaps the most classic look, due to its nautical feel and crisp coloring. Examples include [1](http://imgur.com/tf9lSBX), [2](http://imgur.com/TyMUd2y), [3](http://imgur.com/Hqv73Ku), [4](http://imgur.com/ymvwv2O), [5](http://imgur.com/zOWGX55).


**Note**

It is difficult to have nothing dark to contrast with the white pants and still pull them off. Usually, a dark top will suffice, however, dark sunglasses/hair/skin tone can all break up the wall of color if done correctly. This look is not as safe, but still provides sufficient contrast to not seem too washed-out. Notice the subtle navy trim, coupled with a tan skin tone, sunglasses, and dark hair [here](http://imgur.com/bx8D7VK). This [man](http://i.imgur.com/NSx6JW5.jpg), despite wearing rather faint colors, chose a dark tie along with the dark stripe on his panama hat to help balance his outfit, although this is about as minimal in terms of contrast that you should get. Here is an example of someone looking [washed out](http://imgur.com/2V0j697), despite attempting to balance the color with a darker bag and color detailing. For fans of Peter Adrian, he does redeem himself [here](http://imgur.com/7JVqRxg), which a nice navy varsity jacket (Akufuncture, for those wondering). Oh, and please don't wear white [cargo pants](http://imgur.com/Y0gKawB).

**Fabrics**

The three most common fabrics for white pants are linen, cotton (chino/twill), and denim. 
Of these, linen is perhaps the least versatile, seeing as how they are often too transparent, often leading to revealing of undergarments/tucked-in shirts, etc. White chinos are better suited for the summer weather and denim is generally reserved for fall/winter looks, although white denim and white chinos are virtually indistinguishable unless you are up close. 

**Where can I buy white pants?**

The easiest and well-fitting option in my opinion is Levi's 511 or 514 in white, which are available at your local JC Penney for $40 (YMMV).
Other options include:

Banana Republic also has similarly priced slim fit white chinos and APC has higher end ones, similar to Epaulet. If anyone has any other brand suggestions, I would be happy to add them here.

The lack of variety of outfits speaks to how hard they can to do correctly, but I think the ones that do work are worth trying out.

My father didn't know my size so he guessed and he guessed wrong. I live in Kelowna BC, Canada and the nearest Brooks Brothers is ~350km away in Vancouver BC. Because of this factor, I was unable to return the shirts until 2 weeks ago.   
  
When I went into Brooks Brothers, I was immediately greeted by the employees and the ~~owner~~ manager. I told them of my story and that I still had the shirts in the box along with a photocopied receipt. The shirts not only were from the stores fall clothing line (as my Dad bought the shirts well before Christmas) but it was 7 months after the original purchase date (3 month return policy). After a few minutes, the owner decided to let me return the clothes in return for a store gift certificate. I was astonished as it would have been so easy for him to simply of said no as he very well should have.  
  
The sales associate measured me for dress shirts and spent 45 minutes searching the entire store for my rare shirt size. I ended up using the $200 on the gift certificate as well and an additional $70 to buy 3 dress shirts. The entire time, the staff was incredibly polite and kind towards me even though I am only 19 and was wearing a tank top and shorts. After completing the transaction, the associate shook my hand, handed me his card, and thanked me.  
  
Today in the mail I received a hand addressed envelope and card thanking me once again for the shopping at the store and looking forward to meeting me. I have never shopped at BB, so I don't know if this is standard for them, but I was astonished. They have incredible customer service.  
  
*TL;DR* Returned Brooks Brothers discontinued clothes that were 4 months past return policy. Received a full refund, exceptional service, and a thank you card in the mail.  
  
*TL;DR TL;DR* Brooks Brothers is incredible.

I went a slightly different direction this time, and some folks are going to feel uncomfortable with the length of the shorts, the patterns on the shorts, or the style of shoes.  But if you're on the fence, here's a way to try a new summer style with a really, really modest investment.  And how boring would the world be if we all liked the same things?

But once again, here's the deal - although this kit is a little less generic than khaki shorts and tees, nothing here is cutting-edge fashion, it probably doesn't express your personality, and it's not going to immediately turn you into a GQ cover model.  But if you just stumbled into MFA and you've quickly realized that all of your summer clothes are too big and/or terrible, this is a great opportunity to pick up some versatile basics.  Then keep reading, learn what you like and dislike, and develop your own style.  And subscribe to [r/frugalmalefashion.](http://www.reddit.com/r/frugalmalefashion)  

As the title says, I'm going to be away from MFA for a while.  This isn't a ragequit or anything dramatic - my wife and I are having a baby sometime in the next couple weeks.  So even though he's not here yet, I need to spend my time at work wrapping things up before paternity leave instead of redditing.  Writing kits, guides,etc is something I honestly enjoy putting (maybe too much) time and energy into (even if there does seem to be an undercurrent of serious antagonism about what I post - misplaced, in my opinion), so I'll be back - it's just not clear when.  Cheers!

*(Edit: Thanks for the kind words, everyone.  He'll be our second, so we're relaxed veterans this time around (said with the second-time parent's stereotypical naive overconfidence).  For the MFA baby shower, we're registered at Unionmade and Epaulet.)*

Anyway, pull out your wallets - let's do this thing.

____

 * Two pairs of [patterned twill shorts](http://oldnavy.gap.com/browse/product.do?cid=45495&amp;vid=1&amp;pid=115871&amp;scid=115871002), $15 each and [$5 off $25 with this coupon](http://dealspl.us/oldnavy-coupons) (in-store only, but that's fine, because it's worth trying these on first and free shipping from the website doesn't kick in until $50).   The cotton twill fabric keeps them from looking too much like board shorts.  Of the three patterns, I'm a big fan of blue floral and green floral, with hibiscus in distant third.  I don't like the palm trees at all - too close to a board short pattern, in my opinion.  For what it's worth, I also like the [chambray shorts](http://oldnavy.gap.com/browse/product.do?cid=45495&amp;vid=1&amp;pid=897377&amp;scid=897377012) and the [linen camp shorts](http://oldnavy.gap.com/browse/product.do?cid=45495&amp;vid=1&amp;pid=112163&amp;scid=112163012), which are only $12.  These are 8"" inseam shorts, but if you're too tall for that or not confident enough to have skin showing above your knee, they also sell [madras prints](http://oldnavy.gap.com/browse/product.do?cid=45495&amp;vid=1&amp;pid=897377&amp;scid=897377062) in tall sizes (12"" inseams) for the same price.   I think it's worth giving the 8"" inseams a shot, though - at least go try them on.  You're not going to find your own style without experimenting a little bit, right?  (Edit: someone asked about measurements, and here's what I know - a pair in 32 measures 33"" around the waist and 10"" across the legs.  That's sort of a middle ground between skinny and baggy, at least on me.)

 * [Two long-sleeve button-downs in poplin](http://canvas.landsend.com/pp/the-heritage-patterned-poplin~211462_-1.html?bcc=y&amp;action=order_more&amp;sku_0=::CO7&amp;CM_MERCH=IDX_sale-_-men-_-shirts&amp;origin=index), $25 each and free shipping with SUMMERSAVE (pin: 2777).   I mentioned above the the patterned shorts are edging into board short territory, and you avoid that by grounding the shorts with a casual button-down shirt instead of a tank top or t-shirt.  Poplin is a soft, lightweight cotton, and with the sleeves rolled at or above your elbow, these are going to be just as cool as short-sleeve polos or tees.   Lands' End Canvas shirts run a little big, so if you're between sizes, go down.  If you can swing it, order two different sizes and return the one that doesn't fit to any Sears store.    

 * [A pair of espadrilles](http://www.soludos.com/shop-men), $38 shipped.  Espadrilles are a relatively uncommon summer shoe (except for Toms, which are overpriced and [bad aid](http://goodintents.org/in-kind-donations/toms-shoes)), but [Put This On has recommended them a bunch](http://putthison.com/tagged/Espadrilles) (and [in a ""Summer Style on the Cheap"" post here too](http://putthison.com/post/5043780944/the-five-days-of-summer-series-part-v-summer)) so it's hard to call them too feminine.  [The guys at Street Etiquette have also written about espadrilles](http://streetetiquette.com/2010/08/13/summer-etiquette-espadrilles/), and [they've shown up on MFA before too](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/ukbcu/any_thoughts_on_espadrilles/).   [I also put together a quick image gallery of some shots I like.](http://imgur.com/a/Hzttp)  I linked to Soludos espadrilles above because they're pretty cheap and come in a really wide range of colors (although I'd probably stick to the basics - white, off-white, navy or grey, in canvas, linen or chambray).  [RopeySoles make another affordable option](http://ropeysoles.com/mens_product_page.php?item_code=MESimple01) (about $30, including international shipping to the US), and so does [Drilleys](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=sr_nr_n_1?rh=n%3A672123011%2Cp_4%3ADrilleys%2Cn%3A!672124011%2Cn%3A679255011&amp;bbn=672124011&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1340026321&amp;rnid=672124011).  You can even go really cheap with the [$16 espadrilles at Asos](http://us.asos.com/search/espadrilles?hrd=1&amp;q=espadrilles#state=Rf-700%3D1001%40Rf-400%3D53&amp;parentID=-1&amp;pge=1&amp;pgeSize=20&amp;sort=-1) (especially since shipping is free), but I've heard terribly things about Asos-branded footwear and my guess is that you're sacrificing a lot of quality and not saving all that much, compared to Soludos or RopeySoles.  On the other hand, it's easier to experiment with new styles if you're not out much cash when they don't work out.  It's worth noting that very few espadrilles are going to be more than one-season shoes.  In Spain and France (where this type of shoe originated), they were historically shoes you'd buy from a cheap street vendor.  

[Here's a Polyvore image of everything - ](http://www.polyvore.com/cgi/set?id=51200259) - 

**Total: $113 (or $91 with the Asos espadrilles)**

____

***As always, if you don't like the style, the colors, or whatever, you should put together your own $100 kit and post it.***  

***If this one's too frat-douche, too feminine, too preppy, too grandpa-ish, too hipster, too colorful, or too something else, this is your official invitation to make a better one.  I don't have any special skills at this - it's mostly just waiting for sales on basics to align.***  

***There's also always demand for British/Euro kits, but I just don't know the retailers well enough to do it well.  It would be great to see more people doing these, in my opinion.***

(Updated 7/17/13) 

(*Please message me if your image is featured in any of these articles and you would like it removed*)

Since 2006, Goth Ninja has been a cult favorite underground Role Playing Game.  It reached its peak popularity in 2009 and until the writing of this guide everyone on MFA had no idea what the fuck it was and replied ""gothninja, lol"" to every fit pic in all black.

Despite its modicum of popularity on other forums, most MFAers don't understand how to play Goth Ninja, level up, or how the class system works.  I've done some reading but I'm far from being an expert.  You should start with some core Goth Ninja reading from SZ:

* [**Johnny**'s 9 points of Style Philosophy](http://stylezeitgeist.com/forums/showpost.php?p=12344&amp;postcount=22)
* [A big thread on ""Where to Start."" **Fuuma** discusses Finding your Style and **Faust** discusses brands and value](http://stylezeitgeist.com/forums/showthread.php?t=3064)
* [**Faust** on brands, value and quality](http://stylezeitgeist.com/forums/showpost.php?p=3205&amp;postcount=14)
* [**Servo2000**'s post on the authenticity of a fashion item](http://www.stylezeitgeist.com/forums/showpost.php?p=95434&amp;postcount=9093)

One of the things which makes Goth Ninja difficult is intentional obfuscation of the rules - Goth Ninjas are intentionally vague about how the game is played because there is a capped maximum amount of exp that exists in the game at one time.  That means if lower level players level up then higher level players lose exp.  Sharing information about Goth Ninja also hurts individual players working one of the major leveling activities: kopping high-tier items from new brands before they are discovered.

While there are plenty of retail sites where people kop GN gear, a lot of people play Goth Ninja by cruising the AH for deals.  High level players have honed their skills using the AH.  They utilize stylezeitgeist classifieds, styleforum classifieds, superfuture classifieds, yahoo.co.jp auctions, global.rakuten.com, ebay.com, etc.  You can also find shitty, leftover loot on Yoox... Yoox is the leftover loot from other instances and sometimes you can find high-level items but when you do you usually can't get as good a discount on them because they are likely to get snatched up quick by other players.

One of the biggest accomplishments in Goth Ninja is to acquire a grail.  That is, the first time a low level character acquires a high-level piece of loot.  Having acquired a grail shows that you're a dedicated character and you've probably dedicated some time to your class.  A lot of Goth Ninjas claim that they grind to achieve their grail.  [There's also a guide which talks about this.](http://stylezeitgeist.com/forums/showpost.php?p=219157&amp;postcount=96) Sometimes this is true, some people save up for a longer time in order to kop 1 piece that they are dying to have.  But, like in other MMOs, a lot of the high level players got there with the help of Chinese gold farmers.

Enough about general gameplay.  Here's a guide to classes:

**[Low Level Characters](http://imgur.com/a/qmYTG)** have not acquired enough exp to use heavy armor.  Heavy armor is associated with a higher encumbrance, which in Goth Ninja is defined by how often strangers make comments about your clothing.  Early levels are about getting exp in drapey t-shirts, skinny jeans and boots.  Even high level chars may wear low level gear in order to avoid stranger's comments.

**[Fighters](http://imgur.com/a/SPTzw)** typically wear light, cloth armor with a low encumbrance.  They are typified by their baggy pants.  They may wear low level tops but they equip high level pants and shoes.

**[Shamans](http://imgur.com/a/Lyy0U)** are identifiable by their drapey cloth armor.  

**[Rogues](http://imgur.com/a/cShpz)** are a common choice of class for advanced players.  They can be identified by their slim leather jackets and display their character level through the amount of stacking in their sleeves and pants - the greater the stack, the higher level the Rogue.  They also have a class bonus to using caps.

**[Sorcerers](http://imgur.com/a/OPkiW)** have widely varying levels of encumbrance.   They are stereotyped by their slim button downs and dress jackets that emphasize long sleeves.

**[Druids](http://imgur.com/a/s4WCq)** are a popular class for characters who grind in cold environments.  Druids can be identified by their armor which creates a massive torso and slim leg silhouette.

**[Warlocks](http://imgur.com/a/w50Mh)** are easily identified by their massive, pointy hoods.  The Warlock class is unique because it is unlocked only once you have maxed out your level in another class.  Only then can you have your character transition into a Warlock.

I hope some of you guys have a better sense of how this sprawling, complex RPG works.

I figured this would be a beneficial comparison for people since these are three commonly mentioned and recommended boots on MFA. They’re all different in a few ways but all share a common characteristic; they are all quality boots. They’re all good options and depending on your style, each one could serve a different purpose. You may notice that I have a size 13 in the Beckman and 12 in the other sizes. The reason is because I picked up both pair of Red Wings at their yearly tent sale and they didn't have any size 12s in the Beckman. I opted on wearing a slightly larger size since they were only $60 and had always wanted a pair. I probably wouldn't recommend doing it. Anyway... on with the review!

###Red Wing Iron Ranger
---

##Pros

The Iron Rangers get a lot of love and for good reason too. These boots are meant to take a good beating. Being from Minnesota, I put some Obenaufs LP on these at the beginning of the winter season and they’ve held up very well. These are the type of boots that can take a good beating and look better the more they experience. I love the look of the double cap toe which lends to its unique look. I frequently receive compliments on these boots whether I’m wearing them with jeans or chinos. I think these look best with jeans as it fits into the “rugged American-workwear” style that is currently popular.
  
The leather on these boots feels solid and substantial. The leather is stiff for the first few weeks but they break in nicely and without too much pain. They only took a few wears to really break in for me and I was usually wearing wool socks so it wasn’t a big deal. It’s funny when you start to compare low quality boots vs. a well constructed boot. I own an old pair of Timberland Earthkeeps and the different between any of these boots is night and day.

##Cons
Although I wore them in Minnesota winters, I did so very cautiously. The cork sole is NOT the best when the ground is even remotely wet, let alone attempting to venture out in snow. Some people might think that the toe box on the Iron Rangers is a little bulbous. I think that the pictures make it look more drastic than it actually is. If you see someone wearing them, it is hardly noticeable unlike a lot of the side view pictures that you may see of the toe box. I haven’t had great experience with the default laces they provide staying tied, even with double knots. Perhaps I just suck at tying shoes, which is entirely possible. 

---
###Red Wing Beckman
---

##Pros
Much like all work boots, these are meant to take a good beating. The soles on these are great for Minnesota winters or wet weather. If I ever need to wear a boot to work and didn’t feel like throwing on my bean boots, I’d rely on the Beckman (over the Iron Ranger or Addison). Since the sole has the great grip yet still maintains the classic look, it was a great option for traversing snow or rain. 
  
Just like the Iron Rangers, the leather on these is incredibly tough. I’ve received a few gashes in the toe of my Beckmans and you can just see how solid the leather is -- they are *meant* to take a beating.

##Cons
Once again, a similar complaint is that the toe box looks fairly bulbous. I would agree in this case. I know there are methods to lessen that make it less bulbous, but I figured I would just leave them as is. It isn’t that noticeable unless you’re looking at them from the side. In my opinion, the Beckman is a weird spot. They’re kind of dressy and kind of work-bootish too. I don’t know if this would be considered a con or a pro since I suppose depending on how you dress, they could go either way. Personally, I would rather have it reside in one clear category which I think would be “work boot”. The only other thing I would mention is that the leather on these is pretty “shiny” when you first get them. I hesitate to put this as a con because that shine begins to diminish the more you wear them (which I liked).

---
###Wolverine Addison 1000 Mile
---

##Pros
I know it may be an unpopular opinion, but I think the Addisons look great. I didn’t get the regular 1000 Mile boot because I already had a pair of the Beckman and Iron Ranger. Little did I know that the Addison would surpass both the others in the hierarchy of my “favorite pair of boots”. Since I wear business casual to work a majority of the time, the Addisons fit perfectly into most of my outfits. They work well with chinos, wool pants, or jeans. The wingtip accents and leather sole give it a dressed up enough look that they can get by with my current style. Another point that I think was mentioned a few days ago was that the 1000 Mile boots are significantly lighter than the Iron Rangers and the Beckmans. This makes them much more comfortable for wearing for an entire day walking around the city. I think I get many more compliments on my Addisons than my Iron Ranger or Beckmans combined. The leather is incredibly soft and really has that genuine feel. The leather on the IR and Beckman are obviously a little more rough while the Addison feels less treated and more natural.

##Cons
I really like the waxed laces on these but they’re either not too durable or I’m too rough when tightening my shoes. The laces have started to fray which isn’t that big of a deal. I’ve heard they’ll send you new laces for free too if you email them. Since the leather is soft, there is less support. I’m not going to be taking them hiking anytime soon but I figured it should be mentioned.

1327184841.0,463,self.malefashionadvice,oqphr,$100 MFA Starter Kit - 2.5 more days,604,141,158,http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/oqphr/100_mfa_starter_kit_25_more_days/,"I just wrote this in a comment, and I realized that this confluence of sales is pretty great opportunity for someone just starting out to build a solid, basic wardrobe for the cost of one night at the bar.  

Through Monday or so, for almost exactly a hundred bucks, you could pick up:

 *  [A pair of Keds from the $19 sale](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/oqd0t/keds_winter_shoes_sale_anything_worth_the_price/).  There are a lot of good options in white, gray, tan, brown, olive, and red still available, including [a pair designed by Mark McNairy](http://www.keds.com/store/SiteController/keds/productdetails?catId=cat610201&amp;productId=5-173480&amp;skuId=***5********MF39606*M085&amp;stockNumber=MF39606&amp;showDefaultOption=true&amp;subCatId=cat610241&amp;subCatTabId=cat1290406&amp;viewall=) ( ~~although I wouldn't be surprised if these are gone before tomorrow morning~~ Sure enough!).  [This pair,](http://www.keds.com/store/SiteController/keds/productdetails?catId=cat610201&amp;productId=5-171180&amp;skuId=***5********MF37916*M090&amp;stockNumber=MF37916&amp;showDefaultOption=true&amp;subCatId=cat610241&amp;subCatTabId=cat1290406&amp;viewall=) [this pair](http://www.keds.com/store/SiteController/keds/productdetails?catId=cat610201&amp;productId=5-173640&amp;skuId=***5********MF39013*M085&amp;stockNumber=MF39013&amp;showDefaultOption=true&amp;subCatId=cat610241&amp;subCatTabId=cat1290406&amp;viewall=), and [this pair](http://www.keds.com/store/SiteController/keds/productdetails?catId=cat610201&amp;productId=5-169270&amp;skuId=***5********MF38997*M120&amp;stockNumber=MF38997&amp;showDefaultOption=true&amp;subCatId=cat610241&amp;subCatTabId=cat1290406&amp;viewall=) would all be solid choices. [This pair](http://www.keds.com/store/SiteController/keds/productdetails?catId=cat610201&amp;productId=5-172160&amp;skuId=***5********MF37844*M070&amp;stockNumber=MF37844&amp;showDefaultOption=true&amp;subCatId=cat610241&amp;subCatTabId=cat1290406&amp;viewall=) is the simplest, and if I hadn't already ordered two pairs of the McNairy's, they're the ones I'd get.  Free shipping if you use KEDSBDAY2011 or KEDSWELCOME2011.

 * A pair of [Levi's 514s in the Tumbled Rigid finish](http://www.amazon.com/Levis-Straight-Premium-Tumbled-38x30/dp/B005OUICQU/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1327183845&amp;sr=8-1) for $40.  Slim-straight fit that's not actually very slim below the knee.  511s would be a better option if you're thin.  These are available at mid-tier department stores everywhere (JC Penney, Sears, Macys, etc), so go try some on.  They're perpetually on sale, so they'll probably be the same price in the store.  Free super-saver shipping if you order from Amazon though.

 * A half-dozen of the [$7 v-neck t-shirts from the current Lands' End Canvas sale](http://www.reddit.com/r/frugalmalefashion/comments/opbis/lands_end_canvas_7_crewsvnecks/).  Get half of them in neutral colors (gray, white, tan), and half in brighter colors (red, yellow, green).  Avoid navy (too close to the jeans) and black ([also a poor match with dark denim](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/oqphr/100_mfa_starter_kit_25_more_days/c3jf7o6)).  LEC runs slightly large, so consider sizing down from what you normally wear.  If you have a Sears near you, it's possible they'll have these in stock.  Free shipping if you use FREEZE (pin 1710), and no-questions-asked returns at that same Sears store.

Most of the US is really rolling into warm weather now, so this kit is focused on summer basics.  Add a couple more polos or tees to this, maybe a pair of leather shoes like Top-siders or canoe mocs, and you're set from now through September.  

But once again, here's the deal - nothing here is cutting-edge fashion, it probably doesn't express your personality, and it's not going to immediately turn you into a GQ cover model.  But if you just stumbled into MFA and you've quickly realized that all of your summer clothes are too big and/or terrible, this is a great opportunity to lay down a foundation.

 * [A pair of white New Balance V45 canvas plimsolls](http://www.6pm.com/product/8008906/color/751), $25 and free shipping.  Classic profile, minimal branding, and a versatile color.  As I noted above, they're not going to turn any heads, but it's hard to go wrong with a shoe that's this simple.  Wear these sockless with shorts or rolled chinos and you've got a great, classic summer look.  New Balance sneakers generally run true-to-size.  **Update:** There was a full size run of these this morning, but it looks like we've almost cleared them out.  I like [these Vans Authentics in off-white](http://www.shoebuy.com/vans-authentic/473837/1003473) as an alternative, and they're $36 shipped with the code ""MEMDAY"".

 * Two pairs of Gap chino shorts in either [10""](http://www.gap.com/browse/product.do?cid=49822&amp;vid=1&amp;pid=851165&amp;scid=851165032) or [8""](http://www.gap.com/browse/product.do?cid=49822&amp;vid=1&amp;pid=903603&amp;scid=903603022) inseams, $30/$25 each and free shipping for orders over $50.  If you're shorter or have athletic legs, go for the 8"" inseam.  Get tan, navy or charcoal if you want really versatile colors that are easy to wear bright shirts with, or the bright blue and yellow if you'll be wearing plain shirts with them (white tees, polos, or rolled-up ocbds, for example).  This sale lasts through Monday, so you'd have a chance to try their shorts on if you want to - note that they're unlikely to have the 8"" pairs in most stores, though.  Gap's pants are usually vanity-sized by 2"", meaning a pair tagged 32"" will actually measure 34"" in the waist, so either try them on or  measure a pair of pants that you already know fits you well.

 * Two [Arizona polos from JCPenney](http://www.jcpenney.com/jcp/X6.aspx?GrpTyp=PRD&amp;ItemID=1c7b48a&amp;submit%20search.y=0&amp;Ntt=arizona+jean+polo+vintage&amp;SearchString=arizona+jean+polo+vintage&amp;hdnOnGo=true&amp;Ne=4+840+877+878+5+961+6+29+3+579+963+1014+1031+8+587+15+12+1011+598+11+506+10+23+585+969+596+1022+586+1007+879+968+1027+18+904+903+833+1545&amp;NOffset=0&amp;SelDim=6~&amp;submit%20search.x=0&amp;Nao=0&amp;N=4294959029+507&amp;SO=0&amp;PSO=0&amp;CmCatId=searchresults), $12 each and free shipping to store.  *Arizona?!*  I *know*.  But [Dappered really liked them at $15](http://dappered.com/2012/04/polo-palooza-spring-2012-affordable-polo-options) - ""One of the few pique polos that feels lightweight and smooth.  It has a 'washed' effect that has really softened the fabric"" - and right now they're 20% off.  True to size, according to the reviewer at Dappered.  Probably available in store too, but I haven't checked.  For colors, anything but black is a good choice.  The safest are white, heather grey, and ""blue gem"".

**Total: $99 with 8"" shorts / $109 with 10"" shorts**

***As always, if you don't like the style, the colors, or whatever, you should put together your own $100 kit and post it.  If it's too frat-douche or too New England preppy or too dad-ish or too grandpa-ish or too hipster or too colorful or too plain or too something else, this is your official invitation to make a better one.  I don't have any special skills at this - it's mostly just waiting for sales on basics to align.  It would be great to see more people doing these, in my opinion.***

I don't know if it was an exercise in bragging rights, fishing for someone to rob, or what, but it brought up an interesting point:

*People, especially those people who might start frequenting MFA, spend a lot of money on clothing.*  

Ok, yeah.  We know that.  Often, it's a $40 shirt here, a $100 pair of sneakers there - substantial amounts sometimes, but nothing insane or bank-breaking.

But...

Then a fire breaks out.  Or a flood.  Or you're robbed.  Does your homeowner/renters insurance policy (you DO have renters, right?) cover your collection of selvage denim and Alden boots?  I've had friends experience all three events (not at the same time), and each had drastically different experiences when it came to dealing with their insurance company and getting shit replaced. (Note that naturally this doesn't just apply to clothing - if you have a dSLR or nice computer setup, that stuff should be insured as well.)  

If my house burned down today, it would cost well over $15,000 to replace all of my clothing, from my underwear to my suits, piece for piece (who wants to replace all their wings+horns henleys with Old Navy?).  A lot of people have a similar amount of money tied up in their closet and don't even realize it.

I used to keep all my receipts, pictures of my items, and details on everything in an Excel spreadsheet showing value, date of purchase, serial number, that kind of thing, but I recently saw an app called [Home Inventory](http://binaryformations.com/homeinventory/index.html) on Lifehacker and I've been meaning to try it out.

Before you do any of that though, check with your insurance agent.  Find out if you're covered, or if it's even worth it for what you have.",,False,self,t5_2r65t,False,,,True,t3_185jp8,http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/185jp8/psa_know_the_value_of_your_clothing/,

I put a draft version together to get some feedback a few weeks ago, and based on the discussion, this is the updated version.  As always, suggestions for further additions/deletions/revisions are welcome!

The guide is divided into two main sections:

&gt;**I. The Basics - Fit, Materials, and Construction**

&gt;**II. The Styles - From Shorts to Wool Trousers**

----

**I. The Basics**

 * ***Fit*** - Before you ever think about color, material and special details, you need to make sure your pants *fit* (which is no surprise if you're a regular MFAer).  In short, pants should stay up without needing a belt or suspenders, and they should follow the line of your legs.  For some guys, that's going to mean straight-leg pants, for others, that'll mean slim or skinny pants - but don't let the name get in the way of the fit.  Levi's 514 cut, for example, is labeled Slim-Straight, but thin guys will find themselves swimming in them.  I'd also advise you not to get hung up on the tagged waist size, since vanity-sizing means that a ""32x34"" pair of jeans may have an actual waist measurement of 34-35"".  [As Esquire points out, your pants are almost certainly lying to you,](http://www.esquire.com/blogs/mens-fashion/pants-size-chart-090710) which means you need to either (1) try them on, (2) order from somewhere with an excellent exchange policy, or (3) find the *actual* measurements online before buying.  Since boot-cut jeans are larger at the ankle than the knee, they don't reflect the contours of an actual human leg.  There's more discussion [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/o21zu/why_does_mfa_despise_boot_cut_jeans/), [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/m3wax/how_do_you_wear_bootcut_jeans/), [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/py3zf/my_girlfriend_thinks_bootcut_jeans_are_better/), [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/dycqg/convince_me_i_am_senseless_for_wearing_bootcut/) and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/search?q=bootcut&amp;restrict_sr=on), but the short version is that boot-cuts aren't as flattering to the human body as straight or tapered pants.  For more on the principles of fit, [Primer has the best overview I've seen.](http://www.primermagazine.com/2012/learn/how-pants-should-fit-the-principles-of-fit)

 *  ***Materials*** - Some folks use ""khakis"" and ""chinos"" interchangeably, but if you want to be pedantic about it, [""chino"" refers to the style of twill cotton fabric many casual and dress pants are made from](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinos) and[ ""khaki"" refers to a common color of chinos.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khaki_%28color%29).  Cotton is also the source of denim, and Momotaro (a high-end Japanese denim company) [argues that Zimbabwean cotton is the best](http://momotaro.fr/m1.htm).  If you'd rather wear pants that were walking around a field instead of growing in it, wool is a textile made from the magical coats of sheep.  In general, you'll want to stick with natural fibers (100% cotton, linen, or wool) over (1) synthetic blends, where a percentage of the weave is made up of a man-made material like polyester or spandex, or (2) full synthetics, like nylon.  (Note that this isn't the case for pants you might wear for athletics or other outdoor activities - running tights, hiking pants, etc.  Synthetics can help with drying and wicking, so they're great for exercise/athletic wear).  

 *  ***Construction Details &amp; Terminology*** - *Pleats* are the [sewn-in folds of fabric at the waist of some trousers.](http://i.imgur.com/KRWkb.jpg)  In almost every case and unless you have a large, protruding stomach, you'll want to avoid pleated pants in favor of non-pleated flat-front pants.  *Creases* are the ironed lines running down the front and rear of some pants, and they're generally found on more formal trousers. Creases often look out of place on casual chinos, and they're definitely a no-no for jeans.  *Rise* is a word to describe [measurement C on this chart.](http://i.imgur.com/YtVmU.jpg)  You'll generally find higher rises on dressier trousers and lower rises on pants you're less likely to tuck shirts into, like jeans and casual chinos.   *Break* refers to [the amount of fabric that's folding when your pants sit on top of your shoes.](http://www.effortlessgent.com/the-break-how-to-choose-the-best-pants-length-how-to-tell-your-tailor/)  Cuffs are [a sewn-in, permanent fold at the bottom of some trousers.](http://www.realmenrealstyle.com/dress-pants-cuffs-no-cuffs/)  Note that cuffs are different than simply rolling or folding up the bottom of chinos or jeans.  For the front pockets, the four main styles are on-seam, off-seam (or ""slash""), jeans-style pockets. In the back, you're looking at trouser pockets, flap pockets or, again, jeans-style pockets.  [Here's a photo collage with some visual examples of the different types.](http://i.imgur.com/JVlDc.jpg)  Most pants have a zipper, but many jeans (especially raw and shrink-to-fit) and some casual chinos have button flies.  Most casual pants will have a standard waist button, but dressier pants will often have a clasp, and some chinos will have a [double-](http://i.imgur.com/bA1Av.png) or triple-clasp enclosure (with a hidden button and two waistband clasps).  The goal of all these extra clasps and buttons is to make the waist of your trousers lay neatly, without pulling or rolling the material.

**II.  The Styles - From Most to Least Casual**

 * *Shorts* -  From the spring/summer guide:  Look for simple, chino shorts with a narrow leg opening. Ideally, they should be lightweight cotton that hit 1-3” above your knee (7-9” inseam, depending on how tall you are). You won’t go wrong with tan or khaki, but navy and light gray are good choices too. If your style is a little more preppy, then yellow, light blue, madras and seersucker are on the table. J.Crew, Lands’ End, Uniqlo and H&amp;M will all have good options.   For more information, there's a detailed infographic on shorts [here](http://i.imgur.com/gdN5C.jpg), and a lengthy, contentious discussion of the infographic [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/tct5c/infographic_shorts_guide/).

 * *Jeans* - There's already an incredibly thorough denim guide in the sidebar, so do yourself a favor and [dive in.](http://redd.it/gtbv4)  Here's the *incredibly, incredibly* abbreviated version - look for slim or straight denim in a dark, non-distressed wash.  No bootcut - ever.  Selvage is sometimes, but not always, a sign of quality.  If you're wearing raw/dry denim, wash is as infrequently as possible (6 months to a year between washes isn't uncommon).  At the low end, Levi's are a good choice since they make a wide variety of fits, they're available to try on everywhere, and their prices are reasonably low (although I realize they aren't nearly as affordable or widely available outside the US).  If you have access to an H&amp;M or Uniqlo, they're also good sources for affordable denim, although be aware that most of H&amp;M's jeans and some of Uniqlo's cheaper jeans are lower-quality than Levi's.  For an intermediate pair of jeans, Put This On recommends [3Sixteens](http://putthison.com/post/9336250584/my-recommendation-for-jeans-3sixteens-apcs-tend?eb8b0790), and I strongly second that.  At the high end, you're generally looking at either Japanese or US-made jeans from retailers like Self-Edge, Blue in Green, Context, or Unionmade.  

 * *Canvas ""duck"" pants* - Pants made from heavyweight canvas fabric.  The are basically blue collar work pants, which is how you should wear them - don't try to dress them up.  [Dickies \(surprisingly\) makes a slim-fitting pair](http://www.dickies.com/mens-clothing/mens-pants/Skinny-Straight-Fit-Double-Knee-Work-Pant-WP811.jsp), and [LL Bean Signature has another affordable option.](http://www.llbean.com/llb/shop/65154?feat=505933-GN3)  At the higher end, Naked &amp; Famous makes both [Weird Guys](http://www.denimgeek.com/jeans-c19/tapered-jeans-c9/naked-famous-jeans-weirdguy-selvedge-duck-p81) and Slim Guys in selvage canvas duck.  

 * *Cords* - I've been surprised to find out that corduroy pants are kind of divisive on MFA - some people strongly associate them with being dressed by their mothers as a little boy.  That's not my experience at all, and I see cords as a fall/winter staple.  They can be trouser-cut (with trouser pockets and on-seam or off-seam front pockets) or built like jeans (which are generally called 5-pocket cords).  The former are dressier, and the latter are fine with a t-shirt or untucked ocbd.  For a modern look, you'll want to look for a relatively [fine-wale cord,](http://i.imgur.com/ICEjk.jpg) although a [chunky wide-wale cord](http://i.imgur.com/bsDmX) can look great in the fall or winter with a big, heavy sweater.

Please take a few moments to read the rules and guidelines below, especially if you're new to the community.  They're designed to make this a welcoming, constructive environment, and to help you get the best possible advice.**

----


----


**I. Rules for Acceptable Posts and Comments:**

----

----

 * Any post that isn't requesting or giving advice will be removed. ""Giving advice"" is interpreted broadly to include inspiration albums, discussion topics and some new product announcements, but does not include posts about an item you just bought or an outfit you're wearing *unless you have a specific question about it* (and see Section II for more on that).  **Note: [See this post for additional rules on inspiration albums.](http://redd.it/1ao4at)**

 * Personal attacks, insults and demeaning comments based on sexual orientation, race, gender, body type or other social profile are *strictly* prohibited. Comments will be removed and repeated offenses will result in being banned from MFA.

 * Joke posts are not allowed (especially joke images, memes, image macros, comics, rageposts, advice animals, etc).

 * No sale/coupon announcements (""30% off clearance at J.Crew!"") or personal sales (""$25 OBO on this pair slightly-used Levi's 511s"").  Please visit /r/frugalmalefashion instead.

 * While most marketing efforts are prohibited on MFA, we will use our discretion to approve posts by company representatives that constructively engage with and improve the community (AMAs with [the CEO of Allen-Edmonds](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/xmo2h/i_am_paul_grangaard_allen_edmonds_pres_ceo_amaa/) and [the owner of Pointer](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/10vebm/im_the_fourth_generation_owner_of_lc_king/), for example).   All marketing efforts (including AMAs, corporate giveaways, special MFA discounts, personal kickstarter campaigns, and others) must be cleared with the mods first.  

 * Online crowdfunding campaigns (Kickstarter, Indiegogo, etc) that you are personally connected to are not permitted.  Fundraiser links posted by brand-new accounts will be treated as spam and removed.  

 * Referral links (specially-coded links which give the poster payment or credit when they're used) are not allowed. 

 * It's fine to post pictures of yourself or public figures/celebrities, but don't post pictures of friends or strangers who have a reasonable expectation of privacy.


----

----

**II. How to Ask for Advice: Guidelines and Best Practices**

----

----

 * Use the MFA search bar and look through the appropriate sections of the sidebar and/or [wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/wiki/index) before posting.  You don't need to read through the entire library to ask a simple question, but if you want to post about jeans, you should take a look at the denim guides first.  

 * Use clear, descriptive language in your title. ""I need help"" is a terrible title.  ""Looking for a grey sweatshirt under $60"" is better.  And EVEN BETTER, search the archives for ""sweatshirt"", and find [this guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/15v5ya/hirokis_mfa_guide_to_sweatshirts/) and [this review thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/182owa/mfa_reviews_thread_27_sweatshirts/) that already have lengthy, detailed answers!  

 * Strongly consider making a self-post (""Submit a new text post"") instead of a photo link.  Particularly avoid photo links titled ""How'd I do"" or ""What can I change"".  They are the worst type of low-effort posts and, more importantly, will rarely generate worthwhile feedback for you.  

 * In the body of your self-post/text-post, include as much detail as possible (including pictures and/or links to products).  Relevant details might include your budget, geographic area (especially if common US retailers aren't available to you), age, body type, personal style, and what event or context you're dressing for (work, wedding, college party, etc).  Generic questions get generic answers, while specific questions receive useful, constructive feedback.  

 * If you ask for criticism, do not get upset when you receive criticism.  Likewise, be aware that you may get responses that seem off-topic (about your posture in a question about whether or not a jacket fits, for example, or your choice of shoes in a question about a pair of pants you just bought).  Sometimes these will be useful and sometimes they will not, but keep an open mind.


----

----

**A Special Note on Voting**

----

----


Downvotes should be reserved for irrelevant posts, off-topic comments, and comments that do not add to the discussion. **The downvote arrow does not mean ""I disagree with you"" or ""That shirt doesn't fit"".**  This is a discussion forum and you're poised right above a keyboard with a bunch of letters and symbols on it - *use them.*

----

----

**Note that for all mod-related needs, there is a button above the moderator list in the sidebar. You should always feel free to message us if you have any questions or concerns.**

1327164641.0,443,self.malefashionadvice,oqc1c,"Spring/Summer Guide, v2.0",540,97,229,http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/oqc1c/springsummer_guide_v20/,"There are six inches of snow on the ground outside my window and I’m goddamn sick of it – so let’s start talking about spring/summer clothes.  The summer guide in the sidebar is a little sparse, so I took a crack at beefing it up.  Suggestions/extensions/revisions welcome!

I split it into casual and office/professional, although there’s clearly some overlap.  The former has more information since there aren’t as many seasonal changes for office clothing.  

Overall, this is the time to swap out heavyweight fall/winter clothes for lightweight items.   Color and simplicity start to take precedence over patterns and texture as the standout features of your clothes, and there’s a lot more room to experiment.     

For the clothes you’ll be putting away for a while, [here’s a guide to seasonal storage from Put This On.]( http://tinyurl.com/78zzwzf)  If you want your fall/winter clothes to look good when you get them out again in September, clean them (or have them dry-cleaned), and invest in some canvas bags, plastic bins, and cedar balls.  I also like to use the change in seasons as motivation to go through and donate what I didn’t wear.  Don't put a sweater or coat you didn’t wear all winter into storage - donate it.

**I.  Spring/Summer Casual**

April/May is the time to put away: heavy coats/parkas, dark-colored cotton sweaters, wool sweaters, cords.

The basic casual wardrobe:

 * **Shorts** – Look for simple, chino shorts with a narrow leg opening.   Ideally, they should be lightweight cotton that hit 1-3” above your knee (7-9” inseam, depending on how tall you are).  You won’t go wrong with tan or khaki, but navy and light gray are good choices too.  If your style is a little more preppy, then yellow, light blue, madras and seersucker are on the table too.  J.Crew, Lands’ End, Uniqlo and H&amp;M will all have good options.  [Here's a visual guide that might be helpful.](http://redd.it/1968m0)  Swimwear is in this category too.  Classic flat-front ""baggies"" (solid-colored nylon or poly trunks that hit mid-thigh) and knee-length board shorts are good choices. Either way, simple, solid-colored, and flat-front are what you want for swimwear.

 * **Shoes** – Probably deserves a separate post of its own, but here are some basics.  Low-top canvas shoes (Chucks, Vans, Jack Purcells, Tretorns, Keds, Spring Courts, Sperry CVO, SeaVees, etc) in white or other light colors, boat shoes, white or tan suede bucks, canoe mocs, penny loafers, driving mocs, and blucher mocs are all classic choices.   Flip-flops and open-toed sandals like Birkenstocks are kind of controversial – totally acceptable in places like Southern California but juvenile in other places (unless you’re at the beach).  Let your local culture dictate, and if you’re not sure, skip them.   If you do wear them, make sure the sandals *and* your feet are clean.   If you’re starting from scratch, you can’t go wrong with a pair of [white or navy Purcells](http://tinyurl.com/6r993jb), [Sperry Top-siders in Sahara](http://tinyurl.com/85yfccb), and [tan suede Bass bucks](http://tinyurl.com/7rfn48w).  As far as socks go, I barely wear them from May through August, but some people think that’s gross or hipster or whatever.  If you need them, lots of places make no-show loafer-cut socks.  Avoid visible socks if you’re wearing shorts or rolled-up pants.

 * **Shirts** – Fit is incredibly important.  You generally won’t be layering a sweater or jacket, so it’s harder to get by with a subpar fit.   Short-sleeve cotton polos in neutral colors (white and gray especially) or bright colors (yellow, blue, green, pink) are standard, but make sure they fit well.  The hem should hit just below your belt (no longer than the middle of your fly) and the sleeves shouldn’t go much beyond the middle of your bicep.  Treat polos like a tiny step above a t-shirt.  They shouldn’t ever be tucked in, and never button the top button.  Don’t pop the collar unless you can look down and verify that you’re on a boat.  If you don’t mind logos, Ralph Lauren Polo custom-fit shirts are fantastic.  For logo-less polos (which I personally prefer), Lands’ End, Uniqlo, H&amp;M and J.Crew are good choices.  [Kent Wang](http://www.kentwang.com/) is the master of logo-free polos, but (1) they aren't cheap, and (2) they fit really slim.  Alternatives to polos are t-shirts (obviously) and long-sleeved button-up shirts with the sleeves rolled above your elbow.   Gingham button-up shirts are a summer staple for me, but madras and tattersall are other classic summer patterns.  Look for shirts in natural fibers (cotton, linen) and avoid cheap non-iron shirts because they don’t breathe well and it’ll be like wearing a poncho.  

 * **Pants** – Look for lightweight, flat-front chinos in light neutral colors.  Lots of places make “summer-weight” poplin chinos – those are great.  Linen too, although that’s a little dressier fabric.  Spring/summer is also when no one will frown at you for rolling up your chinos or wearing non-traditional colors (red, nantucket red – which are really kind of washed-out pink – green, yellow, bright blue, etc.).  Unless you're really masochistic, this might be the time to put away those 22oz Flathead jeans you've been breaking in.  Naked &amp; Famous have made some 8-10oz summer-weight jeans the last couple years, and I'm sure they'll do it again.
 
 * **Sunglasses** – Also probably deserves a post of its own.  I like the classics – Wayfarers, Clubmasters, and Persols, but I’m terrible at not losing or breaking them, so I just buy cheap ones from a kiosk at the mall.  They have worse optics because they have polycarbonate lenses instead of glass, but provide just as much UV protection.    

 * **Hats** – If you’re going to wear a hat, let it be dictated by function.  Classic fitted baseball caps are a good choice, especially if they’re a simple design in a single color like navy, white or red.
  
 * **Jackets** - Almost anywhere you live, you’ll need at least a lightweight rain jacket once in a while during the spring and summer.  Pull-over anoraks ([LL Bean makes a good one](http://www.llbean.com/llb/shop/73093?feat=2-SR0)) and lightweight zip-up hooded rain jackets (which you can find almost anywhere, but definitely at Lands’ End and Patagonia) are good choices.  Choose a simple, classic color – red, yellow, navy, kelly green.    

 * **Sweaters** – I like to have a sweater or two for cool evenings, but this really depends on where you live.    If you live somewhere that temps drop below 60 in the evening, then it’s a good idea to have one or two summer sweaters.  Thin cotton or cotton-cashmere blends are a good choice, and bright colors (yellow, green, blue, pink) are easy to get away with in the summer.
  
 * **Avoid (or if you already own them, donate them to charity or trash ‘em, depending on condition):** denim shorts, wraparound sport sunglasses (unless you’re currently engaged in that sport at that very moment), pleated shorts, baggy cargo shorts, capris, grungy flip-flops/sandals, short-sleeve button-up shirts ([although this is controversial](http://tinyurl.com/72kzz5e)), polos with sleeves that hit your elbows, tank-tops (unless you’re at the pool or beach)

For some visual examples, I think [this](http://i.imgur.com/vDghm), [this](http://i.imgur.com/n4EP1), [this](http://i.imgur.com/PTLBE.jpg) and [the guy on the right here](http://i.imgur.com/Wrlru.jpg)are all solid spring/summer looks.  (A lot of interest in the guy in the green shirt/white pants.  It's a J.Crew catalog shot from a couple years ago, and everything it out of stock.  You should be able to find a similar green madras, white jeans, and suede Top-siders through other retailers though.)

**II. Spring/Summer Office/Professional**

April/May is the time to put away:  Wool/flannel suits in 4-season fabric, heavy tweed, heavyweight wool trousers, sweaters, ties with heavy patterns and textures (wool, flannel, tartan)  

The basic office wardrobe:

 * **Suits/Jackets** – If you don’t own a khaki or navy cotton suit, pick one up – they’re awesome and very cool (in both senses of the word).  It’s easy to wear the jacket by itself too.  J.Crew and LL Bean Signature both have well-reviewed options, and you'll be able to find cheap ones at H&amp;M or Uniqlo.  Blue or gray seersucker is another classic summer fabric, but that’s going to turn some heads unless you’re in New England or the south (and probably even then too).  A seersucker jacket is less ostentatious than the full suit.   Otherwise, look for three-season wool, and opt for lighter colors (light- to mid-gray in particular).

 * **Shoes** – Not much will change with the season here, but depending on how progressive your office environment is, you might be able to get by with loafers or even white bucks in the summertime.  If you're wearing a cotton suit, light-colored shoes (tan loafers/wingtips, or white/tan suede bucks) are completely appropriate.

 * **Shirts** – Summer-weight cotton, poplin and/or linen.  It’s extra important to avoid cheap non-iron fabrics, since they breathe terribly.

 * **Ties** – Lightweight silk &amp; knits, cotton, madras, seersucker. Bright (but not ridiculous) colors are more acceptable in spring and summer than fall/winter.  If your style leans toward preppy New England-ish, this is the time to break out the summer-themed emblematics (lobsters, whales anchors, etc).  In some offices, summers are tie-optional.  If you've got the chest to do it, open an extra button when you go tie-less.  

In my mind, examples like [this](http://i.imgur.com/DUqTX.jpg) and [this](http://i.imgur.com/IvMYn) are the ideal summer office look (although that’s clearly going to depend on where you live and how conservative your office environment is).

1307033847.0,436,self.malefashionadvice,hq1cq,This shit needs to stop MFA.,670,234,126,http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/hq1cq/this_shit_needs_to_stop_mfa/,"I'm sick and tired of hearing that everyone in MFA wants you to dress like we're in an episode of Mad Men. 
So far this week we've had people trying to get advice on how pull off the punk look, we've had veroz getting advice on outfits for an industrial/goth club, epicviking starting a wicked future jackets thread and I've seen so many sneaker threads its hard to keep track.      
           

Everytime someone makes a thread about how their urban/street/casual style is unappreciated here and then they post a pic of themselves, they're wearing a ratty baggy band shirt, ill-fitting levis and some sneakers. That is not street-*style*, in fact most of the time theres no apparent *style* at all. Sometimes they are looking for advice on how to dress better and thats okay, but you have to make that clear. It's when people post their dorm-style and then when given **legitimate** criticism they respond with ""yeah, but I'm more into urban/street style and I know MFA can't/won't appreciate it"".
      

I assure you that our lack of appreciation for street style is not because we cannot appreciate you're unique style sensibilities but because there have been next to no good examples of it and just a lot of whining about all the advice given to people who want to dress in chinos, polos, and blazers. Just because you're into a more casual style it does not give you licence to ignore the basic rules. Fit **still** matters, quality **still** matters, patterns, colours, sizing, matching, and overall look **still** matter.
Style is intentional and its universal, even if we wouldn't wear it ourselves it is still apparent that someone with a knowledge of style has selected these items intentionally.
      

As an example of what I'm talking about here are some images I NEVER see posted on MFA, these are what I consider good examples of street/urban style and of which I've seen absolutely 0 similar outfits here. Outfits like this WOULD get upvoted if posted because they are stylish and follow all the most basic rules. Even someone from wall-street could tell that the outfits were intentional and they didnt just throw on whatever was on the floor in the morning   .

When someone posted [this picture](http://i.imgur.com/uG5JG.png) and asked why dressing like this is wrong, [Oddzilla posted this response](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/hpcod/im_guessing_a_lot_of_mfaers_dont_like_this_style/c1x9gt7)   which I think should be the agreement everyone reads before joining MFA.     

&gt;I find this sort of submission to be something like submitting a picture of a ham sandwich to a gourmet subreddit and then challenging as to why it's not gathering any traction with that subreddit's members. It's not that the ham sandwich is bad in any way, it's just that there's nothing about it that stands out enough for the specified audience.
Sure, the t-shirt and jeans look is a viable alternative to looking terrible, but this is a subreddit about male fashion advice. If the main purpose isn't so much to ask for advice on how to add to your sense of male fashion, but to instantly revert to the standard clothes that you're accustomed to, then you're not really asking for advice, you're asking for acceptance.
And this subreddit isn't designed to provide comfort in your style, but to challenge it (although, a lot of times I do get a general sense that people mistake negativity for challenge by some posters here).
To sum up with the sandwich analogy: a ham sandwich isn't bad, but a hot pastrami on rye could be better. To have other people suggest the latter shouldn't be considered an insult, but rather a suggestion that you could possibly aim for a higher goal.

A pair of Aldens you've had resoled three times?  Perfect.  A collective orgasm.  A Uniqlo OCBD that's been through the wash sixty times?

1330966500.0,430,self.malefashionadvice,qiqki,By Request: $500 MFA Expansion Kit - Preppy Spring/Summer Edition,579,149,203,http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/qiqki/by_request_500_mfa_expansion_kit_preppy/,"Both times I've posted a [$100 MFA Starter Kit](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/search?q=starter+kit&amp;restrict_sr=on), people have asked for a more expensive version.  I've been hesitant to do it, because I wasn't sure what the right approach would be - should a $500 Starter Kit be lots of cheap and clearance stuff, or a handful of nicer items? 

This post is the compromise I came up with.  

I figured that most dudes looking to drop $500 for spring/summer gear have their bases covered already, so a starter kit isn't the right approach.  They don't need someone telling them to buy a dozen v-neck t-shirts.  On the other hand, anyone who finds the idea of a ""kit"" useful probably still wants *some* advice - otherwise, you don't need a thread like this.  A sticky conundrum-22 if there ever was. 

So I put together a $500 *Expansion* Kit that assumes you have spring/summer basics covered, but would like to branch out from there. A little bolder, a little less traditional, but still focused on versatility and value.  This kit is eight items, all of which can be worn with just about everything else in the kit, which means there's something like two dozen different combinations here.  Add it to the spring/summer staples you already have and it's an incredibly versatile, non-boring wardrobe.

**Total: $490.00 (plus some shipping charges)**

I want to reiterate that this kit assumes you have the spring/summer basics covered.  If you don't already have lightweight chinos in neutral colors, khaki shorts, cheap t-shirts/polos, boat shoes, plimsolls, etc, etc, etc, then those are a priority over all this nonsense.

**That said, two things to note -** 

1. Branching out from the basics is about building your own aesthetic, so take these suggestions as my opinion.  If this doesn't fit your style and you want to put together your own $500 Expansion Kit, *please, please do*.  I'd love to see other iterations of this idea, and they'd be good for the community.   

1. If someone from across the Atlantic wants to put together a British or European version with those weird, squiggly dollar signs, I'm totally happy to add it.

**—Boot features**

The sole is probably the most important part of a boot. Materials are

* [Leather](http://imgur.com/a/SJeF7#8): dress and fashion boots; good all-around but terrible in rain/snow/ice. Lightest weight.
* [Crepe](http://imgur.com/a/SJeF7#5): same pros/cons as leather, but more casual, arguably more comfortable.
* [Cork](http://imgur.com/a/SJeF7#4): like rubber; hard-wearing and decent traction, but rarely lugged.
* [Rubber/Vibram](http://imgur.com/a/SJeF7#15): most work boots, many fashion boots. Probably the standard material. Heaviest.

And forms include

* [Flat](http://imgur.com/a/SJeF7#6): leather, crepe, and many cork-soled boots have flat soles. Traction depends on material.
* [Wedge/marshmallow](http://imgur.com/a/SJeF7#17): good insulation, decent traction. Polarizing look--personally I like them a lot.
* [Lugged/commando](http://imgur.com/a/SJeF7#9): best for harsh weather. Don't go overboard on lug size; a little goes a long way.
* [Dainite](http://imgur.com/b7X1M): a type of lugged sole often found on dress boots.

Lacing: almost all boots are [open-vamp](http://imgur.com/a/SJeF7#13) Derby-style, but a few (particularly dress boots) are [closed-vamp](http://imgur.com/a/SJeF7#3) Oxford-style. Some are [no-vamp](http://imgur.com/a/SJeF7#12), eg. Chelsea- or Cowboy-style.

Height: the lowest boots are probably [Chukkas](http://imgur.com/a/SJeF7#16), but most have a [4-6"" shaft height](http://imgur.com/a/SJeF7#10) and are called ankle- or mid-height. [Some are 8"" or more](http://imgur.com/a/SJeF7#7) and you should probably avoid them.

Toe box: [Plain-toe](http://imgur.com/a/SJeF7#14) or [cap-toe](http://imgur.com/a/SJeF7#0) boots are the most versatile. [Wingtip-toe](http://imgur.com/a/SJeF7#18) boots are somewhat dressy, and [moc-toe](http://imgur.com/a/SJeF7#11) boots are much more casual.


**—Styles**

Work boots are meant to be abused. Good all-around in casual outfits, but especially in cold or wet weather. The canonical work boot is the [Red Wing Beckman](http://bit.ly/OLw5FM), but consider also the [Chippewa 6""](http://www.zappos.com/chippewa-american-handcrafted-gq-apache-lacer-boot-brown), [Eastland Caribou](http://bit.ly/Ouftlu), [Red Wing Iron Ranger](http://bit.ly/Pu2UG8), [Frye Arkansas](http://bit.ly/NEh5GU), etc. Some ""Maine woods"" boots arguably qualify, like the [Yuketen Maine Guide](http://www.norsestore.com/commodity/11457), [Quoddy Grizzly](http://bit.ly/Pzfm6b), [Oak St. Bootmakers Hunt Boot](http://bit.ly/Rq13RZ), etc.

Hiking boots are boots for hiking, but really are just boots that look a certain way. I'm *not* talking about [Merrels](http://bit.ly/Pz3y9M) or [Tevas](http://bit.ly/Tz1GKU) or whatever. Rather things like the [Viberg 66](http://bit.ly/O5OlbB), [Fracap Scarponcini](http://bit.ly/QD8xpJ), [Danner Mountain Light](http://bit.ly/NYMfii), [Diemme Roccia](http://bit.ly/PSrYqH), [Native Fitzsimmons](http://bit.ly/Pu3548), etc.

Chukka boots became super popular a bunch of years ago and now everyone has a pair of Clarks Desert Boots and you probably should too, I guess. They're defined by the way the vamp closes around the tongue and the few (usually 2, maximum 3) number of eyelets. Every manufacturer makes a pair: [Red Wing Heritage Work](http://bit.ly/OAOhmY) and [Beckman Chukkas](http://bit.ly/Tz24ZL), [Grenson (these)](http://bit.ly/Tz28Zu) and [Silas](http://bit.ly/UdHlNb), [Alden Shell Cordovan Chukkas](http://bit.ly/OAOvKX), [Allen Edmonds Malvern](http://bit.ly/NyYylk), [WWM Up](http://bit.ly/NYMtG1), [Trickers Polo](http://bit.ly/S1BBsD), [John Lobb Chukkas](http://bit.ly/PSsdlI), etc. etc.

Dress boots are a huge category that I won't even begin to do proper service to in a guide like this. Click on [this StyleForum thread](http://bit.ly/NYMsSq) and fall down the rabbit hole. They're almost always leather-soled plain- or cap-toe boots, often with brogueing. Mostly British, some American. [Grenson Sharp](http://bit.ly/SV46HM), [Loake Burford](http://bit.ly/N1oVPs), [Tricker Stow](http://bit.ly/N1nwID), [Church's Leonardo](http://bit.ly/SXqsXn), [Alden Indy](http://bit.ly/PQ1kkI), [Wolverine 1000 Mile](http://bit.ly/UdEt36), [Allen Edmonds Bayfield](http://bit.ly/Pzgyqe), etc.

Chelsea boots are slip-on, usually plain-toe boots with elastic at the ankles. [Loake Chatworth](http://bit.ly/UdHz74), [Lanvin Chelsea](http://bit.ly/PQ1nxc) (dress); [RM Williams](http://bit.ly/PyXkqn) (casual); [Blundstone](http://bit.ly/NyYG4n) (work), etc.

Fashion/general boots don't fit neatly into other categories. They're usually a bit casual, often with a nonstandard combination of shank and sole. Cowboy, Combat, Moto/Rider (aka. Harness), Monk Strap boots, etc. [Clarks Desert Mali](http://bit.ly/Pz56jS), [Yuketen Eskimo](http://bit.ly/N1p19A), [Visvim Cantor Folk](http://bit.ly/N1p1qa), [MOMA Forest](http://bit.ly/UdHEYx), [Shoto Lace-up](http://bit.ly/Oyg6sC), [Grenson Alistair](http://bit.ly/UdHDUn), etc.

**—Sizing**

Leather boots, like leather shoes, stretch in width but not in length. Boots should be snug but not tight across your foot, and you should have some room to wiggle your toes, at least a little bit, at the front. They should not slip off your heel when you walk. Remember shoes are made on different [lasts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last); it can be that a given boot or manufacturer is not a good match for the shape of your foot.


**—Care**

For the vast majority of boots, a good brushing and cleaning with [mink oil](http://www.amazon.com/Red-Wing-Mink-Oil-95160/dp/B003RK9M72) once or twice a year is more than sufficient. For protection, beeswax is best, eg. something from Obenaufs. Nice dress boots will take a polish just like dress shoes; refer to shoe care guides for that. Most boots can be worn every day; dress boots with lighter leather may benefit from a day of rest, and/or boot trees.


**—Cost**

Boots are more expensive than shoes, good boots even moreso. Generally speaking, you don't want to own boots that cost less than $100. There's plenty of good stuff available from $200, and really excellent stuff from $300.",,False,self,t5_2r65t,1352757756.0,,,True,t3_z2quy,http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/z2quy/mfa_boot_guide_20122013/,

Sorry it’s halfway through winter for most, but better late than never, I guess.

Most important rules: Don’t hang sweaters. Don’t machine wash or dry wool. Natural fibers beat synthetic. Don’t wear argyle. For fuck’s sake, don’t tuck in sweaters. Normal fit rules apply.

***Jumper versus Cardigan*** - The term “sweater” refers to both jumpers and cardigans. Cardigans are basically sweaters that button or zip in the front, as opposed to pullovers or jumpers. Most of the same rules apply to both jumpers and cardigans. Neither one is more stylish than the other, although some people say cardigans remind them of [Mr. Rogers.](http://imgur.com/a/rQb28#0) That’s not usually a problem, in fact some people think of Mr. Rogers as a style icon in his own right.



**I.	Materials.**

*A.	Wool.*

You’re probably aware that wool comes from animals—mostly sheep, but also goats (cashmere, pashmina), alpaca, and muskoxen (qivuit), to name a few. Quality and softness vary with the animal, and with the animal’s age. Generally, cashmere is softer, lighter and warmer than alpaca, which is softer than lambswool (from 7 month old sheep), which is softer than most sheep’s wool.

Wool quality depends mostly on the strength and thickness of the fiber. Finer fibers are softer, and can be spun more easily (a quality known as “crimp”). Merino wool, named for the species of sheep from which it is derived, is finer than most wool [(comparison to crossbreed pictured)](http://imgur.com/a/rQb28#14), which makes it suitable for blending with other fabrics like cashmere and silk. Fine wool is also less prone to pilling.

The main benefits of wool: Generally wool is more durable than materials like cotton and synthetics. It will last longer without developing holes or coming apart at the seams. Wool is generally a better insulator than cotton or synthetics, which is why it is used in outerwear as well. Wool does not retain body odor, which means it does not need to be cleaned as frequently.

Downsides: Wool absorbs moisture more readily than other materials. Putting a wool sweater in the dryer will cause the moisture to be lost quickly, resulting in major shrinking. Do not stick wool in the dryer. 

Caring for wool: Wash by hand in temperate water and dry on a drying rack, or dry clean. **Never wash wool in hot water or stick it in the dryer. It will shrink.** Some people stick wool in the dryer to intentionally shrink it. I don’t recommend this because it can produce unpredictable results, but if you choose to do so, it will usually shrink one full dress size. If you’re worried that your sweater smells like BO, you should hang it up in the bathroom when you take a shower.

When a wool sweater starts to [pill](http://imgur.com/a/rQb28#13), you can remove pills with a pill razor (much like a shaving razor) or [sweater stone](http://imgur.com/a/rQb28#12).

**Do not hang sweaters on clothes hangers.** You will end up with stretched shoulders. Fold them and keep them in a bureau. A wood bureau is best because it draws moisture away. Don’t stuff them in the drawer either—leave room for them to air out after you wear them.

*B.	Silk.*

Silk is a fiber produced by insects. It is more commonly used in finer clothes, but silk sweaters are common enough to warrant mention here. Silk is made from silkworm and other insects’ cocoons, which are boiled in water to extract the longest fibers. Silk is lightweight and breathable, but much less warm than wool.

Care: Mostly the same as wool. Silk will not shrink as much (about 8% of its original size, not a full dress size). Silk should be dry cleaned, and only sparingly. Also: Sweat can make silk turn a nasty yellowish color. Don’t wear it when you’re going to sweat.

*C.	Other natural fibers: Cotton, Linen, and Hemp.*

Cotton is grown from a type of gossypium plant, linen from a flax plant, hemp from cannabis. The rules of care are mostly the same for all three: They are machine washable, but should still dry on a drying rack. They won’t shrink as much as wool—although they will shrink—but drying clothes in the dryer generally causes damage to the fibers and shortens their life. All three should be kept away from moisture, as they can develop mildew. But they are less susceptible to moths and carpet beetles, and they don’t usually pill like wool.

Cotton is common and inexpensive, but has a reputation for wearing out faster than wool. Cotton provides less insulation than wool, but it is breathable, so it is worn in all seasons.

Linen is higher on the quality totem than cotton. It’s expensive and tedious to manufacture, but once made, it is a lightweight fabric used for spring and summer wear due to its perceived cool feel and breathability. (You won’t wear linen sweaters in the winter unless you’re layering, and probably not even then.) Hemp is a little heavier, and the fibers are stronger than cotton or linen. Its texture is comparable to that of linen.

*D.	Synthetics and blends.*

Synthetic materials are cheaper than natural ones. Acrylic sweaters are the most common. On the plus side, they are often more resistant to the elements (chemicals, oils, sunlight, bugs) and they tend to be machine washable. (Still dry on the rack, as acrylic will shrink and pill too.) The tradeoff is that they don’t keep their structure long, they’re usually made more cheaply, and they’re both less breathable and less warm.



**II.	Styles, Patterns, and Knits.**

Rule of thumb: Finer patterns for finer knits, brawnier patterns for brawnier knits. Credit goes to Esquire for this rule.

**Solid Color**- With solid colors, fine knit is safer for business casual, but thicker knits can be done too. Colors depend on season. Darker colors work well in fall and winter, lighter colors and pastels work well in spring and summer, navy blue works all year around.

Solid colored turtenecks frame the face well and give definition to the torso. Some people think they look [hipster](http://imgur.com/a/rQb28#11) or [effeminate](http://imgur.com/a/rQb28#10) (for better or worse), but with the right attitude they can look [manly](http://imgur.com/a/rQb28#9). (Thick knit honorable mention: [Hemingway.](http://imgur.com/a/rQb28#15)) Turtlenecks weren’t really in this season, but men’s fashion is cyclical, so expect to see them again next year or so.

A navy blue v-neck sweater with a white button down, tie, and khakis is classic business casual. It can cover a wrinkled or untailored shirt, and it keeps you warm. Crew necks are also acceptable, but in my opinion v-necks are easier to pair with a button down shirt. Darker reds are also acceptable, but since they remind me of Target employees, I pass them up over blue. 

**Stripes.** - In keeping with the rule from above: Thin stripes go better on fine knits. When it comes to stripes on thick-knit sweaters, stripes should be [broad with alternating bright and dark colors.](http://imgur.com/a/rQb28#8)

**Fair Isle/Nordic Sweater.** - Fair isle sweaters took me by surprise this season. I long associated them with the ugly sweaters in the “avoid” category, but this year there were some good ones if you knew where to look.

Besides fit, the most important bit with regard to fair isles is the color scheme—there should be a motif. Example: [Tallest Man on Earth.](http://imgur.com/a/rQb28#7) Notice how the colors are all autumnal, a rusty brown on top of a weathered, creamy color. Too many colors will make it loud, and too few will make it dull. Some contrast is good, but there should be a happy medium.

Related is the Native American knit, which is more popular in the American southwest. Honorable mention in this category: [The Dude.](http://imgur.com/a/rQb28#16)

**Aran, Cableknit, or Fisherman’s Sweater.** - Arguably a staple of the manly man’s wardrobe. There are a few stories about its origins—Art of Manliness (linked below) describes a legend where the pattern would identify the wearer’s clan, in case he was thrown overboard and drowned, and had to be identified. (According to [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aran_sweater#Myths), this is likely a myth.)

Cable knits don’t have to fit perfectly around the midsection, but they should fit in the shoulders and under the arms. See the fit section below.

**Avoid or Use Caution** - Argyle, Coogi, Ugly, Half-Zip, and Black Mannequins.

Avoid argyle sweaters. They are frequently associated with guys who are just starting to try dressing well without having read the rules. Argyle is angular and usually three colors, which are bad things for plebes. The pattern is too jarring and uneasy to work well in most settings unless the colors are muted, and even then you’re not erring on the side of caution. (One notable exception: Argyle sweaters are permissible if you’re on the golf course. Also, argyle socks are fine.)

[Coogis](http://imgur.com/a/rQb28#6) are only allowed if you’re trying to bring back [streetwear](http://imgur.com/a/rQb28#4) from the [early 1990s](http://imgur.com/a/rQb28#5). For all intents and purposes, just avoid coogis.

If you’re going to wear an ugly or gimmicky sweater, you have to understand that it’s not fashionable. People might laugh the first time they see it, or you might be wearing it to a party. That’s fine if it’s what you’re going for, but be warned, the novelty will wear off after the first time you wear it. After that, you will look like a try-hard jackass. On a similar note, reindeer sweaters should only be worn in the weeks leading up to the holidays, after which they should be retired until next year.

Half-zips are controversial, but the majority consensus is that they look dad-core.

Finally, avoid anything you see online that is displayed on a black mannequin. This is not limited to sweaters. They never fit like they do in the picture (usually because they are pinned back), and they correlate very strongly with poor quality. (Perhaps someone can link the yesstyle picture for reference.)

Make an outfit that works within the context of the challenge; posting pictures are strongly preferred.

**Today's challenge**: Recreate a classic. The challenge is to take a classic or iconic image and create your own interpretation of the look. Include the image in your post in addition to your picture. 

Please try to give constructive criticism, and if something doesn't work try to explain why it doesn't work.

Think of this as a less structured, themed WAYWT that you can experiment with and try out new looks. Have fun with it.

You may notice that right now the vast majority of the posts on the front page are advice threads and style discussion threads - mostly self posts. We even have a couple guides in the mix, which is terrific.

What you don't see is the spam queue, which is completely full of an entire week's worth of mostly pointless link threads. There is a picture of someone's new belt, which is just a brown belt and isn't asking for any sort of advice. Someone purchased two bowties. There are a handful of sales, which I hope you all know are not allowed here. Somehow a thread comparing timberlands to uggs snuck under our radar. There's a ""DAE love these shoes?"" where the shoes are exactly what Jdbee wrote about barely a day ago. 

My point is, tone down the link posts please. If you want to show off a recent purchase, there's a ""Recent Purchases"" thread in the sidebar. Every ""I bought these new AEs"" post is little more than a circlejerk. If you are asking for genuine advice, then of course that is appropriate, but please do a simple search before asking. I'll give you a tip - the spam filter treats self posts much better than link posts, especially if you are linking to stores.

I also wish for this to serve as a reminder. The items under **Important!** in the sidebar are actually important. Please read the rules, please read how to ask for advice, and if you have questions read the FAQ and the Wiki. Feel free to check out the stickies. If you are making a new post, be descriptive in the title - ""Searching for an affordable slim polo"" is a much better title than ""Guys I have a question"". I thank you for your understanding.

My Best,

Shujin

While I do not consider myself the pinnacle of men’s fashion, I do put a lot of effort in presenting myself as a well dressed professional. I pay extra to have my suits and dress shirts tailored to fit properly, avoid novelty ties and passing fashion trends, see my barber at least once per month, and err on the side of conservative dress.

Shortly after I started working at my current job, I noticed that the office’s top assistant prosecutor was fairly casual in his courtroom dress. He refuses to wear a belt with his suits saying that there is “no need” because his pants stay up without one, the soles of his shoes have visible holes in the heel, and he frequently wears gray or black undershirts under white/light blue dress shirts. This guy often appears before juries and is assigned the more “major” or “serious” criminal cases. While some of my complaints with his dress are knitpicky – not wearing a belt seems, and turning up in court in threadbare pants seem especially egregious.  

Yesterday, the subject of collar stays came up during a conversation with other co-workers. This guy had never even heard of them before – despite wearing shirts that obviously came with them. Today, I overhear him and another co-worker actually making fun of me. 

Sample dialogue:
“Hey _______ did you remember to put your pointers (her mocking term for collar stays) in today?

“I didn’t _______. I don’t know if you’ve noticed but I’m actually a man.”

Uproarious laughter followed.

From there the conversation just turned into making fun of “metros”. Another co-worker spent five minutes talking about how her husband owns only one tie that he proudly does not know how to tie.

My question to MFA is – What can be done about this? Should I just forget about it and go about my business? I think that, especially outside of the major urban areas of the country this line of thinking is not only accepted but encouraged. Anyone who actually takes pride in looking nice is viewed as an effeminate homosexual. It’s frustrating.

tl;dr – I’m openly mocked by a co-worker for dressing professionally, while he refuses to wear a belt.

This isn't really debatable; it has a practical application as it tells time. A bracelet, on the other hand, has no practical purpose, and therefore is not a functional accessory (paracord being the exception). Now, whether or not a watch is a *necessary* accessory is more open to debate, but there's one argument I want to address.

Checking your phone for the time and checking your watch for the time are two similar actions for identical purposes that give very different impressions to those around you. Casually checking your wrist to see the time is quite a bit more casual than reaching into your pocket and pulling out a phone, as well as taking less time and effort. If you're in a business situation, or even a casual conversation, it can often be considered rude to pull out a cell phone. 

If you don't like watches in general, that's fine, but quit acting as if they're a fashion-only piece. Constantly checking your phone will make you look immature.",,False,self,t5_2r65t,False,,,True,t3_zpikp,http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/zpikp/a_quick_note_on_watches_and_functionality/,

1361283939.0,402,self.malefashionadvice,18th1d,Putting together a balanced and tasteful suit/shirt/tie/pocket square outfit.,474,72,71,http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/18th1d/putting_together_a_balanced_and_tasteful/,"It's dead easy to wear a suit-and-tie and look pretty sharp. It's even easy enough to get the basics right (decent fit/style, non-garish shirt, sensible tie). But treading outside of the basics can be confusing, difficult and there's often no clear indication that you're doing anything wrong.  What shirt goes best with this suit? What tie should you pick? Dare you ask, is a pocket square a good idea and if so what kind? Let's consider the slightly more advanced topic of putting together a business outfit that's balanced, in harmony and in good taste rather than a collection of random yet inoffensive items.

For this topic we'll consider four items mainly:

* **Suit/Jacket**

* **Shirt**

* **Tie**

* **Pocket Square**

Other accessories (cufflinks, tie-bars, watches) are outside of the scope of this conversation. Shoes are pretty straight-forward and are better covered elsewhere.

When putting together these four items there are four main properties to assess:

* **Colour** - naturally a big one, but one that people tend to fixate on to the detriment of the rest. A good outfit must be balanced in colour with no clashing combinations or items that stand out in distinction to the rest of the outfit. 

* **Pattern** - Of great importance are patterns. The general advice given to people just starting is to minimise the amount of patterns you've got going on - a good, safe approach but that one starts to fall short pretty quickly. A collection of solid coloured outfits does not make for an interesting or tasteful wardrobe and the dullness and harshness of solids can start to grate.

* **Material** - so easily overlooked - the texture and weight of the materials involved are crucial to a balanced outfit. If items are too similar it starts to look dull or faintly ridiculous. Too diverse and there's no theme or consistency.

*  **Formality/Style/Context** - a harder concept to describe. A lot of people think of suits as this generically ""formal"" style of clothing but it's far from the case. Different styles of suits and different combinations of items lend themselves to different situations and contexts easily. A dressy city suit is not the same as a more country style ensemble. A white dress shirt with French cuffs is out of place on a chequered brown tweed suit.

The guidance here is aimed at a business suit-and-tie wardrobe but the principles can easily be applied to a more blazer/odd-trouser ensemble. The latter section is especially useful there. A lot of this guide may seem prescriptive or rules based ""do this, don't do that"" but try to erase that manner of thinking from your mind - the principles outlined are guidelines to steer you towards approaching your suit/tie wardrobe more critically and some foundational concepts. This manner of dress is by its nature less receptive to experimentation and discordance than others and if your aim is to present yourself professionally or well put together then certain customs and appreciations of what's ""right"" or not play a large role, for better or worse. Dressing like this, however, is not at odds with the aim of finding your own personal style or expressing yourself through your clothing - instead the aim should be to marry your own self-expression with coherence and tastefulness. So very many people sacrifice cohesion and taste in the pursuit of self-expression and over-enthusiasm - while laudable - frequently leads to disaster.

One final note is that this is also not written in the pursuit of some faux-gentleman nonsense. Nothing here is about being ""timeless"" or ""classic"" or being ""dapper"". Many people on MFA may have little call to wear a suit let alone put together a wardrobe of suit/shirt/tie essentials. However plenty - myself included - do have a regular and practical need for it and the foundational advice only goes so far in these instances. Developing the skills to consistently put together varied, exciting, coherent and tasteful outfits in a business environment is well worth the effort.",,False,self,t5_2r65t,1361288106.0,,,True,t3_18th1d,http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/18th1d/putting_together_a_balanced_and_tasteful/,

It's main disadvantage is additional weight and loss of comfort and flexibility. So the kind of shank depends on what you are looking for in the footwear.  With work boots I would want a tough shank, while with moccasins I would want a flexible shank, or none at all. I emailed footwear manufacturers asking what kind of shank they used. Here are their responses.

**Alden** - metal
*""We use metal shanks in all of our shoes.""*

**Wolverine** - nylon and fiberglass (I only asked about 1000 mile boots)
*""The nylon and fiber glass shanks tend to be lighter however more durable than a plastic shank. The steel and wood shanks are durable, however can add weight to the footwear.  The nylon and fiber glass shanks provide both durability without adding weight to the footwear.""*


**Red Wing** - steel and a combo of nylon, plastic, and fiberglass
*""We use a few different shank materials. These are fiberglass, steel, lineman, and TC tech. The lineman shank is made from steel but wider than traditional steel shanks, they are designed to provide extra strength and support to withstand the rigors of climbing. The TC tech shank is made of a combination of nylon, plastic, and fiberglass. Our Heritage styles typically use a steel shank.""*


**Allen Edmonds** - no shank
*""Most of our shoes are welted shoes that do not carry a shank. Allen Edmonds “Shankless” construction allows the foot and leg muscle to exercise and relax properly.  This promotes long term foot care and provides for more comfortable wearing.  Some shoes are stitched only up to the heel and then nails are used of a shank.  Allen Edmonds Uses a full 360 degree stitching welt and no nails in the heel to provide ultimate flexibility and comfort.""*


**Chippewa** - steel &amp; fiberglass
*""Some boots are manufactured with Steel Shanks, some with Fiberglass Shanks.  It is dependent upon the boots.  The Classics with the smoother soles are manufactured with the fiberglass shanks as this makes the boots a lighter weight boot.  The classics with the lug soles are manufactured with steel shanks as they are made with heavier material with the lug outsoles already.""*


**Yuketen** - steel
*""We use steel shanks in most of our heavy-duty footwear.  Some styles, such as summer moccasins, don’t benefit from inclusion of shanks.  The reason why we use steel for our shanks is because it is a strong and lightweight material which can be successfully manipulated by our craftsmen/craftswomen.  For these reasons we believe steel is the best and most suitable material to make shanks for our footwear.""*


**New England Outerwear** - no shank
*""We are not using shanks in any of our true-moc constructed boots or shoes (which is everything on the site currently). We may use them in toe-lasted product in the future, but we haven't made a determination on this yet...""*


**Timberland** - metal or fiberglass (interchangeably) and nylon.
*""We appreciate your inquiry about the use of our materials. In any 6-inch premium boots there can be either a metal or fiberglass shank. There is no way to tell unless they are x-rayed. Some days the factory uses metal, and other days fiberglass. This is not used in all of our footwear. The Timberland PRO line has boots that have a nylon shock diffusion plate instead of a shank.""*


**Church's** - metal
*""All Church’s shoes use a metal shank""*


**Tricker's** - wood
*""We use wood shanks on all our footwear.  We do not need to use steel fluted shanks as our shoes have relatively low heels.   Also as the insoles are leather we can achieve a better cemented bond than steel, which would ideally have to secured with a metal rivet.""*


**Meermin** - steel
*""We do use steel shanks, which we mount over a piece of leather of 3mm, as you can see in the pictures. We have been using the same material for decades, with great results.""*


**Dr. Martens** - no shank
*""The only time we use shanks is on ladies high heeled fashion, we use metal shank ( which sits in between the sole and insole ) lower heeled versions would be hard plastic. Non of are basics such as 1460 - 1461 use shanks""*


**LL Bean** - steel
*""All of our Bean Boot/Maine Hunting Shoe products have a steel shank.  Steel was the best option when the boots were first developed in the early 20th century. It worked well with the related material in the boot, rubber, and the manufacturing methods used.""*


**RM Williams** - fiberglass
*""We have been using fibreglass shanks for production from the 16th January 2011.  This is because they are airport friendly.""*


**Johnston &amp; Murphy** - fiberglass
*""We use fiberglass shanks due to Airport Friendly guidelines.""*

**Steve Madden** - didn't understand the question
*""We would like to inform you that the material used for our products is different, from one design to another. Some styles are made out of leather, others have a man-made material. We would kindly ask you to provide us with the name of the style you're interested in so that we can further check.""*

**Clarks** - metal, plastic, or no shank.
*""The shoes that contain shanks either have one made from metal or plastic. The Desert Boot does not contain a shank.""*

**Russell Moccasin** - steel
*""We use steel because it is the strongest and most rigid. We use the same for all footwear.""*

**Bass** - nylon and steel
*""Some styles have nylon shanks and some have steel shanks. We do not specify.""*

**Sorel** - fiberglass, nylon, and no shank. They asked for a particular shoe so I gave the caribous.
*""The Caribous do not have a shank, as they are not built for support. They are straight rubber with no shank in the middle. A boot like the Kitchner Frost has a shank made of Fiberglass and Nylon.""*

**Walkover** - metal
*""The info I received from the manufacturer: We use metal shanks – metal is firmer and bendable. Wooden or plastic can snap and break after walking in them for a while. We use different shapes and thickness but they are all metal""*

**Loake** - metal flute with board shank and a wooden shank
*""We use two types of shanks in our Loake shoes; metal flute with a board shank, and a wooden shank. The reason we use different shanks is down to the shape of the in-step of the last.  This is to make sure the heel pitches correctly,""*

**Diemme** - no shank 
*""If you are referring to the styles on diemmefootwear.com we don't use shanks for these styles. The foot rests on footbed (leather on vegetable latex), intersole, midsole and outsole.""*

**Paul Smith** - metal
*""For Men's and Women's footwear we use metal shanks. We use them mainly on shoes with leather soles, jeans products are usually made from plastic moulds. The shank acts as the back bone/spine of all shoes giving support and stability""*

**Frye** - steel, fiberglass
*""As a rule of thumb for heel heights higher than 20 mm we encapsulate a Forged Steel Shank into a Tuck Board (Normally constructed of a Fiberglass / Cardboard combination) attached to the Insole.  The Forged Steel is a flat piece that has a couple of Ribs in it to maintain its shape over the lifetime of the Shoe / Boot, and is to provide strength to bridge the gap between the breast of the heel and the Strike area on the Outsole while providing a bit of Spring during the stride.  The Tuck Board provides the shape that is visible on the bottom of the Outsole in the Shank area of the Shoe /Boot.""*

**Crockett &amp; Jones** - wood
*""We use wooden shanks in all of our shoes and boots. Some manufacturers use metal shanks and there is not a lot of difference but we have always prefered to use the wooden shanks and these should not cause any problems for people travelling through airport security scanners. Sometimes if the shoes have metal shanks then they cause the scanners to beep when they go through security which can be annoying.""*

**Ecco** - metal, carbon fiber
*""We have a few shoes that still have a metal shank and the ones that are airport friendly have a carbon fiber shank.""*

**Caterpillar** - steal, ???
*""The majority of our Cat Footwear styles feature steel shanks, but there are styles that do not.""*

**Eastland** - steal, no shank
*""We use steel shanks on all our footwear that requires a shank to keep the toe/heel areas from collapsing.""*

**Viberg**
*""Our stitchdown boots(SD) like almost all of our fashion boots have a stainless steel shank while our nailed construction(NC) boots ie work boots all have a hardwood shank.""*

1311134352.0,400,self.malefashionadvice,iuhx3,A Streetwear Introduction,522,122,159,http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/iuhx3/a_streetwear_introduction/,"I keep seeing threads popping up on MFA complaining about traditional style and yet no one seems to start threads about street style. So here's a basic primer of non-designer streetwear brands (people always complain about jcrew's price so I'm not about to recommend $400 sneakers). We're talking patterned shirts, denim, sweatshirts and hoodies, casual jackets and sneakers. Shit you wouldn't wear to work unless you are an artist or a musician. 

First off though, many denim brands discussed on MFA could be suggested in this guide, but because they're talked about all the time I'll avoid more discussion of APC and levis. 

**A SELECTION OF BRANDS**

*This is just a primer. There are tons of streetwear brands, just look under the brand list on karmaloop or 80spurple. These are just (some of) the heavyweights in the lower end: do not be afraid to explore.*

$$$ Supreme - Popularized by tyler the creator and odd future (although yes, they have been popular in the fashion scene way before them). Known for out there patterns and color schemes. Examples: [varsity jacket](http://yolouis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/supreme-2011-springsummer-lookbook-18.jpg), [floral shirt](http://yolouis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/supreme-2011-springsummer-lookbook-9.jpg), [leather jacket](http://yolouis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/supreme-2011-springsummer-lookbook-2.jpg)

$$ Warriors of Radness - So Cal surf inspired clothing. Bright colors, short shorts, out there patterns. Not for everyone. Examples: [striped hoodie](http://www.warriorsofradness.com/media/galleries/27/gallery_images/420/gallery_image/420_gallery_image_705662589.jpg), [tanks and shorts](http://www.warriorsofradness.com/media/galleries/27/gallery_images/421/gallery_image/421_gallery_image_898775809.jpg)

$$ Naked &amp; Famous - Canadian designed mid level japanese denim. They do basic shirts as well. Examples: [selvedge denim](http://www.nakedandfamousdenim.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/Indigo-Selvedge-front-225x369.jpg)

$ Unbranded - Denim line made by naked &amp; famous, good quality for the price. Sold at urbanoutfitters and the like. Examples: [selvedge denim](http://www.denimology.com/2010/04/unbrand-thumb-440x338-37298.jpg)

$ Obey - Shepard Fairey's clothing line. They pump out a pretty big collection each season, and do some pretty cool jackets on the cheap. Examples: [coated black jacket](http://shop.obeyclothing.com/images/PRODUCT/medium/OJ0195_210_COATEDBLACK.jpg), [pocket crewneck sweatshirt](http://shop.obeyclothing.com/images/PRODUCT/medium/OSF290_111_HEATHERGREY.jpg), [chinos](http://shop.obeyclothing.com/images/PRODUCT/medium/OP1263S_111_KHAKI.jpg), [denim](http://shop.obeyclothing.com/images/PRODUCT/medium/OP1231_110_RAWINDIGO.jpg)

$ French Connection - They do a lot more than just tees with fuck mispelled on it. Some really interesting color blocked tees, hoodies and jackets. Very minimally branded compared to a lot on this list and a little bit more 'grown up' in terms of subdued colors and patterns. Examples: [color blocked hoodie](http://usamedia.frenchconnection.com/stormsites/fcus/images/products/large/58BQ5.jpg), [geometric pattern shirt](http://usamedia.frenchconnection.com/stormsites/fcus/images/products/large/52GH5.jpg), [leather jacket](http://usamedia.frenchconnection.com/stormsites/fcus/images/products/large/55AS5.jpg), [color blocked and striped polo](http://usamedia.frenchconnection.com/stormsites/fcus/images/products/large/56CB5.jpg)

$ WESC - Swedish surf/skate influenced clothing. They sell entry level denim and are known for logo tees &amp; headphones but have good options for color blocked tees, jackets, and patterned shirts. Their newly introduced shoe line has some knockoffs of common projects for decent prices. Examples: [basically achilles lows](http://www.hardcloud.com/uploads/products/b205494-001-wht_a_300.jpg), [denim](http://wesc.com/img/public/item/31805/default,pdetail,default,b105127_341_f_1.jpg), [basic black jacket](http://wesc.com/img/public/item/28401/default,pdetail,default,b105436999f_33941.jpg), [color blocked jacket](http://wesc.com/img/public/item/28450/default,pdetail,default,b102332001f_33935.jpg), [varsity jacket](http://wesc.com/img/public/item/28467/default,pdetail,default,b10450122bf_33813.jpg),

$ Cheap Monday - Very cheap denim. Examples: [denim](http://www.karmaloop.com/vendor/CHE/zoom/0100024-orgzoom3.jpg)

$ Alternative/American Apparel - These two brands are very interchangable and both do basic garments and tees. If the price seems steep look on forums for wholesalers who will dropship. 

$ RVCA - Another surf/skate brand. They do a lot of basics and a lot of logo tees. Examples: [sweater](http://www.karmaloop.com/vendor/RVC/zoom/10140073-blkzoom4.jpg), [denim](http://www.karmaloop.com/vendor/RVC/zoom/10310033-bluzoom3.jpg), [logo tank](http://www.karmaloop.com/vendor/RVC/zoom/11160005-whtzoom1.jpg)

**FOOTWEAR**

Alife - clean, simple, lower profile sneakers.  
Clae - don't buy at full price, they appear on jackthreads every other week  
Creative Recreation - I fucking hate them but they need to be mentioned  
Generic Man - laced shoes and loafers  
Generic Surplus - brand run by generic man, more focus on sneakers than generic man, also cheaper  
Gourmet - large array of sneakers  
Supra - ""moon boot""-ish high top sneakers and more out there low tops   
Nike - shout out for blazer high vintage   
Vans - if you don't know vans you should get off the internet   
Wesc - recently started doing shoes, a lot of them are just knockoffs of common project designs (in a good way)  
  
**KEY ITEMS / BASIC WARDROBE**  

*TOPS*  
buttoned shirts (plaids, flannels, striped, solids, etc)  
tees/tanks/polos (striped, solids, color blocked, logo/graphic are acceptable but would not be my first choice)  
sweatshirts - crewnecks, hoodies, pullovers (solids, patterns, logo/graphic, colorblocked)  
sweaters (cardigans in solids, patterns, and colorblocked)  
  
*OUTERWEAR*  
varsity jackets, trucker jackets, windbreakers, military-ish jackets (keep colors and patterns simple, always go dark over light)

*BOTTOMS*  
dark denim, heavy chinos, shorts

*SHOES*  
sneakers - your pants will dictate the shoes, the wider the leg opening the wider the silhouette of the shoe should be (think the difference between a pair of dunks and sambas), if you know what you're doing larger profile shoes can work with slimmer denim but not vice versa. go for lower profile ones with shorts



**STYLING**  

Fit is hugely important but there is much more leeway for fit in streetwear than there is in traditional style. Many brands do hip-hop inspired relaxed fits and many brands do contemporary slim fits. A lot of brands do both. Make sure there is not a huge disparity between the fit of the top and bottom halfs - an oversized shirt can look good with really slim denim but only if you know exactly what you're doing, so for the most part make sure they fit relatively similarily. 

Pairing items is relatively easy depending on the look you're going for. Matching patterns and colors can make it tricky though. The easiest thing to do is only have one loud pattern per outfit. For example, if you're wearing a plaid shirt, stick to a basic jacket instead of one that is patterned. If you are wearing a basic tee, wear a louder sweater or sweatshirt, but never be afraid to keep an entire outfit simple. Brand lookbooks are a very good place to look for pairing ideas as well, especially considering the overlap of products most brands have. 

Here is a very basic pairing template, although I'm sure it is very obvious:

SPRING / SUMMER:   
tee / tank + shorts + sneakers  
 
FALL / WINTER :  
  
tee + denim / pants + sneakers + (hoodie / sweater / jacket)  
crewneck / popover + denim / pants + sneakers + (jacket)  
buttoned shirt + denim / pants + sneakers + (hoodie / sweater / jacket)

Here's a [video](https://vimeo.com/63594345) that we posted on MFA two days ago about what a typical work day for us is like - I'm sure many of you have seen it already.


Neither of us have any formal fashion training; we learned on the job and grew the brand from a t-shirt line to a full head-to-toe collection in 7 years, and then decided to focus exclusively on our denim offerings about 3 years ago.

1353088888.0,389,self.malefashionadvice,13b4lg,The Beginner's Guide to Uniqlo v1.0,439,50,86,http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/13b4lg/the_beginners_guide_to_uniqlo_v10/,"I thought since there are going to be lots of questions for the time being about Uniqlo, and lots of recommendations for them in the future, it would be nice to have a little overview of the products they have available.

You can skip ahead to ""Outerwear"" for the main guide, but I recommend reading everything.

**Disclaimer/explanation:** Why did I write this?  Basically, I have spent way too much time going to Uniqlo over the past year or so, trying things on constantly.  I think I have a pretty good knowledge of their product range. I just wanted to have a thread that we could point people to that would lay things out for those who had generic questions about this ""Uniqlo thing they've been hearin' so much about.""  Having an entire guide devoted just to one brand for its own sake is perhaps a bit short-sighted overall, but MFA has gotten people so hyped on Uniqlo, I think the demand is there, and maybe we can help guide people towards what they should actually be spending their money on, and why.  While this guide isn't an attempt to shill Uniqlo, it is to a certain extent written within a fashion vacuum, with little to no recommendations on what a better alternative to a certain garment might be within the same price range.  The whole idea with Uniqlo is that those alternatives will be few and far between, but they are definitely out there in certain cases. 

**This is a work in progress - any additions, questions, corrections, and elaborations are encouraged.  I will edit and append as much as I can.  If anyone can help contribute links to Uniqlo fit pics, reviews, etc from MFA or elsewhere, that would be most helpful.**

----

A few things to start:

**1) Why buy Uniqlo:** Because they offer decent quality clothes at a fair price, simply put.  Uniqlo hits a real sweet spot on the Venn diagram of Affordability, Quality, and Style for basic menswear staples.  The majority of their designs keep things pretty simple, color selection is generally good, and the trends they do cash in on tend to be pretty safe ones.  Also the cut of their clothing is extremely accessible - on the slimmer side (proportionally), but not to any extreme lengths.  A very large majority will be able to find things that fit.

**2)** ***This cannot be stressed enough -***  **USE THE SIZE CHARTS!** Uniqlo's fairly comprehensive sizing charts and measurement guide are a blessing compared to some online retailers.  Learn your body measurements.  Measure garments that fit you well.  Make use of these numbers.  Knowing is half the battle, and the returns aren't free.  This guide is not meant for those asking ""How does Uniqlo sizing compare to X?""  Do your homework.  **The measurements on Uniqlo's size charts are the measurements of *that specific garment*, so its ideal to measure a similar garment that fits you well to see how they will compare.**

**3) Careful what link you use:**  The site has a very annoying habit of listing items multiple times just to pad out the visual layout.  For some reason these use different URL's that sometimes have differing available size and color combinations of the same items, so just watch out for that.  If you need to confirm that two separate links are the same thing, check the six-digit Item Code.  **Also, links to the webstore tend to 404 quite a bit, but I've always had success when reloading the page or hitting back and reclicking the link.**

Edit: **4) Customer Feedback:**  From talking to employees, its been made clear to me that Uniqlo places a high value on customer feedback, as any growing company should.  I've heard anecdotally that customer comments get read personally even pretty high up on the corporate chain, and even just a handful of requests or complaints on the same issue can prompt direct action.  Want a shipping option for Canada?  Want them to make MIJ denim in a wider range of cuts? [Let them know.](http://www.uniqlo.com/us/help/how-can-we-help)  Its not a futile gesture.

I'm going to list things as they are categorized on the store site for ease of reference and linking.  Also this version of the guide will naturally focus only on fall/winter items as that is whats available and relevant right now as far as the US online store is concerned.

----

**Outerwear**

[Blazers](http://www.uniqlo.com/us/mens-clothing/mens-outerwear/mens-blazers) - Great fit for the price - slim cut, relatively high armholes.  Stick to the simple designs.  Things in the $60-80 price range are a pretty safe bet.  The fancier $100+ jackets are a little less consistent, as their attempts at fancier materials like tweed or velvet have a higher tendency to give away the cheapness of the material compared to a more expensive alternative.  You might like them just fine but be wary - there's a reason most tweed jackets cost more than $100.  The exception to this pricing rule I just made up is if you are looking for a suit, in which case you are looking for the [Tasmanian Wool Jackets](http://www.uniqlo.com/us/store/made-for-all/men-tasmanian-wool-blended-slim-fit-jacket/070825-04-006).  They are priced between $100-150 depending on time of year, and are worth the extra cash over the other polyester-blend options if you are looking for suiting.

[Jackets](http://www.uniqlo.com/us/mens-clothing/mens-outerwear/mens-jackets) and [Coats](http://www.uniqlo.com/us/mens-clothing/mens-outerwear/mens-coats) -  Outerwear is one category where Uniqlo is pretty consistent.  Their fall/winter jackets are well designed and high quality for the price more or less across the board. If you like the design, chances are its a safe buy, and probably higher quality than any alternatives in that price range.  People are always looking for pea coat recommendations, and [their offering](http://www.uniqlo.com/us/store/made-for-all/men-wool-blended-pea-jacket/073087-09) this year is a fantastic option for the price (its even a good option compared to many that retail for closer to $200).  Also of note are the [Premium Down Ultra Light Jackets](http://www.uniqlo.com/us/store/made-for-all/men-premium-down-ultra-light-jacket/072570-69-004) and [Vests](http://www.uniqlo.com/us/store/made-for-all/men-premium-down-ultra-light-vest/072571-32-004).  While not warm enough to be a stand-alone winter jacket in colder climates, these are great layering pieces.  They are extremely thin, light, and compressible, and surprisingly warm for how light they are.  They can be layered under almost anything, and while some may not like the semi-glossy appearance, they are a good option for adding some color to a late fall/winter outfit.

----

**Tops**

[Dress Shirts](http://www.uniqlo.com/us/mens-clothing/mens-tops/mens-dress-shirts) - Lots of options here, good for building or expanding your more formal-looking shirting on the cheap.  The [Stretch slim fit](http://www.uniqlo.com/us/store/made-for-all/men-stretch-slim-fit-long-sleeve-shirt/070878-01-005) is the the smoothest/thinnest, and the [Non-Irons](http://www.uniqlo.com/us/store/made-for-all/men-super-non-iron-long-sleeve-shirt/070603001-60-004) are the thickest/stiffest, with everything else falling somewhere in between.  Just pay attention to the sizing, as there are a few different cuts mixed in here.

[Casual Shirts](http://www.uniqlo.com/us/mens-clothing/mens-tops/mens-casual-shirts) - The oft mentioned Uniqlo Oxford Cloth Button Down is currently available in two slightly different cuts, the explanation being that [one is just backstock](http://www.uniqlo.com/us/store/made-for-all/men-oxford-long-sleeve-shirt/069233001-73) from last year, and [the new one](http://www.uniqlo.com/us/store/made-for-all/men-oxford-slim-fit-long-sleeve-shirt/074796-12-004) has a slightly slimmer updated cut.  Sizes on the slimmer one are quite low as of this writing, but the difference between the two cuts is fairly slight.  The Flannel and Broadcloth shirts are pretty self-explanatory, decent quality for the price.  The quality of the flannel material isn't on the same level as something you'd pay $50+ for, but still a solid cheap option.

[Fleece](http://www.uniqlo.com/us/mens-clothing/mens-tops/mens-fleece) - Its cheap 100% polyester fleece.  Looks and feels cheap.  Not really recommended.

[Sweatshirts](http://www.uniqlo.com/us/mens-clothing/mens-tops/mens-sweatshirts) - Solid options for hoodies and crew necks.  Cotton count is a little low, but the polyester actually keeps them looking nice and consistent through repeated wears, and they are decently soft and comfortable.

[T-shirts](http://www.uniqlo.com/us/mens-clothing/mens-tops/mens-t-shirts) - The ""Soft Touch"" shirts ride a nice line between heavy T-shirt and light-weight cotton sweater.  The Dry Packaged T-shirts are the standard Uniqlo T-shirt - nicely cut, cheap and comfortable, and they hold up pretty well.

[Sweaters + Knits](http://www.uniqlo.com/us/mens-clothing/mens-tops/mens-sweaters-and-knits) - Hit or miss quality wise, and not the most durable garments ever produced.  Yet they still manage to be a decent buy for the price more often than not.

* Cashmere - Not stand-out quality cashmere, relatively speaking, but it still feels nice and most of the colors look good.  They are better quality than department store cashmere sweaters that cost about the same.  All the pain of taking care of a $200 sweater for half the price!

* Merino - Decent.  They are soft and warm, but be aware that they are on the thin, drape-y side of what you would expect from a merino sweater.

* Lambswool - 100% lambswool sweater for $20, huh?  Yup, they are itchy, they shed, and they are super thinly woven, to the point that the color of your shirt may show through the sweater depending on color combo and sweater tightness.  But they are warm as hell and nicely cut, and might be a decent fast fashion buy to add some color to a winter wardrobe.  Not really recommended though.

* Heavy-gauge - Hey look, left-over +J and UU!  Get on that - but as always, pay attention to the measurements, people.  Otherwise, lots of polyester here, but they still manage to look and feel halfway decent despite it.  Same goes for the fair isle stuff.

[Polos](http://www.uniqlo.com/us/mens-clothing/mens-tops/mens-polo-shirts) - The best polos in the price range, much better than Target. Just out of season left overs at the moment.

So it's been awhile since I added anything of substance, and I figured that having a discussion about this topic might be useful. Backstory: I ordered a made-to-measure (MTM) shirt a couple years ago. I wore it sparingly, thinking it too nice to be wrong regularly. Recently, as I was trying to apply for jobs, I wore said shirt to a couple interviews. Each time I put the shirt on, I couldn't help but give a little ""wow"" to how well it fit, how good it looked, and how comfortable it was.

Thinking on that, I went back to the website where I ordered the shirt from. Currently, you can purchase a MTM shirt for $60-$140 there. Other MTM websites had shirts as low as $34; none that I found were more expensive than $140. Most of these websites have a very forgiving return policy as well (i.e., if it doesn't fit, we'll fix it if you send it back). Compare those prices to most retailers--more expensive, sure, but not by much. Brooks Brothers' shirts sit between $30-$80, depending on if they are on sale. Express is $30-$60.

Almost always, you will never fit correctly in an OTR shirt. With these MTM websites, you control all aspects of the design--collar type, buttons, pockets, cuffs, placket, fabric type, etc. I would almost think at this point, that if you want a new shirt, you'd be foolish to not get it MTM. The only exceptions that I can think of would be if you're on an extremely tight budget--even then, I would say that three MTM shirts would beat six OTR shirts in terms of overall quality.

So, what are your thoughts?",,False,self,t5_2r65t,False,,,True,t3_phpga,http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/phpga/buying_shirts_why_you_should_never_go_offtherack/,

I was fairly happy but I was still on the search for some selvedge to give it a try... but everything made in the raw/selvedge/japanese denim market is really biased toward skinny dudes.. which I always considered myself skinny until I started buying clothes to fit me right.

After hearing plenty of good things about Unbranded I decided to get my measurements and give it a try. I wanted something with a taper so I picked out the [UB201 Tapered cut](http://theunbrandedbrand.com/collections/all/products/ub201-tapered-fit-indigo-selvedge). Boy were my measurements off. I measure in at about a 23"" thigh. and a 33"" waist. Based on those measurements I opted for the size 33 (which says it runs a 34 in the waist) I waited a week for those jeans and I was giddy the day they arrived. 

Trying to put those things on was like trying to fit into my jeans from 5th grade. Ain't gonna happen. My thighs were simply too big. I couldn't even pull the things up to my waist.. let alone button them.

So I went back to the site and picked out the size 36. I figured 34 was nowhere near enough of a size up.. and 35 doesn't exist I guess. 

I will let the pictures speak for themselves here but I am much happier with these.

[Normal](http://i.imgur.com/d0kYPTy.jpg)

Admittedly, they are a tad tight in the thighs still but I actually have more room than it looks like in the photos. Plus they are fresh out of the packaging, still very ridged and not stretched at all. I figure in a few weeks it will be perfect. 

Here are some of my measurements to base off of:

Waist: 33.5
Upper thigh: 23
Inseam: 33

I think my only fit complain is the rise is REALLY low compared to what I am used to and it feel like when I bend over everyone is checking out my ass. Dumb stupid big sexy ass.

1347483465.0,378,self.malefashionadvice,zsaj4,Leather Jackets: A Lengthy Buying Guide (v1.0),454,76,155,http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/zsaj4/leather_jackets_a_lengthy_buying_guide_v10/,"**Preface**

No single item of clothing screams ""Badass"" like a leather jacket. For decades, these jackets have been a staple piece for every larger-than-life-baddass you can think of. Because of their very nature, leather jackets are not an accessory, they are a statement or a lifestyle piece. An entire outfit can be built around a single statement piece like a leather jacket, even whole wardrobes. Women will love you. Men will want to be you. (Don't believe me? Read this [review NSFW-language](http://goo.gl/UfyQa).

For that reason, never skimp on your leather jacket purchase. Look around. Take your time. Make your decision wisely because this is an investment. Be prepared to spend no less than $500 on an entry level leather or more around $1k on good leather. Yes, you can find some really crappy companies selling for around $200 or $300, but I would generally avoid those because they use cheaper leather which will not last as long and they usually do not have a fitted cut. If you really need to pick something up for the 250-500 range, it's a much better idea to look for used or vintage items on ebay or buy/sell forums. This is definitely one of those places where the rule should be ""Don't buy something similar to the thing you want. Buy the thing you want."" 


Also, a word of CAUTION to the novices: A leather jacket can be the fast lane to [swagger like you know who](http://www1.pictures.fp.stylebistro.com/Mick+Jagger+Outerwear+Leather+Jacket+kI6ha1OHazox.jpg), but can also be a [fast route to anti-swag](http://www.dynamicleather.com/images/men's%20leather%20jackets/8025~Front.jpg). Leather jackets are not to be taken lightly. If you are new to the fashion community, do NOT rush into a leather jacket thinking that just because you put one on it will give you insta-swag. You must already have everything else pretty much on point to have the prerequisite amount of swag to pull these off.

**Styles**
Every leather company always makes jackets in a few different styles. If you find that you like the quality of one company but want a specific cut, I would suggest looking around their products because you'll invariable find that style of jacket in their list of offerings. If not, you could even hold off because they might just make it next season. The 3 major styles you'll see most often are Bomber, Double Rider, and Moto. More details are below, but as you get to know each style, you'll find a lot of the other weird cuts are just variations of these 3 styles.

* **Bomber** (aka Flight Jacket, aka [MA-1](http://goo.gl/ysrjT)) - One of the most popular and versatile styles of leather jackets. Because they were originally developed for pilots sitting in unenclosed cockpits, they are designed with warmth in mind and are characterized by elastic/ribbed cuffs and elastic waist and will frequently have fur lining and/or a fur collar. They can be worn [casually](http://i.imgur.com/KuDwW3i.jpg) or [dressed up](http://i.imgur.com/XEmsgHO.jpg) over [business casual attire](http://cdnd.lystit.com/photos/2011/07/12/ralph-lauren-purple-label-brown-leather-bomber-jacket-product-2-1123791-514010350_full.jpeg) equally well. Definitely a good versatile addition to anyone's wardrobe. Example of killer swag in a bomber? [Our very own Renalan](http://i.imgur.com/su6Hg.jpg)
* **Double Rider** (aka [Perfecto](http://iwouldcoco.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/schott-perfecto-jacket-with-no-one-inside.jpg)) - The original first leather motorcycle jacket developed by Schott NYC and introduced in 1928. This is the jacket that was worn by [Marlon Brando in The Wild Ones](http://thezipper.umwblogs.org/files/2009/04/marlon-brando-the-wild-one.jpg), [The Ramones](https://secure.schottnyc.com/forum/attachments//530x1000/animal_boy.jpg), punk rockers, and greasers, and [all around badasses](http://filmpopper.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Terminator.jpg) since their introduction. This jacket has become synonymous with rebellion and is not to be taken lightly. It was made for motorcycle riders so it was meant to be functional. This jacket has a very distinct look because of it's asymmetrical front zipper and large snap lapels. Usually meant to be worn casually, but can be added over a button up and tie for an [edgier look](http://cdn.hypebeast.com/image/2011/04/bedwin-leather-jacket-3.jpg). So the next question you should ask yourself is.....[Are you man enough to rock the DR?](http://cdn.dressed.so/i/4f4ce2623c367m.jpg)
* **Moto (aka Cafe Racer)** - The deconstructed minimalist motorcycle jacket. It is a smaller simpler version of a Double Rider Motocycle jacket that is a little slimmer and will not include the extra flaps, epaulets, and belts found on the rider. This jacket usually has a little more sleek modern  look to it. Unlike the double rider, this jacket does not have an asymmetrical zipper and will usually have a [small snap collar](http://i50.tinypic.com/2vt73nb.jpg) instead of the large fold-over ones. Some ""collared moto"" styles will add a [small collar] (http://i.imgur.com/QHSC3l.jpg) while still keeping the minimalist design. Because of the minimalist design this jacket has a less ""edgy"" look and is a lot more versatile. This jacket can be a [great addition](http://cdn.styleforum.net/c/c4/c460af5c_IMG_0022crop.jpeg) to any [street casual style](http://goo.gl/ESvcT) or even equally great with a [business casual look](http://goo.gl/nDNtp).
* **Peacoat** Just like they sound. A peacoat style jacket [but in leather](http://i.imgur.com/sNEmcIO.jpg). I would stay away from these because the traditional peacoat is a wool jacket (sometimes with leather trim) and these leather versions are not as versatile as the wool. They were popular a few years back and are generally aimed at a little dressier look and would not work as well with a completely casual outfit. Still acceptable if you have your heart set on one but a nice wool peacoat may serve you better in the long run.
* **Fencing Jacket** An aggressively cut jacket designed similarly after fencing jackets. Usually only reserved goth ninja styles and will definitely not be as versatile as the jackets above.
* **Varsity and Baseball** These are casual jackets that can have either leather only sleeves or be all leather. Because the all leather versions are generally made in suede these are a lot less expensive than many of the jackets above and can be a great addition to a casual wardrobe for a [street inspired style](http://goo.gl/p7vYg).
* **Trench Coat** Just like it sounds. A trench coat made of leather that will be long and used as an overcoat. CAUTION: Unless you really know what you're doing and are going for a [Goth Ninja look](http://img163.imageshack.us/img163/7914/dsc0218k.jpg), I would avoid these at all costs. Society currently frowns on these since they hold connotations of [nerds who think they](http://www.comparestoreprices.co.uk/images/unbranded/f/unbranded-full-length-leather-trench-coat.jpg) [are in the Matrix](http://www.eshopone.com/images/leather-jackets/leather-trench-coat/560/leather-trench-coat.jpg) and American kids that shoot up schools.

**Leather Quality**
-Because leather is one of the strongest and most durable materials you can use for apparel, just like in shoes, quality leather can last you decades and will continue to look better as it breaks in. Always look for high quality **Full Grain** leather, just like in nice shoes. Durability and quality is the #1 reason why you do not skimp on your leather purchase. When looking at leather jackets one of your major considerations is what type of leather it is made of and the thickness of the leather. Unfortunately, this is one of those scenarios that the better stuff is usually way more expensive. The list below can serve as an intro to the most popular leather types, but is by no means an exhaustive list: 

* **Cowhide, Steerhide, and HorseHide** - All stiff types that are designed to be heavy and durable. These will last you eons, but may not be as supple to the touch. [Cow Example](http://www.uswings.com/images/cowhide_swatch.jpg) [Horse](http://www.uswings.com/images/horsehide_swatch.jpg)

* **Calf skin** similar to cowhide but slightly softer. Meant to be broken in and is still considered heavy.

* **Lamb** Very light and soft type of leather. The feeling of this will almost feel like cloth or silk like. Many people may not even believe it's leather because of it's soft hand feel. [Example](http://www.uswings.com/images/lambskin_swatch.jpg)

* **Goat** Softer than calf, but not as soft as lamb. Will be much more porous and heavy grain. Very good versatile all around type of leather. [Example](http://www.uswings.com/images/goatskin_swatch.jpg)

* **Buffalo and Bison** more heavy leather types. Used for protection and functionality. Will last eons.

If you go into a comment thread where the most upvoted comment to a ""Did I do this right?"" is a simple ""No"" and you have nothing to add then consider leaving proper feedback or move on. Not even your mother is interested in your uninspired and predominantly unwitty remarks.

Or, you could spend a moment to give precise feedback, think for yourselves and stop jerking to the thought that you understand clothes now that you've spent time on MFA. Self censor when you have nothing constructive to add to the conversation and speak with your upvotes, and more importantly as *definitelynotaspy* mentioned, your downvotes. Downvote the one word responses that don't add anything. Make this a better community.

In the past MFA was full or lurkers who would only speak up after a long stint of doing just that, lurking. Now every man and his dog has a supposed ""opinion"" on what looks good and what doesn't. And yet none of them can explain why. 

There are so many things to consider when judging clothes, which I think many people overlook. You have to consider proportion, colour, personality, body shape, height, skin tone, everything. See how much there is to delve into? It isn't that hard to come up with something creative and unique to add to a post by choosing just one or two of those keys when thinking of a response.

**tl;dr** If you don't have any proper constructive criticism to add, or can't take the time to do so then take a note from Helen Keller's book and do yourself and everyone else a favour, shut the fuck up.

It's basically a stock response for newcomers who ask which pair of shoes from DSW to buy.   However, there's much less advice about how to do it *well*.  That should be rectified, eh?  This thread started as a comment [in this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/1jf506/purchasing_used_aes_on_ebay/) , and thanks to a bunch of folks over there for suggestion improvements and extensions.  I added quite a bit onto the original comment, and I think it's a much more comprehensive guide now.

Here's what I'd look for, in no particular order.  *(Note that 90% of this information is relevant for buying other high-end shoes on ebay too, although the suggestions for models, prices, and recrafting aren't necessarily correct for Aldens, vintage Florsheims, etc.)*

 * **Model.**  AE makes a lot of stinkers, so don't take the brand name as a guarantee that you're getting good-looking, stylish shoes.  Avoid square-toes, kiltie tassels ,moc-toes, and bicycle stitching, to name a few.  It's probably easier to say what to look *for* - classic models, even if they have different names the the current line-up.  Strands, Park Avenues, Fifth Avenues, MacNeils, McAllisters, Player's Shoes, Kenilworths, Kenwoods, and Waldens are all good options - in other words, simple captoe balmorals, plain-toe bluchers, wingtips, longwings, and penny loafers.  

 * **Sizing.**  AE sells shoes in [quite a few different lasts (the overall shape of the shoe)](http://www.allenedmonds.com/aeonline/AllAboutLastsView?catalogId=40000000001&amp;langId=-1&amp;storeId=1) in addition to the traditional sizes and widths (from narrow AAA through extra-wide EEE).  If you don't know your size,  you can use [AE's at-home guide](http://www.allenedmonds.com/aeonline/TheFitRightView?catalogId=40000000001&amp;langId=-1&amp;storeId=1) or go to any shoe store in the world and measure yourself on a Brannock device.  If you're new to buying shoes sized by width (instead of the middle-of-the-road D that most big-box shoes are sold in), it's extra important to get your measurements.  If you measure 12C, then a pair of 12AA Strands will strangle your feet and a 12E pair will have them rattling around.  If you measure above or below average in width or length, there's good and bad news.  The good news is that auctions for your size will be less competitive and the final bids will be lower.  The bad news is that your size will show up far less often than average lengths and widths.  Those of you with 10D feet can invert the good and bad news.

 * **Condition of the uppers**.  You want shoes that were conditioned regularly and stored with trees.  Look for minimal creasing and absolutely zero cracks or tears in the leather.  Also keep an eye out for stains, spots and discoloration, especially on the toes (where things were most likely to drip *and* the stains will be most noticeable).  [Here are a few pairs in really good shape.  This should be your goal.](http://imgur.com/a/cQsvv)

 * **Condition of the insole and lining**.  Again, avoid anything with cracks or tears.  If the logo printed on the insole is worn away, that's a sign the shoes have seen a lot of wear.  [These two pairs look totally acceptable](http://imgur.com/a/kCfc0), while [this pair is on the verge of being too worn out to consider buying (depending on the condition of the uppers and soles).](http://i.imgur.com/bgVggAm.jpg)  When there are so many available, there's no reason not to hold out for a lightly-worn pair. Like many better shoes, AEs are constructed with a cork footbed that slowly takes on the shape of your foot.  A well-worn shoe's footbed will be so compressed by the previous owner that they may never feel comfortable.  However, [AE's $125 recrafting/resoling process includes a new set of cork footbeds](http://www.allenedmonds.com/aeonline/RecraftingView?storeId=1&amp;langId=-1&amp;catalogId=40000000001), so that may or may not be a deal-breaker for you.

 * **Condition of the soles and heels**.  Don't worry about the forefoot being scratched slightly. [ As a recent thread on MFA demonstrated](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/1j9f7r/is_this_normal_for_first_day_wear_with_leather/), that's something that happens the first few wears.  What you want to watch out for are soles that are ready to be replaced, *unless* you're getting a great pair so inexpensively that the [$125 recrafting/resoling charge from AE](http://www.allenedmonds.com/aeonline/RecraftingView?storeId=1&amp;langId=-1&amp;catalogId=40000000001) still makes them worth it.  For me, that would have to be shell cordovan for under $100.  [Here are some soles that are ready for a replacement](http://imgur.com/a/5B6Na).  The hole in the top layer of leather and the welt stitching being ground down so far it's invisible are both signs that you should either pass on the auction or mentally include the cost of recrafting/resoling.  [These, on the other hand, still have a ton of life left in them.](http://imgur.com/a/EhUoW)   To reiterate, don't let superficial scratching scare you away, but be wary of soles that are worn through.

 * **Secret shell**.  Go back to [this pair of longwings I posted earlier.](http://i.imgur.com/LLN7amu.jpg)  They're made from shell cordovan, which is very special, high-quality leather made from horses' asses.  Most sellers know when they have shell shoes and price them accordingly, but once in a while, they don't and you can pick up a pair for an absolute steal.  You've got to know what to look for for though.  The biggest tell-tale signs are (1) the color, which is often a purply-red on older shoes (but not always, especially on newer shoes), (2) a distinct puckering around the eyelets which occurs because shell is much thicker than calf leather, and (3) creasing on the forefoot that looks more like large gentle waves than small wrinkles. [Here's a beautiful pair that shows all three characteristics.](http://i.imgur.com/Rb0C7Yl.jpg) If the model number inside the shoe is still visible in the auction listing, it's often possible to match it with a list of known shell models. [ The ""Shell or Not Shell"" thread on AAAC has been running for about four years, and it's the best resource for learning to spot secret shell.](http://www.askandyaboutclothes.com/forum/showthread.php?100929-Everybody-s-favorite-game-Shell-or-Not-Shell-\(Warning-Big-Pics\)/page59) [Shell is gorgeous, and as this image from Nick Horween's blog shows, it's worth the treasure hunt.](http://i.imgur.com/D0rvajX.jpg)

 * **Price, including shipping cost**.  Even AEs in really shitty shape go for $30-40, so don't expect thrift store prices on ebay.  There's just too much competition and too many idiots bidding based on brand name.  Don't be one of them.  If the uppers and inners are in good shape and the soles have minor and acceptable wear, you should be willing to pay $75-100 for a used pair.  You can get factory seconds (with minor blemishes or stitching errors) for around $150 regularly ([sometimes even $125](http://www.reddit.com/r/frugalmalefashion/comments/1jdwdf/allen_edmonds_seconds_sale/)), so don't overpay for used shoes.  Watch out for ridiculous shipping costs too, especially if the price seems too good to be true.  Shipping a pair of shoes with insurance and delivery confirmation should never be more than $15-20 (unless it's crossing an international border).  

 * **Using Ebay Effectively**.  [PTO's general ebay guide](http://putthison.com/post/318472789/clothesshoppingonebay) is absolutely worth reading, but I want to draw attention to three super useful tools.  (1) [Saved searches](http://pages.ebay.com/help/buy/save-searches.html) will save you the hassle of scrolling through the listings every day.   Be as specific as you can be to separate the wheat from the chaff, but I would *strongly* suggest adding additional saved searches for common alternate and misspellings.  If you find an auction for a pair of ""Alan Edmonds"" or ""Allen Edmunds"", you may be one of the lucky few who stumbled across it.   Note that you can use boolean operators in your saved searches, which will help you find listings by both model name (""MacNeil"") and description (""wingtips"").  (2) Using a sniping service like [Gixen](http://www.gixen.com/index.php) will let you bid at the absolute last second and avoid some of the bidding wars that artificially drive up the final price.  (3) [Search completed auctions](http://pages.ebay.com/tr/en-us/completedlistings/) to get a sense of what your model and size have been selling for recently.  [This search for Park Aves in my size](http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_sacat=0&amp;_from=R40&amp;_nkw=allen+edmonds+park+ave+12d&amp;LH_Complete=1&amp;rt=nc) tells me that if I want a pair in a reddish-brown like merlot/cognac/burgundy, I can be patient and expect to win an auction for around $65-75.

★★**Important note:  It may take some time to find shoes in the size, quality, and price you're looking for.**★★  

If you don't need shoes in a hurry, that's no problem.  If your internship starts on Monday or you have a wedding this weekend, this guide probably isn't for you (at least not yet).  But do yourself a favor and look for good shoes ahead of time so you're not in an emergency-buying situation.

1340809257.0,368,self.malefashionadvice,vor0m,Beginner shirt guide,433,65,65,http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/vor0m/beginner_shirt_guide/,"For this guide, I’m going to ignore T-shirts, polo shirts, and henleys and focus only on traditional button ups. There is already a t-shirt guide on the sidebar that does a great job discussing those, and henleys and polos are fairly casual shirts and, at least in most cases, can be worn just like a t-shirt. I’m also going to skip over fit (shujin has written an amazing fit guide [here](http://redd.it/ehrtv) that covers shirt fit extensively and better than I ever could) and ties (guide on the sidebar [here](http://redd.it/scpbb)). 

A lot of this stuff is going to seem really basic to some people, but there have been a couple requests for a guide, so here it is. 

With that being said, let’s talk button ups.

**Material**

The material of a button up is important when deciding on which shirt you want to wear. A flannel button up is not going to be fun to wear in the middle of a Georgia summer, while you aren’t going to want to wear linen during a Michigan winter. Button ups are made from a variety of different materials, and this list by no means covers all of them, but these are the main ones.

* 
[Seersucker](http://i.imgur.com/NvW65.jpg) - Seersucker shirts are a summer staple, particularly in the Southern USA. Seersucker is characterized by a lightweight cotton that is intentionally puckered; this rumpled effect allows easy airflow and makes it one of the coolest fabrics to make clothing out of. Seersucker is normally a casual fabric, and while some people wear them in business casual situations, seersucker shirts are not a traditional dress shirt. You generally don’t wear a tie with a seersucker shirt.

* 
[Linen](http://i.imgur.com/goYFW.jpg) - This is one of the most lightweight fabrics that button ups are made out of. It is very breathable, incredibly smooth and will get softer the more it is worn and washed. One downside to linen is that, because it is so lightweight, it is often times a little bit see through. If this is a problem, you can always wear an undershirt (v-neck of course, don’t want a collar showing). Linen is normally relegated to warm weather wear, but during the summer months people wear it both formally and casually. Ties can work with linen shirts, but it is somewhat rare. 

* 
[Flannel](http://i.imgur.com/hVnsZ.jpg) – This is one of the heavier fabrics you can get a shirt made out of. Usually fairly soft, they only get softer the more they are worn. Flannel is almost always worn casually and in cold weather. The large majority of flannel shirts have a plaid pattern to them. You should rarely, if ever, wear a tie with a flannel shirt.

* 
[Oxford Cloth](http://i.imgur.com/rGDZX.jpg) - This is probably the most versatile fabric that men’s shirts are made out of. Oxford cloth is normally a heavy fabric, woven from alternating white and blue yarn. The quintessential ‘all purpose’ shirt, an OCBD should be the go-to shirt for most people. Many people will tell you that you shouldn’t wear a tie with an OCBD, but IMO it is acceptable with a sport coat or blazer. If you plan on wearing a suit, you should go for a shirt that is more formal.

* 
[Pinpoint](http://i.imgur.com/zxMHa.jpg) – Pinpoint is somewhat of a combination between Oxford cloth and Broadcloth. It utilizes the same weave as oxford cloth, but uses finer yarns like a broadcloth. The result is a fabric that works both formally and casually, and is a great option if you want a shirt that is very versatile. Pinpoints are heavier than broadcloth, but lighter than oxford; they will also appear ‘crisper’ than an oxford cloth. Ties are perfectly acceptable with pinpoint shirts.

* 
[Broadcloth/Poplin]( http://i.imgur.com/v4Ibj.jpg) – There are slight differences between Broadcloth and Poplin, but they are basically the same and many people switch the name interchangeably. This fabric is tightly woven which leads to a very smooth fabric, much smoother than oxford cloth or pinpoint. Because of this, broadcloth is a more formal fabric and is rarely considered casual. Ties are fine with broadcloth.

* 
[Twill](http://i.imgur.com/FmlLP.jpg) – Twills have a diagonal weave to them and are because of this are often less likely to wrinkle. They are also fairly soft fabric. The weight can vary and it’s a fabric that can work both casually and formally. Ties work with twills.

There are other fabrics that shirts are made out of (Madras, Chambray, etc.) but that should cover the majority of the ones you’ll see. 

[edit]kjetha posted a great comparison image [here](http://i.imgur.com/aLUOm.jpg)

**Colors and Matching**

A general rule for shirt colors is that the lighter the color, the more formal it is; the darker the color, the more casual. This works for tones as well. White, light blue, light pink, and most pastels are usually business appropriate. Dark blues, reds, maroon, neons, and black should be kept for more casual occasions. 

Another general rule to follow is to keep your shirt lighter (or a similar shade) than your pants. Ie: black dress pants and a white shirt or khaki chinos and a pastel blue shirt look good most of the time, khaki chinos and a black shirt can have issues.

Finally, it is often difficult to wear a shirt that is a similar color to your jacket. It can be done, but to be safe always wear a shirt that has some contrast to your jacket (ie. A dark blue shirt may not look good with a navy blazer, but a white or pink shirt will).

Now, the problem is, many shops (ie: ASOS, Karmaloop, etc.) offer good deals, but by the time you add on international shipping, plus duties and taxes the deals aren't really worth it any more. So, with this guide, I think it'd be a good idea to limit it to either brick and mortar stores that are common in Canada or online stores that ship out from Canada, thus eliminating duties and whatnot. Here's an example of what I figure would be a good layout for things, maybe just put some details, what's good, what isn't etc. This is my first time doing this, so if anyone has any additions just let me know and I'll add it to the OP.

EDIT: I'll be updating this with quality posts in the comments. I dunno what the mods want to do, but this would probably be useful in the Shopping Advice part of the sidebar (not to toot my own horn). Maybe other people could make guides for the UK, Australia, whatever has enough interest.

[**Old Navy/GAP/Banana Republic**](http://oldnavy.gapcanada.ca)

Low to moderate prices. Both online and physical stores. 

They are technically different stores, but they all are under the same name and one website houses them all. Both in terms of quality and price, Old Navy&lt;Gap&lt;Banana Republic. Old Navy can be good for cheap basics, but not too much more, imo. Their fits can be a bit large and boxy. Gap and BR are good, but their regular prices are a bit high for the quality, if you can get good sales they're worth it. Shipping is great with them in Canada, free with orders over $50 and free returns. I've dealt with them before and it's gone well.

[**Club Monaco**](http://www.clubmonaco.ca/) 

Mid range pricing. Online and physical. Free shipping over $150, inexpensive otherwise

Great sales, *everything* eventually gets marked down so if there's something you like there's a good chance that you can get it at a fraction of the cost if you're a bit patient. Definitely worth checking a real store if there's one near you, better deals and an unadvertised 20% student discount.

[**Rooney**](http://www.rooneyshop.com/) 

Based in Montreal. They carry mid-high brands. Free shipping on all orders.

[**Tate and Yoko**](http://tateandyoko.com/) 

Also based in Montreal. Carry mostly premium denim lines. $5 shipping. No refunds though, returns are only for store credit. Womp.

[**J Crew**](http://www.jcrew.com/index.jsp)

Mid range pricing. Physical and online. Ships to Canada for 9.95 flat rate, duty and tax included when you checkout, so no surprises when you checkout. 

[**Zara**](http://www.zara.com/ca/) 

Fast-fashion, along the lines of H&amp;M but a little nicer. The store has opened their ecommerce site, seems like they have better selection to what they offer in store.

[**H&amp;M**](http://www.hm.com/ca/) 

No online shopping, but many large cities have at least one. Many on here tend to be torn on H&amp;M. They offer cheap, mostly good looking items (fast-fashion kind of thing), and the fit is usually good but the quality can be hit and miss. I like them for the most part, and they're good for experimenting with new looks before you go and drop big coin on a nice piece.

[**SSense**](http://www.ssense.com) 

High fashion, designer stuff mainly. Some cool stuff, but too expensive or too out there for most on here, I'd guess.

[**JM**](http://www.jm.ca/) 

Made in Canada underwear. They sent me an item with the security tags with them still attached and sent me a replacement for free, for the inconvenience. Good customer service. 

[**Four Horsemen**](http://www.fourhorsemen.ca/) 

Mid-high pricing, nicer stuff. Based out of Victoria BC. Free shipping over $200, 10 bucks otherwise. No returns, only exchanges or store credit.

[**Frank and Oak**](http://www.frankandoak.com/)

A different route. Invite only, low-mid tier, mainly basics and such. Free shipping both ways (I think they're out of Montreal?), so no big risk. I've heard mainly good from them.

[**The Bay**](http://www.thebay.com/)

Canadian Macy's, essentially. Carry all the main brands, Ralph Lauren, Levi's, Kenneth Cole, etc. Prices a bit high, but frequent sales. I quite like their Hudson Room brand.

[**LL Bean**](http://www.llbean.com/) 

Talked about often on MFA, especially for their shoes. Free shipping, good quality for the price generally.

[**Joe Fresh**](http://www.joefresh.com/en/) 

Inexpensive basics. Available in Superstores and some independent JF stores (Vancouver has one I know). Good fit, simple designs, definitely worth having a look. I like their t-shirts a lot, better than H&amp;M imo.

[**RW&amp;Co**](http://www.rw-co.com/) 

Online and in-store. Classic, often semi-formal styles with more youthful cuts. Mid range pricing, worth it if you get things on sale. Their shirting and ties are quite nice.

[**Nomad**](http://www.nomadshop.net/) 

Based in Toronto. Mainly nicer designer things (APC, Comme Des Garcon, Wings + Horns). Fairly expensive. Shipping is kinda pricey even in Canada, but if you can afford stuff here, an extra $15 probably won't break the bank.

[**Haven**](http://havenshop.ca/) 

Similar to Nomad, though they seem to carry a wider variety of brands, from  Arc'teryx Veilance and LVC to Converse and Adidas.

[**Revolve Clothing**](http://www.revolveclothing.com/)

A lot of designer things, wide selection in denim. Many popular brands on MFA are carried here, such as Common Projects, Naked and Famous, 3Sixteen. Rather pricey, but they seem to have a lot of sale items at any given time. Free shipping to Canada.

[**Off The Hook**](http://othshop.ca/)

Montreal based, seem to carry a lot of streetwear and that style. Free shipping over $99",,False,self,t5_2r65t,1376431828.0,,,True,t3_1fwezp,http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/1fwezp/guide_to_canadian_shopping/,

I hope it helps!

**The basics**

* Batch similar colours to cut down on loads.  T-shirts and shirts can be washed together. Have a mix of underwear colours so no matter what you're washing you always have underwear.
* A front-loader washing machine is far gentler on your clothes than a top-loader.  Hand washing is best, but hey, who has time.  (Bonus: front-loaders are usually more efficient in water/power usage and better for the environment)
* Use less detergent than recommended - past a point more detergent doesn't mean cleaner, it just builds up in your clothes.
* Just because it doesn't smell, doesn't mean it isn't dirty
* The only items that should ever go in the dryer are underwear, socks, and possibly undershirts.  Everything else should be hung to dry. Get a cheap fold-out clothes rack to dry your clothes on.
* Tumble dryers are brutal on clothes - even on delicate settings they are too hot for most items, and the tumbling will wear out the clothes very quickly.  All that lint collected in the filters?  That's the fabrics wearing down.
* Never dry clothes in the sun (except for whites) - it will bleach the colours very quickly.
* Dry cleaning is very harsh on your clothes, try to keep it to the minimum


**Socks and underwear**

* Socks and underwear should be washed after every wear, no exceptions.
* Washed on warm cycles (30 C, 80ish F)
* Can be dried using a dryer - these are the only items you should ever consider using a dryer - everything else should be hung to dry.



**T-shirts, undershirts, sweat shirts and polo shirts**

* T-shirts, undershirts and polo shirts - basically anything very close to you skin - should be washed after every wear, again, no exception.
* Sweatshirts can be washed infrequently, assuming you're wearing them over a t-shirt, after every 5 or more wears.  This is solely dependent on how they're treated and how dirty you think they're getting.
* They will usually be ok with warm water (polo shirts may need a cold cycle)
* Gently pull them into shape before hang drying or flat drying for sweatshirts.


**Dress/business/button-down shirts**

* Should be washed after every wear.  If you wear undershirts they can be worn 2 to 4 times before washing, depending on what sort of treatment they get while being worn, what sort of environment you wear them in.
* A good quality shirt, treated well, should last hundreds of wears and washes.
* Washed  on the most gentle cycle in cold water.  Hand washing is better, but time consuming.  Some guides say that shirts should be put in a delicates bag to protect the collar points and cuffs, I've never found that necessary.
* Shirts should only ever be dried on a wood hanger to keep the shape - Ikea hangers are great for this. Never user a wire hanger - you will ruin the shape of your shirts.
* Under no circumstances have them dry cleaned, but laundered is OK, although they will not last as long if you send them out for laundering.
* If your business shirts start to get stained around the collar, a bi-carb of soda paste massaged into the collar and left for 10 mins works, other methods use a vinegar and liquid detergent mixture.
* If your underarms get a build-up that smells when you wear them, dipping the underarms in a 50/50 cloudy ammonia/water mixture and letting it sit for 10 mins is good for this. This also works well for t-shirts.
* NEVER re-iron dress/business shirts after wearing them once - you're cooking the sweat, dirt, dust etc. into the fabric and significantly increasing the likelihood it will smell after a short time. Ironing a shirt is not the same as washing it - it doesn't clean it.


**Jumpers/sweaters/cardigans/knits**

* Anything wool should generally be dry-cleaned, unless it explicitly says machine wash
* Then, only on cold, gentle settings, with a slow spin.  Or even better hand wash (but never wring them out)
* Use a gentle detergent designed for wool.
* Knits should be gently pulled into shape, if required, then dried flat (that is, horizontally), either on a fold out drying rack even better on a pop-up mesh rack.  [These can be bought very cheaply](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_i_0_10?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=mesh+drying+rack&amp;x=0&amp;y=0&amp;sprefix=mesh+dryin%2Caps%2C362).
* Never ever ever put these in a dryer.


**Anything silk**

* Extra gentle hand wash in cold water, with a very mild detergent.
* Hang dry only
* Dry cleaning is generally out of the question, unless you go to a specialist cleaner


**Jeans/chinos**

* Jeans/cotton chinos should be washed every 4 to 8 or so wears (you be the judge) or if the knees are starting to stretch out.  Cold wash only.
* Exception - raw denim should not be washed, but soaked every 6 months to a year or even longer.
* Hang dry only.


**Linen suits/trousers**

* Linen trousers can be hand washed, cold only with a gentle detergent, or dry cleaned very occasionally.  Hang dry only.
* Spot treatments on light coloured linen will show, so use with caution 
* Linen suits should be dry cleaned only very infrequently (eg once a year).  Even thought you might be washing the trousers, have the trousers and coat dry cleaned together, so if there is any fade from the dry cleaning you don't end up with a mis-matched suit.
* Especially with light weight linens, dry cleaning will wear them out very quickly.


**Suits**

* Suits should be dry cleaned only and very occasionally - usually once a year is enough, possibly more for lighter coloured suits.
* Steamed gently in between for shape/wrinkles and the pants pressed for creases.  Hanging in a steamy bathroom is a good method if you don't have a steamer.
* You shouldn't wear a suit two days in a row - after you wear it it should be hung on a good quality hanger (to keep the shape), gently brushed and aired for a day or two.
* If you press the pants yourself, don't iron directly on the fabric, it will go shiny - use a damp ironing cloth
* If any suit claims it is machine washable, you should not be wearing it in the first place. Burn it.

This is a big long infographic-type thing that is automatically generated from the survey. One note: when it generates the infographic, it doesn't round figures, just cuts them off. So when you see things like 98% Male, 1% female, 0% other, the true numbers were 98.06% male, 1.72% female, .22% other. For those of you wondering why occasionally the graphs will only add up to 99%, that's why. Yeah, it's dumb. I can break out the sig figs if you *really* want them.

**Favorite brands** are all over the place. [Wordcloud](http://i.imgur.com/XQuUxOn.jpg)


**Income** was skewed heavily by students, so here's a chart of income with students removed. Looks pretty standard. [Graph](http://i.imgur.com/G37994E.jpg)


**Top 10 industries (non-student)**

1. Technical (e.g., architect, engineer, scientist) (7.93%)
2. IT (5.42%)

8. Education (1.94%)
9. Medical	(1.76%)
10. Not currently employed (1.70%)



CCs were sent the same survey, but with a custom variable append so we could pull out some differences. A couple interesting notes from looking at that:

- On the rate your fashion knowledge question, MFA in general rated themselves at 53.38 out of 100. CCs rated themselves at 62.69.

- Only 18.10% of MFA memebers post on WAYWT/Outfit Feedback &amp; Fit Check. 56.86% of CCs do.

- Only 13.59% of MFA members have bought an item MTM. 49.02% of CCs have. 39.12% of MFAers don't know what MTM is.

- CCs are way more likely to own ToJ (7.75% vs. 1.09%) , CPs (8.45% vs. 1.38%) or Uniqlo OCBDS (16.20% vs. 9.60%)

- CCs are way more likely to own raw denim than the average MFAer (80.39% vs. 37.42%)

- CCs want MFA to go self-post only more than the general population (57.69% vs. 22.46%)

So I put together a $500 Expansion Kit that assumes you have [the basics](http://redd.it/mu2zu) covered, but would like to branch out from there. A little bolder, a little less traditional, but still focused on versatility and value. 

This particular kit focuses on rugged outdoor spring/summer style - camping, hiking, or walking around the city looking like a camping trip might break out at any moment.  Out of everything I've ever posted on MFA, this is the closest to my own style.  

It's eight items, all of which can be worn with just about everything else in the kit, which means there's something like two dozen different combinations here. Add it to the spring/summer staples you already have and it's an incredibly versatile, non-boring wardrobe.

 * [New Balance H710 mid-top hiking shoes](http://tinyurl.com/7qu42hs), $100 and free shipping.  Lighter-weight, more versatile alternative to [real hiking boots](http://www.lowaboots.com/catalog/catalog.cfm?Category=3&amp;Type=M).  Grey/grey is my favorite color for these, but you can also find them in [navy nubuck](http://newbalance-online.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;products_id=216), [tan/navy](http://tinyurl.com/76wewj4), and [light tan](http://tinyurl.com/6nr9z3s).  Bonus points for [red or blue laces.](http://tinyurl.com/73qmcby)

 * [Bean blucher mocs](http://www.llbean.com/llb/shop/65129?feat=505906-GN3), $69 and free shipping.  [Also available in mainline LL Bean](http://www.llbean.com/llb/shop/11575?feat=65129-ppodxs&amp;dds=y) (I don't like the soles of these as much, but the uppers are the same).  [A footwear legend](http://sartoriallyinclined.blogspot.com/2009/09/revisited-ll-bean-blucher-mocs.html), and more versatile than boat shoes, imo.  GQ's Creative Director: ""L.L.Bean created its now classic Blucher Moc in 1936. The idea was to give Maine dwellers a casual shoe that would help their feet withstand the state’s damp and often unpredictable climate. Today its untrendy status is what makes it so desirable. Of-the-moment menswear designers like Tim Hamilton and Michael Bastian love to wear them, as do their models. And why wouldn’t they? They’re virtually indestructible and can be worn every day of the year, with bare feet or the thickest of wool socks.""

 * [Two pairs of Patagonia Stand-Up Shorts](http://www.amazon.com/Patagonia-Stand-Up-Short-Mens/dp/B002S1BC9M), $110 and free super-saver/prime shipping.  These have been around forever, and they never seem to go on sale.  7"" inseam is the safe option, believe it or not - [go 5"" if you're bold enough](http://www.amazon.com/Patagonia-Mens-Stand-Up-Shorts/dp/B0034JW7FK/ref=pd_sim_sg_1).  The short inseam is purely functional - if you're using these for their intended purpose (hiking, climbing, etc), you want the range of movement that a short inseam offers.  

 * [Snap-front down vest](http://www.landsend.com/pp/mens-down-vest~234304_-1.html?bcc=y&amp;action=order_more&amp;sku_0=::TVY&amp;CM_MERCH=IDX_overstocks-_-men-_-outerwear&amp;origin=index), $25 and free shipping.  Another classic, great for layering or chilly spring mornings/evenings.  

 * [Lightweight pullover anorak](http://www.llbean.com/llb/shop/73093?feat=anorak-SR0), $50 and free shipping.  Lightweight, easy to roll up and stow when the rain stops or the day warms up.  If you're willing to go a little over budget, I really like the Penfield [Holbrook](http://www.penfieldusa.com/us/holbrook-green.html) (pullover) and [Gibson](http://www.penfieldusa.com/us/gibson-heritage-blue.html) (zip-up) as alternatives.

 * [Heather grey sweatshirt](http://store.archivalclothing.com/products/columbiaknit-sweatshirt), $85 plus shipping.  This is an easy place to buy a made-in-the-US option with better fit, materials and construction for not a lot more than super-cheap Hanes options.  [Lands' End recently came out with an even less expensive US-made option](http://www.landsend.com/pp/mens-made-in-usa-sweatshirt%7E233649_-1.html?bcc=y&amp;action=order_more&amp;sku_0=::CLN&amp;CM_MERCH=search-_-sweatshirt&amp;origin=search), but I can vouch for the fit and materials of Archival's.  [Left Field NYC has a bunch too.](http://www.leftfieldnyc.net/category/sweats)  

 * [Marled wool-blend hiking socks](http://www.amazon.com/Wigwam-Merino-Comfort-Length-Charcoal/dp/B000TA741O/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1331089553&amp;sr=8-1), $15 shipped for two pair.  Shorts, hiking boots and marled hiking socks is a beautiful, functional combination.

 * [Kelty 18L daypack](http://www.amazon.com/Kelty-25641911RD-18-Liter-Daypack-Red/dp/B004CXACMW/ref=sr_1_1?s=apparel&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1331224109&amp;sr=1-1), $42 with free super-saver/prime shipping. Mid-sized backpack to store water and unneeded layers as you shed them during the day.  Or an ipad.  It really depends where you're wearing this stuff, right?

**Total = $496**

I want to reiterate that this kit assumes you have the spring/summer basics covered. If you don't already have lightweight chinos in neutral colors, khaki shorts, cheap t-shirts/polos, boat shoes, plimsolls, etc, etc, etc, then those are a priority over all this nonsense.

**That said, two things to note -**

1.    Branching out from the basics is about building your own aesthetic, so take these suggestions as my opinion. If this doesn't fit your style and you want to put together your own $500 Expansion Kit, please, please do. I'd love to see other iterations of this idea, and they'd be good for the community.

Let's recap: swoodge spends the time to put together a *personal* inspiration album, only for the top comments to lambaste him for not picking clothes/looks/models that they like. It was so frustrating I thought I would take a stab at responding to some common complaints and perhaps shedding some light on the purpose of inspiration albums.

***What is an inspiration album for?***

This should be obvious, but the point is to inspire. No more, no less. ""Inspire"" is a general term that means different things to different people. However, and this is very important:

**The point is not to dress or look exactly like the models in the photos.**

The fact that some people think this boggles my mind. Firstly, the point of fashion is to develop your own style to some degree, not obsessively recreate pictures in a lookbook (even if such a thing were possible, which it usually isn't). You don't have to have look anything like the model or even like the outfit he's wearing to at least try to appreciate one or two aspects of the outfit that you may not have thought of on your own.

If any particular look doesn't appeal to you, that's fine. Hell, if any particular *album* doesn't appeal to you, that's fine too. But don't be so closed-minded as to think that no one else could possibly get something out of it.

***But I'm not skinny/European/effeminate/whatever!***

OK, we get it, you squat like crazy and are bigger than the average fashion model. So are most people! Doesn't mean you can't find something to admire in the outfit, whether it's the color combination, fabrics, layering, shoes, or a million other things. Are you too built to wear shoes? No, you're not. Get over yourself, and say something constructive or STFU.

***Do people really dress like this? I just wear jeans and t-shirts and get tons of pussy lol. Faggots.***

What the hell are you doing here? Reddit Enhancement Suite lets you filter subreddits out of r/all. Please do that and go away.

And just to reiterate: *We don't dress like the people in fashion shoots.* (Well, for the most part.) It's like watching porn, you don't necessarily want to re-enact every step. 

Well, that's enough ranting for now. Anything I missed? ",,False,self,t5_2r65t,False,,,True,t3_14e4g3,http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/14e4g3/a_note_on_inspiration_albums/,

1347192723.0,346,self.malefashionadvice,zlkto,Annoucement: New policy on interactions between companies and the MFA subreddit,428,82,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/zlkto/annoucement_new_policy_on_interactions_between/,"Hey everyone,

Since Kalium and I started this place over three years ago, we've seen some substantial changes in the community and in reddit as a whole. Recently, we've seen pretty substantial figures and organizations begin to use reddit as a tool to reach out to the community as a whole. In particular for MFA, we've had the CEO of Allen Edmonds as well as a writer for Esquire talk with us in a professional capacity, and we'd like to continue this trend.

We're hoping to implement a general policy that outlines acceptable conduct for these cases that we can use for future reference. It'll speed up the setup time and allow some unique contributions to the subreddit. In doing so, though, we're not providing any official endorsement, nor are we allowing the posting of sales or anything else considered unacceptable for the subreddit or spam. What we're instead hoping for is community members that provide content and contribute to the subreddit within a professional capacity.

That said, here is the policy on such an interaction.

* Individuals acting on behalf of a company will receive special flair identifying them as such.
* Said individuals must comply with all posting guidelines as expected of anyone else.
* Said individuals may make one initial posting acting as a combined introduction/AMA
* In order to receive this flair/permission, individuals must contact the moderators in advance from a verifiable source in an official capacity. 

For example, if Mr. William Denimvest, CEO of the Denimvest Clothing Co. made an account, he could message the moderators about contributing to the subreddit on behalf of Denimvest Clothing. We say ""okay, but follow the rules,"" and give them user flair stating ""CEO, Denimvest Clothing"". The fellow posts an AMA once and then acts like any other MFA member.

We're hoping this will act similarly to the panelist system of /r/AskScience and the moderator-approved IAMA posts. Ideally this will provide a broader spectrum of fashion advice and style information to our community. 

That said, we are also want to get some feedback from the community, as well, so please give us your thoughts and suggestions on the matter.",,False,self,t5_2r65t,False,,,True,t3_zlkto,http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/zlkto/annoucement_new_policy_on_interactions_between/,moderator

.

Before I start, I would like to say that skin tone isn’t the only factor in determining the color palate one should have. Eye and hair color also play a large role along with season. For the last of those, I point to /u/LiveMethod ‘s great post about [color matching]( http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/15tjgv/livemethods_heroically_enormous_seasonal_color/). I will be giving as many examples as I possibly can when I write these and would love feedback on what you would like to be changed. That being said, I use google for most of my searches and many of the pictures are not of men. That doesn’t really matter too much in the long run, because I’m talking about the skin (mostly), not the features of said person (mostly). When I go over the fashion part, I will try to find male pictures to get the point across.

.

This should be seen as an accessory to fashion and less of a basic guideline because what I’m trying to explain is the difference between a good outfit and a great one.

.

.

**Section 1: What is a Skin Tone and How Do I Find Mine?**

.

For starters, to find your skin tone and complexion, I recommend the test found [here]( http://www.mirabellabeauty.com/skintest). It will tell you your rough complexion and give examples of what does and doesn't work for each tone (see below for tone tests).

.

* Complexion (at least in this guide) is your “whiteness or brownness.” I will describe this in terms of light or dark color of skin.
* Skin Tone (for this guide) will be referring to the undertones present in a person’s skin. Generally, there are many types of undertones ranging from light blues to olives to reds to pinks. In order to simplify this procedure, many people will classify them into three categories, warm, cool and neutral.

.


There are ways to determine skin tone easily. Of these, the easiest (in my opinion) in the

* **Vein Test**. Flip over your arm and examine your veins. Are they bluish, greenish or somewhere in between? If they appear blue, you are likely of cool skin tone. If they are green, warm and if they are in-between, you’re neutral. This should be with natural light.

* The **Sliver/Gold Test** is also simple. Hold up some silver next to your face and some gold. If the gold looks nicer, you’re warm skin toned, if silver, you’re cool and if both, you’re neutral. 

* **Reflection Test** Scrub your face pretty well (don’t rub it raw) and hold a towel that is white around your face and look in a mirror, if the resulting reflection appears yellowy, you’re warm, if it looks blue, you’re cool, if you can’t tell it’s most likely neutral.

.

**Section 2: Cool Skin Tones**

.

Looks like you are sporting [blue]( http://imgur.com/GNYL0dz), [pink]( http://imgur.com/tRmtIq0) or [rosy]( http://imgur.com/sak3lGI) undertones. More examples would be like [this]( http://imgur.com/MXicVEs), [this]( http://imgur.com/DXrmOAp), [this]( http://imgur.com/uGgZz61), [this]( http://imgur.com/mi7FbTg) or [this]( http://imgur.com/kfzwj7F).

.

These people generally look best in [silver]( http://imgur.com/UBTg8Eu), [bold colors]( http://imgur.com/8vXaMhX) (#menswear), [bright whites]( http://imgur.com/ghNXy1v) and when accenting eyes, try going [darker]( http://imgur.com/DrT5T1K) than your eye color. My theory on why the bold colors work nicer is that it [breaks up]( http://imgur.com/b5FtMZs) the [monotony]( http://imgur.com/x7zyMUO) (referencing man second from left who does make up partially with the bright white collared shirt) of the look and really makes more of a statement. 

.

Do not wear [beige]( http://imgur.com/3FOwZZQ) and [a]( http://imgur.com/1NwMkPg) v [o]( http://imgur.com/WEH5PHQ) i [d]( http://imgur.com/Eux1elF) orange. There is always some lee-way with all rules. 

.

If this goes over well, I’ll write a Part 2 detailing warm and neutral skin tones. If that goes over well, I’ll write about tone comparisons, universal colors and color matching.

But today I was at work, and applying sunscreen before I went to lunch, when it occurred to me that the areas where I got stains were the same as where the sleeves and collar touched areas where I put on sunscreen.  So I did a quick Google search, and discovered my hunch was right: The combination of avobenzone, a common ingredient in sunscreen, and hard water (I recently moved to a new place which must have hard water) can cause stains just like I was seeing that only appear after going in the wash.  So, first, a trip to Target to find sunscreen that doesn't have avobenzone, and then another google search revealed the answer to the stains: Bar Keeper's Friend, a household cleaner that I had available.  It took the stains right out and does not seem to have harmed the fabric.  Needless to say, I'm thrilled because it saved several hundreds of dollars worth of shirts.

For example:

&gt;I'm not a snotty, entitled frat boy; boat shoes are not an option for me.

and 

&gt;They look ridiculous, and you look like a douchebag frat-boy when you wear them.

and 

&gt;i get so tired seeing them in every fit, really hate them since they look out of place and forced like on almost everyone.

But you know what?  They're just leather shoes, and they've been around since the 1930s.  Why does the lol-are-you-on-a-boat attitude still persist?  Chuck Taylors are only a few years older, but I've literally *never* seen someone snark about only wearing them on the basketball court.  But it's deeper than that, all bound up with frat guys, preppy guys, douchebags, 80s movie villains, I don't know. I can't think of any other piece of clothing that provokes such an intensely negative reaction (especially from people who would probably otherwise tell you they don't know or care about fashion). 

**Why are boat shoes so loaded with social meaning?**  Why do you think they have this special level of scorn that goes so far beyond ""I don't like how those look and I don't want to wear them""?  

I'm really interested in hearing from folks that used to feel this way and no longer do (or maybe who still do).

Like Schia in the thread on gender, I think the best way to approach this discussion is to think about **social expectations**, where they come from, and how/why they've evolved over time.  

Here's a few things off the top of my head, just to get the ball rolling - 

 * How damaging is the ""fashionable gay man"" stereotype (to men all along the Kinsey scale)?  Since I'm xposting this to FFA, what about the corresponding stereotype for gay women?  

 * If you're being honest with yourself, has the fear of being perceived as gay steered your clothing decisions?

**Style choices I've found useful as a short dude**

* Right off the bat, **wear boots with thick soles.** Any type of [combat boot](http://store.militaryspot.com/v/vspfiles/photos/RC5075-2T.jpg), [Red Wings](http://www.gravitypope.com/shoes/redwing/13969_0_2_700.jpg), [Wolverine 1000 miles](http://media2.hickorees.com/image/Wolverine1000MileRust_L1.jpg), [Doc martens](http://www.scorpioshoes.com/womens-3/boots-11/ankle-boots-58/martens-1460-unisex-classic-leather-ankle-1035-82_zoom.jpg), etc. A couple inches of sole thickness can make a world of difference. CDB's are okay, but [Timberlands](http://www.shoebuy.com/pi/theti/theti274767_26317_jb.jpg) are similar in price and give a bit more heel-height.

* This is super important: **Make sure you get your upper body/lower body porportions right.** If you long torsoed, wear hi rise pants (501's). If you're short torsoed, low rise (511's. 514's) works better. Again, everything is proportion.

* Related to the last point, **Go with cropped outerwear** like peacots, Levi's denim jackets or moto/double rider style leathers. If it looks too short for the model, then it's just right for you. Blazers in Small/Medium/Large sizes from a place like H&amp;M or Zara aren't going to look right; instead, go to a store that sells formalwear, get one in a a ""short"" size and get it slimmed. 

* **Wear tapered jeans/pants.** Always. You want to avoid like you're standing on two rectangles. 

* **Don't tuck your jeans into your sneakers/boots,** it'll cut off your leg and make you look shorter. Cuffing and stacking do this too, so if you want to cuff/stack your denim, do a single, small cuff rather than a chunky triple-cuff or something.

* **Make sure your shirts and pants fit slim**  ""Relaxed"" or ""slouchy"" items (espeically knitwear) aren't flattering to shorter guys.

* **Don't bother wearing button downs untucked unless they're tailored** (or from a brand like Band of Outsiders). Buy a nice belt and tuck them in instead. In general, this looks better if the top block of your jeans aren't super tight, so consider sizing up a size on the waist. 

* **Shorter guys should stick with vertical lines or no pattern when it comes to their clothes** - it will help you look taller. Checked patterns will disrupt the flow of an onlookers gaze to the left and right, which will make you seem wider, not a desired effect for short guys. (Via Madforpancakes)

Other considerations:

* Gain a bit of muscle, but not too much. The idea is that you don't want to look insubstantial but you don't want to look like a short meathead either. The nice thing about being short is that a little bit of muscle goes a *long* way on your smaller frame, so you'll reach your goals a LOT faster than someone who's 6'. 

* Have good posture. 

* Most importantly: don't worry about being short. Like weight, the numbers are often misleading, and how you present yourself goes a long way. Focus on the things you can change vs. worrying about things you can't.",,False,self,t5_2r65t,True,,,True,t3_qp4jb,http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/qp4jb/mini_guide_tips_for_short_guys/,

The store in question didn't have my size so they sent me to another store the next day that was closer to my house and said the manager would have them held for me.

So when I get there I try the pair on and just talk to the General manager about shoes for about a half an hour while I get ready to check out. the conversation slowly goes from casual to him telling me he was impressed with how much I knew about shoes and asked what my current schedule was like with work/school and all that, so he took my number and said he may call me if he needed someone to come in that wouldn't need much training for the holidays. 

well that being a couple weeks ago, I never really thought anything of it, but he called me about 20 minutes ago and said he would love for me to come in and work for him whenever I could get some spare time.

so to put it bluntly, reading this subreddit got me a job at Johnston and Murphy! 

I really wanted to thank everyone here and say that MFA has truly changed quite a bit for me and I'm glad to be a (rather insignificant probably) part of such a great community.

EDIT: wow, this got such an amazing response, thank you all again for what you do here, no matter how little you feel your input is taken, that's what makes this subreddit so amazing!

So, I went out and did just that, and after a few emails to each other, and a couple of trips to my local tailor, as well as some emails to the devs of the game, they began working on my own [""Wei Shen Windbreaker""](http://i.imgur.com/RHEmNct.jpg).

After waiting and waiting, I got an email this morning showing there progress; I'm quite impressed, and figured I would share it with you guys. The only thing they have left to do is the lining, and they are going to embroider their logo on the lining to have it say, ""Undercover, The Rules Are Different"", as a nod to the video game (one of the devs suggested I do that).

Tretorn is a Swedish company, [founded in 1891 as rubber company.](http://i.imgur.com/fsxcwGs.jpg)  The name ""Tretorn"" refers to the three exhaust towers at the original factory in Helsingborg, and the company got its start making galoshes, hoses and bike pedals.  When they started producing balls, they got them into the tennis industry, and in 1965, introduced a plimsoll called the Nylite.  In the early 1970s, Tretorn began sponsoring Swedish tennis legend Björn Borg, who wore Nylites when he played in the US (and Diadoras in Europe, thanks to a weird sponsorship contract).  Nylites were ingrained enough into tennis culture by the early 1980s that Lisa Birnbach included them in the [Official Preppy Handbook](http://www.amazon.com/Official-Preppy-Handbook-Lisa-Birnbach/dp/0894801406) as [""the tennis shoe of choice"".](http://i.imgur.com/e4nGpnt.png)

---

**Cleansers**

Cleansers are your basic face wash. Its job is to remove excess oil and dirt from your pores. Some people just use water if their skin is able to naturally achieve that perfect pH balance. The ones specifically for acne will contain 1-2% salicylic acid, but in most cases you will just want a gentle cleanser as salicylic acid has a tendency to dry out your skin. You should consult your dermatologist if you have moderate-to-severe acne as most products will not treat an underlying cause.

A lot of guys don't wash their face effectively. It's pretty simple. Wet your face with warm water to help loosen up dead skin then lather and scrub your face gently with the cleanser. Rinse with warm water to flush the crap out of your pores then rinse again with *cold water to minimize the appearance of your pores (important)*. 

Picking a cleanser is a personal preference since everyone's skin is different. I'm using this one right now: 

* [Philosophy Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser](http://www.amazon.com/Philosophy-Purity-Simple-One-Step-Cleanser/dp/B00021C1NG/)

**Toner**

Every time you wash your face you should be applying toner afterwards. Glycerol is the active ingredient in toner. It basically minimizes the appearance of pores and brings the natural moisture of your skin to the surface. Just wet a cotton square with it and rub it over your face. It's also a mild cleanser so you will notice all the shit that your cleanser missed after using this.

* [Neutrogena Pore Refining Toner](http://www.amazon.com/Neutrogena-Refining-Toner-Hydroxy-Formula/dp/B0000535RA/)

**Daytime Moisturizer**

This one is pretty important as it acts as a protective barrier against the outside world. Skin cancer runs in my family so sunscreen makes me feel better. I use one with a slight tint to even out my skin tone and cover up any red spots. It's like wearing make-up but without the social stigma.

* [Olay Definity Color Recapture](http://www.amazon.com/Olay-Definity-Color-Recapture-Light/dp/B0019Z8HT6/)

**Night-time Moisturizer**

Moisturizing at night is optional, but nice to have. Only really necessary if you have dry skin or if you want to improve the health of your skin over a long period of time. Dry skin means your face has to compensate and produce extra oils. This increases the chances of one getting clogged or infected which leads to acne.

* [Neutrogena Ageless Restoratives Anti-Oxidant Cream](http://www.amazon.com/Neutrogena-Ageless-Restoratives-Anti-Oxidant-Moisture/dp/B000R2YFZW/)

**Eye Roller**

Another nice to have. Your eyes are the most expressive part of your face. If you have puffy or dark circles under your eyes, a moisturizer + cold metal ball will help brighten them up. The effect is almost immediate. I use this a lot if I'm hungover, slept too long, or stay up too late.

* [Garnier Skin Renew Anti-Dark Circle Eye Roller](http://www.amazon.com/Garnier-Anti-Dark-Circle-Roller-0-50-Fluid/dp/B003RF82RI/)

**Deep Cleaning Pores**

If you want to get super OCD, there are a wide variety of products to remove shit from your pores.

* Tools like this [loop whitehead extractor](http://www.amazon.com/Suvorna-Whitehead-Remover-Comedone-Extractor/dp/B0019TM2E8/) will help you manually extract shit from your skin. Simply apply pressure and drag it over a pore and it will squeeze the junk out. This causes less redness than popping a zit with your fingers since there is less contamination.
* [Pore Strips](http://www.amazon.com/Biore-Pore-Perfect-Cleansing-Strips/dp/B0009EILKS) are also really effective. I use them maybe 1-2 times a month. I take pretty good care of my face and [a lot of shit](http://i.imgur.com/GXm7Z.jpg) still comes out of it.
* [Masks](http://www.amazon.com/Aztec-Secret-Indian-Healing-Clay/dp/B0014P8L9W/) essentially work the same as pore strips but for your entire face. You apply it, it hardens, then you peel/wash off everything it sticks to. I do it once a month at most. [It's fun](http://i.imgur.com/mnAs2.jpg).

**Closing Thoughts**

As most of you know, the community grew rapidly in 2012.  The number of subscribers almost tripled, we had over 9 million pageviews in December (our high-traffic month ever - up from 8.1 million in November) and [according to stattit, we're going to pass /r/geek later today as #42 in the list of subreddits by size.](http://stattit.com/r/malefashionadvice/)

We'd like to start 2013 with a small facelift for MFA, and that's where you come in.  

**Tomorrow morning I'm going to post a contest thread for two things - a new icon for the header, and a new public description of the sub.** 

**Note that this thread is just an announcement to (1) generate attention and interest beforehand, (2) answer questions about the contest, and (3) give folks some time to think and draw.  Please hold onto your proposals and ideas until tomorrow's thread.**

Details:

 * Header icons should be 120-200px wide and 40-75px tall, and no more than 100Kb.  Jpeg and png are both fine. Traditionally, header icons incorporate the Reddit alien logo somehow, and they should either say ""Reddit"" or nothing at all (since it's a redirect to the front page).  The icon shouldn't say MFA.  A little about why we're changing it - most big subs update their headers multiple times a year, but more importantly, it's time for our community to make a symbolic move away from worn-out, unfunny CDB inside jokes (which now outnumber actual CDB recommendations about 20:1).   

 * The current sub description is, ""Are you a guy who wants to dress better? We can do that.  Are you a lady who wants to help men dress better? We can do that.  Do you just want to look at pictures of well-dressed men? We can do that too.""  It doesn't really reflect the way the community works, and we can definitely do better.  500 characters, max.  Text only - no formatting, links or images.

 * Anyone can enter one or both categories.  The winners will be decided by a combination of community support (i.e., upvotes and supportive comments) and moderator discretion. The prize is Reddit Gold.

Thanks, and happy 2013!

This is an update and extension to a guide I put together last fall, and as always, suggestions, revisions and corrections are welcome!

Since their deep roots in American menswear is part of the reason I love Bean Boots, I wanted to start there (Section I below)  I also put together an overview of options and a buying guide (Section II).  

[But first, an inspiration album.](http://imgur.com/a/TE0lr)  

I realize these aren't everyone's cup of tea, but for me, the attraction is a direct function of their utility.  They aren't sleek, and when you wear them, they really stand out.  I don't know - maybe you have to have grown up in a place where everyone wore them.

----

**I.  History**

----

The origins of the Bean boot are essentially the origins of the company. [The Bangor Daily News gives one take on the history here](http://tinyurl.com/8kkohsx), and [here's another from Gizmodo](http://tinyurl.com/29yxofk).  And from Bean's own company history - 
&gt;In 1911, an avid outdoorsman named Leon Leonwood Bean returned from a hunting trip with cold, damp feet and a revolutionary idea. L.L. enlisted a local cobbler to stitch leather uppers to workmen's rubber boots, creating a comfortable, functional boot for exploring the Maine woods.
&gt;
&gt;L.L. began his business by working out of the basement of his brother's apparel shop. In 1912, he obtained a mailing list of nonresident Maine hunting license holders and prepared a three-page flyer that boldly proclaimed, ""You cannot expect success hunting deer or moose if your feet are not properly dressed. The Maine Hunting Shoe is designed by a hunter who has tramped the Maine woods for the last 18 years. We guarantee them to give perfect satisfaction in every way."" 

By the 1980s, the boots were iconic enough (with a certain demographic) that Lisa Birnbach made them a centerpiece of the tongue-in-cheek [*Official Preppy Handbook*](http://tinyurl.com/yemytoc) - see [here](http://i.imgur.com/ndPwQ.jpg) and [here](http://i.imgur.com/CzOVA.jpg), for example.

In 2009, when LL Bean [re-hired Alex Carleton](http://tinyurl.com/9l5r3wk
) (a former LL Bean designer who had left to found Rogue's Gallery) to design the new Signature line,  [he started with a Bean boot.](http://i.imgur.com/Zn5tz.jpg)

However, I think the more interesting history comes from many people's deep connection to the boots, which look almost identical to the ones their families have been buying for generations).  In 2010, Lawrence Schlossman (Sartorially Inclined, and How to Talk to Girls at Parties) started a series of guests posts called [The Bean Boot Project](http://tinyurl.com/y92e6ee).  He asked other menswear bloggers to write and post pictures of their experiences with the boots, and lots of them responded.  [This story](http://tinyurl.com/9bce6o9) (from a now-defunct blog called Wingtip) is my favorite -

&gt;My dad has been wearing Bean boots for at least as long as I've been alive.  The same pair.  Worn-in, broken-down, mud-encrusted.  The leather has wrinkled and aged.  The heel logo has long since worn off.  Even the laces have split dramatically.
&gt;
&gt;If I had to guess, I'd say I've given them more thought than he has.  To him, they are just boots.  He puts them on when it's wet.  He puts them on when it's cold, when it's muddy, or when it snows (conditions which, for anyone not familiar with Buffalo NY, reflect about 8 months of the year!)  But they are his boots.  The wear and tear reflect his labors.  They're the first and only shoes he puts on before he steps outdoors.
&gt;
&gt;Naturally, I've grown to admire the Bean boot.  It has been, after all, a consistent component of the man I look up to the most.  And while I may not be following my father's academic and professional footsteps, you can bet I'll be wearing the same shoes.

Bean boots have always been sewn in Maine by LL Bean employees - they aren't contracted out to third parties, and construction has never been outsourced to foreign countries.  A couple years ago, the guys from All Plaid Out and A Restless Transplant [visited the factory in Brunswick, ME ](http://tinyurl.com/ch7ttc) (the same factory that makes the LL Bean boat &amp; totes).  The post has a bunch of stories and [fantastic photos](http://tinyurl.com/8bhon9p), but here's their introduction - 

&gt;Walking into L.L. Bean’s factory in Brunswick, Maine feels exactly like it should. It smells of stale solvents; of tannery leathers oiled thick as an outfielder’s glove in mid-September; of raw canvas so heavy and fibrous that filaments cling to the insides of my nostrils. These smells, they fight for air as people flit back and forth in small work stations, moving through tasks with the grace and ease of highly skilled dancers. It looks like a factory should: a collection of task-specific machines designed by the very workers who use them every day, because, unlike the iconic Bean Boots produced here, you can’t find a triple-stitch machine in a catalogue. Each station has been retro-fitted to suit the assigned employee, right down to decorated oscillating fans and CD players blaring “Bleeding Love,” by Leona Lewis into cheap Chinese headphones; “It’s one way to make it through the day,” the stitcher yarns in an accent thick as a lobster roll. It sounds like a factory should sound: plenty of drumming and punching and carwonging, the zip of the skiving machine, the heavy-hammer thunk of the leather press….

LL Bean has also done some video walkthroughs/interviews of the construction process - [here's one from their own website](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZmL8xZyipY), and [here's one from a local TV network](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ov_63AACotc).

----

**II.  Buying Guide**

----

If you're going to order a pair, you have some options for (1) height, (2) lining, (3) material of the upper, (4) color, and (5) closure type (all broken out in more detail below).  But if you're buying your first pair, I recommend the [classic 8"" in tan](http://tinyurl.com/9o7bhtk).  

Note that, whichever options you're looking at, the boots are seriously oversized.  For the unlined boots, you'll want to buy a full 1-1.5 sizes below your regular shoe size.  For example, I wear 12.5 in dress shoes, 13 in running shoes, and an 11 in Bean boots, and they're roomy enough for thick wool socks.  [This blog post](http://thesilentist.com/post/2324964074/l-l-bean-boots-a-buyers-guide) suggests not sizing down quite as far for the lined boots.

For care, [I put together a step-by-step waterproofing guide last fall.](http://tinyurl.com/9xdl8zg)  Bean will also resole your boots with a full new rubber bottom half for about $30, which is how people are managing to pass these down through generations.  

While I'm a purist, but Bean isn't the only company making boots with leather uppers stitched to rubber soles.  Valet has a rundown of some other options [here](http://tinyurl.com/9mu5c7w).


*(1) Height*

They come in seven different heights, from slip-on [rubber mocs](http://tinyurl.com/8njdwk2) to massive [16"" tall Maine Hunting Shoes](http://tinyurl.com/975gwe2).  For most people, the [8"" boot](http://tinyurl.com/9gatu9e) is going to work best - it's tall enough to keep out snow and rain, but not so high that it's hard to walk in or tuck pants into.  Another versatile choice would be the [low gumshoes](http://tinyurl.com/9c5s9uo), which aren't quite slip-on but work well on damp, misty fall/spring days.  I wear my gumshoes for yardwork a lot, [so they've been out raking leaves quite a bit the last few weeks.](http://i.imgur.com/Bu21V.jpg)

*(2) Lining*

The standard Bean boots are unlined, but for serious winter wear, you'd want [a pair with Gore-Tex and Thinsulate](http://tinyurl.com/8zwzlxk).  They've also just started making them [with shearling lining](http://tinyurl.com/948j4w9), but I haven't read any reviews or tried on a pair personally.  For rain and all but the deepest, coldest snow,  the standard unlined boots with thick, wool socks are enough.  

*(3)  Upper Material*

In the main line of boots, there are some options for leather uppers, although they're generally limited to one height and color.  You can get the [10"" boots in bison leather](http://tinyurl.com/9t66q63), and the [10"" Maine Hunting Shoes](http://tinyurl.com/9evn62x) have pebble-grain leather (and come in lined and unlined versions).  Over in the Signature line, [there's a waxed canvas version](http://tinyurl.com/8emwftt) (as opposed to leather) available in four colors.  I think these look fantastic, but I'm not sure they'd be as waterproof as the originals.  Still, it's not like waxed canvas is porous or anything.

*(4) Color*

Hands down, if you want the most classic color, get tan.   Dark brown is the other main option, and it blends in better with the brown rubber soles, and makes it a little less obvious that you're wearing Bean boots (for good or ill).  They just added an even more ninja-esque [black leather/black rubber version for the mocs](http://tinyurl.com/8njdwk2).  The Signature line has been a little more inventive with colors, and [the waxed canvas version is available in navy, tan, olive and black](http://tinyurl.com/8emwftt).  [There's also a new black leather option](http://tinyurl.com/8l3btb2) Recently, Bean added two boots with red tread instead of the classic gum - in [bison](http://tinyurl.com/8utw3a5) and [tan leather](http://tinyurl.com/9rkfn2l) uppers.

*(5) Closure*

Laced boots are the standard, but they also make [pull-ons](http://tinyurl.com/8lt9x3f) and the brand-new [Lounger](http://tinyurl.com/9errbr2) with a strap.  [There was a blogger-led movement to bring back the Lounger out of retirement](http://tinyurl.com/8elwgxq), so I'm assuming that's why they feel like they can charge $200 for an unlined boot.

1328015451.0,310,self.malefashionadvice,p4hrk,I have foreseen the future of MFA...,623,313,213,http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/p4hrk/i_have_foreseen_the_future_of_mfa/,"I thought I would share what is going to happen to MFA - this has all happened before online and its going to happen again...

First thing that happens is that somene in the press stumbles into MFA on reddit and figures out this would make a really good story for the Fashion section of the New York Times or similar.  MFA is very impressed with themselves for this, everyone thinks this is ultra-cool.  Lots of new subscribers.

Not too long after, realizing the profit potential, one of the regular redditors here who also happens to want to be a writer, takes the basic content of entire sidebar, and major threads, and writes a book titled ""/r/malefashionadvice"".  Now reddit is pissed, this guy stole everything people worked on and is selling it for money.  But he changed the words just enough that he can't be stopped.  On the other hand, the book is pretty popular and MFA becomes more popular than ever.  The consistent contributors have reached semi-internet fame.

Media takes notice.  A TV network contacts Veroz, and he gets his own reality show taking hapless 20-somethings and teaching them how to dress.  Now he has broken out of semi-internet fame into being a legit D-list celebrity.  He does the talk show circuit.  

You show up to work/school one day and it turns out 1/2 your class is wearing CDBs.  A girl in the class makes fun of all of you for being MFA drones.  A chinese company starts selling exact clones of AE walnut strands look (of course not quality but nobody can tell!) for $45.  Kohls adds a MFA section in their store with cheap things they claim to be MFA-approved, by the author who claims to be able to bless such things like that for a nominal fee.

From hitting mega popularity, everything MFA recommends is now falling exactly out of style.  The newbs are now wearing the new clothes, but everyone who was reading it in 2011 has thrown away their MFA uniform, migrated to a totally new forum, and started formulating a new generation of style that is just enough tweaked from the masses to avoid being the butt of jokes.

And I'm really pissed because I just spent $350 on Allen-Edmonds Walnut Strands before I realized this is what is about to transpire.",,False,self,t5_2r65t,False,,,True,t3_p4hrk,http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/p4hrk/i_have_foreseen_the_future_of_mfa/,

**My Objectives For This Guide.**
 
I don't want to get involved in the uniform-debate shitstorm that seems to be raging right now. I am posting this guide because I am currently interested in a certain grungy, industrial, military-flavored, workwear/biker style. Hopefully there are other readers with similar interests, or at least readers I can convince that such a style is pretty damn cool; hopefully I can give some good pointers to achieving that style. I have the humble aspiration that this guide will effectively contribute to the diversity of style within MFA.
 
**The look We Want**

Dirty, grungy, beat up, rugged, scarred, and still kickin’. This look says “I'll probably sleep in my boots tonight and I'll definitely die in them.” It’s the look of someone who’s had to walk long miles through some unfriendly territory and has some miles left to go. The clothes are worn in and wrinkled, the colors are faded, the boots are scuffed and scratched. There’s a bag on the shoulder with everything you need to live another few days.

Dramatic? Sure. It’s a dramatic look, full of implied (or overt) strength.

Here are a few pictures of fellow MFAers who I’ve seen looking great in this style. [Cinic](http://i.imgur.com/Edvch.jpg), [Eccentrica](http://cdn.dressed.so/i/4f7dcfcab343am.jpg), [Uniqlooo](http://cdn.dressed.so/i/4f7762a2d814dm.jpg), [LeTigreTigre](http://cdn.dressed.so/i/4f58cd6d55a6fm.jpg), [Trashpile](http://cdn.dressed.so/i/4f4ce2623c367m.jpg). Personally, I think all these outfits would look better the longer they're worn, the dirtier and grungier they get.

**How to Get There**
 
We're looking to achieve a certain aesthetic here, so I can describe that for you and point you in the right direction with some basics and essentials, but bear in mind that experimentation on your part is essential to owning the look. I provide a template - you provide the style. Let's build an outfit!

**THIS PART IS IMPORTANT:** I want to de-emphasize the importance of pricing and branding in achieving this style. It’s supposed to be affordable. I’m asking you to really live in these clothes. They will look better if you beat them up. The only places you will find a correlation with quality and price is leather goods. Always buy good leather; good leather costs money. In my opinion, however, the difference between a Barbour m65 and my Urban Outfitters cotton m65 is irrelevant. Here, all that matters is that you like the cut and the look. If you want Barbour, buy Barbour. If you want UO, buy UO. “Buy the thing you want, not the thing that’s like the thing you want” - Trashpile.
  
* *Boots* are the obvious choice for our military-flavored biker look. The oft-recommended [Katahdin Iron Works Engineer Boots](http://www.llbean.com/llb/shop/49464?page=mens-katahdin-iron-works-engineer-boots) are a solid choice. The brown color will pair well with most of the pants in the next section. Also worth considering would be a pair of black combat boots like [Doc Martens 1490s](http://www.zappos.com/dr-martens-1490-black-smooth). Beat em up, scuff em up, they'll only look better and better. Classic sneakers are also fine for a less militaristic look, Converse, Keds, or Vans all valid choices.
 
* *Pants* are a pretty versatile category here. Buy a pair of raw denim jeans, slim straight if you are slim, tapered for bigger dudes. I'm wearing Levis Rigid 510s right now because the price was right and the quality is satisfactory, but the other denim brands preached here are great too (Nudie, APC, 3Sixteen, Unbranded, etc). Beyond jeans, I like slim-fit cargos for this look. [Dockers Alpha](http://www.dockers.ca/canada/en/feat/alpha-khaki.asp) makes an affordable slim-fit cargo, as does [Land's End Canvas](http://canvas.landsend.com/pp/mens-slim-fit-cargo-pants~226870_-1.html?cm_mmc=Froogle-_-null-_-Canvas-_-data_feed) as do most big forward fashion stores like [H&amp;M](http://www.hm.com/us/product/94239?article=94239-C#article=94239-B) and [Uniqlo](http://www.uniqlo.com/us/CPaGoods/itemcode=070768). [RRL](http://www.ebay.com/fashion/mens-clothing/Pants/RRL/57989#%7B%221325%22%3A%7B%22_pgn%22%3A%221%22%2C%22_sop%22%3A%2212%22%2C%22_ipg%22%3A%2248%22%2C%22selId%22%3A%2257989%22%2C%22selAspects%22%3A%22Style%3DCargo%22%2C%22aspects%22%3A%22BOTTOMSIZE~SelectedTab%3DRegular%5EINSEAM~%5EBRAND~Shortlist%3DRRL%5ECOLOR~%5EMATERIAL~%5EPRICE~%5ECONDITION~%5EFORMAT~%5ESELLER~%5ELOCATION~%22%2C%22svcfrom%22%3A%22SILSEL%22%7D%7D) has some very viable options via ebay or local stockists. You have options for color in the pants you choose, but keep them generally muted: Khaki, brown, olive, indigo, black, etc.
 
* *Jackets* are another place for diversity. To play up the military side of this look grab a classic [M65 Field Jacket](http://www.zib-militaria.de/WebRoot/Store8/Shops/61431412/4AAC/BEE8/9EF4/DDF2/CABD/C0A8/2936/E99C/M65RegimentOliv.jpg) or one of its [many modern derivations](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l8eeqkmz2g1qbuw3b.jpg), or, for colder weather, throw on a [military parka](http://acontinuouslean.files.wordpress.com/2009/03/relwen_aw09_5.jpg). The other major category to look into is *Leather*. Leather jackets are awesome. The classic [Schott Perfecto](http://www.filmjackets.com/VENDORS/SchottNYC/SchottPerfectoFT-lrg.jpg) is a great choice, as would be a [Cafe Racer Moto Jacket](http://clothesbeforehoes.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/restoration-hardware-schott-nyc-vintaged-cafe-racer-motorcycle-jacket-01.jpeg). [Temple of Jawnz](http://templeofjawnz.com/) is another widely recommended maker of leather products. Finally, don't overlook the humble Denim Jacket, humbly modeled [here](http://i.imgur.com/qN3am.jpg) and [here](http://i.imgur.com/AXKX5.jpg) by yours truly.
 
* *Shirts* are tricky. In my opinion, either a crew or v-neck t-shirt is perfectly acceptable. White is classic, clean, and simple, but other dark or muted colors will work as well. Different tees will contribute to different looks. A white crew neck tee will send a very strong 1950s James Dean or Steve McQueen americana vibe, while a long drapy scoop neck tee will push the look forward into darker goth-ninja territory.

Beyond t-shirts, flannels and henleys would be strong choices, as would denim or chambray shirts. For warmer weather, I could imagine some tank tops or scoop necks working as well. The shirt is usually under a jacket, so the key is to allow it to mesh with and accent the outfit as a whole.
 
* *Accessories* and by accessories I mostly mean bags. This is a look that benefits a lot from a bag over the shoulder or hanging from both, as the case may be. You have a lot of different choices here as well. The easiest and, to my mind, most effective route is to pick up a military surplus [backpack](http://www.armynavysales.com/products/jumbo-modular-field-pack/), [Nato Pack](http://www.armynavysales.com/products/medium-nato-style-rucksack/) or [messenger bag](http://www.armynavysales.com/products/medium-nato-style-rucksack/). [This Alice Pack](http://i.imgur.com/oMQLY.jpg), in process of customization with patches from nations I’ve traveled, is my current go-to bag. It’s rugged as shit and pretty comfortable too. That said, anything with that certain beat-up, grungy, rugged, look will suffice here. That bag gives you room to tweak the look and is the primary accessory here. As far as other accessories go, you may be able to incorporate a [scarf](http://styleinsp.tumblr.com/post/18256023557) or a [hat](http://www.cheguevara.be/wp-content/uploads/che+guevara7gr.jpg) but it’s easy to go wrong here. Be cautious. This advice also applies to jewelry. This is a look can can support more jewelry than you often see in MFA. Accent with leather bands/straps/cords, chains, or wooden beads.
