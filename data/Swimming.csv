1357718394.0,177,self.Swimming,168m6r,The Most Common Freestyle/Front Crawl Errors I see at all levels and what can be done to correct them.,193,16,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/Swimming/comments/168m6r/the_most_common_freestylefront_crawl_errors_i_see/,"I'll preface this as saying, for those of you who do not know, I've been a competitive swimmer for 10+ years, culminating in a 4 year NCAA D3 career. I also taught Red Cross swim lessons for 7 years. Take my opinion for what you will.

I will, from this point forward, refer to the ""front crawl"" as freestyle. Sorry TheGreatCthulhu, this is just a habit that will never die.

The freestyle is generally broken down into phases: Entry, Catch, Pull/Power, and the Recovery. The entry is when the hands are entering the water out front, extending and reaching. Then the Catch happens when the forearm and hand drop and anchor on to the water. The Pull/Power phase is when the lats really engage and accelerate the body. The Recovery is when the hands have reached the hips and are done pulling and are raised out of the water to begin the cycle over.

**1) Rotation:**

Early on in the instruction of children and new swimmers, much attention is drawn, in my opinion incorrectly, to the shoulder rotation of the freestyle. In fact, more attention should be focused on the hips and full body rotation. Swimming is a full body activity, and every stroke requires rhythmic motions of the entire body. Novice swimmers often focus on just rotating the shoulders, while leaving the hips relatively stationary. This is incorrect and inefficient. The proper freestyle technique is that in which the entire body rolls side-to-side, the rotation of which is being lead and driven by the hips, abdominals and lower back. Think of your entire body being on a roasting spit like a pig. You will then rotate about this long axis as you make your way down the pool.

Here is a video of Ian Thorpe (greatest 200/400/800m swimmer ever) swimming: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv_sDYHYzFw

Notice how his hips and shoulders rotate together. His whole body smoothly transfers momentum from side-to-side as he swims forward. The ideal freestyle would evenly rotate to each side, but this is never usually the case. Every swimmer has a preferred breathing side, and you will tend to rotate more towards that side, especially when trying to breathe. Even the world's best swimmers have a dominant side. That is OK. 

Notice also how Thorpe is looking forward and down while he swims. He's looking at about a 30-45 degree angle forward, if looking at the black line is 0 and straight at the wall in 90. 

**2) Dropping the Elbow in the Catch**

In freestyle as well as the other three competitive strokes, the entire forearm and hand must be used as a single unit to provide the most propulsion. Compare the surface area of just your hand, to the surface area of your hand + your forearm. Which do you think allows you to grab the most water and apply the most force? 

The key to using the entire forearm and hand as a paddle is to minimize wrist flexion and maintain a ""high elbow"" pull. A proper high elbow pull looks like this:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6qIhkuzTx0

Here, Grant Hackett, the greatest 1500m swimmer to ever live, demonstrates an EXCELLENT high elbow pull. Once his arm goes out front of his body, his elbow stays at the surface of the water while he lowers his forearm and hand into the water and anchors it in place. He then pulls his body past that anchored forearm and accelerates down the pool. Notice how this pull also ties in nicely with the rotation of the hips. When his arm is in the water anchored and pulling, that same side hip is rotating up as the arm pulls back. The pulling motion and hip rotation are inherently entangled. Hackett is always pulling with his forearm and hand leading the motion, he never drops his elbow or leads the pull with his elbow first. 

Maintaining a high elbow pull recruits more of the lats and upper back, and places less stress on the rotator cuff and deltoids. Many people who complain about chronic shoulder and biceps tendon problems would be well served by trying to keep their elbows high and using the larger muscles in the back. 

This video, teaching ""meat hook"" freestyle is an excellent in-depth look at a high elbow free:
http://www.floswimming.org/coverage/234221-Technique-Tuesday/video/174628-Meat-Hook-Freestyle

In the video he also mentions sculling out and kind of waivering back and forth with the arm out front. This is just coasting and wasted effort that is delaying the pull. This is also a good time to bring up the good old ""S"" curve patterned freestyle. Years ago, it was believed the best way to pull in freestyle was to draw an S (or mirrored S) with the hand in the water. This is really not correct. The proper pull pulls down through the hips straight back. The body rotates with respect to the moving forearm/hand, which, if viewed from the frame of reference of stationary, non-rotating hips, it would look like an S pull. BUT YOUR HIPS ROTATE, so just pull straight back, keeping that elbow above the hand and wrist. 

**3) Breathing:**

The freestyle breath is often over looked. Lots of people think that you just turn your head, suck in air, and go. The fastest and most efficient freestyle breath is one that is well timed within the stroke. The proper freestyle breath also doesn't require too much leaning/laying on the non-breathing arm during the breath. If you're going to concentrate really hard about a high elbow pull and training this as a habit, make sure you aren't really laying on the elbow and pressing outward when you breath. Most often people really LAY on opposite arm when the breath, sort of pressing down and out with their arm as one fixed lever. This places lots of extra stress on shoulder and elbow. A high elbow pull is possible when breathing and not, it will just take some practice. 

Listen/watch this video about the breath: http://www.floswimming.org/coverage/234221-technique-tuesday/video/99220-the-freestyle-breath

Many people also like to LIFT their head out of the water to breath, when in fact you only need to rotate your head to the side, with one goggle still in the water and one out, to get all the air you need. The head can stay in line with the body, at that 30-45 degree angle forward, but just rotated to the side. The wake created by the head creates a pocket of low water behind it, allowing you to breath. 

Erik Vendt, one of the USA's greatest distance, 400IM, and generally tough event swimmers has a pretty good breath technique here: http://www2.pictures.gi.zimbio.com/Swimming+Olympic+Team+Trials+Day+8+0Eim5do-EGvl.jpg

**4) Hands**

I brought this up a little before, but I am going to touch (hah!) on a few more points about what to do with your hands during freestyle. Firstly, many people think you should squeeze your hands tight to make super taught paddles or almost cup your hands. Don't do this, this isn't necessary and will almost certainly lead to hand cramps. Instead let you hands relax. Don't spread your fingers out but don't smash them together either. 

When your hands are entering the water out front of you, they should be about shoulder width apart. Don't think about pin-point precision with the hand entry. Too often I see people really tense up their arms and hands trying to exactly place their hands in the right spot right out in front of them. Relax. Just extend your arm forward and let it drop. Re visit that first video I showed you. Watch Thorpe's arms out front. He just sort of lets them drop/glide into the water in front of him. The phase of freestyle where your arms are out of the water is call the recovery, let it be that. 

The other common thing is what was mentioned in the meat hook video. The tendency to have the hands kind of wander and wiggle around out front after they entry but before the catch. This only delays the catch and leads to gliding and coasting instead of constant propulsion down the pool. 


**5) Recovery Phase**

The recovery phase is the part of the stroke most people see from the deck and what many people base their opinions about ""smooth"" swimming on. 

The recovery phase should begin once the hand has reached the hip/waist area of the (maybe 3-4 inches below the hip bones). Once the hand has reached that level, it's travelled 98% of the distance it can in the pull. The recovery then starts with the ELBOW. The elbow is picked up out of the water with a relaxed hand/forearm and brought forward to begin the next cycle. Note there IS NO FLICKING OF THE WRIST OR HAND out the back of the stroke.

Watch this video of Phelps: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ax77_hHq9Dc&amp;t=1m15s

His elbows start the recovery and begin to come out of the water once his hands reach his suit/waist area. He isn't locking out his elbow to finish the pull and he isn't flicking his hands and wrist. He then extends and drops his wrists forward to start the entry and catch of the next cycle. Watch the video from the start to see him really put many of these points together well. 

One of the very common sightings recently has been the straight arm or windmill freestyle recovery. Unless you're an advanced competitive swimmer, I would stay away from this. Done improperly it can lead to shoulder injury and additional stress. 

**Conclusion**

I really hope this has all been informative and helpful. While it seems great to try and make all of these changes and tweaks all at once I strongly advise against it. Making stroke changes takes lots of time, and you can really only focus on one minor change at a time. Don't dive in to your next workout or practice and make wholesale changes. You'll end up spending too much time thinking and not enough time swimming. Pick one thing per practice to work on and do it well. 

Also, don't just think that drills and easy practices are the times you can work on your technique. Work on your technique ALL THE TIME. If you can't manage to do something right in the middle of a mainset, what makes you think you'll be able to do it right on race day? Every set is a great opportunity to work on something!",,False,self,t5_2r0po,False,,,True,t3_168m6r,http://www.reddit.com/r/Swimming/comments/168m6r/the_most_common_freestylefront_crawl_errors_i_see/,

1366222666.0,94,self.Swimming,1cjqtw,Cancer can't stop me from swimming,104,10,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/Swimming/comments/1cjqtw/cancer_cant_stop_me_from_swimming/,"I am not even going to pretend this is a short thing:

I was diagnosed with cancer back in 2009.  I was 1 month from getting married and it just pretty much devastated me.  Anyway, I had lymphoma.  But one of the my nodes had swelled at the top of my lungs to about 8 CM.  Now that sounds small (in cancer terms it is huge), but a tumor pushing on your esophagus is a big deal no matter what.  If I had gone out and passed out from drinking it could have killed me. 

After 6 months of chemo, one surgery and 4 months of radiation, I was left with severe scar tissue in that area.  The doctor told me to take it easy exercising because of the old tumor. So I did.  Now here is where the story really begins.  When I went on chemo I was 220 pounds.  Unlike most patients, I actually gained weight on chemo.  Went up to 244.  I kept eating because it made me feel better.  Coupled with the fact that now I had a thyroid shot because of radiation (I had a lymph node in my neck that needed to be radiated and it also hit the thyroid)  I was up to 256 by December 2012.  I went on a vacation and sitting down I popped a button of my size 42 pants.  That was the final straw.  I decided to do something about it.

Back when I was in the Navy, I used to swim laps around people.  I was 160 pounds.  Nothing but swimming muscles (from growing up in Florida) but now I was nothing by flab.  But I was going to get in the pool and I was going to swim.  I was going on a diet too.  In the Navy I could swim 500 yards in 7:30.  I don’t know what that translate out to 1 mile (doing quick math in my head probably about 26:15) but I sat down and made my goal to get my weight down to 180 and to get a mile in the pool down to 35 minutes.  This was January 2nd.  The first thing I did was give up soda and fast food.  Right away that made a difference in my weight.  I dropped almost 10 pounds that first month.  By Valentine’s day I was already under 240.  But my pool swimming was going terrible.  At least in my eyes.  I got in the first time and swam as much as I could in an hour.  I got 12 laps.  35 (yes 35.25 technically) laps would be a mile.  It took me one hour and I couldn’t even get half a mile. 

I made a goal then to at least get a mile, no matter how long it took.  The next day I came out and swam and stopped and swam and stopped until I got my mile around 1 hour and 20 minutes.  From there I set a plan, I would do a lap free style and a lap breast (because that was helping me with catching my breath, my lungs ached from the scar tissue and I was having trouble doing any type of stroke) with the understanding that I would work my way towards all freestyle.  So after about a month, I moved to 7 laps free, 7 laps breast and alternated each 7 laps (why 7?  Because 70 lengths is 35 laps and I can count to 5 and 7 while swimming than I can to 70 and breaking up the stroke helped me keep count).  After I got around 50 minutes, I started to introduce free style into my breast stroke sections, I would do 7 free, 1 breast, 1 free, 1 breast…until I did 7 and then do 7 free and so on.  That helped me get it around 44 minutes.  Which I stayed out forever.  Until 2 weeks ago when I dropped down to 41.  THEN today I did my first sub-40 minute mile.  Now I still have lots of work to do, but I have dropped my weight down to 222 and my swimming time down to 40.  5 more minutes is my goal.  And then after that who knows.  But I also had my check-up last week for my post-cancer career and the scar tissue is starting to decrease too.  The Dr, had never seen scar tissue decrease.  He doesn’t understand it, but he is happy for me because I am working hard.  He took me off my thyroid medicine because whatever levels he looks at look good now.  I am just happy because for the first time I feel like I have fully recovered from the cancer.  No more losing breath and feeling sorry for myself.  I can do anything.

TL:DR- I had cancer that stopped me from being able to fully swim, but I just dropped below 40 minute mile for the first time since.

1330967539.0,60,self.Swimming,qirf3,The swimming personality,63,3,47,http://www.reddit.com/r/Swimming/comments/qirf3/the_swimming_personality/,"[This article](http://www.bodyrecomposition.com/training/why-the-us-sucks-at-olympic-lifting-part-18.html) gave me a chuckle today. I think it makes sense why I felt akin to my swim teammates as well. Do you guys find this true for yourselves?

&gt; Swimming, and therefore swimmers, take this to the extreme.  Because swimming is a dreadfully solitary sport where swimmers spend up to 24 hours per week swimming in silence staring at a black line in a pool.  They live their training lives in silence (ears are underwater) staring at the bottom of the pool.  It’s only recently that underwater MP3 players became available to help pass the time.  You have to be pretty driven to do this.  And while other countries had the whole Communist/Socialist ‘do it or else’ plus incentives program, American swimmers don’t.  Why would anybody put themselves through this shit?    

&gt; And the explanation for this is suggested by another oddity about swimmers: they often have the highest GPA of all the collegiate athletes at the school, often having a 4.0 GPA in addition to being elite athletes.  Effectively, guys who pursue swimming are mildly psychotic internally driven perfectionists who prefer individual activities.   And swimming fits that bill in spades.    

&gt; Swimming is a technically demanding sport and swimmers spend years perfecting their strokes. The training is dreadful and boring; you swim 2-4 hours per day 6 days per week and most of it is staring at a black line in the water and doing it in silence.   For no incentives.   And about the only reason anybody would be insane enough to do that or to drive themselves to the top is this:  they want to.   They have that massively internally motivated personality style that does it simply for the sake of doing it.",,False,self,t5_2r0po,False,,,True,t3_qirf3,http://www.reddit.com/r/Swimming/comments/qirf3/the_swimming_personality/,

At the time (8th or 9th grade), we were both on our schools swim team so our suits colors matched.  At some point a long time ago, she bought a two piece that matched her one piece because she liked the colors and design.

So, when our mom was doing laundry, the swap was made.  Maybe she was trolling and curious what would happen or it was an honest mistake.  I have no idea.

Anyway, after the swap, I packed my bag and went to school.  That afternoon, in the locker room, I discovered the error.  Had this not been a big meet with a rival, I would have worn a practice suit but regulations required matching suits.  So I was stuck with the only suit I had.  

Damn, it was such an odd feeling putting on my sisters 2 piece bottom, more so when I did it in front of the team and oh my god when I walked out of the locker room up on deck.

No one noticed.  I performed better than ever and led the team to a victory.  So for luck, I kept doing it and never told my sis.  I also found ti to be a little more comfortable.  It never came up and we never spoke of it.

A few months later, we were at a water park eating lunch and my sister asked why I was wearing her suit.  (im a swimmer and only own speedos as I hate board shorts)  Mom and dad had already gone to the lazy river so it was just the two of us sitting there.  

I about died.  I denied it.  I turned red and covered with my towel.

She pointed to her hip and grinned.

As it turns out, she found my speedo more comfortable than her bottoms and I confided in her that I found the opposite true as well.

For the next 3 years, my sis and I did this until we both graduated high school.

Most of it is in regards to front crawl.


When kicking:
 
* Keep toes pointed like a ballerina.

* Try not to bend your knees and keep your entire leg relatively straight.

* Keep your butt above water.

* Try to practice with a kick board if available.

* Try and have JUST your ankles and the heel/sole of your foot come out of the water, if your whole leg is coming out of the water, you are going to move backwards and will have a bad time. 

Arms: 

* Extend your arms, reach out as if you are picking an apple for every stroke/ or climbing a mountain.

* Keep your fingers closed, remember you eat cereal with a spoon not a fork. You need to carry that water with you. 

* Elbows should be nice and high, this will eventually help with your breathing, and even help you w/ extending your arms.  

Breathing: 

* Every breath you take try and have either your right ear and cheek in the water, or your left ear and cheek in the water. Do not raise your head out of the water.

* Try and count how many strokes you will do before your next breath. I recommend doing every 3 or 5 arm strokes (mostly 3) this is so you can work on Bi-lateral breathing, or breathing from both sides. 

* Breathing on one side is considered a bad habit and can put you at a disadvantage, especially in open water swims. So just count ONE PULL-TWO PULL- BREATH RIGHT- ONE PULL-TWO PULL-BREATH LEFT.


Misc.: 
* Try to swim with a friend.

* Only swim if a life guard is present.

* Try and have a set plan before you go swim.

* Its okay to have people critique you while you are swimming.

* Everytime you go to the pool, don't think so much about how much you need to swim, rather the quality. Your priority is to improve your stroke.

* Try and sign up for lessons with a swim teacher. Many cities have free lessons. Personally, I work with the NYC Parks and Recreations and all lessons are free ages  2 and up (Yes, even for adults).

* Always have a checklist in your head while swimming, make sure you know what you want to work on, if you are in the right lane, if your arm is extended, etc. 

* Try not to be lazy or build on bad habits. 

* Drinking water, stretching, and getting a good amount of sleep are all ways to prevent your body from cramping.

* Be cool in the pool. 

* Oh don't pee in the pool, or it will turn blue around you.

I have always enjoyed the water but never swam in school as I was not good enough. The most competitive swimming I have ever done was when I was 15 in boarding school, I swam 50m butterfy (came 4th but was disqualified) and breaststroke in the 4x50m medley relay. 

I learned how to swim when I was 6 in aftercare when I followed the older boys into jumping into the deep end and started drowning before the aftercare teacher jumped in and yanked me out. I then spend most of my free time after school at the Yeoville swimming pool teaching myself how to swim.

Last year, about this time, I decided to start swimming as my belly was starting to get over flabby and I needed to get into some exercise. I think I swam twice. In September I was on a private island in Halong Bay, Vietnam having a beer with a British guy looking out into the sea and decided to go swim to touch a protruding limestone rock mass. It was a 1,5 kilometer swim there-and-back and I enjoyed it, open-water long distance swimming has always been meditative for me: Focus on strokes, breathing and my mind just goes empty (I had casually swam in university and did about 1,5 km every session).

When I returned home in October I wanted to swim, I found this sub-reddit and set about doing 0 to 1650 (in meters) bt due to my job taking me out of my city and country (I had to do a few trips to the DR Congo and Mozambique at the end of last year) I didn't get past the day 1 of week 2.

This year, 6 weeks ago I started the 0 to 1650m and today at lunch I finished the straight 66 laps. I am happy with myself and thankful for this sub-reddit for it. I plan to do some sprinting now to get better technique and intensive workout; and possibly some gym work. I missed [Midmar](http://www.midmarmile.co.za/) two weeks ago but next year I am going to smash it as a white-hat. I've wanted to do it for 10 years and now have the confidence for it.

Welcome to all.",56,10,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/Swimming/comments/xk579/thanks_to_the_olympics_we_have_a_lot_of_new/,"* **How can I get an Olympic swimmer's body?**

Answer 1: Become an Olympic swimmer. 

To do this get a time machine and go back to ages 8 to 10. Start swimming and join a club, swim every week, later ever day, later twice a day, later 4 to 6 hours a day. Add some weights. Watch your diet, cut out junk food, get a nutritionist and a coach. There's not much to it.

Answer 2: Go swimming. Enjoy it for itself, discover it's tough and most of us spend years and years trying to get better, and only partially succeeding. Focus on improving your stroke, fitness and health. Make friends you can trust. These aspects will last you a lifetime, your momentary obsession with looks will pass.

* **I want to get back to/start swimming. What do I do?**

Answer: See the sidebar. Use the Zero to 1500 plan. Swimming is *hard*. Don't get discouraged but keep at it. Don't let the Speedoes fool you, us swimmers are fitter than almost any other athlete you know, even us older ones.  Make sure you do some drills and concentrate on technique always. Mid your shoulders and do some backstroke everyday.

Also in the sidebar? Drills! Do them. And join a club, you can only improve so far when swimming by yourself.

* **Am I too old?**

Answer 1: To swim, never. You may be too old to hope to be an Olympic swimmer, but you always join a club, especially Master's. Swimming brings health, fitness, and not least camaraderie with like minded individuals. Or swim open water, when people stay competitive until their 70s.

Answer 2: To become an Olympic or National level swimmer, maybe. Very few successful swimmers start after about 12 years of age. (Breeja Larson comes to mind, and ...). Maybe you can prove an exception though, you won't know until you try. Get out there and swim.

* **How do I get faster?**

Answer: Listen to your coach. They are the ones who see you regularly. If you don't have a coach, join a club. Keep swimming and then swim more. Work on your technique, always.",,False,self,t5_2r0po,False,,,True,t3_xk579,http://www.reddit.com/r/Swimming/comments/xk579/thanks_to_the_olympics_we_have_a_lot_of_new/,moderator

1366759342.0,50,self.Swimming,1cyys3,You don't have to swim for a college to swim in college,54,4,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/Swimming/comments/1cyys3/you_dont_have_to_swim_for_a_college_to_swim_in/,"This year I started college as a chemical engineering major. I really wanted to swim in college, but the only schools with good engineering programs with D2 swim teams (I wanted to go D2. Would have been a perfect fit) that were near by were extremely expensive. The cost of school plus the stress of my major (damn it's hard) convinced me it wasn't a good idea. I decided to go to my states D1 school that had a great engineering program but no men's swim team. I didn't want to stop swimming, but I was tired of competition. I wanted to enjoy swimming. My ex girlfriend's sister happened to be the vice president of the swim club of the school I was going to, so that gave me a connection to the swim club. She made it sound like a lot of fun so I was really excited to join. It sounded like the college swimming experience without the hard work. So I joined the swim club which practiced 3 times a week for an hour and a half. Not too much commitment, but still the perfect amount of swimming. I thought. I told myself that I just needed a little bit of swimming once in awhile, go to a meet once a month and make some friends and I would love swimming. And I did all of those things. I was swimming for fun, not to get better. I never thought I would improve ever again, which I was fine with. But for some reason, I started doing more. I joined the Water Polo club (a blast) and started practicing with them 3 times a week to swim more. Then I went to my local USA swim club and started volunteering as a coach once a week. Then I started swimming once a week with them as well. This snowball effect kept going. Since then I stopped playing water polo for reasons such as pained knees and extra homework, but this semester I ended up training with my USA club 3 times a week and my college club the 3 other days a week. I started doing dryland every morning and I'm now a hired substitute coach for the local USA swim club. I was a member of this team in high school, but it was a branch of the team in a different town. I swam in USA meets and started improving in events I didn't do in high school (backstroke and distance events). I had a good thing going. Then I realized that I didn't have to settle for never improving in my events again. I wanted to be the best I could be. I wanted to beat myself. I trained hard, with people who wanted to train hard as well. My new coach was amazing. He had great credentials. After training for a couple months, the LSC championship for that area came up. I swam in it during high school and I was really excited for it. I had always tapered for the high school state meet which was 2 weeks before, so I usually didn't see a bunch of best times at the championship meet (D1s) so I was excited to taper for this meet. When it came along, I was shocked. I swam 7 individual events: 50 FR 100 FR 200 FR 100 BR 200 BR 100 FL 200 IM. In highschool I trained for the 200 IM. I considered it my best race. At D1s this year, I cut time in every event except the 200 IM and 100 fly. I was amazed. I never thought I would be faster than what I was my senior year. I even cut time in my 100 breast, arguably my second best event. It was a great meet. Better yet, the next weekend I traveled with the USA team to sectionals in Oklahoma. I had never been to sectionals before. It was such an amazing experience and it filled with me for motivation for next year. Since I tapered for D1s and sectionals, I thought that I wouldn't go faster than those times this year. I had 6 weeks until college club nationals in Atlanta Georgia (ECC nationals). I took 2 weeks off to relax and started swimming again. Because of this break, I figured I would only have a decent meet. I tapered again, but didn't expect much. But when I got to nationals, my mind changed. I wanted to succeed. I wanted to prove people wrong, beat myself, improve. My very first event was the 200 Breast and it was the one I was ranked highest in, 23rd. At D1s I went a 2:25.86 which was very good for me. The year before I was only a 2:28. I was hoping to go a 2:25 low or even a 24. After the first 100 of the race, me and the guy in the other center lane had a pretty good lead. at the 150, he was probably an arms length ahead of me. I told myself I wouldn't let him beat me. I surged ahead and ended up beating him by almost a second. I was happy with that but I was ecstatic when I looked at the timing board. I went a 2:19.87 not only did I cut 6 seconds, but  I got my very first sectionals cut, which had been my goal for 3 years. All my years of swimming had been worth it for that one race and that great time of mine. I ended up getting 12th in that event. The rest of the meet went great with pr's in the 100 free 100 breast and 100 IM as well as a season best in my 200 IM. After such great meets this season, I decided to make it my number 1 goal to pr in my 200 IM, my event. At nationals, I went a 2:10.75 and my best is a 2:08.91 next year I hope to go a 2:06. I know this is pretty long, but I just wanted to share my story and tell you that just because you don't swim for a college, doesn't mean you cant swim in college, doesn't mean you can't train, improve, have fun, and be the best you can be. Not swimming in college was probably one of the best decisions I have made. Because of it, I love swimming more than I ever have and I made great friends along the way. I realize now that just being in the water, having easy practices, making friends, or just competing for entertainment isn't what makes swimming fun. It's training, and working as hard as you can to beat yourself that makes swimming fun. Watching yourself improve and dropping time makes swimming the sport it is too me. Even if I could, I wouldn't choose any other sport over this one.

1365625519.0,47,self.Swimming,1c34hg,Is decent pool etiquette really that hard?,57,10,75,http://www.reddit.com/r/Swimming/comments/1c34hg/is_decent_pool_etiquette_really_that_hard/,"So, long story short, I've recently moved to the US from Australia and needed a pool to swim at. I found a gym with a little three lane 25 yard pool and all was grand. However, I've since discovered at this pool people like to swim two to a lane, one on each side and that's that. People will sit on the side and wait for someone to get out rather than circle swim.

So far it hasn't been an issue because there's usually less than six people there anyway, but two nights ago all hell broke loose.

I got there, there were six people in the pool and three waiting. In each lane was an  older person doing rehab exercises, water walking etc. One person gets out and another girl and myself decide to ask this lady if she'd mind circle swimming. She said no, somehow it doesn't suit the exercises she has to do. So this girl and I decide to share the side of the lane and take turns doing hundreds. Not ideal but fine. The other girl gets out a short time later and another girl asks if I mind sharing. No one else has gotten out so I say sure and we continue with the same set up as before.

Eventually old lady loses it and abuses the new girl saying she had no right to get in this lane when there were two others she could have chosen (which both still had the same set up). It turns into a screaming match between the old lady and another man who had been sitting waiting and ends with the lady making a complaint about us all.

Anyway, I guess what I'm getting at is is circle swimming an assumed unspoken rule in every country? And really, how hard is it to share a lane so people don't have to sit and wait for half an hour? Are people who aren't from a swimming background simply unaware of how these things work?

**Care to share some pics? Current, or any ‘before’ photos?**

Since I want to remain anonymous, I will not provide any photos.

**Age?** 23 **Sex?** Female

**What sports or fitness activities are you involved in?** 

I swim. I swim a lot. And I do a bunch of cross-training such as different kinds of cardio (running, elliptical, spinning), dryland (medballs, jumps, swiss ball, squats) and weights. I have been competing for about 15 years, started in a summer-only swim team and have now been on the international level for 7 years!

**What’s your story? When, how and why did you get into swimming?**

Well, I picked up swimming as a summer activity because my older brother was doing it. I was 8 years old then. I was winning most of my races so my mom decided that it would be a great sport to get involved in year long. It started as a 3-times a week activity, soon turned into my social world as I was training 5, 7 and then 8 times a week by 15 years old. My best friends were at the pool, we knew all the swimmers in our province, it was a very social thing. At about 15 I started winning more meets, making teams, traveling a lot more and it took over many aspects of my life like school, friends and other hobbies. Swimming is my lifestyle, it’s my passion and it definitely defines me now.

**Do you want to share any athletic or fitness-related goals, or any recent successes?** 

As I said, I am going to stay anonymous until I do an AMA when the time is right. My goals this year are to enjoy the ride to London, use all my knowledge and experience about the sport to my advantage and post personal best times when it matters! I haven’t done a best time since 2008, oh how I miss the full-body suits!

**What is your training regimen?** 

I have been on a varsity team for the last four years (my last varsity season just ended ☹). We swim 8-9 times a week for 2 hours, I lift weights 2 times a week, and will run forty to fifty minutes 2 to 3 times a week depending on school. On top of that, I work with a strength and conditioning coach in dryland twice a week for an hour, that’s where we’ll work on power; lots of clean and jerk, jumps, medball throws, kick boxing. It changes every week, and I absolutely love it!

**What does your diet look like? Do you take any supplements?** 

I am obsessed with food. Not in a healthy way. I have a self-imposed diet that I follow more or less depending on how close to a meet I am. Lots and lots of forbidden food: pasta, bread, cereals, rice, cheese, any sweets (chocolate, sugar, pastries, muffins, etc.), juice, red meat, peanut butter (I eat almond butter, it’s delicious), any cream, butter, dressing and I limit oil to 1 tbps a day. 

But I also contradict myself a lot in the sense that I love eating out, I usually eat out twice a week although I do not at all 1 month before a peak meet. Every day I eat the exact same thing at the exact same time. I am so anal. I limit myself to 2 fruits a day and I’ll get my carbs from oatmeal, squash, yams and home-made granola. I eat around 2,000 calories per day.

As for supplements, I have a protein shake (read 10g of whey iso protein in water) after every work out. But I used to take it all: creatine, beta-alanine, sodium bicarbonate (to buffer acid lactic) and it would make me bloated, nauseous and it’s just really really uncomfortable to take 36 pills of baking soda every day.

One thing I want to add for those as anal as me when it comes to food: it’s a mistake. Going in to World Championship a couple of years ago, my diet during taper consisted of baby carrots. No hummus. Just carrots. And 3 months before that I was eating less than a 1,000 calories/day when spending up to four times that amount. I was over-trained, exhausted, depressed and I injured myself really badly. I wasn’t able to train well at all, competing poorly and I was miserable. I have a huge issue with control and body image, but I have learned the hard way that in my sport, in ANY sport/fitness activity, you don’t win medals for being thin, you win medals for being strong and fit. So enjoy your half-baked chocolate chips cookies once in a while, won’t kill ya!

**What have you achieved so far? What are your ‘numbers’ (times, distances, etc**)? 

This is really fun but I’d rather not say too much :P

**What is your competition and/or training philosophy? What challenges do you face?** 

My training philosophy: go go go. Coaches and other athletes see me as the hard worker, I am always the first on deck and the last one to leave. I stick to my plan, I am committed and driven. I love training. I try to always do what I am scared to do. Main set is 30x50 best average? Might as well do it fly! Or the kick interval is somewhat easy? I’ll work on my breast stroke kick. I don’t feel like training today? Why not go for an extra 30 minutes of running! I am stupid. In competition, I am a nerve wreck. I used to have tears in my eyes before my races and I still shake like a leaf on the starting block. But I love that feeling. I build my confidence from my training and think of key words before and during the race. I just get into the zone!

The biggest challenge that I face is dealing with my bodily responses to stress. A week or two before a meet I’ll have stomach cramps, my legs are becoming blocks and my shoulders tighten up. I try and get extra treatment leading up to a meet, but the best way to deal with it is the chill out. I am also not a really confident person in general. I beat myself up a lot and I am never satisfied. It’s something I am working on with my sport psych and it’s getting better.

**How do you motivate yourself?** 

A lot of it is being part of a team and immense respect for my coach. I also have a strong will to “redeem” myself from failures I have experienced in the past, bad performances or races I have missed a medal/standard/record by a couple of hundredth of a second. Part of my motivation is also fueled by my desire to be thin, and if counting calories helps me get going, I think it’s ok to do it.

**How do you deal with naysayers and clashes between your lifestyle and that of your SO/friends/co-workers?** 

My dad does not approve of my priorities, obviously as my education is taking a huge toll because of swimming. But he travels to watch me when it’s really important and listens when I talk about training. I am not overly bothered by it. A lot of my team mates don’t understand why I train so much and that creates tensions sometimes. I am always the “focused” one, I never bitch about my coach and it a team environment, that’s not cool. As for my friends, they ask questions and they are interested and they support me, they try their best to understand. Also I tend to listen to them more than I talk, my best friends are not swimmers and it’s nice to get out of this world once in a while! I find it difficult to make non-swimmer friends in college though. Mostly because I do not get hammered during the week, or ever on an Olympic year, and I go to bed at 10pm every night. Loser, right? 

I am not involved in school whatsoever because I spend so much time at the pool and I wish I had more time to really experience the whole college life. And I have always dated swimmers. Now I know better!! It’s hard to maintain a good relationship with a non-athlete though, as I find that I am a rather boring person because of my commitment to the sport.

People my age generally don’t have quite the same lifestyle as mine! 

**How do you work on mental strength?** 

I believe that mental strength is at least, if not more, than 50% of any performance. I’d go ahead and say 90% but then I would feel really sad about my life and the amount of time I spend on the mere 10%.
It’s arrogance and it’s fear. You have to have the confidence to know that you are going to do well but not underestimate your opponent. You have to want it bad enough to stay motivated during training, and also relaxed enough to stay sharp during meets. And the pressure. Oh, that pressure. I feel it every single day. Sometimes it makes me throw up. Sometimes it makes me thrive. It’s mostly pressure that I put on myself, but also expectations from my team mates, my coaches and the national team. I love it and I hate it. I love it when I get to race and do well, when I am ready and confident. I hate it when I just want to hide and do my own thing, when I need to learn, when I need to make mistakes.

When I feel like I can’t cope with the stress, can’t cope with the pressure, I remember how lucky I am to care about something that much. Every day I wake up and I have a specific goal in mind, and a detailed plan to get there. It is an absolutely amazing feeling to go after something so important to me. Maybe it will never happen again in my life!

**What advice do you take, and what do you ignore?** 

I take advice from people I admire: hard trainers, my coach, anybody that do something better than me. I ignore the advice of slackers, of athletes sitting on their talent and usually I ignore what my doctor/physio says about my injuries haha.",,False,self,t5_2r0po,True,,,True,t3_rb919,http://www.reddit.com/r/Swimming/comments/rb919/swimmits_first_member_spotlight_olympic_hopeful_i/,moderator

It's a good read. You can buy it off Amazon or Kobo for $16 or so.

1363663467.0,40,self.Swimming,1akky1,Sometimes it doesn't matter how good you are. You're poison to the team and you need to go.,47,7,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/Swimming/comments/1akky1/sometimes_it_doesnt_matter_how_good_you_are_youre/,"I cut one of my best swimmers last week and have zero regrets about it now. However, I did have a moment of doubt if I made the right decision. 

""Tony"" was an excellent swimmer, had speed and endurance that could have taken him further than high school swimming. This came from years of water polo and club swim teams. His downfall? His attitude. He knew he was a big fish in a very small pond and liked to show it. Any authority figure was beneath him, including administration and faculty. He would openly undermine most practices by refusing to do sets that were ""boring"" or weren't his favorite strokes. Also distracting other swimmers from finishing their sets to ""show"" them how to correct one flaw. Normally I encourage the more senior swimmers to help the new ones, this went beyond a single tip in passing though. He tried to run a practice within my practice just to get out of doing a ""hard"" set. 

After weeks of breaking this habit, Tony quit showing up to practice regularly. If asked where he'd been, (if it was an illness of course I wouldn't hold it against anyone) immediately he would get defensive and try to justify his excuses. Some days I would have my hands full with the team i'd put the matter aside to save time. This backfired on me because some of my other swimmers were beginning to do the same thing. 

When this attitude started spreading I changed my approach. I pulled each swimmer that missed more than 2 days in a row and put a choice to them: Commit to the team or walk. I said I was done hearing halfwitted excuses. Most of these swimmers were seniors and had college/graduation stuff to focus on and I simply said find a way to balance it or quit. Decisions were made, some quit some stayed. 

Tony avoided coming to practice to avoid the conversation. He appeared at practice the day before a meet. He had been gone for 4 practices. I asked him the same question I asked the others. Tony attempted to guilt trip me into keeping him on the team. Saying it was my choice whether he stays or goes never acknowledging it was his own actions that lead him here. After a few minutes of trying to encourage him to accept responsibility, I was done. I told him it was clear he had no intentions of swimming for this school and to go  home, 

Side Note: I also coached Tony for water polo this past season. Besides being a key player, he knew I couldn't cut him from the team because we only had 7 players total. He assumed that would also protect him from getting cut from swim team.

Rule 2: Never get into an occupied land without letting the person/people already swimming know you are entering.Do this by dangling your legs into the water or standing to the side at the end of the lane when they are turning.

Rule 3: If there is only one other person in the lane, the lane should be split with each person taking half the lane. You *must* explicitly agree this.

Rule 4: Once a third person joins, circle swimming starts. Make sure both people know you are joining.

Rule 5: Circle swimming is dictated by the fastest person present, not the slowest, biggest, most ignorant or first in the lane. Take note of the swimmer's speeds before you enter. Direction is often pool specific. Check for direction signs or ask.

Rule 6: Tap feet to pass. The person whose feet are being tapped moves out of the way to the corner at the lane end. Do NOT speed up if you are being passed.

Rule 7: Move to the side to allow faster people to pass. Allow them to turn at the centre of the lane wall. if there are more than one, allow all faster swimmers behind you to pass.

Rule 8: Do NOT turn or push off in front of faster swimmers. Faster swimmers should allow slower swimmers as much time as possible before starting.

Rule 9: Do NOT start swimming immediately behind another swimmer. They will not know you are there when they are turning. Injuries will result.

Rule 10: Swimmers resting at lane end should stay as far to the side of the lane as possible.

Rule 11: If the lane has a few swimmers doing long-axis strokes (front crawl, back stroke) do NOT do short axis strokes (Breastroke, fly)

Rule 12: Be polite. Communicate. Do your best to explain the etiquette. Remember most lifeguards don't seem to know these. Most pools don't have them posted.

Edit:

Also:

Rule 13: Arm collisions occur. Live with it. If it seems to happen to you regularly, it probably means you have a ballistic (uncontrolled) arm recovery and you are the cause.

Rule 14: If there is a collision or accident, and you are the one that stops to glare at the other person, there's a very good chance you were the actual cause.

Rule 15: Cross the center line before you turn so you aren't pushing off into oncoming traffic.",,False,self,t5_2r0po,True,,,True,t3_mrw88,http://www.reddit.com/r/Swimming/comments/mrw88/mainset_of_the_week_actually_its_probably/,

Being of competitive nature, I always wanted to see what the guy next to me was doing so I could one up them. Beating them would empower me for a 100 meters or so, but inevitably I would grow tired and get burnt out prematurely.


Today I discovered that my dependency of vision only served as a distraction to my own body. What the person is doing in the lane next to you is irrelevant. Fast or slow, the only thing that matters is you.
Swimming blind today has allowed me to push myself harder, faster, and more efficient than I have ever been able to before. In some sense, being blind has allowed me to see. 


1000 meters in, I could ""see"" my body working. Stretch my arms out more, keep my core tight, keep a steady flutter kick, and remember to breath.


2000 meters in, I felt like a well tuned machine. Consistent, and aerodynamically deadly.


3000 meters -  while I am not a Buddhist, I believe I achieved what they would call enlightenment. Every stroke, every meter, I could sense every muscle fiber in my body working.  Every contraction and expansion of close to thirty muscles.  I found the following list of muscles used for the front crawl on www.swimtoslim.com:


Upper Limb:

Thenars, Brachioradialis, Flexor Digitorum Profundus, Biceps, Triceps, Deltoids


Neck:

Sternocleidomastoid


Front Trunk:

Pectorals, Serratus Anterior, External Oblique, Rectus Abdominus


Back Trunk:

Latissimus Dorsi, Trapezius, Spinus Erectors, Teres Major, Teres Minor, Rhomboid Major, Rhomboid Minor


Lower Trunk:

Gluteus Maximus, Abductor magnus


Lower Limb:

Quadricepts, hamstrings, gastrocnemius, Tibialis Anterior, Abductor Hallucius, Abductor digiti minimi, flexor digitorum brevis


Pretty amazing if you ask me, when considering sitting at a station on the gym's 2nd floor only works a couple at a time.

Eventually my body was giving me signs of exhaustion. Cramping in my feet and shoulders let me know that it was time to quit. Make it back to the end. Stop my watch. Jump out of the pool, and lift my goggles. The fog is gone. While I wasn't watching anyone else in the pool, I noticed that everyone else was keeping an eye on me. Somewhat startled as I looked at my watch. An hour and a half had already passed!

Walking back to the locker room, I felt invincible. I felt cut. I have always been a slender guy, but today I felt absolutely ripped.  After getting dressed, somebody else that was in the pool stopped me and asked where I swam in college. Considering that a year and a half ago I could barely make it 100 meters with out a rest, I took it as a well received compliment.

Will I ever be the fastest swimmer on the planet? Most likely not, but that doesn't matter to me anyways. Today I discovered my one and only adversary, my lone arch rival, and that is me.

I saw the Water Snake post and had to share this.  This is a great game for any age level and is terrifically inclusive.  It takes minimum 2 lanes (more is better) and a good number of swimmers.  Here's how it works:

[A standard double knockout bracket is used.](http://www.printyourbrackets.com/)  Swimmers are seeded randomly.  The coach needs a list of all of the swimmers best times over a 50 (or 100).  You also need pair of dice.  Start with the first matchup.

1.  Each swimmer rolls a number.  1=Fly 2=Back 3=Breast 4=Free 5=Swimmer's Choice 6=Opponent's Choice
2.  Coach looks up the times for each swimmer and calculates the time difference.
3.  The coach starts the slower swimmer first.
4.  The coach starts the second swimmer second, after the time difference.
5.  The first to touch the wall wins and advances until their is a champion.

As you can probably tell, this should shape up to be an extremely close finish.  It's an awesome game to practice racing tactics and since it's staggered, it's not about who's the better swimmer it's about who is closer to their best time.  People will usually always pick their best events to race in practice, but I've found that it often leads to people posting best times in their off events because it's advantageous much of the time to choose them.

I taught this to one of my coaches and he does it with his swimmers every second Friday now with a small prize at the end.  100% attendance almost every time.

* If you are an **Olympic class swimmer**, feel free to compress your 800 laps into a single workout or day.  You needn't cut back your practice for the week.

Recently, there has been an influx of immaturity, poor quality, and irrelevant topics to /r/Swimming. The mods have been discussing changes to improve the quality of our subreddit. As such, we have decided to enact the following rules:

* **Self posts only** - We feel that this will keep people from posting simply to gain karma, as well as making the posts as relevant to swimming as possible.

* **No more pictures or videos without a relevant context** - There have been a lot of posts recently of pictures and videos. It's great that you had a nice start at your intramural meet or took a picture with Ryan Lotche, but it does not add to the discussion. Also, just because a swimmer is in a reality TV show does not qualify them for a post here. All posts with pictures and videos should be asking for advice or from a major swim competition with a relevant article.

* **No more posts from swimswam.com** - While swimswam can be a fun read for swimming related topics, recent articles have shown clear bias, misinformation, and a lack of a journalistic approach reporting on swimming. Usually topics found on swimswam can be found at Swimming World or USA Swimming. 

* **All posts will be approved by moderators** - In the past, moderators have only responded to reports and posts in the spam filters. Going forward, every new post will be approved by the moderators. Those not conforming to new guidelines will be removed.

* **Three strikes** - If you have posts removed three times, you will be banned. This ban is not necessarily permanent, but could be depending on the severity of your offenses.

As a reminder, memes, facebook, and gawker affiliated sites are all still off limits.

Happy Belated Easter and gooday!

As a breaststroker, I felt a special connection to him, and I was a huge fan. I was so excited to see him win gold in London, when no Norwegian swimmer had ever won an Olympic medal (except for Dale Oen, silver in the 100 breast in 2008). Three days before this race at Worlds in 2011, Norway fell victim to a mass terrorist shooting resulting in 77 deaths. Dale Oen struggled with this while at Worlds, and dedicated his races to the victims, the victims' families, and to his country of Norway. A great man. He won the final of the 100 breaststroke, looking up to the sky and pointing to the Norwegian flag on his cap - that win was not for him, but for his country. He posted the fastest time since the suit ban, almost breaking the world record (which was set in a body suit). There is no doubt in my mind he would have won gold in London, in world record fashion.
On April 30, 2012, Dale Oen passed away of a sudden heart attack in Flagstaff, Arizona while taking a shower in his hotel. The Norwegian national team was training there. Norway, and the entire sport of swimming as a whole, lost one of the greatest people, and athletes it had. Rest In Peace, Alex!

The United States can wear them until June 3rd! After that the new mark 2's will be required. The times swam in the carbons will count as USA swims but they will not count for a FINA sanctioned meet or a world record. The only people that need to worry about that will be the people at Charlotte and Masters Nationals. But an Arena rep will be there with the new suits so it doesn't matter for them. Carbons will not be outright banned. They already have the mark 2's rolling off the line in full force and they are approved.


http://www.arenainternational.com/arena-waives-fina-approval-on-three-models-of-powerskin-carbon-pro_en_0_2_4875.html

Read that^ but they were banned due to a permeability issue. They are replacing all suits with the banned barcodes which is good since I have one of those. They are sending out directions for receiving a new suit that is not banned on may 13th. So it works out I guess. I get a brand new suit even though Ive worn my arena 10 times!


Just got off the phone with a great local store I know and he said that the new version wont be released for 8 weeks. But Arena is trying to ""grandfather"" the suits so if you have a suit you can wear it until the new ones come out. That is not official yet, they are just trying.

I grew up with a family of swimming. My dad was an Olympian and my mother coached numerous American Records as well as National Age Group Records. When I was two, I told my parents, ""I'm going to swim a 25 butterfly"" and I did. Throughout my career as a swimmer, I broke numerous records and was nationally ranked, but when I look back, those swims are insubstantial. 

What stands out the most to me is when I started coaching. I inherited a team of 300 swimmers. It was a summer league team that had a ton of national level year round swimmers and the previous coaches focused on catering to them. When I came in as a coach, I made an active effort to change the philosophy of the team. Instead of focusing on results, I focused on the journey. Our league had two championship meets. One for swimmers who made city times, and one for those that didn't. Instead of focusing on winning City Meet, which my team had been close to winning for three years, I implemented a system of using my national level swimmers to help teach the summer league only swimmers proper technique. We focused on being a team, the training, and progress rather than results. 

In this process, we qualified more swimmers for city meet than ever before. We had roughly 30 swimmers who weren't year round swimmers who qualified for city meet. As much as that is a great achievement, that isn't what I'm the most proud of. It was the team I took to the non-city qualifying meet.

We entered that meet favored to finish last, judging by the psych sheet. 10 weeks of hard work paid off, though. We started winning events, mostly through proper technique off the walls. They were executing perfect streamline and huge kicks. About halfway through the meet, we're a few points behind. It comes down to the relays at the end. Our 13-14 male and female kill it! Then comes the break before the 15-18 relay. The points are tallied and there are three teams which have chance of winning, one of which is ours. Our ladies lead off and have the swim of a lifetime and win. All we need is our males to finish third in order to win. 

They take off and are in an early lead. Second leg and our rivals are catching us. Then, the third leg jumps early. The hand goes up and we know that our hopes are shattered. The fourth leg jumps in and wins the race, but it doesn't matter. 

We finished tied for second. It wasn't about the results, but it was about the process. We took a team and focused on the journey. It was our passion for swimming that led us to believe we could succeed, and we did it. Instead of focusing on our failures, our team focused on the success. 

We took a group of casual swimmers and made a family. On top of that, some of those casual swimmers were awarded spots on the national team. They got full rides to NCAA D1 colleges and one of them was a few tenths from the Olympics",,False,self,t5_2r0po,False,,,True,t3_yajvj,http://www.reddit.com/r/Swimming/comments/yajvj/what_is_the_best_moment_youve_ever_experienced_in/,

Dependent on interest, it might run again during the winter (northern hemisphere).

This time I've added a T-30 option for the *sissies*.

Winner(s) will receive the Fancy Gold Trophy, named after inaugural winner CapnFancyPants, over 4.5k. The second winner was tswimson with the amazing distance of 4,750m. Last time there was no gender segregation, if there are enough this time, there will be. If we have enough entries, I may add other categories (stroke, age?). We might add some flair options.

For those for whom this is a new challenge:

* Honour system applies and rules all.
* During the month of November, you attempt a one hour or thirty time trial swim. No more, not even a second and record your distance.
* One stroke only for the time. You may stop. You may not dive.
* You can do it two more times in the month. (3 attempts total). It doesn't matter if you are swimming an hour every day. You mentally decide your attempt before you start. Not AFTER a particularly good day.
* No drafting off others. One lane, one swimmer. No paddles, fins, snorkles etc
* At the end of the month PM me your best distance for the times of the three attempts. I'll create a separate account for entries. 
* Include your stroke and the pool length (METRES ONLY, the international swimming measurement)
* At the start of December I'll post the results and we'll have a ranking.

Note: This isn't just for the fastest swimmers. 

Why would you do this?

* It's a good test of fitness and speed
* It will give you a measurement of improvement
* It is a great challenge for all levels
* Many will call it boring. That is part of the point. This is about finding out a little bit about yourself in distance events where the challenge is as much mental as physical.

* Last time we had suggestions for other options.There's still nothing stopping anyone organising something different. So it is what it is.

1368715976.0,30,self.Swimming,1egbt6,Open Water Wednesday - How far can you swim?,34,4,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/Swimming/comments/1egbt6/open_water_wednesday_how_far_can_you_swim/,"With the Northern hemisphere open water season getting underway, and temperatures in many locations edging around [the magic number](http://loneswimmer.com/2013/05/10/the-magic-number-2/), (10C/50F) , we are starting to see an increase in OW related questions.

A common question is some variation of:

&gt;*I want to swim 1.5k/3k/3k/10k, can I do it or what should I do to prepare?*

There are different answers for this depending on many factors:

1: What is your swimming experience?

2: What is you current swimming training?

3: What is your open water experience?

4: Wetsuit or not?

5: Sea, river or lake?

6: How long do you have to prepare?

Previous [Open Water Wednesdays](http://www.reddit.com/r/Swimming/search?q=open+water+wednesday&amp;restrict_sr=on) have covered some of these questions, such as Getting Started, essential rules of cold water swimmer, basic skills, swimming in different conditions.  

* To swim any significant distance in open water the first requirement is regular swimming every week. This seems obvious but some people seem to think it isn't necessary. For almost any distance from 1k up, you should probably be swimming a minimum of three times a week. If your intended swim is over 5k, three times is not enough. Less swimming experience makes building up to regular swimming should be a longer transition as sudden increases will lead to; a) injury and b) burnout.

* The second most important requirement, and one of the biggest mistakes people make, is to not get sufficient or even any open water experience before the actual event. Open water is De Facto not like a pool. Every day is different: Winds blow (or not), from different directions at different speeds in different weather conditions. Water conditions change dynamically, even during events. **You MUST get  experience beforehand**. You must practice your skills, especially sighting and navigation, but also pack swimming, rough water, fear, turns &amp; contact with other swimmers.

* **A wetsuit is NOT A SAFETY AID**. Many experienced open water swimmers feel very strongly that people substitute wetsuits for training and experience. One of the most frightening videos I've ever seen of this was 2012's [Escape From Alcatraz](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=smX3YKyYvHw). Watch it. Experienced open water swimmers view this video with genuine horror at the ineptitude on display both of swimmers and safety crew and logically therefore of the organisation. Because this isn't a really rough day by OW standards. 

**YOU CANNOT SUBSTITUTE A WETSUIT FOR TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE.** 

Just because an event allows you to enter with your limited experience means nothing. They just want your money. Events which have real qualifications requirement are not elitist. They are experienced and aware of the dangers. They are the *good events*. (Seek them out).

* You cannot safely swim 1k this week, 10k next week and do a 15k swim in the third week. Increases in training should be limited to 5% per week. That means if you swim 5,000 metres this week, in a month you will be swimming  barely over 6000m. You can prove me wrong, maybe, in the short term, but in the long term to do otherwise will lead to inevitable injury.


***BUT HOW MUCH DO I NEED TO TRAIN?***

There is no simple answer. However...

Endurance swimmers and athletes have a few rules of thumb:

*  *You can swim in a day what you swim in a week*. 

This is a reasonable guideline for medium to longer distances. I find it is most used from about 20k to 45k distances. If you are swimming these distances then you likely have your own opinion and may disagree with me. This is absolutely fine, since you know what you are doing and we all are different. If you don't have experience however, this is a reasonable rule.

This rule breaks down at the lower end. If want to swim 1k open water, you should be able to swim 1k in the pool without any difficulty and you should be swimming at least three times a week. If you struggle to swim 1k in the pool, you shouldn't be swimming open water at all.

*  *You can swim 4 times longer than your longest training swim FOR ONE-OFF EVENTS*. 

This is a very old rule. The last part means that doing this in the absence of regualar training means injury is more likely. You may get through it on grit but you won't do it regualarly.

So, I haven't given you a clear answer. That because there is no formula. 

*Open water requires training, experience and a realistic approach* (because it's dangerous and anyone who tells you otherwise is wrong).

I hope this helps some of you. Have a great season! And remember: **Safety Always!**

1309108933.0,27,self.Swimming,i9n3c,Male lane swimming rage. I don't understand you.,46,19,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/Swimming/comments/i9n3c/male_lane_swimming_rage_i_dont_understand_you/,"Just chugging along, doing 5km or so this morning at my gym when a wild 40 year old Michael Phelps appears. You guys know the kind. Drops himself assertively into the fast lane and commences thrashing, even though said energy only lasts 50 metres. Slows down to a slower, less-thrashy pace. We all keep on swimming.

Here is where I mention that I'm 5'3"" and female. I am also the proud owner of a 2:17 200m IM, amongst other things. It's been a couple of years, but I'm still in shape. I assume that even when swimming slowly, I obviously know what I'm doing: my ""slow"" pace is realistically quite fast due to a background in aerobic training. Lastly, I pride myself on lane etiquette and giving way to those who are training faster than I am. They're not difficult to spot. They're the people who catch you up.

My lane partner this morning, however, did not share the same ideas on lane swimming as I did. A minute or two after his entry to the pool, I caught him. He seemed surprised, wavering and thrashing on the wall in confusion, and he let me past. That was fine.

A few minutes later, I lapped him again, but this time with no such grace. Whirling around with me right on his toes (I didn't catch him in time to pass mid-length), he pushed off right next to me and sprinted, forcing me into the path of incoming traffic. Luckily, our one other lane partner had just gotten out, otherwise there could have been a collision.

Thrashed like an old thrashing thing as we went up the pool. Experienced Swimmitors will know that all it takes is a cheeky gear change from 3rd to 4th and you leave someone like that behind, but he didn't give up. Turning at the next wall (it's a 25m pool), he was still desperately trying to hang on. He tried for another 75m before giving up, resting for a short time before taking off right behind me again and sprinting until he could sprint no more (another three lengths).

Shortly afterwards, I went on to kicking. The guy is on the wall, and he is livid. Seriously angry. He mutters something under his breath as I go by: I didn't catch it, but by the look on his face and his mean glare that was trained on me, it was definitely not polite. He got out then, storming off the pool deck and into the locker room. I half expected him to slip on the wet steps, he was stamping down them so hard. He'd been in the pool for the grand total of about ten minutes.

I know I'm small. I know I'm female. But are some men's egos really that sensitive that it infuriates you to be passed by a woman? My size inclusive, I look the part: it would be hard to mistake me for someone who'd never swum a race in her life.

I do *not* think I deserve to receive muttered insults and evil glares because I can swim well. It's not the first time something like this has happened, which is the only reason I bring it up here. I've been called a ""bitch"" before, for sure, by a man who couldn't keep up with me. I did laugh, even though that sort of anger is a bit scary.

Please tell me I'm not the only one who this happens to, and who finds it disrespectful and unnecessary. And frightening, to think what people like that are like behind the wheel of a car.

On a related note, he'd have made a really shitty competitive swimmer. If I threw a fit every time I was beaten, I'd have spent years in tears. It's not the winning that teaches you to be good.

First, in the men’s 200 IM he swam a 2:05.13, which knocks almost a second-and-a-half off of Michael Phelps’ old record of 2:06.50 from the year 2000.

Andrew would add to that a second record in his more traditional event, the 50 free, where he was a 23.38. That broke his own record of 23.47 set earlier this year. The old record of 23.50 was set by Bolles’ Caeleb Dressel in 2011, which Andrew has now cleared twice.

Meanwhile Dressel was again rewriting the record books one day after he took Ian Crocker’s 200 meter freestyle record by going a 1:48.64. He rewrote another sprint record with a blistering 22.39 in the 50 meter freestyle at the Junior National Championships.  Dressel bettered his own 22.59 back in June.

Santo Condorelli, a teammate of Dressel’s and a USC commit, won the 50 free in 22.32. That not only won the Junior National title, but it broke the 17-18 National Age Group Record that was held by current Cal All-American Shayne Fleming, who was a 22.47 in 2009.

i first started swimming in 2007. i could barely swim 25 yards and eventually got to where i could huff and puff my way through maybe 3x100. i moved away and fell out of it and then in 2011 started again, fairly seriously for a stretch of about 5 months...swimming maybe three times a week. i felt like i just wasn't 'getting it.' although things were better, i had better balance, mostly just from doing laps floating on my back while kicking my feet with my hands at my side.

this time back, something is different. i had always struggled to swim more than six laps at a time. a grueling workout was something like 3x300. but then, it was like something just clicked. i set a goal to swim for 20 minutes straight one day, i did that. and then three swims later (today), i just kept going until i hit a mile. i jumped out of the pool 40 minutes later feeling great.

honestly i've read about technique and everything on here, and kept a lot in the back of my mind, but it was something very intangible that changed. i can't really describe it. perhaps it was just my body figuring out the right combination of speed, effort, breath, etc. that are allowing me to keep going without breaks. 

if anyone is curious, i swim basically a catch-up stroke all of the time and breathe bilaterally. my general fitness has always been fine and i'm not overweight.

1367544121.0,26,self.Swimming,1dla8v,Water Snake!!!,32,6,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/Swimming/comments/1dla8v/water_snake/,"I swim competitively on a USA swim team.  As a junior in my clubs Senior program, our practices are generally pretty tough.  Today was recovery day, so I suggested we play a new game: Water Snake.  My coach happily agreed.

There are a few rules in Water Snake:

1. Works in any pool, the larger the better.
2. The lanelines need to be removed.
3. One swimmer starts as the ""head of the snake"".
4. The remaining swimmers should remain on deck.
5. One swimmer is called by the coach to act as ""food"".  They jump into the pool, ideally as far from the ""head"" as possible. 
6. ""Food"" must remain stationary, treading water.  
7. The ""head"" swims to eat the ""food"".  The ""head"" can only move in 90 degree angles.  
8. The ""food"" is swallowed, holding their breath under water while the ""snake"" passes by overhead.
9. The ""food"" then becomes the ""tail"" of the snake.  
10. Steps 5-9 are repeated until no ""food"" remains. 
11. The last ""food"" eaten becomes the  ""head"" for the next round.
12. Repeat until all swimmers have been the ""head"" of the snake.  

The game turned out to be a very good time, requiring no-walls swimming and breath control aspects. On-deck ""food"" could do dryland exercises while they wait to be called. 

We will play Water Snake again soon!  I may post pictures in the near future!

1360781438.0,29,self.Swimming,18gk33,"Swimming rant, Please Ignore. I just need to get it off my chest.",46,17,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/Swimming/comments/18gk33/swimming_rant_please_ignore_i_just_need_to_get_it/,"Read the title, it sums it up pretty well. As a senior high school swimmer, I won't try to elude the fact that I've been having a pretty shitty month. My girlfriend broke up with me because we never had to hangout between my swim practices and her track preseason workouts. I bombed two large tests because my attention has been to getting ready for regionals. My role model, Chris Kyle, was killed. My car's breaking down more and more everyday, and I don't know if I have the money to fix it right now. Plus, my ex and me are still close, so she told me yestarday (broke up 3 weeks ago) that she wants to 'date others'. I'm not hungover her or anything, but it was kinda like ""oh...ok"" Still best friends now though. 

Why I'm writing this? Well, to be honest I don't know. I wanted to say ""oh swimming has been the best thing to me ever!"" But that isn't true. Swimming has always stood as one of my walls.

The assisant coach we have on our team is named, in this situation, AC. And our team sprinter will the SD. Now AC is so in love with SD because they know each other outside of swimming, no big deal normally. 1 thing to know about SD is that he has this weird fetish with leading, like he has to lead no matter what, even if someone else is faster. If you pass him, he'll get pissed and send his watchdog, the AC on you.

But all of the sudden SD got annoying. So I tried to stay away from him, but because I am team captain, he won't stop following me! I go insane over it. I know it doesnt sound bad, but try spending 27 hours a week with a guy you dont like for 6 months. Eventually SD realizes I cant stand him, so he starts to hate me. Still no big deal, I can handle myself in a situation quite well. He knows that so he changes his tactics. He turns AC against me. 

She wont do anything positive to me anymore. We were doing 75s Kick, Drill, DPS on a rather slow time. So me and our breaststroker kick up the interal a bit, but SD doesnt like that cause now hes going 3rd. So you know what the prick screams? He yells, ""AC! THEYRE BEING ASSHOLES!"" So she stops us and asks what were doing. We tell her the time was too slow and we kicked the time down so we would be better. She pulls us out of the water and scolds us. Then she asks why we don't respect her. We don't but we still tried to tell her that we do. After 15 minues of that she asks us again. So I said ""because you do shit like this"". Ya that one ended well.

So here we go. We now have an all out war between the corrupt AC/SD and the captain/breaststroke. And both of the teams are fighting for the a
Support of the rest of the team. Suprisingly, we won. The team all thought SD's bullshit was enough. She realized she couldn't win and thankfully she backed off. At this point Coach hears about what happened (lol little late).

So AC and SD now realize that I was elected captain for a reason and they learn they can't take me down, sorry if that sounds bad. But now the reign of terror starts on the team. Imagine that guy you hate but you cant touch. A freshman smeared shaving cream on SD's locker as a joke. SD goes straight to AC and just... I actually dont know what he says, so I wont speculate. But AC comes and scolds this freshman, he responds with a simple ""it was a joke whatever"". 

By this point everyones fed up with SD, so everyone avoids him, no one wants to.get punished for saying something mean to SD. But now SD does what ever it takes to get some power back. (On a side note, SD is a Junior and wants captain next year. The team (without my influence I promise) decided they dont want to elect him next year lol) 

Here I are now, with a teammate who hates everythong about me, an assistant coach who doesnt want me to succeed. In my opinion, thats fucked up. Ill repeat for emphazise. My assistant coach doesnt want me to succeed. 

I want to tell new swimmers that it gets better, but I dont I feel comfortable lying. It isnt that I hate life or swimming really, I may say I hate it, but in reality its done wonders for my character. I'm always happy, I always seeing the good side of stuff even when the worst shit happens, but lately ive been wondering if the now 5000 hours I have put into swimming was worth it. After getting this rant out of my system, I'd say yes. If I had to say a moral to this story it would be this: 
Swimming sucks, but at the same time, the suck makes it the sport that it is and that sport has molded me to who I am today.

Nootca's founder has previously worked behind the scenes for the major companies for the last 10 years and says you'll find their Swede version has an increased range of vision and last longer than any version in the market with its silicone straps and high quality lens. The Eleven also has a huge range of vision that beats much lager goggles in quality and comfort. The 207 is designed to beat or match the peripheral of a larger mask style goggle.

This *is* open to International applicants. (I've been hit with that restriction too often myself!).

We have always tried on Swimmit to accomodate all levels and backgrounds of swimmers, pool and open water, beginners to Olympians. As swimmers we know the friendships created in swimming are strong, lasting and enabling.

1351871387.0,25,self.Swimming,12io8f,Pie for 7000 - What makes Swimmit flow?,27,2,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/Swimming/comments/12io8f/pie_for_7000_what_makes_swimmit_flow/,"Having rolled over to 7000 subs this morning (I instantly unsubscribed myself for the fun of it), we unfortunately don't have any cool giveaways this time like the Nootca goggs at 6k.  So free pie for everyone.

I looked at 200 front page entries, to see what makes Swimmit tick. There was no pre-selection criteria, nothing was eliminated, but a few were impossible to categorise given the initial criteria. Some obviously appeared less than I expected, only having 1 entry per category, where a couple of others could have had criteria, all those figures are probably a maximum of 3 occurences in 200.

[Big pie](http://imgur.com/akxZW).

You can see that 38.5% (minimum) of all posts fall into a request for help, or some type, and of pretty much the whole range of abilities. If I added set requests that number becomes 46%! 


If I break out the help requests to more categories, Stroke, Speed, Endurance, Meet, Gear, Coach, Dryland and still retaining a general category it becomes a bit more clear. 

[More slices](http://imgur.com/9LXqj).

Some things are time centered. If I had done this to include August, the entire landscape would have been different to account for the Olymics. In this analysis the time dependent feature is of people starting or returning to school (mostly) or college (less) swim teams.

On the other hand, triathlon and open water requests are low, though they are never very high, as we enter the winter season for the northern hemisphere.

Also for the period sampled, WOD, workout of the day suggestions were high as we had a short-lived member submitting quite a few over a two week period. However submitted workouts are generally low and votes generated are rarely higher than 10 (but irrelevant anyway since they are self posts). 

* More WOD would be good. Can I suggest  [WOD], [Workout] or [Wworkout of the Day] as titles , which makes the sidebar link easier?

* General news of well known pool swimmers continue to be popular weighted heavily toward American swimmers. I haven't done a gender comparison, it would be interesting.
* Swim culture is a term I used to collate posts of general discussion and questions by obviously experienced swimmers, that aren't requests for help. This means our shared culture of shared experience 
* The number of set requests is very high, given that the sidebar has contained quite a few resources since the early days, but more people are browsing from phones, and sidebars are occasionally invisible depending on app or browser.
* Quite a few people keep asking the same related questions about music players or music for swimming.
* Lots of people ask for stroke help. This will always be true.
* People like meeting their heroes. It's exciting for you, it may not be as exciting for others to hear about it. But maybe it will. Ask yourself if it adds anything. 
* Considered swim humour posts do well. We all appreciate a laugh. Memes are still banned.

The set itself: An indeterminate number of 100s, all on the 2:00 (2:00 *should* give you plenty of rest). 

The catch? The first 100 you have to swim a 1:45 or better. The second 100 you have to swim a 1:44 or better. The third 100 you have to swim a 1:43 or better. Keep going and going until you *literally cannot make it*. For instance, my best 100 yard time is :59.97. My goal is to do at least 46x100s.... meaning that last 100 I'm trying to do a 1:00. The end is hard. #45 for me would be me trying to go only a second slower than my fastest time ever. But that's the point! It's supposed to be a *challenge*.

1294333604.0,24,self.Swimming,exc0x,The Flip Turn,26,2,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/Swimming/comments/exc0x/the_flip_turn/,"I noticed a lot of new people to r/swimming and I haven't seen any post explaining the flip turn. I will try to explain it the best I can and hopefully others will add to this.

Why do the flip turn?
The main reason is that you can swim much faster using this method versus a wall touch or grab. I however, mainly use it to train more effectively. For me, when i use the flip turn, I am not tempted to stop on the walls as much and it doesn't afford me that ever so slight break that grabbing the wall does. I find it also helps with interval/ set workouts since I am able to be more consistent w/ respect to time using a flip turn, whereas my time w/ a wall touch can vary to the point where I am unsure if I am swimming faster or performing a faster turn.

How to preform the flip turn?
While looking for videos explaining how to do this I came across a goswim series.

[part 1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFQpLyihI5M)
[part 2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryN-4R1E8d8)
[part 3](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHXNBbLFiJs)
[part 4](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNQh2SqA2Ck)
[part 5](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss6-htcF9mA)

These videos are excellent, and alone should be enough to get the basics down. I also wrote up a brief statement on how I learned the turn, since I didn't have the advantage of this video set.
 
When I was learning the most difficult part for me was the somersault. Once I had that down I could preform the w/ almost no additional instruction. In order to master the somersault my coach had us the team swim a set were we had to somersault three times each length. It was very awkward but it helped teach my muscles what to do.
To do a somersault while swimming, tuck your chin down to your chest and bring your knees up, you will now be in a fetal position. If you do this with some forward momentum you will spin. It helps to think that you are throwing your face down. This video below is more in-line with how I was instructed on the turn.

[Short video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kK9mm39uHZ8)

Use which ever method you works best for you. I recommend the goswim videos. Remember its an awkward movement at first, and good luck.



**Edit**

**floor markings**

I forget to mention the lane markings, and how they are used. In most pools (every pool I have swam in) there are lines along the floor of the pool. Near the walls there is a cross, or t shape. The purpose of these is to help swimmers gauge when to start their flip, without having to look up at the wall. To use them being the turn when you are passing over them. You will have to experiment with this to find the sweet spot. Remember this spot will change depending on how fast you swim and how tight you make your tuck. (if you flip to late you can always tuck tighter).

**Backstroke**

Also, if you are feeling comfortable with the turn you can use it for backstroke as well. For backstroke you simply flip on to your stomach and take your last arm pull leaving both arms at your sides and flip. The trick here is knowing when to flip. In racing you are only allowed one stroke on your stomach. To find the sweet spot for backstroke start at half pool and swim to the wall. When you pass under the flags count how many strokes it takes to get to the wall(stay on your back the entire time). You should go slow the first time and/or have someone help so you don't crash into the wall. Then once you have your count, subtract one and that is when you flip to your stomach. The flags should be the same distance from the wall for every pool since there are regulated by racing rules.

**tricks**

* If you get water up your nose while you are spinning upside down, you most likely will, just breathe out thru your nose. It doesn't take a lot of air to keep water out, just a steady stream. If you struggle with this then as the video suggests you can try a nose clip. (I have no experience with these, so I can't speak to their usefulness)

* to help get the rotation/spin, imagine splashing yourself in the face with water. I couldn't find a good video or image of this so bear w/ me as I try to explain this. When you tuck your chin in and start to rotate your head will move towards back and up towards your arms/ hands. Just try doing this now standing or sitting, you can also refer to a video were the full flip turn is shown, try to find an underwater shot. So as you see your head naturally goes toward your hands. What you want to do is then imagine that you are using your hands to splash water in your face. If done correctly this will also help you set up for your stream line off the push. However you want to remember that your abs should be doing the work - like the instructional video said - but this could help beginners and those looking to speed up their turns.
See [spartanKid](http://www.reddit.com/r/Swimming/comments/exc0x/the_flip_turn/c1bqlzr) and [enderx475](http://www.reddit.com/r/Swimming/comments/exc0x/the_flip_turn/c1bpu97) comments' for different explanations.

* Once you have the basics mastered, start adding fast underwater dolphin kicks. This technique is a must if you are going to be racing. If you are not racing I still suggest working on this since it works abs and breathing. For an example check out [Phelps'](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9eDAQxL5cA) turn, note that the video is slow motion, you should be doing these fast.

Thank you all for filling out the survey. I have some good news and bad news. The good news is that as of yet, 236 people want to buy caps. That is sufficient enough to get an order done. 

The bad news is, I wasn't specific in my questions, so I don't know how many of you who want the caps live in the continental US (for shipping) or have a verified PayPal address. What's likely to happen is that someone is going to have to do the order then ship out each cap(s) separately. Shipping costs to out of country are going to vary, so the price will vary by country. 

Before we go further and I do another survey, we need to decide on a design so that I can get it over to Reddit legal and a few vendors I've worked with in the past so make sure they'll be able to print it. 

Send in your submissions and/or post them here. Anyone have an idea of how long would be fair to wait for submissions? Once we get them all, I'll toss them up on a survey so we can vote on which we'll be going with this year.

1354805300.0,25,self.Swimming,14dv79,[WOD]The Red Mist (endurance threshold),31,6,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/Swimming/comments/14dv79/wodthe_red_mist_endurance_threshold/,"This set originally comes from Paul Newsome (swimsmooth) and is designed to increase your threshold swim speed for endurance and distance swimming. 

Simply it's descending 400s:

* 4x 400m at threshold pace + 6 sec /100m
* 3x 400m at threshold pace + 5 sec /100m
* 2x 400m at threshold pace + 4 sec /100m
* 1x 400m at threshold pace + 3 sec /100m

Take 20 secs rest after *every* 400.

So you need to know your threshold speed. 

How do you measure your threshold pace?

You need to do a 400m and 200m time trial. Do the 400 first as it is less likely to interfere with the 200. Take plenty of rest inbetween.

Threshold is calculated first in meters per second by this formula

(m/sec) = (400 - 200) / (T400 - T200)

where T400 &amp; T200 are the 400 &amp; 200 times in seconds.
Then divide 100 by your m/sec result and you have your threshold speed per 100m in seconds. (It's very easy to plug into a spreadsheet, which is useful for tracking).

  
For example: 

if your 400 time is 7 minutes and your 200 time is 3.30, then your m/s threshold is (400-200)/(420-210) which is 0.95 metres per second, which works out at 105 seconds, which is 1 min 45 secs per 100 threshold speed. (Round up to full seconds).

Then for each set, you add the additional time to each base 100. 

This set will see you decreasing time, increasing speed and most importantly, you should be maintaining stroke form as you do so. You should NOT be starting out hard and having lots of time in the first ones, but coming in on or close to the time.

Important: Retest your threshold speed every 4 weeks, do this set once a week.

If 4k is too much, you can start with less repetitions of 400.

If you have a Tempo Trainer, you can use it to set the repeat for every lap. This will allow you to swim at the correct lap time every time.",,False,self,t5_2r0po,False,,,True,t3_14dv79,http://www.reddit.com/r/Swimming/comments/14dv79/wodthe_red_mist_endurance_threshold/,

And finished with fly FTW. Last mile was my second fastest after the very first mile (though hardly blazing fast at 25 mins). 

I was mostly ok to about 9 or 10 hours, a bit up and down for  a while, mile 14 was great, 15 was tough, 16 was ok, 17 was bad, 18 was the worst, losing a couple of minutes per mile for each of the two. And it was ok to good from there on, getting faster for the last 3. 

4 started, 1 DNF. 

3 of the 4 are all experienced long distance swimmers (1 didn't finish, the rookie did). Planning and ancillary preparation was good. Chlorine very low in pool was the most important fact of the day.

Best thing? The pool (not our local) took us very seriously, were very accommodating instead of treating us (as usually happens) like the freak and outsiders of the swimming world.

All that I'm sure, is more information than you wanted when you asked for an update. I think I'll take a couple of days off training!

Edit: relevant information for swimmers that I forgot while tired writing this. Normally on long swims, I completely forget about stroke after 5 or 6 hours. Because of the location and time structure, I was able to think about stroke regularly. I started at 18 strokes per length (yeah, yeah, I know, should be better). I dropped to 19/20 by about 8 hours when I thought to check. By 14 hours when I remembered to check again, I was down to 22, and those missing 4 strokes seemed impossible. Of course it's primarily muscle contraction. I did more stretching than the others, but not until about 2/3rds of the way through. For one 1000 metre stretch around 15 miles, I started gliding like it was 1945 and I was invading Normandy, and got back to 20 but the stress on my neck caused me to stop.

Recovery: No problem, didn't sleep during Sunday. Slept deeply on Sunday night. Recovery was a doddle compared to a Channel swim. I'm going swimming today but generally feel fine. One friend (who is a Channel relayer and was my EC crew chief) asked me to scale it in comparison to the English Channel. If my Channel was 10, then this was a 5 or 6 max.

First off I want to say hi to all the new subscribers that have popped up because of the Olympics.  I hope you stick around.  Second I want to say give a big THANKS! to the mods for keeping spoilers off the front page and for all the work you have done over the past months getting this sub back up and active.

But I wanted to take the time to look back on what we just experienced and get your opinions on what you expected or are looking forward to in the next few years.

**Phelps**

I hope everyone enjoyed what they witnessed in London.  I know I sure did.  Michael changed our sport forever.  It will never be the same and we owe him the biggest thanks.  If you want to say thanks I think the best way would be to donate what you can to [The Michael Phelps Foundation](https://www.facebook.com/MichaelPhelpsFoundation) which promotes the sport of swimming amoung young people.  

**Lochte**

I think given the expectations many people will say that this was a disappointing meet for Lochte despite bringing home multiple medals.  To me the only real disappointment was his 3rd place in the 200 Back.  But I'm curious to see what the rest of swimmit thinks.

**The Next Generation**

Despite losing Phelps we as Swimfans have a lot to look forward to.  With the rise of Franklin, Ledecky, Adrian, Ye Shiwen, le Clos, Meilutyte &amp; others we see a changing of the guard.  I can't wait to see how far these swimmers can go to set new WRs over the next few World Championships and in Rio.  **Who is swimmit pulling for over the next 4 years?**

**WRs, No Suits, &amp; Doping Allegations**

There were 9 WRs in the 32 events in London.  That was a lot more that I expected.  I expected maybe 1 or 2.  I'm curious as to what swimmit thought was going to happen before the games and how they feel now.  I think we have to admit to ourselves that the suits had less of an effect than we thought.  (At least in longer events).  It really is the increased training and improved techniques that have driven swimming forward over the last decade.  3 of the 9 records in London came in 100-meter events, 3 at 200 meters, two at 400 and one at 1,500 (And a just miss in the 800).  I just did a quick count in my head so let me know if I missed or added one.  Makes me very excited for the next few years.

As for the doping allegations against the young swimmers Ye Shiwen &amp; Ledecky.  I'll admit that I was skeptical after the first night and Ye Shiwen's smashing of a suited record.  But after seeing that the suited records aren't nearly as untouchable as I expected I accept that all those swimmers that participated in London are clean.  They are until it's proven otherwise.  But it is a part of modern athletics.  All modern athletes will have to deal with it.  It think it's best dealt with with things like Project Believe, a project by the United States Anti-Doping Agency in which U.S. Olympians can volunteer to be tested in excess of the World Anti-Doping Agency guidelines.  Phelps has been involved since Beijing and I hope all these up and coming swimmers get involved so we can put these arguments to bed.  

**Just a few more questions for swimmit**

**What for you was the best story of these Olympics?**

I hope to get lots of different answers for this but for me it involved Phelps.  But not him getting the most medals or finishing as the best swimmer ever.  It involves his loss in the 200 Fly.  I love the fact that le Clos has been inspired by Phelps for almost a decade and all he wanted was to be in the same pool as his idol.  Not only did he get that chance but he chased down his hero to out touch him on the last stroke of the last swim in Phelps' best event.  And then watching him barely hold it together for the interview was amazing.  You can't make up a better Olympic story.  

**Possible Changes for future Olympics?**

If I were in charge I would add a 4x200 Mixed Freestyle Relay.  2 men &amp; 2 women swimming 100 free.  I would also have both men and women swim both the 800 free and the 1500.  There is no reason that they shouldn't both swim both events.  There are world records in the men's 800 and women's 1500.  Just swim the 800 on the first day and the 1500 on the last.  Give the distance swimmers a chance to recover and have more than one event.  What does swimmit think?

**Biggest disappointment in the 2012 Olympics?**

For me it was the U.S. coaches.  I don't think they did a very good job on either 400 Free relay.  Small nitpicking but that's what it was for me.  What about you swimmit?  

**Tl;DR  I'm a huge swimming nerd.  I would appreciate it if you would answer some of the questions in bold and give me your opinions.**",,False,self,t5_2r0po,False,,,True,t3_xpokz,http://www.reddit.com/r/Swimming/comments/xpokz/looking_back_at_this_past_week/,

I enjoy weightlifting and I want to get as strong as possible, but I want to train endurance to be able to surf well.  Wouldn't it be overtraining if I were to lift weights and swim the next day?  If I workout anything like chest, shoulders, triceps, back, or biceps, anything really upper body, I end up doing the same thing the next day so where is the recovery?

How do you prevent overtraining in this instance?  Am I underestimating the human body?  How should I eat to prevent overtraining?

#6-10: strong, solid pace @ 1:30

#11-20: fast pace @ 1:20 (keep a steady average!)

Both are hard (sorry!) but both are excellent workouts for building up endurance- good for all kinds of swimmers (yes, even you sprinters). Distance swimmers should have a nice long warmup before doing the set. Sprinters- start off with this set, then do a nice long warm down set.

EDIT 2:  ....and on that note:  31 year old male.  5'11 9/10"", 190lbs (muscley)
Currently:

M,W,F: Drop-in masters team at 6am, 2hr dryland at 5pm, 1-1.5 hours in the pool there after (drills usually)

T-Thr:  Doubles swimming (1-2 hours each)

S: Open water swim, Yoga, Stretch

Best times so far:

500 Free (SCM):  5:32

50 Free (SCY):  25 low (off the wall, no blocks/dive)

50 Fly (SCY):  25 low (off the wall, no blocks/dive)

50 Breast (SCY): 31 high (off the wall, no blocks/dive)

50 Back: Don't ask



Not great with distance, but I can hold 1:25's of 100 flys (SCY) for an hour+ (in long course it becomes 1:35)

Again, so far no coach, no teams, no lessons, just showing up to the pool.  Looking to improve fly time especially

---------

 * Ze goggles, ze do something. Definitely get [goggles](http://jusbytheclown.files.wordpress.com/2007/10/bajagoggles.jpg), maybe the tinted ones if you plan on swimming outside

 * Drag force is massive. You can't get very far with poor form in this sport (unlike cycling or running) 

 * Good form comes with practice and feedback.  Biggest thing to remember is that you want your body to flow through the same segment your head and arms passed through. I'm not going to explain form any further since I still suck at it [watch videos instead](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2n_AceCr-c)

 * That burning your nose gets will when water enters it will go away. Maybe after about a few weeks of swimming. 

 * Don't bother purchasing jammers for a while. Just swim in whatever you like. Consider it a ['drag suit'](https://www.google.com/search?q=swimming+drag+suit&amp;hl=en&amp;prmd=imvns&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=fjH-T43eE8LJ6wHH4Z3JBg&amp;ved=0CEUQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1745&amp;bih=890). My triathon captain would often wear a drag suit. My swimsuit had about 3 times the drag factor, and it had cool pockets with zippers.  

 * Getting down breathing takes a while, but it happens. It took me a while to realize you can breathe out while still underwater so you can have a faster stroke. 

 * You can use your whole arm to pull yourself through the water, not just your hands

 * swimming  in a straight line is hard, even harder if you only breathe from one side

 * I don't wear swimcaps (yet). takes too long to put on and pulls on your hair

As a swimmer, swimming is not just a sport, it is so much more. Swimming is a passion, swimming is determination at it's finest. We all know the feeling, the way your muscles tighten and as a set progresses you come closer and closer to the point of physical exhaustion. As you reach the point of physical exhaustion, thoughts come into your head, “why am I doing this?” or “I could be at home doing something fun, instead why am I here killing myself at practice?”. We practice till our body aches because we, as swimmers have passion, determination, the will to push through the pain because we know this pain will all pay off in the end. As you swim a race and your instincts take control, your adrenaline pumps through your body, each stroke is an instinctual explosion as you tear through the water. On your last lap of the race you can see the finish, your body is in shambles, you ache you feel as if you cant go on. But the finish is in sight you somehow manage to pull out that last ounce of energy left in your body and finish strong, as you hit the wall catching your breath is not your first objective, you quickly pull of your goggles and look over at the board, you begin to swell with pride and an overwhelming feeling of joy comes over you, you just swam your best time ever, you shake the hands of your opponents. As soon as you exit the pool your swarmed by your team, they all cheer for you and praise you, even those who swim the same event cant help but be happy for you knowing you would do the same for anyone of your teammates. The team is not just your team they are your best friends, they are your family. This is what swimming is, a single word or phrase cant begin to summarize it. Swimming is truly unlike any sport it changes you as a person and instills in you a will to succeed that can be applied to any aspect of life.

1307886354.0,19,self.Swimming,hxrfz,Nightswimming,24,5,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/Swimming/comments/hxrfz/nightswimming/,"It was my first night swim since the EC. Like many sea swimmers I love night-swimming. Just after midnight on Sunday morning, 16 experienced Sandycove swimmers took to the water in three groups to do a full lap of [the island](http://imgur.com/IBLWO).

The water had been cold on my stretch of coast all week, from 9.5C to 11C. The swim had looked doubtful only 24 hours earlier with south-west winds of 35 knots predicted. But the morning sea-area forecast showed a window of opportunity before the wind came up.

We all arrived around 11.30pm. The long northern latitude twilight had finally bowed to night, and it was getting cloudy and covering the half-moon. Good, it would be darker. Night-swimming isn't the same unless it's really dark.

I live the furthest away, but I know the island like the back of my hand, as does everyone else in the group. This would be my 99th lap of the island, though compared with others, it's a small number, with some of them having over five hundred or a thousand laps done, over many years. (After my next lap I'm a member of the 100 Club).

I was sure The Queen had done night laps before, but she said that whenever she had tried during her Double English Channel training, the weather hadn't co-operated, even during her overnight training swim, (the only one of us ever to have a done a full night swim ... in training). It seemed it had never been done. This island scares some people in the daytime.


This night swim was different to the usual annual training event which happens inside the island. This was around the outside of the island in full dark. The wind was coming up and instead of south westerly, it was south easterly, meaning the chop would be coming into our faces rather than from behind.

This was also special. Night-swimming, with friends. The Queen, the Hun, The Bull, The Yank and others, and a few people I didn't know. Missing however were other friends, two of them now on the other side side of the world. 

Night-swimming in one of the world's great swimming locations. What more could a swimmer want? (Warm water, daylight and an absence of pointy rocks you say? Psah!)

The Yank gave a safety briefing. We were divided into three groups so we would be finishing roughly together, with quick assemblies at the first and second corners. The Hun and I would buddy up, him with a blue light on his head, I with green.

We entered the water just after midnight. The people who'd never done a real night swim were given a minute or two to see if they felt okay. At the last minute The Yank decided we all needed a nightmare and decided to forego his togs. I shudder still. But I understand the motivation.

Even the colder water at the slipway felt a bit warmer than home, maybe 11C. The Yank and C_, fastest present, took off after the two first slower groups and the Hun and I followed last.

I know from talking to people that many are horrified at the thoughts of anything touching them underwater. I imagine the thought of it happening in complete blackness is worse, Though it was high tide, we swam through the invisible kelp on the inner reef on the way out to the first corner and I thought how it would scare those people.

We stopped at the first corner, The Hun had had a problem with his goggles and needed to adjust. Given the experience of the group, everyone was wearing clear goggles. The first few hundred metres out, eyes were adjusting from the glare of the car light at the slipway so it seemed particularly dark at the start.

At the first corner we could feel the growing chop from the wind, but the water also felt warmer. I don't know why, but water always seem to feel warmer in the dark. Leaving the corner on the outside of the island the few lights of Sandycove disappeared. 

We swam to the second corner, The Hun on my left side, everyone giving the dangerous second corner plenty of space, for once.

The moon was hidden in clouds behind us. The world consisted of only a few colours. The neon greens, oranges and blues of the few swim lights I could see. The Hun always to my left, and only a few glimpses of lights in front when we crested the occasional wave at the same time. The skyline of the far side of the island was black against a sky of the deep charcoal hue of 242424ff. The water beneath was void.


And in the void was one of the reasons we love night swimming, the efflorescent green sparking diadems of [bioluminescence](http://earthguide.ucsd.edu/hughes2001/acct/msoto/images/mushroom2.jpg) corruscating from our fingertips. 

We hit occasional kelp. The Hun hit a buoy on the inside of the island and I hit ropes twice causing us both to laugh. The last hundred metres to the slipway was the usual hammer of cold water from the stream outflow. I didn't even see the one boat I knew was moored outside the slipway. 

I've swam for hours in the dark. There is something zenlike about it. It is utterly exhilarating and calming at the same time. This was only thirty minutes of heaven.

It's been a cold week in Ireland, snow on the Kerry mountains and hailstones in the midlands. The wind was stronger, and stripped the heat really quickly from everyone as they changed, leaving us all much colder after a mere thirty minutes than we would normally be in mid June.

An almost cold hot chocolate from my flask shared with my *swimmin wimmen* friends in the car with a delicious bun handed from someone in the dark. And then the long drive home.",,False,self,t5_2r0po,True,,,True,t3_hxrfz,http://www.reddit.com/r/Swimming/comments/hxrfz/nightswimming/,

Fast forward to now, our coaching staff announced today that he will be a part-time coach and mentor for all levels of our relatively small club. He's really awesome and friendly and wished me luck at our upcoming Senior Championship meet! I feel pretty awesome and want to gloat... haha

oh and if you don't know who chip peterson is... here

I'll keep it short.

Basics about me:  I'm not fast, about 31 mins for 1600m, and I do a mediocre to slow open turn.  I'm swimming for triathlon training, so the turn isn't a great concern, but my endurance is.

Problem:  Sometimes I can get in the pool and get a mile+ in no problem, but other times, like this AM, I find my heart rate climbing after 400m and I begin to get out of breath.  I try to pace myself and calm down, but usually to no avail.  I end up taking a 20 second break and then going back at it.  And after I do this I'm usually good for the remainder of whatever distance I am swimming that session.

So it seems I'm just starting at too hard of a pace, which is a problem by itself, but how do you guys settle down when you start to feel this coming on?  I worry if this happens to me in open water I will have to pull up and calm down, which is something I really want to avoid.  Endurance and fitness don't *seem* to be the issue, it's just that beginning of the swim which is a roll of the dice for me.

So to put it plainly.. when you start to get short on breath and your heart rate picks up too quickly, how to you keep stride and calm down? ",,False,self,t5_2r0po,False,,,True,t3_1802ec,http://www.reddit.com/r/Swimming/comments/1802ec/how_do_you_calm_down_while_swimming/,

They haven't won a title in something like 35 years, and this season, they were on fire. They won every dual meet, sections, etc. and were prepared for a win going into state. Everything went great, the girls won a couple individual events and did pretty well in everything else, and were ahead by about 40-50 points going into the last event (4 x 100 freestyle relay).

During that final 4 x 100 relay, every girl had a fantastic swim and they got a state record. However, as they prepared to get the trophy and take a big team picture, something was discovered (this is where my second-hand, not first-hand information starts, as I left the pool once it was announced that we had won). The coach of the team had forgotten to update the relay order card for the 4 x 100 relay. The order for prelims and finals does not have to be the same, so we swam a couple different girls in each race, a completely legal action, however a form must be submitted documenting the changes. Since the form was not submitted, the relay was disqualified, the forty points awarded for first place were removed, and the state record was stripped on the spot. Nevertheless, they were still ahead by a few points, and the team took pictures and began to leave. It was around this time a reporter from a local newspaper asked an official if they were certain the forms had been submitted for the other relays. They were not.

Because of this, many more additional points were stripped from our team (relays count double and we did pretty well in the other two),  and we were moved down to fourth. The trophy was given to the second place team, and no further recognition was given to our high school.

Back at the school, everything was incredibly emotional. The incredibly strong senior team that propelled us to victory knew they were graduating this year without winning a state title during their four years. They were crying (understandably), but in an incredible show of respect and love, there were no insults or hard feelings directed at the coach by parents or students. He was new last year, and had helped move them from a team that barely placed at state to a runner up team last year and now a championship winning team. The only thing they didn't have was the title, stripped from them by a simple clerical error that really should have been reviewed by at least some official or assistant before the meet even started.

After the dinner, the team went back to a captain's house for a sleepover. While they were there, the team that ended up winning the title showed up at the house, with a handwritten note of apology and a bunch of freshly made cookies. No negative outbursts were seen, and the fact that the other team took time to do this for them was truly inspiring. All in all, it was a crazy experience that I wanted to share.

Base your intervals at your own pace. I will be having my swimmer hold a golf ball on the 50 drill for every 100 in this set. The idea is to get him using his forearm to pull water. I am really focusing on the first third of the pull and the last third. A lot of people (on the first 1/3 of the pull) pull straight down- causing the body to pop up &amp; on the last 1/3 of the pull- people pull straight up (body drives down). This cycle can be vicious when both arms are constantly doing this. 

*focus on finishing your pull past your suit/hip. Extend your elbow after every pull to the point where your triceps are getting tired. That is a sign you are pulling a lot more water with every pull (you should feel more of a boost if done properly)*

Hello fellow swimmers

My name is Ryan and I've been in love with swimming ever since I was born. I was also born with a hearth problem and as such, I've never really grown into a great sportsman. I had surgery when I was 7, though, but even afterwards, the only sport I loved enough to continue was swimming.

It is only recently (a month or two ago) that I made a point of it to go swimming 3 times a week. I'm currently at 1 km in about half an hour, doing continuous breaststroke with a short break after every 250 metres. 

Since I can't do front crawl, I was under the impression that this was the only good workout I was able to. Until I went to get new goggles and I realised there were hand paddles, fins, blocks that you could between your legs and so on. And I realised that maybe I could get more out of my weekly swims by switching it up a bit.

(TL;DR:) So my question is, for someone who, at the moment, swims 1 km in about half an hour without any big problems but who also wants to strengthen his muscles and get some endurance, what could be a good way to proceed? I can always use hand paddles, fins, etc. and I can also pay for a teacher to teach me front crawl if that would be a good idea.

Thanks for the help!

I know the stroke basics, have decent technique, and my endurance is okay(I have been mainly focusing on fly lately, and I can do 200s but I need about a minute rest between sets of 200s). 

So, on to the actual questions. 

-Do you have any workouts or workout ideas(in or out of the pool) that you think would help prepare me for the intensity of the workouts that I will have to do on the team?(Currently I get swim workouts off the internet, but I have to increase the intervals pretty often. Not drastically, but I do have to increase some). For a decent measure of my endurance, yesterday I did a set of 10 x 100s @ 2:00 where the first 50 was fly and the 2nd free. I made the interval every time, but it was nearly a continuous swim(I had 3-8 seconds rest after every one) and I was exhausted afterwards, but I did complete it. Another set that really tired me out was a set of 20 x 50s @ 1:00 alt free/back.

-Do you have any tips or advice so I don't look like a complete fool? Things like swim etiquette, what exactly I should be expecting in terms of workouts, tryouts, etc.  I will obviously be the 'new kid', and I don't want to be that newbie who does everything that all the other swimmers have known not to do for years! 

If you want any more information, like my best times, examples of my usual workout, etc., to help answer any of these, let me know.

Thank you so much for reading/responding!",,False,self,t5_2r0po,False,,,True,t3_1eb5mg,http://www.reddit.com/r/Swimming/comments/1eb5mg/joining_high_school_swim_team_for_the_first_time/,

So I decided to do the 100*100 workout today and just kind of went for it with no prep.  Ended up losing gas hard at 65 and stopped at 70 and I think it's because I didn't prepare (and maybe not in the best of shape). So some questions for anyone who has done it: Do people swim right through or take a break every 20 or 30 sets?  Do you sip a mouthful of water every once in a while or just wait until a break?  Do you eat before?  Do you even eat during (a bar or something if you get out to take a break).

By the way, TGChulhu is not as ugly as his name might suggest.

The week (for me) was approximately 100k in 8 days in open water topped off by a 6 hour qualifying swim (to qualify to swim the channel) in ~52f water, no wetsuit.  I have never done anything like it before and it was mentally probably the hardest thing I have ever done.

Probably the worst part was hour one because I was cold, it was low tide so you are swimming through plants, and I couldn't shake the little voice in my head that said ""You've got five more hours of this.""  

I fed every 25-30 mins ago thanks to volunteers with bottles of Maxim or Perpetuem on hand.  About 3 hours in a seal popped up next to me and scared the shit out of me.  There had been reports of seals biting in the area so I yelled at him, shook my fists, splashed (yeah, I splashed a seal, I could just see him laughing at me) but he swam away.  The adrenaline that he gave me got me through the fourth hour.  Then there were two hours left and I knew I would finish.  

I had been acclimatizing for months now and although it was cold, I was never over the edge of being hypothermic.  But it was uncomfortable pretty much the whole way.  The only reprieve was a warm spot now and again but they just made the cold seem colder.  The worst were the really cold spots inside the cold spots.  

But thanks to TheGreatCthulhu and some of his fellow ~~torturers~~ volunteers I made it.  

Fortunately or unfortunately I learned after the swim that because I am swimming the Channel in 2012, I will have to do the qualification swim again because you have to do it in the same year as your swim.  

Oh well, it's one of those great experiences that I am glad is over, this time.  

I appreciate all of the support I get from Reddit.  I can honestly say that were it not for Reddit, I would not be swimming the Channel.  I'll leave you with this:  ""Whatever you can do, or dream you can do, begin it.  Boldness has genius, power, and magic in it."" - William Hutchison Murray (incorrectly quoting Goethe)

These are useful if you get a copy of someone’s plan or find some on the ‘net, where there are plenty to be found.

* So, in swim code, all the strokes have abbreviations:

**FR** or **f/s** or **f/c**: Front crawl 

**BK** or **b/c** : Backstroke

**BR** or **b/s** : Breaststroke

**fly** or **FL**: Butterfly

**IM** : Individual Medley, which is 1 length (or more) of: fly, b/c, b/s, f/c in that order

**kk** or **kick**: kick only, (usually with a float) , not using arms

**pull**: swim using a pullbuoy between the legs

**Pad/paddles** : Use paddles on the hands

**Pull &amp; pad** : Use both pullbuoy and paddles

**UW** Underwater

* Some other common terms-

**Set**: one particular group of swims. Like 10x100m is a set of 1000 metres, made up of ten 100metre swims. 

Sometimes though *Set* may be used by people to describe the whole day’s training, but *Session* is preferred as the overall term.

**RI** : Rest Interval, the amount of time between swims

**Neg. split** : Do the 2nd half of a set faster than the first half

**Br** : Stop and Breathe for a specific period ( e.g 200 f/c br 5 every 50 means swim 200 /fc stopping every 50 metres to breathe for 5 seconds).

**EZ** : Swim easy

**WU /  WD / SD** : Warm Up, Warm Down, Swim Down (Swim Down means Warm Down).


**Bi-lat** : Bi-lateral breathing (breathe to both sides)

**4l/4r** : Breathe every 4 (or whatever number the set specifies) to the left or the right.

**Desc.** : Descending. Reduce the interval between sets, can sometimes mean reduce the time for the set.

**MI**; reverse I.M. sequence

**IMO or IM Order**: One repeat of each stroke (4x100 IMO =100 fly, 100 back, 100 br, 100 fr) 

**IMO by round**: 4x(3x100) IMO by round = 3x100 fly, 3x100 back, 3x100 br, 3x100 free

There are some other things like l/s, r/s meaning do left and right-side lateral drills. Catch-up, also meaning a specific drill but I’m guessing if you know those things then you’ll already understand all this.

**Examples**

Something like; 

- f/s 40×100 @ 1:40

Means: “Do front crawl, 100 meters, repeat the 100 metres 40 times, starting each time after 1 minute and 40 seconds (for a total of 4,000 metres).” 

(This is a popular set with distance swimmers, where you put any number in for 40, up to 200.)

In this case the rest is determined by how much under 1:40 you finish. If it’s 1:20 you have 20 seconds rest, if it’s 1:38, you have 2 secs rest.

Another example:

- FR 12 x ( 4 x 25 on :25) @ 2:00

This is more complicated &amp; means: ” Do front crawl, four 25m lengths, each length starting at 25 seconds. Rest after the forth until 2 minutes are up. Repeat each set of 4, 12 times. Giving a total of 48 lengths, 1200 metres.

Sometimes the time is not specified, only the RI. 

* BK 15x50m 5 RI, 

means backstroke, do 50 metres, 15 times, with a 5 second rest. 

(BTW, on a 5 second rest you will spend 2 seconds stopping and starting, looking at the clock.) 

*All of the above means that you can put a lot of information into a small amount of space like a pool whiteboard or onto a laminate.*",,False,self,t5_2r0po,True,,,True,t3_elk0n,http://www.reddit.com/r/Swimming/comments/elk0n/swimming_notation_understanding_a_swim_training/,

Are there equivalents in swimming? I mean, I have personal goals like swimming 1.5k in 7 weeks. I'm talking about events I can participate in without being a professional and without needing to have a great time, basically where just finishing is a victory!

But I am a year round club swimmer (Actually 10 months out of 12, I take an off season) but anyways we have a coach who is absolutely fantastic!  He has helped me drop over 2 minutes in my 500 (Went from a 7:38 in 8th grade to a 5:35 in 9th grade) and drop 40ish seconds in my 200 (1:59 as a 9th grader) but now this coach is leaving!  He was in the process of taking over our swim club and making it coach owned, but all of a sudden him and the other co-owner of this club are leaving to go to another club because they were offered more money.  Needless to say I feel pretty betrayed, even though I understand he is only doing what's best for him and his family.  So I have some questions I want to hear your advice on.

1st, should I follow this coach to the new club even though all my friends and team mates are in the old club?  There are still some pretty good coaches in my current club

2nd, Have any of you ever faced this problem and what did you do?

TL;DR Good coaches are leaving and I don't know what to do

UPDATE:  Thank you for all the advice on what to do, the most common answer was stay were you'll have competition.  (Like other kids to swim against) So I'm leaning towards staying with my current club.

I kinda put swimming on the back burner my first semester, then started getting into it more during the second semester. My new USA coach has some really good credentials and has coached Olympians and World record holders. 

So the 200 breast Trials cut for 2016 isn't out yet, but there have been some predictions that it will be around a 2:18 LCM. This is about a 1:59 in short course yards. Since I train mainly SCY, I was going to focus on breaking 2 minutes. I have a LONG way to go still. I just got my first sectionals cut (2:19), but I achieved this with only 4-5 practices a week. 

I have seen great improvements this year, and I know I can be training a lot harder. I have to cut about 19 seconds from my short course time in 3 years. I believe with my new coach and a new dedication, I can do this. Obviously I will have to start practicing 8-10 times a week plus dryland, but over 3 years I could see some significant time drops.

What I am asking of reddit is to help me out with some breaststroke workouts. Anything that can help my 200 or 100 breast will be appreciated, along with scy or lcm workouts. Here are 4 of my scy times that should give you a good idea where my endurance lies and what shape I am in:

200 free 1:54.9

200 IM 2:10.8

Ever since I joined this subreddit about 3-4 months ago, I have received helpful advice from experienced athletes. You all have helped me progress as a swimmer and I appreciate it immensely. I  was so ecstatic with my meet earlier today that I decided to post the following as inspiration for struggling swimmers.

Ever since I was a child, I had a knack for sticking with things, but was never really talented. I competed in several team sports such as Baseball, Basketball, and Football. I was always that dude that gave his all but never really progressed to the point of true success. Don't get me wrong, I loved sports, but I never really succeeded. Last Spring, I decided to pick up the sport of swimming. I had no idea what to expect- I still remember swimming (by myself, at a local YMCA) 5x25's on 1 minute. I hovered around 30 seconds. I then joined a club team, nervous, as any 13 year old would be about the coming practices. Wow. The initial experience of swimming was brutal for me. I went from going 5x25's on 1 minutes to 15x100's on 1:45. 13 year old me, coming off a broken arm and 3 months of no exercise, felt like quitting. I needed the exercise so I decided to stick with it. I swam throughout the summer and progressed pretty well. I joined my High School swim team and went from one 2 hour workout to two 2 hour workouts overnight. Again, now 14 year old me, felt like quitting. Somehow (I still don't even know why) I decided to stick with the sport. Around 4-5 weeks ago I decided to possibly pursue swimming as a career and or lifestyle. In a matter of 4-5 weeks, I went from going a 1:02 on my 100 Freestyle to a 57 (that isn't even my real time, its the first 100 split of my 200 Free!). I hope everyone takes this as inspiration and reasoning behind why we do what we do. Don't get me wrong, I am not amazing athlete, but through perseverance I hope to be. Good luck, stay strong swimmers!

Boland and Ehrman basically held serve from prelims, while Bundas lost a bit of the time Whitener had turned in on the fly leg in prelims. Whitener, however, blitzed the anchor leg with a stellar freestyle split en route to the record.

How can I be positive I am doing the technique right?

What muscles should I work out in the gym with what exercises?
Is there a large community here, or another subreddit of TI?
I am pretty short, and have small feet and hands, how much does this hurt?
How often should i swim to see some height change? I heard you grow taller.
I don't know if veterans can help here. But it seems like it takes a lot of force to get me going for one stroke, or arm and leg kick. It looks so effortless when I watch videos.

Gather your team and sit on a bench facing the pool, bleachers work fine.

There are three dice, one that determines distance, one stroke, and another that determines reps. 

Die 1:

1= 25

2= 50

3= 75

4= 200

5= 500

6= 1000

Die 2:

1= freestyle

2= breaststroke

3= backstroke

4= butterfly

5= I.M.

6= Choice

There are a couple catches though:

* Snake eyes (1 and 1) is automatic 6x1000, stroke of choice
* Since you're rolling towards the pool, if a die falls in, it is the automatic max that that die determined (butterfly for stoke, 1000 for distance, 6 for reps).

Ive gotten lucky and only had to do 3x25 and 4x75 for the past two years, and then got to leave. This is a lot of fun, and definitely a bonding activity for your team, try it!

I have plenty I can talk about but I'll welcome suggestions/questions for subjects.

Anyway, I'll start with some very basic stuff this week.

For Open Water you need some things you will not have for the pool;

* Silicon swim hat (better than latex). I recommend ALWAYS wearing a hat, regardless of temperature. Make it bright coloured (yellow or orange or bright red) for SAFETY so you are visible in the water, especially to marine craft.

* Good goggles. Bigger goggles with rubber gaskets are preferable for open water. Swedish googles aren't really suitable. Googles should be able to stay sealed in choppy water and be comfortable for long durations. Aquasphere or Blue Seventy make great Open Water goggles. I use Aquasphere [Kaimans](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_sc_2_18?url=search-alias%3Dsporting&amp;field-keywords=aqua+sphere+kaiman&amp;x=0&amp;y=0&amp;sprefix=aqua+sphere+kaiman) exclusively. I have worn them without discomfort for almost 20 hours. Generally you need to be able to adjust the goggles while wearing them.

* You need TWO pairs of goggles, clear and dark. Reflected sunlight off the surface can be severe and damaging.

* Anti-chaffing lubricant. Salt from sea-water acculatates on skin contact surfaces and can lead to severe chaffing, resulting in complete skin abrasion ( &amp; significant pain &amp; long recovery in the worst case) in a short time. Some people can be affected within 15 minutes of sea-water (me). Some can comfortably last up to an hour without lubricant. The messier lubricants should be applied using gloves or a plastic bag, or make sure you have something to wipe off your hands before touching anything.
  
  * Petroleum jelly. (Vaseline). Easy to apply in any weather. Lasts comfortably up to 2 or 3 hours. Messy. Don't get it on your goggles. Higher cost.

  * Body Glide (or similar), a silicon-based stick lubricant, often used by tri-atheletes. Easy to apply. Non-messy. Only lasts up to about an hour or an hour and a half. Higher cost.

  * Aluminium-based deodorant. Stick form, can be used for shorter swims. Non-messy, easy to apply. Medium cost.

  * Lanolin. Pure grease which results from washing sheep wool for dying. Cheap. Most long-lasting. Difficult to apply when cold. Turns white on contact with water or sweat. Will ruin goggles if it gets on them.

  * Channel Grease, favourite of marathon swimmers. Unfortunately only available for sale in Dover, UK, however... it's easy to make your own. 50% petroleum jelly/50% lanolin. Easier to apply than pure lanolin, lasts as long. Just as messy. Also changes colour on contact with moisture. Keep away from goggles also.

  * Duck/goose fat/butter/olive oil etc. Go ahead. Tasty. NONE of these will keep you warm.
 
* Ear-plugs. Reduce possible ear infections from Open Water and the possibility of Exotasis, (Swimmer's Ear). A really painful condition resulting from regular cold exposure. I prefer simple silicon plugs, other prefer pre-shaped plastic or custom plugs.

* Sandals. Cold numbs feet. Numb feet can get lacerated very badly.

* Post swim clothes. 

  * Carry a old t-shirt for first layer as you will not get all the grease off until you have a shower.

  * Multiple lighter layers are the best way to rewarm. Hat &amp; gloves.

* Wet wipes or a damp cloth to wipe off grease. dishwashing liquid works best.

* Suntan lotion. Open water swimmer's tans tend to be deep and, well, odd (white eyes and forehead and chest). Sun is especially strong from reflections on water, even on dull days). (This is optional in Ireland!)

* Drink/food. Dehydration is more likely in OW where you can't drink regularly. Rewarming after cold water consumes far more calories than the pool. Be prepared.

~~* Optional: Vinegar. For jellyfish stings.~~ Vinegar (or urine) do not work for almost all jellyfish stings.

* Optional: Piece of carpet or rubber mat to change on.

* A swim box or leakproof bag to carry all this stuff in and to keep your clothes dry while swimming.

* Optional: Wetsuit. Some OW swimmers frown on them, triathletes usually have to use them. Either way is good.

Edit: * A watch. (Thanks broken_hand). While for a few this is optional, most OW swimmers rely on one for timing, and exposure times.

[This](http://ruthkazez.com/swimming/ZeroTo1mile.html) program is linked over in the FAQ so I thought I'd give my thoughts on how it worked for me.


some background:

In September I joined a gym, bought a Total Immersion DVD and started learning how to swim from pretty much zero...I've always sucked at swimming...lots of thrashing and kicking that left me gasping for breath after 25 yards. 


By the end of November I had worked up to swimming 200 yards but was still struggling with breathing even though my stroke was  coming together nicely(practicing 5-6 times per week).



I started the [ZeroTo1Mile](http://ruthkazez.com/swimming/ZeroTo1mile.html) program on November 27th; a little apprehensive but hopeful that my breathing would right itself as the laps increased.  I did the program lessons on Mon-Wed-Fri while continuing to work on TI drills on Tues-Thur-Sat.

Looking back, I think I started this program at the perfect time--the first 2 weeks were tough but didn't leave me feeling destroyed.  During week 3 my breathing finally clicked (needed to exhale steadily and more forcefully) and I was finally able to relax and enjoy every lap.  

I [finished the program](http://imgur.com/kxZNj) today, Jan 7th, swimming 35 laps/1750 yards in 37 minutes.  I still have a lot of work to do improving my stroke but I'm a lot more confident in the water and looking forward to increasing my turnover and getting my speed up.

So that's it--a great program that was fun, challenging and got me to 1 mile in 6 weeks!

I'm an 18 year old boy, 6""4' (194cm) and 255 pounds (115kg).
I swam competitively between the ages of 7 and 15, but I got sick of the sport after many years in it, and due to my size, moved to water polo. I've always been relatively big, when I was 15, I weighed between 93-97kgs. Since then, I've obviously grown a bit, and unfortunately put on a lot of weight. I'm unhappy with the way I look (I know this isn't /r/weightloss or anything) so I'm motivated to come back into the sport. When I swam, I did 200 butterfly and 400IM as my main events. When I was 14, I swam a 2.14 for 200 butterfly, and my parents doubt that I could ever do a time like that again. To try and prove them wrong, I said that I think if I trained, I could swim below 2.20 with 2 months training. I am no where near as fit as I was when I trained, but I'm not completely unfit due to water polo.
I started the 63 days of training today, with a 2km set, building up:

Warm Up:  
400 (50free/50back)  
2 x 100IM's on 1.45  
Main sets:  
4x50 fly (on 1.15, holding 30-32)  
4x200 free (on 3m, holding 2.45)  
Warm down:  
200 (25free/25back).  

I could continue doing this and building up until I am able to do 200 fly again, and then drop times. Does anyone have any advice for this?

Sorry for the wall of text. Also, please don't comment telling me how unrealistic this goal is. I wish to do this, and even if I don't achieve the goal, will be happy with any training I've done.

If you need any more information on my goals or about me, I am happy to provide. Any advice on sets is appreciated :)",,False,self,t5_2r0po,False,,,True,t3_1bsefs,http://www.reddit.com/r/Swimming/comments/1bsefs/can_anyone_give_me_some_set_help_advice_long/,

I am planning to do the swimming leg of a spring triathlon relay on June 23...so, I have 11 weeks.

I am not an ultra-beginner swimmer. I haven't swam competitively since high school (I am in my second year of graduate school now), but I could do a 500 without stopping (I don't have an estimate for time right now though...). However, I am not currently swimming on a regular basis.

I've never done open-water swimming before, and I have never competed in an event longer than the 500 (which was in high school).

I am feeling really overwhelmed with all the information/training plans out there, and I'm hoping you all can help me make sense of them!

I'm planning to attend a couple of open water swim clinics, one on May 25, which involves 200 meter loop, and another on June 15, which involves a 300 meter loop. (These aren't in the lake where the triathlon will take place, but they were the best I could do.)

I also have the option of joining a Masters swim team (where I hope to get most of my instruction on technique), which has three one-hour practices a week, but that doesn't start until next month (May 8, to be precise).

What advice do you all have in planning my 11 weeks of training? (Especially the next month or so when I don't have access to an organized swim program.) How can I get the most out of these 11 weeks in terms of my performance on race day?

Is there any recommendations for dealing with currents? 

Obv, there's the common sense stuff. For example if its too strong give it a skip that day, don't swim when the river is flooded, stay where you're comfy and don't go alone. But is there anything that isn't too obvious?

Looking for something that didn't have as much impact on my shins while I recovered, I decided to try laps for the first time.

I had ""swimming"" lessons as a kid and thought I knew how to swim, but to my surprise when I got in the pool I couldn't really get -anywhere-.  I got into this subreddit to find some kind of program to ease into it and found the 0 to 1500.

To add to my frustration I could not even get CLOSE to finishing the exercises that everyone seemed to be claiming were an easy Week 1.  I came here in fits of frustration after each go at it, and each time I found someone voicing almost my exact frustrations.  Trouble breathing, trouble staying calm, not feeling like kicking was taking me anywhere, grandpa's lapping me (I actually got on here JUST to post this once and then found the exact post on that same day).  I didn't understand how I was so freaking bad.

I just kept at it though, and would try to focus on one thing at a time.  My first big step, which took about 2 weeks at 3 swims a week, was just getting comfortable being the water.  My second big step was to finally stop TRYING to go forward so much and just relaxing and keeping a steady pace.  Then as I began to break it down I got a rhythm to my breathing, then my kicking, then my strokes, and then it all just started falling together.  Now I'm at the point where I can keep doing all of it without really thinking, and then singling out something to work on.   I finally got all the way through the week 1 exercises with some gas to spare, and I'm ecstatic to continue.  Umm.. I guess it's time for a TL;DR, so..

**TL;DR** - Swimming is really really hard if you're just getting into it.  Don't get frustrated, just keep getting in the water.  It really does seem to all come together, and I'm gonna celebrate the small victories because it was hard as hell for me.  ;]  Thanks /r/swimming for all the tips and being so good to us new swimmers!",,False,self,t5_2r0po,False,,,True,t3_181jrt,http://www.reddit.com/r/Swimming/comments/181jrt/0_to_1500_stuck_for_a_month_on_week_1/,

Needless to say, I'm a bit nervous, so any tips or motivation you can share with someone who would like to actually snorkel without a gigantic life vest the next time she's on a vacation would be greatly appreciated

Thank you in advance!

UPDATE: Thank you everyone for your advice! Above all, I want to emphasize my thanks to those who emphasized breath control/blowing bubbles. Without actually holding my nose, that's always been an issue for me, but after that first time going under, just sitting on the bottom of the pool, remembering to keep calm and control blowing out through my nose slooowly helped. The class was registered as full, but it seems to be just me and two older ladies, one who is extremely afraid of water. 

Previously, I've only taken a couple one-time classes here and there as an adult; the first time, I woke up the next morning with a long lasting flu (no connection to swimming) and didn't go back, and the last time I tried to learn, the instructor tried to teach me to scull (that was a no go) then jumped right into trying to get me to learn a freestyle. When I had issues breathing, the only advice he had was to get a pair of nose clips. Yesterday, we learned some breath control and floating front/back (thankfully, floating is something that I've been able to do), so this slower pace is making me feel a bit more confident about what I'm learning before trying to tack on one more thing to think about and coordinate my body to do.

So at the beginning of my second year as a high school swimmer,  our team was running low on IM swimmers, so my coach forced me to swim it. Not surprisingly, I barely survived the slaughter, and for some reason I was put in a varsity heat, being dead last by about 30 seconds. I hated it, yet I loved it. 200 IM is in my opinion, one of that harder events in high school swimming because you have to proficient in all the strokes and have the endurance for all 200 yards. Something about it makes me feel elite about, I don't know why. However, the amount of stress that it puts on me is enormous, even to the point that my quality of life deteriorates. Even just 3 days before a meet, I get agitated, I don't study, I always get scared that I'll mess up, and when I'm up on the blocks, I literally feel like my heart will burst out of my chest.

So the question is, should I keep on swimming the 200 IM? Because I love the glory of it and I've always wanted to be an IM swimmer, but I hate the feelings of fear and apprehension that come before it and I want to focus on 100 Breaststroke (my better event) and my 50 free (so i can qualify for state with the relay team).",,False,self,t5_2r0po,False,,,True,t3_twg3h,http://www.reddit.com/r/Swimming/comments/twg3h/should_i_keep_on_swimming_the_200_im/,

1329910173.0,13,self.Swimming,q0sib,Open Water Wednesday - Feeding,18,5,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/Swimming/comments/q0sib/open_water_wednesday_feeding/,"Feeding is not diet or general nutrition, but the process of taking in nutrition/food for energy during a long swim. It's a long and complex subject which entertains and causes endless discussion amongst marathon swimmers.

The most important thing is: It's different for everyone.

Remember the marathon swimming motto: **Practice everything**.

But there are some guidelines.

* First, when do you have to feed?

You can generally assume that that you have enough glycogen in your body to last from two to three hours. (Contingent on not having depleted it in training or recent exercise).

So for a swim or race under two hours, you probably don't need to feed.

Swims where feeding is necessary dictate practice and experience. 

FINA marathoners will probably feed small amount every 10 minutes. This technique was pioneered by Peggy Dean and the US team in the 80s. The rest of us tend to feed from 15 minutes to 45 minutes. (I feed at thirty minutes). This MUST be tested, everyone's requirements  are different.

* Second - what do you feed on?

For most swimmers, the primary fuel is maltodextrin, pure carbs. (Not however glucose). The product name isn't important though **Maxim** is by far the most popular for distance swimmers as it has no taste and can be added to any food or drink. It's a 100% maltodextrin. **High5** or similar are carbs with a protein mix in a 4:1 ration, scientifically shown to be more effective but has proven to be a problem for many swimmers (e.g. me) in distance sea swimming for a few reasons: (salt intake, prone position, soya protein metabolization).

Again, there are many exceptions. Many swimmers have no problem with a 4:1 mix. Some swimmers forego these methods and swim on *solid* food (Penny Palfrey used dilute porridge).

* How do you feed?

This again is to the swimmer's preference. Feed (dolly) poles which hand a cup or bottle to the swimmer. Or a bottle dropped on a rope. The commonality is feeding is mostly liquid. If using a pole the swimmer must not touch the  pole itself. I've also seen fishing poles used. 

* Anything else?

Containers: Experienced swimmers will often only use a container or bottle with particular features. This is not minor as using a wrong bottle type for a swimmer can lead to salt water or air ingestion, both significant is you are swimming for more than 6 or 8 hours. You must consider the water temperature: Should the food be warm or cold?

Will you need/use electrolytes? If so how will you schedule them into the feed plan? Do you have a feed plan so anyone on the crew can take it over at any point? Do you want to schedule any other *treats* ? Duration: Do you have enough if you swim runs over? Do not assume that knowledge of feeding in other endurance events will transfer to sea-swimming, (it most likely will not).

This touches on the subject but is not a complete treatment, but might be useful for someone planning a first long swim.",,False,self,t5_2r0po,False,,,True,t3_q0sib,http://www.reddit.com/r/Swimming/comments/q0sib/open_water_wednesday_feeding/,

Hey!

I learned to swim a couple of years ago in my thirties, and I love it, and swim most days.  I make little tweaks myself but after taking the regular ""learn to swim"" class at the park district, the only other options for classes for adults are:
1. join a masters swim team where the requirements for entry are the ability to swim some large amount of m without stopping
2. join a class for triathletes who hate swimming and just want to be really fast

I don't know how to flip turn, I haven't learned anything but freestyle and backstroke.  But I don't know how to get this knowledge other than get individual coaching.  I have taken several classes that seemed in between but were actually people learning to swim (at the ""frightened of water stage"") or triathlete classes.  I am not by any means an athlete, so triathlete classes just make me feel like a gym class reject and don't really accomplish the goals I would like (learn all the strokes, see what's wrong with my form, flip turns).  

At this point I feel like a fraudulent swimmer because I don't know any of this stuff!

I feel like I am in the adult swim ghetto--by myself I can't get up to the number of meters I need to be in a team situation (and I don't really WANT to be on a team anyway), but I am too advanced to go to introductory classes (not bragging--I can swim and most of these classes are for people who can't).  People I talk to around the pool seem to be in the same boat and usually they compliment me on my swimming, and I think I'm the worst!  It seems like there's an audience for this.  Seeing as there's like 20 levels for kids, why can't adults get three?

I've considered the TI weekends, but they also seem like they are for people who can swim lots of pool lengths in a row without stopping.  I can swim maybe MAYBE 2 in a row.  I'm also an asthmatic so maybe that has something to do with that?

I'm looking for drills that will help her maintain a level plane in the water and then move on to rotation/breathing techniques. Right now I have her doing head-lead flutter kick drills, but she's having trouble keeping her legs up and her head down. Any tips/drills on how I can help her improve?

First I want to start off by saying I’m still young, a sophomore in high school, 15 ½ to be precise.   I started swimming competitively when I was nine, to my parents’ wishes.  I started with one of my friends, with other friends who had already swam some.  My friend quit quickly, within a single season, but I stuck it out.  Let me say, I was no good.  I quickly realized that I could not swim butterfly or breaststroke.   Also, I was nowhere close to being the skinniest kid on the swim team; I had yet to work off my baby fat, and was starting to add a little to it. When I was ten, at silver state (that’s what we call the meet right before state) I swam the exact state cut for 50 back.  I didn’t go to state for an individual, but I did go for a relay, the 200 medley, and we got second.  Soon, I wanted to quit.  But then I made the state cut in the long course 200 backstroke, I was reenergized, but not enough, I was still fed up with the sport.  My mother convinced me to keep swimming for another season.  To my surprise I gained five state cuts, and swam the 1000 as a bonus event.  That was when I discovered my calling as a distance swimmer.  I started swimming the 500, the 1000 and the mile, and started getting good at it.  Comparatively good, I was still no rock star.  But I slowly started seeing the relationship between putting in hard work in practice, and the times in my races.  So I started putting in hard work, and realized that at one point I might actually be able to be good at this.  Before long I get second in the mile at state.  Along with blasting multiple state records in relays.  So I end my story for now, by saying this.  Yesterday at sectionals, I swam my 200 freestyle with a 1:44.19, second in the sectional, seeded third in the state.  Then my 500 freestyle in a 4:47.11, third in the sectional, seeded fifth in the state.  My two relays, the 200 and 400 free are both in the top 16.  I just wanted to share my story with a couple of strangers, who have opened my eyes a little bit to the amazing sport of swimming.

TL:DR: I used to be chubby and slow, wanted to quit, didn’t quit, and started working hard.  Now seeded third and fifth in the state for the 200 and 500 free respectively, along with two top 16 relays.

About ten years ago, my school split into East and West. I swim for West, and we had a 9 year undefeated streak going for the boys in the pool. Going into the last relay, the 400 free, we knew that it the meet was at a dead tie and whoever won this relay would win the meet. I was the lead off leg, and since we are a fairly close team we all knew each other on the different relays. During the girls relay, who had been crushing East the entire meet, we were all so unbelievably psyched. My heartrate was easily 150 just thinking about the event. I saw who was leading off the East relay, and damn this kid was fast. I knew it would take everything I had to even stay near him. Getting on the block, i felt the entire title on my shoulders. The natatorium was raving, screaming; it was louder than I had ever heard it before. I looked and saw my entire team (other than the other 11 guys in the relays) screaming for us. It was us. It sounds mean/unsportsmanlike, but the other relays didn't matter. It was all about first. Every single person on that deck wanted us to touch first. I dove in with a solid start, but he began to inch away. On the turn, I caught back up a bit, and it was back and forth a little bit with him always just a bit ahead. On the last lap i was at his hip (The kid is still 6'5 and I'm only 5'9 so there was a lot of time between his hip and his hands) I buried my head and only breathed twice the whole last lap. I was seeing purple, blue, and even thought i may faint. Anyway, he touched the wall first with something like 48.7 (crazy, a new best time for him) and i looked up and saw 50.3 for me (damn near close a best time). We all knew he was by far the fastest person on that relay and he was the only person that was under 50. In the end, both our anchors dived (dove?) in and ours just couldn't overtake him, as he had started at 1.5 seconds behind. So in the end, we lost the relay, lost the meet, and our streak against our rivals was over. But it was also the fastest meet our schools have ever had, and by far the most competitive. All the guys on our relay grew as swimmers from that experience and I know we're all ready to come back next year even more tenaciously and take back our title. That race will both haunt me, but also motivate me everyday for the next year until we get another shot at their team. 
EDIT: forgot to add the bit about the environment of the meet.

The crawl is the fastest and most efficient, the backstroke makes breathing the easiest and can be a more leisurely stroke when tired, breastroke gives good front vision and better for some with bad shoulders. 

Butterfly on the other hand has high energy expenditure, yet still slower and less efficient than crawl, is toughest on the shoulder, hardest to learn, not great for any kind of vision angle, never a goto for a 'recovery' stroke, etc. The only redeeming value of the stroke I can think of is that you need to learn it to win butterfly swim events; ie it exists because competitions for it exist. 

I'm asking purely out of curiosity if there's some aspect I'm not appreciating about it, not bashing the butterfly swimmers out there. I'm not a racer (but I train for tri) but I'd like to learn it eventually just for the heck of it, but I always say to myself it'd be more useful to spend more time constantly improving my other three since I don't see any point of this stroke. Is there any other reason to learn it other than 'just for the heck of it'?

I dont have any formal swim training and never used to swim, my mom gives me pointers every now and then though. So swimming last night presented me with a few questions and problems.

1) my calves were burning! it felt like bees were stinging them and they have never hurt this bad. help?

2)If i put my face in the water and try swimming, i breathe in automatically, and if i try not to as hard as i can, my nose naturally burns. Advice?

3) I seem to have to put 10x the work load on my legs than on my upper body to avoid sinking, how do i evenly distribute this?

4) If I dont put near maximum effort i start sinking :( maybe because I am overweight, but I would like to fix this please.

5) How can I swim non stop? After every 25-50 meteres, I have to stop, but I can run for 7 miles non stop so I dont think it is my cardiovascular ability.

6) I cant swim without keeping my chin above the water, erm...I think this is a problem, help?

For some time a group of us from around the world have been discussing global marathon swimming.

As you may know, marathon swimming is a tiny but still growing sport with an estimate of only 2000 active marathon swimmers globally and historical total of only about 10,000. We operate as a community. As a group, we wish to see marathon swimming continue to be celebrated and encouraged, and confusion with other types of swimming reduced (which intends no disrespect to those swimmers and swims). This has been an increasing area of concern for marathons swimmers who operate under rules in place since 1875 and Captain Webb's first English Channel crossing.

As a step toward fostering and supporting marathon swimming, we’re inviting you to view and hopefully join [**The Marathon Swimmers Forum**](http://www.marathonswimmers.org).

We had a “soft” launch last week with a small global invitation list in order to get some people involved before announcing the forum more widely and to test it and see if the idea was valid or potentially valuable, and the thirty-ish people signed up from the invitation list  includes both some very successful marathon swimmers and some Aspirants.

The CS&amp;PF Channel email group, Facebook and various Association’s websites and blogs and local email lists already play an important global role in communication, education and connection. 

Marathonswimmers.org is not intended to replace or compete with any of those, or any other medium, but is hoped to promote, help and add to our global community.

It is intended to be open, global and to also allow anonymity.

There is no cost and no commercial element. It’s a free forum that we hope will become integral to the global marathon swimming community, both beginners and experienced swimmers. 

We hope it will be useful for learning AND teaching, advice, sharing information and help, volunteering, making connections, encouragement, trackers, cheering, celebrations and congratulations, and whatever else you’re having yourself.

From beginner to the world’s most famous open water and marathon swimmers, all are welcome.

We dearly hope if this is your area of interest you will drop by and make it yours.

Here’s to a marathon swimming world.

2. What are some good drills for backstroke?

3. How can I videotape my stroke underwater? In case I want to submit footage later.

4. How far up and down should my chest, hips, knees, and feet go in fly kick? I have no idea what it's supposed to be doing.

5. What should I be doing with my arms and head during my start? I've just been throwing my arms back when I start, but I don't know what else I should do.

6. How much time could I cut by shaving my legs?

7. What exercises should I be doing in the workout room?

8. Most of my practice is done at the local YMCA's lap swim due to scheduling problems. I have about 50 minutes to practice. What should my workout look like?

1321739562.0,16,self.Swimming,miea8,Injury prevention: Shoulder workout,19,3,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/Swimming/comments/miea8/injury_prevention_shoulder_workout/,"EDIT: There's a copy of the post in the comments with tons more reference pics. (It was too long for the main post.)

I got some requests for a stretch-cord shoulder routine, so I decided to give it its own post. I'll try to break it up as much as possible but it's likely to be a lot of text.

**15 minute shoulder/rotator cuff strengthening set**

Materials: Two stretch cords, one pretty heavy for short movements, one that you can raise both ends of over your head with straight arms while standing in the middle. [I use a red cord and a purple cord from here](http://www.spri.com/ItemGroup.aspx?ItemGroupID=1&amp;CategoryID=24&amp;ItemGroupTypeID=1). I always did it with a stretch routine embedded so I've included that for you here as well. If your goal is injury prevention then stretching is just as important as strengthening.

*Stretches: 1 minute per stretch, if it's a lopsided stretch split 30 seconds and then switch sides/arms.*

* Pinky-lead. Standing, light cord, 12 reps. Hold the cord with your thumbs hooked around the handle. With your arms straight and about 45 degrees forwards (as opposed to straight forward like superman, or straight out like Jesus) raise your arms with the pinky side of your hand leading. If you're overextending your arm at the elbow you can keep a slight bend in the elbow, just make sure whatever bend you have remains constant throughout the movement. Raise arms until they're point up over your head. Lower slowly. At the bottom of the exercise don't let any slack come in to the cord, keep tension on the entire time. That goes for the whole set.

*Stretch: Arm across the front, back of shoulder pull.*

* Palm-lead. Standing, light cord, 12 reps.Hold the handle across your palm (like you would normally hold a handle) and rotate your hand until your palm/wrist is facing up/out. Raise your arms above your head slowly and lower slowly. Same 45 degree angle as the previous exercise. 

*Stretch: Arm behind the head, tricep.*

* Super-mans. Standing, light cord, 12 reps. Hold the handle in a full fist like previously, but this time lead with the backs of your hands and raise them straight out in front of you, until they're above your head and you look like superman. These are slightly more difficult than the previous two and if you have to you can cheat by bending backwards a little when raising and lowering. Don't turn it into a military press by bending your elbows, that defeats the point.

*Stretch: front of shoulder pull, pin arm against a wall and rotate away.*

* Pulses #1. Standing, bent 90 deg at the waist, heavy cord, 60 reps. For the next to exercises you'll want a short, heavy cord. I generally take the purple cord and wrap it around my fist a couple times to shorten it. You're standing on the middle of the cord, and bent as close to 90 with as close to a flat back as you can manage. Your arms should be straight and your hands should be next to your legs, about even with your knees. Backs of the hands point behind you. Keeping your arms straight and the backs of your hands pointing behind you/up at the sky raise your arms directly behind you, they should come up to almost even with your spine. These are pulses so keep them quick, full range of movement should only take about 1 second. When you get to 60 your arms should be burning a little.

*Stretch: low grip, interlock your fingers behind your back and raise your arms straight behind you. Try for horizontal, but engage enough muscle to initiate a stretch across the front of your shoulders where ever that is for you.*

* Pulses #2. Standing, bent 90 deg at the waist, heavy cord, 60 reps. Almost identical to Pulses #1, but this time instead of going back your arms are going out to your sides. You probably shouldn't be reaching parallel to the ground on this exercise, it has a slightly smaller range of movement than the last one. It's also less tricep focused and more shoulders only. Backs of the hands lead, straight arms, usual drill. One second pulses with as great a range of movement as you can maintain. On both this one and the last one you can do a 5-10 second hold in the extended position once you reach 60 if you're feeling competitive. 

*Stretch: high grip, grip one wrist in the opposite hand behind your back and bend at the waist while raising your arms behind you, you should hopefully be able to get your arms past vertical this way so that gravity is doing the work of stretching your shoulders, don't push to hard because it's easy to pull the front of your shoulder in this position*

* Outward rotator cuff #1.  Standing, heavy cord wrapped around your hips, 24 reps. Ok, listen carefully to this part; take your heavy cord, and bring it behind you, the middle of the cord should be right at the base of your coccyx, now bring the ends in front of you and wrap the cord all the way around your hips, now the cord should cross itself right at the front of your hips, grip the part of the cord that is just past where they cross, left side with your left hand, right side with you right hand, palms/wrists facing up, now put your elbows right up against your hipbones, your elbows should stay here stationary for the rest of the exercise. [Reference pic for where to hold the cord](http://i.imgur.com/xZGNw.jpg), [reference pic for the resting position of the exercise](http://i.imgur.com/kLM4c.jpg). Note that in the second picture the cord is under tension; like the rest of the set there is no resting position where you're not holding tension in the cord. Now for the exercise. This time you can actually bend (extend) your elbows, but make sure your upper arm is rotating outward around the shoulder. Rotate your fists to the outside until they're in line with each other and your body, you will almost certainly have to extend your arms to do this, but make sure you're not just doing a tricep press, you should rotate the hands out while keeping them raised as long as possible, only lowering them and extending the elbow when you're not flexible enough to keep going with your arms bent. Make sure you keep the cord around your hips and don't let it slide up around your gut.

*No stretch, no rest, go straight in to the next exercise.*

* Inward rotator cuff+Pulses #3. Standing, heavy cord wrapped around your hips, 6-8-8-6 reps. For the inward rotation just spin the cord 180 around your hips. The cross should be behind you now, and for my cord length/hip width I can now grab the cord right behind the handle. Wherever you grab, make sure when your elbows are against your hips there is tension on the cord. The first and last 6 reps are inward rotator cuff, you should keep your upper arms basically stationary and your elbows fixed, while your lower arms go from parallel to the ground and pointing straight in front of you to crossed against your belly, alternate which arm is on top when crossed. This is a strong movement and shouldn't tire you out. While the pulses should be hard to do right. After the first 6 rotators you should keep your grip on the cord where it is and hold your arms out to your sides [like this](http://i.imgur.com/1k2Sw.jpg). Keep your arms straight (no elbow bend) and the 8 pulses should be straight out to the side. Then 8 more pulses straight out to the front, this time you have to bend your elbows, go from elbows in at your hips to arms fully extended forward and down, keep your hands at roughly hip height. Then back to 6 more rotations just like the first 6.

*No stretch, no rest, go straight in to the next exercise.*

* Outward rotator cuff #2. Standing, heavy cord wrapped around your hips, 12 reps. This is almost the same exercise as outward rotator #1 except slower with 3 distinct points. You count it on a beat of 3 as well, ""out (same as #1), up (from the fully extended position bend your elbows and raise your hands up to hip height, wherever they are is fine as long as they're at hip height and still as far out as you can go), and in (release back to the ""rest"" position same as in #1)"". Count on about one second for each one of ""out"", ""up"", ""in"". 12 cycles of that. After the last to exercises this should be hard, if it isn't then slow the count or get a heavier cord.

*No stretch, no rest, go straight in to the next exercise.*

* Last exercise, He-mans. Standing, light cord, 12 reps. Form is (even more) important in this exercise. You start and finish in a ""he-man"" pose. Standing on the middle of your light cord your upper arms are parallel to the ground and straight out from your torso. Your lower arms and pointing straight up with your wrists above your elbows. [Like so \(shitty webcam angle\)](http://imgur.com/EO9ae). Ideally your elbows should occupy the exact same space the whole time, don't wobble up, down, or in. Your wrists move in an arc from directly above your elbows to directly in front of you elbows. It helps to do this one in front of a mirror or dark window so you can watch your upper arms and try to make sure they don't move (and also check out your guns). Slow lower, slow raise. 12 reps.

1311166831.0,15,self.Swimming,iurzr,Open Water Wednesday - Why swim OW?,16,1,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/Swimming/comments/iurzr/open_water_wednesday_why_swim_ow/,"broken_hand asked me: ""[...] if you could talk about why someone should do OW swims (vs pool). Is it for fun, just something different, or other?""

I have to love a question more interesting than ""how do you deal with boredom and cold?"".

I wrote a quick list of the things I could think of straight away. I'm sure there are more I'll think of later.

Camaraderie
--------------
First and foremost, and most open water swimmers know this, is the camaraderie. That sense of a shared bond amongst open water swimmers. It's completely normal to see people of all ages hanging around after a swim, sharing tea or hot chocolate, cakes and biscuits in all weather, at all times of day and year, talking shite, but mostly talking about weather, swimming and the sea. Barbeques in Sandycove at midnight after a swim. Getting a cup of tea and a biscuit when you've forgotten to bring any. Loaning someone grease, googles or a hat. Getting calls out of the blue from friends who are in the area wanting to go for a swim. Chatting with club members and random people asking what you are doing and ""are you all crazy""?

Sense of well-being &amp; exhilaration
-----------------------------------------
What brings an 85 year old man to the sea every day? A sense of well being from that 20 metre dip. Meeting the people he has been frinds and swimming with for 60 years. Regardless of scientific eveidence of the tangible and measureable beneficial health effects of cold water swimming, one thing is certainly true. Your skin gets cold. Within a few minutes after exiting the water, blood flow returns. That sudden blood flow back into the periphery creates a sense of physical exhileration. Do it all your life and the sensation doesn't lessen. No drug can match that. And with that exhileration is a longer lasting sense of well-being. 

Challenge
-----------

Open water, particularly the sea, is always a challenge. It is never completely predictable in the way that the lane is a pool is always predictable. In a pool the only thing that changes is yourself. The challenge may be getting in the water for 20 metres when you have a head cold. It may be worrying about jellyfish. Or the fact you know, you should always know, that you are not the boss in there. It's said that sometimes the greatest freedom comes from letting go. Open water challenges you to accept that you will never be greater than nature, regardless of how experienced you are. And it and you challenge youself when you enter the natural environment. You challenge yourself to become one with it, not to be an outsider there, but to become part of something larger, something greater. I  have to mention here that I am an atheist. But being an atheist doesn't preclude a sense of wonder. In fact being an atheist has always fuelled for me that sense of wonder in the world around me, since I seek to understand, rather than accept without questioning. And it is rarely greater than when around or in the sea.

Competition
-------------

And there's competition, should you require it, against others. Regardless of age, or ability. Open water caters for all classes and ages in a spectacularly fun way. Beginner and intermediate races are often easy to get into. And if you have a reputation or record, you find yourself getting invited to other events.

Constant Change
-------------------

The repetition of the pool is a problem from many open water swimmers. That sense of adventure is one side of our experience of constant change in open water, never really knowing which day will be tough, which day will reach into you and leave a deep memory of where you've swam and what you saw and experienced. 

Similar to the aspect of challenge is the fact that no two days are the same in open water. There is a non-linear aspect to open water, of the fact that even the slighest perturbation in today from yesterday means the swims for both days are unique, far more so than the pool. You will find, every time you are in the sea, some aspect of that day that was unique. And that will last all your life. You will remember swims from years ago, for no particular reason than maybe a  cormorant came down to check on you while you were swimming past Seal Rock. Maybe the currents have moved again. The light hit you in a different place or there was a sudden surge of cold or warm water where there's never been one before. The sea has almost reached out to you and if you allow yourself, you can take each and every one of these moments as as a gift.

Ego
----

The seas cares nothing for your ego. But sure you have an ego. We all do afterall, at the most fundamental psychological unconscious level.  Placid or non-competitive as we may be, arrogant or combative, within most of us is something that we define as us, to ourselves, that is our ego. The sea will take all egos and only damage who fail to recognise that their eog is not greater than the sea.

Natural world
---------------

At a very simple level, when you swim in open water, you are swimming in the natural environment. Pools are hard lines and lanes, rules and the people who love enforcing rules through power games.
No-one owns the sea. When you step into it, you are stepping into the natural environment that is part of everyone's heritage. We forget too easily the world around us, the world outside of rooms. And when you forget or no longer feel part of the environment, then you dissociate from it, and it's easier to feel that you have no direct relationship wih it, and more importantly it's easier to stop caring about it and to feel that your own personal actions have no effect on it. Every swim in the sea is adventure. What will the currents, winds and tides be doing? Will I see wildlife today? What direction will I swim? Every single time around Sandycove Island or out to the Metalman or down Clonea is different. Recently I swam through the largest bloom of jellyfish I've ever seen and that's saying something. It was truely astonishing. I had to stop and just float because of how extraordinary it was. No-one else ever in the world will swim through that bloom, see that sight. And I climed onto the rock, the first time I've done so. Was I the first person to ever swim out there and then climb onto it? The rock on the seaward side is completely covered in layers of tiny petrified winkle shells and is extremely difficult to walk on. There was partial sunshine and the water on the far side was very cold. Another little adventure. Tomorrow will be a different one. You can make your own adventures.

Flying
------

Leonardo Da Vinci said that swimming was the closest a person could ever come to flying. Despite all the technological advancements, that remains true. Develop a reasonable swimming facility and step into the water, and considering the added buoyancy of the sea, you feel weightless and three hundred and sixty degress of freedom. I don't just swim out to sea, I am also flying out there, seeing the land from my own altitude, but with a similar sense of being apart, alone and in my element.

Extension of swimming ""life""
--------------------------------

So many kids swim in pool clubs. Then come 16 or 17 and it's over for them. Or maybe they go to colloege and squeeze another few years out of it. I've seen how the competitive pool world works. Too many people trying to dominate kids and parents, coaches and assistants. Too much self centred ego. So much of the pool swimming world is distasteful to me. Open water swimmers swim for life, in both senses of the phrase. All the factors I mentioned contribute so much that it's not a burden to swim. There's an almost childish enjoyement to be taken from it. You don't have to swim five thousands metres every day in the sea to receive the same enjoyement. There is no law of conservation of fun. Do it. Have fun. Do it more. Have more fun.

Feeling alive
--------------

A bad day in is the sea is better than a good day in the pool. There is always an element of risk in the sea, regardless how experienced you are. You can minimize it, as It ry to do, by understanding as much as I can, but I also admit to occasionally needing to do something that is deeply scary and therefore stupid. Last week I swam diagonally out of the bay to sea, kilometres away from land. It was scary. I felt alive. Maybe swiming in neck deep water is all you require for this. Or worrying about cold, or jellyfish, or fish or rocks. Anything. Everything. They all make you feel alive out there. Never in the sea will you be in that dozy state possible so many other places.

Fear
-----

I hesitate at this one. Not all all OW swimmers like this, but I do. Therefore I do dangerous risky things. I'm not advocating this for you, but what I need for myself. ",,False,self,t5_2r0po,True,,,True,t3_iurzr,http://www.reddit.com/r/Swimming/comments/iurzr/open_water_wednesday_why_swim_ow/,

While I do most of my winter training in a pool I swim through the year in the North Atlantic, so my areas of expertise are Open Water, Cold and Marathon Swimming (Ultra-endurance).

In this reddit we have swimmers from all 3 US Swim Divisions, (at least I think there are three?), Coaches, Swim Teachers, a blazingly fast Aussie pool &amp; OW swimmer, tri-athletes, fitness swimmers, leisure swimmers, granny-strokers, bobbers, floaters, flailers &amp; sinkers. All are welcome.

I think a permanent FAQ some basic questions would be helpful:

1: Learning to swim advice

2: Swimming for fitness and/or weight reduction

3: Stroke/drill advice

4: Session/set advice and planning

**Athletes of note:**

**Paul Bucha-** All American Swimmer in 1962. In 1967, as Commander of an infantry unit, his company came into contact with a North Vietnamese Battalion. While pinned down by enemy forces, he rallied his troops to remain strong, all the while calling in helicopter fire and artillery fire, as close as 10m from his position, to win the battle. At one point, he stood exposed and used a flashlight, exposing his position, to direct fire to helicopters. For his valor, he was awarded the United States Medal of Honor. 

**Dennis Zilinski aka Diesel -** Captain of the 2003-04 West Point Team. In Iraq in 2005, his unit encountered an IED which took out his entire convoy. He took shrapnel to his thigh, but despite that, continued to fight on. Over the next hour, he laid down fire to protect his unit, called in air support, as well as aid other injured soldiers. Despite his efforts, he passed away before medicav got to his position. 

**My Best Moment:**

In the 2004 Patriot League Championships, we entered an entirely Freshman team to the 4x200 free relay against Navy, who had a 8 second lead. Our relay got off to a good start, but the third leg of Navy got out to a big lead. Our anchor, Efriam (who later went on to set the 200 free record at West Point) fought back hard and split a blistering 1:38, got us within tenths of Navy. Despite our loss, we set one of the hardest West Point records to break: 6:44

I wanted to take her to a doctor, to make sure there is no concussion or some other horrible thing, but she said she's fine and not to worry about it.

* smacked a dude straight on the nose - he was swimming in the wrong direction. there was no one in front of me when I pushed of the wall so I didn't bother to look in front.

* collided head to head with a dude from the lane right of the lane I was swimming in - the waterpolo guys removed the ropes while we were still swimming in preparation for their training, we both didn't notice and banged our heads.

* couple of other brushing of hands with people in the same lane.

I would file these incidents under ""accidents"", but it seems like I am in most of them. So obviously I should pay more attention to what's going on around me, sometimes I shut my eyes off (they are still open, I just don't look with them, if that makes any sense).

So, I'm a runner with a screwed up knee - chondromalacia patella, the doc said it was between level 1 and level 2. I stopped running, had a bunch of crap happen in my life so I didn't do any exercise and the quadriceps basically disappeared - and I hurt the knee again. For the past few months I've been going to the gym, trying to get the quadriceps back (it's getting there, slowly) and I decided to start swimming (because riding a stationary bike sucks). Since I didn't really know how to swim I started with an instructor (group of usually five - eight people, three times a week, for an hour in the pool).

So I am doing well, but since my physiotherapist warned me not to do breaststroke, and I read on *the internet* about it being hard on the knees, I am avoiding it. And honestly I don't care for it much.

Last time the instructor kept convincing me that the breast stroke is really not hard on the knees and I should just do it, that he had a hurt knee as well, and there was no impact in the water, and blah blah blah. So I got tired of standing still in the pool like an idiot, arguing with him, and I tried it for a length (twenty five meters). My technique is nonexistent, and I felt my knee hurting a bit. Afterwards he said: 'it hurts because you're kicking too hard, if you do it properly it won't hurt.'. Well duh, but I don't know how to do it right, and I really don't want to screw up my knee again just to learn the fucking breast stroke.

I don't think I'm being unreasonable, but I want to hear some advice from other more experienced people.

My swim times were 1:18:43 in the first one in 2008, and 1:15:53 in 2010. I'm planning on doing my next Ironman in 2014, and I want to try my hardest to do the swim in an hour, or as close to it as possible. That means I have 2 years to work on my technique, endurance, and strength.

First off, is this possible to reach on 3 swim workouts a week, considering that I need to train all 3 sports, and bike will have to be my focus. Second, how do I get there?

I recently forced myself to start bilateral breathing, but I'm only a bit over a month into that. I am also going to be training pretty strictly by heart rate and the Maffetone method for all 3 sports.

Tools currently at my disposal:

* Garmin 910XT
* Polar heart rate monitor (used only for swimming)

* Finis Freestyler hand paddles

* Flippers (Zoomers I think?)

* 25 yd pool

So, knowing my previous times, where should I start? I was building up distance (up to about 1 mile) with the bilateral breathing, and doing it at about 1:50/100yd, which is just slower than my previous Ironman pace. Trying to swim with the heart rate monitor, I wasn't able to get up to my aerobic threshhold before I was too wiped and had to take a rest, which was about 200 yards at 1:35/100yd pace. swimming at the 1:50/100 pace, I know that I can build up my distance pretty quickly. Hopefully this gives an idea of where I'm at right now.

Does anybody have any advice for me on drills, or how to approach this? In years past, I pretty much would just build up my distance leading up to the race, until I was doing about 4,000yd swims without rest. I want to do this correctly this time.

I figured /r/swimming would be the best place to post this seeing as that's my drug of choice for keeping fit.

For the past few months I've been pushing myself but not to my absolute limits swimming for 45ish minutes usually covering over a km to a mile. I do some weight training on the other two days of the week and rest on the weekends. I'm on a high protein, moderate carb diet and really feel great with what I'm eating. However, I want to perfect the results I've achieved so far a little further. I'm 5""10 and just over 154 pounds. I don't have too much body fat left but enough that there isn't really any great definition on my abs which is my next goal.

So what would be the best way to go about this? Should I cut my time and really push myself or should I keep going as is? Maybe do some crunches on the side as well?

I'm not even a distance swimmer. I'm a sprinter. I spent most of my time in the water bouncing off of a few walls at a time. That being said, today I tried out for California State Lifeguards. The tryout consists of a 1000 yard open water swim, followed by a 200yd by 400yd by 200yd run/swim/run.

This was my second attempt trying out. I went to a tryout at a different location 2 weeks ago, but due to a series of unfortunate circumstances (Not much sleep the night before, didn't have breakfast, was sick), I had an asthma attack during the run-swim-run segment, and was forced to pull out. The conditions then were light wind and 5-6 ft breakers with water temp around 60 degrees.

Today the conditions were much worse. The breakers were 10-12 ft, easily double-overhead, with 15mph winds and 52 degree water. I am proud to say that I passed the tryouts, coming in 6th on the 1000 with a time of 19:31 (a little too close for comfort to the cutoff, but I still made it), and 4th on the run (didn't get my time).

No, the bad thing I did was not actually swim since my conference meet last February. Under normal circumstances this would be lazy, shameful at worst. However, facing winter term training in about a month in my current condition is not lazy; it is suicide. 

I'm taking steps to amend this situation. I've joined the Abs by New Years thing in r/fitness and joined the local pool but the truth is I am still a lost sheep. I have no idea where to begin. I haven't been out of the water this long since grade school.

But it's all about the Search Box &amp; Sidebar for future reference. I have't had time to write more this week so this post will be divided into two parts.

Bi-lateral breathing:
----------------------

An important skill for open water is the ability to control your breathing. More so than pool where bi-lateral is nice, but doesn't offer too many advantages, the abilty to bi-laterally breathe in Open Water is much more significant.

 * Firstly bi-lateral breathing is more important for safety. The swimmer can obviously see more, Seeing more equals more awareness of hazards. Rocks, buoys, rope, boats. 
 * It's a great aid in bad weather. For example,if a wind is coming from your right, and you can only breathe to the right, well, welcome to throwing up due to swallowed water, or abandoning to due to swallowed or aspirated water.
 * Apart from the navigation aspects consonant with being able to see more, many swims are boat assisted. Kayaker's, much as we rely on them, are rarely aware of swimmer's requirements, (regardless of briefings), sometimes go on the swimmer's blind side. It's easier to not have a blind side. 
 * Breathing to one side causes blind spots in races. For example I like to swap to a swimmer's weaker side on a turn or approaching a finish. Lead them to believe you have dropped behind and then come around them. And there are other ways to take advantage of someone with limited breathing options ...

Other breathing skills;
------------------------
 * In rough water, breathing is difficult. One way to address this is to add more body roll when breathing, to look more skyward. This allows more time to breathe and moves the mouth further away from a rough water suface.
 * Another problem if you are considering longer distances in the sea, is the build-up of salt in the mouth and throat. After marathons swims it can take days to recover from a painful raw throat and difficulty in eating. This can be ameliorated somewhat by changing a standard pool breathing pattern in which exhalation is all or partly through the mouth, to controlled exhalation only through the nose.

Improving sighting:
----------------------

 * Sighting is a *vital* skill. 
 * Try to sight from the crest of waves, where applicable.
 * Separate breathing from sighting. 
 * Keep sighting as brief as possible.
 * Start with sighting every 6 or 8 strokes. As your skill and confidence grows you will be able to reduce the required amount. Sighting is hugely dependent on conditions. Flat water requires less, so long as you are able to maintain a reasonably straight line. Choppy water is far more difficult.
 * Try looking forward from as close to the surface as possible. EDIT: [see this pic of Olympic Medallist Keri-Ann Payne for a good example](http://www.imgur.com/5DppN).  Lifting your head to get a good look will drop your legs, and instantly slow you. If the water is rough and you lift too high, you will also suffer from impact which is very tiring and potentially damaging. A personal example; though I am a bi-lateral breather, I favour my right side. BUT, just after beathing on my left side, I find I have greater control on looking forward from a very low postion, with my eyes about 1 cm above the water, than if I try to do the same thing when moving my head from the right. So you will need to find you own optimum position. This can be practised in the pool.

I obviously want to keep my cardiovascular fitness up, and my weight down, and swimming is the most sensible way to do this in a low-impact way.  I've also toyed around with the idea of doing a tri, and since swimming would have been my weakest component, I'm looking at this as a good opportunity to build up that skill.

I'll start out by saying I don't know the first thing about swimming training, or really even proper technique.  Today, I can swim 2000m front crawl fairly comfortably in about 40 min.  I've been doing this twice a week to start out, but would like to jump into doing this five times per week.  I'm just not burning the calories that I need to burn right now.

As a runner, increasing weekly mileage 2.5x is certain to land you an overuse injury.  What about swimming?  If it feels comfortable, can I just do this?

1365700459.0,12,self.Swimming,1c59f3,I recently made a subreddit that I hope will include some swimming videos,15,3,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/Swimming/comments/1c59f3/i_recently_made_a_subreddit_that_i_hope_will/,"I'm subscribed to most of the major sports subs and some of my favorite content includes videos of really good plays and athletes doing amazing things. I think that could be true for a lot of you as well. The problem is, I always get stuck having to dig through a ton of different subs or visit a separate website whenever I just want to watch a bunch of sports videos.

So instead of having to search through all kinds of links in the different sports subs I subscribe to, I wanted to make a place that would group the best videos into one place and I could just go through and see a lot of incredible athletes doing what they do. This prompted me to create:

/r/athleticfeats

Basically I want to showcase the amazing things that humans are capable of. I'm looking for everything from monster dunks to free climbing. Anything that takes extreme physical talent above and beyond what you see normally watching sports. I would really like to incorporate swimming into this given the athleticism it takes. I also want to direct users to the specific sub for the sports that are shown. That way, users can learn more about sports they may not have known about or been interested in before watching them.

So my concept is essentially:

When you find a video of an athlete doing something badass, post it in my sub or cross post it with a relevant sub so that users can find a sport specific sub for the video. Hopefully this turns into something similar to Sportcenter ""Top 10"" but with a lot more content and from a more diverse selection of sports.

Feedback is appreciated so let me know what you all think.

I'm a newbie here. I messaged the MODs and they recommended submitting as a post so here's the meat:

I was a football,basketball, track guy all through high school. Now that I'm in college (21) I've gotten into running because I miss the competition. However lately I've been dying to get into the pool. I've always loved swimming as a summertime type activity and you couldn't get me out of the pool as a child. Now I see it as a great opportunity for working out and mixing in some cross training. 

I've come to you to help me get into the pool. My goal is just as fitness and exercise, I'm not looking to compete or become aquaman. I just want to swim some laps, and try out and learn some new strokes to help tone and cut my body a bit better.  I go the the University of Louisville and we have an excellent facility that I can use to my advantage. My main concerns:

Swimwear: all I'm familiar with are the swimming trunks you buy for summer and the beach. Not too fond of the speedo. I don't need competition level trunks or anything. Something just more geared towards lap swimming as opposed to aesthetically pleasing summer wear.

Also, any videos or links for maybe a few form pointers and tricks? That's how I will maximize my workout gains. I know it takes practice to learn, but I have minimal knowledge of different swim techniques.

Any and all help is appreciated! Thanks you guys!

My question though,  I was wondering if there was a competitive league or something for older people like me. Most of the threads i see are for relatively young people and when i try to google i just fail at finding anything that could help me out.  I currently live in Pittsburgh if  by anychance anyone knows anythign specific around here. if not any tips to finding out would help.  THANKS!

1337157446.0,13,self.Swimming,tpp1j,"Open Water Wednesday - Waves, and what to do about them",13,0,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/Swimming/comments/tpp1j/open_water_wednesday_waves_and_what_to_do_about/,"As we know, waves occur where an open ocean swell meets where the ocean bottom gets shallow, on beaches, reefs, and rocks. Waves are somewhat unpredictable even in good conditions and care must be taken of them. So entering the water in the presence of waves requires some degree of caution, dependent on wave size. Trying to exit on rocks or reefs, in even small waves, is fraught with danger.

So why do waves present such difficulty? It's simply because water is dense, denser than a human, and heavy and anything heavy has a lot of inertia. Difficult to start, divert or stop.

Everyone has probably stood on a beach in waist high waves and felt how easily the waves can push one around.  

Children learn to jump as the waves approaches to go over the top, or to jump into the wave and let it take them, or to stand with one foot and chest forward to try to hold their position. These are all approaches to the mass of the wave and all and more can be used by swimmers.

The video below perfectly illustrates the problems faced by swimmers unfamiliar with waves.

[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWH1agpu4M]

I hope you noticed the guy on the left at the start, who disappeared pretty quickly. He knew what to do. Instead of standing around like a scared duckling, trying to progress by hopping forward and getting pushed backward, he went under the waves.

Power within a wave is concentrated when it is breaking in the crashing top of the wave. Waves breaking into shallow water, even without being large, will travel fast and slow movement with a lot of lower density white water being pushed ahead.

The water in front of a wave is sucked up into the wave face, while the wave is moving forward so you may get a quick sensation of speed just before the wave hits. You can use this speed to your advantage to get under the wave. Just duck down and forward under the wave and then up and you will pop out well behind the wave lip and past most of the drag of the breaking water.

Remember that water being dumped on beaches by waves needs to escape back outward, so most beaches will have ""channels"" (some steep beaches will  instead have dangerous undertow).

The trough in front of a wave is lower than the average height, whereas the water behind a wave lip is higher. So if you plunge into a wave face and exit behind, you will be higher up, but if you come up just behind the lip of a crashing wave, you have to be careful not to get dragged back over the edge, ""going over the falls"", though is generally not a problem unless you are very close.


In [this image of a local shingle beach](http://imgur.com/hHScv), though the waves are only waist-high, one can see that the shingle isn't all the same height, some is banked. The areas between the banks are more likely to be deeper, and more likely to be channels as this trough extends outward. The difference will usually look somewhat subtle, but is pretty consistent. If you notice in the image, where the arrow starts, the sand extends further into the shingle as this is a lower trough and this recurs along the beach, so there is actually more than one channel, more visible the more water is trying to escape. However channels tend to exist closer to the beach and as you escape beyond the initial whitewater, the effect will dissipate.


* Don't panic. There is no situation made better by panic and most will be made worse, especially at sea.

* Don't try to get away from waves. You won't win. Face them and work with what they are doing.

* Look for channels, the narrow and usually deeper areas where waves aren't breaking, where the incoming water has to escape back out to sea. That's your easiest way out. But once in a Channel, don't try to swim back into land against it.

* In water where you can walk, angle your body sideways to oncoming whitewater, and brace yourself as you move outwards, moving out in the intervals between the wave fronts.

* Once you reach chest deep water, if you are over sand, it will have become harder to progress by walking even with no waves, so get swimming.

* The best approach when going out from a beach is to dive under the oncoming waves.

* Don't take a huge breath of air, it'll be harder to submerge. Instead hold the air into your lungs instead of trying to hold a mouthful. Popping under and behind a big wave is a pretty quick task.

* Don't try the same thing with waves breaking over rocks. Because idiocy.

* Swimming against a rip current is a poor decision. Change your angle by 45 to 90° and you will quickly move out of it.

* As you progress out pass the breaking waves, triangulate your position so you know where you started, might need to finish. Line up two objects (on land obviosuly), one of front of the other, a house and tree or similar, and you will be able to tell your position along a beach. Otherwise you can be 100 metres to either side and it will still look like the same place.

Waves interfere with swimmers by stopping them getting out deeper, by pushing them back into shore, by knocking them over, by pulling their legs from beneath them and by breaking over them. All these problems can be reduced or eliminated with experience and practice.

I am a 18 year old senior in High School (America so units will be yards) and I cant stay motivated to swim any more. I have swam since I was a wee little lad and my coaches have always been impressed by my ability to perform at all ages regardless of how hard I work. Literally everyone tells me I have natural talent in the sport, but I cant comment on that. 

I quit swimming for a year (age 13-14) and came back to a new coach at my local swim program. He was the best damn coach I have ever seen. He brought me from a 5:55 in my 500yard freestyle to the 4:48 I currently sit at. He brought me from a first time miler 18:42 to a 16:32 in a year. At my swim program there were 4 people in my age group, including me. One was my age and last year the 2 others (who were my best friends in swimming) graduated and the coach left with them. 

So I am gridlocked and cant find any motivation to even touch water. I have potential to swim at least swim in Division II NCAA but still, it sucks. It is now just me and the one other girl my age at practice now. Since my favorite coach quit 2 years ago, our yardage has dropped 3000 yards a practice down to 6000 yards and it sucks.

",14,1,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/Swimming/comments/nxxcv/tonight_is_the_hardest_workout_of_the_entire_year/,"Since Region is right around the corner, my coach makes the hardest workout of the year on New Year's Eve. Since I'm only a Freshman, this will be my first year going to it. People who have been swimming all four years say that it so hard, that they have cried while swimming. 

For those who are concerned, last years workout was: 
111 75's on the 1:15.
(Swimming 75 yards in one minute and fifteen seconds continually until you've done it 111 times)
But it changes every year. This is just an example of how extreme the workout is going to be.

So, my questions to you is: How do I prepare myself? (I ate a decent amout of carbs yesterday) How do I keep myself from stopping? Should I sprint in the beginning, or just stay a steady but fast time the whole way through? Should I stretch? Is there anything I should avoid doing before/during/after? 

TL;DR: My coach plans to torture us with an extreme workout tonight from 5-7 that most people don't make it the whole way through. How do I survive it?



UPDATE: It wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. You guys really helped! As I said, the workout changes every year and this year it ended up being 60 100's on the 1:52 with every fifth one the last length being swam Butterfly. Usually when we do workouts similar to this I finish on (give or take) the 1:20, so I was prepared to pace myself. I was put on the easiest group (the other ones being just regular 125's on the 1:52). Even then I was finishing before everyone in my group with atleast 10 seconds to spare. I kept making myself slow down to kind of keep in pace with the rest of the Freshman and usually finished around the 1:36 until about half way when I told myself to screw it and finished around the 1:32. I definitly was not going my hardest. When there was about 17 left, my coach told me to start making them under the 1:30 and that's exactly what I did. He walked up and down the lanes (I was in lane 1) with me telling me to keep my elbows up, make my entry deeper, my turnover faster, etc. Even though I knew I could have pushed myself faster, I still feel a sense of pride that I did every single one with time to spare. 

My twin sister who also swims stopped atleast 6 times and turned to me and said, ""How are you doing this?!"" So like one of you pointed out, my pride helped me along. Thanks for all the support!

To prevent this I seem to do the last stroke with extra power... it pulls me out of the water slightly and gives me a second more to breathe. But I worry that this is something that could cause shoulder problems later.

Also, one last question... this might seem a bit silly but what do you do with the leading arm when you breathe? When I breathe to my right and have my left arm in front of me for example, I never know what to do with it. Should I just leave it there while breathing (and until the rotation is done...) as if gliding in the water? Or should I start to pull it back? If so, in what angle?

1324301755.0,14,self.Swimming,nigt3,Open Water Wednesday: Planning a Christmas or New Year cold open water swim? Some advice.,17,3,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/Swimming/comments/nigt3/open_water_wednesday_planning_a_christmas_or_new/,"This is just a rehash of [last year's post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Swimming/comments/eop7t/advice_extensive_for_anyone_considering_a/) for those who remember.

It has plenty of detail but **the most important items are IN BOLD**.


With Christmas coming, many of you who would never consider getting in cold water will be thinking of a Christmas or New Year's Day dip.

A Christmas or New Year's Day swim is absolutely worth doing for the sense of well being afterwards. You do not have to come over to the Dark Side of swimming.



Cold is a skill, not a talent. It can be learned. But if your first cold swim is Christmas Day, you won't learn it on that day. And it is  dangerous and devious and a long-time friend of mine. So instead plan &amp; know what to expect.


**PLAN:**

* **Make sure you have**: **a swim cap** (silicone or neoprene preferably), **a towel**; goggles, **sandals** or slippers.

* If you only have latex cap, wear a few hats;  And plenty of warm clothes for afterwards. Including a hat and gloves. Warm clothes are many light layers rather than a few heavy ones. Most people won't wear a swimming cap. For a few minutes this is fine but it will hurt.

* Bring sandals or deck shoes.

* **Bring something to stand on while changing**. A spare towel, a piece of cardboard, a shopping bag.

* Put your swimsuit on before you leave home. You will spend less time getting cold before you swim. Don't forget your underwear! :-)

**OBSERVE:**

* If it's an irregular visit, **your most important pre-swim action to make sure you know where to exit the water safely**. Do not rely on the wisdom of crowds. Many of the people near you will know nothing. 

* Watch the water before you get it. Regardless of the amount of people in it, if the water is breaking or surging more than about 1 metre, on steps, rocks or a ladder, the exit will be difficult, dangerous or impossible.

* If you have been drinking alcohol the night before, don't do it. Alcohol seriously impairs the body's ability to deal with cold by reducing peripheral vaso-constriction and therefore dropping core temperature. The same applies if you haven't slept the night before.

* Forget grease. It does nothing for cold protection and you won't in long enough to worry about chafing. If you are swimming that long, you need none of my advice because you know what you are doing.

* Neoprene (wetsuit) gloves and booties will significantly reduce the discomfort if you are not used to it. There are no Channel rules in operation for Christmas Day swims.

**BEFORE THE SWIM:**

* Take the clothes on your lower body off first. Keep your torso &amp; body warm for longer.

* Change as close to the water as you safely can. You want to reduce the time exposed before and after swimming.

* Wear the sandals as close to the edge as you can. The ground will be colder than the sea. Cold = numb = lacerations = blood.

* **DO NOT STAND AROUND TALKING** once you are changed, get to the water.

* IT'S NORMAL TO BE NERVOUS because your body is adapted to avoid cold. Just be positive. Accept the increased heart rate. Tell yourself you are a swimming god.

* It's not a competition. Depending on your location there may be lots of people who don't know what they are doing in the water that day. 

* Stay clear and watch everything. Move carefully.

* **SPLASH WATER on your face before immersion**. This indicates to your body extreme cold is coming (by which I include temperatures of up to 14C/58F for those of you not used to it). It will allow your heart rate to settle quicker and make breathing easier.

* Just as you get in..tell yourself it's warm. Cold is partly about attitude. Tell yourself it's actually better than you thought. *Hell, it's almost warm. I was worried about this?*

* **DO NOT DIVE IN**. Just don't do it. I don't care how tough you think you are. Unless you are a very experienced cold water swimmer this is a dumb thing to do. It causes heart attacks and rock impacts. But don't stand there trying to get in either. Walk in to your waist. 

* Splash the water. Then off you go. No more than 1 minute getting immersed.

**DURING THE SWIM:**

* Without experience it is difficult to get your face into cold water. This is normal. Cold stimulates the gasp reflex through increased heart rate. It makes breathing difficult. This is also normal.

**STAY CALM.**

* Change your breathing pattern to head above water or breathing every stroke or 2nd stroke.

* Without experience expect your heart rate to take many minutes to settle.

* **DO NOT STOP IN THE WATER**

* **HAVE A GREAT TIME**. Feel like a hero. Do 10 metres. Or 20 or 50 or 500 metres. It probably won't kill you. Probably.

**EXIT:**

* Watch your exit. Be careful. It is at this point most lacerations occur on the feet, legs and hands.

* Get your sandals/slippers on and get to your clothes.

* The temperature WILL be below 10C, expect sharp pain in your face, hands and especially feet. Your skin will be tingling all over your body. You will go from pain to numbness. There is no in-between.

** AFTER THE SWIM:**

* **AFTER-DROP** is dangerous**. You have only about 8 minutes before its onset. After-drop is the body temperature dropping after you exit the water. It's not a problem if you are only in a couple of minutes though, unless it's less than 5C (40F).

* **DO NOT VIGOROUSLY TOWEL YOURSELF.** It will accelerate afterdrop.

* Dry the torso first. Dress the torso.

* Then put on a hat.

* Then the lower body.

* Then have your chat, your hot chocolate or soup.

I'm looking for technique pointers and whatnot. Sorry I can't provide a video of my form, I don't have that kind of equipment. 

I'm just wondering if I should get my bilateral breathing perfect before I try to develop my front crawl endurance. My mentor wants me to start swimming 100 meter repeats and 500 meter swims, etc to develop my endurance, but I don't want to develop my endurance breathing to only 1 side of my body (right side). Whether I do 3-5 stroke breathing or swim 1 length right side and 1 length left side breathing, the breathing on my left side is extremely clumsy and tires me out due to inefficiency.",,False,self,t5_2r0po,False,,,True,t3_m179k,http://www.reddit.com/r/Swimming/comments/m179k/how_did_the_more_experienced_swimmers_develop/,
