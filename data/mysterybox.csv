We are not a reborn /r/jailbait and these advances are not welcome regardless of where they occur. 

If these people aren't me, and in full disclosure we've not had a single report about this yet and **it is purely a pre-emptive announcement**, please message the mods so we can ban that person and create some sort of public shame list. I love the idea of everyone from eight to eighty trading because it's entertaining as hell regardless of your age/gender/location, and in that spirit I don't want people preying on the more vulnerable members.

So if you could please, if someone starts creeping on you, discontinue speaking with them and message the mods immediately. The other two mods are female if you'd feel more comfortable going that route, but if you could just PM me with their name, what they said, and maybe what you're wearing it would be a huge help in stopping these idiots before they drive off traders.

edit: Oh, and parents. If you're doing this with/for your kids, feel completely free and by all means you're totally encouraged to post, but do be safe about it. Our tools are not good, we cannot protect you or your children, and even if 99.999% of redditors are as normal as the people you trust to serve your food and teach your children, there's still that .001% who the police haven't picked up yet. I'll reiterate that **I've never seen any evidence of this shit happening in any capacity whatsoever in any exchange subreddit I run**, but it's still something to be mindful of.

Maybe as a warning to other first time traders, maybe to see how often this happens to anyone else, maybe it's just out of simple frustration.


A few months ago I posted that I was looking to make my first trade. After quickly receiving a couple responses, I got excited, began pooling my resources and got a few friends involved in putting the boxes together. In total, I sent three boxes...and received one. For the one I received, I'm grateful and have since thanked the sender several times through the course of talking with her. One of the boxes came from overseas and got lost somewhere in customs, which is understandable and the sender has been in regular contact as we try to sort out its loss. The remaining box was never sent, and the sender was in regular contact with me until I confirmed the box was sent. Since then, I've never heard another word from her. 


This exchange was something that I looked forward to, and put thought in to each item that I shipped. It was my understanding that the same type of package would be sent to me, and I could get a greater understanding of someone from another part of the country. In this particular case, I guess I got just that. But if people just wanted free shit, then they should just say they wanted free shit. Hell, I wouldn't mind sending some stuff. I feel cheated out of excitement and some other intangible emotion that comes with not knowing what to expect from a stranger. But in another way, this person proved exactly what to expect from an anonymous stranger. In this case, she stated she was a 20yr. old gamer girl from Indiana. 


Below is a list of the included items and the description included for the larger items.


-	1x Sim City 4, PC game
-	1x Seven DVD
-	1x Innova Sidewinder Distance Driver, Frisbee golf disc
-	1x The Art of Final Fantasy IX, book
-	1x Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, book
-	1x Pirate ducky rubber squeak toy
-	1x Bud Light table tent (picture frame)
-	1x No Hunting sign
-	1x Pewter dragon figurine
-	1x Tiny plastic trophy
-	1x Sharpie pen
-	1x Sharpie liquid pencil
-	2x Glow sticks


Sim City 4 - Enjoy! Hopefully you don’t have this already. I had an extra copy laying around. I believe it only has two discs.. If it ends up not being complete, let me know. 


Seven DVD - When I thought, “what’s a great movie that I’d be surprised if a 20yr. old female had seen”, this was one that came to mind. If you haven’t seen it, enjoy. It’s creepy. If you have seen it, I’m impressed!


Sidewinder - This is one of my retired discs. I know it’s not in the best condition, but that’s because this disc has served me well, and it’s seen a lot of play through the years. It’s a great disc, especially if you’re just starting out. Take care of it, and don’t hit too many trees with it! 


Final Fantasy IX Book - This has been in my collection for years. I thought a gamer girl would appreciate it. I know it’s obviously out of date, but it’s chocked full of great art.


Pewter Dragon Figurine - When I was younger, I used to collect pewter figurines. I don’t collect them anymore, and they’ve been in storage for a while. But while I was rummaging around, I found them and thought you would appreciate one as well.


There's no hard feelings here, I truly hope they enjoyed the received box. Based off the little information I had been supplied, I selected the items with her in mind. I've enjoyed checking an empty mailbox for the past weeks in the rare chance that it just got held up in the post, but after zero communication after repeated attempts, and nearly two months of waiting, I feel it's a lost cause. 


To the newbies, be careful who you choose to trade with. Not all mystery box swaps are as grand as the community would have you believe. To the freeloaders, just say you want free shit, don't get our hopes up in vain.

1331686664.0,36,self.mysterybox,qvfeq,Growing pains,39,3,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/mysterybox/comments/qvfeq/growing_pains/,"So with the release of our sidebar advert, which is awesome, we've went from around 20-50 impressions per day to around... 3000. Oh wow. For the new people, a few things worth noting:

1. You will see AK-47s next to some peoples' names. [That means they've sent a package](http://www.reddit.com/r/mysterybox/comments/p92qk/ak47s_for_verified_senders_special_criteria/) and can be trusted. If you send a package, please send us a link confirming that and we'll give you an AK-47 too. If you receive a package, **please post a picture thread**. This allows us an easy means of verifying that your sender sent, plus it's fun. **IF YOU HAVE AN AK-47 IN /r/SNACKEXCHANGE, /r/SPICEEXCHANGE, OR THE REDDITGIFTS.COM SNACK EXCHANGE #1, MESSAGE THE MODS FOR AN AK HERE AS WELL.**

2. This isn't the only subreddit of its kind. A few are linked on the sidebar, but there is everything from /r/snackexchange to /r/spiceexchange to /r/craftexchange to /r/beertrade and /r/teaexchange. If there's a niche, there's probably an exchange subreddit for it. If there isn't, create one and I'll link it on the sidebar as well as help set you up with a flair system (which is rather convoluted).

3. I kind of want to get a flag system going within the next few weeks, but it's really involved and I'm lazy. For now, **please include your location somewhere in your post**. International shipping is very different from domestic and some people may prefer to only send to one or the other.

4. [**Here is the guide to successful trading.**](http://www.reddit.com/r/mysterybox/comments/p92if/guide_to_successful_trading/) If yooth follow that, there shouldn't be a problem. There shouldn't anyway, but customs is filled with idiots. 

5. Scams are in the deep minority, but they can still happen. **CHECK USERPAGES BEFORE SENDING**. If they're new to reddit, you're essentially handing a box of stuff to a stranger on the street and then requesting that they meet you tomorrow at the same place with a box of stuff for you. We cannot police lurkers because they're lurkers, so you're trading at your own (albeit extremely low) risk. Keep an open heart and open eyes, and don't be afraid to ask for documentation that they actually sent something.

6. You do not have to use your real name if you don't want to. That's a concern for some and it's perfectly valid. Turn your username into a name or just add ""LLC"" after it and make it a business. This may not apply to all postal services and it may not apply if you use a credit card. 

7. We like to have fun here. Fun is mandatory. Are you having fun? Have fun. Have. Fun. **Now.**",,False,,t5_2stth,False,,ak47,True,t3_qvfeq,http://www.reddit.com/r/mysterybox/comments/qvfeq/growing_pains/,moderator

**Making a post:**

- The most important thing to consider in your title is your location. Not only do shipping costs vary wildly between countries, but potential exchangees may be enticed by the prospect of trading with someone from Canada when they otherwise wouldn't want to do this. 

- Context is another good thing to include. Things like your sex, your age, maybe a few of your hobbies or interests, these are all things which give an idea of what you're going to send. 

- Here is an example title and subtext from my perspective: [Title: 20/Male/France, looking to trade with someone abroad!] [Subtext box: I'm a history, medicine, poetry, and music geek, European cook, gamer, and bohemian. I'd prefer to trade with someone in Argentina or Uruguay!]

**Setting up the trade:**

- If someone messages you or comments, check their profile before going any further. Generally people aren't out to scam you, but around 5% of the trades in my /r/snackexchange fall through for one reason or another and **almost every single one of those is at the fault of someone with less than 6 months and 10.000 combined karma** (NOTE: Don't use that as law. Be weary of throwaway accounts and big lurkers, but use account activity and gut feeling as your guide rather than arbitrary numbers). You are trading at your own peril here, as the mods don't have the tools to help you if it goes south. Avoid trading with new accounts or very inactive accounts as a rule of thumb.

- Don't be pushy or overly specific. It's cool if there's something that you'd like to receive or that you can't receive (like if you're allergic to nuts, it's good to note that), but the entire idea of a mystery box is that you don't know what's inside. It's also important to note that it make take several days to set up your trade, as there's likely between several hours and half a day between you and your exchangee, and some of us only visit at specific times. Be calm and courteous and your exchangee will hopefully be the same. 

- Don't demand real-world identities. Some of us are totally okay with linking our usernames to our real names, but others are apprehensive. If that person gives you a username instead of their real name, don't take it as a sign that they're not taking this seriously. My Secret Santa packages come from Bursuc Fericit, very obviously not my name (""Happy Badger"" in Romanian), and have never been returned to me or rejected by customs. Just write ""Reddit"" as their surname. 

- The logistics of this are a bit tricky, but it's a good idea to exchange pictures of the postmarked boxes before sending them off just so you know that your exchangee is serious about it. Obviously the contents are another story, but if you are scammed at least you wasted both their time and a perfectly good box.

- **Make note of anything you cannot receive and why.** This cannot be stressed enough. If your immune system hates you or there are cultural, religious, or personal reasons why you cannot have something, it's your responsibility to speak up for yourself. 

**Readying your package:**

- First, make sure that you can actually send the things you're wanting to send. [**Here is an AMA from a customs agent detailing some of the things that can't be sent.**](http://www.reddit.com/r/snackexchange/comments/gwk38/iama_real_life_customs_officer_a_simple_set_of/) Every country has its own restrictions, and it's your responsibility to make sure that your package's contents don't go against them. It's also worth checking your exchangee's profile to see if there are any clues as to things which they definitely wouldn't like, even if they've not mentioned it. Don't send pork to Muslims, even if it's a really good meat.

- Your exchangee may not share your sense of humour. I can't really enforce this, but please don't troll your exchangee. Even if you don't respect their beliefs, respect that they're entitled to their own beliefs and don't send things with no intention other than to antagonise them. You just come off as a cock when you do that, and if it's really bad I'll probably end up banning you from all of my exchange subreddits and passing your username and the thread off to all the other exchange subreddits.

- Make it personal. You're sending your life in a box in exchange for another person's life in their box. Where are you from? What do you do? What fascinates you? What kind of things do you find beautiful? Mix CDs of your favourite music, rocks and soil from outside your home, personal mementos that you picked up in your travels, that one sweet or soda that you grew up craving, a recipe that your family swears by- these are things which turn a box of cheeky things into a box of sentimental things. Achieving a good balance between the two makes it all the better, as they now have something to play with and something to think about. 

- Please don't include illegal drugs. To save my own arse I have to ban any users which send illegal drugs. If you decide to ignore this warning, at least look up a guide first so you don't end up in a cell. It's also worth noting that not everyone is an ent and not every ent is in an ent-friendly environment, so it's just generally a bad idea which could get all of us in trouble. 

- Package everything securely. All couriers are bad. All couriers will beat your package like an Irishman's wife. Wrap things in a way that ensures they won't break. It's also a bad idea to include things which may break, like glass or flimsy wood, as they'll probably break. 

- Fill out all customs forms as accurately as possible. This is very, very important. Customs will tear apart your package if it doesn't comply with their rules. Print neatly, list the contents accurately, and don't give them any reason to open your package. 

**Receiving your package:**

- Give it a few weeks, especially where international trades are concerned. A good rule of thumb is two weeks for a domestic package, six for an international. Don't press your exchangee for updates constantly, but do ask for a tracking number (NOTE: The receipt number sometimes functions as one. They will always receive a receipt when sending the package through a post office) once just so that you're aware of the status of the package. 

- It's a good idea to have your exchangee include a package note which tells the courier where to put your package, something like ""Please leave behind the bush next to the door"" or ""please leave at front desk"". It's also a good idea to not leave packages on your doorstep if the courier tends to come when you're not home.

- Please make a picture post showing off your package's contents. This does two things. First, it allows anyone searching my name to see that I have successfully traded before. Second, it's entertaining. I really like those posts, they're pretty much the entire reason I made the subreddit. **If you make a picture post, please censor the shipping label.** Any identifying information is fair game to anyone viewing the photo, and there are some sick people out there. Black out names, addresses, and tracking numbers. 

- Please message the mod(s) with a link to a picture post of your package by your exchangee. I'll(we'll) give you an AK-47 for that, which labels you as a verified sender. ",,False,,t5_2stth,True,,ak47,True,t3_p92if,http://www.reddit.com/r/mysterybox/comments/p92if/guide_to_successful_trading/,

So much cool (and Canadian) stuff - I hope my box doesn't disappoint!

The Walking Dead comic is awesome - I love the show and was not even aware there was a comic (I don't really know much about comics).

I assume ""How To Be Good"" is some sort of user guide to being Canadian (or maybe it's a novel - either way, I will find out soon).

Rum?  Seriously?  Rum?  Fan-freaking-tastic.

Some awesome buttons.  A few snacks.  One of my sons (a huge hockey fan) has claimed the flag and it's already hanging on his walls.  A kick-ass scifi post card.

The beach photo reminds me that I haven't been the beach lately and need to go.

The USB drive ... let me plug it in right now ... Um ... AWESOME!  Music galore.

Rum and music?  My night just got planned (and since my wife works tonight I don't need to share, right?).

Seriously - awesome box.

I got half way through setting up the box for the first girl and she stopped responding to my messages. So I didn't finish it and answered another girl's request to do a trade. 

We talked for awhile. I got the box finished and we agreed to send it out on the same day (so we could get them about the same time hopefully.) I go to message her to make sure the day we picked still worked ( I was on my way out the door to ship it and thought I should double check) and she's deleted her account. 

So that didn't go out. 


Now I have a box ready and nobody to ship to. So if you are a female (Sorry it's kinda geared towards girls) and want to SERIOUSLY trade. Please let me know. 

At this point I kinda prefer someone who has done this before. Just so stuff like this doesn't happen again. 

I'm willing to send you any kind of proof that you need to show that I have a box ready to go. 


I've really been looking forward to trading and I'm kinda bummed that my last two fell through like this. SO let me know. :D 


EDIT: UPDATE: 

I found someone guys. :D Thank you so much for all the offers. :) It means a lot to me that so many of you were  willing to help me out. :)

I'll pre-face this by saying that war sucks. I'm liberal to the point of obnoxiousness and don't like that countless people have died and that even more artefacts and buildings have been left ruined in the wake of the past decade. 

However, I'll also pre-face it by saying that being in a war probably sucks. Yes they volunteered for it, but I've only met one soldier who legitimately joined up to kill people and he was defective on a level that made me think he didn't quite understand what death was. They're kids trapped in a place that's nothing like home and people are shooting at them because some twat with little stars on his shirt said they had to be there instead of somewhere safe as his career depends on making statistics out of lives. 

We as a subreddit aren't supporting this because we're pro-war, but because we're pro-human. A human is having a shit time in a shit place where they're told to do shit things by shit people and a box can bring them a little bit of joy that any of us would want if we were in their shoes. Even if you hate the war, and by all means you bloody well should, if nothing else think about exchanging to brighten someone else's day. Da.

Send a mysterybox to those that serve our country! Recently, I (JustinJ113) received a letter back from one of the units I have been sending care packages to. They love receiving odd gifts, such as the slinkies and bacon-flavored toothpaste I recently sent them.


I thought it would be a great idea to start a mysterybox campaign with the CST-25, 8th Maritime Expeditionary Security Deployment. They sent me back some cool stuff, such as a flag and a challenge coin. I spoke with their Sgt. and he said he would do his best to send something back to everyone that sent the unit something.


Little background info: Their base, Camp Mike Spann, is named after a CIA operative that was one of the first Americans killed in 2001 during the campaign into Iraq.

Send them a small mysterybox to: SSG Gary A. Hall HHC 37th IBCT Camp Mike Spann APO AE 09368

PLEASE NOTE: Please include in the box, a letter explaining about Reddit and the mysterybox subreddit. Just a simple explanation about what mysterybox does and include your address so they can send something back. Also include email if you want, as they do have access to email and Facebook.

Please don't send any food except for candy. These boxes are opened and inspected before reaching their base, so we don't want anything illegal or against their listed items that might have to be sent back, like knives or stuff like that.

Here's a quick run-down of the contents:

2 books (The Omnivore's Dilemma by Michael Pollan and In a Sunburned Country by Bill Bryson)

2 cds (one by Hawksley Workman - and the inspiration for TheDeliciousWolves' username, and one by the Tragically Hip). I'm adding them to my library as I write this)

tea! I can't wait to try this - and it gave the entire box and delicious smell

Candy Cane bath salts

A recipe for carrot cake - I have to be honest, I hate carrots. Can't eat 'em. But, my step-dad loves carrot cake, so I'm totally going to make this for him for his next birthday!

Field Notes memo book

Godiva chocolate candy and a caramel apple pop (!!)

4 totally fun stickers (including R2D2 :)

A flower for Rememberance Day (Nov. 11 in Canada)

The blowout card - ah, the joys of children :)

I'm currently an English teacher in Japan. On monday nights I run an english conversation class. 
I just recently learned about mystery box and told my class about it. I also asked if they'd like to try it as a group. 

So here's what would happen. 
They gather a few items and put it in a box for you. You send me a box back and we open it together. 

The group consist of 7 adult students. They would all pitch in one or two things. So you wouldn't feel like you have to cram a box for a whole class. Just a few magical things. 

Mind you, this is stuff that they put together, so as to what will be in the box is even a mystery to me.

I was so excited when I saw it setting on my porch this morning! And when I opened it I was even happier! 

It was packaged very nicely, and wrapped in beautiful tissue paper (that I tore off too quickly to get a picture of!) but I appreciate all the effort that went into packing it too!

She sent a lovely [card](http://i.imgur.com/aCCKS.jpg) that explained what everything was. I did read it last because I love surprises!

This box had everything in it - some delicious looking [salsa](http://i.imgur.com/kCx7k.jpg) that I can't wait to try, some [tea](http://i.imgur.com/s35AB.jpg) ( I love tea!), [The Teachings of Buddha](http://i.imgur.com/3zREe.jpg) that I'm very much looking forward to reading, a [camera bag](http://i.imgur.com/UDuLY.jpg) and ""lens pen"". I have never owned a lens pen and my gifter said it would become my best friend... 

well, how right she was! We used it on my sisters expensive camera she got for Christmas with a malfunctioning lens, and it cleaned it! It works now (the first time it has since she got it!), so thank you from my sister too!

She also included what at first glance appeared to be [Russian nesting dolls](http://i.imgur.com/CFq9w.jpg), which I loved...but turned out to be even better - they are also measuring cups! Adorable measuring cups!

I got a [robot](http://i.imgur.com/NJBCS.jpg) that keeps cords and wires together - which will alleviate many migraines, I believe!

A [lint roller](http://i.imgur.com/Q3WFT.jpg) - I have a house full of dogs and cats, so I am always in need of a lint roller!

Some very wonderful smelling [incense](http://i.imgur.com/u73wF.jpg) and [soaps](http://i.imgur.com/1nuwE.jpg) and...

one of my favorite things in the box - [handmade earrings](http://i.imgur.com/1ihhp.jpg) made by my gifter! They are beautiful!!! 

I love [everything](http://i.imgur.com/M1MCP.jpg) I got, and my gifter went above and beyond what I expected! Thank you SO MUCH!!!

I opened the Ron Paul sticker-ed box to find a cryptic message that said ""The flashdrive explains everything!"" and proceeded to find my favorite item in the box - a [teddy bear](http://i.imgur.com/L7CwY.jpg) from his highschool with his mascot and colors, with a flashdrive around his neck! 

I watched the flashdrive and at first the only thing I could find on it was a video of him bathing a cat. That didn't explain anything to me and I sat there wondering what context I was missing...then I realized there was a text doc as well and *that* is what would offer the explanation!

Well the explanation and the contents of the box blew me away! Not only did he send me three awesome books (we both love to read and now I can learn a new language with my English/Spanish dictionary, study some impressive artwork of Mass Effect, and get some healing with a new book on Buddhism), but also a local magazine (the 4/20 edition :P) that despite living near the area, I hadn't heard of. 

I got a bunch of candies and gum! I was *just* saying that I really needed some Rolos before I got them in the mail!

He also included a Game Informer t-shirt that's super soft, a Mario Galaxy Christmas ornament, some Burts Bees chapstick, a Magic card, some D&amp;D dice (I've played D&amp;D a couple of times and loved it!), some incense, &amp; what I thought was weed upon first glance, but actually turned out to be a locally grown herb that can flavor meats, or be used in teas. It also helps with lucid dreaming and relaxation. :)

I got a lighter and some matches, a bouncy ball (because who doesn't love bouncy balls?!) a can opener that I **will** use, and 2 CDs with some of his favorite music. (That also happens to be some of my favorite music!)

**AND** he included... A [GAMEBOY ADVANCE](http://i.imgur.com/jx1UT.jpg). With batteries &amp; with a game, one I hadn't played, Pokemon Leaf Green! I was in love with Pokemon Blue so I know I'll love this one!

This Redditor was excellent and truly deserves a second box from me. I swear - I want to put together something else for him. ...Maybe for Arbitrary day....

This goes outside the rules a bit, I asked a moderator and they approved it though warned me that it may set off a few cranky people. I'm going to risk it and adjust as needed and delete if I have to. 

I'd like to point out that this is not meant to make anyone angry. Lets try to look at it from an adult perspective and if you are upset by it, just move on. Please and Thanks!

I have some items from Victoria's Secret. They were for an ex, who never received them. I won't say what is in the box. But, one lucky member will receive the box. If I have 2-3 people interested I may try to split it up. I'll worry about that when I get there. 

Important bits. The sizes are 36C and Medium. You must be able to wear these sizes! If you do not fit these sizes do not reply. 

None of it has been worn, so you're safe there. It just wasn't given to the ex, and it all passed return period (that's what I get for buying on a sale well before a birthday, lesson learned). So, I can't return it. Thus, a giveaway. 

I would like proof that you can wear it and those who send an image with my handle in it /u/gkss will get bonus points for proving you are who you say you are. I suspect this may be where some of the complaints begin, but, realize this is extremely easy for someone to just say they fit but then sell it on ebay for some cash. This stuff isn't cheap, as I'm sure many of you can attest to. This is a very generous gift, we're talking triple digits worth of things. So, I'm serious about the ""it must fit you"" rule. 

PM me for details and I'll be happy to try to help. 

And, sorry for breaking the rules, this one just sort of requires breaking the rules to make sure it fits the recipient(s). Also, sorry to anyone offended by this. I'm trying to turn something not fun (a break up) into something fun (the giving of a gift or two). I hope you can respect that. 

Edit: I have 4 interested ladies. Only one has pics confirmed. Just a small update. Each has been incredibly nice. Despite the negativity in comments and in down votes. So, if you read this, gotta get pics quick before its gone. I'm splitting 2-3 ways.

Edit2 - 06/08/2013 - I have my two recipients. I've let them both know, anyone else, sorry! Stay tuned though as I will be doing at least one more of these, in a slightly different way :) 

Due to the nature of this one, I'm not going to say who received these, as, well, privacy is something I respect in this particular instance.

We are going to go old school and do like the sidebar says: ""It's about trading you, but in box form. You send a box filled with things from your life, you receive a box filled with things from someone else's life, then you post pictures and we have a gay old time. ...Trade the things that make you.""

I don't want to tell age or sex (but we do need locations), and I don't want us to tell each other what our hobbies and interests are.  I want to trade things I enjoy for things you enjoy.  

I think this will be more fun than finding someone with similar interests and trading similar types of items.  I even used my alt. account so you can't cheat by going through my comments!  If you reply I promise not to look and see who you are either.  

And if I send you something you can't use (a spatula, but you hate cooking) or I receive something that I don't want (your collection of 10 year's worth of bellybutton lint), well, we'll have a good story and maybe something to donate to goodwill.

I will have a couple of questions for the person who takes me up on this offer, but they are just to find out if you can actually, physically use certain items I plan to send.  I won't ask them until I get a trading partner.

I'm in the U.S.A., and willing to spend 30-40$ on shipping.  That means a bigger box for someone within the states, or a smaller box for someone farther away.

I have an 87-year-old grandmother who always wanted to go to Australia.  In 1994, she and my grandfather planned a trip with his siblings.  That summer, my grandfather passed away and both of his siblings died within a year.  My grandma was the sole caretaker of their mentally-disabled son and never felt comfortable enough to leave him with another caretaker after that time.  Now she's 87 and is not up to long-distance travel.  For Christmas, I'd like to bring Australia to her.

I am offering US/Southwest goods in exchange for AUS items of interest to an elderly woman. My hope is  to include things like postcards, novels, and things I don't even know about yet to provide her with a suitcase full of Australia for Christmas.  I plan to do this through as many exchanges as it takes.  I'm AK'd on /r/snackexchange, have done a successful trade on here (but my recepient did not post his box, I do have a PM where he acknowledges receipt), and have successfully participated in three RedditGifts exchanges, so I hope my credentials are solid.  If you're interested, please let me know what you'd like to exchange for and a dollar-range of items you're willing to provide. I have access to all US candies, several flavors of oreos, cereal, etc., and TONS of Mexican candy, being in Arizona.  I can also make a typical mystery box, if you would prefer a surprise.

I may have to do a couple every two weeks as I get paid, but I want to make this idea happen. I plan to cross-post this on /r/snackexchage and /r/australia (if allowed), so if you see it more than once, that's why.",,False,,t5_2stth,False,,,True,t3_101cjh,http://www.reddit.com/r/mysterybox/comments/101cjh/us_seeking_aus_for_unique_exchange/,

Essentially, this will function in the same way that r/snackexchange functions. To pull off a successful trade, please structure your post something like this:

Title: &lt;location/desired location(s)&gt; &lt;something about you to entice a trade&gt; ""ROM seeking RUS/AUS - Career cosmopolite, artist, and musician""

Subtext: &lt;Pricing/size limitations, special requests&gt; ""Let's keep it under $30 shipping, so maybe a two kilogramme box at most. I've been feeling pretty nostalgic lately, so the theme of the trade is our childhood."" 

To keep it fun, keep requests to a minimum and keep them broad. It's fine if you want to set a theme, but if you set it as ""VIDEO GAMES INVOLVING MARIO PRE-1992"" you're going to get Super Mario Brothers for $30. There's no sense in doing that.

**To avoid being scammed**: 

- Check user history. This isn't a perfect method by any means and you shouldn't anticipate being scammed, but if someone signed up yesterday they have no reputation to lose by fucking you over. If they're a troll, it'd probably help their case.

- Check shipping details with each other. Confirmation codes sometimes function as tracking numbers. Tracking numbers are a godsend when trading internationally, since customs hell has plagued exchanges fairly consistently in the past. 

- Make sure details are clear. Size of the parcel, price of the shipping, or number of things- this isn't a ""I hope I get a new iPod!"" kind of deal by any stretch and you shouldn't go into it thinking that, but have some agreed upon point so that you both get around the same number of things. 

**To avoid being a cock:**

- Don't be a cock. It's hilarious that you put dog poo in a box, truly, but someone halfway across the planet is standing by their postbox anticipating your parcel. It's just incredibly rude of you if you go out of your way to ruin their day. Plus they have your address and meatspace name, so there's always a chance that you're trading with Leon. 

Oh, and verification. Once we get a few successful trades, I'll institute flairification in the same vein as snackexchange. To get your flair, you have to message the moderators (also taking moderators- speak up if you'd like a spot) with a link to a thread by your exchangee confirming the trade.

Given how liberal a website we are I'm sure most of you are as anti-war as I am, but regardless of our opinions on the matter it must fucking *suck* to be stuck in Afghanistan. Mysterybox and Snackexchange are supporting it as human-to-human.

-an I &lt;3 New York t-shirt

-a very lovely NASA pin, space pen, and mini lunar rover

-a wind-up toy robot (extra neat since I collect wind-up tin robots. This will fit in nicely!)

-a clone trooper toy

-a couple of JSA figures (complete with backdrop)

-some promo material for Marvel vs Capcom 3

-a green patch which is very mysterious as I have no idea what it's from or what it symbolizes

-a tiny skateboard

-a deck of cards (which shall be added to my collection)

-a classic balsa wood airplane kit

-my very own marching band gloves

-a Hollywood postcard with some kind words on them

-and some new reading material for the throne (handy, as my subscription to Wired ended last year)


Now LooneyLopez, Looney, you may have noticed you don't have a box in your mail yet. That's because the very day I was assembling yours, I received my box and was blown away. I realized instantly that I couldn't send you the piddly little box I had made, so this weekend I'm going to my storage locker and fishing out some neat stuff for you. I'll be mailing it out on Monday-ish and you should receive it by the end of next week.

A letter, explaining the contents.
Collared shirt (Microsoft logo, blue) - It makes me smile to think about a sea of navy blue tech conference attendees.
Electronic Musician (June, 1993) - Publication from the Digital Age!
Kokomo sheet music - Straight from 1988, and my elementary school Music class.
B-52s - Hot tracks! ""Roam"" is my jam.
""The 360 Leader"" book - My old job involved reading leadership books. This reminds me that I'm happier not reading leadership books.
Guitar picks - Personalized! Now I know that ForMoreBestPower ""came to play guitar and bang my mom!"".
Garbage Pail Kid card - I collected these, too. Rather, my brother did. I was afraid of them.
A mixed CD from a dubious source - I'll refrain from saying much (due to its source) so I'll just say that I listened, and it's fine, if you like cheery faux Celtic bar bands. I almost fell over when I heard ""Mari-Mac"", since that's a song I've been hearing all my life from cheery Celtic bar bands.

Before our trade, we had mentioned we were both into videogames, Buffy, and similar literary genres, but I am surprised by how many things in this box I absolutely love. I swing dance (Louis Armstrong CD), love comic books, collect foreign coins, play Magic: The Gathering, and am a Pac Man fiend.

This box was amazing, and I can't believe how much stuff she managed to cram in there! Even the box, which had a horse on it, was awesome!

It also had some amazing fossils and sea shells, along with some great sea glass. I have never seen sea glass before so this was really a treat!

(special criteria available as well),9,0,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/mysterybox/comments/p92qk/ak47s_for_verified_senders_special_criteria/,"Continuing the programme offered in /r/snackexchange, anyone who is a verified mystery box sender will get an AK-47 next to their name in the subreddit. It's highly recommended that you trade with people who have AK-47s, as they can be trusted to send packages.

**SPECIAL NOTES:**

- An AK-47 will also be granted to you if you have participated in either /r/snackexchange, /r/spiceexchange, or the redditgifts.com **SNACK EXCHANGE #1** mass exchange. I may expand this in the future, especially for exchange subreddits that I run, and I will note that in new posts. Any other trades in any other subreddits won't count toward your AK-47 in this one. 

- An AK-47 earned in this subreddit will also count in /r/snackexchange and /r/spiceexchange, but I'm only going to toss them up if you actually plan to use either subreddit. **Please don't message me for an AK-47 in those subreddits unless you plan to trade there.** It's a huge pain in the arse to change flair, especially if there are dozens of people asking at once. 

- **You have to [MESSAGE THE MODS](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23mysterybox) to get your AK-47**. Please include a link to a thread which confirms that you sent a package. Again, if you're posting another subreddit's exchange make sure that it fits the first bullet's criteria and that you actually intend to trade here. 

- AK-47s will be removed from all subreddits if a future post of yours falls through by your fault. This includes scamming, but does not include acts of god or post. If the courier mucks up or someone steals the package after it has been delivered, you will not lose any standing.

This time from fellow Redditor, Theegorrila! 

First, his [note](http://i.imgur.com/odilq.jpg) - explaining everything in the box...

Then, an [energy drink](http://i.imgur.com/qUcN3.jpg) that I'm sure was absolutely delicious (it was punctured in the shipping though, and had leaked, but luckily dried on the way as well! in the box)...so I didn't get to try it, but the box smelled like fruity energy so I'm sure it was good!

There was also an adorable [Eeyore](http://i.imgur.com/WV7ys.jpg), with removable tail!, because Disney.

A [Children of Bodom](http://i.imgur.com/yzZQS.jpg) cd. I have not heard of them so I'm excited about learning of a new band!

A [Beatles record](http://i.imgur.com/Otv2v.jpg)! Gotta pull my record player out of storage and put it to work!

A really heavy [Ford Mustang emblem](http://i.imgur.com/9mL9j.jpg) - (Which is funny because I debated about sending thegorrila a Dodge emblem from my vehicle...great minds!) 

A [necklace](http://i.imgur.com/K5rUC.jpg) (I'm assuming from my gifters recent trip to Hawaii!?) It's awesome btw!

A [49ers wall flag](http://i.imgur.com/t2fc1.jpg)!

[Portable. Speakers.](http://i.imgur.com/r7wg2.jpg)  Wait...maybe I didn't say that loud enough - **PORTABLE SPEAKERS**. I am so thrilled with these. Earbuds are not my friends - especially when working out. So to be able to just plug my mp3 player into these bad boys is amazing!

And my two favorite things in the box - two drawings done just for me, by my gifter! - One of [GIR](http://i.imgur.com/vtDuq.jpg), which is adorable. And the other..*swoon* my absolute favorite - [Pyramid Head](http://i.imgur.com/OB07H.jpg). I am in love with Pyramid Head and this picture is perfect!

There was also some of my gifters favorite chips (that what I got to taste were very delicious) although my brother ate them and threw the bag away before I could snap a picture!

So that is my second Mysterybox exchange. I'm sending my third box out tomorrow and can't wait to see what I'm getting from my next MB redditor!

Since I am the Grand Master of Procrastination (also had a bad cold), I kicked the can down the road, until the next URGENT, IMPORTANT thing was overdue. To avoid doing it, here the report for 8serene8's mystery box:

[Mystery box arrived](http://i.minus.com/ibx51z0kAQqGKt.jpg)

Tension mounts - the box is f... huge. A quick [look on top](http://i.minus.com/ibe0nKK3k7XMlz.jpg). The customs documents have 4 (!) different sheets, how did she manage to cram so much into it?

[Unpacking the mystery box - a nice letter on top.](http://i.minus.com/iVVQC0bMZ6LZ0.jpg)

[The overview.](http://i.minus.com/itiivYwy0R0m.jpg) Sweets, a bobble hat and a scarf, shirts for my daughter's teddy bears, books, DVDs, postcards, buttons, pictures, some jewelry and a 2$-bill from the US mint in pristine condition. Awesome. Even cat pics!

There's also some incense in there, I snuck it into the living room to give some change of atmosphere. So far, no complaints. I seem to be the only one to smell it, though.

[Some more details](http://i.minus.com/it0Z4KA8zWZaI.jpg). Books and DVDs, tea, crayons, and sweets. 

One of the highlights - my daughter with the [scarf](http://i.minus.com/iUFxtj22C89Ee.jpg) and the [bobble hat](http://i.minus.com/isi29OjPWFCZf.jpg). She likes both of them, and the weather turned cold just in time to wear them.

[Sweets and buttons](http://i.minus.com/ibfNxah8beHpXT.jpg). The question for me is: Do men turn gay if they eat these things?

Overall, a pleasant surprise and a welcome change from my experiences with secret santa where I gifted thrice and got nothing back. Unfortunately, Yin and Yang have conspired to screw over my gifter instead, since the box I sent is long overdue.

I didn't get anything back from the postal service, so hope is there that it's just stuck in customs, but this sours my fun a bit, especially since my giftee made such an effort and I am really happy with what I got.

I'm quite new at reddit with no submissions/comments yet, I hope someone will do a trade with me anyway! :)
For my first trade I will prefer someone who lives in Europe to minimize the shipping costs.
Some random facts about me: I live in Copenhagen, Denmark with my 2 cats. I like cats! I like dogs too though - especially wiener dogs! In general, I'm really fond of animals.
Some stuff I love: 'Cow &amp; Chicken', 'SpongeBob SquarePants', 'Fraggle Rock' and 'The Moomins' (especially 'Little My', she's awsome!) and 'The Nightmare Before Christmas'.
I probably drink too much coffee and eat too much candy.
I love skulls and skeletons, gothic and horror stuff.
Studied BSc in Economics and Business Administration.
I listen to metal music and go to quite a lot of concerts (mostly small danish bands).

... anyone up for a trade? :)

You:
A fellow redditor too impatient to wait on a doorbell, to deal with stuff being lost in the mail, or more paranoid about handing out an address than being there in person. Location in the DMV is a must. Location off an exit on the interstate in the 40-50 range is a plus. Maybe we can find a midpoint and even catch a movie together?

No, I'm not going to dump an assortment of furniture on you.

(not saying that's what I'm including, but you know...) And if *you*'ve got dumbbells and paperweights to trade, that's cool too. Scale-wise, it has to fit inside a regular old car. Also! Gotta be able to survive at least an hour or two in the heat. No dead bodies in the trunk. I don't need that stank.

I have been in recovery for about 3 years. I didn't have much of a childhood so i like the little girl
Cool novelty items. I have an amazing pen collection for doodling and writing. I also consider my iPhone 4S my most prized possession never go or do anything with out it. It is jail broken. I have been collecting cases gadgets and accessories for it. I love candy not so much chocolate as gummy type things and taffy. Well I could go on and on but would live to trade with someone!!
