Where I live there is a second-hand bookstore.  The way that they're set up, is that you bring in your old books and they'll give you 1/4 the jacket value as store credit.  All books in the store are priced at 1/2 the jacket price tag.

My whole family loves to read.  We're always reading books.

I found out about the bookstore about 4 years ago, and took in all of the books that I had collected since I seriously started reading, in my teens.  When it was all said and done, I had about $3500 (USD) in-store credit.  I still have $250 of it left.  I'll tell you about a time that I spent 200 of those dollars.

I had stopped in just to browse, because ""hey, why not?""  Anytime I was near I would stop in and pick up a pile of books.  The day that I was there, there was a woman and her young son buying some books.  I didn't really see what she had, but they looked like used textbooks.

The kid was standing near the childrens section, which is pitiful by the way, holding two different tattered books.  His mom said something like, ""Sorry, I've only got enough money for one.""

You know the thing that's been floating around reddit for a little bit?  The whole ""in the feels"" thing?  Well, that's where it hit me.  Right in the fucking feels.

I kind of hovered around the store, trying not to be a creepy weirdo, waiting for them to head to the checkout.  We were the only customers in the store, so I got in line right in front of her.  When I was talking to the clerk, they love to chat there, I asked how much store credit I had left.  At the time, it was probably around $700-$800.  I asked the woman behind me if I could buy their books for them.  I told them that it wasn't really money at all to me.  I told her how I had brought a bunch of old books in, and have a ton of in-store credit.  She said yes, with a huge smile on her face, and told her son to run back and get that other book.  I told the clerk to write her up a $200 voucher, picked up my books, and went home.

tl;dr

Anyway, that's how I lost my medical license.",,False,,t5_2rl8w,False,,,True,t3_zrolv,http://www.reddit.com/r/bookexchange/comments/zrolv/i_posted_this_in_an_raskreddit_thread_but_thought/,

Unlike the fine subreddit /r/BookExchange where users make private trades, the books in /r/TravelingBooks are considered community property, available for free to anyone who asks. The only conditions are that **users must offer a book back to the community when they are done with it, and they must sign and date the book before passing it on so we can all see where it's been and how far it's traveled!** Ever owned a used book and wondered where it's been? If it's from /r/TravelingBooks, now you'll know!

[There is already a thread for *1984* in the new subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/TravelingBooks/comments/1i45o9/nineteen_eightyfour_by_george_orwell/), and I have at least two more copies to hand out to those who are interested. Please come join us!

^(~~This thread is for the circular exchange of George Orwell's epic book. If you have a copy to share, post below. If you want to borrow a copy, do the same. There are only two conditions for the recipients. First, when you are done with the book, you must return to this thread and offer it up to another redditor.

I have been holding onto a lot of books, for a very long time, that I will never read again. In many cases it's because I've gone through a massive paradigm shift in my life, and in other cases it's just because I was in that strange zone of liking the book enough to not want to get rid of it and never really expecting to read it again.

I used to be extremely religious. Went to Bible college and everything. There are a lot of Christian books here. Some of them were so influencial in my life that even though I no longer adhere to their brand of faith, it is still really tough to get rid of them. But, not everything is Christian, so don't discount the list if you're not of that flavor.

I have more books, I just haven't gone through them yet. I'll post an updated list later.

**EDIT:** Someone asked about my current tastes in case anyone had anything to offer. I like to read horror and really good sci-fi. Fantasy too, but I don't read much anymore. I'm still very spiritual, just agnostic. I love examining the human condition and want to better understand our existence. I'm trying to catch up on some of the science must-haves as well. I've never read Darwin, Sagan, or Degrasse-Tyson. I need to.

**EDIT 2:** I didn't expect this to take off tonight. I thought perhaps in the morning I'd have a few messages and more would filter in throughout the day. Please bear with me as I go through them all. It's first-come-first-served when a book has been requested by multiple people. Once I have it organized I'll cross already-claimed books off of the list. Please bear with me.

**EDIT 3:** Okay, I've marked my spreadsheet with the books that are already taken and the username of the first person to claim it. If there is one that you want that is taken, please take that up with the person who requested it. There were a few private messages in which a book was requested before it was requested here in the comments. The list reflects that.

There are novels, comics, manga volumes, and some nonfiction texts. It's every book I've bought in the last decade or so.

I'm poor, and I don't have a lot of space. I would be relieved to know that these books were leaving at no extra expense to me. If you're interested in the whole lot, you can have it as long as you pay for shipping. Estimating the shipping is going to be very hard, but I can get a rough idea.

I tried to organise the books coherently a long time ago, but they're in a sort of jumble. If you want to find an author, you're best off searching the page. I've attempted to note the quality of each book. I was quite strict with this. Good is better than you'd tend to find a second-hand book. Some of this formatting is a little messy. I apologise. The box numbers are for me; they don't signify anything.

[I stole this whole idea](http://www.reddit.com/r/bookexchange/comments/1b59b8/giving_away/). I hope that's okay.

**EDIT:** Some of you are asking where I'm shipping from. Sadly for your wallets, the answer is London, UK. If you want to get a rough sense of how affordable the shipping costs are, use [this site](http://www.royalmail.com/price-finder). You'll need to know how many books you're buying. For those who live in the US, assuming that the mean weight of the books I'm selling is ~400 grammes (which is, I believe, a liberal estimate) and that you don't mind waiting a few weeks for the book, you're looking at $7 for a single book.

**EDIT 2013-05-16:** I'm really heartened by everyone's response! Thank you all for your interest, and your help in allowing me to declutter. I apologise for the delay before my replies. Timeline difference and all that.

Specifically, this week's book is a paper back copy of [The Age of Spiritual Machines by Ray Kurzweil](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Age_of_Spiritual_Machines).

As usual, I'm going to take names in comments and then hold a random drawing to determine the winner.  The cutoff to be included in the raffle will be Midnightish PST on Sunday, **May 6th**.  I will ship the book for free to anybody in the United States.  International Redditors are welcome to participate, but I'll ask you to cover shipping.  I plan on doing this until I run out of books or money, so if you win a book from me you won't be eligible again for 99 years.  Good luck to all those who participate, and I will update this post to announce a winner.

Spoiler alert: she doesn't.  

Here's a case for why you shouldn't totally dismiss them:

* It's actually bearable if you read them imagining that these books are a first person insight to a girl with severe mental issues.  

* Like it or not, it's somewhat of a cultural phenom at the moment, and it's nice to know what everyone's talking about 

* It's fun to hate 

* You can fully appreciate the bad reviews the series got (they definitely get funnier once you've experienced the terribleness)

* Some of the sex scenes are actually pretty hot


Anyways, I got halfway through the second one and decided enough was enough.  I do not want them on my bookshelf anymore.  In return I want a book that will redeem my poor judgement (Your choice, I'm down for anything).

___________________




I've decided to clear out my bookshelf.  I have a pile of used science books on various topics.  relativity,  astronomy, psychology, quantum mechanics, space, time, earth history, various math topics, etc.  These aren't popular best-sellers from ""big names"" that you've heard of, but they are still interesting nonetheless. ;)



I also have a bunch of books on stuff like philosophy, history, politics, economics,  persuasion/sales, free will, and other random non-fiction topics.  Most of the books were written in the past 15 years, and are written for a ""normal"" educated person.  Others are college textbooks on topics like ethics, argumentation, critical thinking,  etc.  They can be somewhat ""heavy"" reading, probably best for someone who really wants to get deep into these issues and is willing to put in a few hours of reading at a time without distractions.



I plan to create some ""grab boxes"" of 3-4 books to send out, so if you tell me a few of the subjects you are interested in, I will try to create a decent mix.  I can't guarantee you will like them all, or get the exact topics you asked for, but hopefully you will be interested in at least a few of them, and can donate the rest to a used bookstore.  :)",,False,,t5_2rl8w,1338890836.0,,,True,t3_uecdq,http://www.reddit.com/r/bookexchange/comments/uecdq/send_sciencephilosophyrelated_books_want_nothing/,

I will ship the book for free to anybody in the United States.  International Redditors are welcome to participate, but I'll ask you to cover shipping.

Giveaways inside!,39,12,62,http://www.reddit.com/r/bookexchange/comments/10fa50/my_reddit_bookstore_volume_1_giveaways_inside/,"Hey r/bookexchange users, My name is springbroke and I'm a young man on a mission. I'm looking to make a little extra income and make a little extra space in my apartment, so I come to you with an idea. I want to run a used bookstore through reddit. I don't know about you, but I'm not entirely crazy about online shopping for books, records, or anything that shows some sort of expression of what your personality is like. I'll admit, purchasing through amazon is very easy and convenient, but it's just not the same as walking through a used book store, smelling the scent of old books, and talking likes/dislikes with employees and other customers. That's why I want to try to bring this experience to the online community. I intend on personalizing each order (with ways I like to keep secret, for now!) and helping bring the buyer and seller a little closer, whilst also maintaining cheap prices! I messaged the moderators and they were gracious enough to let me post here, and if this picks up some steam I'll probably post here once a week for a couple of weeks, and then try to move to my own subreddit or something. To stay in the spirit of the subreddit though, I will kick this off with a few giveaways that will hopefully be of interest to you, to showcase my excitement to be doing this.  
  
**CONTESTS**  
  I plan on doing a lot of contests and giveaways, sometimes they'll be on certain days, sometimes they'll be completely at random. Some may have a theme, some may not! The first books I am giving away are from my personal collection and are books that I love dearly. All you have to do to be entered to win is tell me in the comments some ideas that could help improve my reddit bookstore experience, and some things you'd like to see for sale! I acquire a lot of my books through yard sales and whatnot, so I can't fill every request, but I will make a note and make sure to hunt for you! I will choose the winners at random and you will be notified via PM. Please list in the comments which book you'd like to win! The books up for grabs are:  
  *The Essential Calvin And Hobbes*  by Bill Watterson  
  *The Grapes Of Wrath* by John Steinbeck  
  *Naked* by David Sedaris

As for the actual books for sale, here is what I am offering this week. I intend on posting around 20-25 books per week, as to keep everything fresh and interesting. Keep in mind that these books are used, so they may have a little wear, but I've tried to ""grade"" these books based on condition (A being like new, F being very poor condition) and will list why it received the grade. If the book is a first edition, I will put a (1E) next to it as well. All books are paperback unless otherwise noted. Pictures are available upon request!

This week's book will be the beginning of a 3 part series on Comic Books/Graphic Novels.  I'll start off the series with [The Essential Uncanny X-Men Volume 1 by Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, et al](http://www.amazon.com/Essential-Classic-X-Men-Volume-1/dp/0785109919/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1337645711&amp;sr=8-1).  This includes issues 1 - 24 of the original Uncanny X-Men series in a single edition.  

As usual, I'm going to take names in comments and then hold a random drawing to determine the winner.  The cutoff to be included in the raffle will be Midnightish PST on Sunday, **May 27th**.  I will ship the book for free to anybody in the United States.  International Redditors are welcome to participate, but I'll ask you to cover shipping.  I plan on doing this until I run out of books or money, so if you win a book from me you won't be eligible again for 99 years.  Also, please **don't enter with throwaway accounts**.  There is a 99.9% chance you won't log back in with the throwaway, which means you won't see my attempts to contact you should you win.  Good luck to all those who participate, and I will update this post to announce a winner.

**UPDATE: The winner is [Quaquaversal](/u/Quaquaversal).**

There is a 99.9% chance you won't log back in with the throwaway, which means you won't see my attempts to contact you should you win.  Good luck to all those who participate, and I will update this post to announce a winner.

**UPDATE: The winner is [channel26](/u/channel26).**

I've decided to offer what I'm calling ""Book Exchange 3 packs"", and it's pretty much what you probably think it is, a trifecta of wonderful books from my personal collection. What I've done is I've taken a book by an author I love, and paired it up with two more books based on what I think you would like if you're a fan of the author listed. I'm charging $15 shipped per set, and don't worry, this is all stuff from my personal collection that I know and love, I'm not shipping you any old junk! If you want an idea of what my taste is like, feel free to check my submissions and look at my previous /r/bookexchange posts. If your taste is similar to mine, you'll probably find something you like here! I am currently offering three packs from the following authors:  

Ray Bradbury  
Charles Bukowski  
Albert Camus  
Michael Chabon  
~~Philip K Dick~~  
Dave Eggers  
~~Christopher Hitchens~~  
Aldous Huxley  
Franz Kafka  
Jack Kerouac  (x2)  
Yann Martel (Let's be real... let's just call this the ""Life of Pi pack""  
Cormac McCarthy  
George Orwell  
Sylvia Plath  
JD Salinger  
David Sedaris  
John Steinbeck  
Kurt Vonnegut    

I also have a couple that I am aptly naming the ""baseball pack"" and the ""poetry pack"", one is for fans of baseball, the other for fans of poetry. I'll leave it up to you to decide which is which. If you're feeling extra adventurous, I've taken the books that don't really fit into any of these author's categories and stuck them into groups of 4, which are completely random and I'll do for $12 shipped. It's stuff I enjoy but if for some reason you don't enjoy it, you can always come back here and trade them with people who will! (The circle of book exchange life goes on!)  

I also like to throw in a random book every now and then if I have extra space in an envelope, so I'll do this as well. The first 5 orders will receive an extra free book of my choosing, unrelated to the author/subject selected in your order. Other orders may have a freebie as well but are not guaranteed.

Please remember that all of these books were read/owned by me so although a lot of them are in new/like new condition, a lot do have some wear and tear. I try my best not to sell books that are too worn or annotated but sometimes things do slip through the cracks. If you are for some reason unhappy or unsatisfied feel free to message me and we can work it out. I'm a man of the people, ya know. 

Feel free to message/comment if there's anything else you'd like to know! Keep reading!  


EDIT: Btw, all prices are shipped to continental US. I am down for international shipping as well but we'll have to discuss a fair price, be sure to let me know your country when messaging! All payments are done through paypal.    

EDIT 2: I also want to reiterate that only ONE book from the author is included in each pack. The other two books are books by different authors that I selected based on your interest in that author. This is not a 3 pack from the same author, sorry for any confusion!",,False,,t5_2rl8w,1365448775.0,,us,True,t3_1bwin8,http://www.reddit.com/r/bookexchange/comments/1bwin8/my_reddit_book_sale_is_back_with_a_twist/,

I got a good response last time.  Mailed to 9 people and heard back from 8 of them.  Please let me know when your book arrives.  There are only these six right now so if there are more requests than I have books I apologize for not getting to everyone.

This week's book is [Sin City by Frank Miller](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin_City). This is the 2nd in my 3 part series on comic books (or graphic novels if you prefer).  Although I don't editorialize much, I would like to add that I think Frank Miller is a racist motherfucker and if you ever see him interviewed on the subject of global or economic politics you will see why I think he is an idiot and generally a piece of shit.  That said, Sin City is still a good series and I hope the winner enjoys it.

As usual, I'm going to take names in comments and then hold a random drawing to determine the winner.  The cutoff to be included in the raffle will be Midnightish PST on Sunday, **June 3rd**.  I will ship the book for free to anybody in the United States.  International Redditors are welcome to participate, but I'll ask you to cover shipping.  I plan on doing this until I run out of books or money, so if you win a book from me you won't be eligible again for 99 years.  Also, please **don't enter with throwaway accounts**.  There is a 99.9% chance you won't log back in with the throwaway, which means you won't see my attempts to contact you should you win.  Good luck to all those who participate, and I will update this post to announce a winner.

**UPDATE: The winner is [Batgasm](/u/Batgasm).**

As usual, I'm going to take names in comments and then hold a random drawing to determine the winner.  The cutoff to be included in the raffle will be Midnightish PST on Sunday, **October 14th**.  I will ship the book for free to anybody in the United States.  International Redditors are welcome to participate, but I'll ask you to cover shipping.  I plan on doing this until I run out of books or money, so if you win a book from me you won't be eligible again for 99 years.  Also, please **don't enter with throwaway accounts**.  There is a 99.9% chance you won't log back in with the throwaway, which means you won't see my attempts to contact you should you win.  Good luck to all those who participate, and I will update this post to announce a winner.

**UPDATE: The winner is [Pudie](/u/pudie).**

First we begin with a thank you for your precious feedback and reaction to the ongoing  changes.

Secondly, we would like to apologized for the inconvenience it may caused for our dear users.

We would like you to know how the changes in here works.

Each or twice a week we are rolling out a specific changes that will directly affect the site (background, CSS, etc). We wait for a week to know if how the community reacts on this change. If it is good, we will retain it. But if it is bad, we will figure it out on which part needs to change. Rest assured, we are constantly monitoring the community's reaction on this matter and meticolously   taking note every constructive criticism you may have. We encouraged you to give a strong criticism as possible so we can give you the best possible book exchange experience in the internet. When the reaction is mixed, it is in our discretion to decide to retain it or not.

I am glad that people (I mean the active 2%) are participating during weekend. We have a low traffic during this time of the week. We thought that people here have a good personal life, they use the site during weekdays and take the weekend off to read the books they got here and enjoy the personal touch. (*This is a personal observation: People who love to read books have a happy family life, they are good neighbors, and well-mannered people*)

As the title says, we have a lots of changes coming up BUT we can not itemized it here so stay tune!

I'm willing to send random stock at VERY cheap prices. I'll send a mailer (3 books) for 10 bucks shipped or a box (at least 5 books) for 20 bucks. That includes shipping!  

I know what you're thinking, ""oh look at this bozo trying to ship us random crap!"" That's not the case! Well, it is going to be random crap, but it's quality random crap! I've included a link that has listed about 90% of what I actually have, and what you receive will be from this list! You can make suggestions but the final decision is up to me. If you're interested, shoot me a message!   

(This deal is available to continental US only. If you are interested and outside of the US, I ask that you cover all shipping charges. Paypal is my method of payment.)  

Also, I just launched the 2nd free book of the week, be sure to go take a look at that!

Giveaway inside!,22,6,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/bookexchange/comments/10sdsp/my_reddit_bookstore_volume_2_giveaway_inside/,"Hey r/bookexchange users, My name is springbroke and I'm a young man on a mission. I'm looking to make a little extra income and make a little extra space in my apartment, so I come to you with (week 2!) of an idea. I want to run a used bookstore through reddit. I don't know about you, but I'm not entirely crazy about online shopping for books, records, or anything that shows some sort of expression of what your personality is like. I'll admit, purchasing through amazon is very easy and convenient, but it's just not the same as walking through a used book store, smelling the scent of old books, and talking likes/dislikes with employees and other customers. That's why I want to try to bring this experience to the online community. I intend on personalizing each order (with ways I like to keep secret, for now!) and helping bring the buyer and seller a little closer, whilst also maintaining cheap prices! I messaged the moderators and they were gracious enough to let me post here, and if this picks up some steam I'll probably post here once a week for a couple of weeks, and then try to move to my own subreddit or something.  
  I want to give a big thank you to everyone who supported me in week one, I made some sales, got some interesting ideas, and the overall reception was fantastic. It made me very excited for the future of this. I hope I can continue to provide a fun, interesting service!    
  **CONTESTS**  
I plan on doing a lot of contests and giveaways, sometimes they'll be on certain days, sometimes they'll be completely at random. Some may have a theme, some may not! This weeks contest, since this is hopefully the beginning of a fun, interesting career as a book seller, I figure why not talk about the beginning of my career as a book reader? To enter, all you have to do is tell me about the book that got you into reading, and the emotions it evoked. I want to know what made you the reader you are today. The prize this week is one of the first novels I ever read, *The Giver* by Lois Lowry. Just comment with your answer to be entered! Winners will be selected next Monday and notified promptly.  
  
  As for the actual books for sale, here is what I am offering this week. I intend on posting around 20-25 books per week, as to keep everything fresh and interesting. Keep in mind that these books are used, so they may have a little wear, but I've tried to ""grade"" these books based on condition (A being like new, F being very poor condition) and will list why it received the grade. If the book is a first edition, I will put a (1E) next to it as well. All books are paperback unless otherwise noted. Pictures are available upon request!

This week's book is a paperback copy of [Climbing Mount Improbable by Richard Dawkins](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climbing_Mount_Improbable).  

As usual, I'm going to take names in comments and then hold a random drawing to determine the winner.  The cutoff to be included in the raffle will be Midnightish PST on Sunday, **October 1st**.  I will ship the book for free to anybody in the United States.  International Redditors are welcome to participate, but I'll ask you to cover shipping.  I plan on doing this until I run out of books or money, so if you win a book from me you won't be eligible again for 99 years.  Also, please **don't enter with throwaway accounts**.  There is a 99.9% chance you won't log back in with the throwaway, which means you won't see my attempts to contact you should you win.  Good luck to all those who participate, and I will update this post to announce a winner.

**UPDATE: The winner is [elduderino260](/u/elduderino260).**

The war theme of the last two weeks presses on, and this week's book is a paperpack copy of [Catch 22 by Joseph Heller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catch_22).  

As usual, I'm going to take names in comments and then hold a random drawing to determine the winner.  The cutoff to be included in the raffle will be Midnightish PST on Sunday, **April 22nd**.  I will ship the book for free to anybody in the United States.  International Redditors are welcome to participate, but I'll ask you to cover shipping.  I plan on doing this until I run out of books or money, so if you win a book from me you won't be eligible again for 99 years.  Good luck to all those who participate, and I will update this post to announce a winner.

I used it in my 12th grade English class for my 'non-fiction text', I've lent it to at least a dozen people across north america, I've read it at least 5 times, and now its time for the rest of the world to read it.

I know a lot of r/bookexchange would like to read this book so I've decided to randomly pick someone from this post and mail it to them **AS LONG AS** they mail it to someone else that wants it when they're done.

I want all of r/bookexchange to read it by the end of 2012, I hope my book gets passed around between so many people its not in one piece when it comes back to me.. I WANT THIS BOOK READ.

As I no longer have a use for it, I've determined its getting shipped off tomorrow afternoon. Leave a comment here if you want the book. You can even leave a story, I'm always eager to hear about why people want to read it.

But please, If I choose to send you my book, I want you to:

A) Take good care of it

B) **DO NOT** defile the text in any way, others still need to read it

C) **PROMISE** to mail it to someone else, free of charge

D) Sign the inside of a cover! Sign it small, give others room to sign it.. When I get this book back I want to see it riddled with signatures from around the world! Sign it with your real name and/or your Reddit name!

E) And finally, Don't be a dick with others signatures. If someone else signs the book, leave their signature alone, don't vandalize it, don't scribble on it, don't leave a stupid immature note that says ""______ Has a small penis HUR HUR HUR"". 

I want this book to be shared amongst a community, not tossed around and abused by a bunch of dicks.

Don't make me regret giving away this book, Reddit! I want others to enjoy it as much as I have!

I will ship the book for free to anybody in the United States.  International Redditors are welcome to participate, but I'll ask you to cover shipping.  I plan on doing this until I run out of books or money, so if you win a book from me you won't be eligible again for 99 years.  Also, please **don't enter with throwaway accounts**.  There is a 99.9% chance you won't log back in with the throwaway, which means you won't see my attempts to contact you should you win.  Good luck to all those who participate, and I will update this post to announce a winner.

http://www.reddit.com/r/bookexchange/comments/ter3d/contest_announcement/

I have put together a list of books for you all to vote on.  

Currently the top four based on upvote are: 

* A Song of Ice and Fire 

* Anything by Vonnegut 

* Night Angel Trilogy 

* Ender's Game

Please make your choice based on the book you would like to win.  In case of Vonnegut, name the book title you would prefer to win.  Monday morning I will announce the topic for the story you need to write, to win this contest.

**UPDATE**
Somebody down voted this?

Any-who it looks like book for this week is going to be Ender's Game and by a long margin.

I will start a new thread after I get off work tonight detailing the story I want written for the contest. I would like to thank everyone for making their suggestions. Ender's Game is not a book I am familiar with, but I am looking forward to reading it now.

This week I'm giving away a hardcover set of the [His Dark Materials Trilogy by Philip Pullman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/His_dark_materials).  This includes a first US edition of The Golden Compass plus later printings (though matching cover styles) of The Subtle Knife and The Amber Spyglass.  Coincidentally this coming Sunday lands on Christmas. While I'm not a Christian, I suppose some of you might be...so if you would like to think of this as a Christmas gift from me, feel free.

As usual, I'm going to take names in comments and then hold a random drawing to determine the winner.  The cutoff to be included in the raffle will be Midnightish PST on Sunday, **December 25th**.  I will ship the book for free to anybody in the United States.  International Redditors are welcome to participate, but I'll ask you to cover shipping.  I plan on doing this until I run out of books or money, so if you win a book from me you won't be eligible again for 99 years.  Good luck to all those who participate, and I will update this post to announce a winner.

Books and mentioned to someone about how I used to have a ton of books but they were all ""lost in the divorce"".

I'm gonna copy and paste my comment so I don't have to type it again:

&gt;I used to have 2 book shelves full of books and like 5 crates of vinyl (which included at least 3 full discographies including, but not limited to, The Velvet Underground/Lou Reed, Pixies, Joy Division, NYD, and almost every riot grrrl record I could get my hands on) that I had narrowed down to solely the ""gems"" over about 10 years (I'm 24). I had collected from all over the US. I had stuff from shops in Minnesota, Kansas, California (went to City Lights and met Ferlinghetti), NY, etc. Wherever I, or anybody I loved, went, they'd bring me back a book or a record with a sticker from the shop.

&gt;When I kicked out my shitty ex and his parents came to help him get his stuff, I came home to find all my vinyl and books had been taken.

&gt;It seemed worth it at the time, just to have him gone and out of my life, but it's going to take me years to build up that collection again because I get so sad when I go book/vinyl hunting and see things I used to have, but don't anymore. feelsbadman :(

There was another one I had that I had signed by the author and is now out print and he told me he is not planning on printing any more :(

&gt;I also had some first edition Kurt Vonnegut books, including a signed, numbered copy of Galapagos (#/500). And an edition of Catcher in the Rye that was worth ~$500.

&gt;I'm good at finding things of value and hiding that fact from the people at the junk shops so I can pay $2 for them.


I don't want to outright *ask* people for free books, and I would gladly do an exchange, if I had anything to exchange...
But I thought it might be worth it to see if there was anyone out there who would take pity on me ;_;

If you have a spare copy of *Nova Express* that is just gathering dust, or an old dusty *Notes of a Dirty Old Man* that your dog maybe chewed on the corner of, an abundance of Hunter Thompson paperbacks or you just found that copy of *Hollywood Babylon* you thought you'd lost so you bought another one...

I took a few weeks off because I was out of town for a bit and had to do some working to get caught back up! This week we're doing something different. I didn't really have a chance to grab some new stuff this week, so I'm doing something new that I hope you'll enjoy. This week I'm doing a PAY-WHAT-YOU-WANT sale. I'm going to list some books, and you're more than welcome to pay whatever price you want for them. I'm just looking to make sure they go to happy homes and get the care they deserve, because they're all either books I've read or books I will never get around to reading. Here's how it works: You message me and tell me what you want and where you're located, and I'll respond with your shipping price and paypal address. You can pay whatever you want for the actual book, but you MUST cover shipping and handling. I think that's a pretty fair deal! Also, one other rule. The limit on books per person is two. I'm implementing that rule so everyone has a fair shot to get something they want. I'm sure you understand! If you have any questions, feel free to message me.
 
  
  As for the books for sale, here is what I am offering this week. I intend on posting around 20-25 books per week, as to keep everything fresh and interesting. Keep in mind that these books are used, so they may have a little wear, but I've tried to ""grade"" these books based on condition (A being like new, F being very poor condition) and will list why it received the grade. If the book is a first edition, I will put a (1E) next to it as well. I will also be throwing in some books with a couple random orders. All books are paperback unless otherwise noted. Pictures are available upon request!

I'm out of ""Why Evolution is True"" but I do have quite a few copies of ""The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution"" by Richard Dawkins.

I'd like to do my part to help spread some educational material around.  It's a great overall introduction to evolution. I would prefer to send these to someone who doesn't know much about the issue and would like to understand more, so if you already have a good grasp on the science or if you've already read the book, please don't request one.  Just make a post here or send me a PM if you're interested.

And for those who get a copy, all I ask in return is that you please donate it to someone else or to your local library (or used bookstore) when you're finished with it.  Obviously I'm going by the honor system here but I trust you guys. :)

You can tell me what you want written in the front of the book. In return it would be great if you could sit down with your kid and draw a funny animal maybe a sloth or platypus and send it to the return address with the envelope addressed to Kaela. Kaela is a friend who is feeling sad because of some recent events, I think it would really make her happy again if she got some funny pictures of animals in the mail. 

First choose a book you would like from my website www.beausbooks.com

Send me a message by reddit telling me which one you would like and tell me who I should make the inscription to. Also tell me where I should send the book (sorry I can only ship inside USA). Assuming USPS is still in business you will get your free book sometime in the near future. I only have about forty books at my house so I guess I am obligated to say, while supplies last. Sorry.

Once you have read the book with your child and you have some free time sit down with your child and support them while they draw a picture of any animal, the funnier the better. Put picture in envelope write ""To Kaela"" on the front and send it to the return address on the package the book came in. Give your kid a high five and a smile. 

And thanks, I think if this works Kaela will recapture some of those smiles that seem to have run away. :-)

I will ship the book for free to anybody in the United States.  International Redditors are welcome to participate, but I'll ask you to cover shipping.  I plan on doing this until I run out of books or money, so if you win a book from me you won't be eligible again for 99 years.  Also, please **don't enter with throwaway accounts**.  There is a 99.9% chance you won't log back in with the throwaway, which means you won't see my attempts to contact you should you win.  Good luck to all those who participate, and I will update this post to announce a winner.

This week's book is a paperback copy of [A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man by James Joyce](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Portrait_of_the_Artist_as_a_Young_Man).  

As usual, I'm going to take names in comments and then hold a random drawing to determine the winner.  The cutoff to be included in the raffle will be Midnightish PST on Sunday, **October 7th**.  I will ship the book for free to anybody in the United States.  International Redditors are welcome to participate, but I'll ask you to cover shipping.  I plan on doing this until I run out of books or money, so if you win a book from me you won't be eligible again for 99 years.  Also, please **don't enter with throwaway accounts**.  There is a 99.9% chance you won't log back in with the throwaway, which means you won't see my attempts to contact you should you win.  Good luck to all those who participate, and I will update this post to announce a winner.

**UPDATE: The winner is [psychomar](/u/psychomar).**

As usual, I'm going to take names in comments and then hold a random drawing to determine the winner.  The cutoff to be included in the raffle will be Midnightish PST on Sunday, **July 8th**.  I will ship the book for free to anybody in the United States.  International Redditors are welcome to participate, but I'll ask you to cover shipping.  I plan on doing this until I run out of books or money, so if you win a book from me you won't be eligible again for 99 years.  Also, please **don't enter with throwaway accounts**.  There is a 99.9% chance you won't log back in with the throwaway, which means you won't see my attempts to contact you should you win.  Good luck to all those who participate, and I will update this post to announce a winner.

**UPDATE: The winner is [moonkiller](/u/moonkiller).**

I'm not to familiar with adult fiction but again I am open to suggestions. This is a very large list of books that I have enjoyed for long enough and they need a new home as much as I need some new reading material.

This week's book will be a paperback copy of [Fight Club by Chuck Palahniuk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fight_Club_%28novel%29).  As usual, I'm going to take names in comments and then hold a random drawing to determine the winner.  This time, however, I'd like to ask you folks to suggest books for future giveaways with your entries.  I can't promise I'll get those books, but I'll try.  The cutoff to be included in the drawing will be Midnightish PST on Sunday, November 20th.  I will ship the book for free to anybody in the United States.  I plan on doing this until I run out of books or money, so if you win a book from me you won't be eligible again for 99 years.  Good luck to all those who participate, and I will update this post to announce a winner.

1350927118.0,12,self.bookexchange,11wkrk,[THANKS] to the entirety of this subreddit! No Sale This Week... but Giveaways galore!,16,4,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/bookexchange/comments/11wkrk/thanks_to_the_entirety_of_this_subreddit_no_sale/,"Hey all, for those who haven't caught my posts every Monday for the past month or so, I've been doing running book sales and I've LOVED the response I've gotten. I've been writing customers letters with each order and I've gotten messages back, letters received, even postcards with drawn-on karma! Unfortunately, I won't be having a sale this week. I'm leaving on Wednesday to go to a music festival in Florida and won't be back for a week, and there's no way I'd be able to keep up with orders from the road. What I can do, however, is thank everyone in this subreddit with a few cool giveaways, both inside AND outside of the reddit.   
**GIVEAWAY #1**  
For this first giveaway, it's pretty simple. I'm headed to a music festival, and I'm hoping to have a great time. So, to be entered to win a prize this week, tell me about a concert/festival experience you've had, and go HEAVY on the details. Pretend you're a writer for a big music magazine, and you've been selected to write a ""concert review"" on a concert you've attended. I've got a few music-related books available for prizes, so let's hear your stories!  
**GIVEAWAY #2**  
Okay, this one is going to be fun and very interactive. I'll be headed up and down the east coast from Pennsylvania to New York to Florida, and everywhere in between for the next week. I plan on taking a few books with me and leaving them in hidden locations along the way. I will post in this thread as I do, so you HAVE to keep checking back if you live around these areas. I won't tell what any of the books are but I will be pretty specific about locations  so you're not hunting around looking like a doofus in what will probably be a very public location. If you do find one of the books, PLEASE message me and let me know. I want to know that they've been found! And if you don't like what you find, you know you could always come back to /r/bookexchange and trade it for something you will like!    

I hope you guys all participate and have fun, this is just a little way to give back to everyone who has helped make my Mondays much more enjoyable. Thanks again, book-exchangers!  

EDIT: So, I'm a knucklehead and forgot to pack books, so giveaway #2 is changing. I'm going to document the places I stop and if you live in one of those areas, I'll send you a book. I know it's not as fun as a scavenger hunt, but this is what happens when you forget to make a to-do list!

I'm looking to make a little extra income and make a little extra space in my apartment, so I come to you with (week 2!) of an idea. I want to run a used bookstore through reddit. I don't know about you, but I'm not entirely crazy about online shopping for books, records, or anything that shows some sort of expression of what your personality is like. I'll admit, purchasing through amazon is very easy and convenient, but it's just not the same as walking through a used book store, smelling the scent of old books, and talking likes/dislikes with employees and other customers. That's why I want to try to bring this experience to the online community. I intend on personalizing each order and helping bring the buyer and seller a little closer, whilst also maintaining cheap prices! I messaged the moderators and they were gracious enough to let me post here, and if this picks up some steam I'll probably post here once a week for a couple of weeks, and then try to move to my own subreddit or something.   
  Next week I'll be out of town for a bit so I'm going to do a few extra books listed this week, including some that were listed before at a new, cheaper price. Be sure to take advantage while they're listed!
  **CONTESTS**  
I plan on doing a lot of contests and giveaways, sometimes they'll be on certain days, sometimes they'll be completely at random. Some may have a theme, some may not! This week, I want to talk non-fiction. For the most part, I've been stocking my sales with a lot of novels, and I'm wanting to expand a bit more into non-fiction, but I don't know what people are interested in. Personally, I love reading about baseball, be it a biography, an analysis of a certain aspect of the game, or just a history of the game. So you can help me better my non-fiction section, all you have to do is tell me the type of non-fiction that you love to read about!  The winner will receive a copy of ""Common Sense, Rights Of Man, And Other Essentials Writings"" by Thomas Paine. Just comment with your answer to be entered! Winners will be selected next Monday and notified promptly. No purchase necessary to win!  
  
  As for the actual books for sale, here is what I am offering this week. I intend on posting around 20-25 books per week, as to keep everything fresh and interesting. Keep in mind that these books are used, so they may have a little wear, but I've tried to ""grade"" these books based on condition (A being like new, F being very poor condition) and will list why it received the grade. If the book is a first edition, I will put a (1E) next to it as well. I will also be throwing in some books with a couple random orders. All books are paperback unless otherwise noted. Pictures are available upon request!

As usual, I'm going to take names in comments and then hold a random drawing to determine the winner.  The cutoff to be included in the raffle will be Midnightish PST on Sunday, **August 19th**.  I will ship the book for free to anybody in the United States.  International Redditors are welcome to participate, but I'll ask you to cover shipping.  I plan on doing this until I run out of books or money, so if you win a book from me you won't be eligible again for 99 years.  Also, please **don't enter with throwaway accounts**.  There is a 99.9% chance you won't log back in with the throwaway, which means you won't see my attempts to contact you should you win.  Good luck to all those who participate, and I will update this post to announce a winner.

Here's some songs I've covered/a few I've written: http://www.youtube.com/user/MediumTealBlue/videos -- The ones by Seen/Saw are me.

This week's book is a paperback copy of [To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_Kill_a_Mockingbird).

As usual, I'm going to take names in comments and then hold a random drawing to determine the winner.  The cutoff to be included in the raffle will be Midnightish PST on Sunday, **June 17th**.  I will ship the book for free to anybody in the United States.  International Redditors are welcome to participate, but I'll ask you to cover shipping.  I plan on doing this until I run out of books or money, so if you win a book from me you won't be eligible again for 99 years.  Also, please **don't enter with throwaway accounts**.  There is a 99.9% chance you won't log back in with the throwaway, which means you won't see my attempts to contact you should you win.  Good luck to all those who participate, and I will update this post to announce a winner.

**UPDATE: The winner is [s4g1774r1us](/u/s4g1774r1us).**

This week's book is a paperback copy of [The Importance of Being Earnest by Oscar Wilde](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Importance_of_Being_Earnest).  For those of you in San Francisco, there is an interesting exhibition called [The Cult of Beauty](http://legionofhonor.famsf.org/legion/exhibitions/cult-beauty-victorian-avant-garde-1860-1900) at the Legion of Honor on the [artistic movement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aestheticism) of which Wilde was a part.

As usual, I'm going to take names in comments and then hold a random drawing to determine the winner.  The cutoff to be included in the raffle will be Midnightish PST on Sunday, **February 26th**.  I will ship the book for free to anybody in the United States.  International Redditors are welcome to participate, but I'll ask you to cover shipping.  I plan on doing this until I run out of books or money, so if you win a book from me you won't be eligible again for 99 years.  Good luck to all those who participate, and I will update this post to announce a winner.

**UPDATE: The winner is [MightyHero](http://www.reddit.com/user/MightyHero).**

That isn't my goal in the slightest.  These books are from some relatives of mine who are moving in a few months.  What I'd love to do is for the people who are interested in these books pick two books you want me to send and then send me back one in return. 

The husband reads westerns (Louis L'amour) and the wife reads historical chick-lit-ish books and I read all kinds of non-fiction (biology, ecology, psychology, history, computer science, poetry, books in Spanish, you name it).  You don't necessarily have to trade back one western if you receive two.  You could always send a chick-lit-ish type book or a non-fiction in return.  Please feel free to surprise us. 

* Here is what I have from the wife:
* Christmas in Plains by Jimmy Carter
* Eat Pray Love by Elizabeth Gilbert
* In the Company of Others by Jan Karon
* Hidden Summit by Robyn Carr
* Secondhand Bride by Linda Lael Miller
* Off Season by Anne Rivers Siddons
* The Girls They Left Behind by Lillian Harry
* The Cat who Tailed a Thief by Lilian Jackson Braun


From the Husband:
* The Barons of Texas by Jory Sherman
* The Lone War Cry by George Miller
* . . . plus a pile of nearly 100 Louis L'amour westerns--I won't even attempt to list them, but if you want some of them then just let me know how many and I'll see what I can do.

Sorry I've been wishy-washy lately, It's been a wild month or so for me and I'm trying to balance everything out. I have a second job that requires me to travel quite a bit, and for that reason, this will be my last post for 2012. I'll be leaving next Tuesday, December 4. So if you want something from this post, please get your order in to me by Monday, December 3! That way I can ship everything out at once before I go.   

For this sale, I've decided to continue with the Pay-What-You-Want format. So long as shipping is covered, you can pay whatever price you want for the books. I think it went pretty well and everyone seemed satisfied. Any money made from this will go towards getting my friends and family a few last-minute christmas presents, and if anything is left over I may try to do a New Year's giveaway on here... but only time will tell! Here's how it works: You message me and tell me what you want and where you're located, and I'll respond with your shipping price and paypal address. You can pay whatever you want for the actual book, but you MUST cover shipping and handling. I think that's a pretty fair deal! Also, one other rule. The limit on books per person is three. I'm implementing that rule so everyone has a fair shot to get something they want. After a couple days from the post date, the rule will be removed and everything will be fair game. I'm sure you understand! If you have any questions, feel free to message me.   

For this post, I've pulled some old books, some new books, and some books from my personal collection, so hopefully I have something for everyone here. Keep in mind that these books are used, so they may have a little wear, but I've tried to ""grade"" these books based on condition (A being like new, F being very poor condition) and will list why it received the grade. If the book is a first edition, I will put a (1E) next to it as well. I will also be throwing in some books with a couple random orders. All books are paperback unless otherwise noted. Pictures are available upon request!

Please share your opinion.  ,11,2,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/bookexchange/comments/12f9il/suggestionrequest_for_helping_find_books_please/,"This is a suggestion that would help me find specific books people are looking for.  Maybe it is something that would help others too.

I go to a thrift shop near me at least once a week and look through the couple thousand books they have.  I see a lot of things that don't particularly interest me but that I think might interest others.  I see a lot of popular titles and see things that are several decades old to stuff that is probably still on a bestseller list.  

My trouble comes with trying to figure out what to keep an eye out for when I go looking.  I don't get a whole lot of time to spend on the internet so making things more concise would be a great benefit.  My idea is that there could be a list where each person looking for particular books submits their top three or so and it is has a uniform format.  This would allow anyone who might go to thrift stores like myself or book fairs to quickly see what titles others are looking for.  A simple list would be easy for those with internet on their phones to pull up and check while they're browsing bookshelves.  

This isn't an attempt to eliminate individual posts.  Those are obviously necessary in terms of people looking to pass on books and have more detailed discussions about what they are or aren't looking for.  (ie. Someone who is looking for ""any science fiction books"" can have space to elaborate what they mean by that, and others can respond with ""I have X book, are you interested?"".  

One of my initial concerns was that there might be trouble having to constantly update this list.  When I clicked on the New tab in this subreddit I noticed the first page of 25 posts were at most 9 days old.  I don't know if that is very active with 6,000+ subscribers.  It might be possible that many have made requests in the past and became discouraged.  Either way I don't see it being something that would need to be monitored and updated daily.  This is just an idea I wanted to present to see if it could help more people find what they're looking for.

Unfortunately this is also a bit of a selfish request.  I can only volunteer so much for such a project.  As it stands I'm quite busy with work and don't want to commit to something that I might have little time to support.  

tl/dr : List of community book requests to better match readers with the books they're looking for.

So this week's book will be a paperback copy of [No Exit and Three Other Plays by Jean-Paul Sartre](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Exit).  As usual, I'm going to take names in comments and then hold a random drawing to determine the winner.  The cutoff to be included in the drawing will be Midnightish PST on Sunday, November 13th.  I will ship the book for free to anybody in the United States.  I plan on doing this until I run out of books or money, so if you win a book from me you won't be eligible again for 99 years.  Good luck to all those who participate, and I will update this post to announce a winner.

I will ship the book for free to anybody in the United States.  I plan on doing this until I run out of books or money, so if you win a book from me you won't be eligible again for 99 years.  Good luck to all those who participate, and I will update this post to announce a winner.

This copy has been read twice in my possession, once by me and once by my friend. I did buy it from a used book store, so I do not know how others have treated it, but it has remained on my shelf for a while. Published some time after February 2004.

I accept Paypal, but I can't ship outside of the U.S. I also wouldn't mind shipping in bulk (preferably 20+lbs, let me know if you're interested).

I will ship the book for free to anybody in the United States.  International Redditors are welcome to participate, but I'll ask you to cover shipping.  I plan on doing this until I run out of books or money, so if you win a book from me you won't be eligible again for 99 years.  Good luck to all those who participate, and I will update this post to announce a winner.

This week's book is [Walden and Civil Disobedience by Henry David Thoreau](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walden).  If you've been watching the news lately you've seen people being encouraged to camp out at Walmart for deals on consumer electronics, while people camping out to protest government corruption have been met with disproportionate force at the hands of the police.  At the same time that US students and citizens have been pepper-sprayed by the police for nonviolent protest, US shoppers have been pepper-spraying each other to get deals on video games.  I feel that both [Walden](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walden) and [Civil Disobedience](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Disobedience_%28Thoreau%29) are particularly poignant for our country right now...the former as a treatise on simple living that we can use during this season of consumerism, the latter as a pillar to give us strength as we resist an unjust economic order. 

As usual, I'm going to take names in comments and then hold a random drawing to determine the winner.  The cutoff to be included in the drawing will be Midnightish PST on Sunday, **December 4th**.  I will ship the book for free to anybody in the United States.  I plan on doing this until I run out of books or money, so if you win a book from me you won't be eligible again for 99 years.  Good luck to all those who participate, and I will update this post to announce a winner.

So 1: I bought a bunch and am slowly trying to read and then give them to people who want them. I'll make a list at the end. I figured after I'm done reading them I'm more than happy to exchange for whatever offers you guys want. (Admittedly it might take me a while to read them. I don't want to speed read obviously. So this is more for if you are in no rush for a book) 2: If anyone has been dying to get a book but can't find/afford just put a request in here. I'll keep my eyes out when I go to the store. They have a shit ton of the usuals like Michael Chrichton, Koontz, Terry Brooks, that other fantasy Terry. I saw like 6 Water for Elephants. They have a huge non fiction section. You can request a non fiction but it's super unorganized and hard for me to find but I'd be happy to look for you guys. I'll probably make a post like this once a week just so you guys can put down some requests and I can update my reading list. Again, the ones I have and am reading will probably take a while because I have books on Kindle I want to get through as well. Sorry if this came out terrible but I thought I'd offer my services. I mean come on...a dollar a book! With specials pretty frequently where they are 50 cents. So if this was stupid just let me know. No hard feelings.

* The Wind Through the Keyhole
* The Gunslinger
* Nightshift
* ~~Under the Dome~~ (Read)

I'm looking for some books to complete my series. I'm missing the Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (doesn't matter what kind of cover), also if anyone has the third book in the Genghis Khan historical fiction trilogy by Conn Iggulden.

I've always been drawn to very particular books (certain types of pages, the print layout, the feel, the smell, shape, etc.) and over the summer I stayed in a cabin where I encountered a 1971 hardcover copy of Fear and Loathing. I'd never read it but it had always be on my ""list"" so I picked it up and got about a third in before we had to leave.




I particularly loved this edition of the book and I considered just keeping it but decided instead to just copy down the info and look it up online when I returned home. Turns out it's kind of an expensive collectible - I haven't found it anywhere for less than $250!

I don't know how to prove that I'm not looking to make money off of it. I had even mentioned to my boyfriend's family how much I loved the book while we were on vacation before I knew it was worth anything. I've also considered calling the woman who owned the cabin to ask if I could buy her copy.



So, if anyone happens to have a copy that they're willing to part with, I'll take it! I don't care very much about condition as long as it's readable. And if you're able to do this I guess I could pretty much just buy you a new copy of any book you're interested in.",,False,,t5_2rl8w,1355199938.0,,,True,t3_14nbw1,http://www.reddit.com/r/bookexchange/comments/14nbw1/want_a_certain_copy_of_fear_and_loathing_in_las/,

As usual, I'm going to take names in comments and then hold a random drawing to determine the winner.  The cutoff to be included in the raffle will be Midnightish PST on Sunday, **October 21st**.  I will ship the book for free to anybody in the United States.  International Redditors are welcome to participate, but I'll ask you to cover shipping.  I plan on doing this until I run out of books or money, so if you win a book from me you won't be eligible again for 99 years.  Also, please **don't enter with throwaway accounts**.  There is a 99.9% chance you won't log back in with the throwaway, which means you won't see my attempts to contact you should you win.  Good luck to all those who participate, and I will update this post to announce a winner.

* Aquinas, *Summa Theologica*:    
This is the complete five volume set in a beautiful blue clothcover translated by the English Dominicans. It's $154 on [Amazon right now](http://www.amazon.com/Summa-Theologica-Thomas-Aquinas-Volumes/dp/0870610635). My set is in fantastic condition - I can take pictures and send them to anyone interested. This is a special set, so I'd ask for something special in return.    
* Augustine, *Eighty-Three Different Questions*:    
This is a paperback in great condition - volume 70 of The Fathers of the Church series.    
* Augustine, *Letters*:    
I have the [complete set](http://www.newcitypress.com/letters-4-volume-set.html) (four volumes) of Augustine's letters. It's currently worth about $140. These are often more pastoral than theological or philosophical, but you know how easily that line can be crossed with Augustine. The translation is new and easy to follow. I also have a collection of Augustine's writings called *Arianism and Other Heresies* from the same publication series that I can include in this set. It's also a nice clothbound edition, and looks exactly the same as the other four. Again, this set is fairly special and I'd ask for something special in return.    
* Augustine, *On Christian Teaching*:    
Oxford World Classics paperback in great condition.    
* Augustine, *On Genesis*:    
This is a paperback in great condition - volume 84 of The Fathers of the Church series. It contains *Two Books on Genesis against the Manichees* and *On the Literal Interpretation of Genesis: an Unfinished Book*.    
* Augustine, *The Teacher*, *The Free Choice of the Will*, and *Grace and Free Will*:    
This is a paperback in great condition - volume 59 of The Fathers of the Church series.        
* Chrysostom, *On Marriage and Family Life*:

* Cyril of Alexandria, *On the Unity of Christ*:    
Paperback, Popular Patristics Series, great condition.    
* Gregory of Tours, *Vita Patrum*:    
This is a paperback in fair condition. The binding has held, but the front cover is ripped in the corner. I'll send a picture if anyone is interested.        

**Addition - Catholic Texts, Papal Encyclicals and Similar Works (Latin titles listed, but the translations are in English)**    

* Benedict XVI: *Deus Caritas Est*, *Spe Salvi*, *Sacramentum Caritatis*, *Caritas in Veritate*    
* John Paul II: *Redemptor Hominis*, *Familiaries Consortio*, *Laborem Exercens*, *Fides et Ratio*    
* Libreria Editrice Vaticana, *Manual of Indulgences: Norms and Grants*:

Hardcover in good condition - one corner is ""smushed"". I can send a picture showing what I mean by smushed. :)    

**Addition - Catholic Texts, Hagiography**

**Addition - Catholic Texts, Popular Spirituality**

* Ferrer, *Treatise on The Spiritual Life*:    
This is a manual on the spiritual life for Dominicans. It's almost a pamphlet. Great condition.    
* Kreeft, *Prayer for Beginners*:    
An introduction to the four types of Catholic prayer. Paperback with a worn cover, but otherwise in good condition.    
* Louis of Granada, OP, *The Sinner's Guide*:

* Murray, OP, *The New Wine of Dominican Spirituality: A Drink Called Happiness*:    
The Dominicans are a religious order with an interesting history. They were in charge of the Inquisition in many places. They maintained a self of rationalism when the world deserted it. The biggest intellectual giants of the Church from the late middle ages through today have been Dominicans. This book is not about Dominican intellectualism, but about an approach to living that the order manifests. Paperback in great condition.    
* Scupoli, *The Spiritual Combat*:    
Another medieval spiritual work that influenced the ""big"" religious orders of its day, and therefore much of subsequent history. Paperback in great condition.

**Addition - Catholic Texts, Modern Theology**    

* Dulles, SJ, *Craft of Theology: From Symbol to System*:

Inspired by the recent news of the Italian captain who allegedly abandoned his sinking ship, this week's book is a paperback copy of [Lord Jim by Joseph Conrad](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Jim).  This week, I would like it if you guys could suggest books or authors you'd like to see in future giveaways.

As usual, I'm going to take names in comments and then hold a random drawing to determine the winner.  The cutoff to be included in the raffle will be Midnightish PST on Sunday, **January 29th**.  I will ship the book for free to anybody in the United States.  International Redditors are welcome to participate, but I'll ask you to cover shipping.  I plan on doing this until I run out of books or money, so if you win a book from me you won't be eligible again for 99 years.  Good luck to all those who participate, and I will update this post to announce a winner.

I am an avid reader that's looking to distribute books to low-income families locally and in neighboring areas, doing the sorting and hard work to get inspiring books in the hands of the intended readers.

I'm researching and in communication with various charity organizations in the area and trying to gather source demographics for impoverished local families.

My [Goodreads profile](http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/247727-gunner-mcgrath) also has two wishlist shelves, one for books I want in any format, and one for books I only want in hardcover. I'm willing to entertain any offer, though, especially for hardcovers I don't already own (that's another shelf on goodreads, if you want to take a look).

*Dragons of Eden* by Carl Sagan

*Beowulf* 

*Siddhartha* by Hermann Hesse

I have little to offer, but if you message me or comment, I can tell you what I have, as I'm still deciding what I would not mind parting with. 

**Edit**: Here are some of the books I have that I will give. Some are not in great condition, but are still very readable. Some of them got damaged when I moved a few years ago.

*Little Women* by Louisa May Alcott. Due to how it was stored, it is curved at the two corners, but the pages are all fine, as well as the print.

*Hatchet* by Gary Paulsen. Very good condition. Some slight fringing at the very top of the spine, but not bad. 

*Jack Fish* by J. Milligan. Like new.

*Tom Sawyer* by Mark Twain. This one took some slight water damage at the bottom, causing some slight staining. The text is all fine, though there are some stains on the lower inner corners of some pages. The string bookmark is frayed. There is a slight rip at the bottom of the book jacket. 

*Summer of the Monkeys* by Wilson Rawls. Good condition. Except for a slight bend on the back, there is almost nothing wrong with it. 

*All the Pretty Horses* by Cormac McCarthy. Very good condition. The only thing is that I needed it for an english report. Some of the top corners of pages are bent, but not badly. There are also notes inside that I took, but I can remove those with an eraser. 

I also own a lot of copies from *Goosebumps* by R.L. Stein. They may be a bit bent, though, since they've been in the attic for so long. 

I can post pictures if necessary. Also, I always write my name inside my books, so if you *do* want one, it will have my name in it. I don't write in them anymore than that. I also have many more books in my attic, so I can continue to update as I find more that you people may be interested in.

Vintage Catholic books and philosophy.,8,2,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/bookexchange/comments/vbmbh/send_crapload_of_books_that_i_either_do_not_need/,"List o' Books in no particular order:

**Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr Hyde 2nd ed.** (Stevenson) As new- no damage or signs of wear.

**Flowers for Algernon** (Keyes) Well used, but no damage to pages. Minor crease on front cover, one marker line on outside of pages, resale sticker on back cover.

**Tragedy of Mariam** (Cary) Nearly as new. One folded corner on page 4. Very interesting Renaissance closet drama.

**Jude the Obscure** (Hardy) As new. Never opened. I don't like Hardy.

**Writing About Literature, 12th ed.** (Roberts) Used, but excellent condition. This is a textbook generally used for senior English courses.

**Women Writers in Renaissance England** (Anthology) Used, but quite good. Couple folded corners.

**Mayor of Casterbridge** (Hardy) Also never opened, again because I don't like Hardy.

**The History of the Future** (Wilson) Ever so slightly dog-eared.

**A Tale of Two Cities** Unabridged (Dickens) Afaik never opened, but not the best quality paperback, so pages aren't entirely even, and one minor tear at the top of the spine.

**Crime and Punishment** (Dostoevsky) Very slightly dog-eared.

**Don Quixote** (Cervantes) Slightly dog-eared.

**Hard times** (Dickens) Book is heavily used; first page of each chapter has been folded in the corner. However the cover itself is in perfect condition. No markings inside or out.

**Reinventing the Sacred** (Kauffman) Dust jacket shows a bit of wear along the top edge, but the book itself is in pristine condition (because I didn't like it very much).

**Misquoting Jesus** (Ehrman) Like new, except for one marker line on the outside of the pages. Same boat as the last one.

The last two are hardcover, rest are paperback. I thought I also had Frankenstein lying around somewhere, but damned if I can find it. I'll update if I come across it or I'll search for it if someone really wants it. I know for sure that I'm missing at least part of my collection here, because there are a couple books I was expecting to come across and never did.

A few of these books I'm slightly hesitant to part with, so I may not be willing to entertain many offers for them. However most of them I'm eager to send to someone who might appreciate them. So if any of these interest you, let me know, and we can talk.

As I posted in my other thread in this sub, I'm on the lookout for vintage Catholic prayer books and Catholic missals published 1962 or earlier. I'm also willing to look at philosophical books (although I'm a bit picky), and anything that might be considered Catholic or Orthodox theology.

Lastly, if you do have any of those vintage Catholic missals, theological texts, or prayer books that I mentioned, I might be willing to part with some of my previously used philosophy textbooks which are:

**Buddhism as Philosophy** (Siderits)

**Elements of Moral Philosophy** (Rachels and Rachels)

**Fear and Trembling** (Kierkegaard)

**Twilight of the Idols (incl. The Antichrist and Ecce Homo)** (Nietzsche)

**Beyond Good and Evil** (Nietzsche)

**Spirit** (Hegel)

**Our Knowledge of the External World** (Russell)

**Language Truth and Logic** (Ayer)

**The Foundations of Arithmetic** (Frege)

I'm back again, listening to the Cubs game and organizing my books. The only similarity I can find between the two is that they both wear me out and fill me with unrelenting grief... but I keep coming back every day!  

This week's book sale comes with something I love, and hopefully you do as well: freebies. If you purchase a book from me before Friday, I'll toss in a free book with your order. It'll likely be a ""timeless classic"" that I always end up having way too many of, but I have a few other books that I plan on throwing in as well because they are small and will pack in nicely!

[W] You to check out my contest!,14,11,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/bookexchange/comments/1d1clh/w_to_shamelessly_self_promote_w_you_to_check_out/,"Hey all, you're probably either getting really used to or really sick of me posting my book sales all the time on here, and I don't blame you! I've been so taken aback by the amount of support and business I've received from the users of this subreddit in the past 8 months or so. I'm finally stepping my game up a bit. I've started a tumblr page and a mailing list for my book sales, so I can try to limit the amount of posts I make on here, as this is more of a trading subreddit than it is a selling subreddit. I figured there's no better time to host a contest than now. I just made an order of 200 mailers to jumpstart doing this more regularly and I'd like to use a couple on the people that helped make this possible, you guys! I'm sending 5 free books out to 5 people who follow the tumblr and join the mailing list. The tumblr page is here: http://springbrokebooks.tumblr.com/, and my email address is listed on the page. You can email me with your name, location, and authors/books you like to read, or you can do that in the tumblr ask box and include your email address. I promise not to spam you, it'll all be done manually by me so you'll likely get an email every week or so. I will also use the information provided to select books for the winners.   

I haven't been on tumblr in a while so I don't really know the ropes, I'm not going to say that people who give me a little shoutout post on tumblr will be more likely to win, but I'm also not saying that *wink wink* ;). But seriously, it'll be totally random, so don't kiss my butt too hard!  

For those of you not on tumblr, you can join the mailing list and just post in the email that you're not a tumblr user and I'll throw your name in the hat as well. I don't have a personal tumblr so I won't blame you for not having one either.   

I plan on making this tumblr page a lot of fun. It won't just be a store, it'll be a place for people to share book suggestions, show off recent finds of their own, and generally discuss books/reading as a whole. I'll also have plenty of contests and sales through the page. I'm just a guy trying to bring good books to good people at good prices. Serious readers are a dying breed so we gotta stick together!

tl;dr help me get my dream business off the ground, win a book!  

Thanks a million and KEEP READING!

I also have a few books about Bob Dylan. I think I have 3. I'll set all 3 for $10. I also have two hardcover copies of Shel Silverstein's ""Where The Sidewalk Ends"", but neither have dust jackets. I'll take offers on them.  

Please remember that all of these books were read/owned by me so although a lot of them are in new/like new condition, a lot do have some wear and tear. I try my best not to sell books that are too worn or annotated but sometimes things do slip through the cracks. If you are for some reason unhappy or unsatisfied feel free to message me and we can work it out. I am just a dude sending books online but that gives me all the more reason to be concerned with customer service so I do the best I can to make everyone happy. This community has always treated me incredibly well so I try to do the same.  

I do all sales through paypal, (well, most of them. I've let /u/Ludwiglobster send me a nicely concealed envelope a few times) and when you message me, please let me know your location! If you're in Canada, Mexico, Australia, Mordor, or The Moon, I need to know so I can calculate shipping beforehand! (This doesn't mean I won't ship to hobbits, moonmen, or australians, it just makes my job easier!)  

Seriously though, thanks for reading, not just this post, but books in general. There's so many wonderful people writing so many wonderful things and it's hard to take the time to appreciate all of them. Happy spring, everyone.
