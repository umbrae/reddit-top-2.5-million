You do not know who I am, but I know you. I am one of the three demons that were assigned to you at birth. You see, some people in this world are destined for greatness, destined to live happy, fulfilling lives. You, I am afraid, are not one of those people, and it is our job to make sure of that. 

Who are we? Oh yes, of course, how rude of me. Allow me to introduce us:

*Shame* is my younger brother, the demon on your left shoulder. Shame tells you that you’re a freak; that those thought you have are not normal; that you will never fit in. Shame whispered into your ear when your mother found you playing with yourself as a child. Shame is the one who makes you hate yourself.                                            
*Fear* sits on your right shoulder. He is my older brother, as old as life itself. Fear fills every dark corner with monsters, turns every stranger on a dark street into a murderer. Fear stops you from telling your crush how you feel. He tells you it is better not to try than let people see you fail. Fear makes you build your own prison.

Who am I, then? I am the worst of your demons, but you see me as a friend. You turn to me when you have nothing else, because I live in your heart. I am the one who forces you to endure. The one who prolongs your torment.

Sincerely,

*Hope.*

He goes to bed at ten, every night. He says goodbye to his friends on the Internet and shuts his laptop down, like clockwork, and then he changes out of his clothes and goes to bed. He dreams, but never remembers what about. When he wakes up in the morning, he's always slept in, and he hurries to get to school in time. He gets home at thirty six minutes past three and does his homework, and then he returns to his laptop until bed. He likes gummy bears, horror films and music that has screamed vocals. He doesn't really have any friends apart from me, so he keeps some weed in his sock drawer for when the loneliness gets too much. He doesn't know what he wants to do after school, but he knows he wants to go and live in a big city. London, maybe. He's so sad because he doesn't realise how beautiful he is. I don't know what I'd be if I didn't love him like I do. I was nothing before him.

We've lived together for twelve months now, it's nice. I used to be one of those faceless people he speaks to online, until we both realised that we couldn't live with being so far away from each other. I moved to the other end of the country to be with him, I made so many sacrifices and I don't regret it at all. His parents are nice, but we just spent most of the time up in his room alone. We don't talk like we used to before I moved in, though. Most of the time I just watch him. It's how I know so much about him.

Tonight, his routine's changed. He doesn't touch the laptop, he just lies on his bed with his face in the pillow and cries. I was concerned, until I looked at his calendar and realised the date. Of course he's upset; it's been a year since I hanged myself.",,False,,t5_2t6kz,False,,,True,t3_18whyi,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/18whyi/i_know_him_so_well/,

It was an ordinary grey plastic wristwatch in every respect except for the fact that it was counting down. ""That is all of the time you have left in the world, son. Use it wisely."" And indeed he did. As the watch ticked away, the boy, now a man, lived life to the fullest. He climbed mountains and swam oceans. He talked and laughed and lived and loved. The man was never afraid, for he knew exactly how much time he had left.

Eventually, the watch began its final countdown. The old man stood looking over everything he had done, everything he had built. *5*. He shook hands with his old business partner, the man who had long been his friend and confidant. *4*. His dog came and licked his hand, earning a pat on the head for its companionship. *3*. He hugged his son, knowing that he had been a good father. *2*. He kissed his wife on the forehead one last time. *1*. The old man smiled and closed his eyes.

Then, nothing happened. The watch beeped once and turned off. The man stood standing there, very much alive. You would think that in that moment he would have been overjoyed. Instead, for the first time in his life, the man was scared.

They won't tell me what's going on, they just talk amongst themselves and poke and prod at the husk of what was once a man. I would give anything just to see my wife again, to kiss her one last time before the poison these monsters pump into me finally finishes the job.

As the sun sunk below the trees, one of the friends went up to the highest point on the cliff and jumped off, while the other 5 watched. Their laughter slowly subsided as they waited for him to surface. It only took half a minute for them to dive in after their friend. Struggling and sputtering among the reeds in the lagoon, they searched hopelessly for him. Finally they disentangled themselves and came up, but they never saw their friend again. Heartbroken they returned to the city and passed a strange and lonely year in which their only solace was the knowledge that they would return to the lagoon to honour the anniversary of their friend's death. 

A year passed and they returned to the lagoon as a memorial, but as they approached they saw their friend standing there, head bowed. Excitedly they called to him and began running towards him, but he didn't turn. As they got closer they called him more desparately, but still to no avail. With joy they ran towards him, but stopped dead when they saw not one but five crosses on the waterside.

After gifting her lover with eternal youth, she discovers one cannot give such gifts to oneself – when she tries, the dark powers rebound upon her, twisting her. Not outwardly, but her heart is turned cold, and if ever she looks at her own reflection, her vision is made to fracture and facet like that of a greedy fly. Unable to see the truth with her own eyes now, the more her lover calls her beautiful, the more she suspects he is lying.

Eventually, in a fit of anger at his mockery, she pushes our hero from a tower window. Her bewitchments ensure he does not die, but a thousand shards of glass pierce his body and he shatters every bone as he crashes through the mirrored dome above her throne room and falls to its marble floor. The spiteful queen has him run through with a hook and hung on a wall to set an example, and it’s only then, when she catches sight of her many reflections in the jagged glass splinters impaling his limp form, that she sees she *is* still beautiful. And forever after, she will believe him when she asks, “Who is the fairest in the land?”

There was an unexpected box on the porch; the package wasn't addressed to anybody particularly,  but my address was on it and the return address was New Mexico. It was a black box, sealed with clear tape and had a white UPS Next Day Air label.   I was curious. I brought the box in, set it on the coffee table and then, using the key to my car, cut open the tape. 

Inside the box were the following things:

- A full black face mask with holes for the eyes and mouth cut out 
- A roll of duct tape
- A length of brown rope (probably six feet long)
- A length of wire (twice as long as the rope)
- A pack of razor blades
- A working flashlight
- A box of matches
- A can of lighter fluid
- A small crowbar
- A pair of handcuffs
- A big knife (with a blade that was sharp on one edge and serrated on the other) in a leather sheath 
- A legal sized white envelope stuffed full with twenty dollar bills
- A photo of me 

Immediately went to grab my phone to call the cops when the doorbell rang. I was a little freaked out, so I slid on the chain before I opened it. I didn't recognize the guy standing there; he said he was the nephew of my next door neighbors and he was staying with them for a little while.  He said that he came over because he'd just gotten off the phone with UPS; it seems the package he was expecting from New Mexico this morning was mistakenly addressed with my house number.

you may have asked yourself where I've been the last week. Do you remember when mom used to tell Ami and me about our ""family curse"" when we were little girls? Well, I did some research and... she was *right*. I visited the graveyard and browsed the family history: every female seems to have died at the same age: 29 years and four days. Mom was ran over at exactly this age, you know? And when Ami drowned last year she was that old too. It continues like that throughout our history: Murders, accidents, diseases. Apparently none died earlier and none later. Creepy, right?
To come straight to the point: You know that I'm a little superstitious. I turned 29 yesterday and met a soldier at the party who says he could smuggle me into a military bunker. I mean, where could it be safer? I promise I'll return in a few days, I just wanted to make sure that ""curse"" is nonsense.

“I may be late getting home tonight,” she says, taking a sip of water nervously, “So much extra work.”

I can see her future.  I know that when she leaves this diner, when she walks down the block and takes an inattentive step into the road, she’ll be run down by a young driver.  That stupid bag of hers will skitter across the road with a spray of blood on it; the driver screaming in shock at the sight of the body that has shattered his windshield.  At this moment, I can’t bring myself to even attempt to alter my wife’s unfortunate destiny, the pain of her betrayal is so great.

“I’ll wait up for you,” I lie.

There are twisty twined trees, there are weeds and neglect,

Footfalls – your own? – in that dim and grim ghetto,

Coming closer and closer as if someone’s there...

You whirl and see no one, just fog on the air.

So you whistle – it whistles. You cough – and it coughs.

Then from murky mists a gray shadow breaks off.

It’s your height and your size and your very same shape,

And then it’s upon you, no time to escape!

You suck in cold air, and then – *poof* – it moves through you.

You laugh at yourself – a shadow can’t chew you!

But you turn and see someone who’s walking away,

This person – your double! – you glimpse with dismay.

They continue their strolling on down the park trail,

While you melt into mist, a fog of gray veil.

Her feet are split so they come to two giant toes with sharp black nails on the end.  Her nose is small on her face and her head is lumpy and misshapen.  My son says she's strong.  She can lift his whole bed up with one arm and apparently she is 9 feet tall.  The most unnerving part is the long hairless prehensile tail that she drags along the ground.

Opening the book while taking a sip of coffee, my eyes flitted upward to admire the rug when I noticed a slight bulge beneath it. Annoyed, I stretched my foot out and dragged the rug towards me. This was to no avail. The bump remained where it was. With a sigh, I brushed off my laziness and got out of my chair, waltzed over and as the child in me screamed to do, slammed my foot on the bump. An ever so feint whimper, but audible none the less, came from beneath my foot. I knelt and flipped the rug over and to my surprise the trap door somehow had been pried open. A bloody finger nail was lying next to the seam in the floor.

Obvious materials can take away from the horror a bit, though some haunted houses go all out and get something like a real cow's tongue.  Gotta love the effort.

This haunted house has really taken it to the next level.  The moment I put on the blindfold was when the scares really started.  The screams of terror no longer sounded like they were only coming from the speakers, and the growling and snarling I heard just moments ago sounded incredibly realistic.  Even now, as I plunge my hand into the next bowl, I have to applaud their work.  It's intestines this time, only I can't tell what they're made of.

So here I am, poking around and making fun of people. There are countless offices here, and the building is old enough to be a little creepy when most of the hundred people, who work here, leave for home. So once in a while, when someone stays late, I sneak close, unseen, and have simple fun.

Like opening their door slowly. Or toying with fuses to make lights flicker. Setting the A/C to ice-cold and quickly resetting it back when they decide to go investigate. Shutting the lights completely in unexpected moment is fun. Or just throwing something off the shelf. Noises are funny too. I've learned to drag my foot like zombie. Or just tap on the long walls, closing in and then stopping a few feets away from them. Few times I even recited some latin phrases from a distance.

Yeah, they see me sometimes, but I learned to hide quickly, so they think it's just their eyes playing tricks on them. Anyway, it is fun seeing them packing and leaving in a rush, sometimes running to their cars, sometimes really scared, shouting about demons and stuff. But it's just me, having fun, there are no demons nor ghosts really.

It was a little more difficult to see than I had expected, but I was already here so I decided not to worry about it.

My head lamp had been growing dimmer, and it got to the point that I could barely see my outstretched hands. Just as I decided it was time to head back, something grabbed my foot.

It began dragging me far away. Farther than I had ever ventured before. Struggling against what ever it was yielded no result. It was strong, and it would not let go. The further it took me away from my vehicle, the colder I got. Then I herd a loud rumble, and a massive rock slide came down on my legs. It either killed the thing holding onto me, or it scared it off, but I was still trapped. The rocks were much too heavy to lift. As my head lamp finally ran out of battery and I became engulfed in complete darkness and silence, I began wondering which would come first. Would I get eaten by some unseen horror, or would my scuba tank run out of oxygen?

Greed’s a bit ambivalent; people seem to mind the gathering of worldly possessions only in relation to the subject’s chosen career path.

Me and Envy have a sweet thing going on since social media and the internet. With people showing off anything remotely good, expecting positive recognition for various outputs and having less trouble hurting others, Envy has more subject matter to work with and I, well, it’s never been easier. All in all, I think we’re doing great. These guys just don’t understand that being accepted like this, instead of being frowned upon like in the past, is a good thing for us. If people don’t reject us, and don’t even notice us integrated into their lives, it’s easier than ever getting people where they should go.

Hm, so I guess I know who I’ll be nominating for the next member of the cardinal sins. Though some may consider him bliss, he’s going to make a fine sin and source of sins.

You can almost understand the physicist's dilemma. They had to create a bomb powerful enough that there was zero possibility of a counter attack, zero possibility of a nuclear winter over the Northern Hemisphere.

That's how they created it. If you can't destroy something with pure explosive force, how could you destroy it instantly otherwise? A bomb that blew open a hole in matter, an unstable black hole.

Of course there was testing. You still can't go anywhere near Area 43.

The delivery was simple. A passing plane simply dropped it on a more rural part of Korea. We lost the plane, half of South Korea, and most of the surrounding ocean. But not because the hole in space absorbed it all.

Turns out a hole in space isn't much different than a hole in the wall.

At some point while I was browsing the internet the lights went out in his room, and I assumed he finally fell asleep.

I didn't see my supervisor until it was time for my 2am break. We exchanged introductions, and he asked me how I was liking it so far. He seemed like a decent guy, so I was honest with him: ""It's not bad. A little boring, but kinda freaky."" I'll never forget my supervisor's reply.

What IS that brown stain, and why does it spread like that? Looks like it splattered and then dripped. Either a really bizarre pattern, or something else. Sometimes it's better not to think about stuff.

Above them, it wasn't long before tortured screams had started to echo on the streets, as their neighbors were systematically hunted, torn to ropes of tissue and re-assembled; they lived anew as homicidal piles of raw, glistening meat and sharpened bone. To drown out this horrific cacophony, the man and his wife clung to each other on the cot and made quiet, desperate love, again and again ... they did so to re-affirm their bond, their lives, their very existence. They did it in defiance of their eventual demise; to be stuck in a frozen moment of heaven, while Hell was unleashed above.

Like a young man smitten, the husband rediscovered his wife's form with grasping hands and sucking mouth, and she writhed beneath his frenzy. She took her man inside her in every way that she'd ever denied him before. They fucked and gyrated and strained against each other in rivers of sweat; in the real world, human civilization toppled and died. Days melded into nights - fires raged above, and lust reigned below. They fucked; they ate; they slept. They lost themselves in a sweet dream of friction and heat.

The man and his wife were startled awake by the sound of a hole being drilled into the living room wall above them. The swarming abominations had finally been alerted to their presence, and the dream was over. The man kissed the upper swell of his wife's left breast, tenderly, then pressed the barrel of the pistol there and pulled the trigger.

It was this story of a young girl being chased through her home every night. But each morning, the stalker was gone.

Finally, the climax of the film arrived and in all its gory details showed the stalker killing the young girl.

Living or dead, doesn’t matter, although it’s usually quicker to go with the latter.

Good thing I work in a hospital.  For months, I’d collected my offerings.  A few “misplaced” blood samples here, some pre-op hair clippings there.  I even volunteered to play tooth fairy in the children’s ward a few times.  I must’ve gathered offerings from over a dozen people, and harmed no one in the process.  Nothing like starting my new life of wealth and power with a clean conscience.  So why did Evan say I was evil?

Dad said taking the train would be fun and we'd have more time to bond as a family, but it's not happening. Mom and Dad got into an argument pretty early on and have sat quietly, separately fuming. I tried to get Dad to play a card game with me, but he said no, and told me to look out the window at the ""beautiful mountains"" so clearly he's still in a mood. I heard the people sitting behind us talking about the tunnel up ahead and that it's one of the longest tunnels in the nation and comes out over a majestic lake valley.

I imagined how dark it would be in there, and turned around to them, smiling, and said, ""What if it's haunted?"" They chuckled and we started telling silly scary stories about zombies or vampires who live in the tunnel. When the train entered the tunnel, it got really dark and we kept sharing ideas. ""What if,"" one of them said, ""when we come out, we find there's a monster who got on the train?"" Or ""What if, when we come out, you're suddenly ghosts!"" I said. When the light at the end of the tunnel started getting brighter, we knew our game would be ending soon so we rushed and we came up with more and more scary ""What ifs,"" trying to outdo each other before the tunnel's darkness ran out. ""What if,"" I said, ""your eyes started to glow right now because you're really aliens!?"" They laughed at that one.

When we exited the tunnel, the train lurched and that's when I started screaming, and then we all did. We were so focused on the imaginary horrors we'd been making up, none of us had considered a possible reality. None of us had said, ""What if the bridge is out?""

He'd had drug problems in the past, and struggled with depression, but none of knew how bad it had gotten. No one saw the warning signs. Maybe we would have suspected something if we'd seen his art...
 
His computer was full of digital photographs; shots he'd taken of the old hospital, the woods around town, his house. They weren't great, as far as landscapes go. But then he'd taken them and photoshopped in these... creatures. They looked something like satyrs and minotaurs, but corrupt. Some were covered with infected sores running with puss; some were emaciated, with broken horns and dessicated skin. Some had insectoid or arachnid features, like compound eyes, and exoskeletons; many had such traits in combination. They're drawn in a style reminiscent of Brom, but the realism of the images rivals anything Giger's ever done with an airbrush. They show how much talent and potential Jeremy had; they also show how dark a place he was in. I miss the guy, and I prayed for him.

A week ago, his brother sent me a box of Jeremy's possessions that they'd found clearing out his storage unit. Inside was an envelope of some of his old work, pictures of the same creatures lurking around town. Unlike his later work, the shots were always from a distance, and the creatures were never shown very clearly; yet I found these photos more disturbing, for some reason. than any of the ones on his hard drive.

The most effective jokes are those that set up an expectation and then defeat it. Take the following example:

Two goldfish are in a tank. One says to the other, “How do you drive this thing anyway?”

The joke is humorous because you assume from the first sentence that the story takes place in a goldfish tank. The second sentence upsets this belief and prompts you to laugh at yourself. The essence of horror is also the reversal of expectations. In horror, the puppet manipulates its master, the inanimate object becomes animated, and your reflection keeps smiling even after you begin to scream. Horror shakes your most basic assumptions about how the world works. If properly executed, it can make you fear the most commonplace things, even things you used to love.

Here’s an example that you might relate to better: Say you rush to turn off the Sinatra song that used to be your favorite, only to find your radio has been unplugged the entire time.

Say you hear footsteps and whistling in the front hall, and you smile before remembering you live alone now.

Say you lock the door to your study and stuff rags in the crack to keep out the penetrating cold, but the door still swings open of its own accord.

There, my fellow lumbermen told me this story about the boss man’s daughter.

She was a beautiful girl with one quirk, which was her love for things most folks consider unsightly – dead roses, rotting trees, old bones and such. Her father had declared her off-limits to his workmen, so she took comfort instead from all things sad and lonely, like herself. Now, in those northern woods there lives a creature of legend with a funny name: the squonk. Some say squonks are animals, some say they are part human, but all agree they’re the ugliest beasts that ever lived. So ugly, they weep all the time! Although monstrous, none have ever been captured, for once seen squonks will dissolve completely in a sudden gush of shame-filled tears.

Well, this girl fell in love with one. Every night she’d slip out to the dark forest, where the pair would listen to each other's sorrows. United by sadness, they made plans to wed and run away, but the squonk had one proviso – that she should never look directly upon him. She reluctantly agreed, and their secret wedding night arrived. Atop a high hill beneath the moon, she closed her eyes and lay back as the squonk took her into his hideous arms and kissed her, deeply and passionately. Come morning, however, the poor girl’s lifeless body was found in that same spot. Her story was sifted from her diary, but her death took some deduction. Eventually it was decided she had yielded to temptation and tried to sneak a look at her lover during their first and only kiss. Perhaps she screamed at the sight of him, perhaps not.

Either way, a high hill was a very strange place to drown.",,False,,t5_2t6kz,False,,,True,t3_1eaopg,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1eaopg/the_sad_tale_of_the_squonks_wedding/,

I feared it because it toyed with my mind. It was as if silent assailants, otherworldly creatures and malevolent monsters were all waiting for the right moment to pounce out of the darkness, though I knew that nothing lurks in those small empty spaces that light had forsaken. In a way, I feared darkness because it brought out the irrational fears within me. My father used to tell me not to worry. He said that there was nothing to fear for “people like us” and that I would understand once I grew up. And as I grew up, my fears did disappear.

I live a happy life now, with a wife and a nine year old son. Recently, my son told me that he was afraid of the man hiding in the empty closet. He sure reminds me of myself when I was younger. “There’s nothing to fear for people like us, son”, I assured him as I opened his closet door. Surely enough, there was nothing but darkness behind those closed doors. My son reluctantly climbed onto his bed and slept.

Just an hour later, I heard screams. I'm so stupid. I had forgotten to check behind the heavy curtains in his room. I can’t begin to describe the pain and agony that saturated those screams. I ran into my son’s room, just in time to see my son feasting on his first victim. Tears of joy rolled down my cheeks as I heard him say, “You’re right, daddy.

Especially during the winter, when the sun almost never visits these shores, and you can't tell where the sky ends and the crushing waves begin. Apart from my weekly visits to the town, my shifts consist of short days and long nights on a small, barren island, alone with the Great Atlantic Ocean.

It was during one of these long, dark nights that a great storm came rolling in from the north. I was hoping I could just chill inside, but the light kept going out for some unknown reason, so I spent the night running back and forth between the house and the lighthouse. After getting a few hours of restless sleep, I woke up in the afternoon to find that the storm had died down.

 Looking out my window, I saw to my great surprise that I had a visitor. A man in a grey overall was standing at the beach, seemingly unfazed by the northern wind blowing in behind him. In fact, he was completely motionless, looking up towards the house. I was about to go greet him, when by blind luck I remembered my kettle of water on the stove. Turning it off, I happened to glance out the kitchen window. Another man had joined the first one, this one wearing a blue overall. He looked like a ship engineer. They both stood silent, slack jawed, staring. The waves washing over their feet didn't seem to bother them. No boat was on the beach. I looked closer. It wasn't before now I noticed their soaked garments, their shriveled hands, their blue, bloated faces. Another head broke the waves.

I had chosen to sit next to the well-dressed business man, hoping to have someone to talk to for a while as she played.  We had a pleasant conversation, just about the news and the weather.

""So, which little tyke are you in charge of?"" he said with a smile.  I pointed out Linda, and we talked about her schooling and things; he seemed genuinely interested and talked about what he thought were the best options in the area.  When I asked him which child was his, I saw a brief glimpse of... remorse? Sadness? Something,  couldn't tell what, flash across his face.  He promptly responded, pointing out a young boy and said ""There he is, my little Michael.  So sorry to cut this short, but I really must be going."" In an instant he was up, and walking toward the playground, and walked over to little Michael and said something to him.

As he was walking past me on his way out with his boy, something seemed off.  He speaking very softly, almost whispering to the young boy.  He was pointing at his car, and saying something about getting ice cream.  As they were passing, I waved to them and was about to say goodbye, when I realized the man never gave me his name.  ""Bye Michael!"" I said, smiling at the boy.  He glanced back at me with a puzzled expression, and right before he got in the car, he said four words that made my blood run cold.

I live to be there for others, even to my own detriment.  The best part about my gift, because I truly would call it a gift, is that I can see the good, the purpose, in everyone.  Even in those who might not see it in themselves.  

My most recent example was a homeless man I saw sitting at the street corner, a worn cardboard sign in his hands, begging for food.  This was about four months ago.  I, being the wonderful human being that I am, drove home and cooked this man a delicious meal with what meat I hadn’t donated to the local food bank.  When I brought it to him, he was ever so grateful, and we struck up a fast friendship.  Weeks went by, as I brought him more food, gave him money, gave him new clothes; even helped him apply for a job.  I worked so hard to put him in a better place, to allow him to contribute to humanity, that it was quite distressing to see him still sitting on that street corner in tattered clothes with that same worn sign after four months.  

Tonight, I invited him back to my home, determined to give him another chance.  I can still see the purpose in him, despite his best efforts to fail.  Everyone has a purpose, and his is just as clear as the last misguided soul I’d tried to help.  As he lies there dead on the floor, some of his blood still dripping from the metal pipe in my hand, I think of all the poor families that he will be able to feed.

She wanted me to purge the world of all its impurities and burn everything that would stand in my way. I had always been afraid of my *other* mother, but I didn’t dare tell mom and dad. My *other* mother would break things while she was giving her devilish sermons, and my parents would blame me when they found out, though they always forgave me right away.


It wasn’t until I was fifteen when my *other* mother vanished. She told me one night that she was going to take mom away from me and then she just stopped coming. That night, mom took her own life. It was during the funeral that I overheard one of my aunts. “Dissociative identity disorder, she gave up”, one of them said.

Sure, everyone has to make choices when they wake up. Things like “what to wear?” or “do I have a bagel or fruit for breakfast.” My choice is a little different. Being a father and a husband, I must choose who I want to be with. Every morning I wake up I roll over to find I am sleeping alone. My wife always was an early riser.  So when I leave the bedroom into the hallway I have to decide to either take a peek in my beautiful daughter’s room or go straight to the kitchen for a cup of my wife’s favorite morning brew. We Catholics can always find a path to guilt. 

For me, it is always an impossible choice to make. I want to be with them both constantly, together, but to choose one means I must neglect the other. It kills me inside because I love and need them both for me to breathe, nevertheless function. But every morning I make the choice to open my angel’s bedroom and look in the toddler bed she slept peacefully in. I take in the sight of her toys on the floor still spread out from the most recent time she played with them. There are fewer pleasures greater than watching your little one create imaginary worlds in front of you and welcome you into it by handing you a plastic fork turned thermometer turned airplane. 

When I’m done my quiet morning daydream, I enter the kitchen that my wife insisted I remodel. There, I brew myself a cup and stare at the new backsplash and sink my wife once picked out that I had recently installed. I only wish she had seen it before she left me alone. But then I never would have changed the stained wallpaper or the saturated sink she rested against when I last saw her had she not made her choice to go. I could never be upset with her for leaving me. She too had an impossible choice; to live with the sorrow of missing our perfect little angel or to attempt to join her in eternity as soon as she could. At least she could make that choice. We Catholics cannot. So each morning I have to make an impossible choice: is this the day I end my sorrow and return to the arms of my loving wife or do I wait through this unbearable pain and suffering with hopes of one day joining my daughter?

Never failing to find you and fill you with screams.

And slip out of the closet to peek down the stairs,

Where you see both your parents – Your heroes! You’re saved! –

I didn’t buy this machine so I could sit at the playground and watch the sunlight streak highlights into the rich, deep timber colored hair of my former childhood self. Nor did I buy it to revisit the days when my smile, as white as snow, would sparkle and dance alongside my bright green eyes every time I ran into my fathers arms. I don’t want to meet myself and show my childhood the upcoming yellow stained teeth, the dirt caked under my fat rolls, the balding head, the spurts of pink lesions caking my body. I only bought this machine to see my father again. The loving, caring, cradling father that held me so close when the night was darkest. The father that would toss me in the air, then catch me just before my feeble body collided with the hard, concrete floor. The father that would have protected me from what I’ve now become. I remember very little of the time I spent with my him, but I remember that he was the only one who ever cared, the only person in whose arms I was fully secure, whose embrace always calmed my chattering teeth and quivering toes.  It pained me deeply when he disappeared. I remember waking one dark night to the sound of thuds, grunts, and piercing screams. There was a struggle, a clutter and clang of toppling furniture, a vicious and horrifying shriek. My small hands draped the blanket over my tiny body and I called out my fathers name as loud as my frail vocal chords allowed. He did not respond. He was gone. I never heard from him again.

That’s all I want to see. I just want to know what happened that night. Tonight. That’s why I’m here, hiding in the closet, watching that child dream. I won’t make myself known. If I need to, I can always press the panic button and be hurled back to my present time. My obese, faltering body is making it difficult to sit here without stirring, but I won't make a sound. I can see the blanket rise and recede in rhythmic breathing. I can hear my father’s footsteps right outside the door. He slowly opens and strolls in. There he is, standing tall, just as handsome as I remember. A white sleeveless tank top tightly hugs his body, he walks with the confidence that always assured me that he was in control, that he would protect me. I’m nervous. My atrophied muscles are tensing and sweat droplets are collecting on my upper lip. This is when it happened. This is when it will occur, and the small child will wake up and fasten a tight grip onto the blanket, screaming my father’s name directly into the darkness.

My father is approaching my former self now. He is whispering something into my ear as he gently tousles my hair. So much love he had for me. My eyes are watering. His long fingers stroke my face and I mimic his caress on to my now aged, decaying face. My childhood continues to sleep. My father leans in and kisses me on the forehead. Ok, any moment now. My hand is tight on the panic button, my heart is racing, I have not blinked. My father kisses me again. Soon. What happens here? What is my father doing? Wait…What is he doing?? WHAT IS HE DOING?!

His son was clutching his flashlight tightly to his chest, but he peeled off one hand and pointed straight down. ""Under the bed,"" he said in a tiny whisper. Dustin's blue eyes were huge, lit up by the flashlight with pupils the size of pinheads. He was terrified. *Don't get mad, don't get mad, don't get mad,* Daddy thought to himself. He sighed. His knee popped as he knelt beside the bed, and his back did that quivering thing that alerted him to move very, very slowly. He lifted the blanket that trailed over the side with a grimace that should have scared the bunny rabbits off it. ""Nope, nothing under here,"" he said, forcing good cheer into his voice. ""But I heard it,"" Dustin said, still in a whisper, ""I *did,* honest. Look closer, Daddy. Please.""

Daddy didn't want to coddle the boy, but he did want to go back to bed sometime in the near future. He lifted the blanket and splayed himself out on the ground, grunting only once as he ducked his head between the frame and the floor. The bunny rabbit blanket was large; it draped over all sides, cutting off the light. But there *was* something there. Something shadowy. He reached out his arm and felt dampness. *What the hell?* If the boy had spilled something on the hardwood floors... And it was sticky, too. Wonderful. His hand traveled further, and he touched softness. Cloth. Flannel. He just managed to pinch it with his straining fingers, and pulled. Something heavier moved with it as he tugged it closer.

""Hand me your light,"" he said, crooking his other arm to reach back up for the flashlight. As he took it, he fumbled it awkwardly, dropping it to the floor beside his face. Jerking away from the impact, he barked out in pain as he suddenly wrenched his back. *""Son of a bitch!,""* he somehow managed not to scream. Panting, with tears in his eyes, he knew he was going to need help getting back up. That's when he noticed the flashlight. It had rolled beneath the bed. He saw something glassy and shiny there; two eyes were staring back at him, wide as saucers. Even in the glare from the flashlight, they didn't blink. They were very blue eyes. And very familiar.

Sitting up abruptly, she looked around, expecting to see someone watching over her. She let out a breath of relief when she saw for her own eyes that she was alone. She decided to venture to the kitchen and retrieve a glass of water for her suddenly parched throat.

That never actually happened, of course, but the scene had played through her younger self's mind repeatedly.

This horrible, gnawing pain, clawing at your innards. Your brain alive with a constant cacophony, as if swarming with thousands of incessant hornets, driving you further to madness. Despite this, despite the deep, unceasing throbs wracking your body with blinding pain, you cannot stop. Your body will not let you.

Your feet, the putrid odor of the dead, none of that matters now. There is only your pain, driving you onward for one last moment of relief. 

Agonizing hours pass before you finally hear another. A whimper in an alley stops you short, your horribly blood-shot eyes widen at the hope for one more moment, one *last* moment... She's alone, a bandage wrapped around her arm is doing little to stop massive bleeding. No doubt she has been bitten and left to die, like so many before her. Her screams pierce the stagnant air as her eyes set upon you, but it is far too late. Like a trapped animal she tries hopelessly to escape, but you are too fast for her, too strong. Your jagged, broken teeth sink deeply into her sweet, living flesh, ripping and tearing through veins and muscle, feeding your undying hunger. She is quiet now, only the faint gurgles of her last, fleeting breath struggling through the blood that fills her throat, as she feebly grasps at the red, slippery, mess that is the strewn remnants of her organs, spread across her lap.

I simply want to have the day in my pocket, so I can take the loveliness out and just admire the ordinary life every now and then. Make this day my own. I make my face smile, because I'm trying to be happy. 

It hasn't happened yet. Good, good. 

A mother and her son play in a nearby sandbox. He's about two or so, dressed in green overalls and a bright red shirt. Things are so simple for him. She's not smiling like I am, and when she glances over at me, she turns slightly away. I must be smiling wrong again. That's always how It starts. I want them to live long, boring lives beyond today. I want her to go home to her dopey accountant husband and watch TV. Watch that instead of me. 

It lays heavy and cold in my pocket, where this nice, perfect, dull day should be, sagging my coat a bit. I cross my legs to help hide It, but nothing helps. This is how It starts. Someone sees me, sees through me, and then I have to start It. I don't have a choice. She saw me. She saw what's underneath. The infinite nothingness. It starts to climb up quickly through my stomach, over my heart. It's in my throat now. It makes me put my hand in my pocket, feel the oiled metal. Soon they'll all be red drawings and mist in the air. Screams with no mouths. My eyes go back into my head. Someone stop me. Anyone.

I do not demand that you agree with me, only that you understand what I am saying.” “That’s fine,” I said, “But I am hoping to build understanding right now. I mean. What if you had a child with a genetic mutation? What would you say then?” The concerned look on his face was no longer practiced but sincere and somewhat agitated. “What makes you think I don’t know what you’re talking about?” he asked. “Ten years ago I had a daughter born prematurely with a genetic mutation producing one of the most awful phenotypic expressions I have ever seen. ” “In that case,” I said, sensing the upper hand, “what do you have to say about your daughter?” He paused significantly, then said, “She’s sitting in the jar to your left.”

You could imagine the strange combination of numbness, elation, and utter fear I had the day my number was called.

Luckily, I was by the front of the crowd, near some guards that day, and I suppose the authorities didn't want any of their own endangered, as they intervened to bring me on stage more quickly than usual. I sat surrounded by armed guards as the warden gave some speech about this wonderful monthly gift and the Regime's great mercy that I only half-listened to.

“Yeah, that’s what’s so great about it!” Jeremy said as he tossed his gear in the trunk. “Warren and I get some guy-time, and we get to camp out in a creepy old murder house. Stupid was kind of our thing back in school.” He kissed Kate goodbye and drove out to the abandoned Blackburn place by the lake to meet Warren.

Robert Blackburn had been a nice man who would turn his large house into a timeshare during the summer months while he went traveling. Except he rarely actually went anywhere, and he wasn’t actually nice. Many times he had hidden in his basement, then emerged at night to torture his guests to death. Blackburn had disappeared before his trial many years ago, but local legend said his spirit would still come for anyone foolish enough to spend the night. Jeremy and Warren had a good time spooking themselves there, just like the old days. In an ancient cupboard, they even found a stack of moldy cards which asked guests to rate their stay, and they dutifully filled them in: “13 out of 10 stars! Enjoyed not being murdered!” Daring each other, they slept in Blackburn’s dank, earthy basement beneath the rotting floorboards, where the killer had hidden himself so often.

When Jeremy arrived back home at dawn, one of the rating cards slipped from his pack onto the foyer floor. Or so he thought. When he stooped to pick it up, he saw handwriting he didn’t recognize.

Every morning, before anyone in the house stirred, He was awakened by the soft glow of light peeking through the window, accompanied by chirpings and rustlings of birds and squirrels. For ten minutes or so, He would look between the curtains and observe the life that played across the stage. The people all played the same parts every morning, going about their routines and movements across the street without so much as a glance towards His window, but He didn’t mind - they were the only part of the day that made Him feel like He was still a moving part of the world. 

It was after ten minutes or so that His caretaker, Laurie, would come in, making her asinine morning greetings in her nasally voice, and proceed to put Him in the lift, so that she could begin His day. He hated being a C-4. Before the accident, He had never even let His own wife wash His underwear. Now, He had some assigned idiot wiping His ass for Him, feeding Him, and turning Him at night, to ensure that His flesh wouldn’t rot out from under Him. The only movement He had left was in His eyes, His neck, and His face. He couldn’t even breathe on His own – His Autovent 4000 took care of that for Him. 

So, it was on a morning of no particular significance that a weak light tickled His face, and He opened His eyes, turned His neck, and looked out the window to a strange world. It was utterly silent – no chirping, no rustling. No footsteps or bike chains. He blinked, and strained to listen. Nothing. Then, He realized that the whole of His world was still. Mr. Dawson and Gale the Beagle were not starting their walk, Mrs. Lawson had not shuffled out of her house to get the newspaper, and the newspaper boy was not shooting down the street. Outside, the world was absolutely immobile. He looked out, furrowing His eyebrows, thinking that He was missing something. Nothing. He looked for the requisite 10 minutes or so, and then turned His head towards the door. He waited. Nothing. Laurie never barged through the door. The house, and indeed the world, lay silent and still. As the hours dragged on, and the only movement was of the sun in the sky, the only sound being the Autovent 4000, He knew that He was completely and utterly alone. For the first time, He was acutely aware of His heartbeat, and this sound filled Him with an unspeakable terror.

It would be far too depressing to find out that a mother lost her only child, so I made sure she never spoke. 

I kept her in the basement, having her practice the violin for six hours a day. She started when she was five. That was 15 years ago. Her playing skills improved so much in the first few years, I thought about sending her off to an institution for gifted musicians. Then I realized, no one knew I had a daughter and if they asked her, she may just sing. So, I kept her there in the basement where she was safe and could perfect her act. She would listen to old orchestral movements, study lines of music theory, practice until her fingers would bleed and the bow would snap. She was my little muse; I would have her play as I practiced my ballet steps from when I was her age.

I will never forget the first time she saw the light of day. I was drinking a morning cup of coffee at the kitchen table when I noticed the basement door was ajar. I spilled the coffee all over my lap and bolted for the front door, knocking over my chair and a bookcase in the process. There she was, my beautiful daughter, arms open and spinning on the front lawn, singing a song for the angels. *Forevermore shall you be singing for the angels. The time is now,* my thoughts confirmed. So, I grabbed her by the neck and dragged her back inside. Wringing my hands around her vocal chords, I heard her choke and a weak *snap!* of her neck left her limp in my arms. I shed a tear; her voice was so beautiful!

Summary of Findings:

Doctor Joseph Rankle was a top neurosurgeon who had his license revoked for unethical practices. Patient files suggest sadism, though that was only the beginning. He was subsequently hired by an unknown international organization that specialized in information extraction through torture. Dr. Rankle had successfully performed head transplants on humans in secret trials, the procedures of which are fully documented in his private notes. Standard information extraction procedures (SIEP) as developed by Dr. Rankle involved full torture of the victim’s body excluding the head of the victim. Upon exhaustion, Dr. Rankle would then transplant the victim’s head onto a living and healthy body, successfully attaching all nerves and muscle function to the point of the victim regaining full mobility and sensation. Torture was resumed until either the desired information was acquired or the new body was exhausted. If the latter, SIEP would then dictate a second healthy body for transplant and so on. In over one hundred and ten SIEP victims, private files show a one hundred percent success rate in obtaining information with no victim holding out for more than four transplants. 

Recommendations:

The innovative SIEP reliably secures any and all desired information from human subjects. As such, this procedure and along with it Dr. Joseph Rankle, should be considered a highly prized asset for the government and its defense. This panel recommends Dr. Joseph Rankle be given a new identity, full access to top secret government funded laboratories to operate, and a position to train other approved neurosurgeons on SIEP.",,False,,t5_2t6kz,1349117436.0,,,True,t3_10ruik,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/10ruik/summary/,

It was a bit strange, in hindsight, that the website let you share files for download but not post links.

The last video I watched, was different from the others. I downloaded it onto my desktop, and started watching - the video struck me as unique immediately. Crystal clear, it showed a little girl in a white dress sitting on a stool and bent in concentration over a piano. The video was shot from behind her, and had no sound, but it was clear that she was practising something, repeating the same pattern over and over again. All of a sudden, the girl's body tensed, and she made as if to turn around. Not wanting another jump scare, I closed the media player and went to sleep.

Since then, my mind keeps returning to what I saw, going through it over and over again. My computer, when I turned it on the following morning, was stuck on the media player, with the girl bent over the piano. For some reason, not seeing the girl's face is making me more and more tense each day - as is the thought that she is always there, playing that sequence of notes, over and over, waiting. I don't go into my bedroom anymore, and when I do, I give my back to the monitor. I'm afraid that if I turn around, she will too.

There is just too much pain. Thank goodness I have my family around to entertain me. I love being around them. My Dad is my best friend and we used to have the best time together before I started to get sick. Mom, she always knows how to make me feel loved and taken care of regardless of how her day goes. Of course, my brother and sister both keep me happy with their constant games and affection. I just wish I could give all that joy back to each of them like the good ole days.

At least they are with me now. Everyone is pretty quiet though and I do not know where we are going but at least we are taking a car ride. I used to love these rides…ugh, the pain...it never goes away anymore. It doesn't matter what my parents feed me, nothing makes me feel any better.  They just cuddle and coddle me now. I love it when they do, it brings me as much comfort as I can find these days. And now I see why everyone is so quiet, we are back at the doc’s office…or at least that’s what my big sister calls it. Not too fond of this place, ever since I was a small thing I can remember dreading this place. That feeling hasn’t changed either, not in my 14 years and it probably never will. At least my siblings and Mom are hugging me tight, even through the pain I still find joy in it. I kiss each of them, thanking them, while catching the salty water on their face as they pull me close. 

It’s just me, Dad and Doc now in this dark and dreary room. Mom said she couldn’t come in so Dad is standing in front of me while I lay belly to table. His face is so close to me, staring me in my eyes and brushing back my hair. I know he loves me with everything in his heart and I know he knows I love him more. Not even a small bite on my back can keep me from relishing this loving moment with my Dad. Wish we can sit like this forever but I am getting too sleepy to keep eye contact. That car ride must have worn me out. Thankfully, Dad is still close but he looks to be in great pain too. I’ll give him one more loving lick, a thanks, to make him feel better before I rest.

Hitting the cold water shocked my system, which probably explains a little why I didn't bob to the surface sooner. That, and I saw something entirely peculiar.

Down beneath the roaring current, tucked safely under a sheltering rock, was a creature most odd. It had blinking pale eyes, humanoid yet small as a dog. Its feet molded to a fin, silver green scales traveling up it's body to leave a fleshy face and expanding gills. I puzzled at it as it smiled at me, noticing (a bit late) that where arms may have been were instead thousands of silver strings, elastic and thin as hairs. I should have swam back up, but instead I met it's touch as it reached out to me.

The strings found my pores immediately, burrowing into my flesh with excruciating agony. I tried to scream and more filled my mouth, my nose, my ear, the sockets of my eyes. It pushed into my body, wriggling inside me, it's own body pressed to mine, burning hot, dissolving onto my flesh. When I felt it no more I pushed myself to the surface, gasping for breathe. I felt my toes and fingers stretch, my teeth gnash, my tongue poke around inside my cheeks. My body obeying commands I had not given. My arms moved, my feet kicking to tread water, motions I hadn't thought of.

It was when I was in tenth grade when I started getting bullied. It wasn’t unexpected since I had such a small build for a kid my age.

One night while I was crying, however, I heard her bell. There she was, standing in the corner of my room, holding a human finger in her hands. She told me that she will protect me and that she was sorry for being gone for so long.

It comes every year, and I dread it. I'm in torment ... I thirst. I'm cold, *so* cold; my body is one with the clammy, frigid floor of the basement that I hide in. It's dark down here, but I can see the spiders and rats that I hunt just fine. I don't need light to see. I don't need it to live, not like you do. Do you miss me still? Do you wonder about what became of me anymore?

I hate this night, more than every wretched night of my existence. I follow you sometimes, on the occasions when you go out after sunset with your husband and children; I watch as you walk and laugh with them, with *him*, and even though I want to scream my despair to the stars I don't. I smile instead. Because I love you, and I always will. Every night, when my eyes spring open and I realize, once again, that my dreams of you were nothing but lies that loneliness told me - every night I'm glad that the bastard took me, and not you. I was trailing behind you at the fair when it snatched me. You never even suspected what really happened ... and I'm so fucking glad that you didn't, because it could have easily been you that got carried off that night, so many years ago. You should never know this horror, what it's like to be dead and cold and so *thirsty*, so *alone*. No, my love, not you. Not ever.

That's why I'm going to go outside at sunrise. I want to see the sun again. I have to do this -  if I don't, I won't be able to fight the raging temptation anymore. I can't spend another Valentine's Day without you. Seeing you last year really hurt, more than it ever has. I punched holes in the floor down here, I seethed and wept and shrieked. I ripped handfuls of brick from the wall and ground them to dust. This awful life without you hurts so *much* ... but I'd rather die than bring you down here with me.When I feel the burning of the sunlight, it will be your kiss, warming me for one last time.

One minute she was alive, screaming at me over some stupid thing I did, and seconds later she was dead. Never liked that bitch-of-a-wife anyway. Our son was over at a friend's house for the night so I was able to clean up the mess without any witnesses. Over a month has passed since then, and i wasn't caught. I'm much too smart for that. Lately I've been feeling a bit ill. I get the chills often and my shoulders feel tired and heavy. My seven-year-old son avoids me too. I wonder if it's some sort of curse sent from my dead wife. I don't care, as long as I don't have to see or hear that bitch ever again.

I decide to have a talk with my son. He seems absolutely terrified by me. Did he somehow find out? Impossible...but I'll have to make sure. I go up to him. Sure enough, terror fills his eyes. ""Son, why are you so afraid of me? It's been a month since your mother ran away and she's not coming back. I'm your only family now."" His eyes frantically look around the room, never looking anywhere near me. ""That's not true,"" he whispered, ""Mommy's still here, even now."" I bug out my eyes in bewilderment. ""What's that? Don't spew nonsense, we're the only ones here!"" 

My son finally meets my eyes for the first time in three weeks. His voice is trembling, but I'm able to make out every word:
""Mommy's still here Daddy, hanging on to your back and shoulders. She's been holding on to you ever since you said she ran away.""

Sara and I spent our entire lives wishing we were the kind of people who did exciting things. We met when we were young, too young to know better and too better to make great decisions. High school sweethearts who got knocked up. You know the type. We had dreams that were larger than we were, aspirations larger than mountains and virtually nothing to show for it. It wasn’t a romantic life you’d read about in books.

 

I spent that week planning our vacation, where we would go and what we’d do. We had talked too often about everywhere we should go. I wanted this to be the vacation of a lifetime, because I knew it wasn’t something we could ever do again. I settled on Paris, we could see the Eiffel Tower and sky dive, walk the streets and pretend like we were still young. It took me a year to save up enough money to afford the ticket.

 

We walked the streets, my hands around her. We dined at all the places we had wanted to and I reminisced about the day we met, graduated and when Abby was born. She never liked to talk about Abby, because that meant remembering how Abby died. This vacation was about life and I was sorry I brought it up but it was time to let go. We let go as we walked to the tower, and let go on the elevator ride up. We let go as we gazed out across Paris. We let go of everything. “We’re doing it, Sara. We’re falling through the sky.” I said in the few fleeting moments of our free fall before they were interrupted by the sound of a canister of ashes hitting the pavement. I joined them momentarily and we were once again together.

If he passed this test, the protege would be first in line to bear the mantle of the chef's legacy and sprawling restaurant empire.

A top chef had to be prepared to cook anything. And for that, his palate had to be exquisitely refined, no combination of tastes could be unknown to him. It would take at least another year to identify and train up another protege.

A gigantic disc, the size of Alaska and several times taller than the Himalayas, hovering over the Pacific ocean. From it, a column, several miles wide was lowered into the ocean and started pumping water into the bowels of what we all referred to as the Mothership, for want of a better word. It's not like they told us what it was called. They didn't tell us anything.

Naturally, we thought they were here to steal our water so we replied with everything we had. Armor penetrating shells, missiles and finally tactical nuclear warheads. I'd seen enough SF to know that they would all just bounce off the shimmering walls of the Mothership, and sure enough – not a scratch. Then they descended to Earth. There were well over 100 different races of aliens, ranging from semi-humanoid, 15 feet tall slender beings with eyes that shone like little suns to amorphous blobs of orange goo who crept along the surface slower than most snails. All protected by the same shields as the Mothership, none of them interacting with us whether we fired upon them or attempted communication. For the most part, they stuck to their respective kind, not doing much at all. No abducted livestock, no crop circles, no nothing.

Then, after a few weeks, they left. Sure, the oceans were a couple of feet lower but other than that it was like they never had been here at all. A couple of crazy cults have sprung up – eagerly awating the return of these modern Gods as soon as whichever ”sins” happened to bother the leaders of the cult had been purged. Some took refuge in the organized madness of conspiracy theories blaming everyone from the UN to the US to the Illuminati for this faked alien invasion.

His friend, a small dark-haired boy, named Herbert, Herb for short, smiled briefly. “Yeah, I bet it is. A map can’t lie!” He laughed and tilted his favorite baseball cap on his head. They were on the edge of a street, at this time of night (they had both said to their parents they would be at the other’s house, sneaking out becoming quite easy) the street was relatively quiet. They balanced on the white lines as though they were tight ropes. 


The blonde boy, Chuck, turned away and stuck out his hands, “Oh boy, oh boy I can’t wait. Those big kids promised to show us a secret when we get there.” He shook the small map, made on lined-paper, besides him. “They’ll be so shocked we even got there!” 


A car whizzed by. 


Shocked still, Chuck halted like a deer in headlights. When the blinding white lights finally faded from sight, and only a ghost of them remained in his eyes, Chuck laughed uneasily. “Right, Herb?” 


No answer.


“Right?”


He turned, terrified of what he’d see.

He started to go down the stairs. He counted every step he took down the stairs to have an idea of how far he had gone. There was no light source; it was pitch black. He aimed his flashlight into the depths and felt uneasy about continuing. That is when he started to hear people screaming ""Help me, please help me!""

Ron didn't want to go any further after hearing those screams. He had counted how many steps he had taken; 150 steps. He quickly made his way up the stairs counting the steps as he went. When he reached 150 steps, the exact number of steps he had taken while going down, he was shocked to realize that the entrance was nowhere in sight, there was only darkness ahead of him.

He frantically ran up the stairs for minutes but couldn't see the entrance. His flashlight suddenly stopped working, leaving him in complete darkness. It wasn't possible, he thought to himself, maybe he had counted the steps incorrectly. After running up the stairs for ten minutes, he finally started to believe all the stories he had heard.

I remember yelling at him to get the fuck out, that I was sick of being his friend if he was just going to keep fucking up like this.

I remember what he sounded like hitting the bottom, like a sack of flour dropped on the steps. 

I remember the scabrous, mottled body that crept from the side of the highway. It crouched over his body. Its tongue came out and licked the blood coming from the corner of his mouth, cartoonishly long. Its whole body was wrong. Its head was too big, its legs too small, its arms far, far too long. It dragged his body to the side of the road, and it ripped into him like an overripe fruit, the juice of his blood the only bright color on its gray, sore-covered body. It looked up at me and made eye contact. It grinned, shredded meat stuck between its sharp teeth. 

And here he is again. I think I'm glad he's okay. If he's still in there. But I don't think that's the case. I think the thing from under the overpass is wearing him like a suit.

It concerns a young man that I once knew, a strange fellow who was obsessed with discovering the secret of *vita aeterna*, life eternal. He was the nephew of my father's accountant, and he frequented the same social circles as I.

I'd heard that he'd taken a sabbatical to the far East, in pursuit of his morbid fascination. A year or two later, I saw him at a dinner party, an event that was organized in honor of a certain political figure at the time. He took me aside when the opportunity arose and informed me, his eye twitching, that he had divined the secret while deep in the heart of Indo-China.

I am old, and my eyes aren't what they used to be ... but it was *him*, I am sure of it. He must have felt my gaze, and when he registered who I was, he quickly turned and outright fled from the scene. What troubles me most is this: I last saw him forty-seven years ago.

He sipped with caution, and finding it cool enough, drank with wild abandon.  Chamomile.  These were his meditative years.  Sixty-one and counting, knock wood.  He remembered a time when he drank his earl gray and it would nary cause him grief; now, it's chamomile or nothing.  He could recall his first taste of tea.  It was 1967 and the strong taste, the taste and the flavor, filled him even now.  He recalled pouring the remnant boiled water onto the child he lured there. The screams were equally as potent.  They dug the boy up in 1992, I believe.

Right after that he left home.  Taking his father's keys to his Ford, leaving his parents buried together and the dogs left on the porch to mold and rot.  Those were his formative years.  Taking in hitchhikers.  Boiling their fingers in his tea.  He could taste the nigh imperceptible nodes of blood, which added quite positively to the flavor.  He wondered if they were all found.  He might one morning, reading his newspaper and drinking his tea, catch a story about half a dozen bodies being disinterred from improvised graves off dirt roads and wonder.

His last one — last, he though, so terminal! — was in the fall of 1989 in Las Vegas, Nevada.  He became careless by allowed this male prostitute to escape.  He could squeal, he could end everything.  The crazed murderer dyed his beard, shaved his head, and put on a pair of non-prescription glasses before leaving for Wyoming the next morning.

Even stranger was how they didn't seem to be getting farther away. In fact, it seemed like they were getting closer to him.

No problem, we can fix that with drugs with very few side effects and a small dose of radiation to the brain, no worse than standing in front of a microwave oven for a minute.

Then we also have a more, let's say radical, option. If you have been diagnosed with something bad which will lead to a slow and painful death, we can make sure that you will be assassinated before it is too late.

It was clear I was different to everyone else, and they never hesitated to remind me of that. They always laughed as I got help from my teaching assistant; they made sure I felt embarrassed and ashamed whenever they could. I could feel them laughing, mocking me.

Whilst learning to read I’d feel them sniggering in the background. I’d watch as the teacher would point in their face, giving them some stern words. “Yeah really helpful” I thought.
I remember running home after school as fast as I could every time. I wasn’t like everyone else, I never watched TV or spoke to the other kids; in fact art was really my only outlet and relief.  One particular night after school I went to my usual “safe haven”.
I sat there crying in the forest; tucked up inside a hollowed out tree trunk. It was beautiful. I sat there for ages as the raindrops hit the trunk above me. I created the most beautiful, fantasy world I could ever dream of. The rain never ceased up once, and I couldn’t be happier.
The following week I noticed one of my bullies had been absent, as the police came to talk to us. It didn’t take me long to put two and two together, as I watched my class mates erupt into tears. 
My bully’s body was found at the bottom of a well in a nearby flooded wood. No one heard his cries for help; not even me. He must have been so scared, burning out his vocal chords as the rain fell harder and faster.
I was still bullied as the only deaf kid in school, but I always remembered one thing my mum had taught me.
Sticks and stones may break my bones. But words will never hurt me. 
I never returned to my safe haven again.

I vowed an oath right then and there that were Nancy not the match for me, then match there would never be.

So after four years of courtship, she and I were bound together in matrimony. Thus spawned my undoing, the details of which I am now set to relate. The first years of our union were prosperous in the form of a delightful young lad, Anthony. As time wore on, the struggles of my occupation and the lady's most intemperate disposition (and how I once lauded it as a reflection of my own!) led to the inevitable dissolution of our once amicable union, though we remained bound by the mutually-perceived necessity of our boy's proper upbringing.

It was noonday in January when the event occurred. Nancy brought me my cup of tea, as was our custom despite much quarreling the night prior. She lingered as I sipped it absently whilst studying the day's paper. The tremors began in earnest as I quite appropriately reached the obituaries. My countenance fell upon Nancy, who only then saw fit to gleefully inform me of the arsenic in my tea. Though the final darkness hastened, providence blessed me with the strength to utter my final three words upon this mortal coil; after which I happily died, having seen them forever wipe that gods-damned smirk from her face.

“Please.” You cry out. Faith welling up. “Please help my mom get better. I will do anything.”

We are all waiting by your side now. Waiting for His answer. Waiting for Him to turn His back on you once again. 

Be careful what you ask for. He does hear your prayers, but so do we.

Comes a plinking, tinkling song.

It pulls you up the darkened stairs,

Your mind on ballets, horses, fairs.

Those metal tines, those grinding gears,

Are raspy music to your ears.

They whir, they spin, within the gloom,

And beckon you toward that room

Where summers stay, and laughs, and love –

Sweet childish memories it sings of.

The dust lies thick upon the floor,

To hush your steps so near the door,

And moonlight, pale, glows from the crack,

But as you reach, it fades to black, 

And with a plink… 

a plink… 

a plink…

The music stops. You twitch, and blink,

Then raise your palm, for there you see –

You hold the music box’s key.

So with a shiver, shake, and swear,

You turn and drift back down the stairs.

You wonder why you left your chair –

A phone call? A forgotten care?

Then down the hallway, nice and long,

Comes a plinking, tinkling song…

Videos, blogs, news; you know. Anyway, the other night I went to open up a new document in order to type up a fabulous new short story I'd written. The story, called The Cryer, was a horror piece about a man who loses his eyes in an accident, goes insane, and begins taking the eyes of children. 

I clicked on the document and nearly fell out of my chair because there he was: the cryer. Just as I'd imagined him: shrieking in mid-grimace with blood trickling down his face. I quickly closed out of the window and tried to catch my breath. Maybe I'd seen the idea for The Cryer somewhere else, copied a picture to my desktop, and subconsciously written a story about it. I thought ""a Google search should clear this up."" 

When I clicked on the browser I actually did fall out of my chair. Because now the cryer was back on my screen, just as before. Except this time he was smiling. More of a sinister grin, than a happy smirk. 

That's when I heard the knock on the window. 

My curiosity won over my petrifying fear. I drew the curtains open. 

Written in blood on the window were the words:
