After many months of building up my stores, slowly draining my stores again when I needed money, and then building again, I've finally reached what I have randomly decided is 'enough' for a giveaway. Most of you probably know the rules by now, but for those that don't, they follow. And for the love of Q, actually read them all this time.

**WHAT:** A giveaway. Didn't you read the title?

**WHEN:** Saturday, March 16th, 2013. Around 10PM EST, which likely means 11PM EST in reality.

**WHERE:** Bajor, maybe. Somewhere in Star Trek Online.

**HOW:** Simply reply to this post with your entry, containing whatever items you would like to be placed in the running for. Be sure your entry also contains your ingame @name, if you don't already have it in your flair. Only top-level replies will be counted. There are various rules concerning what you can enter for, so be sure to read them carefully. They are as follows:

* You can only enter for one (1) lockbox/lobi store ship. So pick whichever one you think you're going to love the most, because there's no givebacks.

* Only enter for items you'll actually use. Do *not* enter for something, win it, and then turn around and sell it. I will be incredibly cross if you do, and there won't be anymore giveaways. 

Seems pretty simple. I'm sure somebody out there is already misinterpreting them, though.

A couple of final notes, before we get to the list. You **do not** have to be a member of REDdit ALERt or House of Snoo in order to enter this giveaway. And you **do not** have to be present at the in-game event in order to be eligible for prizes. I love it when everybody shows up, but that's not always possible, and I'm not going to penalize you for it if your schedule doesn't allow you to be online. I'll mail all the prizes that I couldn't award in person after the event.

***The List***

----------------

* **Lockbox/Lobi Ships**:

 * Two (2) [Special Requisition Pack - Ferengi D'Kora Ship]

 * Four (4) [Special Requisition Pack - Temporal Science Vessel]

 * One (1) [Special Requisition Pack - Temporal Destroyer]

 * Two (2) [Special Requisition Pack - Jem'Hadar Dreadnought Carrier]

 * One (1) [Special Requisition Pack - Tholian Widow Fighter Ship]

 * One (1) [Special Requisition Pack - Timeship Shuttle]

 * **By the good grace of Atheonyirh &amp; 1st Aquarius Division:** One (1) Limited-Time Single Ship Access to a Tier V Shipyard

Hoo yeah. I'm still debating whether or not to apply the ""only enter for one"" rule to the shuttle packs, but for now, assume that it's in effect.

* **Outfit Packs:**

 * Five (5) 2012 Scarf (FED)
 * Three (3) 2012 Scarf (KDF)
 * Three (3) Elite Scarf (KDF)
 * Five (5) Federation Scarf (FED)

That took some time. I've decided not to include items such as doff packs, dual-proc weapons/weapon packs, mirror universe wessels, or special items like temporal beacons in this giveaway, because it would simply take too much time. I do still have them, however, so if you're looking to acquire such an item, come find me in-game.

1374033778.0,66,self.sto,1igpvp,The very final Lucien Giveaway (with reasons),78,12,272,http://www.reddit.com/r/sto/comments/1igpvp/the_very_final_lucien_giveaway_with_reasons/,"Well, this is it, folks. The very last of my mega-giveaways. This one might be a bit of a disappointment, after the last few had just been getting bigger and better. But first, some reasons.

I don't know if you (the nonspecific reader) have been following the various issues that RA and /r/STO members have been having recently with STO and Cryptic, and more specifically, PWE support. I have. The notable incident in question happened with our own K-Vox. Cryptic's database puked during an extended leave of absence, and she lost a bunch of stuff - including a Recluse carrier. If memory serves, it took them over a month to get back to her ticket - and that was only after she posted a rant on this very subreddit. Even then, all was not well.

PWE support told our K-Vox that a rollback was the only way. So she'd lose everything that she had gained in the month since coming back, including all of the summer event stuff, some of which was time-gated and therefore irreplaceable in the time left. But, it was that or suffer the loss of a Recluse, so she accepted. And then... nothing happened. Eventually, she grew frustrated, and sent a rather colorful message to PWE support. Fin.

Whether you know this story or not, this sort of thing happens all the time. PWE support might as well not exist. Volunteer teenaged GMs on private WoW servers do an objectively better job than the customer service arm of this multi-million dollar corporation.

**Any devs that happen across this:** Understand that I don't want to knock on the work you guys do. I love STO, I really do - even if you guys sometimes don't seem to understand how QA works. It's all part of your charm. But I cannot, in good conscience, support an organization that treats its customers - paying and not - like they're not worth the time to even respond to. I have, in the past, run many large giveaways through this subreddit, containing mainly lockbox and lobi ships financed by my wallet. I have spent more thousands on this than I care to think about, and I would love to continue doing so. But I cannot.

As long as Cryptic and PWE refuse to even acknowledge this is an issue, I will not spend another dime on STO. I suggest, dear reader, that if you consider yourself a player with integrity, you do the same. I regret that I must refrain thusly, but as much as I want to give money to Cryptic, I cannot give it to the cash machine that PWE appears to be.

Now, all that said - on to the giveaway!

----

The giveaway shall occur **Friday, 7/26/13, around 10PM EDT**. To sign up, simply post that you'd like to do so in this thread, and be sure to include your @name, at the very least, so I know who to send the winnings to. Also, tell me what you'd like to enter for. ~~There are no restrictions, this time, but as usual I'd be very, very disappointed to see winnings up on the Exchange.~~ Just kidding, usual restrictions apply. Only enter for one lockbox ship. I was only going to have the one, but then some wonderful bastard donated a bunch more. Only enter for items you plan to use, or else I'll make frowny faces at you.

**Items in this giveaway include:**

 - One (1) Cardassian Galor Ship

 - One (1) Tholian Recluse Carrier

 - One (1) Jem'Hadar Heavy Escort Carrier

 - One (1) Jem'Hadar Dreadnought Carrier

 - Two (2) Tal Shiar Adapted Destroyers

 - One (1) Complete Aegis Set (Shields/Engine/Deflector)

 - Nineteen (19) Temporal Beacon Storage Devices

 - Seven (7) Temporal Duty Officer (Federation)

 - Four (4) Strange Alien Artifacts

 - Three (3) Powered Alien Artifacts

Additionally, as bonus prizes for being at the actual event - or consolation prizes for those who miss out, depending on how it pans out - I will be giving away assorted costume packs, cross-faction console packs, dual proc weapon packs, and any phat lewt I happen to have or come across.

I know this seems a bit paltry compared to the last giveaway, but I wasn't planning on doing this for quite a while yet. Please, read (or re-read) my reasoning, above.

**TL;DR** Come on, read it, you're getting free stuff out of this.",,False,self,t5_2rfq3,1374034305.0,,Combo,True,t3_1igpvp,http://www.reddit.com/r/sto/comments/1igpvp/the_very_final_lucien_giveaway_with_reasons/,

(Update to the Thyral situation)",60,5,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/sto/comments/14b6p4/today_you_will_learn_that_the_fleets_just_saved/,"Good news, everyone! You're reading this in the Professor's voice now! XD    
    
First: To all those that both donated time, money, and STO gear... You quite literally saved our lives. We owe you more than I think we can ever repay, and we love you all. (Love you long time! Happy Ending! XD)     
    
We were mired in a violent household with no means of escape, with death threats to the whole household being fairly common. When the family was evicted, the ""man"" of the house (and *oh*, do I use that term loosely...I'll call him Jackass from here on) decided that they wanted us gone because my disabled wife wasn't helping like *they* thought she should. (She has trouble picking up 5 pounds, folks. There's no damn way she could help a family of hoarders pack a 3-ton truck with 15 tons of broken crap.) We had the weekend to move a car that if caught on the road, would be towed with all our belongings, to find a new place to live, that could host my wife with her back. No car (functionally, yes; legally, no), no phone to call for help, and no internet to call for the same (until we found a gas station nearby with internet access, it's where we posted our pleas).  We were royally pooch-screwed, and were expected to be gone by Monday.    
    
You (yes, **you**... you know who you are) saved us from this. You gave us the means to get on the road, me back working for the Dell service company I couldn't make runs for with a car, and my wife out of Dysfunction Junction. You got us away from Jackass, his firearm fetish, his assaults on my wife and I, and a daily screaming and fighting match. You saved us from a house that reeked so badly of rancid cat piss that I often gagged when walking in the door. You saved our lives... **period**.    
    
We've been in tears from the love you've showed a couple of broken strangers that you only knew from a game.... but they're the *good* kind of tears. The kind that only the **very** best in human kindness will bring out in people, and the kind that only a selfless true love [to blaive?] of others will inspire. You've given my wife her first Christmas with her daughter in *15 years*. We decorated a tree with her for the first time *ever*. We can *smile* now. We can laugh. For the love of goodness, we can **LIVE**, when all we had to look forward to at *best* was the loss of everything we owned and the decline of my wife's health, to at worst ending up in the news as the victims of a family murder-suicide.    
    
We owe you, and we will NOT forget. We love you all!
    
[I'd name all the names that helped, but some folks get weird about that. If you have *any* questions *whatsoever*, feel free to ask! To save a few questions,  I'm a Virgo, like long walks on the beach, and listening to heavy metal whilst nekkid. My wife's a Cancer, also likes long walks on the beach, and likes listening to Duran Duran clothed, nekkid, or in fact *anywhere*! I'm also composing an Ode To The Fleet, which will entail some of the worst verse you've *ever* heard.

* Review and relive moments in Star Trek history. Depending on what CBS allows, several key moments from ST history could be implemented as scenarios granting rewards for staying within set parameters. Examples; Battle of Wolf 359, Enterprise's first encounter with the Borg, Trouble With Tribbles episode, to name but a few.

* Your own holo town/locale - see Fairhaven in VOY for reference. this would be used for RP, have a few gimmicky mini games and you could earn local currency to add vanity items to your town/locale. Other players can be invited to your deck.

* Display enemy/species information. (""Computer, display X"") X being a given enemy or item within STO, this would be used like a bestiary of sorts. Adding to this, the more of a certain enemy you've killed, the more detailed information you will get.

It's a gaming laptop. O.o    
   
It has a few quirks, but I've already installed STO on it and seen my toon and boffs for the *very* first time the way they were *meant* to be seen... at full resolution. As mentioned by one of our other users recently who'd moved from running STO in WINE to playing it in Windows, the difference is *astounding*.    
   
Long story short, it's moments like this that make me proud to be a member of the fleets, and I thank you all for being the kind of people that do the right thing.

1369383601.0,50,self.sto,1eylan,A primer on the new FED/KDF Warp Cores,51,1,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/sto/comments/1eylan/a_primer_on_the_new_fedkdf_warp_cores/,"With Legacy of Romulus now live, all starships have a new equipment slot for Warp Cores. Feds and KDF get Matter/Antimatter, and the Rommies get Singularity. I haven't had a chance to dig in to the new Rommie stuff yet, so this will just cover the FED/KDF side of things.

Very Rare Matter-Antimatter Warp Cores have five possible traits. The Type of core is a Power Level buff, the second is a Skill Buff, the third is a different Power Level buff, the third is a battery-style Capacitor power, and finally a Slipstream/Transwarp Buff.

**Type** determines which subsystem gets a power bonus and capacity buff.

* *Overcharged* adds to Auxiliary.
* *Hyper-Injection* adds to Engines.
* *Field Stabilizing* adds to Shields.

**Skill Buffs** add +X to a specific Engineering skill section:

* *[Eff]* - Starship Warp Core Efficiency
* *[Coi]* - Starship Driver Coil
* *[EPS]* - Starship Electro-Plasma Systems 
* *[Rep]* - Starship Subsystem Repair
* *[Bat]* - Starship Batteries
* *[SEP]* - Starship Engine Performance

**Power Level Buffs** add +X to a specific power level capacity (Weapons, Shields, Engines, Auxiliary), and add +X% of the affected system to another system. For example, [E-&gt;W] would add +15 power to Engine power capacity, and +7.5% of Engine power to Weapons. These are denoted by an *[X-&gt;Y]* modifier.

**Capacitors** boost a selected power level for a small amount of time. Basically, a reusable but less-powerful Battery. These are denoted by an *[XCap]* modifier, where ""X"" is the affected subsystem (A for Auxiliary, E for Engines, S for Shields, W for Weapons).

**Slipstream/Transwarp Buffs** affect your Slipstream/Transwarp with one of four modifiers:

* *[SST]* - +X% to Slipstream Turnrate
* *[SSS]* - +X to Slipstream Speed
* *[SSR]* - +X% to Slipstream Cooldown Rate
* *[Trans]* - +X% to Transwarp Cooldown Rate

So, for example, a *Field Stabilizing Warp Core Mk XI [Eff][W-&gt;S][WCap][SSR]* would have the following bonuses:

* +7.5 additional Shield Power, +5 maximum Shield Power
* +16.2 Starship Warp Core Efficiency
* Adds 7.5% of your Weapon power to your Shield power as bonus power.
* Weapon Capacitor: Repairs disabled weapons systems, +15 Weapon Power Setting for 10 seconds.
* +20% Turnrate while in Slipstream.

Hope this clears up any questions!",,False,self,t5_2rfq3,False,,Delta,True,t3_1eylan,http://www.reddit.com/r/sto/comments/1eylan/a_primer_on_the_new_fedkdf_warp_cores/,

Two days ago, [my fleet was over the moon](http://ausmonauts.com/media/kunena/attachments/340/screenshot_2013-04-16-18-03-37.jpg) when we reached our goal of achieving Tier 5 before the fleet's third anniversary that falls on May 31.


Last night, however, that little milestone took on a great deal of sad perspective when I was forced to issue the following message to the fleet...


_____


Ausmonauts,


@Destiny77 (Known to most as ""Iceman"") has passed away.


Iceman came to the Ausmonauts from Federation Special Ops, way back in this fleet's earliest days. He made a name for himself in STO's warzones, and often, the very last thing one would see in Ker'rat was that name above Iceman's infamous Bird of Prey - ""Talk to the Hand"".


It was a fitting name for a player and a friend who took perverse and even delightful pleasure in besting the PVP community's 'elite' where they thought they were safest. On style and class, Iceman stood above them all.


Our thoughts are with his family at this difficult time.


To Iceman; fair winds, and following seas.


R.I.P. my friend...


___________________


The Ausmonauts made tribute to Iceman by converging on his favoured stomping grounds (Ker'rat) in strength. Our ships all bore only one name - ""Destiny77"". For a very long time, Iceman stood as an excellent steward that lead our Klingon sister fleet, the Imperial Ausmonauts. Life forced him to step away from those duties, but he loved STO and his fleet until the very end - and we will dearly miss him.


We ended the night's observance of Iceman's passing the only way we knew how: a round of fleet PVP with the kill count set to a fitting 77. The way we see it, that was another 113 kills that Iceman can use to pave the way to Sto'vo'kor. We hope to have the video of that match up on YouTube soon. (I will certainly post the video here if you wish to see it.)


We gathered on the starbase at the end of the evening, dressed to the nines in the fleet's green and gold. The Last Post was played over ventrillo after we formally broke the news to the fleet. [That tribute is here.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=mIETQAcSI-k)


We shot for the moon and made Tier 5 - and in the same breath, we have lost one our dearest... 


We plan to honour him a little more permanently, although we are still drawing up ideas on how best to do it. I post this merely to acknowledge something that I suspect we've all known from the moment we started playing: STO has one of the best, friendliest and closely-knit communities in MMO gaming. Long may it continue.

Hey everybody!

With Shipyard V coming on April 20th (at 7 AMish), there is going to be a lot of demand for the new ships we're getting.

We want to help you all out!

On April 19th or 20th (depending on my availability), I will be hosting a give-away of Fleet Ship Modules, the item you use alongside fleet credits to buy fleet ships. 

At last count, I have amassed 11 FSMs from various officers and through use of fleet funds. I will be accepting donations for the give-away up until the 18th. 

Lucien, because of his previous experience with organizing give-aways, will be determining who wins the prizes and will send me the list of names before the give-away. He's done a lot of work organizing these give-aways, so I'm giving him a little break.

To enter the contest, please reply to this post with your in-game handle and @ name and Lucien will add you to the list. The give-away is for 1 FSM each. If we have more FSMs than entries, we will reroll the names.

You all have done an amazing job, and now we're on the road to Starbase V and Science V. Keep it up and we'll have a complete Starbase in a few months!

[](/loveyou)- Enzo &lt;3

EDIT - We've received another FSM, we're now at 12!

EDIT2: You do not have to be in REDdit ALERT to join this contest.

EDIT3 - We have received 3 more FSMs. Count is at 15.

EDIT4 - 5 more received! 20 FSMs now!

EDIT5 - WINNERS WILL BE ANNOUNCED THIS SATURDAY

EDIT 6 - Thank you to Kurtis for donating TWENTY FSMs!

EDIT 7 - Deadline for entry into the contest is Friday April 19th at 9:00 PM EDT. Draw will be occurring mid-day Saturday (when I get home from work).",,False,self,t5_2rfq3,1366425518.0,,Combo,True,t3_1bvfr2,http://www.reddit.com/r/sto/comments/1bvfr2/fleet_ship_module_giveaway/,moderator

We also average a little under **700 unique pagehits per day**. Here's a [visual aid](http://i.imgur.com/e9qeX) to illustrate.

While this is definitely great news, I have to remind all of ours readers, especially the newer ones, to *read the subreddit rules*. Not every [gaming subreddit](/r/gaming) enforces rules, but [some of the better ones](/r/games) do, and I count r/sto among the better ones.

**All rules apply when making a new submission and when commenting.** This is all in an effort to keep this subreddit as friendly as possible. I know many of you are great people but there will always be bad grapes, which is an inevitability in any growing subreddit.

Lastly I want to say that I have very little patience for vicious personal attacks on other users. I understand that sometimes we get into heated arguments, but please take a sip of tea and calm down before typing out a regretful response, because I *will* remove them, and repeat offenders will be banned. It's also a good idea to extend this rule to RedditChat as well.

For your convenience, here are the rules, which can always be accessed via the wiki: http://www.reddit.com/r/sto/wiki/index#toc_1

",45,4,129,http://www.reddit.com/r/sto/comments/17g334/dear_rsto_im_giving_away_fleet_ship_modules_next/,"Hey gang. My birthday is next week, so I thought I'd celebrate with a mini giveaway. On February 4, I will do a random drawing and give away four Fleet Ship Modules each to four people. That's right...**each winner will receive 4 Fleet Ship Modules**. If you have been eyeing one of the fleet ships, now may be your chance to get one. 

*Some guidelines:*

1. To enter, post a comment below with your toon and login name (_________@_________). 

2. It's open to the public. You do not have to be a member of REDdit ALERT, House of Snoo, or Mirror Reddit to enter. 

3. I prefer you enter only if you intend to use the FSMs to buy a ship. Of course, I have no way of knowing whether or not you do, so it's on your honor as an entrant. If you have the lobes for such a potentially profitable business venture, sell them if you wish. 

4. I'll post a comment that says ""Contest closed"" around noon (CST) on Feb 4. All the names will be put into a hat, from which four will be randomly drawn. Winners will be announced that day in another post. 

*Some info about FSMs*

Fleet Ship Modules, if you are unfamiliar, can be used to buy a Fleet Ship if you are in a fleet that has unlocked the one you want. STO Wiki has a comprehensive [list of all the playable ships](http://www.stowiki.org/Playable_starship) in the game. The ones that say ""Fleet"" in front of them are the fleet ships. Most of them require 4 [Fleet Ship Modules](http://www.stowiki.org/Fleet_Ship_Module) and 20,000 [Fleet Credits](http://www.stowiki.org/Fleet_credit). 

All right, that's about it. Let me know if you have any questions. 

Good luck!

* **Is it 25 Days to get the Corvette?:** Yes. 40 pearls per day, for 25 days. 40 x 25 = 1000. You turn the Pearls into a Reputation Project for the ship. You can, alternatively, funnel Lobi into buying pearls in a random amount per Pearl box from a vendor on Risa, and get it sooner. You can get 40 Pearls a day by doing the event 'Flying High' on Risa from a person on the boardwalk near the Grav-pack vendor near the initial teleporting in point.

* **Can you get more than one Corvette?:** No. Because it's reputation locked, you can only do the Reputation project once.

* **Who's Palvl:** He's a dude you find at night at various places in Risa Resort. Find him on the beach  during the day and he'll give you a hint of where he'll be come night.

* **What are the Dance Commands?:** Don't use text commands. Detach the dance menu from the chat settings box via the button near the command input area as so, pressing the 'tack' icon to unpin it as a window you can select from freely: http://i.imgur.com/uH6ABr5.jpg. Also, make sure you actually click the 'I want to dance!' button to actually get the mission for Favors on Risa.

* **What if I wanna just do the Dance Commands anyways?:** As soon as you start dancing the required dance, immediately type out '/emote dance_'. This'll set you up to quickly type the rest when the next one pops, or to backspace over the underscore for the 'just dance' calls.

* **What are the Prices for all the Goodies?:**

* Risian Lohlunat Pearl Bundle: 5 Lobi
* Lohlunat Favor Bundle: 5 Lobi
* All Food Items: 5 Lohlunat Favors
* Outfit Box - Risian Explorer Outfit: 600 Lohlunat Favors.
* Outfit Box - Risian Beachcomber Outfit: 600 Lohlunat Favors.

1350923578.0,40,self.sto,11wh9e,"""You know what this game needs? a grind that is required for a grind required for a grind!"" ~ said no one ever.",45,5,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/sto/comments/11wh9e/you_know_what_this_game_needs_a_grind_that_is/,"Rant on.

This new patch seems to be the last straw for me. Instead of just adding progression in terms of gear, they are reworking the old system to become a grind. 

With the changes to EDC/Omega Reputation, I no longer have any incentive to buy more character slots. Prior to this upcoming change, I knew it would only take about 4-7 hours to pimp out a ship in Borg gear. After that, some mk x/XI blues and we are golden.

With the lockbox ships, I have no will to pay money for a random chance for one character to get one ship. The EC value is also too large for the common man/myself to get on all their characters. If I am going to pay money for a ship I want it account wide dammit.

I may be jumping the gun here, but I'm sure these new romulan missions wont be handing out Dilithium with a successful mission and the reputation will require dilithium. Considering Dilithium is the most worthwhile currency, there is no real incentive for me to not earn it. I never did starbase defense or any missions from season 7 because I still needed dilithium. Fleet mark rewards were petty maybe 20 fleet marks for 15 minutes of my time? The S6 space missions gave absolutely nothing for character/ship advancement that wasn't beat by ESTFs and im expecting more of the same with romulan marks. Even now I have no incentive to do s6 missions as officer reports hands them out like candy.

Everything in this game requires dilithium. Crafting, ship purchases, starbase construction, reputation ""missions"", and now even Doff recruitment/grinding. I'm not going to spend hours grinding dilithium so I can spend hours grinding romulan marks. These two systems should be independent of each other to offer incentive to do one or the other. If I were a fresh Vice Admiral, I should be able to decide if I want to grind romulan Rep or omega Rep and not be penalized or forced to do both concurrently. Or make it so after completing one, I can advance to the next one and not worry about the first at all! Personally I think that leads to too much dead content though.

And back to Rep, there is no way that attaining tier 3 of omega Rep will be faster and cheaper than 15 STF missions. Absolutely positively a big ""fuck you"" to the players. 

Look, I know Cryptic/PE needs to make money. But this game is starting to enter the territory of a shitty F2P. When I started playing, I was amazed at how everything in the cash shop was attainable in game through perseverence and time. Now your motive to force people to buy Zen to buy dilithium has not gone unnoticed and I will not buy into it.

And who the fuck thought charging huge amounts of dilithium for DoFF reassignment/general recruitment was a good idea? You should be fired.

TLDR: stop adding dilithium sinks without increasing the dilithium gain and cap. Cryptic, you will only scare potential newcomers and current non-lifetimers away.

**The Seventh Biannual Giveaway Bonanza of Great Justice**
----------
----------

It's that time again, folks. Another giveaway is just around the corner. Things are going to be a bit different this time, owing to experience from last time, and there being a wider selection of top-tier prizes.

**New Giveaway Rules**
----------
----------


 - Each person is now only allowed to enter for a single ship. I may adjust this as entries roll in, so check back, but this means only ONE ship pack, regardless of where it came from or how much it's worth. This means you can't enter for both a timeship and a timeship shuttle, it's one or the other. Again, I may change this, depending on how things pan out.

 - As previously, only enter for items you plan to actually use. If you win a ship, I want to see you using it. If you need money, you're welcome to approach me directly, but I'd much rather you not snag an expensive ship and sell it, depriving someone else of something they might have gotten use out of.

 - Also as previously, it would tickle me greatly if you could show up in-game for the event. You do not *need* to be there to win, but if your schedule allows, it's a great deal of fun. **I'll edit this post with the time, date, and location once I've figured that out.** Right now it looks like we're talking next week, probably Friday, after 9PM EST.

 - Finally, the most important part. To enter, leave a top-level comment in this thread with your STO name (including @name!), unless you have it in your flair. Just tell me what you want to enter for, I'll be sorting through it as we go.

**The Prizes**

Found this quick grind a few days ago and it's helped rack up an easy 60 Romulan Marks every day.

For the daily **Tau Dewa Sector Patrol Mission**, head to the **Nequencia System** for the Trading Mini-Game. Completing the mini-game rewards you with 20% of the patrol mission. It's repeatable with no cool-down time, so do it 5 times quickly and you're done. Boom! 60 Romulan Marks.

**There are three scenarios that I've come across and here are the easiest solutions:**

**Scenario 1:** You receive **Isomagnetic EPS Conduit** and need to trade for **Plasma Manifold**, follow this order:

* Pakled - Alpha-Matrix Compositor
* Saurian - Reaction Assembly
* Rinketian - Plasma Relay
* Pakled - Matter Injector
* Saurian - Plasma Manifold

**Scenario 2:** You receive **Reel of Fiber Optic Cable** and need to trade for **Plasma Coolant**, follow this order:

* Kibo Cri'box - Isomagnetic EPS Conduit
* Pakled - Alpha-Matrix Compositor
* Saurian - Reaction Assembly
* Rinketian - Plasma Relay
* Pakled - Matter Injector
* Saurian - Plasma Manifold
* Benyentic - Plasma Coolant

**Scenario 3:** You receive **Manual Sealing Stem Bolts** and need to trade for **Plasma Conversion Sensor**, follow this order:

* Orion - Isomagnetic EPS Conduit 
* Orion - Phase Compensator 
* Tellarite  - Plasma Infuser 
* Rinketian  - Power Converter 
* Ferengi  - Solar Energy Converter 
* Kibo Cri`box - Plasma Conversion Sensors

You can burn through the sequence in less than 90 seconds and have 20% of the Patrol Mission done. Wash, Rinse, and Repeat until you've earned your 60 Romulan Marks.

I've made an excel sheet with each merchant's trade options, you can check it out here: [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B0OP7Ws9wt0GMjlHZUM0eEpmUmc)

**If you know a quicker sequence, I'd love to hear it.**

I'm going to use this space for general tips.  Other topics will be done as comments.  **To keep things tidy, please add any comments under one of the existing top-level comments.**

Comments and suggestions are welcome, this is still a work in progress.  Also, I'll have to check with uwflatlander, but I think we may need some help with the Science Vessel and PvP topics.

**General Tips**

* The game has undergone some significant changes in the past few months, including a revamp of the skill system.  Any info from 2011 or earlier is probably at least somewhat out of date.  This includes parts of the wiki, so be careful.
* Before about level 40, you really don’t need to worry too much about having the right weapons, officers, ship, etc.  Feel free to have fun and experiment.  However, **silver (non-subscribing) players can only respec their skills by purcasing a one-time-use token from the cash shop**.  So that’s something you may want to take some care with.
* Figuring out which starship you want can be confusing at first.  Here's a [**chart of all the fed ships**](http://www.spidermitch.com/STO/SpidermitchFEDShipChart.jpg).

So after the celebrations the past 2 nights, our fleets now officially have 3 new Fleet Admirals!

Due to a good number of our Fleet Admirals going on LOA or retiring from inactivity, there was a significant low in the number of higher-ups compared to the size of our fleets and how much we were growing. The officership voted and we decided to add 3 new Fleet Admirals!

I offer my congratulations to our new Fleet Admirals!

- Lucien

- Karth

- Pib

Also, congratulations to Pete and Alice for your promotions to Commander! 

Expect a few more major announcements in the near future with some more parties, because there's no party like a Reddit STO party!

1374939325.0,37,self.sto,1j5wf6,New to 50? Read me! A guide to being a new 50 that I have been working on for the past few weeks.,41,4,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/sto/comments/1j5wf6/new_to_50_read_me_a_guide_to_being_a_new_50_that/,"So if you are reading this, you are a brand new level 50 or making your way there. Congratulations! Leveling in STO is a very fast process, especially for Romulan players. The story missions give you a brief overview of how to play, but as you play through them, you travel through this sort of closed loop pipeline where you don’t hear about any of the endgame stuff in STO, especially if you’re not in a chat channel like RedditChat. If you’re like me, you got to level 50 and now you have no idea how the majority of the game works. Veteran players: I would appreciate anyone who would take the time to edit this. I can send you the original Word document so that you can track changes/leave comments for me. Getting someone to edit this for me was an exercise in futility. None of my friends/wife wanted to proofread a 4 page paper about STO. Go figure. Anyways, let’s get started with the basics!

* RedditChat – Type /channel_join RedditChat. Enough said. Hundreds of Redditors all in the same chat channel grouping together, helping each other with advice, strategy and also generally having a good time. There are people from around the world in this channel, so there will someone available to answer your questions pretty much 24/7. Even if you have no interest in joining a Reddit fleet, I highly recommend that you join this channel. 

* Fleet – Get in a fleet! There are many fleets available. Reddit has two Federation fleets: REDdit Alert (RA) and Reddit Star Empire (RSE). RA is often full and also has a complete starbase so there are less donation opportunities for fleet credits. More on fleet credits in a moment. RSE is the spillover Federation fleet and offers more opportunities to obtain fleet credits (fleddits). It is important to know that RA and RSE are essentially the same fleet: officers are the same, ranks are the same, and you can move between fleets as you wish if you ask an officer first. There have been a lot of people recently asking to join RA and refusing to join RSE because it is the “second” fleet. There is no difference. Finally, for the Klingon players, there is the House of Snoo (Snoo). Snoo has a different ruleset than RA/RSE but is not too different. Joining any of the Reddit fleets is as easy as joining the RedditChat channel and asking for an invite.

* Fleet Holdings – The bottom at the bottom right of your map is the fleet window. You can also push CTRL+G. Each fleet has a Dilithium Mine, Embassy and Starbase. Some fleets have completed Starbases, like RA. Snoo is close to completing their starbase. If you click each individual holding, you can see that there are projects running. You can donate to these projects: you can donate fleet marks (a form of currency, more on this later), duty officers (you may or may not be familiar with duty officers or DOFFs yet), commodities, experience points (expertise, used as currency beyond level 50) and dilithium (more on dilithium later). In exchange for donating to these projects, you receive fleet credits or fleddits. 

    Fleddits are a form of currency needed to buy high level items from the fleet starbase and embassy. Often, you need both fleddits and dilithium to purchase fleet weapons, armor, shields, engines, etc. It is important to get into a fleet and donate in order to stockpile the fleddits you will need. Once you donate and receive fleddits, they are yours forever, even if you leave the fleet or take a leave of absence. They belong to you, not the fleet. The Reddit fleets require a minimum number of donations to be promoted within the fleet, so it’s good to get started early. Finally, the fleet holdings offer many passive abilities, so it’s necessary for all members to contribute. 

* Duty Officer System (DOFFing) – You’ve probably heard this a lot. When I was leveling up and sitting in the RedditChat channel, I thought people were having a seizure when they kept saying DOFF all the time: ""I'm off to do my DOFFing."" ""Don't forget to DOFF."" etc etc. The Duty Officer system lets you collect Duty Officers (NPCs aboard your ship) who you can add to an active roster to gain some passive abilities and who you can use to send on missions for you. These missions reward commendation experience and as you level in the commendation system, you unlock some abilities. The DOFF menu is the button under the map that has the 3 heads on it. You can see your DOFFs here, assign them to active space/ground rosters and send them on missions. The overview tab shows you a lot of data about your DOFFs. You can have a maximum of 400 if you buy more slots with Zen, which I recommend. More on Zen later. The overview tab also shows you the commendation levels. All categories reward you with a token to buy DOFFs from a personnel officer (Starfleet Academy or First City? for Klingon players) each time you level. Rank 1 and 2 let you buy a free green (uncommon) quality DOFF. Rank 3 lets you buy a blue DOFF (rare) and Rank 4 lets you buy a purple (very rare) DOFF. Some of the categories also give you additional abilities. Diplomacy unlocks locations for you to Transwarp to. At Rank 3, you also get Diplomatic Immunity (FED) or Maruading (KDF) which lets you travel to enemy sectors to obtain different DOFF missions. Engineering, Medical, and Military let you replicate emergency hologram DOFFs. 

    Under assignments, you can look at your current map and your personal tab to see some missions. Each time you “zone” or move to a different sector block, the missions on these tabs change. You can also click the department heads tab (your bridge officers or BOFFs act as your department heads) to see a different set of missions. You can see there are many, many DOFF missions which reward you various types of commendation XP. You can also get dilithium ore, other DOFFs, expertise, trade goods and equipment. You can fabricate warp cores and singularity cores with your engineering section. If you get a critical, you can obtain very rare (purple) equipment that will sells for millions on the exchange! Your DOFFs have traits that will increase your chance for success and critical success while reducing the chance for failure or disaster. Common (white) DOFFs can die during disasters. Green, blue and purple DOFFs won’t die, but they will be injured and kept in Sickbay for a few hours. Once you reach 100,000 experience in a commendation category (Rank 4), every 10,000 experience you can go to the fleet starbase and obtain a mission that takes the 10,000 commendation XP and rewards you with 75 fleet marks (150 on critical). 

* DOFF Star Cluster missions – There are star clusters around the galaxy. They are off the edges of the sector blocks. Zenas Expanse (ZE), Rolor Nebula (RN) and Betreka Nebula (BN) in Cardassian Space. Delta Volanis Cluster (DV), Arcuanis Arm (AA) and Hromi Cluster (HC) in Federation space. T’ong Nebula (TN), D’kel Star Clsuter (DK), Eridon Nebula (EN) and Azlesa Expanse (AZ) in Klingon space. Eridan Belt (EB), Khazan Cluster (KC) and Afherri Nebula (AN) in Romulan space. Finally, B’Tran Cluster (BC) in Borg space (Gamma Orionis Block). These star clusters have 7 part DOFF mission chains. They require colonists that you can buy from the exchange or obtain from the Resettle Colonists DOFF mission found commonly on your current map. At the end of these 7 part chains, you unlock repeatable “Support XXX Cluster/Belt/Nebula” missions in these zones. These DOFF missions last 4 hours and can be performed once per 24 hours. However, they are not always guaranteed to be available. There is a spreadsheet that people corroborate on to track these missions (bit.ly/doffs1). These missions are popular because on a critical success, you obtain a very rare (purple) DOFF and it is a “free” way to stockpile purple DOFFs. 

* Marks/Reputation System – There are 4 types of marks. Fleet Marks (flarks) were mentioned previously. They are obtained in a variety of ways: from PvE missions (more on that in a second), from the Risa Summer Event or from commendation requests (mentioned previously). There are three other types of marks: Romulan Marks (Romarks), Omega Marks (Omarks) and Nukara Marks (Numarks). These are obtained in a variety of ways as well: PvE missions, Epohh raising on New Romulus, ground missions on Nukara Prime, etc. These marks are used as currency in the reputation system. If you push “U” on your keyboard and click the Reputation tab, you will be looking at the Rep system. You can see that it laid out very similar to the Fleet Holding system. You can queue and fill projects that reward you with a particular reputation. The system goes from 0 to 100,000 with five tiers along the way. Each tier lets you choose an ability from that particular faction and locks items you can queue and donate to in order to obtain them. The reputation system is a very good source of equipment. There are two reputation granting mission: one rewards 800 rep and one rewards 2000 rep. So it takes about 36 days to reach maximum reputation. The projects require reputation marks and various commodities purchasable from commodities brokers. This will be a big drain in your energy credit (EC) budget, but rewards you with abilities and the potential to unlock very rare MK XII gear for both space &amp; ground. The sooner you start on these, the better!

* PvE – The PvE “endgame” in STO revolves around Special Task Forces or STFs. There are many of these in the game. They reward marks, gear and dilithium. You can access the queues by pushing J and pushing the PvE button or by pushing the button to the left of the fleet button below your minimap. Each mission will tell you how many players are required, the difficulty, the reward, and the average time. You can do these by queuing blind (entering a pick up group or PUG) by that is not recommended. There are always people in the RedditChat channel willing to run STFs with you. This is the main source of dilithium and marks in the game. 

* Dilithium – Dilithium is a required currency for almost all purchases in STO. Gear from the reputation system costs dilithium and reputation marks while gear from the fleet store costs dilithium and fleet credits. There are two types of dilithium: ore and refined dilithium. Ore is very plentiful: you get it from STFs, DOFF missions, Foundry missions and almost anywhere. Refined dilithium is much more rare: a player can refine 8000 ore into refined dilithium once per day at 8PM EST. You can also buy refined dilithium with Zen at the dilithium exchange. Veteran players (800 days+) or those who buy a Lifetime Membership can pick up a long (3 days?) DOFF mission at Starfleet or Klingon Academy that lets you assign DOFFs to refine an additional 1000 dilithium. Refined dilithium is a precious commodity and the sooner you start refining and stockpiling it, the better. Refined dilithium is also used to donate to fleet holding projects. 

* Energy credits – The main currency of STO. You get this as rewards during story missions, DOFF missions and from selling gear to vendors and on the exchange. Foundry missions can be a quick source of vendor gear to boost your energy credits (EC). Press “J” and navigate to the Foundry tab. Search for a mission “FED FARM 102”. It takes about 5 minutes and rewards you with common (white) and uncommon (green) loot. You can do this mission once per day. It nets between 500-750k EC. Tour the Galaxy is an event that can reward you with 2-3 million EC each time the event happens by following specific routes and repeating them instead of finishing the entire event. (**Edit: I've been told that Tour the Galaxy has been nerfed with a 4 hour cooldown added. You can only complete this once per 4 hours for a total of 350,000 EC.**) You can also get lucky with very rare (purple) MK X, XI and XII gear from STFs and Foundry missions that you can sell on the exchange. EC is very weird – when you need it for reputation commodities, you always seem short. Then once you’re done with the reputation system, you have too much and there isn’t much to buy. 

* Zen – The microtransaction currency of STO. You can get Zen by selling your refined dilithium on the dilithium exchange. Lifetime subscribers get 500/month stipend. Otherwise, you have to buy it with real world currency. Zen is used to buy ships, costumes, more inventory space, more bank space, more DOFF slots, refined dilithium, special DOFFs, BOFFs, pets, etc etc. STO is a game where a surprising amount of people pay for Zen although recently some Redditors have embargoed the system until the customer service/ticket system is changed to be more productive. 

* Transwarp – This is overlooked a lot. I didn’t know about it until well after 50. I thought it was only an ability that certain ships had. The button below the beam out button on the left side of your map is the Transwarp button. You can Transwarp across the galaxy to various locations. You can unlock more locations by achieving higher Diplomacy ranks through the DOFF systems. Some ships like the cargo freighter, Suliban cell ship and Excelsior have multiple Transwarp locations already pre-set. You can also Transwarp to the Fleet Starbase System and use the Transwarp Conduit behind you after you zone in to fly to other systems. Some warp cores/singularity cores decrease the Transwarp cooldown. Completing Tour the Galaxy in full will also unlock a trait that further decreases your cooldown.


That's it! Thanks for reading. I will continue to edit and update this as I think of more things.

I hadn't logged on to STO in a week or two, and earlier today I realized this was my last chance ever to pick up the Shard of Possibilities. Despite severe graphical problems from recently updating my gfx driver, I played (solo) all the way through to the last mission in the 2800 series. I got past the space walk part, then got stuck during the combat in the promenade. I gave up, aborted the mission, and lazily went to ESD to pick up some regenerators and a more appropriate kit from the bank. Of course, I got carried away with abusing strangers using my Thermal Dampener and Party Popper (if you've ever seen me in ESD or DS9 you probably know how much I enjoy those items) and ended up goofing off until the message came up: ""Attention Captains: The Shard will be coming down in 30 minutes for routine maintenance"" or whatever.

*Holy. Shit.*

It all came to me at once: It was 11:30 PM here in Oregon, STO uses Pacific time, it was the 21st of March and the Shard becomes unavailable on the 22nd. I had half an hour before the Shard of Possibilities would be lost forever.

I initiated a tactical ass-hauling to DS9, finished most of the mission by myself, and got to the final laser space battle with about 5 minutes remaining. Some people were cheering me on in Fleet chat, some were just chittilychatting about the event. In my drug-addled state it probably seemed like fifty times more exciting than it actually was. Anyway, I realized there was no way that I could possibly destroy the Jem'Hadar fleet *and* turn in the mission in just 5 minutes... Until Liza burst into the battle in the most badass way possible, and we both kicked everyone's ass in a crygasm of simultaneous feelings of brotherhood and impossible pressure.

It was beautiful. Where there were once intimidating purple battleships, there was only cool fire and explosions. A single, solemn, MANLY tear rolled down my cheek in the midst of our sudden and super exciting victory.

*But I didn't have the Shard yet.*

I beamed down to DS9, and tried to find the right thing to click on with my mind clouded full of pot smoke. There were like ten thousand people trying to congratulate me on my badass laser fighting, and I couldn't find Admiral Dicklicker in order to complete the mission.

*Just* as the ""1 minute"" notification came up for the server restart, I found the guy, talked to him, turned in the quest, and selected my reward. YEAH! I must be the very last person in STO ever to get the Shard.

Anyway, without Liza I wouldn't have made it in time and that is why I love this fleet and everyone in it &lt;3 Thank you :D

So in the next few weeks, we have two major Starbase projects coming up:

1) Shipyard/Military V

2) Starbase V

As you are no-doubt aware, these projects require a significant amount of resources. Military V requires 1.8 million dilithium and Starbase V requires 3.6 million dilithium. 

Due to this, we likely will not be doing the Starbase project this week to save on dilithium and will do it whenever episode replay occurs. 

For now, we highly recommend that you start hoarding dilithium for these projects as they will be greatly needed. 

Some recommendations to save up dilithium:

1) Trade in 5 contraband for 2000 dilithium from the security officer on ESD, DS9 and the Fleet Starbase (tactical deck).

2) Do Foundry missions. The mission ""Left to Die"" is a featured mission and can be done quickly. Do it with a full team of 5 and you'll each get a significant amount of dilithium. Otherwise, missions such as ""One and Done"" and ""Admiral Bobo"" take about 15 minutes and reward 700~ dilithium.

3) STFs! Get dilithium from doing STFs and, if you have completed your reputation missions, turn in your Borg Neural Processors and Marks for dilithium.

4) Starbase 24. 480 dilithium per run.

5) Deferi Dailies. Get about 2200 dilithium daily for doing it.

6) Eta Eridani Dailies. Distress call at the Alhena System, rescue the Sh'mar near Starbase 157, repair satellites at Traelus, and, if you have 10 computer core fragments, destroy captured vessel at Donatu.

Nonetheless, despite how difficult this will be, we have all done amazing work. [You should all be proud!](http://i.imgur.com/MpB4qkD.gif)

1360325087.0,37,self.sto,184lm5,Poor Man's EC Collecting Guide,41,4,50,http://www.reddit.com/r/sto/comments/184lm5/poor_mans_ec_collecting_guide/,"Here's a method I use to get a lot of EC in a month (10 Mil+)

* Get a Federation, or Klingon character to Level 50. I imagine you can do this earlier than 50, but being level 50 insures you get the highest mark of loot.

* Get yourself an escort of some sort. (Advanced Mirror Escorts and Patrol Mirror Escorts are cheap on the Exchange, as well as the Mirror Qin for KDF.) Outfit it for DPS. Or really, just outfit a ahip for DPS.

* Go to Drozana Station (for all factions.)

* Open the Foundry. (Shortcut Key is 'J' and hitting the Foundry Tab at the top of the window.). Look for the Mission called 'One and Done' via the 'Browse All' Tab on the Sidebar, and pressing the downwards triangle at the top to open the search dialogue. it may have a 'Fed' or 'KDF"" Suffix in it depending on what faction you are. Start it by clicking 'Hail' at the bottom right. The start point is a cup of bloodwine near the bar.

* This is an easy mission that also qualifies for basic foundry rewards.

* ***Alternate Mission:*** There is an alternate mission called 'Looting Range FED' and 'Looting Range KDF' that I find more quicker once your ship is powerful enough and can make a lot of powerful, un-shielded ships pop at once. (Lots of torp spreads, etc.) When you pick it up at the Foundry, the start locations can be found on a terminal outside of the transporters on Earth Spacedock and just by the transporters in First City.

* Do the mission. An escort/DPS Ship makes it fly by quickly. Complete it to the end, completely. Pick up all the loot the ships drop. Both mission uses a nebula around a portal to make a bunch of battleships coming in one by one easier to kill by stripping their shields... be sure to stay outside the nebula area so you can keep yours!

* You should now have a crapload of commons, uncommons, and rares of various flavors, if you got lucky. Increasing your difficulty to 'Elite' will increase your chances of blues and purples, and possibly higher mark gear.

* The Bartender on Drozana should give you 50% sell rate. Sell your junk there! If you want to know if a vendor gives you a 50% rate, just take the rate listed on the item info of an item in the 'information window', and divide it by 2. If they're buying it at the price you just determined, they buy at 50%.
 
* You should make anywhere between 500,000 to 800,000 EC, depending how lucky you are, by selling to the vendor directly. Sometimes it may be less, and sometimes it may be way more. (My personal best has been a 980,000 EC run so far.). Shields and deflector dishes are the ones worth the most selling this way. 

* Certain items are worth more on the exchange, mostly, these are Blue/Purple level items. (Green and white level items are usually never worth selling on the exchange.), and are usually heavy dual cannons with desirable effects (Like Doubled up [Acc] modifiers,.) or tactical consoles of desirable weapon types such as phasers or disruptors. 

* You can repeat this until you stop getting expertise for killing ships, which also makes loot stop dropping.... as there's a daily/20 hour cap on the amount of foundry loot/drops/expertise. This is a 'Per Toon'/'Per Character' limit, so if you have an alt, you can switch to it and continue to farm loot for EC.

* I add this to my dailies list when I do dailies. It's a good way to make a chunk of change fairly quickly and meet your daily cap in one run.


A Smooth Easy 450,000-500,000 EC

* **I found out recently that you can get an uncommon Science Console - Field Generator, level appropriate, up to XI,** easy as a re-playable mission reward.* These don't drop at all in the drop system, being only craft-able or via the Powered Alien Artifact Doff Assignment, so it makes them moderately valuable.* It's a KDF mission called 'Friend or Foe' and one of the earlier missions in the game. It's quick, short and easy, and replays will yield the Mark Level Appropriate Uncommon Generator. They currently, as of this posting, sell for about 450,000 to 500,000 on the exchange for the uncommon. A good way to supplement the method above.

Another Method to get a lot of EC in one go is:

* The Tour the Universe Event. Follow this Guide when the Event comes up: http://i.imgur.com/lomZU.jpg

Thanks to: /u/Startrekker for the Tour the Universe Guide Image Link! Thanks to /u/sir_sri, and /u/jdmgto for confirming that the loot/expertise limit is per toon.

I want to make this subreddit as friendly a place for possible where people can discuss topics without getting harassed, belittled, or otherwise made to feel bad.  To encourage this, I've made a FAQ for r/STO which you can visit here:

**FAQ:** http://code.reddit.com/wiki/help/faqs/sto

The entire moderation team has always been actively been moderating from behind the curtains but there has never been a set of 'ground rules'. I know that the word 'ban' appears quite a bit in the FAQ, but this is mainly to deter troll accounts which I've noticed have been cropping up lately. Typically a user will be warned if he/she is breaking the rules and will be told to stop. Failing that, the *last resort* is to ban the account from the subreddit.

I also know that currently it is not a very robust FAQ in that it doesn't answer a lot of commonly asked questions, but I will add on to it as time goes on and all of your suggestions would be very helpful. I am hoping to replace the ""Beginner's Guide to Everything"" in the sidebar with this FAQ.

On a personal note, I know that I take a hard line with some of you regarding STFs or whatever, but please know that I only do so because I care. If you feel that I'm being ""too hard"", don't be afraid to tell me to stop. I'm a pretty serious gamer and I can get heated about some things, but I understand and respect you if you don't feel the same way I do about games.

Some of our community members are even gracious enough to have extremely generous giveaways, like ^^~~shut~~ ^^~~up~~ [Lucien](http://www.reddit.com/r/sto/comments/1amwf9/giveaway_winners_finally/), [Kurtis](http://www.reddit.com/r/sto/comments/17w56r/fleet_ship_module_winners_nsfw_language/), and most recently, [Lau'wen](http://www.reddit.com/r/sto/comments/1anmcj/lauwens_first_monthly_zen_giveaway/).

Unfortunately, there are some users that attempt to advance their own greed by downvote-bombing every participant in a giveaway thread because they think this somehow improves their chances of winning. I know this has been [joked about](http://www.reddit.com/r/sto/comments/19k51b/what_there_is_a_new_giveaway_on_rsto_well_the/) in the past, but it would be really pretty cool if these users stopped doing this to other users in giveaway threads, for a few reasons:

1. **This doesn't improve your own chances of winning.** We're not stupid enough to think that a giveaway entry that has downvotes somehow disqualifies that person from entering, nor will it prevent us from seeing the entries.

2. **It's not the proper use of the downvote button.** In addition to [rediquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette), all users in r/sto should only downvote comments that are abusive, off-topic, or break this subreddit's [submission rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/sto/wiki/index#wiki_reddit.27s_star_trek_online_wiki). Obviously the moderation team has no control over up/downvotes, but use your best judgement and don't be an ass.

1360441585.0,29,self.sto,187iw9,[Announcement] RA Fleet Rules Part 1: General rules for Reddit Alert,37,8,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/sto/comments/187iw9/announcement_ra_fleet_rules_part_1_general_rules/,"---

**PART 1: GENERAL FLEET GUIDELINES**

---

**GENERAL RULES FOR REDDIT ALERT**

* Don't be a jackass. Should be self-explanatory, but it needs to be said nonetheless. If you forget all the other rules, remember this one, as it is the single most important rule we have.

* Be honest. Honesty is a virtue in this fleet and we expect honesty from all our members. We do not, however, expect you to disclose personal information.

* The main chat channel, RedditChat, is for general discussion and talk. Most anything goes in it with a few exceptions:

* Politics and Religion are topics that can quickly turn into slugfests, so if you are asked by an officer or other member to knock it off, please do so. We expect people to be polite and courteous, in the general chat we don't want people to be scared away by any debates which some may consider offensive or at the least distracting from STO.

* We do not support hatred, racism or bigotry. Keep it out of /r/sto and out of /RedditChat.

* No begging. Ever. Period. Not in fleet Chat, not in Chat Channels, not in General Chat. This is completely non-negotiable. It reflects badly on you as a player, and it reflects badly on the fleet.

* Generally speaking, REDdit Alert is always OOC. You can RP in the channel should you want to, but don't expect it to get much traction. If there are enough members that should want it, we can create an IC channel specifically for roleplaying.

* Be respectful of other players. If other players are being disrespectful to you, the best thing you can do is to /ignore them. Feeding the troll only makes it bigger. This also means no harassing other players even if you think they did something unfair to you. If you feel you've been wronged contact their fleet master or a GM. Harassing them only gets you in trouble and can actually get you banned by Cryptic GMs.

* Be mature in your dealing with others. If you have a problem with someone, be it a fleetmate, or an out-of-fleet person, SOLVE IT. Maturity isn't a measure of age; it is a measure on how you deal with problems, and with conflict. If you do have a problem that you do not believe you can solve on your own, you can contact an officer by whisper, in-game mail or reddit private messaging.

* Your behavior reflects directly on your fleet. Act in a civilized manner at all times. Exceptions can be made if your behavior is In Character in a roleplaying setting - if this is the case though, be courteous and let your co-players know in an OOC-whisper before proceeding.

* Members are welcome to make up events that can be played out in a fleet setting, or possibly with the cooperation of other fleets. If you have an idea for an event and would like some help with it, contact an officer and we will see if we can make something happen.

* Absolutely NO botting, gold-buying or buying of power-leveling services. If you are caught doing any of these things, you will be kicked without warning, without second chance, and all other major fleets will be warned about you.

**WARNINGS**

When a fleet member does something that goes against our fleet rules and policy, we may find ourselves forced to give out warnings. These will not be given out frivolously, and will be backed up by documentation. For minor offenses, we will give out 3 warnings, followed by removal from the fleet if the offender continues their misconduct:

* First Offense: Warning whispered to the offender. Make a note of it in the officer notes.

* Second Offense: Warning whispered to the offender. Make a note of it in the officer notes.

* Third Offense: Warning made in fleet chat. Also, inform the offender in a whisper that further misconduct will result in a removal from the fleet.

* Fourth Offense: Offender removed from the fleet with no further warning.

**REMOVAL**

* Kicking members from the fleet is of course not something that we're interested in doing, but for the sake of harmony in the fleet, we will sometimes find ourselves having to do this very thing. Below is a list of offenses that a fleet member can find themselves removed from the fleet for, and how we should deal with each. For anything but the most serious offenses, removing a fleet member will need the approval of 3 officers.

* Too many warnings: See above. If the offender keeps offending, they will be removed from the fleet with no further warning.

* Playing on a purchased account: Removal from the fleet. We value skilled players willing to put in the effort of leveling from 1-50, not players taking the lazy way out. Also, it's against Cryptic's rules (Counts as both ""impersonation"" and out-of-game trade).

* Buying currency (like EC or zen) or leveling services from people and companies not sanctioned by Cryptic: Removal from the fleet - we do not wish to be in any way affiliated with this sort of business practice.

* Serious offenses: Should a fleet member commit what the officers deem a serious offense (threatening someone in real life, blatant repeated trolling, repeated griefing of other players etc.), they can be removed without warning. This should be reserved for very serious offenses only, and if used, the removing officers should post a detailed explanation of this in the officer forum.",,False,self,t5_2rfq3,1360477832.0,,Combo,True,t3_187iw9,http://www.reddit.com/r/sto/comments/187iw9/announcement_ra_fleet_rules_part_1_general_rules/,

1348259728.0,32,self.sto,109loy,State of the Fleet - Week Ending September 22/2012,32,0,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/sto/comments/109loy/state_of_the_fleet_week_ending_september_222012/,"Howdy folks!

I've been contemplating doing something like this for awhile. I'm bored, and the State of the Game post reminded me of this idea.

Welcome to the first weekly State of the Fleet address, current as of week ending September 22, 2012.

Note Worthy Game Events - 

- [15% off Master Key sale on until October 1st.](http://sto.perfectworld.com/news/?p=687451)
- [Cardassian and Ferengi boxes are dropping again until September 27th.](http://sto.perfectworld.com/news/?p=678911) 
- [The 6th Starbase Special Project - High Security - is up.](http://sto.perfectworld.com/news/?p=676901) AFAIK, RA and Snoo have both completed this. Good work guys!

Fleet Events - 

- [Defera Invasion Zone Fleet Event - Snoo and RA - Saturday September 22nd at 4 PM and 10 PM EDT.](http://www.reddit.com/r/sto/comments/zxkup/fleet_event_defera_invasion_zone_saturday/)
- We had a great photo-op 4 days ago. Amazing turnout!
- [Killer McSlashy is offering a contest for his 300th hour played!](http://www.reddit.com/r/sto/comments/104vby/killer_mcslashys_300th_hour_giveaway/)

Other Stuffs - 

- **RA starbase project rules have been changed to address the extreme amount of time it has been taking to meet doff requirements.** Provision projects that reward 500 XP and provisions are now priority. At 20 hours and easier to fill, it is likely we'll earn more XP in the time it takes to do these projects than with the amount of time it takes to do the 1000 XP projects.

- RA  - Starbase Tier III is nearing completion, with transwarp conduit up next to complete Tier III upgrades. Tier III starbase projects will begin 7 days after transwarp conduit III is filled.
- Snoo - Great work on getting Starbase Tier III done. By completing the Starbase earlier than the other specialties, we get a peak at what to expect for future projects!
- Continue to save up dilithium guys!
- I highly recommend you all perform the doff projects in SFA/Klingon Academy. Attainable every 48 hours, you can get a good amount of common and some uncommon doffs with these projects. These can either be sold for money on the exchange, provided to SB projects or combined for uncommon/rare/v. rare doffs.

Business/Money Matters - 

- Dilithium rate is holding steady at around 154 dilithium for one zen. Translated, that's about 52 zen at 8000 dilithium.
- Master Key prices remain stagnant at around 1.4 million, likely due to the key sale and the Card/Ferengi box drops.
- I know a number of you invested in Phased Tetryon Boxes. The exchange got overinflated yesterday with a great number of boxes in the exchange, dropping the price of the boxes. Keep them on hand for future sale.

Tip of the Week - 

- Did you know that there is a consumable item called Deuterium Surplus that can give you a temporary engine and defense boost? Go to the Alhena System of the Eta Eridani Sector Block and contact the Ferengi there to get the ""Defense Contract"" mission. You will have to protect 3 deuterium tanks from True Way forces. If you successfully protect the tanks, you will earn 1 deuterium surplus per intact tank, the reward surplus for completing the mission AND 480 Dilithium. As well, you can receive Computer Core Fragments in the mission. 10 will grant you access to the ""Salvage Dispute"" mission at Donatu II. Reward is 1440 dilithium.

Defense Contract is a daily mission while Salvage Dispute is repeatable when you get 10 Computer Core Fragments.

See you online! If you have anything you want added to next week's State of the Fleet, leave me a line in the STO mail or PM on Reddit.

**PART 3: RANKS, PRIVILEGES AND PROMOTIONS**

---

**RANKS AND PRIVILEGES**

**Recruits:**

*This is the entry level for Reddit Alert. The plan is that you as a member shouldn't stay a recruit for very long. Your time as a recruit is basically a trial period, where you will have only limited access to our facilities. Once you've shown that you plan to stick around, you will be promoted to Ensign status.*

- Access to Fleet chat
- May donate to Fleet projects and earn Fleet Credit
- May access the Fleet bank (limited access)
- No alts allowed

**Ensigns:**

*Our rank-and-file member rank. Once you're an Ensign with Reddit Alert, you have access to pretty much all of the facilities we can offer as a fleet.*

- Benefits as per Recruit, plus:
- May buy from Fleet provisioned stores
- May invite non-fleet members to fleet maps
- May access the Fleet bank (normal access)
- No alts allowed

**Lieutenant:**

*A Lieutenant with Reddit Alert is basically our veteran rank. Aside from the title change, you get expanded access to the fleet bank, allowing for more withdrawals per day than our normal members.*

- Benefits as per Ensign, plus:
- May access the Fleet bank (expanded access)
- No alts allowed

**Commander:**

*The commander rank is reserved for those of our veterans who have put not only time, but also effort into making the fleet, and the community a better place. As a reward for their hard work, a Commander is allowed one alt in the fleet, along with their main character. This is the highest non-officer rank you can attain in Reddit Alert.*

- Benefits as per Lieutenant, plus:
- May have 1 (one) alt in the fleet

**Captain:**

*Our first officer rank. Captains are those who have chosen to take on extra duties to help make the fleet a nice place for everyone to play in. The basic captain duties include queuing up Fleet projects, inviting new members and assisting with the promotion process. They are also tasked with keeping order in our fleet chat, and making notes/taking action if anyone chooses to break our fleet rules. Captains, Admirals and Fleet Admirals are all allowed one alt, to help ease fleet management.*

- Benefits as per Commander, plus:
- May invite to Fleet
- Access to officer chat
- May see and set officer notes
- May send fleet mail
- May promote and demote lower-ranked fleet members
- May remove people from the fleet
- May manage fleet holdings and projects
- May set the message of the day
- May create fleet events

**Admiral:**

*Functionally not much different from captains, the Admirals have a bit more decision-making power, and are able to enforce our rules with a bit more authority.*

- Benefits as per Captain, plus:
- May manage Fleet bank settings

**Fleet Admiral:**

*The highest rank in Reddit Alert. Fleet Admirals can override existing fleet rules if they deem it necessary, and are the main deciding factor when setting new policies for the fleet.*

- Benefits as per Admiral, but has full access to all management functions

---

**PROMOTIONS**

*We've been working on codifying our promotion process a lot, and have come up with the process below. The first two promotions (recruit to ensign, ensign to lieutenant) are considered automatic promotions in that as soon as you quality as per the requirements, you will be promoted. However, mistakes will happen, and if you qualify, but have not been promoted yet, it is okay to contact an officer about your promotion. It's likely that you were just overlooked by accident, when an officer last went through the fleet roster for promotions.*

*Lieutenant to Commander requires you to go above and beyond in terms of contributing positively to the fleet, and to the community and is done on a case-by-case basis, with the officers discussing the promotion beforehand. As officers though, we can't see everything that goes on. If you as a member see someone that you think is deserving of being promoted to commander, we would appreciate it if you send a recommendation by in-game mail to one of our officers. He/she can then pass it on and we can include this in our deliberations.*

**Recruit -&gt; Ensign:**

* Member for 15+ days
* 20k Fleet Contribution

**Ensign -&gt; Lieutenant**

* Member for 90+ days
* 45k Fleet Contribution

**Lieutenant -&gt; Commander**

* Member for 90+ days
* Must have contributed positively to the Fleet and community above and beyond what is expected of a normal member
* Not an automatic promotion

**Any -&gt; Captain**

* No set contribution
* No set time
* Not an automatic promotion

**Captain -&gt; Admiral/Fleet Admiral**

* Done at the discretion of the current Admiralty, and only when they feel they need to do so.
* Not an automatic promotion",,False,self,t5_2rfq3,1360776068.0,,Combo,True,t3_187ix5,http://www.reddit.com/r/sto/comments/187ix5/announcement_ra_fleet_rules_part_3_ranks/,
1360441575.0,31,self.sto,187ivs,[Announcement] New fleet rules for Reddit Alert - An introduction.,39,8,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/sto/comments/187ivs/announcement_new_fleet_rules_for_reddit_alert_an/,"Greetings all.

As most of you know by now, the officer group of Reddit Alert has been hard at work on the new fleet rules. They are a refinement and elaboration of our earlier guild rules. The main thing we were aiming for was to introduce proper procedures into a lot of the things that we do on a day-to-day basis. Things such as a set promotion schedule, updated rules of conduct, an inactivity policy and so on.

In the interest of full disclosure, we will be making public all our rules, including our guidelines for officers. The rules will be added to the sidebar here on /r/sto so that you can look them up for reference, should the need arise. There are a few things that will need some special attention here in the transition period to the new rules:

1. **Alts:** We have a new, proper alt policy in place with our new ruleset. Due to Reddit Alert filling up on a very regular basis, we have had to cut back on allowing alts into the fleet. As per the new rules, found under [**Ranks and Privileges**](http://www.reddit.com/r/sto/comments/187ix5/announcement_ra_fleet_rules_part_3_ranks/), only those of Commander rank are allowed an alt, and they only get one. In the interest of helping the fleet run smoother, we have had to allow Officers to have one alt as well, so that we can be more consistent in queuing up projects and such.

1. **Removal of existing alts:** With our new alt policy in place, we are going to have to remove existing alts of those people who are below Commander rank. We're not punishing you, but we really need the space, so that new people can join. Depending on how the new alt policy works out, we might set up a weekly day where you can swap characters in Reddit Alert, but we have no formalized plans for this just yet. For those who do have alts in the fleet and who are not Commander rank, we will give you until **February 12th** to remove them yourself, so that you are left with the character you most want to be in the fleet. On February 12th, we will be going through the roster and removing any surplus alts from the fleet.

1. **A new home for alts:** Our Mirror Reddit fleet is active again, and has lots of space. If you want a new home for your characters, we encourage you to join up with Mirror Reddit instead.

1. **Invite Rights:** Since we now have a proper promotion policy in place, it is important that we as officers can keep a closer eye on who joins the fleet and (especially) when. Therefore, we have found it necessary to remove invite rights from the Lieutenant and Commander ranks. We usually have at least a couple of officers online at all times, so you should still be able to get an invite when needed.

We hope that these new rules will bring some much-needed clarity and structure to the fleet, and that this will help us move forward much more smoothly than before. Thank you all for making Reddit Alert the awesome fleet it is, and for making our community so active and helpful.

On behalf of the officers,

Well, it's that time of the year. The time to bring out the tree, spend a ton of money, rage at trying to find a parking spot at the mall, bring out the Festivus pole, and skate around Q's Winter Wonderland 45 times. That's right, it's Christmas tomorrow!

This year has been amazing for the fleet. We've had some ups and downs but we have prevailed. With STO going F2P and through Season 5, 6 and 7, the fleet has grown so much. We now, both Snoo and RA, have some of the most advanced Starbases in the fleet and are just speeding through embassy development. Hell, I expect the diplomacy stream for RA to be complete in the next few weeks. 

What matters most is our community. Whether you're in RA, Snoo or in another fleet but hang out in this subreddit or RedditChat, I feel that we have one of, if not, the best community in Star Trek Online. Need an STF? The fleet's there. 20-man? The fleet's there. Help with Q's daily race? The fleet's there. Real life help? The fleet's there. You are all amazing and deserve a pat on the back.

On behalf of the Admirality, we wish each and everyone of you and safe and happy Christmas (or holiday, if you don't celebrate Christmas). Enjoy time with your friends and or family, drink lots of egg nog (if you like it of course!) and be merry!

All the best, and here's to another great year for the fleet!

----

Now time for your Christmas State of the Fleet!

**Game News** - 

* [Foundry Challenge #5 Voting is up.](http://sto.perfectworld.com/news/?p=791061) The challenge was to create a mission to make a 6th episode for a featured episode. Play through the final entries and vote for your favorite episode continuation!
* [A great image summary of the Temporal Lock Box has been put up.](http://sto.perfectworld.com/news/?p=792951) It chronicles everything you can receive from the lock box along with the Lobi store items that were released alongside it.
* [Spotlight on the Foundry is back!](http://sto.perfectworld.com/news/?p=795181) The featured Foundry episode is ""First Cause, Then Effect"". I've played this awhile back, and I highly recommend it.
* Until tonight at 6 PM EST/3 PM PST, [receive 15% bonus Zen](http://sto.perfectworld.com/news/?p=794621) when purchasing through PayPal, Skrill/Moneybookers, ClickandBuy, Google Checkout, or Steam.


**Fleet News** - 

* It was a long grind, but REDdit ALERT has completed Embassy Tier II. With 1 million dilithium required, it took some time to complete, but it has been done! Next up is Recruitment Tier II. We're blasting through the embassy projects, so keep it up and we'll have a complete embassy in no time!
* Alongside that, the personnel assignments on the RA starbase are slowly starting to be completed. We recently completed the Vulcan personnel officer and the Chef yesterday. We should have all our personnel officers done in the next couple of weeks.
* Snoo is lagging behind a bit on projects and needs support! If you can, try to help out Snoo as much as you can. Remember, doffs from either faction can be put in the Starbases, so consider transferring unneeded doffs to your KDF character and participating in Fleet Mark events with your Klingon character.

**Economic News** - 

* At last check, Dilithium/Zen was around 99 dilithium for 1 zen. At a max refine rate of 8000 dilithium, that equals 80 Zen per day. Considering the trend of the market right now, I wouldn't be surprised to see it reach 90-95 by next week.
* [A nifty Dilithium 101 guide](http://sto.perfectworld.com/news/?p=789911) was posted on the STO website.
* Master Key prices have dropped a bit lately, to around 1.1 million. With a new lockbox coming out soon, now may be a good time to stock up.

**Tip of the Week** - 

Quick tip for all of you folks running Starbase-related fleet actions.

If you're running a fleet action such as Fleet Alert, Starbase Blockade or the 20-Man fleet action, you can utilize fleet operational assets (acquired in the Fleet Starbase Requisitions room) to aid in your battle.

Here is a list of [Military Operational Assets](http://www.reddit.com/r/sto/comments/12vcu6/military_fleet_requisitions_and_you_a_guide_to/). They are very handy and can make fleet actions easier, especially the 20-Man. 

I will be posting guides related to the engineering and science fleet operational assets in the near future. 

Thanks for reading everybody, and see you online! Have a Merry Christmas or Happy Holidays!

(Boycott all future purchases?),43,11,64,http://www.reddit.com/r/sto/comments/1iio5v/focused_discussion_pwes_terrible_customer_support/,"By now I hope that most of the regulars of this subreddit have read Lucien's post regarding his final giveaway and the reasons behind it.  If not, please [read](http://www.reddit.com/r/sto/comments/1igpvp/the_very_final_lucien_giveaway_with_reasons/) his post and the reasoning behind his decision to make that his last giveaway.

I feel that we as a community of Star Trek Online players need to work together to confront Perfect World Entertainment and their piss poor customer service.  Continued silence over the matter will only prove to PWE that they can continue the status quo, and as Lucien and others have pointed out recently, the status quo is unacceptable.
  
Going back and tallying up the money I've spent on this game, I find that since I began playing Star Trek Online in January 2010, I have given Cryptic, and by proxy, Perfect World Entertainment, roughly $400 of my hard earned money.  Now, depending on your own fandom and zealousness that may seem like a trivial amount of money, to others, it may seem like an enormous amount of money.  

Regardless, whichever side of the fence you are on, we should all realize that Cryptic, and to a larger extent, Perfect World Entertainment, should consider themselves lucky to earn both our passion and our money.  Because let's face it, at this point, as a free-to-play game, we don't have to give Cryptic or PWE one single dime of our cash.  The money we do choose to put into the game should be seen as an affirmation of a product that has thus far exceeded even the wildest dreams of players who at the start those many years back found an uninteresting, bland, and short Star Trek themed MMO. 

As Star Trek Online transitioned from a subscription model to a free-to-play model at the beginning of Season 5, more money started to flow into the game with the introduction of the lockboxes and the gamble that many people were willing to put up with just to have a new ship.  That influx of money has ever since snowballed and the dev team has doubled in size from its lowest point because of all the money that has been coming in.  But, it would seem with success comes a sense of arrogance.  I can understand that with the introduction of Season 8 STO has seen an influx of new players, and with that I'm sure a parallel increase in GM tickets being created.  It would seem to me that although the dev team experienced an increase in manpower, the customer service department did not.  

Should we as a community of Star Trek Online players continue to ignore the problem at hand?  Perhaps it is unfair to the devs to consider a boycott of all purchases, they have and continue to add great new content to a game that barely resembles the game that launched those many years ago.  But, we need to get someone's attention and show them that this is a problem we will no longer tolerate.  Fix the problem, or the money stops rolling in.

These are just my thoughts summed up, I want to hear your thoughts about the matter, if need be, a petition can be created.

After talking with the other officers of RA this is our stance on it.

1. Firstly the name of the fleet. There will be three rounds of voting, a qualifier, a narrowing down, and a final. I will set up a separate thread where everyone lists their ideas for the name of the fleet. The top fifteen will be put in a new round of voting and the top five will be chosen for a final round. The specifics of each round will be posted later.

2. For this fleet the Fleet Admirals of RA and Snoo will talk to and choose from existing Captains and Admirals of RA/Snoo and other highly motivated people to be the Fleet Admirals of the new Romulan fleet. We will talk to the interested persons and figure out who will make good fleet leaders. However none of these will be existing Fleet Admirals of RA/Snoo with the exception of one, who is just there in case the chosen officers slack off or leave and we need someone to take over until new leaders are chosen.

3. The Fleet Admirals of RA/Snoo will be Captains/Admirals in the Rom fleet just to help with projects, organization and such. However after the fleet gets going it's not expected for them to have to very active.

4. Aside from the head leadership of the Rom fleet no other officers will be chosen by the Fleet Admirals of RA/Snoo. Rather after that point it is up to the leaders of the Rom fleet to choose their officers and how the fleet will be structured. It will likely be a copy/paste of RA rules with some modifications, but it is ultimately the Fleet leaders of the Rom fleets choice. However they decide to choose officers, rankings, etc... is up to them.

5. If another Reddit Romulan fleet is created for whatever reasons that is fine and we welcome their participation on /r/sto, however there is and will be only **ONE** official sister fleet to RA/Snoo, the one which we created.

Its been around for nearly 8 months now (check forums). In the last 2 weeks its become a lot more common due to congestion and in some cases people cannot enter one mirror universe match after attemption over 50 times in that hour.     

This morning from the 8x players in the mirror universe queue+matches on fed side 10-19. Over 70 were encountering this bug and the ""map not found"" bugs for at least 15 minutes.     

I think its critical that cryptic fixes these types of bugs, since assuming we want new players to stick around. Having completely broken queues will really alienate new players (e.g. you try your first pve event and get kicked non stop and find out its a bug thats been around for ages) who might just go back to another mmo or try nwn instead (its superior in many of the shared features/mechanics, such as proper damage/heal reports at end of pvp / pve events).",,False,self,t5_2rfq3,False,,,True,t3_1fbirz,http://www.reddit.com/r/sto/comments/1fbirz/the_5_second_bug_should_be_high_priority/,

Either Windows 7+ or Dragon NaturallySpeaking (not tested) is required. You may have to start speech recognition the first time by using Windows -&gt; Speech, and selecting Start Speech Recognition. Then just follow the prompts. Once it's set up, run dist/STOVoiceControl.exe and it should run an InProc recognizer (so it doesn't start executing the VR commands that Windows has built in). 

I wrote this in Python using Dragonfly with SAPI 5.4 backend. The program writes a default configuration file. A number of default arguments are provided in config.txt. The format for all arguments is [here](http://pythonhosted.org/dragonfly/actions.html#key-action)

There are some issues with shifting, so shift+r by default doesn't work. I mapped full impulse to g, and that seems to be working OK.

This works pretty well for RP, but since the commands overlap and the program doesn't know what you're doing in-game, you run into funny things like ""go to maximum warp -&gt; (your captain starts running)"". 

I don't expect this to be particularly useful, just more of an experiment. Hope someone has fun with it :)

Some of the commands I have been able to get working with some consistency are 

    Power to All Shields
    Power to Forward Shields
    Power to Aft Shields
    Power to Starboard Shields
    Power to Port Shields
    (Go To) Full Impulse
    (Go To) Maximum Warp
    Scan the Area
    Scan Anomaly

There are also a few entered that I haven't had chance to test, ie Fire All Weapons and Target Enemy.  If there is some interest, I can try to hard-code a ""start firing all weapons"" and ""stop firing all weapons"", which would eliminate the need to keep shouting out or spamming spacebar. 

*EDIT* - There seems to be some confusion as to the configuation file. You can add or modify whatever commands you'd like using the config file that appears after you run the program for the first time. The default is [here](http://justpaste.it/2dir). A sample modification is [here](http://justpaste.it/2dis) which shows how to add some of the suggested commands.

**PART 4: INACTIVITY POLICY**

---

Since Reddit Alert hits the member cap on a very regular basis at the moment, we in the officer group have had to revise the fleet's inactivity policy. This new policy is not in being put in place to punish anyone, but rather to clear up space for new active members. The new limit before a character is eligible to be removed is as follows:

* Recruit: 15 days
* Ensign: 15 days
* Lieutenant: 30 days
* Commander: 30 days
* Officer: 60 days

If you know that you're going to be gone for a longer period of time, but are planning on coming back, you can ~~make a note of absence in /r/sto (preferable, as we'll have out-of-game documentation to refer to), or~~ send a tell to an officer in-game. They can then make a note of you being on extended leave and your estimated return time, and we will hold off on removing you until that date has passed.

Should you find that you have been removed for inactivity and want back in (because you're playing actively again), then it's simply a matter of asking for a reinvite. While your previous rank might not be restored instantly, your fleet contribution is saved, and you'll be able to pick up where you left off, more or less.",,False,self,t5_2rfq3,1371405956.0,,Combo,True,t3_187iy6,http://www.reddit.com/r/sto/comments/187iy6/announcement_ra_fleet_rules_part_4_inactivity/,

Seeing as I currently have 6 characters at level 50 that all need to get their reputations up, I figured I needed to do a bit of math so I could bulk-buy the things needed. I expanded a bit on this, and made the requirements lists you see below, along with a strategy of getting to the next tier. So far, I only have tier 0 and 1, since those were the only ones documented on the wiki, but it's a decent starting point.

Prices below are the prices I get when buying the items with a Ferengi character (20% discount) in my Tuffli (for commodities) or on ESD (for consumables). Hopefully this will help you guys out as well, with a better overview of what you actually need to complete each tier.

If there's any interest in it, I can set up a day a week or so where I will provide my discount services to redditors, so you can save a bit of EC on what I can see becoming a pretty big money sink. Would anyone be interested in that?

1345691072.0,29,self.sto,yoc4e,How to ACT (A semi-comprehensive guide),32,3,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/sto/comments/yoc4e/how_to_act_a_semicomprehensive_guide/,"**ACT**

Advanced Combat Tracker, or ACT, is considered to be one of, if not the best combat tracker and log parser utility for a wide variety of games, and as we all know, commonly held beliefs are never wrong. It can use a variety of plugins to parse logs, and has a nested options menu that was clearly designed by a programmer as he went along. We love it dearly. Grab it from [here](http://advancedcombattracker.com/download.php).

**The Plugin**

You're going to want to use the latest version of Aria's plugin, [sto.cs](https://raw.github.com/Abydos1/act-sto-plugin/master/sto.cs). It is far superior to other ACT plugins, due to reasons. Nab it from the link and throw it into your ACT directory.

Launch ACT, and hit up the Plugins tab right away. Left side of the screen, hit the browse button and select the sto.cs you downloaded earlier. Then hit Add/Enabe Plugin, and you should be good to parse - but wait! There's more!

**The Log**

Your first instinct may be to use the Import/Export tab to parse the log, and that will indeed work. I used it for quite a while. However, ACT can parse Deeps in realtime. Hit up the Options tab, and in the first section (Miscellaneous) you'll see a Log File subsection. Click the Open Log button, browse to your logs folder (for Steam users you'll find it at %steamdir%\steamapps\common\star trek online\Star Trek Online\Live\logs\GameClient) and select your CombatLog. Note that ACT will automatically cull the file as it gets larger, preventing the absurd parse and load times you'd otherwise get.

**The List**

Before we get started, let's make it so we can get our DPS to everyone else as fast as possible. For this, we're going to want to hit up Text Export Settings, under Output Display in the Options tree. Make sure the big bold setting is checked, ""**Export to Clipboard after combat.**"" Next, tap the Add Preset button, next to the Clipboard Formatting dropdown. You are, of course, welcome to tweak this to your heart's content. Some tips, though: Make sure ""Only export allied combatants"" is checked, and ""Prefix Allied statistics"" unchecked. The way I have Per-Combatant Formatting (the useful one) set up is as follows: [{NAME15}: {ENCDPS}   ] (without the brackets, obviously.) The default uses NAME5, which will truncate names after five characters. NAME15 is the longest ACT will allow. Once you have everything set as you like it, hit ""Add Text Format Preset,"" make sure your new preset is selected, and clean up the rest of the options, as necessary. Now you should be good to go!

**The Name**

We're almost ready to get parsing, but there's one last thing to tweak. Still in the Options tab, go down to the bottom, to the Miscellaneous under Data Correction. You'll find a 'Default character name' text box here. If you're using the latest version of Aria's plugin (and why wouldn't you be), it won't use your character name, it'll use your account @name. This is to make it so you don't have to change things around for all your alts. Put your @name (with the @) in this text box, and hit Apply. Now you can finally head back to the Main tab, where the data will soon be pouring in. Feel free to explore the Options tab further - ACT has dozens of cool and potentially useful options beyond the scope of this guide, and indeed my ability to comprehend.

**The Data**

We're ready to do some combat, and generate some logs. Load up STO, and hit up your favorite combat - be it a random encounter just to test, or a full blown ESTF if you're feeling randy. Before combat (many people do it before the map change), type '/combatlog 1' into the chat box without quotes. This will enable logging of any combat events that occur within a certain distance of you (if you can see the numbers, it will log them). To quote our own River, ""Whatever the distance, if you can't see gray, the log is gonna have a bad time."" If, like me, you can see ACT while you're in STO, you'll notice the data streaming in like delicious data-y water. Try not to get distracted by it.

**The Post-Game**

Once you're done combatting things, type in '/combatlog 0' to turn off logging. Now, odds are, the first thing you're going to want to do is lord over the rest of your team how high your DPS is. If you set everything up correctly in the ""List"" section, you should be able to just hit Ctrl+V to paste the results directly in to chat. Of course, this will only give you the DPS figures for the last encounter. Sadly, you're going to need to go back into ACT, right click on ""All,"" and hit your preset under ""Export Custom to Clipboard"" to get the right numbers in. I'm working on a way to fix/get around this. Now you can inspect your results thoroughly - and believe me, ACT has all sorts of ways for you to see how you did. Make sure you have ""All"" selected, and not one of the specific Encounters. ACT registers, by default, six seconds of no combat events as the end of an encounter, so for most instances you'll need to select All to get an accurate overall view. You can see a wonderful table on the top left with all the entities (people and NPCs) involved, how long they were involved, their total damage, DPS, how much damage they took... all sorts of data. Underneath it is, by default, a bar graph of the DPS (EncDPS, or Encounter DPS.) You can change this to a line graph of each entity's DPS over time in the Options menu. Click around a bit, and you can find a breakdown of what makes up each player's damage in terms of weapons and skills. This can be rather helpful. Once you're done looking at all the data, be sure to hit ""Clear Encounters"" underneath the encounter list to clear it all out, so it doesn't get mixed in with your next glorious victory.

**Other Cool Features**

There are really only two features that I both A. find interesting enough to mention and B. know enough about to talk about. The first is simple - in the Main tab, above the DPS table and to the left, there's a little picture of a mountain and a sun. Click this and it will give you some options for making screenshots of the table, graph, or both. Secondly, if you right click on an Encounter (or All) in the encounter list, you can select 'View Encounter VCR.' This will essentially play back the entire encounter, showing you who did what to whom, and how much, in realtime. It's not really useful for STO, and it groups all same-named entities together as one, but it's damned cool.

Now go forth, my children, go forth and parse! As always, if you have any questions or comments, feel free to find me in game.

All of the spoilers will be marked as such so please use [this post as a reference](http://www.reddit.com/r/sto/comments/1ct9qk/in_response_to_several_requests_we_have/) to avoid spoiling any of the story to the people not in the beta.

Remember - DO NOT mouse over any spoiler links unless you don't care about spoilers or you've played through the available storyline. Same goes for checking the post source.

That said, let's begin.


[Starting area](/s ""In my opinion currently the best starting area of all 3 factions and one of my favorite ground maps in the entire game, second only to Crateris. I just love the rustic architecture combined with advanced windmills around the area. It really feels like a colony we'd see in a TNG episode. I genuinely enjoyed the way different mechanics were introduced. Like a short lesson on how to fire your weapon by shooting bottles. It just feels natural. Especially with how alive the place seems and it really sets the atmosphere for the remainder of the story. The place is relaxing and peaceful and you can see that romulan people still have a lot of work to do but they're finally happy."")

[Starting area](/s ""Then first signs of trouble appear as you explore that giant cavern. Which, by the way, is immensely cool looking. I love the way they're using ambient lighting to make it darker compared to the bright surface world."")

[Starting area](/s ""Meeting Khev and following his search for his sister is an amazing way to add more depth to the entire storyline. I just love how involved your bridge officers are. Each one has a backstory. And exploring Khev's backstory really adds a lot."")

[Starting area](/s ""All in all the starting area is miles ahead of what the Federation has going with the borg stuff."")

[Early missions](/s ""Of all the missions before you hit level 10 and you have to choose your alliance, Crateris and Suliban Helix stand out the most. Crateris has an amazing looking asteroid field in orbit and there's something special about the surface once you go planetside. The valley, the buildings in the distance, warm, orange lights, the sound of distant thunder. Untill all hell breaks loose and giant tripods show up with that same ship that destroyed Virinat colony floating over your head. The atmosphere of that place is amazing. And meeting new characters, as well as adding some back story to someone we'll see much later on is a great way to make me want to replay the old missions again. I wonder if they'll react differently to romulan captains after this initial storyline? Hakeev and Slamek being present in the early missions, and even us being the reason Hakeev has lost his eye (a detail Salami was kind enough to point out for me since I had missedd it) will hopefully be reflected in the Vault storyline."")

[Early missions](/s ""I also hope we'll see the Suliban Helix featured more in the future. The design of their station and cell ships, the fact that they're in the game now... I love it. I hope we'll get to see more of them. Furthermore I was very happy to see some interesting mechanics being used in some of the missions. Using your bridge officer to block a camera so you can hack a terminal was a very nice touch with some nice humor going with it. There's a lot of cloak and dagger stuff going on and I wonder if all those various dialogue choices will change the outcome in some of the missions (such as choosing whether or not to trust the Reman colony leader...) as well as a lot of betrayal and lack of trust. Really feels romulan."")

[Choosing your alliance](/s ""I was wondering how we'd get the Klingons to trust us. Ambassador Jiro was very excited and there was no doubt that the Federation would accept us, but it was clear that none of the Klingons on Khitomer trusted us. Even after fighting Hakeev in orbit they still made a wise choice of not trusting us. After all, he did run away so it could have been staged. But that sacrifice at the end. That whole ""remember this"" line actually gave me chills. Showing a klingon that a romulan would sacrifice his own life to save him and through that pave a way for the Empire to trust the Republic... Amazing. I expected something cheesy like they trusting us after we fought off Hakeev and convinced them that we're all nice and fuzzy. I did not expect one of the main Republic characters to lay down his life. Also, Sela is a whore. More on that in the next part."")

[Levels 10-20](/s ""Sela. Jesus Christ that woman is insane on so many different levels. I've hated her for a while, ever since I first played Romulan missions, but dear lord did they crank that up to 11. That whole indoctrination mission and the way you're forced to do all kinds of horrible things, despite you trying your hardest to resist only to have none of it matter. I did everything I possibly could to save that prisoner. Then I tried to kill her to save her from that awful fate. And in the end none of it mattered. I still had to borgify her. Slowly losing control over yourself was really disturbingly well done. Revenge and escape sure felt sweet after that. Also, Memory Lane mission and going back to Virinat... I really liked that place. And now all I have left from it is a painting we found in some ruins. I was reading some feedback threads on the forums and someone had mentioned that they've lost their home in a fire so going back to that ruin was really emotional for them. Well done Cryptic."")

[New Romulus Command](/s ""Okay, this place is beautiful. The rest of New Romulus may be a mud ball but this place is stunning. The interiors, the view from the balcony. I just wish there was an introduction to it, a way to explain how and when was this place built. Maybe have D'Tan show us around when we first beam in? Also, I haven't thought of trying it, but what happens if you go to New Romulus as a Romulan? Do you get the same intro as KDF and Starfleet? Would make little sense since we already know all about that place. We're the ones who found both the world suitable for colonization as well as the sword in that rock."")

[Thoughts in general](/s ""All in all the storyline so far is amazing. I'm dying to know more about how it unfolds, if Khev will find his sister, will the characters we meet now reflect that in the Vault arc... So far the entire thing has been incredibly well done. It's oozing with production value. There are some minor issues to be resolved but honestly, this is the most fun I've had in an MMO this early on. I'm immersed in the storyline and I actually care about my bridge officers. They all have a story behind them. They're not some generic boffs you get as you level up. Well done Cryptic. I'm genuinely enjoying this."")

That's what I have so far. I have definitely forgotten to mention a lot of things since there's a lot going on, but that's the basic gist of it. Please share your opinions and thoughts. I'd love to hear more points of view, constructive criticism and such. Oh and please don't forget to use spoiler tags. Other people deserve to have their story unspoiled. We've done enough damage by discussing it so far.",,False,self,t5_2rfq3,False,,Combo,True,t3_1cv3me,http://www.reddit.com/r/sto/comments/1cv3me/romulan_storyline_thoughts_heavy_spoilers_ahead/,

**PART 2: OFFICER GUIDELINES**

---

Your position as a fleet officer, specialized function or not, is a very important one. You are expected to be much more than a normal member, not just in terms of the effort you put into helping the fleet along, but also in terms of just being a player. For this reason, we've chosen to write up these general guidelines on how to behave:

* Every officer should be subscribed to /r/racommand and the RAcommand channel in game (ask for an invite). It is where we talk outside the game and any new rules and such discussed, there is no reason a Reddit Alert officer wouldn't have a reddit account and able to check it.

* Any major issues or decisions should be discussed on r/racommand. While it's fine to talk about them on the officer channel in game, not all officers can be online at the same time. Therefore the final decision must be made on r/racommand to give everyone a chance to voice their opinion.

* We hold officers to higher standards than enlisted men. As such while it's fine to joke around and mess with people, under no circumstances should an officer use their rank to say ""I'm right and deal with it"" or berate someone else. Always be polite to others, even those who don't deserve it.

* Treat people with respect, and never condescend people for being new players.

* Have nigh infinite patience with people. If they don't understand what you're saying, try explaining it in a different manner.

* If someone is harassing you, tell them politely (without swearing) to stop it, and report them (without warning) if they keep it up. Never stoop to their level and use name-calling or worse.

* Promote use of Fleet facilities.

* Be active on our subreddits (/r/sto, /r/stobuilds, /r/racommand), and try to provide as much help as you can there, in terms of well-documented information (preferably with links or somesuch).

* Attend as many events as possible, to set a good example.

* Encourage others to attend events as well, by reminding them occasionally in Reddit chat.

* Keep swearing to a minimum

* Occasional swearing is allowed, but since we're trying to project ourselves as being a mature fleet, keep it to a bare minimum - excessive swearing makes you come off as immature. This applies to any and all forms of communication, including TeamSpeak.

* Set an example for others to follow

* While we expect any RA member to set a good example to the rest of the server in how we deal with people, how we act in teams, etc. This applies double for an officer - not only do you have to do this to non-RA players, but your fleetmates will also look to you as the example on how to act. Therefore, try to be aware of what you're saying and doing, and how others might understand it.

* If ever there is a problem you're not sure how to deal with, either post it to /r/racommand or kick it up to an Admiral or Fleet Admiral to handle. We prefer you be overly cautious to losing your temper and acting rashly.

* We highly encourage officers to take the lead in organizing fleet events, STFS, posting conversations about the game on r/sto, and similar. Officers should set the example and encourage our members to talk and generally just enjoy the game.

* The most important rule of all: We want EVERY fleet member to have FUN playing STO. Never forget that ultimately it's a game and the goal is to have fun and just enjoy oneself.",,False,self,t5_2rfq3,False,,Combo,True,t3_187iwq,http://www.reddit.com/r/sto/comments/187iwq/announcement_ra_fleet_rules_part_2_officer/,

So I was doing Cure Space Elite with Reddit Continuum but we were short one, so we decided to get a ringer from the EliteSTF channel. We explained to him our strategy, which consists of two Kang defenders (the lowest DPS) and three assault group members (highest DPS), who will wipe out the probes and then the cubes.

He began complaining in the fleet action window that there should be only one Kang defender, not two; which would have been somewhat agreeable if I had been flying an escort, but I was in a carrier which is very difficult to maneuver. This is also a strategy that we've used dozens of times to complete the optional with at least two minutes to spare, without fail.

Our instincts told us to just leave and create a new fleet action, but we decided to start anyway. As soon as the ringer saw that two were defending the Kang, he flies as far away as possible and forfeits any attempt at completing the mission and starts calling us ""noobs"" that should ""stop playing elite"" (albeit with severely worse spelling). He also refused to leave to avoid the penalty, which is a dead giveaway that he was either trolling or had no fucking clue what he was doing because leaving a private fleet action doesn't result in having the STF abandon penalty.

**Chat log:** http://i.imgur.com/nHrS8.jpg

He also complained about our ""incompetence"" in the EliteSTF channel afterwards and I was shocked to read that the other channel members agreed with him, so I've unsubscribed from that cesspool.

If you are ever ringing for a group, remember that you are a ringer and should follow the orders of the fleet action host, not make demands and then act like a child who didn't get ice cream.",,False,self,t5_2rfq3,False,,Delta,True,t3_r9kr4,http://www.reddit.com/r/sto/comments/r9kr4/beware_the_ringer/,
1330541120.0,30,self.sto,qbnda,"Message from the ""Leadership"" of REDdit Alert",36,6,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/sto/comments/qbnda/message_from_the_leadership_of_reddit_alert/,"I have been keeping quiet through all this drama but I feel at this point it is doing more damage keeping people in the dark and I need to go on the record and clear a few things up.

**On the Past:**

First off everyone knows this mess is really over drama between Zam and the current leadership of Reddit Continuum. Whatever has happened in the past is the past and Zam is no longer in the fleet. 

**On the Current Status of REDdit Alert:**

I took around 6 or 7 months off so many of you may not know me. I was one of the two people that founded this subreddit. I was also one of the original 5 people that created the in game fleet. I was also the one that came up with the name. I thought of the name and then it was voted on. The people of the subreddit chose that name. That is how this fleet was intended to be run from the beginning. This fleet is a democracy not a dictatorship. This is for you guys to have fun. During my absence certain fleet admirals took it upon themselves to rule with an iron fist. Let me be clear, I cannot speak for the Reddit Continuum but in REDdit Alert the position of Fleet Admiral is a ""public servant"" position. We aren't here to rule but to carry out the wishes of the fleet. Policy changes should be run through the subreddit and subject to a popular decision. Obviously that is not how the fleet was being run but I can assure you that any Fleet Admiral who does not conduct themselves in this manner will be asked to step down. Fleet Admiral = Public Servant NOT Ruler!

**On the Divide:**

I do believe that this split hurts redditors. I feel that both fleets are weakened and that we are stronger as a whole than split. I just want to go on the record and say REDdit Alert has done everything in its power to reconcile and bring the fleets back together. I personally extended an invitation to the leadership of the Reddit Continuum. My offer was for them to reunify with REDdit Alert and join our command staff. I did not ask them to play a subservient roll but offered shared leadership of the fleet. In fact, since they are some of the more active and regular fleet members I let them know that I prefer to just take a backseat roll and they would be able to take the reigns of the fleet. I feel that this offer was more than fair. It this point it seems that they have made the decision not to rejoin us and go their own way for whatever reason. REDdit Alert has done all that it can to bridge this gap but unfortunately the Reddit Continuum would prefer to stay independent. Although I do not fully understand this decision I respect it and this is the last that you will see me post on the matter. 

**Message to Leadership:**

While I don't agree with them I recognize their right to form a fleet. No mods are to remove any posts or moderate in a biased manner against Reddit Continuum (note: no mods have done this I just want to make this policy clear). They will be given a fair opportunity to grow. If I find that any mod is removing Reddit Continuum posts that mod will be removed from the subreddit. You don't own the subreddit, none of us do. It belongs to the redditors and they will up and down vote whatever they see fit. 

**In Conclusion:**

If you would like to join the new fleet go right ahead there will be no hard feelings. For anyone that would like to stay I can assure you that you will be pleased with the new leadership. Everyone involved in the drama either stepped down or left for Reddit Continuum. REDdit Alert will be a drama free Fleet from this point on, just a place to hang out with fellow redditors, chat, and have fun, this I promise.

Hello my fellow Redditors!

I'm sure some of you know me, and I'm very sure some of you have no clue who I am. I've played STO since release and have only really enjoyed it 
for the past 6/7 months - basically since I found REDditalert/House of Snoo. Thank you all so very, very much.

In this time I feel I've gained so much out of STO and forged nice friendships with some of you in game. I am in a position now to start to give back to the community, so I present to you;

""Lau'wen's Monthly Zen Giveaway!""

* On the first of each month, I will draw a name and present that person with 1000 Zen. (I will PM you on Reddit asking for your Paypal address and then Paypal you the funds to purchase the 1000 Zen yourself).

* If you would like to enter the draw, please just make a post here and I will add your name to a spreadsheet (once entered you are entered for every draw hereafter, I will not be making a new signup each month, only posts made in this thread will be entered). 

* A RNG (me rolling dice or online RNG) will determine the winner. Deadline for this is month's draw is **SUNDAY THE 31ST OF MARCH**.

* Obviously this is going to work on a fair amount of trust, so, no duplicate Reddit accounts posting, one entry per person and please actually buy the 1000 Zen with the money you receive - I can't MAKE you do this, I'll just be very disappointed if you don't.

* Should for whatever reason I am unable do the giveaway one month due to personal/unforeseen issues, I will alert you all here.

I'll see how this works going forward (maybe adding in a second and third place prize...) - I don't think I have much else to cover. Good luck to all! ",,False,self,t5_2rfq3,1364813523.0,,Delta,True,t3_1anmcj,http://www.reddit.com/r/sto/comments/1anmcj/lauwens_first_monthly_zen_giveaway/,

As most of you probably know, the Leadership trait for boffs was fixed.  I did some testing of this, as I wanted to see if there were diminishing returns.  

Leadership is stated as granting the following: 

* +20% Hull Regeneration
* +20 Subsystem Repair 

Below are my findings and summary (if you don't want to see my boring test results and want the info immediately, skip to the end):

My stats with 0 Human Bridge Officers (however, note that my toon I tested this on is Human):

* Hull repair rate: 101.4%/min
* Starship Subsystem repair: 20

1 Human Bridge Officer:

* Hull repair rate: 118.4%/min
* Starship Subsystem repair: 40

2 Human Bridge Officers:

* Hull repair rate: 135.3%/min
* Starship Subsystem repair: 60

3 Human Bridge Officers: 

* Hull repair rate: 152.2%/min
* Starship Subsystem repair: 80

All other statistics remained unchanged.  To conclude, it appears that the Leadership trait does not result in diminishing returns, as each boff added about another 17% of hull repair rate and 20 subsystem repair.  One thing that I did not understand is why it increased by 17%, as the trait states it should go up by 20% (perhaps someone else reading this may know why that is).  This means that it is perfectly viable to stack your Bridge Officer crew with humans and vastly increase your stats in these two areas, if you so desire.

Edit: I was told by James that Covert Operative/Superior Covert Operative on the Romulan boffs don't have diminishing returns either.  After looking into it, I can confirm this.

This is a new thing that /r/sto will be trying out for the month of August. For each week on monday, I will post one of these megathreads as a weekly opportunity for some of our newer players to ask questions about the game. *This thread will be a troll-free environment, so that anyone can ask a question without backlash.* Negative attitudes will not be tolerated and poor comments/answers will be deleted on sight.

These weekly threads will appear at the top of the submission list for /r/sto until Wednesday afternoon, and also archived in the sidebar for later reference. If you have any feedback, please [send us a mod mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fsto)!

Greetings captains! This thread was created for the sole purpose of aiding those who aren't that knowledgeable about the game by allowing them to freely ask questions and get answers. This place will be a troll-free environment so that anyone can ask a question without backlash. In other words: negative attitudes will not be tolerated.

* Before asking a question, be sure to check out our [**Frequently Asked Questions**](http://www.reddit.com/r/sto/wiki/faq#wiki_frequently_asked_questions) section in the wiki first to see if your question has already been answered.

* If you answer a question, do so in a friendly and comprehensive manner. In other words, be nice and make sure your answer actually answers the question that was asked.

* I highly encourage you to sort the comments by ""new"" rather than ""top"" or ""best"" so that all the questions may be answered, as some people will come late to the thread.

* If you wish to just view top level comments (i.e. only questions) add ?depth=1 to the end of the page url

State of the Fleet is back! I had been very busy with school and work, but with exams done, let's return this weekly write-up!

**Game News** - 

* From now until January 31st, 2013, whenever you purchase an Ultimate Game Card to redeem for Zen, [you get a 15% bonus.](http://sto.perfectworld.com/news/?p=782331)
* Alongside this 15% bonus, [master keys are now 15% off](http://sto.perfectworld.com/news/?p=787141) until December 27th. As well, every lock box is now dropping until the 27th along with the Temporal Lock Box.
* [The Beta of the Gateway is active for the Holodeck!](http://sto.perfectworld.com/news/?p=782551) This lets you, outside of the game, view your ship, boffs, your character and your accolades. This is still in Beta, so there are still some bugs (such as you shuttle appearing even when you're on your regular ship).
* [All Featured Starbase/Embassy Projects](http://sto.perfectworld.com/news/?p=785271) are up for a limited time until January 17th. As the Snoo and RA bases have always kept up with featured projects, we have no need to worry about this. You all rock!
* Until January 14th, [the Episode Rerun event is back.](http://sto.perfectworld.com/news/?p=780341) You can run the following:

* The Devidian Arc - Dwell into the [lower decks of Drozana](http://i.imgur.com/tnEbm.gif) to earn the Ophidian Cane!
* The Reman Arc - Play through the Romulan/Reman arc to earn a Reman bridge officer!
* The 2800 - Reclaim DS9 from a time-displaced Dominion fleet to earn the Shard of Possibilities!
* The Breen Arc - Deal with the Breen and earn a Breen bridge officer!

**Fleet News** - 

- RA has unlocked Transwarp Conduit IV. You can use it to transwarp to any of the Cardassian sectors (including Beta Ursae). Transwarp to the starbase and have your ship approach the transwarp conduit to use it.
- Amazing work to both RA and Snoo for their Starbase progress! All that's left is the minor personnel projects and the long grind to Tier V. Keep it up guys!
- There seems to be some confusion over project assignment in RA. The general consensus appears to be to finish Tier V military first. However, with so many people in our fleet and so many requisitions taking place, to all officers, please keep an eye on the provisions for the base and throw in various provision projects as required. Thank you!
- The major issue with fleet projects right now appears to be dilithium requirements and, to an extent, fleet marks. As Investigate Officer Reports has been changed to only require 1 project every 30 minutes, this is an excellent way to acquire 900+ dilithium and 50 flarks every half hour. Team up with 4 other fleet members to get over 4000 dilithium and 250 flarks in a group. 

**Economic News** - 

- At last check, Dilithium/Zen was around 102 dilithium for 1 zen. At a max refine rate of 8000 dilithium, that equals 78 Zen per day.

**Tip of the Week** - 

Q's Winter Wonderland is here! Let's talk!

There's lots of stuff to do in Q's Winter Wonderland, from events to races to battles, let's start!

When you first arrive at Q's Winter Wonderland, you arrive in a large gazebo. This is the main base where you can access your bank/mail/exchange (via mini Q), start a PVE race with the Breen official, do holiday Epohh missions with the Romulan, trade holiday commodities at the GPL console, trade holiday commodities for holiday items, and access the tailor.

One of the key reasons you're here for though is to acquire the Breen ship! To get it is not an easy task, as the holiday vendor wants 1000 autographed pictures of Q. You can get these by 2 ways: purchase a holiday bundle from the vendor (5 lobi get you 2-6 autographs) or perform the PVE race and receive 40 autographs every 20 hours. 

You should feel honored! [The Great and Powerful Q](http://i.imgur.com/KzqEA.png) has decided to give you a chance to amuse him. 

The PVE race takes you around the map against an NPC opponent. Beware though, the track is very slick and you will slip and slide when you want to turn or stop. Rolling into turns and jumping without moving will assist you along with keeping your cool and jogging at times. It may take a couple of tries at first, but you'll get the hang of it. 

Next is the events. Every half hour the Snowman event starts. You and everybody else on the map will be attacked by snowmen. Grab snowballs from the piles around the map (and equip in your equipment!) and destroy the snowmen with the snowballs. You can also, after you get the commodities, invest in snowball weapons such as the Flurry and Avalanche to aid in the fight. After your zone defeats 150 snowmen, the Snowman Overlord will spawn in the large lake. You must destroy the Overlord (which can also be healed by his Snowman Minions). Once he is destroyed, you will receive some holiday commodities. Fight the Overlord 20 times to get the Snowball Hero accolade/title.

The other event is the PVP race, which is a shorter track located west of the Gazebo. It occurs 4 times an hour and pits you against other players. The track is slightly more difficult than the PVE race as it has ice obstacles and a cliff you jump off of (not the old one used to short-cut) that, at the bottom, has a pit that can be difficult to escape. The prizes for this are Winter Epohh tags that can be turned in to research winter-themed Epohhs (6 tags are required to start a winter Epohh doff mission). When you reach the end, make sure you claim your flag as prizes aren't earned automatically! Even if you don't make 1st, 2nd or 3rd, you're rewarded with 2 winter Epohh tags.

There are a number of accolades to earn -

* Snowman About Town - Locate all intractable Snowman scenes in Q's Winter Wonderland. 
* Ice Racer - Run the PVE race 10 times.
* Fast and the Flurrious - Win the PVP race once or compete in the race 20 times.
* Snowball Hero - Fight against the Snowman Overlord 20 times.
* Snowshoe - Crit an Epohh research doff mission.

Extra Tidbits - 

* Snowball piles randomly reward holiday commodities and Epohh tags.
* Snowballs will melt in your inventory after 1 hour.
* Frosted Boots will let you skate and perform stunts on the large lake.
* If you let a tribble consume a winter-themed food item (available from the holiday vendor), you will get a Winter Tribble (thanks for the correction Thyral!)
* While Q's Winter Wonderland is active, holiday-themed doff missions will be active. Keep an eye out for these missions, as critical successes reward significant amounts of holiday commodities!

Thanks for reading everybody, and see you online!

1353021844.0,24,self.sto,139mp9,Rant: Why KDF and FED should be allowed to Team up at level 50,26,2,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/sto/comments/139mp9/rant_why_kdf_and_fed_should_be_allowed_to_team_up/,"The fact that the Klingons can't join Federation teams at level 50 is dumb.

 * FED vs KDF queues are pathetic due to KDF low numbers.

 * Many KDF missions are just copies of FED missions (Drozana Station Devidian arc, for example).

 * It's anti-fun.  It makes things needlessly complicated and annoying.  Remember how annoying it made queueing for STFs?  Not to mention transferring Dilithium between our two Reddit fleets...

 * If you want a reason to say why you can take a Federation guy on that KDF mission where you blow up Utopia Planitia, say that all ""replayed"" missions take place on a Holodeck.  Our SERVER is even named Holodeck.

 * **Let's look at the in-universe reason:** There is no longer ANY point to the FED-KDF war even existing.  In the storyline *from the very beginning* you learn a shadow force ^*cough*Undine*cough* is manipulating the Klingons and Starfleet into war.  Then you find out through the Romulan and Undine arcs that ANOTHER shadow force are manipulating the Undine!
   * Surely the player-character would bring this information back to Starfleet Command / Klingon High Command, and the farce of a war would end?  Then we could focus on joining together to fight more pressing threats like, I dunno, the Borg?  You'd think the whole ""STF"" thing would spread to the governments.  It's a common trope in literature to have two forces who realize they are manipulated to band together to fight a common enemy.
      * Unless, of course, said Command were Undine themselves (more likely FED, see Fed mission *Divide et Impera* and the fact the FED didn't believe Worf when Worf tried to warn them)
         * So why don't FED root them out?  We know what chemicals are needed for Undine to maintain their form.  Unlike Changelings, they require a constant supply of them.
              * WTF is Section 31 doing about it?
   * There are subplots involving removing war mongers like B'Vat who just want the KDF and FED to fight forever because Survival of the Fittest and all that.  We killed that guy.  Even the KDF thought he was nuts.

I want a sense of movement and progression in the story.  I want to stop seeing ""supply the war effort against the KDF!"" when I'm level 50.  The KDF-FED war is silly.  It should 'end' (environment / NPC dialogue changes) when players progress to Level 50, then they should be allowed to openly Team together ***for kicking Undine butt.***  

Diplomatic Immunity and Raiding Party should make it possible to actually DO things in each other's space.  I want to see us all actually kick some Undine ass and stop fighting amongst ourselves.",,False,self,t5_2rfq3,1353022064.0,,,True,t3_139mp9,http://www.reddit.com/r/sto/comments/139mp9/rant_why_kdf_and_fed_should_be_allowed_to_team_up/,

Welcome to this week's State of the Fleet address. More Season 7 goodies! Season 7 spoilers ahead.

Let's get started. Better late than never.

**Game News -** 

- Apart from Season 7 news, not much to report here, so I'll keep the spoilers in a separate section in case nobody wants to be spoiled.
- This week's Foundry mission is a KDF mission called ""Dead Men Tell No Tale"". You must save the Klingon homeworld from human trickery in the Kahless Expanse! 

**Season 7 Spoilers Ahoy -** 

- [Fleet Embassies are coming!](http://sto.perfectworld.com/news/?p=723801) Revealed in Blog 7, the Starbase-like program expands to include embassies that you build up in tiers. 
- [STF restructure news.](http://sto.perfectworld.com/news/?p=726221) This is a large blog post about how the STF system is changing and moving to Omega Marks. Lots of complex news in this, however, the keys facts are that all current Borg tech will be converted for use after you reach Tier 5 and that all purchases of Borg gear will be done via the new menu. The STF store will be closing down on DS9.
- [News of the Romulan Marks system has been released.](http://sto.perfectworld.com/news/?p=729191) Similar to the Omega Marks system, progressing in the Romulan Marks system grants you access to new instances on New Romulus, passive abilities, and store/equipment unlocks.

- Congratulations to Thala on become a DJ at Subspace Radio!
- Stay tuned for next week's State of the Fleet for another big news item related to Subspace Radio and RA/Snoo!
- RA's Shipyard will be complete in the middle of Tuesday, good work! Once this is complete, Tier IV ships will be available, along with Tier IV military fleet buffs/doffs. Lastly, the Starbase IV project will unlock!
- Progress on RA's Science Tier IV is going along smoothly. After 1 week, we've gone from 75000 experience to 84000. We should be around Tier IV science in about 2 weeks, or when Starbase IV completes.
- Snoo's progress to Tier IV is going smoothly, with science IV expected to be attained first. Keep it up!

**Money Matters -** 

- Current dilithium price for zen is 158 dilithium for 1 zen, or 50 Zen for 8000 Dilithium.
- Prices of Mini-Doff packs have gone up considerably lately (likely due to doff demands on Starbases). Previously acquirable for less than 100k, they're not more expensive, making them more difficult to flip for money.

**Tip of the Week -** 

Did you know we have a Teamspeak server? If you have a mic install the Teamspeak client from [this site.](http://www.teamspeak.com/)

Once you install it, access the channel via the address: T333.DARKSTARLLC.COM:10113

Server password is available in-game from a senior officer or just ask!

Thanks for reading everybody, sorry for the late report! See you all online!

Here we go again, yet another week for State of the Fleet! Busy day yesterday, so this is a day late. Many things to report of this week!

Season 7 spoilers ahoy. Be warned.

Note-Worthy Game Events -

- Season 7 items are now being tested on the Tribble server! This includes the new Omega Reputation system, In The Hive STF and the new 20-man events!
- [The STO Gateway is now active, Tribble-only.](http://sto.perfectworld.com/news/?p=721881) This application allows you to access character details, ship status, boff status and accolades via a mobile platform.
- The eighth Starbase special project has been released, a fish-tank for the Feds and bar items for KDF.
- This week's spotlight on the Foundry is some special green gas project...nah, it's [Relics](http://sto.perfectworld.com/news/?p=722311). You have to investigate a planet occupied by the Klingons, and need to figure out why they are so interested in it.

Season 7 Stuff (**Spoilers ahead**) - 

- [The Romulan Colony Adventure Zone](http://sto.perfectworld.com/news/?p=714451). From Season 7 Dev Blog 3, this adventure zone will allow you to complete a number of daily missions to earn the new Romulan Marks for the reputation system.
- [The Azure Nebula Rescue](http://sto.perfectworld.com/news/?p=721761). A 5-man mission coming soon that pits you and your team against the Tholians while you rescue trapped Romulan ships. This mission rewards fleet and Romulan marks.
- [Chaos in Romulan space is becoming an issue.](http://sto.perfectworld.com/news/?p=723151) Further hints toward more Romulan story progression.

**Season 7 spoilers end.**

Fleet Events -

- Congratulations to REDdit ALERT for achieving Military Rank IV last night! 10 days to the shipyard being available, so we'll have it around Halloween.
- Snoo is going about fleet projects differently than REDdit ALERT, so, for officers, make sure you don't get the two policies mixed up. RA focuses more on one specialty stream while Snoo is doing all three streams at once.
- Congratulations to RA and Snoo for completing the latest starbase special project!
- The turnout at DJ Creamy's show on Tuesday at the Defera ruins was amazing! I hope you all had a great time!
- DJay has set us up a Teamspeak server to meet the increased demand for a voice server. [Connection information is available here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/sto/comments/11oayy/25_slot_teamspeak_3_server_for_reddit_alert/) Contact an RA or Snoo member for the password (done so we don't get randoms).


Money/Business Matters -

- Today's Dilithium/Zen price is 158 Dilithium for 1 Zen, down from 160 for the week. That's 50 zen for 8000 dilithium.
- Key prices have dropped to around 1.35-1.4 million.
- Another reminder to watch your zeroes when you submit something to the exchange. Don't want you guys losing out because of a minor mistake.

Tip of the Week -

This week's tip brought to you by Barbarossa!

Evasive Maneuvers and Engine Batteries are your friends in STFs! With time and big-hitting targets a problem, you want to be able to move fast to get to your next target and to avoid target such as the Gateways in ISE and KASE. Evasive and engine batteries help.

When you're playing ISE, after you finish off one transformer, you have to avoid the Gateway to get to the next one. Use an engine battery and evasive maneuvers to get to the transformer real fast to avoid the extremely powerful weapons of the gateway. 

This is also very helpful when it comes to KASE. If you blitz a gateway (take it down), you want to get to the other side ASAP. Evasive and engine batteries help give you that boost to help your teammate/s on the other side to take down the sphere/probe spawn. 

As well, with evasive, keep evasive unused against Donatra until she uses her Theleron burst. The cone is massive, and if you're pulling her aggro, you want to get out ASAP. 

Thanks for reading, everybody! See you all online!

What his motivation or reason for this is not known. I have taken it upon myself to remove Dantain from Reddit Continuum effective immediately for the infraction.

If there is an @dantain character in your fleet I urge you to remove it or to severely limit his access to your bank.

**EDIT:** I want to say a huge thanks to all of you who have commented here and offered donations. 

**Nearpanic** has offered to replace the entire sum of stolen money. I do not want to seem greedy and put more into RC's coffers at the expense of this great community.  If you folks would like to still donate credits knowing Near's offer, I would still welcome and accept it, but have little to offer except my skills in STFs and a heartfelt thank you.

I have acquired **3 pre-paid 1000 Zen cards**, and I will be giving away the codes on them!  Essentially, if you win I will send you the activated code on the back of the card via in-game mail, which you can then redeem at the STO website.  Sign up below, and you will be entered for the draw.  There will be an in-game gathering for the giveaway May 19th at 3 pm EST!

The only rule I will set is that you can't win more than one card.  Aside from that, you do not need to be in a Reddit fleet.  You do not need to actually be present to win.  And I don't care what you spend it on so long as you enjoy it.  Buy inventory slots? ...Cool!  Use it to manipulate the dil/zen market? ...Excellent!  Buy yourself some Romulan-related stuff?...Sweet!  Use it towards a C-store ship?...Only if it's an escort. (Kidding, of course.)

I felt like doing this for a number of reasons.  Here they are, if you're interested:

1) I got a new job that I'm very excited about for the summer, and felt like celebrating!

2) It's also my birthday this month!

3) As of a couple days from now, I'll have been in REDdit Alert for 9 months.  So you can think of it as I impregnated the fleet back in September, and this is the resulting birth. (Okay, that one weirded me out too.)

4) I recently came into a small sum of liquid assets. (That means I found cash in a pocket of an old jacket.)

5) Because you guys are freaking awesome, and I wanted to celebrate all the good times I've had with the fleet, and the good times yet to come!  It's not much, but I hope you all enjoy.

So, that about does it.  Sign up below!  Win Zen!  Oh, and if anyone wants to send me items to give away or wants to give away stuff at the same time, they are more than welcome (but please, let me know here in the comments if you're sending me items to give away via in-game mail).

**PART 5: BANK RULES**

---

**WITHDRAWING**

1. Take what you need, but don't take everything. If there is only one stack of something, don't take it all for yourself. Taking stuff for your alts is OK.

1. Treat the bank like the ""take a penny, leave a penny"" in gas stations. That is, feel free to take something if you need it, but also try to donate your own, good items that you don't need.

1. Don't take items with the intent to sell them or give them away to non-fleet members.

1. The 24 Hour Dump is the exception to the above. You make take anything in there, and do whatever you wish with it, including reselling.

**DONATING**

1. Only donate rare (blue) and very rare (purple) items to the fleet bank. Exceptions include:

1. Combat support items can go into the Combat Support tab. Overflow goes into the 24 hour dump.

1. The 24 Hour Dump can contain anything that doesn't fit into the other bank tabs, including replicateable commodities that might be useful for new players.

1. In the samples tab, the top row is reserved for Particle Traces. Do not put extra normal samples here. Extras go into the 24 hour dump tab instead.

1. No lockboxes in any of the tabs, ever.

1. Only rare or very rare tribbles may be donated, and should go into the combat support tab, or the 24 hour dump.

**THE REDDIT SHOPPE**

The Shoppe is basically a store, run by the fleet. The idea is to have highly sought after items here, which we will then sell to any fleet members who are interested, at a highly discounted rate compared to the exchange. The items in the Shoppe are donated by fleet members, and the money earned from sales here will be used towards improving the fleet. This can be buying resources to fill fleet projects if we're stuck on a particular one, for competition prizes and so on. The procedure for using the Reddit Shoppe is as follows:

1. See an item you want. Contact an officer who is online at the time.

1. The officer then checks the price on the exchange.

1. You then donate 50% of the market price (ie. if an item is worth 2 million on the exchange, you donate 1 million) into the fleet bank. The first tab in the fleet bank is where you can donate energy credits.

1. The officer checks the bank log and verifies that the money has been deposited.

1. The officer mails or trades you the item.

That's all there is to it. The prices will change on a day-to-day basis, as it follows the exchange, but by charging 50% of normal market price, you're always sure to get a good deal from the Reddit Shoppe. Furthermore, you are also helping out the fleet by basically sponsoring future events and such.",,False,self,t5_2rfq3,False,,Combo,True,t3_187iyh,http://www.reddit.com/r/sto/comments/187iyh/announcement_ra_fleet_rules_part_5_bank_rules/,
1360124292.0,26,self.sto,17zbah,[Announcement] New Inactivity Policy for Reddit Alert.,29,3,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/sto/comments/17zbah/announcement_new_inactivity_policy_for_reddit/,"Greetings all.

Since Reddit Alert hits the member cap on a very regular basis at the moment, we in the officer group have had to revise the fleet's inactivity policy. This new policy is not in being put in place to punish anyone, but rather to clear up space for new active members. The new limit before a character is eligible to be removed is as follows:

* Recruit: 15 days
* Ensign: 15 days
* Lieutenant: 30 days
* Commander: 30 days
* Officer: 60 days

If you know that you're going to be gone for a longer period of time, but are planning on coming back, you can make a note of absence in /r/sto (preferable, as we'll have out-of-game documentation to refer to), or send a tell to an officer in-game. They can then make a note of you being on extended leave and your estimated return time, and we will hold off on removing you until that date has passed.

Should you find that you have been removed for inactivity and want back in (because you're playing actively again), then it's simply a matter of asking for a reinvite. While your previous rank might not be restored instantly, your fleet contribution is saved, and you'll be able to pick up where you left off, more or less.

On behalf of the officers,

I usually play two weeks than give up. This includes Atlantica, LoTR:O, D&amp;D Online, World of Warcraft and DC Heroes and City of Heroes/Villains.

While they were fun, I never really got them. There was a point where the game just got 'too hard' and pushed you to buy stuff to make it easier, or just stopped being fun in the point of Paid Ones.

I've been playing STO for at least 2 months now, that's the longest I've ever stayed in an MMO, /period/.

On top of this, I /get/ this game. I needed a little help at first, but once you understand the basics....it becomes so so so easy....like the other day, I came in First in Starbase 24, with one of my alts (Science Captain/Fed)... with a build of my own revolving around being a Dual Beam Bank boat and some Debuffing. I felt /rewarded/ for once playing an MMO when that little dialog came up. I can EXPLAIN to others how to play this game, I've NEVER been able to do that with another MMORPG.

So just gushing on why I think STO is awesome and why that's important to me. :).

Here we go again, yet another week for State of the Fleet! Lots to report on this week!

Note-Worthy Game Events -

- The 1000 day anniversary of STO is here! [To celebrate, the long-awaited 1000 day ships have been released](http://sto.perfectworld.com/news/?p=706571): the Federation Chimera Class Heavy Destroyer and the Klingon Peghqu' Heavy Destroyer. Alongside the ships, 1000 day vets receive a Starfleet Veteran or Empire Veteran title, a free starship slot, and a Starfleet Veteran or Empire Veteran title for the forums.
- Until November 12th, the lifetime subscription is on sale again for $200. This time, however, there's an added perk: You'll get [every single subscription perk, including the 1000 day ship.](http://sto.perfectworld.com/news/?p=706971) Thanks to DMercenary for the correction, even after the sale, you'll still receive the perks, you just pay full price.
- [Just announced, a change character button is being added to STO so you don't have to log-off to toon.](https://twitter.com/CrypticEQAH/status/256823161033732096)
- Season 7 is expected for launch in November, with the Vesta-class alongside it.
- [Season 7 dev blogs have started!](http://sto.perfectworld.com/blog/?p=709721) A new STF is coming based in Unimatrix 01 called ""Into the Hive"". Only ground photos have been shown.

Fleet Events -

- Another great turn-out at DJ Creamy/Boss' party at the Subspace Radio starbase and DJ Puddytat's ship party. Lots of fun was had!
- As we are very close to Military Tier IV, RA is focusing on military projects. Although other fleets have reached Tier IV military, we're half-way with Tier IV engineering and science, so we're ahead of the wave with those as the Tier IV military fleets are focusing on military more so than engineering and science.
- Although the Terradome run last Saturday ended in failure, there was lots of support for it. We shall have to try it again!
- Snoo's Starbase progress has been running smoothly, one of, if not, the most advanced KDF starbase in the game! Getting close to finishing up Tier IV science.

Money/Business Matters -

- Today's Dilithium/Zen price is 159 Dilithium for 1 Zen, up from 157/158 for the week. That's 50 zen for 8000 dilithium.
- Key prices are stagnant around 1.5 million ec.
- Markets have been over inundated with Starter Packages in the past few days. Worth 300 Zen, a number have been appearing on the exchange for 100,000 ec. If you can get a hold of a cheap one, it's good for reselling or giving to a new toon (good low-level gear, an experience boost, 2 boffs and the ""Academy Graduate"" title).

Tip of the Week -

Minor tip, courtesy of Two of Four, this week we look at buying items in bulk.

A lot of times, when you want to buy something like batteries, commodities, keys, etc. you want to buy in bulk instead of singles. At times, this can be an advantage to you.

Often people will place items in bulk on the exchange for cheaper than what the current price for them is on their own. How do you find these though, with so many different items on the exchange?

If you look at the top left tabs, you can set search criteria. One of the search by tabs is ""Price per unit"". By selecting this option, when you search for an item, the cheapest per unit will appear. Thus, if, say there's single batteries for 200 ec, but a bulk of 20 for 2000 ec is on the exchange, that bulk item will appear at the top of the list.

Warning though - Never use the all tab. It is currently ""broken"" and doesn't list all items when you enter search criteria. Make sure you're selecting specific categories when searching for items!

Thanks for reading, everybody! See you all online!

This setup is geared towards an aggressive playstyle with that can easily reach an average 8000ish dps or [10k dps](http://i.imgur.com/XmlFa.png) if you're good. Anytime you are firing, you want to be using AP Beta (if available), tactical team, scatter volley, and torp spread. Keep the EPtS cycling to keep you safe from minor scrapes and bruises, and Reverse Shield Polarity is your panic button if you piss off something big. Whatever you're shooting at should be [dead before it wears off](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl3IShMrxic&amp;hd=1). Be on the lookout for opportunities for stacking resistance debuffs with your attacks, for example: [Gravitic Anchor](http://www.stowiki.org/Ability:_Gravitic_Anchor) (3/3 omega bonus) makes a nice improvement to your TPDS for some [really impressive spike dmg](http://i.imgur.com/oAZJg.png).

FAQ:

&gt; Why 2 torps/2 torp consoles?

Unless you're point blank to everything you shoot at (which will get you shot at a lot more than you will like), you will have a lot of damage dropoff at 5km. Torps will pickup the slack for ranged targets and the consoles also boost your TPDS. [The majority of my damage done is from torps](http://i.imgur.com/1y7e0.png). Also with less energy weapons, you'll have less drain on your weapon power levels which means you'll squeeze more dps out of your remaining cannons/turrets.

&gt;Why disruptors? Whynot X energy weapons?

After looking at my breakdown of [what weapons did what damage](http://i.imgur.com/1y7e0.png), most of my damage came from my torpedo attacks. Disruptor breach is the only weapon proc that will help me boost this further.

&gt; But Kit! Isn't (random single target ability) moar dps?

In your one cherry picked example, its more dps for about 10 sec. For the other 99.99% of the time you'll have more than 1 thing to shoot at and [AOE abilities come out ahead](http://www.reddit.com/r/sto/comments/zwv0l/estfs_aoe_vs_single_target_burst_vs_sustained/). If you take single target abilities into NWS, you are a dumbass.

&gt; Take a look at the boff skill set I'm using currently. It's been doing well for me and there may be things in there that you like as well.

Does it do more than 8k dps? No? Then why would I want to look at it?

&gt; I see you put skill points in ability X, in my build I have points in ability Y.

That's great, but these are the skill points I use in PVE and PVP. You can move some points around if you like but your mileage may vary.

Please be mindful of Crtptic/PWE's stance on bots and power leveling devices when talking about them in RedditChat. What you do on your computer is up to you, but we don't want to rumors to start about RA or HoS using said ""illegal"" devices.  

There was some talk today (evening for me) regarding using bots, and the leadership of Reddit's fleets wished for this to stop immediately.

Welp, with a little bit of effort, you can raise those little bastids into a never ending supply of Romulan Marks.

Now, there's kind of a long, drawn out process to get Epohhs to raise, so bear with me.

***Part One: What To Expect When You're Expecting To Epohh Farm***

First thing's first: you need four Active Epohh Tags. You get those by completing the daily Epohh Collection mission from Toreth in the aptly named Epohh Fields. You get a minute and a half to tag as many Epohhs as you can. I've gotten around 20 on my own, but really you want to team up with someone so you can get 30 tags and all four Active Epohh Tags.

Once you get four Active Epohh Tags, you'll be able to start a DOFF Mission, ""Help with Epohh Research"". Find a Purple Science DOFF with Efficient and/or Logical, and send them to work.

Twenty four hours later, you'll be gifted with one or three (if you get a Critical Success) Epohh research. Hold on to that. Repeat the above steps until you have five Epohh Research's.

All told, this should take you between two and five days, depending on your luck.

***Part Two: The ~~Doctor~~ Ambassador Spock Method For Raising Epohhs***

So you have your fistful of Epohh Research's. Go talk to Toreth, and open up her Store. Buy an Epohh Pup using your Epohh Research: Forest, River, Mountain, or Ruins. Doesn't matter which. I like River, because they're blue.

Now, there are five Epohh Researchers, corresponding to the four kinds of Epohhs, plus Evolved Epohhs. If you Crit an Epohh Raising assignment, your Epohh will Evolve. As far as I can tell, it grants no bonuses other than having a really smart Epohh or something.

Go to the Epohh Researcher appropriate to whichever Epohh you bought.

All Epohhs start as Pups. You want Epohh Elders. To do this, you need to run three DOFF missions that will move your Epohh from Pup to Moppet, Moppet to Adult, and finally Adult to Elder. You'll need two Science DOFFs with Efficient and/or Eidetic Memory. Start the DOFF mission, go get a beer and a good night's sleep, and come back the next day.

Repeat until you have an Elder Epohh.

***Part Three: Your Empty Epohh Nest***

So you have an Elder Epohh. Nicely done! Time to send him/her/it off to Epohh College or something. Hop on back to Toreth, open up her store, and find whatever type of Epohh it is you've raised.

Select ""400 Romulan Marks"", and turn in your Epohh. Congratulations, you have earned 400 Romulan Marks for doing nothing other than clicking some buttons and running around for two minutes a day for two weeks. 

The best part is, you can raise multiple Epohhs at the same time, and pull in 400-ish Romulan Marks a week.

With all our stuff in there, it's critical to get it tagged before we go anywhere, or we lose *everything* we own. 
     
Even more critically, we're losing our temporary pad on Monday. With her back, shelters are right out; the beds there are.... let's just say they're not good for her back/neck. Right now, we can offer help with food (we're on food stamps) and help around the house as much as she and I can offer. If you'd like, we have a Paypal account to send help to after any verification the mods need (will take about a day, we're using the internet at a local gas station and don't have our paperwork with us) and would appreciate ANYTHING you could do.

1351355120.0,25,self.sto,126e6l,A Treatise on Man-Modes: Blitzing for Dummies,26,1,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/sto/comments/126e6l/a_treatise_on_manmodes_blitzing_for_dummies/,"Are you tired of twiddling your thumbs while you wait for other people to get their generators to 10% in ISE? Do you find yourself snoring in KASE? Does CSE take too damn long? Do you just have too much hair on your chest for your own good? Then read on, because Man-Mode STFs are the thing for you!

* KASE

KASE, by far, is the easiest ESTF to Man-Mode. In all likelyhood, you already have been doing it for a while. Don't stop burning the gates, just blow up the left one, and rush right to deal with spheres. You can, however, help make things go faster if you play defense. For starters, volunteer to handle left probes if you're capable of high DPS with some survivability, and solo the cube on the right transformer of the left gate. Alternatively, if you are feeling frisky, head right with the defender, and take out both cubes and a transformer (possibly both) in advance.

* ISE

In ISE, you can get some crazy numbers if you do Man-Mode. Simply destroying all the generators without waiting on anybody is the way to do it, however, if you're doing over 10k, and you've got people in your group more geared to support, help them on their generators before switching back to your own, but don't ever stop shooting at something. When the gens are gone, park yourself so close to the transformer that you're touching it to maximize DPS. After AoE burning all the spheres down, pop an engine battery and evasive maneuvers to rush to the right side, and do the same.

* CSE

For CSE, you're going to throw that RMMRL/MRRML nonsense out the window. Get one person with either decent DPS or some crowd control abilities, and have them cover the BoPs from the middle and left sides. Everyone else attacks the right probes/BoPs/cube, then shifts middle, doing the same, while taking out middle-spawned raptors. AoE is king here. When a top probe pops and a Negh'var spawns, focus your attacks on it, because you do NOT want an isometric charge ruining your group. You should easily be able to finish with almost 10 minutes left on the clock.


*****DISCLAIMER*****

These all require a few people in the group to have above-average DPS. If you're all pulling 3k (5k for an escort is just as easy as 3k for others), then you can easily make the optional, but maybe not via Man-Mode.

Just did a successful run of the new Vault fleet action. Figured I'll give you guys a heads-up so you know what to expect.

- The Fleet Action is only available during specific hours, like the mirror events.
- The Vault consists of 3 sections - Main entrance, core room and theleron generator room. They are all separated by vault corridors with light resistance.
- At first, you will be given 60 seconds to read the briefing. You won't be able to move in this period of time, it's not a bug. 
- Obisek's ship (a Bird of Prey) can be healed once in the game by an action button. Use this wisely.

- In the first room, it's all about protecting Obisek and disabling 2 power nodes. This is a simple task that can be left to one person while the rest can protect Obisek. Be careful of tractor beams. This is timed, so you must clear the room before the timer stops.
- Once you clear the room, you can move onto the core room, which is significantly difficult.

- The second room will have 4 cores and have constantly respawning Birds of Prey. Ensure you have adequate protection for Obisek. Twice, Obisek will need your assistance to disable two of the cores. A BoP and 2 turrets will spawn at each, so you'll need to work together to get them shut down. This room is also timed and difficult to do (first time running we weren't close to finishing, 2nd time we had about 10 seconds to spare). You must destroy all enemy resistance by the countdown.

- Third room is the theleron generator. Make sure Obisek is protected. The room has everything from Scorpion fighters, BoPs and the boss (a D'Deridex). In the middle of the room is a theleron generator that deploys the same weapon that Donatra uses in Khitomer Accord STFs. It will aim at players attacking the D'Deridex. 

- Obisek will need your help with 1 thing in the third room, but, otherwise, it's protecting him and destroying the D'Deridex. Again, this is timed. Once the D'Deridex is destroyed and Obisek is done disabling the generator, the mission ends and you get a Reman Datalog. 

- The Reman Datalog can be used in doff missions available from the tactical department on your ship.

EDIT - Reman Datalogs are used to build the new Prototype Reman set which consists of, as usual, a shield, deflector and engine. The shield is acquired from the regular Romulan mission.

- It's like a chain to make a better set. You first have to build the rare Mk XI pieces with your tactical officer. Then you give a piece to your engineer to build the rare MK XII pieces. Then you give it to your science officer to build the very rare Mk XII pieces. Rare Mk XII costs 10 datalogs, while Rare Mk XI costs 3 datalogs, so this requires a LOT of playthroughs to get a full Mk XII set.",,False,self,t5_2rfq3,True,,Combo,True,t3_si51i,http://www.reddit.com/r/sto/comments/si51i/the_vault_fleet_action_details/,

1330568272.0,24,self.sto,qcab4,YSK how to gain all the benefits of the best fleets without being in them,31,7,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/sto/comments/qcab4/ysk_how_to_gain_all_the_benefits_of_the_best/,"A large fleet offers many benefits a smaller fleet cannot, however it often lacks an interest in personal investment among all its members.  Fleets that will mass invite anyone without any knowledge of their personality welcomes conflict between people.  Factions form, cliques split, drama happens.  

The smaller fleets on the other hand grow very slowly.  New members are added sparingly and only when members know and like someone.  There's no need for votes on things, because everyone who gathers in the fleet shares a similar mindset.  The feeling between members is that of old friends.  Every time you run something with them, you have fun.

However, most people think that larger fleets are the only way to get what they want:  people who know what they're doing to cooperate with in game activities.  In fact, larger fleets often hoard players who don't know what they're doing yet, and frustrations mount.  It becomes impossible to teach so many people at the same time, and only serves to create more of a divide.  

Truth be told, you can have all the benefits of a large fleet while in one with few members.  This is done through the use of chat channels, of which STO is very diverse.  With them, you can be part of some of the most involved players in the game with the aspects that interest you.  Here's a list of some of the best:



**EliteSTF**  -  Filled with players who run elite stf's and know how to run them well.  They do every one with a strategy, and are looking for people to join them all the time.  A great place to look to fill a small group as well, if only a few from your fleet are available.

**Accolades**  -  For players who like to grind titles and accolades, but hate the solitude of running them.  Group up with others who also like to get them done.

**Dorado**  -  For new players who need help with missions, have questions, or are looking for advice.

**STORP**  -  For players who like to roleplay, and are looking for other roleplayers.  It is an out of character channel allowing you to plan meetups for roleplaying, and still be in a fleet with your friends if you don't roleplay all the time.  

**OrganizedPvP**  -  For PvP players who are sick of losing in PuG's.  

**RedditChat**  -  Allows you to be part of the Reddit community in STO without feeling like you have to be friends with everyone who browses the site.  The best part of Reddit is that you don't have to agree with everyone or be best buddies with everyone.  You can speak your mind, and even in differences still be part of a whole.  This channel lets you keep a loose association without forcing you to watch what you say on Reddit for fear or stepping on toes.  If everyone on Reddit.com hung out IRL, the content would suck.  



I myself am in a small fleet of people who all get along, and have the same level of maturity and humor, likes and dislikes.  I run elite STF's all the time with the help of the EliteSTF channel and am wildly successful.  I RP on occasion and with the help of STORP, I know where other RP'ers are and where to find them.  I PvP often with the help of OrganizedPvP and win most all the games we play, or lose games that are truly epic and not just because I'm stuck with baddies.  I make conversation in RedditChat and feel connected to this site, but am miles away from the drama that comes with the diversity of mind that reddit brings.  

No matter what fleet you're in, find these channels you enjoy and take advantage of them.  And if you find that your fleet suddenly becomes the thing you enjoy the least, don't hesitate to leave it to find one you like.  It is a game, after all.

Many of you are probably wondering what plans the RA leadership have for the launch of the expansion. Since it was announced that Romulans would not be getting their own fleets, we have had to rethink these plans, weighing our options carefully. What we have come to conclude is this:

The Mirror Reddit fleet will be re-tooled into a Romulan Themed fleet, with a new name. It will also be ""promoted"" to a full reddit fleet, rather than an alt fleet. Our main reason for doing this is to give our Romulan players a leg up where starbases are concerned, but to also lend some structure the the whole fleet experience:



* **NAME:**

* The Mirror Reddit fleet will be renamed to something more appropriately Romulan-y. We will resume the name voting that was started a while ago, and let the consensus of our players decide on the name you guys want.

.



* **RULES:**

* The re-tooled Mirror Reddit fleet will use the current Reddit Alert rules in full, although the inactivity and alt policies will not be enforced until we get close to member cap. Two fleets, one ruleset. There are many benefits from this, but simplicity and ease of administration are the main ones. Think of this Romulan themed fleet as a branch of Reddit Alert, rather than a separate entity.

.

* **LEADERSHIP:**

* Keeping administration of the Romulan fleet manageable was our main concern, as we would like to be able to offer you the same kind of leadership here as we do in Reddit Alert. Because of how we have decided to do this, the romulan themed reddit fleet will be led by the existing officer group. Instead of having to work out a new command structure, we will use the current one. This will cut down on the overall administration needed to run both fleets, as they will be treated as one entity by the officer group.

.

* **RANKS:**

* The ranks for Mirror Reddit will be re-done, so that they are the same as in Reddit Alert, and will follow the exact same promotion rules. At first glance, this might seem a bit harsh, but our reasoning for this is because we want the ranks, and therefore the characters, to be completely transferable between the two fleet. If you're an ensign in Mirror Reddit, then you're an ensign in Reddit Alert, and vice versa, with all the benefits that entails. This should also make swapping characters between fleets a lot easier for our members.

* The rank names in the Romulan themed fleet will likely be renamed to something more appropriate, but will retain the same benefits and function as their equivalent Reddit Alert ranks.

.


Our main reasoning for these decisions is one of simplicity. We already have all this stuff in place, and we have officers who are experienced with using the system that we have been using. By keeping things simple like this, the transition should be a lot easier, and our members will know what to expect, both of the fleet, but also of the leadership of said fleet.

* **Q:** **What will happen to the alts I have in Mirror Reddit currently?**
* **A:** Nothing, at least in the foreseeable future. If we get to a point where the re-tooled Mirror Reddit runs out of space, then we will have to start enforcing the alt and inactivity policies, and likely have to make a third fleet for alts. With over 300 open spots in Mirror Reddit currently though, this is not an immediate concern.

* **Q:** **Can I still get new alts invited into the Mirror fleet?**
* **A:** Yes, until such a time when we run out of space, we are not enforcing the alt policy, and you can have as many alts in Mirror Reddit as you'd like.

* **Q:** **Will the re-tooled fleet be for Romulans only?**
* **A:** No, while it will be Romulan *themed*, all fed characters will still be welcome.

* **Q:** **I signed up to be an officer in that thread on r/sto. Are you going to make me one?**
* **A:** If deemed necessary, we will add more officers to the officer group. Bear in mind though, that when you become an officer, you do so for both fleets, and that we expect a high level of activity and dedication to the fleet. As of the time of writing this, we are not planning on adding any further officers, but we are constantly keeping an eye on how things are going, and whether we need more people for officer work or not.",ANNOUNCEMENT,False,self,t5_2rfq3,False,linkflair-announcement,Combo,True,t3_1e0q53,http://www.reddit.com/r/sto/comments/1e0q53/announcement_reddit_fleets_in_the_lor_expansion/,

**FSMs GIVEN OUT - You will receive an ""FSM Contest WINNER!"" in-game mail if you won!**

Hey everybody!

Just a heads-up that our big FSM contest will be occurring tomorrow! [The thread to join the contest is still open and linked here](http://www.reddit.com/r/sto/comments/1bvfr2/fleet_ship_module_giveaway/), and will be until 9 PM EDT tonight, at which point Lucien will be pooling the names. 

Currently, we're at 50 FSMs, but we will likely purchase some more FSMs with fleet funds and will accept donations until 9 PM EDT as well. Final count will be done at that time and I will notify Lucien of the final number of winners to select.

The winners will be announced in a ceremony on the REDdit ALERT Fleet Starbase around 7-8 PM EDT on Saturday. As the base has a presumed capacity of 75, it will be first-come, first-serve for space (unless any devs who read this are able to circumvent that? *hint hint*). You do not have to be online or present to win, all winners will be announced and mailed (unless you're present to receive it).

If you wish to join us on the fleet starbase and are not in the fleet, notify RedditChat for a base invite. Cookies and tribbles will be served.

Good luck to you all, and see you online!

The decision to remove the dilithium rewards from STFs is unacceptable, but what's even more appalling is the way Cryptic went about carrying out this decision.  Guy's, we've been lied to.  We were told that dilithium rewards for STFs would be reduced to 960 for completing an elite run, down from 1100.  Most of us were okay with that.  Then season seven went live, and we found that the [dilithium rewards had been removed completely without warning](http://www.reddit.com/r/sto/comments/135s2a/season_7_dev_blog_17_dilithium_oh_boy/).  No line in the patch notes; no dev blog; not even so much as a rumor on the forums.  I don't know about you guys, but I really don't like it when I'm stabbed in the back and lied to.  So, I'm proposing that Reddit Alert and the House of Snoo begin a boycott.  If you have a gold account, drop it to silver.  Don't buy anything from the C-store or put any money what-so-ever into this game.  Be civil in the comments; we know the devs check out r/sto and no body will give us a serious ear if we pick up the pitch forks and torches, so keep the frustration venting in an adult manner and hopefully the devs will listen when we tell them that not only is this change a mistake, but they way they went about it was unprofessional and a complete snub to their customers.

**EDIT**:  In light of this recent [tweet](https://twitter.com/Cryptic_dStahl/status/268827702881042432) from Dan Stahl and the [updated dev blog](http://sto.perfectworld.com/news/?p=747851) that states that dilithium will be returning to STFs, I'm withdrawing my support for the boycott.

If you talk to the doff mission Reman (the guy with the funky huge industrial goggles) on the REDdit ALERT dilithium mine, a third mission has been added: Dilithium Ore Refining Assignment.

If you have refined your maximum dilithium for the day and have an extra 500 unrefined ore available, talk to the mining foreman and he'll give you the Dilithium Ore Refining Assignment doff assignment. In a few seconds, you'll be able to turn that 500 unrefined to 500 refined.

If you're not in RA and wish to partake in this project, contact somebody for a dil mine invite! This project should be available (if not already) with RSE and Snoo soon as well.

Enjoy your extra dilithium!

1375222031.0,25,self.sto,1jdo1z,STO Review. My perspective after 1.5 years.,45,20,68,http://www.reddit.com/r/sto/comments/1jdo1z/sto_review_my_perspective_after_15_years/,"The main appeal of STO (to me) is the obvious one, it's Star Trek, and there aren't a lot of Star Trek games. That was enough for me to try the game when it first went F2P, and since then I've maintained a number of different characters and tried out the Romulan expansion. 

Total Biscuit has a term that he uses for this type of gaming, I believe he calls it hostage gaming, where people support a game that isn't very good because they want a game like that, and are willing to overlook some of it's faults because of it. Admittedly, at first, things seemed pretty swell. The campaign was quick and relatively painless, the progression was satisfying, and the game seemed to offer a good variety of Star Trek like gameplay with an obvious emphasis on combat. By the time I leveled to 50 I was having a good time, and I quickly went back to create other characters of different classes to try out different aspects of the game. Soon, these were all leveled up too. I then went through the endgame grind to obtain the requisite gear that I needed to make my ships worthwhile contributors to PVE, and eventually PVP. I won a Jem'Hadar attack ship and worked tirelessly to outfit it with all the ridiculously priced purple consoles it could handle. I ground through the reputation systems and the ""adventure zones"". And after all that, not surprisingly, it's hard to say that it was worth it.

I've recently taken stock of how much money I have spent on Star Trek Online and realized that for that amount I could have tripled my Steam library. Now, some you might not spend any money on STO so that point doesn't really strike you. Personally, among my friends that is not the case. They universally say that they have spent far more than they intended on STO, typically more than on any other game ever, and certainly far more than it deserves. Why does it not deserve this? Because it's flat out not a very good game.

The best example of this has to be PVP. I spent an incredible amount of time and money building my attack ship up so that it could compete in PVP, but after actually doing PVP I'm amazed that I even bothered. My win ratio is pretty decent because I'm well equipped, but that doesn't make it any more fun. You don't have true three dimensional movement in space, so you spend half of every match spinning in a circle (corkscrew) because you can't go straight up or down and the maps are broken and everyone always hides at the top. With some few exceptions where two high level ""pre-made"" groups are going at it or where a pug group just comes together, there's very little to the tactics of it either. You all concentrate fire on one target, cycle through your abilities as fast as you can over and over again until they blow up, then do it again. And again.

The worst thing about STO is the obvious cynicism behind it. Other companies might produce more content for you to explore with your characters, but STO just keeps trying to sell you new ships to do the same old nothing in. Every aspect of the game play is corrupted by the pay to win mechanism. Half of the abilities can only be bought through consoles and the balance is laughable. Lately, seemingly every new ship that is released is dramatically superior to the ones that came before it. Is there some reason why only the Andorians would think to put five front weapon slots on their escorts? Let's not even discuss the Scimitar.

This cynicism also conflicts with the whole Star Trek theme park experience. Want to fly a proper Federation ship? Go ahead, but all of them were designed in the previous regime and they generally don't stand up to the new C-Store or lock box ships, or even the ships of other factions. As someone who likes role playing games, it bugs me that I essentially have to fly my Jem'Hadar attack ship or the Andorian escort because all the Federation escorts are dramatically inferior. Cruisers, which have been mostly the focus of Star Trek, are essentially useless, although at least they are durable.

I wouldn't resent STO so much if it hadn't asked for so much. But it demanded that I spend all this time leveling up it's systems and endlessly repeating the repeatable missions. It demanded that I log in everyday to flip over ""reputation projects"" that are as exciting as filling out a work order and to ensure that my fleet doesn't kick me out for being inactive. It required that I spend money to reallocate my skill points even though they have already made more money off me than any game ever has. Every single console on my ship is a considerable ""investment"" of time and / or money, the total amount of which is staggering when you really think about it. All that for lackluster repeatable missions in a broken engine and dreadful PVP.

Last, but not least, STO is a buggy mess of a game with horrible customer support. Half of the time, basic things like tool tips don't even work. Red Alerts haven't worked since I started playing a year and half ago. Even the login screen bugs out every second time. Some of my characters eye color is bound to parts of their uniform, and so on and so on.

Part of this is that I have realized I do not want to play MMO's at all anymore. I don't want to commit the time. I don't want to feel that I ""have"" to log in everyday. Gaming shouldn't be a chore or an obligation. It's supposed be recreational. I shouldn't have to spend hundreds of hours grinding in order to play a decent competitive match. If fact, from now on any game with the word grind associated with it is going to come under serious scrutiny. And I certainly don't want whatever success I do have within game to be contingent upon spending more money than the other dude.

So, in conclusion, STO is a middling MMO with poor content, unethical business practices and a sloppy technical foundation. If you were considering trying STO out I would strongly encourage you not to bother, in the same way I would discourage you from giving money to a pyramid scheme. Some of you, no doubt, really enjoy STO and I don't begrudge you for that. But, if quality in games is important to you, if you want to be able to expect more from the games you play, then I would encourage you not to reward companies like Cryptic, which produce a crappy product whose only purpose is to suck from the teet of the franchise, it's fans and the gaming community as a whole.

It has three sections which take place on an Undine  replica of DS9. You first wipe out a bunch of Undine. We had no problems there. The second part had us running around the promenade, looking for 10 NPCs that distinguished themselves by flipping coins. This part could *really* use some work, as the coin flipping is often not easily visible. Our group sat and watched one area for over five minutes, with nary a coin-flip in sight. Annoying, to say the least. This was pretty bad, but it wasn't the worst...    
   
The third section had us defending 5 terminals as NPC engineers attempted to 'hack' the terminals. We missed it the first time (the engineers got killed), and had to restart the ground section. Two terminals finished, but on the other three, the engineers refused to budge from their starting positions. *The mission was literally impossible to complete at that point.* We didn't go back for a third try; we were frazzled after having spent an hour fighting Undine and staring intently at NPCs for a subtle action that apparently only happened once every 3+ minutes.     
   
To add injury to insult, at least 3 of us found that our BOFF stations had (for no reason apparent) been reset to null (there goes our trays) after exiting. &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;

As some of you know, this past wednesday hasn't been easy for me. My girlfriend decided to end things between us, mere weeks after our 2 year anniversary.

I would especially like to thank M'Ky and Black Jack for going above and beyond the call of duty and spending time both talking to me in private and looking after me later on. But every single one of you is helping me go through this.

So in the wake of this announcement for the new Romulan faction, there are some things that I think need to be discussed.  While this may seem a little early I think it’s good we get these together sooner than later.

1) We need to formally select a name, and we need some sort of process to decide.  I know ReD’Deridex is the frontrunner but I think it might be a good idea to formalize it with some sort of poll.

2) While we're at it with the name, I think we should also pick a motto.  Personally, I’d like to throw “It’s a fleeeeeeeet!” into the ring.

3) Probably the most important thing here, we need to decide on the leadership of the new fleet.  Because this has not really happened before, we probably want some sort of system to decide who the Fleet Admiral(s) will be.  I don’t know about you guys, but I think it’s smart to select at least more than one.  Here are some ways we could go about this:

a) People carry over their rank from either REDdit Alert or House of Snoo (ex. if you’re say, a Commander in RA, you’ll be a Commander in the Romulan fleet).

b) We could set up some sort of poll/election to decide the leadership.  If we choose this option, do we want to restrict who can run in any way?  (ex. You must have been in RA or Snoo for a certain amount of time to run, or must be a certain rank to run.)

c) We could just let whoever wants to be an officer, and has demonstrated commitment to another Reddit fleet, take an officer position.

d) We could let the officers of RA and Snoo decide internally.

I’m not attempting to endorse any one of these options, I just think it’s a good idea to put these out there.  So, let the discussion begin: what do you guys think?

Edit: I see a lot of people wanting to discuss the name of the fleet here.

Time for another edition of State of the Fleet by your friendly^^^^^Andsomewhatcrazy Fleet Admiral! 

Season 7 approaches, so the news continues!

This edition of the State of the Fleet is dedicated to those affected by Hurricane Sandy. We wish all of you the best and a speedy recovery!

If you observe Daylight Savings Time, don't forget to turn your clocks back tonight! 

**Game News** - 

- For this weekend only, sign onto Tribble for an hour and you'll receive a testing gift once Season 7 goes live. The gift has yet to be revealed (wouldn't be surprised if it's a tribble).
- [Duty Officer Pack Promo](http://sto.perfectworld.com/news/?p=738741) is up. In 2 weeks (until November 15th), the reinforcements doff pack will be retired, but before then, a promo is occurring. You now have a chance to, alongside the previous other bonuses (such as the Tuffli), you can get a Jem'Hadar bug ship!
- [Q's Winter Wonderland](http://sto.perfectworld.com/news/?p=739981) is returning for this holiday season. As well, minor details have been revealed regarding the 3rd Anniversary, specifically that it will involve it's own featured episode. Season 8 details will begin around February.
- [Starbase Featured Project 9 is out!](http://sto.perfectworld.com/news/?p=738521) For Feds, you get Morn at the bar and some Latinum traders (non-interactive!) while the lucky KDF get Morn and some Orion dancers on the ""platform"".
- This week's Spotlight on the Foundry is [Left to Die.](http://sto.perfectworld.com/news/?p=739691) You and your crew must investigate the gruesome demise of the USS Romero.

**Season 7 Spoilers** - 

- [Details regarding the 20-Man Mine Trap mission have been released.](http://sto.perfectworld.com/news/?p=731371) Specifically, the salt creatures from M-113 are featured in this mission.
- [Vesta details have been revealed!](http://sto.perfectworld.com/news/?p=738141) Long-awaited, it is a series of 3 ships (tac/eng/sci) similar to the Odyssey trio.

**Fleet News** - 

- As promised from last week, a major announcement. This Tuesday November 6th at around 7 PM EDT, on Subspace Radio, REDdit ALERT and Snoo will be participating in a fleet chat where we are interviewed about our fleet and other random items. Tune in around then and listen in at www.subspace-radio.net
- As usual, you all have blown all expectations with this week's fleet project, with both RA and Snoo finishing the project almost immediately. For the Feds, enjoy sitting and talking with Morn while the KDF....well....let your imagination run wild.
- RA has completed filling Starbase IV, with completion in about 6 days. With the current progress on science projects, we should be able to start Science Tier IV by the time Starbase IV completes. 
- For RA members, do note that Rare Tactical doffs and Tier IV tactical buffs are now available on the starbase.
- Skol, however you got to over 3 million fleet credits, you magnificent bastard, congratulations. :P
- Snoo Croo, keep up the good work! Although other fleets have achieved Tier IV items, you have consistent progress which keeps you ahead of everybody (with a focus on science). 

**Economic News** - 

- At last check, dilithium was around 157 (haven't checked it today). That's 50 zen per 8000 dilithium.
- With the reinforcements pack promo on, more Tufflis have been entering the exchange causing an inflation. I've been seeing a lot around 18 million, so now may be a good time to pick one up for ec.

**Tip of the Week** - 

Gonna keep this one simple and sweet. TRIBBLE BREEDING!

Sure, you get a common Tribble easily in missions, and you get a nifty few second buff with them, but how do you get those special tribbles that give you longer buffs of your choice? 

As you should know, Tribbles LOVE food and reproduce on their own. The game holds true to this, place a Tribble in your inventory or bank with a food item and it produces a new Tribble. 

[Use this fancy/dancy flow chart to get the Tribble of your choice!](http://www.stowiki.org/images/1/1c/Tribble_Breeding_Chart.png)

Thanks for reading everybody, and see you online!

Here are the instructions provided along with these mods:

&gt;The wtex files are the native texture format used in STO they pose no thread at all. The zips contains wtex and txt files, unless I point out that there is an executable in the zip.
The wtex-es work the following way:
There is a Localdata folder inside your Star Trek Online\Live folder. That localdata is an active directory. Which means, if you copy something there the game will try to load it into the game.
The replacement file have to have the same filename and the same folder location as the original file. Use a different name or different location and the file will not be loaded for replacement.
Also the replacement file has to have the same file type. You won’t be able to load up a JPG even if you rename it to wtex.

&gt;You need to extract the content of the texture zips into your Star Trek Online\Live\Localdata folder, otherwise the mod will not work.

&gt;To remove the mod all you need to do is to remove the files, extracted from the zip, from your Star Trek Online\Live\Localdata folder. Earlier I advised to delete the enitre folder, but since there are more mods, if you delete the entire Texture_Library folder, you practically remove every mod.


&gt;These mods DO NOT change or modify any core files. So you don’t have to keep a secondary copy of the game files. If you want to remove every mod and go back to vanilla STO you need to delete everything from your Star Trek Online\Live\Localdata folder.

&gt;These mods are CLIENT SIDE ONLY! This means, you see the colorful LCARs on your computer only. The others will see the same blue LCARs on their computers.

&gt;Now about patching. The files in the localdata folder have the precedence over the data in the hoggs. That is the reason patching should not be a problem. However, there are 2 things that should be considered.
- If a patch changes a file that you mod in your localdata, you will not notice anything, since the localdata file is used. For example, if the devs replaced the mouse cursor today, I would not notice that at all, since my modded cursor is loaded by default. I would only see the patched cursor after I removed the modded cursor.
- If a patches changes the name or the location of a file, the mod would cease to work. The mod file has to be re-named/re-located to start to work again.

&gt;When you add a new mod, you would need to restart STO.

&gt;The client checks all the mod files when you launch the game. This means they will not cause crash during game. If a file is bad in any way, the client will crash right after the launch. 

Here's what I've got for you guys:

[Double-size, Golden Cursor](http://www.almost1337.com/STO/stocrd.zip)

[Animated, color LCARS textures](http://www.almost1337.com/STO/colorlcars_anim.zip)

[Colored power buttons](http://www.almost1337.com/STO/color_powers_b.zip)*

Just a heads-up that we will be having a major celebration tomorrow (Thursday July 25th) at DS9 Quark's. All are welcome, but will be first-come first-served due to instance capacity.

So what's the party about? It's a secret, but there will be numerous announcements, and they're all good!

So rev up STO at 8 PM EST tomorrow and come to Quark's for celebrations galore and Dabo!

1369801390.0,21,self.sto,1f900s,Addressing the REDdit ALERT Fleet Capacity Issue,21,0,40,http://www.reddit.com/r/sto/comments/1f900s/addressing_the_reddit_alert_fleet_capacity_issue/,"Greetings everybody,

Today, we had a few community members who wished to join REDdit ALERT. Unfortunately, even with our inactivity policy, our memberbase has been so active that we won't have anybody falling under the inactive period for around a week, and that is if they do remain inactive for this week.

So this leaves us with an issue of capacity. We had a similar issue with S7 came out but overtime, as the initial hype died down, fleet capacity problems diminished. We expect this to be the same over the next month or two.

In the meantime, we ask the following:

1) As Reddit Star Empire and RA share ranks, officers and rules, feel free to join Reddit Star Empire (RSE) until there is room on RA. We, the officers, place a join date as a note when you join so you won't be reset for time when you are eligible to rank up. We can also make a note about your contributions to RSE to transfer to RA.

2) I am instigating a temporary ban on adding alts into the fleet for Commanders and officers until such a time that the fleet capacity issue simmers down. Feel free to add your alt/s to RSE in the meantime.

We, the officers of RA, apologize to anybody that this affects. Our fleets have exploded in popularity with the introduction of S8 and, unfortunately, a 500 fleet member limit really limits us. We are currently one of the largest, if not the largest, of all communities in STO, and we only want to be the best for all of you. Alas, when a spot comes up and you have a toon in RSE than you originally wanted in RA, contact an officer and we'll make the switch!

Thank you very much for your understanding!

1365294759.0,21,self.sto,1btr7p,Tracking aux2batt power changes,21,0,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/sto/comments/1btr7p/tracking_aux2batt_power_changes/,"For this experiment I sought out to record and examine exactly what happens to a ship's power levels when running an auxiliary to battery setup. It occurred to me that there's some confusion about how it works (not to mention I wanted to know the details myself), so I parked my ship in a Deep Space Encounter for an hour while I timed the results and scratched my head. What I found was quite surprising. 

[*For an aux2 batt setup to work correctly, you need three purple technician duty officers. These doffs boost aux2batt's (also known as a2b, aux2batt, or ATB) innate passive ability, which allow a single bridge officer's skill to cool down as if there were two copies. I equipped these three technician doffs for this experiment. I should also note the second of aux2batt's benefits is the power boost it gives to weapons, shields, and engines when activated. This power boost is what the experiment was designed to track.*]

So...for simplicity's sake, I decided to record the time &amp; power boosts of EPTA1, ATB1, and EPTS1. It's probably the most commonly used setup and is also quite useful, I've found. I reset my power settings to 50/50/50/50, which in my ship is actually 63/71/71/63. 

The raw data is below. 

| time of skill activation | W/S/E/A power level| skill activated|  power boost given to W/S/E/A |
| ------------- |-------------|-------------|-------------|
|--:--|63/71/71/63 (baseline)		|	|
|00:00|63/71/71/82 |EPTA1	|---/---/---/+20|
|00:01|92/101/101/4 |ATB1	|+29/+30/+30/---|
|00:12|65/73/73/82 |ATB1 	||
|00:16|63/90/71/82 |EPTS1	|---/+27/---/---|
|00:22|92/120/101/5|ATB1	|	+29/+30/+30/---|
|00:32|63/90/71/82 |EPTA1	|---/---/---/+20|
|00:33|70/98/79/63|ATB1	||

As you can see, EPTA1 gives a power boost of +20 to auxiliary (descriptions says +19 for 30 seconds). ATB1 gives a boost of roughly +30 to weapons, shields, and engines (descrip says +22.1 for 10 seconds). For some reason EPTS1 gives a boost of +27 to shields (descrip says +19 for 30 sec). Even after power was flushed from auxiliary to everything else (i.e. - battery, not to be confused with ship devices), auxiliary power levels gradually recovered after a while and increased to the level set by EPTA1. 

What's interesting is that the second ATB1 didn't boost anything at all. This is due to the fact that there is virtually no power in auxiliary to send to the other three power reserves. At first glance of the chart, it may seem like the second ATB1 causes a power decrease, which is not true....it's just an indicator that the first ATB1 wore off (it only lasts 10 seconds). 

So what does this all mean? You can get a nice power boost to W/S/E by using auxiliary to battery, but it only lasts for ten seconds. You have to wait *another* ten seconds for your auxiliary power to climb back up for your third ATB1, which will give you the same boost as the first. Again: you only get an aux2batt boost on every other auxiliary to battery activation; at all other times, W/S/E power will drop back to their baseline settings. However, don't think this means you don't need to chain aux2batt, because it still needs to be activated constantly for skill cooldown reduction. 

This fluctuation between ATBs will be less evident in most ships, as I'm sure everyone has weapon power set to 100. It never hurts to have a little extra pew pew power, especially with the aid of ship gear like the [Assimilated module](http://www.stowiki.org/Omega_Adapted_Borg_Technology_Set#Assimilated_Module) (+5 to weapons). 

Well, there you have it. That's what happens to your power levels when you run aux2batt. Hooray, I'm a nerd. 

**TL;DR** aux2batt will really bring out the blue in your eyes.

**&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; EDIT &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;**

As detailed in [the comment below](http://www.reddit.com/r/sto/comments/1btr7p/tracking_aux2batt_power_changes/c9aiwya):to maintain a more consistent Auxiliary power level, activate ATB first and follow it with EPTA. Use three ATB in between each EPTA. 

Also, use [EPS flow regulators](http://www.stowiki.org/Console_-_Engineering_-_EPS_Flow_Regulator) if you want your auxiliary power to recharge quickly. Many thanks to Karth and Saber for the tips.

* [Plasma-Disruptor Hybrid Beam Array](http://www.stowiki.org/Plasma-Disruptor_Hybrid_Beam_Array)

* [Polarized Disruptor Beam Array](http://www.stowiki.org/Polarized_Disruptor_Beam_Array)

All three of these get the bonus from the [Disruptor Induction Coil	](http://www.stowiki.org/Console_-_Tactical_-_Disruptor_Induction_Coil) allowing for minimal to no DPS loss. In theory I could be procing on each broadside salvo:

* 2.5% chance to cause -10% Damage Resistance for 15 seconds, 
* 2.5% chance to lower the target's power levels by 25 for 5 seconds.
* 2.5% Chance: 171 Plasma Damage
* 2.5% Chance: Disable 1 Subsystem for 5 sec

* [Plasma-Disruptor Hybrid Beam Array](http://www.stowiki.org/Plasma-Disruptor_Hybrid_Beam_Array)

* [Plasma-Disruptor Hybrid Beam Array](http://www.stowiki.org/Plasma-Disruptor_Hybrid_Beam_Array)

* [Plasma-Disruptor Hybrid Beam Array](http://www.stowiki.org/Plasma-Disruptor_Hybrid_Beam_Array)

* [Borg Omega Plasma Torpedo Launcher Mk XII [Dmg]x2 [CrtH]](http://goo.gl/5EC20)


**Aft Weapons:**

* [Borg Kinetic Cutting Beam Mk XII [Dmg]x3](http://goo.gl/Srhqn)

* [Plasma-Disruptor Hybrid Beam Array](http://www.stowiki.org/Plasma-Disruptor_Hybrid_Beam_Array)

* [Plasma-Disruptor Hybrid Beam Array](http://www.stowiki.org/Plasma-Disruptor_Hybrid_Beam_Array)

* [Wide Angle Quantum Torpedo Launcher](http://www.stowiki.org/Wide_Angle_Quantum_Torpedo_Launcher)

&gt; Full Build [here](http://redd.it/15ztju)

What I'd like is:

**Fore Weapons:**

* [Spiral Wave Disruptor](http://www.stowiki.org/Spiral_Wave_Disruptor)

* [Plasma-Disruptor Hybrid Beam Array](http://www.stowiki.org/Plasma-Disruptor_Hybrid_Beam_Array)

* [Polarized Disruptor Beam Array](http://www.stowiki.org/Polarized_Disruptor_Beam_Array)

* [Borg Omega Plasma Torpedo Launcher Mk XII [Dmg]x2 [CrtH]](http://goo.gl/5EC20)


**Aft Weapons:**

* [Borg Kinetic Cutting Beam Mk XII [Dmg]x3](http://goo.gl/Srhqn)

* [Spiral Wave Disruptor](http://www.stowiki.org/Spiral_Wave_Disruptor)

* [Polarized Disruptor Beam Array](http://www.stowiki.org/Polarized_Disruptor_Beam_Array)

* [Wide Angle Quantum Torpedo Launcher](http://www.stowiki.org/Wide_Angle_Quantum_Torpedo_Launcher)

What I'm not completely sure about is whether or not by doing this I would be just weakening the procs overall so having three meh ones as opposed to one great proc. In theory you could get the Polarized Distruptor with 2x [Acc], the Spiral Waves have 2x [Acc] already, and the Plasma-Distruptor has +7.5% Acc, so not as great as the other two but not bad. Part of my thinking is that as a Tank there's no way in hell I'm ever going to be DPS champ, but if I can proc several different things on my target (or several targets with FAW) I can aid the team even more than just soaking up damage like a sponge.

Personally I think this would be a terrifically fun build that's a little bit different than just one type of beam array. With this set up you've got four different color beams coming out, with no loss of DPS! Thoughts?

Edit: Also from what I've seen from basic research is that you can only proc on a target one of each type (such as if you've proc'd to disable the subsystem, you have to wait until 5 seconds to try to proc again) so this provides the additional benefit of not just hitting the target and waiting for the proc to finish, you can hope to proc something else as well!

Edit 2: Also looking at the various weapon modifiers:

* CrtD: +20 Critical Severity
* CrtH: +2% Critical Chance
* Acc: +10% Accuracy
* Dmg: +X Damage

Yes by using hybrid weapons I'm losing another one of these modifers. But this goes back to being a tank. More crit severity or chance or damage isn't going to make that much difference, I'm not doing much. But another weapon type proc is more useful. Sure another [Acc] would be nice, but do we really need [Acc]x3? I think [Acc]x2 should be enough for PvE. There is the downside that the Plasma-Disruptor Hybrid Beam Array is only a Rare Mk XI, so it deals a bit less damage and only has +7.5% Accuracy compared to the others, hence why I'd only run one of them.",,False,self,t5_2rfq3,1362685307.0,,Delta,True,t3_19uyx0,http://www.reddit.com/r/sto/comments/19uyx0/a_good_rainbow_cruiser_or_a_study_in_abusing_dual/,

Easiest way is to win the PvP race (Hint: Go to a instance with low amount of people racing; I've been in races with just once other person. Coming 1st, 2nd, or 3rd nets you quite a lot of Epohh tags). You can also dig in the snow piles to get tags. You need 6 or more Tags for the next step. 

2. Once you have the Epohh Tags go to the Researcher where Q is. 

3. Start the Doff mission""Research Tagged Epohh"" (the Winter version and the one in New Romulan is different and are separate missions). Try to increase the crit chances so you get one with a Bow or Earmuffs and hopefully an adult epohh.

4. Once you run the above mission continue raising it until it's a Elder.

5. Once you have an Elder (hopefully one with a Bow or Earmuffs) go to the GPL Conversion Unit -&gt; Store -&gt; Winter Epohh Trade In. 

6. Exchange the Elder epohh for 100 or 200 Romulan Marks. The epohh with a bow or a Earmuffs get 200. 

This is a very easy way to make enough Rom Marks without having to grind them via PvE missions. 

I just finished Tier III just by getting the Rom Marks from the Winter event. I also got the Zero Point console (500 Marks). Currently have 1300 marks to spend. 


edit:

Note: Also do the same thing with the Epohh mission in New Romulan. I believe the Elders there give 400 Rom Marks. Not in STO right now so can't check.

After running an almost perfect Starbase Fleet Defense fleet action just now, a write-up would seem to be helpful to get everybody on the same level with how it works.

This is a new fleet action (20 people) involving the defense of your starbase against hordes of attacking fleets (similar to the 5 man starbase defense mission, but larger and with objectives). The more successful you are, the more fleet marks you get.

This works best with full teams. Make sure you communicate via the team chat and RedditChat over who's doing what. You need to work together as a team to defend the starbase and outposts. 

- Before the match begins, assign teams to either North, East, South or West. These are the areas each team must protect. Because the first freighters have names such as ""Alpha Group"" assign those as well to prevent direction confusion.
- The first objective is to protect freighters as they go toward the perimeter (there's one group for all north, south, east, west, hence why you need teams assigned). Once you approach the outposts on the perimeters, enemy forces warp in (2 waves) that you must defeat. Give the freighters tactical teams to help their protection against the enemy forces.
- Once all enemy forces are dealt with, fall back to the Starbase. Enemy forces will warp in in great numbers.
- Alongside defeating the forces, keep a close eye on the Starbase. Assigning some ships to keep the starbase healed (Via transfer shield strength, AuxtoSIF, Tactical team, Engineering team, etc.) is extremely helpful. Always keep an eye on the starbase even when on the attack to make sure the base remains intact.
- Once these hordes are defeated, enemy waves will attack the outlying outposts. Go to the outpost on your specific compass direction (North, south, etc.) and defeat the hordes and  prevent sabotage. The less damage the outposts sustain, the more fleet marks you get.
- Final wave requires you to return to the Starbase where flagships will warp in with escorts. Defeat the flagships in your specific compass direction (4 groups beam in, north, south, etc.).

That completes the fleet action. Your progress determines your fleet marks.

Team work and communication is key in this. Make sure you know where you have to go and you will do well!

1335635187.0,23,self.sto,sx076,How To get a D'Kora for around $50,27,4,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/sto/comments/sx076/how_to_get_a_dkora_for_around_50/,"So i know a lot of you guys are buying keys trying to get this D'kora ship. 
So I'm gonna break down how i got my D'kora for $50 and a few days of work.

**Step 1**

* Buy $50 of Cryptic Points
* Dont buy keys with these points.

**Step 2**

* Exchange your ~4200 Cpoints for dilithium. I've found the best time do exchange your dilithium for Cpoints is around 9 PM PST. This is when the most people are playing the game, thus the exchange rate is usually (or has been lately) around 310 per cpoint.

* Do the Math. Say you converted 4200 Dilithium for 310 Dilithium per point. That gives you 1,302,000 Dilithium.

**Step 3**

* Buy Uncommon Unreplicatable Materials from the vendor at Memory Alpha (they can be bought in stacks of 100.) They cost 1,000 Dilithium Each, and these mats are used for all of the end game crafting recipies. They can only be acquired by trading in dilithium, or buying off the exchange, so yes, they are rare.

* Do the Math, You had 1,302,000 Dilithium. Divide that By 1000 (cost of each unreplicatable material). Your able to buy 1302 Uncommon Unreplictable Materials. 

**Step 4**

* Sell Uncommon Materials on exchange. You need to get at least 65K Each. These Mats sell for 70K most of the time, but your wanting to sell them fast, so post them up for 65K or 64,999K. Other players who play the economy will buy them up almost instantly
* Selling them in singles is how i sold most of mine. They sold really fast. I would list 35 singles, and 5 stacks of 10.
* Use a alternate character to list even more, dont worry about getting undercut, Your selling them for 65k, they will sell overnight.

* Do the math, If we sold 1302 Uncommon mats at 65k A piece, we have 84,630,000. Almost enough to buy the D'kora.

**Last Step**
* Sell any Powered alien artifacts you get over the time your selling the mats, and that'll make up for the 3-5 Million DIfference. As of writing, D'kora's are selling for 90 Million. I've seen them go as low as 84 Mill. 

**Final Notes**

* The best time to find a cheap D'kora is 9pm PST.
* This is a guarenteed way to get the ship, yes it takes 3-5 days of meddling with the exchange, but imo it's way better than spending $50 on keys, and having no Guarantee. 

* You could also speed up the process by selling rare and very rare doff's off of alts if you wanted to. I didnt have to do that, but it's always a option. I sold all 1300 Uncommon mats in 4 days, and i spent about 2 hours per day on exchange listing. They were literally selling faster than i could list them on several occasions. 

* Protip: on exchange, when you list something, put in your asking price in the box like you always do, except instead of hitting submit, click your mouse on a blank spot of your screen. This will automatically put comma's in your pricing field, and it will also auto remember your auction price, so you dont have to enter it over and over again.

Hope this helps some of you :)

This is a Klingon mission and has a level cap requirements of 45'

You can play it solo, but I recommend playing in a team to get the most out of the mission.

**Your exemplary service to the Empire has not gone unnoticed. You have been invited by the council to take part in a battle exercise that will take place at the Great Tower. You will ascend the tower making your way to the top. Each floor holds a challenge that becomes more difficult as you make your way up.**


Yes, this is a ground mission. I did my best to make it challenging without being frustrating. If you give it a try please feel free to give me your feedback on how I might make this mission better. 


I would like to thank all of you who donated your character models for the mission. I included as many as i could. Those of you who sent me direct image files, I was able to successfully import your characters. Everyone who sent me imgur links, the foundry didn't let me import those models. If you would like to resend them in a way I can use them let me know and I'll get them in the mission. If you have any questions on properly sending the file please let me know.

**Edit: You can find the mission by searching for A Game of Death or my username TheGow. The mission is still in review status, so if you want to find it you will have to look there.**

I'm resigning as Fleet Admiral of *Reddit Alert* and *House of Snoo* and delegating the decision of who the next FA (if there will be one) to the remaining FAs. Before you spam me with questions I will try to answer some of the more important ones below.

-----

&gt; Why are you leaving?

I don't really play STO anymore, and there is little chance that I will ever come back to play STO fulltime in the foreseeable future (getting a job, starting life, etc.). My last logons to STO consisted mainly of roster checks, chat lurking, and other administrative stuff. I think that a FA who actually plays often and is passionate about the game like I was should take my place.

&gt; What happens to us?

I think that there are many capable hands in the fleet who will step up and take leadership, and lead the fleets and subreddit in the right direction. For those who don't remember, a previous FA and moderator took this whole place into the shit, and it took the help and dedication of many players, myself included, to make r/sto into a subreddit where everyone is welcome. Hopefully [the posting rules](http://code.reddit.com/wiki/help/faqs/sto#PostingRules) will keep it that way. Even if you aren't in either of the Reddit fleets, everyone who creates meaningful discussion is a valuable part of this subreddit; it's what makes small subreddits like r/sto good and draws more subscribers. Never forget that.

&gt; What happens to you?

I'm graduating university as an engineer (fuck yeah engineers) at the end of this year so I'll be busy starting life and all that business. As for games, I'll be playing Torchlight 2 for a while, and then Planetside 2 for a long time. There is a great and active community for PS2 on reddit over at /r/planetside, and it's also frequented by the developers (yay John Smedley). I know that some of you will probably be interested in playing with me. Currently it's in beta so you will need to grab a beta key in order to play (they're being handed out everyday... look around).

I will remain moderator of r/sto for the time being since it's still growing, but my interaction will be limited to checking the spam filter and banning trolls. I might still make a few minor additions to the FAQ but what you see now is probably its final form until someone else feels like ~~slaving~~ working on it.

That's pretty much it. I wish all of you good luck, and I look forward to r/sto having a few thousand subscribers someday. Live long and prosper!",,False,self,t5_2rfq3,1346871251.0,,Delta,True,t3_zb9l4,http://www.reddit.com/r/sto/comments/zb9l4/letter_of_resignation/,moderator

1342457596.0,19,self.sto,wnfyz,Nukara Ground Invasion - Exterior - A Guide,21,2,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/sto/comments/wnfyz/nukara_ground_invasion_exterior_a_guide/,"Hey folks!

After playing on Nukara for a few hours straight last night, I have seen the light. This new Tholian ground invasion map, similar to Defera but available at any time and easier, provides some amazing drops and is great to run with in a crowd! I figured a guide would be great for this new ground invasion to help you guys out. This guide covers the exterior missions, and not the interior ones.

Similar to Defera Ground Invasion, there are a couple of missions grouped as Easy, Medium, Hard and Zone-Wide. Each difficulty level has it's own transport area (Base Camp Alpha [easy], Beta [medium] and Charlie [hard]). Indeed, these are a hell of a lot easier with a full group of people, a requirement for hard, but you can do the medium missions alone.

The main drop for each mission is a Tholian Equipment Pack (basic for easy, advanced for medium, elite for hard). From what I've seen, they're like lockboxes in that you can still get the good gear (the Tholian ground set) even from advanced boxes. The boxes also drop EVAs (with ground buffs) and anti-Tholian weapons (very rare Mk XIIs are amazing!). 

First runs of each mission reward fleet marks (5 for easy, 10 for medium, 20 for hard). Apart from the hard mission, easy and medium don't have a cooldown but don't reward fleet marks for around 20 hours after you complete the first run. You still get the requisition pack reward though.

Let's get started.

-**Easy** - 

- Industrial Espionage - With each Tholian spawn point you'll see a little machine generating a rift. Clear the Tholian or two from the area and shut down the machine. Destroy 15 and you complete the mission.

- Scientific Espionage - This mission is great to run even if you're running the medium missions, so always keep this one on! When you kill a Tholian, no matter the zone, they have a chance of dropping a blue science report. Collect 30 blue science reports to complete the mission. If you go on a mad killing spree, especially in the medium zone, you can complete this very quickly.

-**Medium** - 

- Rescuing Redshirts - In the medium zone, you'll see Tholian Webs holding fellow Starfleet/KDF members on the rockbed around the zone. Shoot the web, which will release the crewman. Talk to them, and you get credit for the rescue (this works faster in a team). This mission is very easy to finish in a few minutes if you focus SOLELY on the crewmen and ignore the Tholians, especially if you're in a team. I personally solo'd this mission in 3-5 minutes, so it's great to farm for advanced boxes. Save 15 redshirts and you can turn in it.

- Closing Doors - Before you can start this, you need to acquire yellow ""shut down codes"" from Tholians. After you do, you need to shut down 3 rift emitters opening the larger rifts in this zone. Again, this is a lot easier if you're on a team. Sometimes you'll get a messaging saying that the ""code is invalid"", so just keep trying until it works. After you shut down the rift, either a Tholian Lieutenant will spawn or a fellow crewman (their rescue will count for Rescuing Redshirts and they may give you more Tholian codes). Shut down 15 rifts to turn it in.

-**Hard**

-Transdimensional Tactics - 

This one is a doozy and requires 5 people. You'll need to enter a cave near the transport point of Base Camp Charlie. Once in there, you'll need to tread carefully to the platform at the back of the cave. The liquid on the floor kills, so avoid it as much as possible!

For this mission, I recommend carrying a sniper rifle along with a close range weapon (such as a minigun). Sniper rifles will be required for rifts while the close range weapon can deal with the boss. I also recommend staying on the platform and utilizing bunker emplacements/cover shields as much as possible.

When you activate the console on the platform, the Tholian Project Leader spawns. This part is easy especially if you can keep it back. Keep firing at it until it gets to around 2/3 health, where it'll fall back into a rift. Smaller rifts will then appear (over the deadly liquid, which will also start covering more of the ground, so be careful!). Stay on the platform and use snipers to take down the lieutenants and rifts. If required, tread carefully off the platform to get the rifts farther away.

After the rifts are destroyed, the Project Leader will respawn. Same as before, keep firing at it until it falls back into its rift again. The liquid on the floor will rise again (covering most of the floor now, the platform is your friend now) and Tholian Trappers will spawn from the rifts. Have engineers utilize cover shields and/or wedge yourself between the Tholian consoles on the platform. These trappers will grab you with webs and try to pull you into the liquid. Kill the trappers to prevent getting pulled in.

After these trappers and rifts are destroyed, the Project Leader will respawn one last time giving you a chance to kill it. The difficulty increases with more rifts opening with trappers, so you're stuck dealing with the leader AND trying to avoid getting pulled into the deadly liquid-filled floor. 

Once the leader is killed and the rest of the trappers dealt with, the mission is complete!

I hope this helps you all!

1374879125.0,19,self.sto,1j4m7j,PSA: Elite Romulan Drones (and possibly lesser versions) are terribly broken since the patch.,20,1,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/sto/comments/1j4m7j/psa_elite_romulan_drones_and_possibly_lesser/,"[**The recent patch notes**](http://sto-forum.perfectworld.com/showthread.php?p=11568951) introduced the new pet UI and changes, which should have been a change for the better. However, I think Cryptic might have pushed this to live way too early, as it's ridden with bugs. From the patch notes:

---

*All qualities of the following pets are still replacing active pets if launched while all hangar wings are full:*

- *Tholian Mesh Weavers*
- *Jem'Hadar Attack Ships*
- *Fer'jai Frigates*
- *Bird of Prey Raiders*
- *Marauding Force*
- *Stalker Fighters*

---

The Elite Romulan Drones can be added to this list. Every time you hit your launch button, it will cycle in a new Drone, regardless of there being active drones out or not, meaning that in order to get the experience thing, you either have to manually keep an eye on things and launch only when you lose one, or accept the fact that your pets will never get more than rank 1 experience.

---

There is a second, more serious bug though:

[**The Elite Drones no longer use FAW3 or BO3 at all**](http://sto-forum.perfectworld.com/showthread.php?t=805821), as per the thread in the link. 

I have been able to verify this with [**this recent ISE parse**](http://i.imgur.com/HIOJ59c.jpg). Normally, the FAW3 of the elite drones get rolled into my own FAW3, so at a glance, it's not easy to see. I know that I get around 13-14k dps from the combined FAW's though, so it's a significant reduction.

I've been a gamer for a long time, but not really in the MMO category. Really, I've never known what to expect from one but with the Elder Scrolls MMO coming up I wanted to familiarize myself with the genre a bit and found STO (attracted to it as I'm a Trek fan and it's one of the few F2P games I found which people seem to like and is not likely to go dark overnight).

I've really enjoyed myself in the game so far, but I know I'm missing the point of the MMO thing always going solo. I started a Fed character on the Science track and I've played the missions until last night when I hit level 50. The only team stuff I've done so far is a few Starbase 24 runs where I seem to somewhat consistently come in 2nd or 3rd and a couple Borg RAs.

I'm still trying to figure out a lot of the game mechanics, but what I'm looking for now is what makes STO an MMO game. Even though I've just hit the level cap on this character, I feel like I've barely scratched the surface of the game. So what's next for a player like me?

Also, some questions:

 1. I'm surprised I leveled as fast as I did without deliberately grinding. That's not common for most of the games I play; is it common in the MMO genre?
 2. Is it possible to get the most out of the game without spending real cash? On a related note, I have over 100 Tal Shiar lockboxes I have no intention of buying keys to open if anyone wants them...
 3. Does anybody else find it strange that even though you're the Captain, your boffs seem to call the shots? Sometimes the ""just smile and agree"" rails drive me nuts. :-)

I just quit playing Eve Online (loved the game and the time spent to it) but had to quit as it got too time consuming. Star Trek Online was a real refreshening experience, especially with the possibilities to customize your crew. But onwards to the questions:

1: Are EC important in the game? It looks like its only use is buying standard (white) Stuff or using it for market transactions. All important looking stuff seems to be payed with either fleet credits, dilithium or Zen.

2: Bridge Officers, it looks like there are different kind of rarities for bridge officers, do they have any special features or has it just something to do with the skills they have? I would like to stay with my original crew and noticed you can use other Bridge Officers to train them. Does this training refer to one ability? Is the training bridge officer removed after he trained my current bridge officer?

3: Duty Officers: is there a list anywhere with what duty officers I should have and what abilities are most important?

4: as I kind of understand, the ship bridge is a kind of ""player home"", is there any way to customize your ship interior beside the bridge? Like the Ready Room or the Captains Quarter?

5: are there any missions, foundry or not, you would advise to do (best if doable at my current level) with mainly the fun to play it in mind?

I find this frustrating.  The reason I purchased multiple Romulan Bridge Officers was because this trait stacked, and now any purchased past the first one are no more useful to me than a much cheaper Bridge Officer.  These Bridge Officers are not inexpensive; 80 000 fleet credits and 20 000 dilithium takes a fair bit of time and effort to acquire (especially considering the time-based cap on dilithium).  I do not appreciate that these expenses have now gone to waste.

It isn’t fair to claim, either, that it is okay to do this to players since it’s “only in-game currency”.  The dilithium exchange means that many players purchase their dilithium with zen, which is in turn purchased with actual money.  Fleet credits are often earned with dilithium for many players, which means that they too are connected to real money.  I do not appreciate the squandering of these resources.

Under the January 17th 2013 patch notes, it is claimed that Covert Operative should now “work as intended”.  I interpreted this as meaning that the stacking ability was intended, and was unlikely to be changed.  Despite this being changed to a non-stacking ability as of January 24th 2013, this change was not included in the patch notes.  I do not appreciate misinformation.

I understand that the development team must work to balance the game.  However, it is unfair to take something away that players have spent a significant amount of resources, and possibly real money, to acquire.  Changes of this nature have happened before, and it's time that they stopped occurring.  If this trait is not to be changed back, I think I speak for those affected by this change that we would appreciate a refund of the cost of these extra Romulan bridge officers, or at least some form of recompense.

I know that the game developers sometimes browse this page, which is why I am posting this here.  Also, if you guys help to draw attention to this, hopefully at the very least they will not do things like this again. 

Edit: Sri posted [this link](http://sto-forum.perfectworld.com/showthread.php?p=7646371#post7646371), it looks like the devs have taken some action on this.  Not sure how it will quite turn out in the end but it looks like they're at least going to do something. :)",,False,self,t5_2rfq3,1359158004.0,,Combo,True,t3_177oii,http://www.reddit.com/r/sto/comments/177oii/romulan_boffs_or_why_richard_is_frustrated/,

As you may or may not have noticed, we have replaced the Samples Overflow tab in the fleet bank with a random ""Shoppe"" tab that's been locked out to all except officers. We've had it up for some time, so it's now time for business to commence.

The Reddit Shoppe is the place to go if you want or need something valuable. This bank tab will be devoted purely to highly sought out, expensive and rare items. 

So how do you use it?

1) Donate! If you have something that you think belongs in the shoppe, contact an officer (Captain+) via mail and include your item. They will promptly place said item into the mail. 

2) Buy! If you find something in the Shoppe that you want, contact an officer for a quote. Quoted prices will be lowest available exchange price (within reason - IE - if there's an item for 1000 but the rest are around 10000, it's an outlier and you may as well buy the 1000 one on the exchange anyway!) plus a discount of 50%.

All funds will go toward Starbase development (mainly doffs),  the fleet bank and any future fleet projects/installations that Cryptic decides to throw at us.

This is essentially what they are doing with the Snoo bank. As this is a first for our fleet, changes may occur depending on use of the Shoppe. 

Enjoy!

Here we go again, yet another week for State of the Fleet! Not a lot of huge things this week, but alas, there's always news!

Note-Worthy Game Events -

- [Starbase Special Project 7 is out.](http://sto.perfectworld.com/news/?p=703051) Includes a conference room for the Federation (which has a noticeable bloom and clipping issue, I told Zero about it last night, but I'm not sure if she saw the mention) and the huge fireplace has been lit for the KDF.
- [Screenshots of the future Vesta Class have been revealed.](https://twitter.com/LCDRMiller/status/253901148854034432/photo/1/large)
- From Friday October 19th to Sunday October 21st,  PWE will be present at Destination Star Trek London. Guests will be able to receive a code for a Holo-Leeta doff and the Convention Veteran title.

Fleet Events -

- Tuesday's Reddit turnout at Boss/DJ Creamy's party at Club 47 was amazing! Thank you all for coming out, we all had lots of fun, and thank you Boss for the invitation and great welcome!
- Both RA and Snoo completed Special Project 7 very quickly. Enjoy your new starbase additions!
- Thank you Lucien for your VERY successful giveaway last Saturday. That is one of the largest Reddit gatherings I think we've ever had!
- Congratulations to Rowsdower to his promotion to Admiral! 
- RA's tier IV projects should start up in about 20-25 days.
- Both Snoo and RA have been confirmed to be one of, if not, the most advanced starbases in the entire game by the devs!
- Going to host a Terradome run tomorrow for kicks. Whether we can successfully do it, we'll see. Likely around 7 PM EDT.

Other Stuffs -

- In other news, Quinn has been suffering major emotional issues lately. If you can't find him in his office, he's likely at Club 47 begging for money or dancing in Club 47. In all seriousness, a bug has been discovered where KDF can enter ESD and have been moving various personnel around. You'll likely be seeing security personnel with weapons out and misplaced personnel. Either search around or switch to another instance.
- This week's Spotlight on the Foundry is [Keeping up with the J'Sens](http://sto.perfectworld.com/news/?p=705501), where you must assist the Deferi with resettling this unaligned race.
- Boss/DJ Creamy is giving out Holo-Leeta codes for a Temporal Ship, 80-100m ec or equivalent.


Money/Business Matters -

- Today's Dilithium/Zen price is 156 Dilithium for 1 Zen, down from 161 a few days ago due to the special project coming out. That's 51 zen for 8000 dilithium.
- Key prices are stagnant around 1.4-1.5 million ec.
- Cheap mini-doff packs are appearing a lot more often now due to the overinflation of the packs available. At 4 doffs per pack, you could make extra money on the doffs themselves. Confirmed yesterday that you can get rare doffs from these cadres.

Tip of the Week -

- Efficient Saurian/Lethean officers, you hear about them a lot in chat but do you actually know what they are? 

Unlike other boffs, some Saurian/Lethean officers, especially rares and very rares (sometimes uncommon), come with an extra space trait called ""efficient"".

They sell for a lot of money on the exchange, but what do they actually do?

Efficiency basically improves your power management when power levels are set low on various systems. For instance, if you max power on weapons but keep power low on auxiliary and engines, you'll notice a power boost with auxiliary and engines.

This is extremely useful, allowing for better power performance while not requiring you to sacrifice power flow from another system. If you find a cheap one or get one from a boff-from-doff mission, you got money in your pocket!

See you online! If you have anything you want added to next week's State of the Fleet, leave me a line in the STO mail or PM on Reddit.

After you complete each of the 14 Colonization chains, you get the repeatable *Support Colonization Efforts* mission for each one. If you Crit it, you get one of 14 Very Rare Duty officers.

Cryptic, in an effort to make getting Rare/Uncommon/Common DOFFs for Starbase projects easier, introduced the DOFF Grinder at Starfleet Academy, which lets you turn an Uncommon/Rare/Very Rare duty officer into three of the next lowest category of duty officer. So, a Very Rare becomes three Rares.

Along with that, there's the Children's Toys chain, which lets you craft Uncommon/Rare/Very Rare Mk XII consoles. The final step of Children's Toys, *Fabricate Prototype Console from Alien Artifact*, needs five Engineers with Resolve for Success, with Crits on Efficient, Stubborn, and Cunning.

There is a Tellarite Personnel Officer at Starfleet Academy, and all Tellarites come with Stubborn as a default trait, with the possibility of being generated with Resolve, an Engineering specialization, or both.

Tellarites with Stubborn and Resolve fetch around a million EC on the Exchange. Tellarite Engineers with Stubborn and Resolve fetch 20 million plus. Very Rare Mk XII Consoles net between 3 and 50 million EC, depending on the console.

So, what we have here is an unlimited supply of redundant Very Rare duty officers that can be obtained relatively quickly and in large quantity, while also awarding Refugees that can be exchanged via Asylum missions for more DOFFs of varying quality.

The only caveat is because the Grind to Craft ratio is 3:5, you need 5 *Support* DOFFs to make three Tellarite DOFFs. But, you can regrind any useless Tellarites into 3 more Rares. You'll almost inevitably end up with a few spare Rare DOFFs, but those can always hang around until you have other Rares to combine them with.

Do you see where I'm going with this?

TL;DR - it's possible to ""farm"" the Support Very Rare DOFFs, break them down into Rare DOFFs, feed them to the Tellarite Personnel Officer, and get a Very Rare DOFF that's worth between one and twenty million plus EC with the right traits on the Exchange, or assemble a team of those DOFFs to craft Mk XII consoles and either keep them, sell them, or give them away.",,False,self,t5_2rfq3,False,,Delta,True,t3_zlh07,http://www.reddit.com/r/sto/comments/zlh07/doff_grinding_for_fun_and_profit/,

Although we just found out last Friday, on June 24th, one of our former DJs and good friends, Mike ""Buzz"" Woods passed away from a heart attack.  We were informed by his girlfriend and it was a bit of a shock as he a was a pretty young guy.  Buzz was a great guy and always very supportive both on-air and behind the scenes.  We're all going to miss him terribly.

With that said, we're going to be doing a couple of things for him tomorrow, Wednesday July 11th.  One of our DJs, Erroch will be going on air at 3PM EDT (1900 GMT), then at 5PM EDT (2100 GMT) we'll be playing his first show.  Following that, our station manager, DJ Jahner will be hosting a special memorial show for Buzz at 8PM EDT (Midnight GMT).  There will be an open forum in Teamspeak (voice.gamingradio.net) with an on-air relay so staff and listeners can swap stories and honor his memory.

So, this is an open invite for all you guys.  Feel free to tune in and join our in-game chat channel ""SSR""

I decided to take some action seeing as how no one really did anything. I browsed the fleet roster and removed anyone who has been inactive for 45 days or more to make room for players who are active.

If you got booted and are reading this, please know that it is nothing personal; by being inactive for over 45 days, I thought it reasonable to assume that you either quit STO or went on vacation. Should you wish to return to Reddit Alert, you will be invited again, no questions asked.

A total of 64 people were removed from the roster, placing us at 436 members total out of a maximum capacity of 500. From now on, I think it's also pretty reasonable to extend the deadline for inactivity to 60 days, seeing as how Reddit Alert has passed its exponential growth phase (I hope). However, we can still expect to gain new members since STO itself is still actively being developed.

**Summary:**

* Members of Reddit Alert who have been inactive for 45 days from today (25 March 2012) have been removed from the roster to make room for active players. 64 people were removed due to inactivity, placing us at 436 members out of a maximum of 500.

* If you have been removed from the fleet and wish to return, you are welcome to return at any time.

I want everyone's input on this. I know I took initiative without informing the other officers, but the problem was discussed without any action taking place, and there were people who were unable to join Reddit Alert due to a full roster. I think this was the best possible course of action with the least negative consequences; but, again, any input is appreciated.

-----------------------------
NEW INFO (UNCONFIRMED)

The ""Territory Control"" is a **GROUND COMBAT** mechanic.

The Dyson Sphere Zone is the size of a **3x3 SECTOR SPACE GRID** and there are **THREE DYSON SPHERES.**

Rep system is changing for the voth one. No normal rep system you get loot when doing stuff and can be mkxii stuff.

The new zone is not one zone, but at least two, probably more. Basically you will have the space adventure zone flying inside the dyson sphere over the living space down below. There was a really sweat screenshot showing these awesome towers jutting up from the inner surface of the sphere out through the atmosphere layer. The concept art is from the space adventure zone.

There will also be battle zones in which PCs will enter in groups of 20 plus boffs (I missed this part but it was pretty clear boffs will be limited). The battlezones will be territory control where the players battle the Voth for control of the sphere, area by area. It felt like the various zones would be persistent, once you take a zone you have to hold it, if everyone leaves the Voth will eventually take it back.

It sounded like there will be multiple zones on the surface of the dyson sphere, though they said they are still building.

The sphere somehow ties into the Iconian storyline, the bridger missions coming in September will be a direct followup to the Romulan rep missions, won't say more because I don't want to spoil it, but if you haven't finish it.

Night shift on the bridge of the U.S.S. Koonut-Kaliffee. The engine's humming lulls the crew to a gentle snooze. A red light starts to flicker and its accompanying beep startles Lt. Cmdr. Swenid, the huge Nausicaan with a heart of cotton. With a grotesque sound somewhere between a snore and a grunt he sits up.""Captain to the bridge!"" The door to the ready room opens and Captain Pib stumbles onto the bridge, hastily zipping up his fly. ""What disturbs my meditation?"" he asks. ""Captain, we are picking up unusual readings from the Hfihar System. The Federation database matches them to Species M-113."" says Swenid. ""Salt Vampires! Beam me down at once!"", demands the Captain. ""Captain, we are still 7.4 lightyears away and Starfleet Regulations clearly..."" ""To hell with the regulations! Maximum Warp!""*  
  
  ~~~  
    
**0. Introduction - Check out the corpse on the street, that the locals just don't seem to notice.**  
  The map is divided into 4 districts: Mining, Market, Industrial and Residential. Each team beams down into one district. The first objective, to get the mision started, is to investigate the body (marked on the minimap). Just approach it and a regular interaction option appears. A message appears and the timer for Act 1 starts.  
    
**1. Curfew**  
Each district has 32 Romulan Civilians who are in need of saving. The team now has to approach every civilian to tell them to go home. Remember, you are assigned a district - focus on it. The mission tracker (usually on the right side of your screen) keeps track on how many civilians are back in their home. After your district is complete (your district turns green on the mission tracker), feel free to help out other districts as long as you have the time, but don't run away too far from your assigned district, ever!  
The catch is that some of the civilians are actually representatives of Species M-113 -  they show their true hideous face after telling them to go home. Shoot them all. In fact shoot whenever you see one immediately, i.e. help the other players, as the Salt Vampires in this phase hold the players who are then unable to move. Sniper Rifles are useful here.  
Salt Vampires also have the ability to confuse you. A confusion which either designates you a target to your allies, or worse, designates your allies (players and civilians) as targets. If that happens, STOP SHOOTING and be extra careful with powerful abilities like Orbital Strike.  
However, the confusion effect lasts only for a few seconds.  
  
  **2. Fortify the buildings**  
  Each district has 4 buildings, in which the civilians hide. These buildings need to be fortified. Pick up materials from containers - containers are marked with small circles on the minimap, the buildings are the larger circles. Then, run to a building and fortify it (regular interaction option). Notice the health bar for every building. Protip: you can have fortification materials in your inventory even after this phase, which means you can basically repair a building in the next phase. Usually though this is not the case - it is more important to fortify the buildings to full health in this phase.  
  Market building 4 is bugged, its health bar won't increase after fortification, so if your team finds itself responsible for the Market district, don't bother with building 4. Take extra care of it in the next phase though.  
    
**3. Protect the buildings**  
Each team member announces which building they are going to protect. The fifth team member floats. Focus on the 'Subterranean Entrances' from which the Salt Vampires come crawling. If an Alpha spawns (a captain level Salt Vampire), call it out in team chat and focus on it. An Alpha is hard to kill for one player. Lunge is great against them. In fact, don't forget to use your Kit and class abilities during the whole mission! Drones, turrets, redshirts, tricorder scans - all very useful. But don't use damage dealing abilities that can kill civilians. If you do this I will personally visit and slap you.  
  
  **4. Escort the civilians**  
  After the buildings have been successfully protected (or not) the civilians must be escorted to a shuttle rendezvous point. Each district has its own rendezvous point and path to it. When in doubt where to go, just follow the civilians and your team mates. Along the way Salt Vampires attack. Kill them as per usual. Some of the civilians get tired, you need to talk to them to get them going again. One important thing to know is that if a civilian happens to die, you can actually resuscitate them.  
    
**5. Protect the civilians**  
Once everyone has reached the shuttle rendezvous point, the civilians will stand around and wait for their rescue. Your job is to protect them, because surprisingly a bunch of Salt Vampires will spawn and attack. Again - focus on Subterranean Entrances and Alphas. Call out Alphas in team chat. Deploy med generators for the civilians. When your district's civilians are saved (mission tracker text turns green) feel free to run to other rendezvous points to help out.  
After everything is said and done, you have to wait a little while to receive the Mark Box, so don't beam out immediatly. Also congratulate your team mates for being awesome.  
  
  
**Hear this:**  
  - Read team chat  
  - Stay inside your district  
  - Focus on Subterranean Entrances and Alphas (call them out)  
  - Don't kill the civilians  
  - Resuscitate civilians who died  
  - Make use of your abilities, like Seeker Drone, Turret, Orbital Strike, Security Team, Lunge, etc.  
  - Stop shooting if the Salt Vampires confuse you!  
  - Help your team mates  
  - Be a good sport  
  
 I probably forgot a whole bunch of things, so feel free to comment and ask away if something is unclear.  
Good Luck!

I have been closed beta testing for a few weeks, got my first character to 22 before the wipe, new character is 42 currently.  with the exception of story (because I purposefully didn't read) , and the last 2 missions (cuz they are broken) I will try to provide any insight I can.  The current tips I can provide off the top of my head are: 

Skip the lv 30 d'deridex warbird because the turn rate is 5, keep the mogai it will be fine, you will survive if you have half decent gear.

Keep in mind what mission gives a weapon you like, they have new hybrid weapons out there, and they can be fun. (this is probably more important for tribble grinding as no one sells weapons on tribble auction.)

Certain missions will reward you with warp cores, green quality but they increase your warp speed and will probably be slim pickings for a bit on exchange, I think 2-3 missions give them along the way but its best to just redo one of them as soon as you rank up. (chugging away in sector space at warp 5 gets really boring real fast.)


The following tip is only available on tribble, will not be in the holodeck:
 
When you hit 40, go to DS9 and the old omega vendor will be selling the new nukara stuff, load up with a full ground and space set MK X for free.  Once you hit 50, a full compliment of of MK12 tetryon weapons and MK12 space/ground set.  also free consumable items like the web breaker which will blow up the tholian webs.

What you want to do is first, log in with your account (PW account, this is a official STO site) and select one of your characters. Now look at the url, it should look something like this


    http://gateway.startrekonline.com/#char(Name@Handle)/

Example: http://gateway.startrekonline.com/#char(Kraust@sdkraust)/

You can modify the Name and @Handle variables to look at any other Captains in this game. For example, while logged in you can do something like

    http://gateway.startrekonline.com/#char(Enzo Aquarius@enzoaquarius)/

And you will reach Enzo's character page for his Character ""Enzo Aquarius""

Why is this important you might ask? Well maybe you are having issues helping someone in RedditChat with their ship build. With this you can easily look up their ship, and try and give them some sound advice. You may also want to sneak a peek at someone build you have been baggering them about for the past few days (and they've been ignoring you...).

What is your favourite ship in the game? And if there's a ship you really want to get, what is it and why do you want it so?

Mine is the Heavy Escort Carrier. After buying it a couple months ago, I have just fallen in love with the thing. It's got great speed, it handles nicely, it can load dual cannons (which I am a huge fan of), and has a great array of Tac-heavy stuff that tunes very nicely to me. It's also a beast of a ship that feels very tanky at times (for being an escort of course). Also the fighters come in very handy for a bit of extra DPS, or to ward off little crap you can never see. And torpedos (I'm loving the torpedo point defence and the photon torpedo launcher (with high-yield) combo. It's like throwing buckets of water at enemies, except it's torpedos rather than water)

If I was to have any other ship in the game, it would be the Fleet Heavy Escort Carrier. It's like the regular one, except a lot more tanky and badass.

At least, it happens in Khitomer Vortex and The Conduit. Strangely enough, I've failed Cure Found outright many times and have yet to see a single person so much as express mild displeasure at the event. But I digress.

The reward for an elite STF is 1760 dilithium worth of stuff at minimum, often more. And yet some captains get so mad when they lose those 15 bonus marks, which is worth about 150 dilithium, or at most an 8% bonus on top of what they already would have earned.

Which brings me to my story.

I was in The Conduit the other night, and we hit a snag. Someone blew a generator too soon and we were unable to destroy the transformer before a sphere managed to repair it. One of our teammates then started to complain. As always, I pointed out that all we lost was a few omega marks and that he should chill.

""It's not about the marks, it's the principle of the matter!"" the disgruntled captain said.

They always say that. It's basically a sophisticated way of saying ""GTFO noobs"" without sounding like a douche bag. Well, less like one. We went back and forth for a bit. Him complaining about kids these days not bothering to learn the mission and me saying that it's not that big a deal.

He then went on to say that the player who blew the generator too early was now wasting his time by making him destroy more ships in order to finish the mission. There are all kinds of issues I had with that, the most significant being his assertion that the mission would now take three times as long to complete. I pointed out that it would only take a few extra minutes at most to finish the mission. 

Apparently this was the last straw for our teammate. He said that he had had enough of us ""fools"" and abandoned the mission.

As a result of his ragequit over us wasting his time, this player lost out on over 1700 dilithium as well as 20 minutes of his time. He also lost another hour of his time due to invoking the leaver ban penalty when he was the first to abort the mission.

I, on the other hand, received 11 neural processors when we completed the mission without him.

* Q is in Club 47 on ESD, and in front of the Council House in First City.

* Tip: Party Poppers seem to be the one you'd want to be mainly farming. From below: 

&gt; Look up the prices of old poppers on the exchange. 2nd Anniversary popper goes for around 1.6 Mil and the 1st Anniversary popper goes for 8 Mil. The event is only 2 weeks and getting them is harder this year the in the past. Skip the lame prizes and 500 Dil and farm poppers.

I came to this conclusion because Star trek doesn't feel like a cohesive game yet. Star Trek has many fun but separate elements however,like an amusement park we are led around via rewards from one ride to the next building up tickets to buy things at the prize shop. The rides are fun however we have been on them many times before. (mirror events, STFs,pvp,Fleet missions,starfleet academy,)

I do see a cohesive game developing with the incorporation of Commendation Xp into more aspects of the game.  Cxp now converts to Fleet Marks which incorporates the fleet starbase. Well done on that plan.

I must say , I am a huge fan of the ""explore unknown systems"" combined with the colonization duty assignments, Between the two of them I start to get some good Star Trek immersion :) The reward of favorable duty assignments and duty officers from the region is a nice touch. 

I love the fact that the exploration missions are random however my criticism is that they are not in context, repetitive, static, linear, with no permanence, development or story progression. 

Using Cxp to roll play a colony ship ,medical ship, scientist or diplomat is starting to become a part of the long term reward system in the game and is a big step to opening up game play. I am looking forward to other game systems that support this dynamic roll playing initiative.

Foundry is of course a great outlet , and any idealist like myself should get his ass into foundry and make the game that I am talking about :) instead of talking about it.

The person I talked to who I think is having the most fun playing this game is a guy who plays real life star trek RPG with friends, and uses the game to create various scenes and scenarios to augment his roll playing story. In my opinion this player has the right idea until the game mechanics start to fill in with more dynamic\relevant content.

hmmm, guess I'll look at the queue list and decide what to play.

however if this is an amusement park, we must remember its theme,  

-Space the Final frontier ,  These are the Voyages of a starship, its continuing mission to explore strange new worlds and seek out new life and new civilizations ,  to boldly go where no one has gone before.

Feds

* Peregrines: good for raw dps vs unshielded targets. (PVE)
* Danubes: good for slowing down moving targets, which lowers their def rating, which means more hits/crits for you. (PVP)
* Deltas: good vs shielded targets and shield neutralization. (Tank/bunker busters)
* Stalkers: antiproton sweep is good for cloaked targets.
* Shield repair units: can be used on you or ally, especially useful in the new missions where you have to keep something alive.

Let's have a discussion about how to farm dilithium quickly and efficiently. Here are a couple of my personal tips and tricks that I use:

* Since I don't play every day, it's possible for me to ""save"" daily missions. The 20 hour cooldown timer for daily missions begins when you accept the mission, not when you complete it, so it's possible to accept a daily, wait 20 h, then complete the same daily twice in a row for double the rewards.

* Join the REDALERT channel for real-time Borg alerts. If you are Level 50 and have decent equipment, a Borg alert takes about 10 ~ 15 minutes to complete and rewards **480 D**.

* The ""Investigate Officer Reports"" daily rewards **1440 D** each time it is completed. Quick foundry missions are made by The_Grand_Nagus. For Federation, they are called ""Distress Call"" and ""Prisoner Transfer"", and for KDF they are called ""Shipyard Defense"". This daily takes less than ~10~ 30 minutes to complete if you use these special foundry missions.

* Combine ""Explore Strange New Worlds"" with an exploration mission. If you are Level 50, combine this with ~""Chart the B'Tran Cluster""~ to earn an easy **2880 D**. This should take about half an hour to complete.

* The security officer on ESD/Qo'nos/DS9 lets you turn in ~~3x~~ 5x Contraband for an easy **2000 D**. If you have Contraband or spare energy credits to purchase them on the exchange, you can do this every ~~two~~ four hours.

* Elite STFs reward **960 D** each time and take about half an hour each to complete. You also get Borg Neural Processors, which can be traded at a rate of 5 BNPs = 1000 D through the reputation system (but it is highly recommended that you save your BNPs to purchase Mk XII gear at Tier 5 Omega rep).

* Starfleet Academy and KDF Academy have a midterm daily which you can use to quickly grab **480 D**. This takes less than a minute and you can guarantee your success by using [this page](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AhYCXe6RfDINdFk0WTBXYzNxU2ZzNGV5UEw2aGdQbmc#gid=61) (Interactive Path to 2409).

That's a pretty routine run for me when I'm trying to hoard dilithium. What are your strategies?

Edit: forgot one!

Edit 2: as of Season 6, Turn Over Contraband now requires 5 instead of 3 contraband, and has a four hour CD instead of a two hour one.

Edit 3: as of Season 7, Elite STFs now reward much less than before since Borg tech/salvage and EDCs no longer exist, and ""Chart the B'Tran Cluster"" no longer exists.",,False,self,t5_2rfq3,1353418332.0,,Delta,True,t3_uq8va,http://www.reddit.com/r/sto/comments/uq8va/share_your_dilithium_farming_methods/,

&gt;Although the Risian Lohlunat Summer Festival will continue to be available well into August, Lohlunat Pearls will only be offered as a reward from “Flying High!” for a total of 35 days, starting June 27th and running until August 2nd. During this time, players will need to participate 25 times in order to earn their FREE Starship.

In other words, as of the time of this post, ~~you can run Flying High approximately 10 more times before it will no longer reward pearls.~~ **see edit below**

If you were working toward the Risian Corvette but haven't managed to get at least ~~600~~ 480 pearls, or if you miss it once and/or don't run Flying High exactly every 20 hours (you can't wait 24hrs), you won't acquire enough to claim the Corvette without buying pearls with Lobi crystals.

However, as far as everyone's been told, the project will sit in queue until next summer with the pearls you've already acquired and you'll (in theory) be able to finish it next year.

**(edit) - I'm being told this was extended to Sunday, 8/4.**  That means you'll be able run it approximately 13 more times and would have to have at least 480 pearls so far.

Still, you don't have until 8/15 when the Summer Event ends.  (editedit - see /u/egtownsend's link)",,False,self,t5_2rfq3,1374709131.0,,Combo,True,t3_1iyrnc,http://www.reddit.com/r/sto/comments/1iyrnc/risian_corvette_psa_pearls_will_only_be_rewarded/,

A Dot / Ship Silhouette for every ship that you launch. It turns 3 colors. Green: It's good! Yellow: Shields are gone and hull damage, Red: Critical, almost Dead. That's it. It's not a complicated readout, it's just a visual indicator of 'How many ships' you have out, and what their status is like.

Example: I launch a wing of Scorpion Fighters. 3 Silhouettes pop up in the display area. they go into battle. two go yellow, one stays green. I launch another wing. another 3 silhouettes pop up. Two Fighters go pop, 2 Silhouettes go away. I launch another wing. 1 dissipates, 3 new green ones pop up on the display.

To hopefully cut down on that a bit, here's a quick guide to crafting warp cores for sweet, sweet EC with the DOff system. If someone is confused and you don't feel like holding their hand through crafting a warp core, point them here.

**How to find the assignment**

The assignment you want is called Experimental Warp Core Upgrades (or if you're a Romulan, you can also get Experimental Singularity Core Upgrades).

It's an engineering assignment that can be found (rarely) in sector space, but you're much more likely to find it from your engineering department head (click the Department Heads tab at the top of your DOff window, then click the assignments button next to engineering).

*Some info about how department head assignments work:*

* Each sector block (Sirius, Beta Ursae, etc, NOT the sectors inside a sector block such as Bajor/Cardassia/Kalandra inside BU) will have its own set of department head assignments.  
* Department head assignments are unique to you. Other people are NOT guaranteed to see the same department head assignments in the same sector.  
* Department head assignments CAN be shared by inviting people to your bridge and having them talk to the DOff contacts on your ship.  
* Department head assignments reset every 20h, unlike sector assignments which reset every 4h. There isn't anything in the game's UI that communicates when this reset is.

If someone says they got the assignment somewhere, make sure they mean they got it in sector space and not from their department head. If it's from their department head, unless they invite you to their bridge the info about where they got the assignment is completely useless.

**TL;DR**: fly to every sector checking your engineering department head until you find it. If someone says ""I found it here,"" they're probably wasting your time.

**How to do the assignment**

The warp core version of the assignment require 2x Matter-Antimatter Specialists and 2x Science. Matter-Antimatter Specialist is the success trait for all 4 slots (which is likely a bug since M-A Specialists are in Engineering, not Science) and Efficient, Logical, and Teamwork are the critical success traits.

The Romulan-only singularity version requires 2x Gravimetric Scientists and 2x Science. Gravimetric Scientist is the success trait for all 4 slots and Cunning, Teamwork, and Efficient are the critical success traits.

The assignment takes 8 hours and has a 24 hour cooldown from when the assignment completes, so you can start it once every 32 hours.

How to get the DOffs you need? Check Lt. Ferra or his Gorn equivalent KDF-side and see if they have any, otherwise the exchange has plenty of really expensive Matter-Antimatter Specialists.",,False,self,t5_2rfq3,1369533112.0,,Combo,True,t3_1f0fbj,http://www.reddit.com/r/sto/comments/1f0fbj/a_quick_warp_core_doff_crafting_guide/,
