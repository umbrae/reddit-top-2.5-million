We've been struggling with performance on our medum size (80vm's, 6tb data) vsphere 4.1 farm. Emc support is a fn joke on the San side, vmware was a little better but is more about helping fix little things than holistic ""it runs like shit sometimes"" type support.

Our problem has been with ""Citrix is slow"" or ""Servers are slow"" several times a week during peak loads.

I've pulled my hair out learning and fixing every problem in our vmware environment (var and ""professional services"" f'd our install so bad it's criminal"" and our EMC san iscsi back end.

Cpu %ready with vproc scheduling problems, iscsi pathing, lacp trunks with saturated mixed with empty channels, all .vmdks on the same LUN, etc, etc.

I couldn't read books and manuals and best practice shit fast enough. And of course, our It dept consists of 15k users, an IT director, three helpdesk guys that barely can fix printers, and me.  

I basically keep at cot in my office I'm there so much.  Lately it's been so bad with Citrix users pissed off with ""slowness"" (our whole farm is virtualized) I walk into my office expecting the HR guys standing there every day to fire me.  All the professional contractor vmware expert contractor companies' guys knew less than I do when I call trying to get any kind of help.

On a whim I downloaded the vkernel .ovf monitoring tool.

H O L Y      S H I T.

Everything. Every issue, every problem, clearly pointed out. Charted. With ""Would you like to fix this now, or would you like to schedule it fixed tonight?"" options.

Turns out that not only did we have iscsi pathing problems which were bottlenecking access to the san backend, but my boss had been ""helping"" behind my back by fn adjusting resource limits on random servers.  Some had cpu resource limits at 500mhz. Some had affinity randomly set to random cores. Some nics were saturated in lacp channels, while most were empty. It was like letting your toddler nephew flip switches.

I know this sounds like I'm a retard and maybe I am (then again, I'm BSEE, MCSE, CCNP, so can hold my own in a pinch usually) but when you're stressed and busy and the world's crashing down and you have no help, and are too busy keeping things running to ever get formal vmware training, it's damned tough to connect the esxtop dots, and wade through an avalanche of conflicting thousand page ""best practice"" docs.

I had our vmware environment completely fixed in one day. One day. Eight hours. Two years of f'd vmware/san, and this software showed me end to end what's up.

Downvote this if you want, but this stuff is the real deal. I'm sure a lot of guys are already running it, but if you're like me, and I know some of you are, then give it a try. Maybe it'll save your job too.

&gt;Dear Mr. dominoconsultant:
&gt; 
&gt;Thank you for your loyalty to VMware and for taking the time to contact us regarding the Workstation pricing issue you highlight below.  I take all customer complaints very seriously and want you to know that my team is reviewing our overall Workstation pricing strategy.  Our ultimate goal... 
&gt;None-the-less, now for the good news.  Given the significant overall exchange rate situation, I asked my team to review the overall approach and as you may have noticed, we recently reduced Workstation 9 prices in Australia... I hope this provides a bit more context and FX aside, gives you comfort in knowing that VMware is not trying to charge Australian customers more than in other regions.  Again, thank you for contacting us.

I arrived about 1/2 hour early and they let me sit the exam early which was nice as I was really stressing out.

They are very secure about who they let in.  I had to fill out a form that I have read the rules, got my picture taken and was given a dry-erase pad to take with me.  No phone, no wallet.  I was allowed to keep my keys

I answered the survey questions as best as I could and the exam started right after that.  Some questions (very few) were easy, while others I had to read over a couple of times just to figure out what they were really asking for in an answer.  

You can make sure you didn't miss any after you get to question 85 by hitting a review button.  It will tell you if you missed any questions (skipped by accident I assume) or if you only picked 2 answers when you needed to pick 3.  You can also mark specific questions you are unsure about to review later.

After the review process I clicked end and the system asked me twice if I was sure that I wanted to end as there was no going back after.

The pass/fail screen pops up and tells you what the score is and if you passed or failed and that a print out would be given to you when you leave.

I passed!

I am now going to relax the rest of the day and have a beer or two.

The failure took down all of our volumes in that group and we instantly lost 140 TB of production storage/capacity (yes we had backups). Vendor techs worked on the issue for 12 hours before giving up.

Needless to say, it has been a long week. We had production resources back up in 18 hours (that was a long day). All volumes were once again replicated between sites in 72 hours. Internally, everything is still a complete mess of course.

There is a silver lining though... you know the saying ""In disaster is born opportunity""? Well we had been warning folks up the ladder for 6 months about how we had outgrown Equallogic (we had also been complaining to our Equallogic reps about stability). This disaster proved our point and we have half a million in new gear coming in two weeks.

I haven't dug through the subreddit much yet, but I'm almost through all the best practices docs for SQL on ESX(i) from MS and VMWare.

A bit about the environment:

4 SQL servers on mixed Dell hardware. Most recent is an R720.
Attached to Gigabit iscsi SAN over gigabit switches.
Multipath and jumbo frames enabled
LUNS on 8-10 spindles of 10K SAS per volume (shared with out of use SQL server that is being rebuilt. Can still cause a bit of contention when data is being copied)
All DB's are Stage or QA servers, but are still VERY high transaction databases
Needs 40+GB of memory (within SQL) - current servers have 64-128GB and are fine.
IO average of about 2000-3500 IOPs, 150-300MB/s with latency of about 1-2 seconds during horrible times


My question is this. What specifically should I look out for? Pitfalls with configuration of SQL, Hardware, Windows and SQL? Better yet, what did you wish you knew after virtualizing SQL that you didn't know before?

I've only used ESXi (free version) and only very recently installed ESXi 5, so I don't know anything about advanced features like VMotion, and DRS, but want to put these on a paid version of ESX so I can leverage more advanced features and can be more flexible with these servers in specific. Does it make sense to pool with only two servers like this?

Some specific things I'm concerned about:

1) NUMA configuration - After reading about this, it can be really bad to mis-configure this due to remote memory access performance hits. Does Virtual NUMA fix this automatically in ESX 5? 

2) Drive configuration - We use mutipath iscsi to a pair of Dell MD3220i SAN's. How does this translate if I want to use VMFS and what does the host see if I'm not using MS iscsi initiator? Do I have to buy Enterprise version to get this option, or will I have to use DRM with standard version and just pass iSCSI through to host?

3) Large Pages - What is this and why?

4) Hardware optimization - What are my options? I don't know much about this. We are a Dell shop.

I have so many questions bouncing around in my head, so I don't want to inundate this thread, but any input here would be great. I don't want to over design it, but this is a pretty large change, and we've been having trouble with some of our older SQL servers, so I don't want to put anything in place that will perform worse. I also have very little time to implement.

Thanks,

sfcg

EDIT: I've got a newborn, so I'll answer the questions later, but thanks for the comments so far! They are really helpful!

EDIT #2: I just wanted to thank you all for your input. This is an exciting project for me and your input has really helped a lot. I would recommend the training that /u/bobLobIaw recoomended below if you are interested. 4 hours and VERY in depth. I think the next step for me is really just virtualizing one of the nodes and testing an apples to apples comparison to see how it performs, then I can address the issues one by one. THANKS AGAIN!

Re:  Australian VMWare Workstation 9 upgrade pricing


Dear Sirs &amp; Ms. James,


I was pleased to recently receive an invitation to upgrade from VMWare Workstation 8 to release 9.  As this is a tool I use everyday and find quite valuable for my productivity I am keen to proceed with the upgrade.


I did however have two questions relating to the upgrade pricing of the release in Australia that I feel should be directed to the board:


Q1.  Why is the US price for the upgrade US$119 and the Australian price AU$174.50 when the exchange rate is approximately AU$1 = US$1.0376 (as of this writing)?

Q2.  Are you aware that on 24 May 2012 the Australian Federal Government House Standing Committee on Infrastructure and Communications resolved to inquire into IT price discrimination, following a request from the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, Senator Stephen Conroy?  (refer: http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/House_of_Representatives_Committees?url=ic/itpricing/index.htm)

While I am interested in the new features of this release, I will opt to refrain from upgrading until I hear back from a representative of the Board of Directors on this matter.  Preferably via email.


Regards,


Mike Smith

We are having performance issues with an application (the Perforce CVS), and I suspect improper usage of the application itself but I would like to completely rule out any issues with the VM storage. 

We see high disk queuing inside the Windows guest (frequently in the 1.0-2.0 range, but as high as 10). Since the application is heavily DB-based, disk queuing will surely affect performance.  


I'd like to check that small writes (database operations) AND large writes (file downloads/uploads) are performing OK at the storage layer.

By 'semi-proprietary' I mean it was purpose built hardware by a vendor that stopped supporting the item several years ago, so new parts are no longer available.

We pulled the hard drive and attached it to my work laptop (which happens to be OS X but running Windows 7 on Fusion) via USB and connected the dead systems hard drive to the Fusion VM. I did some quick googling and encountered a bunch of conflicting information about virtualizing from hard drive. I first attempted using a hard drive to .vhd conversion program and that particular path did not work for me. I used a free 30 day trial of ghost software (I don't mean to plug another company, just outlining the process) to convert the dead systems hard drive to a .sv2i image.

I then used the VMWare Standalone Converter to convert the .sv2i image to a virtual machine that ran on ESXi. Due to program software dependent on a hardware key, we re-converted the VM to run on Workstation/Player and resurrected the dead system on a laptop.

**TLDR;** P2V'd a dead system hard drive via usb on another system with ghost (google the vendor) to VMWare Standalone Converter. 

The source system hard drive I converted was Windows XP Pro SP2 based.
I used ghost 15 and VMWare vCenter Standalone Converter 5.0.0 build-470252 to perform the P2V.

I plan to use 200GB of the storage as just a regular CIFS share.

I'm ready to inject this Matrix style.,16,2,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/vmware/comments/pxxre/vmware_knowledge_060mph_in_35_seconds_im_ready_to/,"Brief backstory: So, this morning (20 Feb) I interviewed for a mid-tier IT Tech position at a large hospital.  A Computer Tech II providing advanced tier support for Client issues and mid-level IT project support for about 30 or so IT projects.  The interview went well and I was offered the position at the end of the interview.  It’s been a good day.

Afterwards we were “talking shop” and the conversation turned to VMWare.  Apparently the hospital is in a state of transitioning away from a Citrix environment, to a VMWare based one.  I have some minor experience with VMWare having set-up a few ESXi 4 ESXi 5 servers at a college I used to work at.  Instructors could then load different OS’s and the servers would permit about 16 simultaneous OS’s to be run by students.  Instructors were pleased, happy day.

Anywho, apparently no one at the hospital really has a solid foundation in VMWare.  I talked about what minor experience I had.  They immediately called the IT Tech who is currently heading up the VMWare project.  He asked me some questions; I could answer some of them, not all of them.  I really didn’t know a lot about resource pool allocation, floating resource pools and such.  I explained I had a basic foundation in VMWare concepts, but no real enterprise level experience.

It turns out that I know more than anyone around, so I’ll do.  They basically laterally moved me on the spot.  They want someone (me) to focus down on just this project, learn the ins-and-outs of VMWare, look into the issues they’re having, and be groomed to be their go-to VMware guy from this point forward.  I basically got a promotion out of a job I was qualified for into another job I’m not really qualified for without even starting yet.

This is an exciting opportunity.  /r/vmware, I need to become a sponge.  Treat me like Pacman.  Steer me into the correct Vmware pellets.  What books should I be overnighting?  What should I start reading?  I have no problem burning through a few VMWare bibles, which ones should I focus on?  Is there an online VMWare course of some kind?

This is a total rant wall of text. but i gotta vent, i've just spent an hour and a half fixing something that should never break.

I've been working with VMware products a long time. i hold their server virtualisation products in very high regard and actively promote them. i like view and have implemented it, works great. horizon looks promising.

However, recently, i've had the displeasure of using the vCenter heartbeat product to protect vCenter and it's databases, which are hosted on windows/SQL2008R2. Due to bugs, an awful interface and general clunkiness, it has resulted in vCenter being down more than if we had just left it alone supported by regular HA.

We've had multiple occurrences of heartbeat causing issues. One particular bug filled up a tomcat log file full of superfluous information very quickly and fill the entire C: disk on vCenter, causing, you guessed it, vCenter to go down, and not fail over to the secondary because that disk was a replication target, and had filled also. awesome right? yes, that disk space should have been monitored more closely. but thats besides the point. heartbeat, the very thing that is supposed to protect vCenter, killed it.

today, it's fallen over again and i've had to fix it.

So we lost a network connection on an entire blade chassis. one connection out of two, we had full redundancy so nothing actually dropped off. all the hosts had lost one 10GB NIC out of two for a while, and all the VM's kept running. few alarms here and there. one of our vCenters was fine which thankfully kept our VDI up and running.

Except, guess what manages to somehow kill itself? the vCenter running our server infrastructure, running heartbeat, dies... how? why? because BOTH database servers (also ""protected"" by heartbeat), have somehow stopped all of their services, including the actual heartbeat service. That sure is odd. So when i restarted heartbeat, it will not, for the life of itself find a way to start the database services on either node. exasperated, i try and start them manually , and voila! SQL works just fine, there's nothing wrong with it. Now, back on the vCenter, i have to kill vpxd manually and start that, again manually because heartbeat has no idea what's going on and it's interface is completely uninformative and unintuitive. 

so, if you're thinking about heartbeat, theres my experience, i think it's rubbish, particularly considering the licensing cost. I REALLY hope that VMware are working towards a better solution for people who need highly available vCenters.

I'm trying to make a push for ESXi/vSphere at work. We're heavily dependant on AWS/EC2 right now but it is causing us some headaches.

I want to build out a small lab as a starter, to demonstrate the merits to the C-levels but the free license won't allow me to adequately create a lab that would be analogous to our workload. 

After some research, I can get by with the vSphere Essentials Kit initially. What I'm wondering is, are there any promo codes? I'm paying for this out of pocket since I have faith that it will win them over once they see it in 'production' but selling them on that cost initially is a no-go.

Any thoughts? Just want to save a few dollars until the company adopts it.

Just wanted to throw out some thoughts on the intricacies of configuring RAID-10 sets for VMFS-5 datastores (the filesystem of VMware ESXi 5.1 servers), and looking for a sanity check. It's hard to find concrete information online, so I wanted to write up some thoughts on the subject and get feedback.

##The setup:
* PERC 6/i RAID controller
* Eight 1TB 7,2k SATA drives in a RAID-10
* VMFS-5 file system
* ESX 5.1 on an internal SD card

We've been building a number of standalone ESX hosts lately, and I started wondering if I'm building them for the best performance possible given the workload. I've been reading a lot online today, and come to some conclusions about how to configure an underlying RAID-10 array to support a VMFS-5 filesystem. Opinions or advice from those of you with storage backgrounds are appreciated.

For the purposes of this post, a ""spindle"" refers to a single hard drive.

## My assumptions:
* In an 8-drive RAID 10 array, you are effectively getting 4 spindles-worth of IOPS for writes, and 8 spindles-worth of IOPS for reads.
* In a VMFS-5 filesystem, the block size is fixed at 1 MB
* In a RAID setup, you want to optimize the stripe size such that the *majority* of files/blocks are **not** either a) stored on a single drive (can create IO hotspots), or b) broken into more blocks than is necessary to obtain striping.
* Anticipated use-case drives stripe/block decisions

To me, anticipated workload of the VM's drives decisions about the underlying configuration. My primary goal is to align (pun intended) the physical RAID stripe size, VMFS-5 block size, and guest VM's filesystem blocksize such that they work together for the best performance.

I ran this one-liner to get the average size of all files on our two bare-metal CentOS file servers (which will eventually migrate onto the ESX platform):

    find / -type f -print0 | xargs -0 ls -l | gawk '{sum += $5; n++;} END {print ""Total Size: "" sum/1024/1024 "" MB : Avg Size: "" sum/n/1024 "" KB : Total Files: "" n ;}'

The results were 615 KB and 98 MB, respectively. The large skew on the second is due to a number of large data files on it, versus lots of Office documents on the first.

Because most of our files are far bigger than the default 64KB stripe size on most RAID controllers, and because we do a lot of sequential reads and writes (large backup jobs, large sequential reads loading big files, etc), I decided a larger stripe size is better. This way large files won't get broken into as many pieces, but still get broken into enough pieces to get the benefit of striping.

I decided *against* a 1024 KB (1MB) stripe size, because that would match up exactly with the VMFS-5 block size, therefor putting each block onto a single disk, which is one of the scenarios we want to avoid.

I decided on a 256 KB stripe size based on this calculation:

    4 spindles / 1 MB blocks = 256 KB stripes

To my understanding, this forces each block into 4 pieces, one piece per drive, so all 4 drives can work on a block simultaneously.

## My conclusions:
Based on the above information, I concluded:

* 256 KB stripe size on the array (4 drives/1MB blocks=256 stripes)
* Write-back on the controller
* Adaptive read-ahead on the controller
* 4 KB blocksize on Guest VM's *OS* partition (lots of little files)
* 1024 KB blocksize on Guest VM's file serving and ""big data storage"" partitions (lots of big files)

Can anyone offer any thoughts? Am I completely off base on this?

There is a severe problem when upgrading to vCenter 5.0 when you are using the Oracle 11g R2 client. The install fails with the error ""Error occurred while retrieving database version.

    Info: Beginning upgrade process....

    Error in InitVersion(): Got exception: Arithmetic operation resulted in an overflow.
    Error in GetDataseSpace(): Got exception: Arithmetic operation resulted in an overflow.
    Initialize failed, exiting...
  
This is due to a bug in the Oracle 11gR2 client. There is a patch (9966926) but this doesn't always work. In our environment the patch was applied, but it still failed because the first install attempt corrupted the database. If this happens to you, you need to downgrade to the 11gR1 client (do NOT uninstall the R2 client) and recreate your DSN entries with the older client. Remember, always take backups and have a clean, ready to go snapshot before starting.

I’m familiar with the basic concepts of virtualization having used Parallels for several years.  However, Parallels won’t accomplish what I’m trying to do.  I’m about to graduate with a B.S. in IT with a focus in Network Administration.  I’m A+, Network+, Security+, and MCTS Win7 certified and I’m now studying for the coveted MCITP Server 2008 Admin cert. (which in my area seems to be a hard requirement for a network admin position)

The labs in the MS training material (which my folks got me for Christmas) recommends a lab setup that allows 4 instances of MS Server 2008 R2 to be run simultaneously.

So… for my home lab purposes I created a HP Server with Dual Xeon 3.4GHz processors, 8GB of RAM, and 1TB of useable hard drive space.
I THINK that VMWare Server is going to accomplish what I’m after.  I downloaded VMWare VSPhere Hypeversior ESXi 4.1 and burned the ISO to disc.  I installed and configured it on the server, setting up IP configurations, passwords, etc.

So, here are a few questions that I have:

* 1.	I have a Windows7 64bit based desktop that is connected via the network to the (now) dedicated VMware server.  If I install VMWare client do I ever have to install a host OS to the dedicated HP VMWare server box?  Can’t I just run everything from the Win7 desktop?  (ie create new VM’s, manage VM’s, run VM’s etc?)
* 2.	If using the configuration detailed in #1 will I be able to run simultaneous instances of different VM’s?
* 3.	Does the client PC (the Win7 desktop) have to be running, and VMClient active to keep the VM’s on the HP server running?  I don’t understand the purpose of a dedicated VMServer if the various instances of the VM’s don’t continue to run if the VMWare client machine isn’t up?
* 4.	Am I approaching this the wrong way?  What I need is:
* a.	4 running VM’s of Server 2008 R2 that I can switch back and forth and utilize, change settings, and experiment with.  Am I on the right track?

In HP Command View we can present a LUN to multiple host initiators. In this way the LUN (disk) is presented to both HA nodes in a VMWare cluster.

For example, imagine ESX1 and ESX2 are Vmware hosts in the cluster. VMware will move the VMs on these hosts to the other host in event of host failure.
ESX1 and ESX2 both need to have the same LUN presented to them in order to ""see"" the datastores in order to bring up the VMs.

The problem comes in when on the ZFS interface as there is no way to have multiple presentations of a LUN. The initiator groups configured on the ZFS are (ESX1.a/b &lt;--&gt;ZFS) and (ESX2.a/b &lt;--&gt;ZFS), similar to the EVA. With the initiators configured as such, I can only have one host access a LUN. The ZFS will complain that the host is ""already part of an intiator group"". Oracle support indicates this is a bug in the software.

As a workaround, would it be sane to configure an initiator group consisting of all hosts in the ESX cluster and then use that to present datastore LUNs? For example, one initiator group consisting of two hosts (ESX1.a/b ESX2.a/b &lt;--&gt; ZFS)? Would this be against best practice, or even good practice?

RSYNC'ing large vmdk files (20+ GB) seem impossible to do w/o shutting down the VMs.  Can NFS shares be setup to be just raw directories so that rsync can be run on the individual files within the VM - or is it preferred to setup and run RSYNC w/in the VM itself?

I presume NFS can be setup on top of LVM, so I could utilize LVM snapshots for moment-in-time backups, so that seems like one point in favor of NFS.

Sorry to ramble.. not sure how to phrase my questions.

Can any type of remote disk/share be configured for ESXi that would allow for that share to be accessed on a file-by-file basis outside of the VM itself?

Currently they are doing VMware (3 hosts, Equalogic SAN) -&gt; Veeam on a physical machine (over network) -&gt; Physical machine's disks -&gt; Backup Exec to tape (LTO5).

Data is too big for the physical machine's storage, they get 1 full and 1-2 incrementals on it. It's about 2.4TB for a full and ~200GB for an incremental.

The client has purchased a QNAP TS-669 Pro NAS with 6x 3TB disks, hoping to use that as the Veeam destination instead (cheaper than a new server..).

My question is simple: what's the best way to configure this?

I am initially thinking of this:  
  


1) mapping the NAS to the hosts via iSCSI as one huge lun (RAID 6 rather than 10? also not sure if I should use multiple luns/targets on the NAS). 

2) creating a Windows VM and attaching it a VMDK the size of the entire NAS datastore to it

3) making the VM a Veeam proxy/repository so it can hot add VMDK disks to itself and write directly to the VMDK on the NAS lun

4) sharing the VMDK on the NAS lun via Windows to allow the physical machine with the tape drive to backup the Veeam files over the network   
  
  
I pretty much have free reign over how to configure everything involved. If I need to change something I can. However I'm not overly familiar with this stuff, so am hoping for any advice at all (even ""all wrong, start over!!"" :).  

  
Edit: I should point out it's ESXi 5.0 and a SAS tape drive that we're unable to add to hosts. Veeam is v6.1 currently with support expired, not sure we'll be able to make them get v7 (tape backup sounds great!)

- Is there a way to forcefully ""move"" a VM from a disconnected host over to a fully functional host? (NOTE: My Exchange Server is on the disconnected host **-_-** )


- Is it a good idea to shut down all the VMs, and then reboot the ESX host? If so, and the ESX host comes back but still can't be connected to VCS, what are my options?


**ANY** help is greatly appreciated!

For the vmware educational deal, located at this [web page](http://www.vmware.com/partners/academic/faqs.html) we were looking into this for a small student run security lab. We basically want to upgrade our current set up to newer software as we have run into some issues, and we are getting a hardware upgrade which we direly needed.

Current set up:

- ESXi 3.5 2 host ( no HA or DRS)

- Vcenter Server running on server 2003

- iSCSI SAN

The new set up has some new hardware and will be like this.

- ESX newest version 3 hosts

- vCenter server running on server 2008

- iSCSI SAN(beefier than current by a long shot)


This lab has like 12 to 16 students using it at a time, and will run 24/7 with at most about 50 VM's running, as we do attack defend labs (ie Red vs Blue exercises) all the time.  We are looking for HA and DRS(but from what I've seen from that edition we wouldn't get, that is only available in enterprise and higher), if we can get vMotion we can either manual move VM's when they get full, or find a way to make a plugin similar to DRS.

We don't need horizion view to look at the VM's as we consistantly switch between VM's (students will rotate through like 6 to 7 VM's in a session hardening and attacking) so we had planned on using the vSphere client that is built in and creating different users with different permissions.


Does this look like it should work? Am I missing something big that I should be paying attention to? I'm fairly familiar with  virtualization, just this is obviously a large investment and I don't want to make a simple mistake. And I figure since virtualization is only going to become more popular, I should learn how to build as well as administrate this type of infrastructure.

Fast and reliable. Thinking 2x HP DL 580 (Primary and Backup). Currently with 64Gb RAM each, although I do not know how to calculate amount of RAM needed. Also not sure what to use for storage.

High availability.

Is the DL 580 the right server for this job?
Which version of ESXi?
Is NIBLE storage a right solution, I believe SAN is required for snapshots and SRM? Alternatives?

Current setup

Prod - vCenter Std - 7 hosts for production workloads (Ent Plus), 2 hosts for vCloud Director environment (vCloud Suite Std)

DR - vCenter Foundation - 3 hosts (vSphere Std)

Proposed View architecture

Prod - Dedicated vCenter Std Server in linked mode with View Composer, View Connection Server, View Security Server in DMZ, Dedicated ESXi host

DR - Existing vCenter Foundation Server, Dedicated View Composer Server, View Replica Server? or Connection Server?, View Security Server in DMZ, Existing ESXi hosts (We are running all of 30 VMs on this environment and have 3 x dual socket quad core hosts with 144GB RAM so there is plenty of capacity for the virtual desktops and I would rather not dedicate one of them to View but will if I have to)

1338792581.0,10,self.vmware,ujuxn,Build complete.  I did it.  2 complete ESXi/FreeNAS setups for under $4K.,10,0,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/vmware/comments/ujuxn/build_complete_i_did_it_2_complete_esxifreenas/,"Hi, everybody.  This is a followup submission.  Original is [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/vmware/comments/qu1eb/4k_budget_two_esxi_servers_needed/).  The TL;DR of the original was ""I have $4K to spend on an ESXi setup, with the goal of improving our current servers' speed and fault-tolerance.""

Pretty pictures:

[switch](http://i.imgur.com/SrVxb.jpg)

I ended up mostly taking everybody's advice.  I built two complete ESXi/FreeNAS setups, a primary and a backup.  I decided to go for a ground-up build for all 4 computers.  I still firmly believe that you get more bang-for-buck that way.

I went with the same case on all four of these.  It's a cheap but serviceable 3U rackmount from Newegg (sourced nearly everything from them - obvious shill links below).  My single biggest mistake was purchasing the wrong motherboard for the backup ESXi server - ESXi doesn't support the built-in Ethernet controller (82579v).  I thought I was boned, but I found that you could [slipstream](http://www.ivobeerens.nl/2011/12/13/vmware-esxi-5-whitebox-nic-support/) the correct drivers into the ESXi iso.  This worked a champ.

So...so far, so good.  [This.](http://akridge.org/images/vmware-flowchart.png)  Just this weekend, I took the big plunge and ran Converter on *all* my remaining physical machines.  I had two VMs running already on VMware Server (on top of 2008R2).  Now, of course, the tables are turned, and R2 is running on ESXi.

Are the VMs fast?  Some are, some aren't.  RAM allocation is clearly key to speed.  In no case, though, is anything running noticeably slower than when it was a physical machine.  All 4 VMs are humming along on a single Sandy Bridge Xeon

For backups, I am currently sticking to Acronis.  I'm backing up from within the VM.  Acronis comes with the ability to restore its backup files into VMware-compatible disk images, and that's my current strategy.  I've tested it, and it works (although it's a little slow).

I went with server-class mobos for both primary servers.  This is a little overkill for the FreeNAS box, I realize.  But that mobo happens to come with a very handy IPMI feature, which grants me console access even if the computer is powered off.  FWIW, the primary FreeNAS is running RAIDz2 with 4 1TB drives, so I have an extremely fault-tolerant system with just under 2 TB of usable space (all of which I gave over to the VMware iSCSI extent).  Against all advice I was able to gather, my practical testing revealed that the regular extent is faster than the device extent, so that's what I'm using.

The buildout cost just over $4K.

So...what next?  Both ESXi servers are the free version.  Is it worthwhile to buy a VMware license of some kind?  Why or why not?  I know HA is a bonus, but a few hours of downtime won't kill our business (we're not reliant on ecommerce, for example).  Thoughts?

We had no idea we would grow to 10 hosts and over 80 virtual machines. Unfortunately one of the things we did in error, was allocate only a small ip address range for our service consoles (we are still on 4.0 due to some SAN space issues atm). So instead of having a block of ip addresses for our management consoles, we had a broken block: 192.168.0.100 - 192.168.0.105, 192.168.0.108 - 192.168.0.111.

I decided to fix this issue and consolidate down to just a solid block of 10 ip addresses and when I did so, there was apparently an issue that I only noticed recently while trying to sVMotion. We have a brand new SAN system and I was in the progress of moving some virtual machines when I got a nice little error message that said ""Unable to connect to host."" Upon further inspection I figured out that the vpxa.cfg file still retained the old ip address of the ESX host. I tired several ways to fix it as outlined in [this article](http://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?language=en_US&amp;cmd=displayKC&amp;externalId=1010837) however nothing worked until the last part. It seemed like even though I was stopping the vpx agent, editing the config file, saving it, and restarting the vpx agent the old incorrect ip address would keep populating. This meant that sVMotions would not work from this host. Fortunately the last step in the article fixed the issue.

Interesting Symptoms:

* Only sVMotion seemed to be affected. Cloning and deploying from template worked fine.
* Virtual machines could be VMotioned off of this host and sVMotioned on other ESX hosts. 
* The vpx agent would respond to the new ip address 192.168.0.107 as well as 192.168.0.108. Again this only seemed to impact sVMotion which is really strange.

Anyway, just an interesting set of issues early this morning that I thought someone might be interested in reading about. I was curious to know if anyone knew why restarting the vpxa service rewrote the vpxa.cfg every time? Any ideas why that kept happening until I completely removed the device from my environment and then rejoined it to the datacenter?",,False,self,t5_2qnan,False,,,True,t3_ndrk3,http://www.reddit.com/r/vmware/comments/ndrk3/random_interesting_vmware_thing/,

Not even close. Other than a couple linux installs running in a VirtualBox setup on my Core2Duo laptop, I have never really had the hardware to properly run virtual installs.

I have a half-rack full of PIII-era proliant servers ([see my CablePorn post here](http://www.reddit.com/r/cableporn/comments/lr9yl/slowly_cleaning_up_my_rack_vintage_porn_alert/)) that I'd like to consolidate and virtualize. They're all Windows Server 2000 (minus one that is Windows 2003). I could easily do them all with one solid box, I think (at least the PIII-era, the Xeon might be a bit trickier). 

I'm trying to come up with a proposal to pitch to my boss to consolidate all the PIII-era servers (except my firewall) into a single box. A few questions:

1. What kind of minimum CPU/RAM/other specs am I looking at to run this stuff reliably? Out of the three servers I'm wanting to replace, only one is remotely taxed (my fileserver/appserver), the rest are barely used. Total hard drive space used between all the servers is approx 350GB, at most, so I could probably do it all on a single server with a bunch of drives running a large raid array or two. How much should I expect to spend?

2. Obviously, I'd be replacing (at least) three old Proliant servers with one meatier server. I'm trying to justify to my bosses the return on investment. How much power do you think I'd be saving? All my current Proliants have multiple power supplies (2 or 3, so 8 total at the moment), and a new server would have to have redundant power supplies but consume less power than all those (I would assume). Any place I could roughly calculate that out? Any other cost benefits I can throw out there to them? My biggest thing is being able to have an image I can get back up and running on another system quickly and easily, should the baremetal of the main system go caput. While I have spare parts for all my old systems, it'd be nice if I could get something that's been made in the last decade ;-)

3. Is there a good and easy way to convert live Windows 2000 installs to images easily? I'm seen converters for Windows 2003 and above, but none of them seem to work with Windows 2000 (or a good guide somewhere)

4. Looking at what's out there, I'm a bit confused about the various VMware products. Can anybody explain the difference between them all and what they'd recommend? I'm assuming [ESXi](http://www.vmware.com/products/vsphere-hypervisor/compare.html) would do what I need, right? Like I said, my needs aren't huge, but I want something that is fairly easy to use/manage once it's all setup and running. I'm not afraid to get my hands dirty, and have managed several Linux machines via command line, but since I know squat about this stuff compared to a lot of other tech, I want to make sure my ducks are in a row :-)

All VM's are 2003, and 2008 R2.  All have the latest vmtools installed.  I'm running esxi 5.1u1 and vCenter 5.1u1 (build 1064983).

I have a vCenter with several logical datacenters.

I am running vCenter on a VM on a host in one datacenter.  The SQL server with the vCenter database is on the same host.

I need to move both VMs to a different host in a different datacenter.

All the LUNs are accessible from both hosts.

I am running standard vSwitches, not distributed.   The vSwitches on each host have the exact same portgroups set up. 

I can successfully cold migrate other guests by powering down, removing them from inventory, registering them with a new host and powering back up.

However I am not sure how to cold migrate the vCenter and SQL VMs.  

My initial thought was to power them down, connect the viClient directly to the hosts in question and delete them from inventory on the current host and register them on the new host. 

What I don't know is if the vCenter database will have a problem with the machine locations since I am making the change outside of vCenter. 

Any suggestions?

When a single VM guest is on the machine it is stupid fast.

However when more than 1 are on the host, it is slow. We're talking 6 840 pro samsung in raid-1+0. LSI with fastpath option (CTIO).

It appears the esxi host (not 5.1!) does not support SIOC and i'm not sure if that applies to DAS.

The problem I believe is that Esxi is trying to do fair scheduling of disk i/o but it's not giving thought for monstrous SSD bandwidth. 

We're talking 10x-100x faster disk i/o with a single VM on the host versus 2 more idle. 

http://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?language=en_US&amp;cmd=displayKC&amp;externalId=1027901

I read the queue lengths here and noticed the 1078 adapter queue is never getting any action. the Fastpath option of the LSI controller is a system that throttles QD1 and coalesces writes to force SSD into it's higher performing high queue depth somehow.

What i'd like (without SIOC) is to be able to let a VM to have a deeper queue. Since its DAS, why not give each VM a big chunk of that 1078 since it is designed to be resolved quickly with the massive bandwidth of the SSD and lack of latency. I think they call it micro-bursting.

Normally with a hard drive setup you might think this is crazy but when you have only one VM guest, the system hauls ass. I want this for multiple VM's. 

If I have 4 vm's, each one should be able to fill 75-100% of that 1078 queue before forcing a context switch.

I've heard using PVSCSI allows you to alter the OS queue depth to 255 (?? crazy ??).

What else do I need to do to allow deeper queue depth in the other sides?

Would going to 5.1 with SIOC fix this?

Separating each VM into separate luns? (vvols!)

We just purchased an MD1200 add-on and all the HBAs and cables required to make all the paths from server-&gt;MD3200-&gt;MD1200 redundant.  Networking is all redundant too now including management network and HA is active with all VMs in a cluster.

I'm new to large scale virtualisation, and am doing some research towards setting up a small ESXi cluster for use in test environments. It would need to support at least three concurrent test environments with at least 5 VMs each (min 15 VMs), which could be running a variety of operating systems and/or relatively complex network configurations. It would also require a backup solution to store/retrieve test VMs.

I've been researching storage options (SANs/virtual appliance), and think that a setup using vmware high-availability may not be entirely necessary for a test lab, but would appreciate some views on this.

I'm currently thinking a VMware essentials kit and a couple of high-powered servers (dual 16-core AMD bulldozer CPUs/128GB RAM) with local storage and some sort of backup system (maybe a cheap NAS or a file server) might be the most cost-effective way to go.

I'm pretty familiar with most vmware concepts and am looking for some recommendations/best practices for setting up the networking on my 3 ESX hosts. It gets confusing sometimes and I'm hoping the reddit community can lend a hand. 

I currently have vSphere 5 Essentials installed on 3 Hosts with 4 NICs in each host. We are a pretty small shop (100 employees, approximately 10-12 vms). I have all 4 ports on each server connected to a DLINK gigabit managed switch...this is where I have questions:

1. Can I team two adapters on each host for the VM's to use to talk to the rest of the network?

2. Should I dedicate one NIC in each host for management?

3. For the final NIC I was going to have that dedicated to backup the VM's to our Datto device.

4. From this main switch I have a gigabit link to another switch that all our desktops are plugged into. Is this link a bottleneck?

5. Should I pop the different networks above into their own VLANS?

There is no shared storage etc in this environment, purely networking questions. Sorry if the questions are vague, I can clarify any points if need be.

Just wanted to mention.. check out your local VMware User Group.  I went to mine yesterday (Melbourne VMUG), and it was surprisingly interesting.  I only went because my boss was presenting a lot of my work, so I wanted to be there if questions popped up, but I found the group to actually be informative and useful for someone at my level (someone who actually plays with VMware, not just management-level).

Just to rundown:

- They had a boring salesy talk from Cisco for their UCS product, but I think it was boring because we already have UCS implemented and running.  Others had lots and lots of questions for the Cisco guy, so it must have been pretty useful for the majority.
- After the UCS preso, they had 10 tech questions in 10 minutes, where all the VMware employees there (I counted about 5 or 6 with different roles, but definitely tech-side) went to the front and took questions.  The format was very loose and I'm pretty sure it went over 10 minutes, and wasn't 10 questions.  It started with a few people asking some *more* questions to the Cisco guy, but then got into some VMware stuff.  I can't remember the questions, but at one point they quieted down, so the group up the front went to one of the ones they said they've been asked before.  They threw it up on the screen (it was RDMs vs VMDKs, I think.. can't remember) and that started another 10 minutes of hardcore VMware storage discussion, which even had the VMware employees correcting each-other once or twice as they bounced around from topics like NFS vs SAN to local disk vs boot from san vs PXE (what we do).
- After that, my boss did his presentation on how we've implemented vSphere on our UCS platform, and some things we've found with UCS in general.  It seemed to do fine.
- After that was pizza and soft drink, then done.

It was a good way to spend half a day, and definitely more technical than I thought it'd be.  It was also quite a bit larger than I thought, with 100ish technical VMware people there from companies large and small.

They're doing quarterly meetings, and they're planning on doing a one-day user summit sometime mid-year, which I'm going to try to get to.

Anyways, just wanted to say.. it seemed highly technical, and highly useful.

1294965582.0,8,self.vmware,f1wtc,How to Patch ESXi 4.1,10,2,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/vmware/comments/f1wtc/how_to_patch_esxi_41/,"This is painful for those of you on 4.0 and you make the transition because in 4.1 you can no longer use the GUI HOST Update Utility. (especially if like me you are a Windows GUI Background)

Therefore, you have to patch from the command line.

Here is how I did it.

Download the patches for ESXi4.1 Embedded and Installable from
http://www.vmware.com/patch/download/
There are two at the time of posting this.

ESXi410-201010001 - Posted 15th Nov 2010

and

ESXi410-201011001 - Posted 29th Nov 2010

Download the CLI which at time of writing was posted 13th Jul 2010
http://www.vmware.com/support/developer/vcli/

It is best to re-boot once the cli installed, even if it does not prompt you to.

Copy the two patches above from your downloaded location to this directory

C:\Program Files\VMware\VMware vSphere CLI\bin

Now open the CLI and browse to the bin directory, your command prompt should show

C:\Program Files\VMware\VMware vSphere CLI\bin&gt;

The process is thus;

You need to list each update and then apply each bulletin contained within the update.  You don't need to re-boot the host until you have applied all your updates.

Let us assume, HOST is 192.168.1.10, Username is root and Password is redditvmware

Connect via the vSphere client, shut down any VM's and enter Maintenance mode.

Open the CLI at C:\Program Files\VMware\VMware vSphere CLI\bin&gt; and type

&gt;perl vihostupdate.pl --server 192.168.1.10 --username root --password redditvmware -b ESXi410-201010001.zip -l

The above will list the bulletins contained within, there are two for this update

Now apply the bulletins to patch the host, can take a couple of minutes

&gt;perl vihostupdate.pl --server 192.168.1.10 -i -b ESXi410-201010001.zip -B ESXi410-201010401-SG

You will be prompted for Username and Password and the update will apply.

Now apply the second bulletin for VMTools

&gt;perl vihostupdate.pl --server 192.168.1.10 -i -b ESXi410-201010001.zip -B ESXi410-201010402-BG

You will again be prompted for Username and Password and the update will apply.

Now list the second update (as of Reddit Posting date 14th Jan 2011)

&gt;perl vihostupdate.pl --server 192.168.1.10 --username root --password redditvmware -b ESXi410-201011001.zip -l

and patch the bulletin contained within

&gt;perl vihostupdate.pl --server 192.168.1.10 -i -b ESXi410-201011001.zip -B ESXi410-201011401-BG

Now you can re-boot the host and Exit Maintenance mode on start up.
Your ESXi 4.1 Host is patched.

Just getting settled into vSphere 5.1 Standard with vCenter.

I was getting ready to setup my vCenter server today, and since I knew I wasn't going to need my root password for the box anymore (except for recovery purposes obviously), I might as well set it to something nice and complex for extra security.

I generated a 64-char password, 4 char classes (upper, lower, num, and special chars).  I logged into vSphere directly to that host with root, then changed the root password under ""Local Users and Groups"".

Finally, I logged out and went to log back in to verify my new password, and it didn't work.  Tried the old root password, it didn't work.  Tried a blank root password, maybe it reset to default?  NOPE!

---

So, now I'm stuck with a host that can't be accessed, via vSphere OR via the console.  Machines are running fine, just can't manage them!

As I see it, I really have 2 options:

* A) Reinstall ESXi.  I have 2 separate datastores, System on a RAID1 array, and Data (where all VMs live) on a RAID5 array.  As I understand it, I should be able to ""repair"" ESXi on the system partition, get it up and running, and then mount the ""data"" datastore from the other array and import the VMs from there.  At that point, all should be running again.  Is this accurate?  Is this reliable?

* B) Attempt to ""hack"" the system.  The comments on [this page](http://vm-help.com/esx/esx3i/Reset_root_password.php) seem to indicate that while this is an older procedure, it still works on 5.1, although it's not easy by any means.  I'm really hoping option A is something realistic, this method intimidates me a little!

* C) Community option!  Is there some magic bullet that Google didn't reveal?

---

Finally, after I've recovered from this mess: what's a good standard for root password?  Servers are physically secure, and the firewall limits management access to the machine, but in case all else fails, I'd like someone to have to struggle a little bit before breaking in!  64 chars seems to be overkill, so what's a nice happy medium that doesn't kill ESXi?

Thank you all for your help, I apologize for what (at least in my mind) seems like such a n00b question!

---

**EDIT:** Tried this on a spare host with an identical setup, and re-installing ESXi did exactly what I would expect it to do.  Both datastores were kept intact (I had a few OS ISOs loaded on the system datastore, it was a pleasant surprise that they were still on the disk), and I was able to reconnect the VMs from the other datastore in about 30 seconds.  All in all, about 45 minutes to get back to a usable state.

None of the other VMs are even close to using up their provisions (or are even running) and I have no snapshots stored.

edit: Just noticed that the .vmdk it says there's no room for doesn't exist in the datastore. (?!) WinServer.vmdk is there, but the file mentioned in the error message is WinServer_2.vmdk.

edit2: Suppose this should have been obvious, but the _2.vmdk in question is one of the two drives I use for a share drive. I have two 2TB drives the Windows Server uses to host files in a mirrored configuration. Disk1 shows ~1.3TB used and Disk2 shows ~1.95 used. What would account for the mismatch? Windows Server (w/in the host) confirms the ~1.3TB usage so there's about 650GB unaccounted for on the 2nd .vmdk.

We use Veeam and there's a known issue where CTK files might not be removed if a backup or replication job fails. The end result is a VM that has loads of snapshots associated with it and no means of them being removed. Veeam does have some recommendations for clearing these but they didn't work in our instance so we reverted to a backup since the vc database is hosted elsewhere.

The restore was fine however when powering on the server for the first time the server didn't appear to have network drivers installed and as such didn't show a working NIC. IF you tried to access the NIC settings within the OS (2008R2) it would just show a blank window.

No problem I thought. I'll just remove and re-add the NIC on the VM settings, however this too didn't work. Change the NIC to E1000 since that doesn't require VMtools? nope, no change. VMtools perhaps? Nope, it wouldn't let me re-install that either the server would just sit idle. Essentially I had a VM that couldn't have a NIC.

Only then did everything start to work. As far as I can tell this has only happened with vcenter VM's that have been restored.

I'd be curious to know if anyone else has hit this. 

TL;DR - restored vCenter server VM needs to have IP settings re-added via command line for no apparent reason. OS seems completely stuffed up as control panel windows won't open etc until IP settings are corrected.

**Edit for anyone from the future:**

This issue is to do with VMXNET3. Install [this patch](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2526142) before you restore the VM",,False,self,t5_2qnan,1369005829.0,,,True,t3_1e7f79,http://www.reddit.com/r/vmware/comments/1e7f79/bit_of_a_curly_one_restored_vcenter_server_vm_not/,

I'm hoping someone can provide some clarification regarding SR-IOV. From what I've read, SR-IOV allows you to create 'virtual functions' from a physical NIC, allowing the OS to see them as individual NICs. When I looked into SR-IOV with VMware, it seems like everyone is using it to pass-through these 'virtual functions' to the guest OS, such as Linux or Windows 2008 R2.

My question is as follows: Can I use these virtual functions on vSwitches or dVS? The VMware 5.1 documentation says that after implementing SR-IOV, the physical NIC becomes unavailable for vSwitches, but says nothing regarding using virtual functions.

The use case/idea (and I may be totally off) would be to segment a 10GBe NIC into 4 x 3.5GB links, so that I can run things like vMotion and iSCSI off the same physical NIC, but not have them competing for bandwidth.

I know Broadcom has something similar called NPAR, but am really not familiar with the details and differences between their offering and Intel's.",,False,self,t5_2qnan,False,,,True,t3_1ciud2,http://www.reddit.com/r/vmware/comments/1ciud2/sriov_question/,

The DR site isn't as robust as our main data center, so we can only run critical infrastructure.  While I was pricing new hardware to replace our current ESX hosts I started thinking about using the Replication feature released in 5.1 to create an onsite DR.  My idea being that if we don't have a complete site failure, say just the NAS, then instead of going through the hassle of bringing up the cold remote site, I can spin up the same critical servers stored on the ESX Hosts themselves.    

Has anyone done something like this? Does this sound like a good idea?  Am I just making more headaches for myself?  There are a couple of issues I haven't worked out yet, like exactly how to get the changes replicated to the DR site in case we had a long term outage (we do not have SRM, we use the mirroring capabilities of the NAS to copy the LUNs to the DR site).  Also I haven't decided whether to forgo vMotion and HA in such a scenario and use each host independently or use something like vSA to make a mini-NAS between the hosts.

  I have a number of LUNs configured for a particular client. Three LUNs with different sizes host 50 VMs. These VMs can be anything from Web, file to SQL servers. Between those three LUNs, there is around 9.55 TB of free space that I need to recapture.

  The plan for the moment is to empty out the smaller LUN into the next biggest LUN. Delete that LUN and recreate it with the proper size and then move VMs back. Since there is enough disk space between three, I'm sure its technically possible.

  The question I have for the group is:

* How much overhead is necessary for a VM in order to size the LUN?

Does anyone use a VM based backup system and with it, protect vRDMs? If so does your backup software support change block tracking and therefore incremental backups? Are these backups white space aware?

I am using HP Data Protector and after talking with Data Protector they are certain that incremental backups should be supported on vRDMs. I pinged VMware about it and they said that cbt is available for vRDMs and they pointed me at [this article](http://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?language=en_US&amp;cmd=displayKC&amp;externalId=1020128).

Why am I asking these questions? Well we elected to put one of our main applications on a vRDM. The drive we placed on the vRDM is a 1.5 terabyte image drive that stores millions of small tif images. I ran a full backup (which took approximately 10 hours) which ended up being 1.5 terabytes as expected. I then immediately followed the full with an incremental (that took 10 hours as well) and it too was also 1.5 terabytes. 

I checked the normal things:

* **Is incremental backup working at all in the environment?** Yes. VMDK files seem to be incrementally backing up.
* **Is incremental backup working on the other drives for the virtual machine in question?** Yes, the operating system partition and the program files partition are vmfs based and their incremental backups are working as expected.
* **Do you see the ctk file corresponding to the vRDM?** Yes. My vRDM (the pointer at least) is labeled server03_2.vmdk and the cbt file is labeled server03_2-ctk.vmdk and it's approximately 6,144kb. It's also time stamped 30 seconds later then the vmdk file.
* **Can you get change block tracking on a vRDM to work elsewhere in the environment?** No. I setup a quick demo on a 10 gig vRDM on a test PC and it's not working there either. 

I would appreciate hearing some other's thoughts on this. Thanks in advance.

**Edit:** Down vote out the gate? Why?

**Edit2:** Just a little update. So apparently it looks like ESXi, while appearing to be tracking the change blocks on the VMs, is actually not doing this for the vRDMs. The Data Protector group inspected the CBT databases for my vRDMs and they revealed that while the databases were being established, there apparently wasn't any information being actually tracked inside of them. I spoke with VMware and they've forwarded the ticket over to the SDK group and they are going to look into the VDDK and figure out what's going on. For those of you interested here is what the HP Data Protector group relayed:

&gt; Please notice that this extract shows, for each disk involved in this backup, the change blocks  as reported by VMware vSphere QueryChangedDiskAreas() API.  
As we can see, Data Protector is backing up what this QueryChangedDiskAreas() API is giving (Data protector relies on vmware API for this action) and 
therefore the problem doesn't seem  to be a Data Protector problem but a Vmware one. Please notice that you can execute the same API outside Data 
protector using MOB ( http://&lt;your virtual center&gt;/mob):
1- First get the change information, by browsing the ""http://&lt;your virtual center&gt;/mob"" link to follow path:
    content -&gt; ha-folder-root -&gt; ha-datacenter -&gt; datastore -&gt; vm -&gt; snapshot -&gt; config -&gt; hardware &gt; virtualDisk.
  Notice that Changed block tracking is associated with the snapshot, not with the base disk

&gt; 2- 
   a- use the procedure described in the follwng kb to access the virtual machine:
         http://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?language=en_US&amp;cmd=displayKC&amp;externalId=1017126
   b- Once in the page called :
          Managed Object Type: ManagedObjectReference:VirtualMachine 
          Managed Object ID: vm-xxx
      click on ""QueryChangedDiskAreas"" link to open the QueryChangedDiskAreas() API invocation  page.

&gt;    c- use the information collected in step 1 to  fill out the API argument, then clikc on ""Invoke Method"":

&gt; If you need more detail on how the work can be found in the following link:
    http://pubs.vmware.com/vsphere-50/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.vmware.vddk.pg.doc_50%2FvddkBkupVadp.9.3.html
    section: ""Changed Block Tracking on Virtual Disks""

&gt; Please notice also that there is a known QueryChangedDiskAreas() API defect (Vmware side):
   http://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?language=en_US&amp;cmd=displayKC&amp;externalId=2039052
where QueryChangedDiskAreas call incorrectly returns the entire thin-provisioned disk!!

&gt; As you can see the problem seems to be in Vmware side, however,  I have opened a lab call to see if they can come with 
A better procedure to demonstrate the problem outside Data protector.
I’ll let you know as soon as I hear from them.

1. Should I apply them to just one host for testing?  Will the DRS/HA cluster still work with the different patches in place?  Or is it better to apply the patches cluster-wide?

2. Should I apply them one-at-a-time, or all at once?

3.  Most of these patches require a reboot.  Will the host restart after each patch, or will it reboot after all the patches have been applied?

Is it correct that with ESXi 5 update 1, they set a licensing block on hosts with more pRAM than purchased entitled vRAM?

It has an old Pervasive SQL instance and a dos based client that accesses the data. The system was replaced with a different system a very long time ago but the people in charge of that department need to retain the system for some time for record keeping but for reasons out of my control the old P.SQL data will never be migrated to the new MSSQL based system. So I am just keeping it alive until it is no longer needed.

So my thought was to emulate the old server in a VM. I am not very familiar with VMware and really this is going to be my first time playing with it. I just downloaded vsphere and I could use lots of advice. One big question is can I image the old NT server and load that into a VM without manually re-installing the OS and then the SQL and applications. I am concerned that I wont have the proper install media forget finding decade + old license materials.

From my perspective I am guessing it all comes down to drivers and will NT operate under vmware and would the existing instal be able to make the transition from a one hardware drive set to another. Also heads up, the only box I have available for this is a win2008r2 with 8 gigs ram, core2quad Q6700. It is slated to be replaced soon but in the mean time am I asking too much from it?

Thank you in advance.

**EDIT: This is solved, what I did incase someone stumbles upon this and needs direction, I imaged to system using VCenter 3.0.3 over the network to a server. I then had a vmkd of the old nt box.

As far as I'm aware, the only difference between the number of virtual sockets and number of virtual cores per socket of a VM would be how it affects some software licensing.  e.g., a VM with 4 virtual sockets / 1 virtual core would take up four times as much licensing than a VM with 1 virtual socket / 4 virtual cores.  However, there would be no difference in cpu performance.

Is this true?  Are there any other performance details or best practices about this?

At the moment I've got ESXi (the free one) running on a few DL380's which is going really well, but I'm missing some of the cooler features - like being able to move a server from one host to another.  Some of the resilience features (like having a guest on two hosts at the same time) would be nice too, but really I just want to get the firm to dip it's toe in to some of the benefits of virtualisation so I can convince them this is the way forward.

So the question:

Do I need a licence for each host?

If I'm in the UK - does anyone know how much this is?

What do I need to know / look for when buying.  What benefits will I see over the free one?

As a little background: I've got an array on the SAN with a few LUNs on it, and that array is WAY oversubscribed right now. Performance has been poor for VMs on any of the LUNs that are on that array. But it culminated yesterday with a critical VM that does a lot of disk reads and writes hitting a performance level that was starting to cause timeouts and issues during production hours. It kept getting worse, so we made the decision to start Storage vMotioning it off to a new array that was finally got carved out.

SVM was going along, but I started getting reports that performance was getting even worse. It's a Linux box, so I did a quick top. Load averages were cresting 100.0. It appeared that the SVM may have been the culprit, so we decided to cancel the SVM. Except, it didn't actually stop and performance got worse and worse. Before too long, top was showing load averages of 170 and it was impossible for anyone else to log into the server anymore.

Got on the phone with support, and they had me manually restart the management services on the host. According to the tech, this would effectively kill the SVM copy. We did that, and nothing changed with performance but the SVM task did finally die.  However, there was a rogue copy of our VM sitting out there in a powered off state with a (1) at the end of the name. The tech said it was probably an orphaned copy of our VM that was most likely inconsistent. I figured I'd deal with it later.

Load averages on the guest were still climbing. VMware blamed it on the SAN - which I didn't totally buy. I knew we were oversubscribed, but the biggest issues didn't start until the SVM began. Only thing I could think of to do was to evacuate the host and reboot it, thinking maybe that something on the host was hosed up and causing issues. I was still able to (very slowly) do regular vMotions to other hosts, so I started manually moving everything off the host. I finally got down to just my problem VM left on that host, and I crossed my fingers and started a vMotion of it. It almost immediately errored out, with a message that there was already a migration in progress. I went to research the error, and about 5 minutes later I looked back at the vCenter Client, and the original VM was now in a powered off state, and the ""copy"" of the VM (the one with the (1) at the end) was now the one running. And the really scary thing? It was running off of the new SAN volume. The original VMDK on the oversubscribed volume was gone.

This really freaked me out because according to VMware, the disk migration should have never completed, so the target VMDK was probably inconsistent. The SVM had supposedly terminated over 5 hours before this point. So even if by some miracle it actually had completed on its own before we restarted the management services, it would be an old copy of the data from 5 hours ago.

But, everything I'm looking at shows that the VM is consistent, is not missing any data at all (/var/log/messages on the VM shows consistent log entries all through the day with no gaps) and running perfectly. I called VMware back... they have no explanation for how this happened. Anyone here have any ideas or thoughts?

We do have a san that can be active/active when mirrored but even if we would have an active/passive san the same principles would apply for the most part.

The two sites would be linked with two or three data connections for both san and network traffic.

Few scenarios

* Hardware or power fails on one site. HA kicks in and boots everything that was running in that site on the site that is still working. All is well.

* All 2-3 links between the sites go down. HA kicks in and we have a split brain situation.

  If we have an active/active san, can vSphere detect if a vm is already running on the other site?

  If we have an active/passive san then paths from the ESXi serves on one site to the san is lost so HA on the site with the active san would start to boot everything up. When the passive san detects it has lost its connections it should become active and then vSphere detects the SAN is online again and HA would try to boot everything up. Is that the correct understanding?

This is possible to do by editing the External network and adding an additional network, but because this is mapped to a single Port group my understanding is that we will be required to export all of those subnets on the same VLAN, something our network guys are frowning at.

I have been having issues with multiple vm's were DRS will move a vm from a 5.1 host to a 4.1 host and the network adapters will just stop functioning.  Windows thinks the nic is there with the status of connected. It even has it's static IP and everything like it should.  The machine will not ping or talk in any fashion.  I have tried disable/enable, repair the nic all to no avail.  The only way i can get it to come back is by adding in a new nic.  I have seen this happen with the e1000 nic as well as vmxnet3. I was so lucky tonight that DRS picked up and moved my Exchange server from a 5.1 host to a 4.1 and it goes down and all hell breaks lose.  All vm's are hardware version 7 and from everything i have read it is a supported configuration to have 4.1 and 5.1 host in the same cluster (especially while upgrading) 

At this point I have no idea why this is happening. Have any of you seen this?  I just turned DRS to Manual so nothing can move with out my say so.  Any suggestions are welcome, if you need more info just ask.  VMware support is not helpful I opened a ticket the 1st time this happened on Tuesday, I uploaded the logs he asked for and the tech claims he doesn't see a problem and he refuses to call me back or answer my emails.

The VM has 1 nic assigned to our DMZ network, yet in its summary page, it shows that it's connected to both our DMZ network AND our production network.  I'm not sure how that's possible (it's probably something stupid that I'm overlooking), but here's what I've found in troubleshooting.

- removing the nic removes the reference to the DMZ network, the production network reference remains

- the host configuration tab &gt; networking shows the VM on both the production and DMZ port groups

- I cold migrated a similar server to the 5.1 environment to see if I could duplicate the behavior and I can't.  The similar server only shows a reference to the DMZ network

- Poking around the .vmx file only shows a reference to one nic, so there's no garbage in there from a previous setting or something

- upgrading vmware tools and hardware version had no effect

- migrating to a different host had no effect

- by all indications, the guest OS sees only 1 nic (in the DMZ)

- nothing out of the ordinary like RDM's or other odd connections

- the vm hardware list is the usual: cpu, memory, hd1, scsi controller, 1 network adapter (dmz), cd drive (not connected), vid card, vmci device.

Initially I thought that maybe it had to do with vShield endpoint, but that doesn't seem to be the case.  At least not so far as the endpoint drivers in the vmware tools install are concerned.

Hey /r/vmware

I'm working on drawing up a VDI (Horizon View) solution for my organization. One of the sticking points is IOPS (no real surprise here). Determining IOPS for VDI (designing a ramp from 200 to 1200 users over the next 3 years) really is starting to feel like an expensive, educated guessing game.

Here's a little context:

My original path was to simply upgrade my existing SAN from an HP4500 to the mid-ranged 3PAR 7400 and rely on numerous SAS-drives for IOPS to handle the replica and linked-clones.

However, my research has led me to Fusion-IO technology. I recall hearing about Fusion-IO at last year's VMWorld and was impressed.

Now for my questions:

- Anyone using Fusion-IO technology in a production environment? 
- If so, what are your professional opinions on the cards?
- If I had 4 IO-cards installed in 4 blades could I not use VSA to bundle  each card into a single shared storage volume and then be able to off load my replicas and linked-clones to the VSA-based shared storage?
  - This solves the problem of not being able to take advantage of HA / DRS because the Io-card storage is LOCAL to each blade so I'd lose that resiliency.",,False,self,t5_2qnan,1365733323.0,,,True,t3_1c5fin,http://www.reddit.com/r/vmware/comments/1c5fin/a_few_questions_planning_out_a_vdi_implementation/,

I have 2 questions that I'm having difficulty finding answers for :


1.) Can I just replace the vCenter server &amp; vsphere web client + log browser SSL certificates, or do I need to replace all 6 service certificates? (SSO, Inventory Service, etc.)

2.) All of the certificates being generated are identical, appart from the OU (Organization Unit) - How do I go about ordering this with my SSL vendor with all the CN's (Common Names) being identical? Is this a supported feature of signing certificates?


Any help would be greatly appreciated.






UPDATE : I was able to get around this issue by deploying 2 nginx load balancers with heartbeat and pacemaker for high availability. I did SSL Offloading on the loadbalancer - thus all clients accessing the web interface now see a trusted, signed certificate. I also had to update the endpoint in the Inventory Services database.

Basically, DRS got set from Manual to Automatic, somehow, so that when the vCenter server came back up, it immediately began DRSing VMs.

The issue was that the Nexus 1000v had not signed in to publish the dvSwitches yet, so the DRS'd machines lost their NIC configurations and connectivity to the production IP network. 

We've set the DRS config back to Manual, but since it seemingly set itself to Automatic after the reboot, we're looking for some insurance to keep this from happening again.


Does anyone know if it is possible to force DRS operations to wait a set amount of time before being executed, after a reboot? We're looking to give the 1000v time to get signed in before DRS jobs begin.

When the second guest boots (assuming it is the same OS, release, patch levels and such) the dlls aren't necessarily loaded into the hypervisor memory again.  This would permit the 2 guests to run off of the same files in memory (again, assuming they're the same).

2. What is the best method for capturing an image of a running server (hardware server) and virtualizing it? The image has to make it's way to the datastore of course. Is there any way to capture it directly to the datastore, or does it have to be ""uploaded""?

3. Converting MS Hyper-V .vhd servers? Easier way than just capture the running image?

4. vCenter? What does it do. So far we've only messed with vSphere Client, and it seams to do it all.

So, power died, an hour later the UPS died and the host died with it along with that half of our storage cluster.

HA did its thing and fired up the VMs on the host in the remaining room but at the point that HA kicked in we had no domain controllers since both were down due to the outage (of course usually I would not run both DCs on the same host but figured sooner that than run production VMs with no UPS cover at all).

This led to lots of fun dependency stuff where all the VMs were restarted by HA but it was pot luck whether the DCs had spun up by the point any given VM came back.

Is there any way with any edition of VMware to put in dependencies?

We have 5 VMware host systems (3 standalone boxes w/ local storage &amp; a blade system with an internal ""SAN""). I say SAN in quotes b/c the storage system is only accessible to the blades, but between blades it works just like a normal SAN would.

We've looked at SANs in the past and my company just doesn't want to shell out the money for one. Whatever. I'm past that. We use Veeam Backup &amp; Replication to replicate critical VMs between hosts, which is essentially as good as HA, FT, vMotion, Storage vMotion, etc, without the added licensing cost.

Anyway, to the point: Hyper-V w/ Server 2012 supports live migration between hosts that aren't using shared storage. This alone was reason enough for me to consider switching to Hyper-V. However, vSphere 5.1 will support this too. Here's the problem, though: Our blade systems are running the most recent version of ESXi. Our 3 standalone hosts are running 4.1. The reason for this is that they're using Adaptec RAID controllers that aren't supported fully with v5. By this I mean they'll work fine, but I can't manage the RAID controller at all. With ESX 4.1 I've installed the Adaptec management RPM and I can manage them just fine.

Hyper-V supports full management of the RAID controllers on those 3 systems. We own vSphere Essentials currently, which costs a wopping $90/year from VMware, so cost isn't a big issue here. With Hyper-V we'd have to purchase Windows 2012 for all the systems (I don't want to use the free version). We'd have the opportunity to purchase Datacenter edition and have ""free"" server VMs for the forseeable future. Plus, we could have live VM migration without any additional hardware purchases.

I guess my question is this: what are the caveats of switching from VMware to Hyper-V? I know we'll need to purchase System Center VMM 2012 SP1 to manage the hosts, which is pricey, by well worth it if it means we can add as many hosts as we want in the future without needing to purchase extra shared storage.
Ideally I'd buy a $20k SAN with all the needed redundancy, hook all my VMs up to that, and stick with VMware, only because I've dedicated 4+ years of my life to VMware and know it pretty darn well. Its pretty stable and effective. However, I work for accountants, and they fail to understand why the $20k investment in a proper SAN would be best, and I've lost the desire to fight for it.

I have 3 HP DL 360 G5 servers that are running vSphere 4.1 esxi free edition.  The servers are used for a QA environment. They have DAS local storage.
 
I have read the upgrade guide and what it seems to me is -
 
Shut down all guest vms

Enter maintenance mode

Boot the physical server from the vSphere 5 CD

Select upgrade and retain my VMFS datastore and settings.

Wait - reboot - everything should work seamlessly.
 
What is scaring the life out of me is that in the upgrade guide, Section Upgrading Environments without Host Clusters, Page 165 - point 4 it says

""In case of upgrade failure, the process does not support rollback to the previous release""
 
It is a real pain, both in time and in required extra storage space in having to SCP or extract all the VMs on these hosts before I perform the upgrade.  I might as well back them all up, wipe the environment and start from fresh and I don't want to do this.

I'm trying to replace a random assortment of garbage sata drives with some kind of shared storage for a homebrew (read: I'm not going to drop the cost of a vehicle on this) setup.

I was originally looking at using FreeNAS with NFS shares talking to ZFS Datasets. However from what I'm reading lots of people have tried this and had horrible experiences with it due to ESXi forcing sync writes all over the place.

2 questions come to mind:

1: Have any of you used FreeNAS with NFS running off ZFS datasets *with a ZIL running on SSD drives* and gotten reasonable performance? The ZIL detail is the one thing I've not seen in many posts. What's your setup if so?

2: Have any of you used FreeNAS with iSCSI running off ZFS volumes and gotten reasonable performance? What's your setup if so?

e: On a complete side note, the fact that you can't tell ESXi to use an iso image on your local computer unless the guest is actually running combined with the fact that the chance to hit esc to choose boot devices has about a half second window on top of the fact that if you boot a guest it will disconnect the iso image (and pop a nice big obnoxious window in your face that you have to click off, which will cause you to miss hitting esc) is quite possibly the most obnoxious thing I've ever seen in my life.",,False,self,t5_2qnan,1339999342.0,,,True,t3_v70ug,http://www.reddit.com/r/vmware/comments/v70ug/how_nicely_does_freenas_play_with_esxi/,

I'm a novice ESX admin with a vSphere 4.1 custer with three hosts. 8 cores each with hyperthreading, 48, 72, and 72gb of RAM, and shared storage.

I'm having weird behavior where the cluster wants to move everything off of host 2 and just put it all on host 1 and 3.  The target host load standard deviation is .244, and the host load standard deviation is .314, so the cluster's imbalanced.  My migration threshold is set to apply priority 1 and 2 recommendations.

What's worse, when I try to manually vmotion some machines off host 1 (the one with less memory) to host 2, vSphere tells me it can't vmotion the machine because it couldn't balance memory reservations or that no compatible host has sufficient resources to satisfy the reservation.  Outside of a few resource pools set up by a consultant, nothing's using any reservations that I know of.

I was able to vmotion a couple of things to host 3, but one of them automatically vmotioned back to host 1, setting the host's memory consumption to 83%.  Host 2 is sitting at about 8% memory consumption; it's got a single VM running on it, and I can't seem to vmotion anything onto it.

Edit: I also have a DRS fault. ""Could not balance memory reserves"" on host 2.  It tried to move the single running VM from host 2 to host 1, but there isn't sufficient RAM on host 1.  I'm not sure why it's not trying to move the VM to host 3.

Edit 2: I found there's a single VM on host 2 that has a ""Worst Case Allocation"" set to 68GB of RAM, which is almost all of what's in two of the three hosts.  I can't edit the ""Worst Case Allocation"" amount, but I think that's what's causing the whole problem.

Benefits are known stable server board, has Vt-d, and solid IPMI working. Downside is, it's not the NEW STUFF BABY. It's not Ivy Bridge and not the brand new Z77 chipset. And ram is very expensive. In fact, probably can only afford 16 (4x4) because 4x8gb sticks is very expensive.

Option 2. Since doing this in May 2012, this just happens to fall a month after the release of new chipset, Z77, and 3rd generation Ivy Bridge CPUs. Nice. The new ASRock Extreme Micro ATX board support Vt-d. YES. Brand new off the press 3770 Intel i7 support hyper threading and Vt-d with this board. Yes. And, desktop 32 gig is way cheaper compared to option 1. But, no DRAC/IPMI/vKVM at all. Cannot recover remotely from failure. But, not a data center...just my home server so this seems fine.

Option 3. Just saw this and kinda leaning towards this now. The new gamer overclocking Z77 chipset has a new younger brother workstation chipset Q77. And, it has vPRO support in the chipset (depending on CPU, this is like IPMI). And combined with the new i7 3770S or regular, I can get IPMI functionality to rebuild OS remotely. Yeah! And there is only one ASRock motherboard for Q77 yet for sale on newegg, but no reviews yet. Ok, I'll be the first to buy it I decide. I start to piece it together and then go over to ASRock.com to lookup compatible memory, and not a single 8gb stick is listed. ARGH!!! I figure some 8gb stick will work, but how is one to know. And now I'm stuck. Don't need 32, but when I'm capped at less than the max allowed, I second guess myself.

Also connection is PCoiP. Connection Server and vSphere/ESX and the thin client are all on separate networks. 

I have one pool setup. It's setup as an automated pool, user assignment is floating. We have a windows 7 template that it uses to create a fresh desktop each time. I have it setup so that there is always at least 2 spares ready for when my NOC has to login. 

What is happening is that I have my first shift guys test it. So they get in at 7am and leave at 3pm. Works like a champ during the day while they are on it. Dual monitors (the reason for PCoiP) look great, everything just works beautiful. Now here's the problem. They come in the next day and go to login and they cannot.

I was thinking maybe some fellow redditors might have some input. I want to clone a VM that's running a production payroll system. The app is going to have a major update applied to it and I would like to test out the upgrade prior to running it in production. I was going to use the ""clone"" feature in vCenter, however I got thinking about the ramifications. The server is a win2k3 on an AD domain. If I were to clone the server, power on the clone, rename/apply a new ip, then rejoin it to the domain everything ""should"" be ok except for the Windows SIDs. Should I worry about that? Is there a better best practice to do this sort of thing? I don't really want to rebuild a QA server from scratch as the app would take many days of patching to mirror the production box. 

Update 5/10: I went ahead with dalan's and wazoo9000's suggestions. I went ahead and did a cold clone with the customization option during the task.

A coworker and I administer our small/medium sized environment which is approximately 90% virtualized.  We made the switch about four years ago and have benefited greatly.  We are the ""choir"" and don't need to be sold on VMware; we need to know about techniques or emerging virtual technology/practices or how to better leverage our existing equipment.

I have attended local VM user group conferences and found them to be more of sales pitches rather than helpful information.  Having vendors pay to present makes these meet-ups free so I can deal with hearing about how Product X will save my soul.  

I realize VMware partners will be at VMworld and they want to sell us their products but if the presentations/sessions/labs are thinly veiled sales pitches I will be disappointed.  Are there going to be vendor-neutral sessions and labs or is it going to be ""Session X - Presented [VENDOR X]"" where they spend 2 minutes talking about a general problem and the next hour talking about their specific product?

Spending a day at local user group for free is one thing, I can handle the vendor spam.  If my boss has to pay to fly me to Vegas, stick me in a hotel, and pay for the conference it is another matter entirely.

It's been a long month, but I finally have news for everyone who wanted a follow up.  To recap, about two months ago I posted asking for ideas on how to speed up our use of scanners in remote sites.  After View 4.6 dropped, it was suggested by VMWare to update.  That meant a full update of everything from VSphere to Composer, to View.  

  So here is where I stand now, and I hope that this helps.  First, Use PCoIP if you have any USB devices.  When I went to 4.6, I forced everyone to go to RDP at a suggestion from the VMWare tech that I talked to while doing the upgrade.  RDP is great if you do not use USB redirection.  Second, we bumped up the QoS on port 32111 which is the USB redirection port.  And of course, everyone is now on the 4.6 client and agent.

  So, what was the end results? Scanning at the site with the 3.5Mbit MPLS is 6-10 seconds for an insurance card.  At the far site with a 1.5 TI Scanning is about the same, maybe even a bit faster than that (Fewer end users at that site which may be why).  People are happy, and that is all that matters.

 I love the View product, and the USB scanning problem was the only thing that I had to knock against it.

Servers we had ESXi 4.1 running flawlessly on.  We are preparing for an upgrade and are ""playing"" with 5.1.0a.  Everything goes as expected except when it comes time to adding additional networks.  We usually have 4.  

Management, vMotion, FAS, Clients/Data and something along the lines of 10.10.30.1/24, 10.10.31.1/24, 10.10.32.1/24 and 10.10.33.1/24 respectivly.  

Now the issues is when we try to ping the(non management) xx.1 interfaces, we get nothing, ""timed out"".  Initially we were looking at the routing protocol in the L3 switch because the switch could ping all interfaces and anything outside those networks could only ping the gateway on the switch.  So it looked like the switch wasn't routing.  

However we find that the routing works fine with other devices.  Just not any interface from the server on the additional networks.  We even installed the Dell version of ESXi 5.1 U1.  No dice.  

We are beginning to feel there is something we are missing that is different in 5.1+ than in 4.1+.  If you guys know of anything that would be great.  Google isn't turning back anything specific to my issues.

**TL;DR: Fresh ESXi 5.1.0 Update 1 Install(including Dell version for powerEdge). Additional networks(management works fine) added to the Host are not responding to network requests.  Switch will ping interface but no routing occurs with server interfaces.  Routing will occur however if new device is introduced to network with same IP.  Servers were taken out of proven and working ""duplicate"" ESXi 4.1 infrastructure.** 

Thanks for reading!

***EDIT: Switch is a physical Cisco C3750G (with ipservices).  It has 5 networked vLans.  Each has their own default Gateway.  One is for remote network(connection between switches).  One for physical machines(w/4 physical ports from server /Etherchanneled ).  One for NetApp FAS(w/4 physical ports into server /Etherchanneled).  One for vMotion (w/2 physical ports from server /Failover) and One for Management (2 physical ports from server /Failover).  All of the listed segments have their own vKernel with the listed above IPs.  Any devices placed on any of the vlans pings any of the others.  The only devices that do not respond to ping are any of the ports with the associated vKernel except for the management.  Placing say a laptop on the vlan with the vMotion network giving it the vMotion vKernel IP will ping.  Unplug it, plug the server back in, Time Out.*** 



***EDIT 2:  Also we are able to add datastores/FAS from the 10.10.32.x network.  So there is communication happening there.  Can ping the datastores but not the vKernel***



***EDIT 3: We didn't  get to installing VMs other than vCenter, vCloud, vShield.  The issue was first noticed after installing vCloud Director.  Director was unable to ""prepare"" hosts due to time out.  When we tried to ping the hosts that was when we discovered the only network we could ""reach"" was the management.***

***EDIT 4: Switch command ""show arp"" lists all of the vKernel IPs.  The switch sees them!***

I've been banging my head against the wall for nearly a week with RightFax and a few other app's though.  Right now, RightFax is my top priority app.  

In the base image we've baked the print drivers for it, rfprint.dll (the print processor), and an exe that the thinapp package looks for.  Now, the package looks like it's almost going to work: When you print to the RightFax printer, the fax menu pops up and lets you enter in your information, however when I hit next it fails to actually send the fax to the rightfax server.   The fax menu closes (Like it does on a working install), sends some packets to the server and then nothing.  It doesn't even log an entry on the server. 

I managed to get it to work for a short while the other day by registering a DLL (RFaxUI.dll) which I had copied to the same folder as the exe that app was looking for, but I haven't been able to recreate my success, which makes me wonder if I was just hallucinating from banging my head against the wall so much.  

Before anyone asks, I have successfully installed this on a copy of the image that's being used in view, and it works fine.  Unfortunately, it won't let me run any monitoring software like procmon to monitor what it's touching on the OS to help troubleshoot and figure out what it can't do in the thinapp.  I've tested the package on a Windows XP laptop I had, that I'd installed RightFax on so the printers had been created and it seemed to work just fine, so I'm thinking it's something to do with Win7 and RF.  

So, for the question, has anyone ever successfully packaged RightFax using ThinApp and gotten working? Or has the business asked for the impossible?

vSwitch0 is set up with physical adapters vmnic0 (first port on mobo) and vmnic4 (first port on pcie card).

VMkernel Port ""Management Network"" is connected to vSwitch0, with Active on vmnic0, and standby on vmnic4.

VMkernel Port ""vMotion"" is connected to vSwitch0, with Active on vmnic4, and standby on vmnic0.

They are connected to HP ProCurve 2510-48G switches.

A few days ago I got an error

I entered the host into Maintenance Mode to migrate off the VMs, and to do some troubleshooting. Checked the physical switch - everything seems fine, so I tried a reboot of the host. Nothing, vmnic4 still said disconnected.

Didn't do anything more about it until today when I was planning on digging more into it. However today vmnic4 says Connected and all good.

Any suggestions on what might cause the sudden ""Disconnect"" and sudden ""Connect"" again? Apprently nothing has changed. No reboots of switches or anything.

Could there be some ""temporarily disabled"" feature on the ProCurve switch for that port/mac-address or something? Didn't notice anything when I ran ""sh run"" a few days ago.

**TL;DR;** vmnic4 disconnected a few days ago, connected today. No configuration changes have been made. ""Temp ban"" on switch?

**Edit**: spesified that I checked the *physical* switch, so it wouldn't be confused with vswitch.

**Edit2**: after reboot, throubleshooting, and not finding any particular problems, I have changed the cables just to rule it out. Have been running flawless for now, however it ran flawless before the issue occurred too. *Thanks for all your input!* :-) I'll be back if it acts up again!

Truly.  I'm probably going to over-share, so I'd appreciate it if you'd give me some slack.

I am 38M, married with a 5 year old daughter, and live in suburban Long Island (NY).  As I mentioned, I already have my VCP5 (gained it on my own in March).  I'm very interested in focusing my career on VMware, as I am very passionate about it.

* My experience in **VMware** stems from multiple infrastructures I designed, implemented, and administer, so I feel that I am very knowledgeable.
* I have decent experience with **Cisco**, saw that as a weakness, and am currently working on obtaining my CCENT, followed by CCNA (my goal is to have CCNA by the end of summer).  I'm also trying to do some OJT by learning from other Cisco experts (I work for a VAR).
* I have worked within the **Windows** world for all of my career, from NT4 through 2012, and have very solid experience there.
* I'm familiar with EqualLogic **SANs**, and one of our clients has a Netapp, so I plan on familiarizing myself with Netapp's interface, as well.

Once I'm done with CCNA, I'm going to dive into vBrownbags, CBT Nuggets, et al and jump hardcore into VMware to keep climbing the certification ladder.

I'm at my wits end, and frustrated.  I don't know what else I can be doing, that I'm not already.  The only other thing I can think of (and have no evidence to support this) is that I'm extremely overweight (6'3"" 365lbs., but already on the path to losing) or perhaps I just interview poorly.  I don't get any negative feedback, so I can't be certain of any of it.  I feel like I'm a bright guy, critical thinker, and a great personality, and can certainly demonstrate that I'm a key part of any team if given the chance... but clearly something's not there from an employer's POV, as I never get that chance.

My issue is that while the phone rings, and I get e-mails, but they aren't for positions that allow me to hone my skills with VMware.  So, what am I missing?  What's some key gaps that are keeping me from getting into that key VMware career role?

I already got some ESXi Hosts as Guests up and running and everything works fine.

Now I want to deploy new hosts automatically:

The big problem is the ip configuration, because I only have static IP adresses available.

I already had a look into vApps with IPpools.
But as far as I unterstand it, there is no way for VM's without VMware Tools installed to get a IP from a IPpool without DHCP.

Another approach would be to perform a scripted install with the static IP settings. But the disadvantage would be the time consumption to set up a whole environment.  

Any ideas how i could create a template/setup for this scenario?

We also have a VMWare cluster (currently on ESX4) but it's small at the moment. Instead of expanding it, they decided to give this new company's software a shot. It's KVM based but the interface is pretty terrible and the company is not doing so hot right now, leaving us with little to no support. Needless to say, I'm done with them and I'd like to convert everything to VMWare. 


The infrastructure for this new platform was built entirely out of HP ProLiant DL180 G6 servers. Some have dual intel processors and are loaded with memory to serve as hosts, but a couple of them were used for storage too. Each storage machine is loaded with 2TB disks and a 10Gb NIC, then has software installed to create an NFS platform. My longterm goal is to use strictly centralized storage on a dedicated storage unit for our entire VMWare cluster, but right now these are all I have available to me. 


To make this question brief, am I headed for disaster? I was warned that performance from host-to-storage when storage is a ProLiant DL180 G6 will be awful compared to dedicated storage, even over a 10Gb network. Like I said, it's in my roadmap to move to dedicated storage as soon as I'm given the budget, but I'd like to stand my new cluster up on ESX 5.1 using these servers as my storage units until then.

It's hosting 6 guests, all running some flavor of Windows.  *One* of my guests, running Server 2003R2, completely shut down over the weekend.  I was able to bring it back up immediately with no apparent additional issues, and it's been stable for nearly 24 hours now.

The only out-of-place event log entry inside the guest is ""The previous system shutdown was unexpected.""  AFAICT, the server has no idea why it was shut down.

However, the ESXi event log does contain a single error event, which coincides with the guest's shutdown.  I believe the relevant part is here:

*** VMware ESX internal monitor error *** vcpu-3:VMM fault 14: src=MONITOR rip=0xfffffffffc2b90b7 regs=0xfffffffffc008d80

I am interested to find [this entry](http://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?language=en_US&amp;cmd=displayKC&amp;externalId=1021174) in the VMware KB.  It points to a possible hardware issue; in this case, possibly a failing CPU.  But is this really possible here?  The other 5 VMs were not affected in any way, and the ESXi host didn't crash.  It seems to me that a bad CPU would have symptoms aside from a single VM guest crashing.

Any insight would be welcome.  I'm still a newbie with VMware, and mysterious errors like this are pretty scary.  Doubly so given that this guest is our production Exchange machine.

Thanks in advance!

* Disks have to be thick provisioned
* Keys are known by us (service provider) and customer
** This could be mitigated by just having the customer perform the original setup, but we also perform maintenance/updates for customers, so there are some legit cases where both parties will need to know the key.

If you have the need to run several VLANs into a physical switch do you ever bother with multiple vSwitches each assigned to one or more pNICs, or do you simply go with one vSwitch with X number of pNICs trunked and have each portgroup on the vSwitch tag the traffic?

I'm guessing most of you do the latter, but the type of load balancing may dicate it?

At the beginning of February, I inherited a vSphere 4 environment (no 4.1.. ugh).  Last night, I discovered one of the production Linux VMs had been running in snapshot mode for about a year.  Last night, I use the vSphere Client to delete the snapshots.  As you can imagine, this took quite a long time.

Now, I have a ~500 GB folder for a 200 GB VM.  When checking the settings on the VM, the first HDD is labeled ""xxx000000003.vmdk"".  Browsing the data store shows 4 VMDKs for this disk.  The VM is running, all the files are up to date, and there are no snapshots listed on the VM in the VIC.

Two questions:

I am quite certain I chose to quiesce the filesystem.  Why are there still multiple VMDKs for this particular disk?

What is best practice for determining which, if any, VMDKs I can safely remove to recover space?

Guides suggest for the memory intensive apps such as SAP, SQL, Exchange etc that a reservation should remain.

2. If resource pools would help, do you define a resource pool by application type (eg all SAP servers in a single pool) or by memory usage amount (eg. all vm's with 16GB RAM in a single pool) and how should you size a pool in the first place?

3. For large resource-using app servers (e.g. SAP, Exchange,SQL) what amount or % of the vm's memory do you reserve (if any) in your production environments (and how much vCPU/Mem do you assign to these vms)? 

4. Does the recommendation re setting a reservation on Java-enabled app servers to the entire amount of configured memory of the vm still apply in vSphere 4.1 and 5.0?

1315617878.0,6,self.vmware,kap34,Storage Appliance Hell!,6,0,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/vmware/comments/kap34/storage_appliance_hell/,"Alright, so this has been an incredible journey for us, an annoying one at that mostly.

We're looking for a SAN, our requirements are quite low (~600 iops, 3TB usable space for the moment), but that is mostly because our SQL server is poorly configured (everything is cashed in memory, ugh).

We were told to look at a handful of models:

* Dell EqualLogic PS4000X:

This one is ok, but has a high price tag ($36k for us, filled with 10K SAS), expandability means dropping another $36k on a second one and setting up a storage grid (bleh).

* EMC VNX(e) 3100/3300/5300:

This one is nicer, even the 5300 comes in cheaper (~$31k), I love this storage setup (It's like a Solaris storage box, head unit + disk arrays), it's expandability is ""put as many or as few drives in the enclosures as you want, keep adding disks to pools"", you could practically let it slip that it runs Solaris and ZFS and I'd believe you with how much the behavior is similar. We were told to go with a 5300 for the additional scalability (EMC changed their mind over a 3300 after seeing my layout diagrams), it's only $2k more than they quoted a 3300 for us....

Alas EMC nickels and dimes us to death for software, on top of that _I can't service the bloody thing_, which makes me all kind of furious that I need to call someone in to install a failed drive or EMC wont support it.

* Dell EqualLogic 6100 series:

I was told to look at this due to the huge growing pains of the PS4000X, but... it still doesn't really grow, it's just big enough to last us awhile.



We have a few major projects in the works, including moving _ALL_ of our documents from old filing systems to digital, so we're looking at some heafty storage requirements in terms of scale.  I wanted to mix and match drive sizes (15k SAS for SQL, 10K SAS for Exchange, 7.2K NL-SAS for OS/ISO/DEV/TEST/Etc.), which you can't do with  any Dells...


I was also told today to look at StorTrends, produced by AMI (guys who make BIOS and MEGARAID firmware) due to their ability to scale like an EMC VNX model... Well we're on a deadline so being dropped hints here and there about similar systems is going to kill me and we're going to run out of time fast.

---

I'm continuously getting conflicting stories from sales (don't we always?), I hear that replication of iSCSI has more overhead than replication of NFS (TCP/IP traffic that is), another person says that isn't so (although I pointed out that iSCSI is going to have to replicate changes to blocks that manage the file system and could add additional overhead, but I couldn't see how that is a large enough amount to go with NFS over iSCSI for replication).

I'm told I can't mix and match disks in EMC, though EMC said they could (bleh, they have to certify their configs anyway so what they tell me it does they have to provide).

I'm told that _no one_ in their right mind does NFS mounts in production (although I'm a proponent of iSCSI, I kind of looked at the guy sideways over that one).

I was also told the disk enclosure model was ""the old way"" and for some vague reason worse than EqualLogic's grid setup....

Also - some tell me I have to buy 5.0, others say I can still buy 5.0 and downgrade to 4.1U1, which we'd rather do considering how much ""_older_"" hardware we have that may not work on 5.0 (reading a lot of hit and miss on the forums), and we don't want to drop our entire production network on a newly released product.

---

Finally, we need to do DR replication, we have a point-to-point, but I'd like to get rid of that and do a VPN tunnel over our WAN (save us some money, the point-to-point is never really used for low-latency stuff anyway). I'm assuming either way we may look into Veeam's SmartCDP because it seems the easiest and we can implement it on any SAN technology.

---

So, what do you guys run? Anyone run some of these? Your opinions? Anything out there you recommend with this disk enclosure/head unit setup that _isn't_ EMC? :)


---

Edit:

We're looking at about $47k for our two offices, DR only needs a fraction of the VMs (5) and hence the space, but still requires nearly 600 IOPS, we'll also need full on-site redundancy (so dual controllers, etc. etc.).

This place has never had a budget before, though the money does exist. My first order of business will be to get an HP Procurve (4204vl-48GS) switch.

They had absolutely no backup solution so I put a bunch of spare hard drives in one of the spare 2650s and put freenas on it and wrote scripts to backup data within the vms. Unfortunately right now over the 10/100 network, means it takes all day just to copy less than 15GB of data. 

Now despite all that, I think I can convince them to spend a little money.

All the current VMs combined are less than 200GB
We can have ZERO downtime on any of them (right now, is the scariest part of my job)
I want a storage solution that holds the VMs seperately
I also want to mount that storage system within the VM, and use it for storage
I want to have it back up different versions of the files (like microsoft's shadow copy)

After a call to VMWare we discovered that the Compellent plugin was trying to use what it saw was the next available SCSI ID of 0:7 to add the disk to the server. However, apparently in VMWare this ID, and all x:7 ID's are reserved. [If you try to add the disk in manually, 0:7 isn't in the list](http://www.tyrantanic.net/reddit/vmware/vmwarescsi.jpg) and it uses what is actually the next available id (in our case) of 0:10.

A stale LUN25 was being seen on vmware before attempting to add a new LUN25 which had a different hid, and the esx servers essentially fought over which was the correct one by issuing rescans of the datastores constantly. Just an FYI in case anyone else comes across something similar...We're using a Compellent SAN with 5 ESX4 hosts w/ dual port 4gb fiber cards each.
    
    
Working with Rachel from VMWare support we figured out the following...
    
    
This issue occurred because two situations existed:  
1. the value of LVM/EnableResignature was set to 1 on all hosts  
2. LUN 25 was seen with different LUN IDs on the ESX hosts in the cluster.
    
    
To resolve this issue, we disabled LVM/EnableResignature at the command line of the ESX hosts:  
        esxcfg-advcfg -s 0 /LVM/EnableResignature
    
    
We also corrected the presentation of LUN 25 by removing the LUN from presentation to the hosts, rescanning, verifying it's gone and then re-adding it again.
    
    
The situation we encountered is described in the following Knowledge Base article:

I probably should blog this somewhere, with screenshots, but here's the quick overview.

* Do a full system backup to somewhere on the network.
* Create a new VM with all the required specs
* Boot the VM from 2008 R2 DVD, select 'recover' and restore the system image from the network
* Recover to the VM

Everything above can be done using the [coldconvert.iso](http://www.google.com.au/search?q=VMware-ConverterCD-4.1.1-206170.zip), too. But it's quicker to do a backup and restore. VMware is just slow at moving vmdk's around.

Anyway, here's the tricky bit. Boot from this VM, and it'll BSOD. After it BSOD's, it'll come up with with recovery console, and fire up the command prompt.

Run regedit

Navigate to HKLM, and while you're there, file, load hive.

**THIS IS THE BIT THAT I KEEP STUFFING UP:** Pick the correct hive. It DEFAULTS to the recovery console's hive. This is NOT WHAT YOU WANT. Navigate to the REAL hive, which is probably going to be in **D**:\Windows\System32\Config\system

Call it something (zzz) and naviage to HKLM\zzz\ControlSet001\Services\LSI_SCSI .. Now if you DON'T see ControlSet002 then you haven't picked the right hive. The windows recovery hive only has ControlSet001. I spent a day swearing because I'd done this before, and it worked, and I couldn't do it again. Pick the correct hive.

Anyway, now you're in LSI_SCSI, you want to change the 'Start' DWORD from 3 to 0. If it's already at zero, YOU'RE IN THE WRONG HIVE. I keep harping on about this, because it's easy to pick the wrong hive, and if you're not paying attention, you will.

Oh, and that's only if you're picked 'Buslogic Parallel' as the SCSI adaptor type. If you've picked SAS, then change the LSI_SAS\Start dword to 0, instead.

Anyway, unload the hive, and reboot. Voila, the machine boots. Load the vmtools and you're done!

I did have to manually update the SVGA driver on one of the P2V'ed machines, but all the rest worked fine.

What I want to do is to copy the VMDK files to a NAS I've purchased, and then ship it over to our DR site and upload it to our SAN out there.  What I'm confused about/struggling with is a) copying the files over directly from one datastore to another, and b) verifying that I have all the right files copied over.

As for part a., I've tried using powerCLI to map both datastores as PS drives (the NAS supports NFS, so I've mounted it as such in vSphere), and then copying the files across.  But when I do it this way, the VMDK file ends up showing a file size of 0.  Is there a special command I need to use to get this to work, or would I be better off just dedicating a separate machine for this and dropping it to a mapped local drive instead?  The command I was trying was ""Copy-datastoreitem -recurse sourcedrive:\folder destdrive:\folder""

The most obvious approach would be to call Microsoft and ask them to let me reactivate it, but are they likely to agree? Or is there something else I can do?

My question is about vCenter server and keeping it resilient and able to provide dvS information to hosts once it boots up. Since our hosts' mgmt IPs are within the same access VLAN as the vCenter server, I'm just going to leave the management network as it is (non-trunked, local vSwitch-not distributed) and add a VM-access port group with no VLAN tagging.

I'm going to change the networking configuration of the vCenter server VM to the utilize the new port group I created on the set of management NICs instead of the new dvSwitches that the other VMs will use. This should hopefully allow the vCenter server to be powered on, see the hosts and make itself available on the LAN for me to access without the need for it to have vCenter services running to serve up via the distributed vSwitch.

If I make this change through vCenter (while it is live, obviously), will it work and switch over seamlessly? Is there a better way to go about this?

I can't imagine it's from GPO as this is prior to any windows authentication whatsoever. Where else should one look?
The server is gp-vc.domain1.com:443 and is populating as gp-vc.domain2.com:50000

edit: So I went ahead and deleted all of the entries for DNS _srv entries and DHCP options and rebooted the zero client, and now it's getting the default 192.168.1.1..  I guess that the zero client doesn't take these entries at face value.  I'll replace them one by one to find out which work as expected and which don't.

final edit: just in case someone runs across this with a similar deal: It ended up being dhcp options that were already in place in my environment.  It takes the hostname and combines with the domain name, which is why it came up with the proper prefix ""gp-vc"" with an incorrect suffix (domain2.com).  To ""fix"" it i just got rid of the hostname option from dhcp so that it disregarded dhcp options and set it up in my teradici profile and made sure that the dns srv was correct.  It's not instant unfortunately (dhcp IS) but after a few minutes it brings down the profile with all of it's customizations and hostname is correct.

So I'm still fairly new with our UCS and VMware and Vcenters but I have some of the basics down.

Apparently though I've forgotten something about adding blades to a UCS chassis and anything you're supposed to do beforehand with vcenter or the UCS manager.

I got a new b200 m3 setup and ready to plug in this morning and as soon as I loaded it, it booted up fine and started showing up in the manager no problem, but shortly after every one of my esx blades attached to my production cluster started to lose the ability to talk to it.  So my vcenter was freaking out.  I removed the new blade and everything cleared up.  I didn't get any alerts that my servers were down so I'm wondering if I ran into some sort of bug or glitch or hiccup.

I've got support tickets in with vmware and cisco but I was wondering if anyone else had run into anything similiar.

TL;DR  Added new blade to UCS caused vcenter to say it lost connection to my already installed blades.

**EDIT**  It appears as though it wasn't adding the new blade that caused the issue but that the UCS manager decided to restart the blade I had just finished with after I had removed it from maintenance mode.  If I had read the error I was getting in vcenter a little closer instead of panicking I would have seen it was just the HA agent complaining that they couldn't talk to one of the blades that had just come back up.

Ok so... small question, wasn't able to get a clear answer out of VMware so I thought I'd bring it here. I have discovered an old, unused vmware host in one of our offices and I'd like to get it up to the version that our production farm is on. 

One caveat, this office is 500km away from me. If I want to do it, it'll be through vcenter's upgrade manager. No problem, right? So I download the latest (5.0.0.0 U2) from vmware and run the baseline against the host, it says:

    Unsupported Devices Dell PERC4/DC RAID Controller found on the host

    Software modules:
    oem-vmware-esx-drivers-net-vxge 
    oem-vmware-esx-drivers-scsi-3w-9xxx
    published by third party vendor(s) are installed on the host.

    Upgrading the host will remove these modules

So I pondered and thought, maybe Dell has one with the drivers? Nope. Same issue.

So, am I basically going to knock out the network and scsi drivers if I perform this upgrade?

Even though its unused, its functional on 4.1., I don't have the ability to get out there any time soon and would rather not end up breaking it  remotely if possible.

I've been researching the move heavily as it's largely my project.  One thing I haven't found much discussion on is the topic of splitting or merging the vCenter application server and DB server.  Pretty much everything I've found says, ""depends on your environment.""  So, here's a bit about our environment.  What are your thoughts?

- 5 hosts

- ~250 VM's including ~70 servers, the rest being view desktops

- Future view expansion is likely

- Enterprise+ licensing for all hosts

- Guest OS licensing as well as SQL licensing is covered under our EA

- Guest OS will be Win2k8R2 w/MSSQL 2008R2

- All hosts and VM's in one physical site

- iSCSI storage to 4 Equallogic arrays

- We will be doing a fresh install of vCenter and moving our VM's to that via cold migration because we just bought new hosts.  

- The SSO, Inventory, and vCenter will be installed on the same server regardless of whether the DB is separate

- We will not be upgrading any hosts, just doing a fresh install of ESXi 5.1 and replacing the old hosts one by one

- vCenter and DB server (if separate) will be VM's

- There is no resource contention in our current environment and will not be in our new environment either.

Let me know if I'm missing any pertinent data.  We're a small enough environment that we could probably do just fine w/a combined install.  That's how we have it now in 4.1.  I'm not opposed to doing it either way.  I'm just curious if anyone has any thoughts one way or the other.  How are you doing it?

I have a lab environment configured with the following details:

1. An ESXi 5.0 host with 3 NICs - one NIC is assigned to management and other duties.  Two are assigned for iSCSI traffic on a different subnet to the management subnet.  All NICs are supported Intel models.
2. A Windows Storage Server box also with 3 NICs - one NIC is management and general traffic, the other two are on the same iSCSI subnet as the ESXi host.  The Storage Server is presenting a number of LUNs that the ESXi Host is using via iSCSI.
3. The switch being used is a Netgear GS716T.  The only deviation from normal network configuration I've made is to enable Jumbo Frame support on the iSCSI ports on the switch (as well as on both hosts).

We already have Veeam ONE implemented, and are on the fence about what vCOPS can do that Veeam ONE can't for our VDI environment.  I'm grasping at straws trying to learn what user usage reporting either of these two products offer.  Both are beasts with regards to what they can report against, so there will certainly be a learning curve involved on my end on that.

The other option that's on the drawing board is for me to script this all wrapped up in Powershell.  If this is the best way, what are folks' opinions on where to gather the user metrics re: usage?  Security event logs is one way I thought might work, but I also thought why not go straight to the Connection server's SQL database and pull the log on events from there.  The thing with that is, I believe either of those would have to run on the Connection server itself.  Or, can one get that info from a remote PoSH session?  I'm trying to keep all our reporting scheduled tasks on a centralized server for ease of management, and this seems like a workaround/dirty way to achieve that.

So, with all that being said, what are some thoughtsto control VM sprawl, specifically by monitoring user logon/logoff events in vSphere 5/View 5.1?

I have an IBM x3500 M3 server with a ServeRAID M5015 raid controller card (which I believe is a re-branded LSI MegaRAID 9260-8i RAID card). The server is currently running VMWare ESXi 5.0 Update 2 and attached to it we currently have 2 arrays attached to it: 

- 2x1TB in a RAID 1
- 5x900GB drives in a RAID5 which acts as VM data storage

What we are essentially trying to do is expand our RAID5 array to include more drives. I looked through the WebBIOS for options to expand the array (IE expand it by adding drives) and I wasn't able to find any options for doing so. I spoke with someone at IBM regarding this issue and they advised me to install the MegaRAID Storage Manager and attempt to add additional drive space through that tool. 

Unfortunately they did not provide adequate instructions to set this tool up. After some google searching I came across several instructions which detail how to get this working.  I've installed the LSI ESXi module on the server as well as the MSM software on my client machine as described here. When I scan for hosts I can see my ESXi host but the IP shows up as 0.0.0.0. Additionally when I try to log in I get an error message which says ""Unable to connect to CIMOM server"". 

Ideally we would like to add all five of our new 900GB drives to this new array at the same time. I understand that this process can take several days so if possible I'd like to expand the array while the server is running in order to avoid downtime. I know that you can do this with software RAID and I've been lead to believe that with the MSM tool and hardware RAID you can do this as well. It seems it's just a matter of getting MSM to connect with my RAID card at this point.

In one of our deployments, we're basically deviating from any VMware best practices.  

The Win7 VM isn't domain bound and has 3 **local** login accounts.  One IT admin account, one contractor admin account, and one standard user account for the operator (a bunch of non-IT centric facility engineers) that is shared.

For folks familiar with View Connection Servers &amp; the Teradici Management Console - here's my question.  If the standard user account gets disconnected from the PCoIP session, they aren't able to get back into the VM in the pool in question.  

So, they re-authenticate into the Connection Server through the initial Teradici login screen with their AD account credentials.  Selecting the (only) pool the AD user is entitled to (with only one VM in it) gives them ""All responding machines are currently in use"" until the standard local user account is logged off (by IT).

What pool settings will solve this?  Yesterday I decided to set ""Automatically logoff after disconnect"" to Immediately, but I'm also wondering if I need to enable ""Allow multiple sessions per user""

Is the View connection server aware when a PCoIP zero client session disconnects?  This VM is only used to monitor electrical usage by bringin up one program, so forcing the user logoff won't cause any data loss, there is none.

- Virtual hard drives are stored on secondary HDD (OS drive that VMWare is installed on is an SSD, 2nd drive is 1TB HDD installed using [OptiBay](http://www.mcetech.com/optibay/)). I use ParagonNTFS to enable write support to the NTFS drive.

Force Quit does not work, and graceful shutdown of my MBP does not work (it just hangs at the grey screen). I have to hold the power button to force a shutdown. After the reboot, I am able to launch VMWare again.

Activity monitor does not show VMWare using any more memory than I have allocated it (tried 1GB - 4GB). No matter how much I allocate, the same problem occurs. Also, there are zero page ins, page outs, or swap being used (per Activity Monitor).

I have tried using products like [FreeMemory Pro](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/freememory-pro/id486967844?mt=12) with little success. I say ""little"" because sometimes freeing the Inactive memory does prevent a crash, other times VMWare crashes while the memory is being freed.

I've installed the MEM, bound the ports, edited /etc/cim/dell/echmd.conf to allow 4 sessions and it's still not working right.

I can ping all 4 ports on the san from the esx, on the san I can see 4 sessions but they're all coming from either 1 or 2 ports on the esx.

In storage adapter properties it will show one or two paths as active and the others as not used.

Can anyone point me in the right direction?

I am a 13+ year IT veteran from the Windows landscape of enterprise and SMB products. I also have some older Metaframe experience and certs, but let me allude to where I mean to head...

I have taken all the freebie tests, read all the material I could, and have gone as far as test-driving proposals to potential customers who would reap the benefits from a Vmware solution. Unfortunately my employer is not willing to pony up $3k for the VCP, regardless. I see the value, and I was just wondering if ANY of you might have any suggestions on finding an alternative path to achieve my goal of getting VCP certified. I was told that Vmware occasionally gives deep discounts for this at their events, yet through all the calls and people I have spoken to at Vmware, I have yet to get a better ""quote"" than maybe $2700.00 .

I don't know much about vmware, I don't claim to. But When I look at [this](http://i.imgur.com/bqKjq.jpg), wouldn't that indicate that it's only using one single hard drive? 

I was working on another server, and the host ran out of space, so I went looking and found that the server's one and only vm was taking up all the space. When I checked the website and the .vmx config file, I saw no references to any other vmdk's. So I looked and sure enough there was what seemed to be a random stray vmdk. I deleted it, and noticed that it didn't free up space right away, I thought that was odd. I couldn't figure out why vmware needed it.

Well I went to turn the vm back on and now it's giving the hard drive missing error (won't let me power on the machine)

I'm in the process of recovering the file, but will someone **please tell me where vmware references its hard drives for a VM so I don't do this ever again. **

**update** I'm screwed. I've been working on this around the clock. I used photorec to look for the file and it found a 40GB file. I was excited. Then I found out that file was completely corrupt. I was depressed. I asked if there was **any** backup, he said there was, but it was old. Fortunately I was working with snapshots so I wasn't concerned with the date of the base disk. Well he came back with 3 DVDs labeled ""disk 1 of 4"" etc.. wouldn't you know it, disk #2 was missing. I don't have a clue how that happened, but that set me back. So last night I attempted to rebuild this basic server. I had backed up files before from within the server, but unfortunately they had an unstandard setup. It was a hosted web/email server. I don't know what to do. I am literally on the verge of a mental breakdown. I feel like puking. I keep getting text messages over and over asking me when it will be back and I keep telling them I have no idea. The stress is killing me.

I am in the process of upgrading an ESX 3.5 Farm to ESXi 4.1 and I wanted to share with you a major hurdle that I just ran in to.

I started with this company 3 weeks ago, first project was to do this upgrade and the previous sysadmins with knowledge of the vmware farm are gone. Story of my life :) The farm I am upgrading has 2 Test/Dev hosts, a NetApp 3020 with FC datastores. In production there are 6 hosts with a clustered NetApp 3240's and FC datastores. In my past life I used NFS precisely because I wanted to avoid FC, oh well :)

The Test/Dev upgrade went fine, after each hosts I ran through a test plan, and when both hosts were done I ran through a test plan for the dev cluster. Manager and I were happy so I started with production. For reasons beyond me our production cluster has 3 different CPU families. So ESX1&amp;2 are vmotion compatible, ESX3&amp;4 are, ESX 5&amp;6 are - I'm sure it made sense at the time =/

Anyway I start with ESX1 and everything is going pretty well when I notice in our alerts mailbox a message from the NetApp: FCP Partner Path Misconfigured - Host I/O access through a non-primary and non-optimal path was detected.

I am/was a pretty big FC newb so I called NetApp and they said ""Ya you don't want that to happen, but it was probably because the host turned on and scanned the LUNs, if you see any more errors definitely check it out"". I asked about the impact and they basically said it means that the ESX host is connecting via FC to filer2 and then filer2 is doing IO across its 1Gbps control link to filer1 which actually owns the LUNS for that datastore. So since I wasn't getting any more alerts I foolishly carried on my merry way.

Fast forward a few days, ESX2 is done and there are a bunch of VMs running on both. Lunch time on Friday comes around and Nagios starts throwing a tonne of alerts for a couple VMs, ESX1 and ESX2 and in walks a developer saying the team foundation server is offline. I check it out and things are a total mess, vmotion isn't worry for the VM in question and I can't shut it down either. Had to connect to the host and shut it off from there. Wrote it off as a one-off, cross my fingers and started looking at a few other issues. Later that evening the same thing happens, I was able to react faster, do some vmotions and things settled down once the busy VM quieted down. At this point I know it is something with my upgraded Hosts and take the weekend to think it over.

I come in Monday morning and decide to focus on this issue but before I can get settled the same server (team foundation) goes tits up. I freak out a little as at this point I am starting my 4th week :) So I call vMware and they take a look. Tech support guy was pretty awesome, takes a look at performance charts and says ""Hey you had a network spike at 9:20, your management and vm ports share the same 2 NICS, take a look at that"". But while he is looking around I notice all IO traffic is going on HBA3 and I remember the NetApp alert I got.

Over half the datastores on ESX1 and ESX2 were using secondary paths. Sure enough all of the affected VMs were in datastores connected via secondary paths! Curse you FC!

So tonight I am going to fix those up, could probably do it now but we have kind of a process to follow here. Post upgrade once all hosts are ESX 4.1 then I will take a look at implementing AULA as that is what VMware and NetApp both say we should do. 

Hopefully this is useful to someone planning to do an upgrade. Looks like the issue is because multi-path load balancing is not available in 3.5, or it could just be because of my FC newbness.

I read the best practices and plan on doing a Cold Clone using the converter boot CD. I have a few questions that I'm hoping some of you who have done this can help with.

1. I have the Cold Clone v 4.1. Does this work with ESXi 4.1 or only 4.0?
2. These are single DC networks. Are problems less likely with only one domain controller since it isn't syncing with anything else?
3. Assuming a successful cold clone, is virtualizing a DC all that difficult or is the process usually filled with problems?


A bit of extra information: Building up a fresh DC and demoting the physical DC isn't really an option since they are most likely running Exchange (and that isn't supported).

Ideally I'd like to just keep the existing 2003 DCs and then build up new 2008 DCs on the ESXi host box. Doing that simultaneously isn't going to happen right now either. So, I'm stuck virtualizing the existing DCs first and then creating new ones for 2008 server.


As I said, I've read the appropriate VMWare KB articles on virtualizing Domain Controllers, as well as VMWare Converter Best Practices. I'm just hoping for some real life information here and a solid answer to question 1 on the compatibility of Cold Clone 4.1 and ESXi 4.1.

Unfortunately, one of the parts we were missing was REMOVING the old snapshots that we didn't need.

So we ended up with our SQL Server 2008 machine with about 300gb worth of space used on the SAN with Snapshots. Which filled the SAN. And stopped the SQL server.

Whoops.

Anyway, I moved some things around, and the machine happily continued on, but I needed to remove those snapshots.  I tried it this morning, and it ran happily for about 1/2 an hour, and BLAM, disk full again.  F7U12 indeed.

I freed up some more space, clicked 'Retry' and it resumed... with the snapshot removal finished.  Hrm. That was suspiciously quick.

Having a look at the VM, it was still using the snapshot disk, and the snapshots were still there in the VMFS. They were there, but the snapshot manager didn't know of them.

I scratched my head for a while, and was starting to look into logging a call with VMware until I found a hint buried on the web that creating a new snapshot and removing it that will fix the missing ones.

And that's what happened.

As soon as I created a new snapshot, it appeared underneath a snapshot called 'Consolidation Helper'. I happily selected 'remove all', and it's been chugging away happily for a couple of hours now without a whinge.

A single ESXi 5 server with no vCenter and all VMs are stored on a local RAID5 drive consisting of 4 drives. ESXi is installed on local RAID1 drive with only 136GB of space. All 6 drive slots are in use.

It's running out of space, and unfortunately all disks are thick lazy zeroed taking up about 1.2 TB.

I need to rip out the 4 drives and replace them with bigger capacity.

I am trying to determine what is the fastest way to copy the existing data out of the existing local storage, replace drives, and copy it back to the new RAID6 I plan to create with the 4 new drives.

My idea so far is to shutdown servers, export them to OVF, replace storage, and import them back in. This should keep all settings, etc, correct?

Any better ideas?


**edit**: So I had 2 hours window and tried following:
Setup a new VM within environment, and connected a USB 2.0 hard drive to it. Then:

1. Used FastSCP. Transfer stopped progressing after few minutes.

2. Tried OVF export. Errored out after 25 minutes.

3. Tried browsing datastore from vSphere client and just downloading the files. It was going to take 60 hours for 150GB.


So, I think the conclusion is I must have a loaner server with enough space or this is no go, so that's what I'll be pushing for.

I still haven't successfully tried VM converter (it threw out error, seems like something left over from previous P2V conversion) and also will try Veeam backup.


**Edit2**

So I ended up doing super hack job. Added an ExpressCard USB 3.0 adapter to my laptop and used an external USB 3.0 drive. I was able to transfer 150GB using Veeam's FastSCP in under 24 minutes. Veeam backup took about 40 minutes, so it was actually faster to transfer the full thick disk even though Veeam benefits from being able to just read though the unused data on thick provisioned disk and compress it. I'll probably end up doing both to be on the safe side - they shouldn't take more than 10 hours total backing up.

Anyway, there is a NAS with data on it, I need to map about a dozen folders therein mapped as specifically lettered drives to the DOS VM.

I know one needs some sort of SMB package to get DOS to see a modern windows network.",,False,self,t5_2qnan,False,,,True,t3_1ged7j,http://www.reddit.com/r/vmware/comments/1ged7j/persistently_mount_several_mapped_network_drives/,
