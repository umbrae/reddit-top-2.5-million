Soon, though, security levels may be raised yet again to ""Irritated"" or even ""A Bit Cross."" The English have not been ""A Bit Cross"" since the blitz in 1940 when tea supplies nearly ran out. Terrorists have been re-categorized from ""Tiresome"" to ""A Bloody Nuisance."" The last time the British issued a ""Bloody Nuisance"" warning level was in 1588, when threatened by the Spanish Armada.

The Scots have raised their threat levelfrom ""Pissed Off"" to ""Let's get the Bastards."" They don't have any other levels. This is the reason they have been used on the front line of the British army for the last 300 years.

The French government announced yesterday that it has raised its terror alert level from ""Run"" to ""Hide."" The only two higher levels in France are ""Collaborate"" and ""Surrender."" The rise was precipitated by a recent fire that destroyed France's white flag factory, effectively paralyzing the country's military capability.

Italy has increased the alert level from ""Shout Loudly and Excitedly"" to ""Elaborate Military Posturing."" Two more levels remain: ""Ineffective Combat Operations"" and ""Change Sides.""

The Germans have increased their alert state from ""Disdainful Arrogance"" to ""Dress in Uniform and Sing Marching Songs."" They also have two higher levels: ""Invade a Neighbor"" and ""Lose.""

Belgians, on the other hand, are all on holiday as usual; the only threat they are worried about is NATO pulling out of Brussels .

The Spanish are all excited to see their new submarines ready to deploy. These beautifully designed subs have glassbottoms so the new Spanish navy can get a really good look at the old Spanish navy.

His clients were charged, as was usual, with being accessory to the devil. Under the common law there could be no accessory unless there was also a principal; and no accessory could be convicted until the principal was convicted; for if the principal be acquitted there is no guilty principal and hence can be no accesory. Consequently until the principal be convicted the accessory cannot be tried.

Taking advantage of this state of the law, Filmer argued that his clients could not be tried until their alleged principal had been tried and convicted, and how could this be done? Only according to the law of the land. In the first place how could the devil be summoned? The officer serving the precept would either be obliged to go to the devil and summons him personally, or, failing that, would be obliged to leave a copy of the precept at his usual place of abode. Although admiring friends of the officer may from time to time have advised him to do both, yet the practical application of such advice is an impossibility. Then assuming the respondent to be duly summoned, he would be entitled to a trial by a jury of his peers. But His Satanic Majesty has no peers, and even if he had, they would be certain to be in collusion with the respondent and would certainly acquit him. Under any circumstances therefore how could his accessories be tried? 

– H.C. Shurtleff, “The Grotesque in Law,” American Law Review, January-February 1920

My motor coach was usually just a way of driving around senior citizens until they passed out in the back. Occasionally they would either shit their pants or wake up and ask where the bears were, but I digress.

On one such tour I was driving a route which ran from Skagway, Alaska up to Caribou Crossing, Yukon. I picked up a group of pre-zombies (over fed senior citizens who frequently shuffle into the street.) from the train and began driving them back to Skagway so they could get back on their cruise. Which is normally a very pleasant experience, except this was a cruise for born again Christians. For reasons which I think are obvious, they had issues when I was describing how glaciers formed the valley 16,000 years ago... So, I was off to a rough start.
On the way back I was giving a tour when suddenly my wind shield exploded in red. I slammed on the brakes and shouted ""FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUdge...."" into my mic. Imagine, if you will, that this expletive ended in a high pitched whistle. Screaming profanity at a group of born agains is usually a good way to get fired. So, I was naturally a little nervous.

I climbed out of the coach to figure out what I had hit. There, beneath the splatter on the windshield was the head of a salmon lodged in the bumper. The pre-zombies began to shuffle towards the smell of fresh blood and given their propensity for wandering into traffic I couldn't have them climbing out of the coach.
I climbed back in the coach, shut the door and radioed down to dispatch. It is policy to report any collision, and given that I had screamed the F-word at 40 aging Christians; I was pretty sure I was on thin ice as it was.
Through the static, we were still quite a ways away from Skagway, I heard dispatch respond to my call. I reported the collision and they asked what I had collided with. I clearly reported that I had hit a fish. There was a pause and the dispatcher came back on and asked ""What did you hit? It sounded like you said fish."" I replied, ""I hit a fish."" There was a long pause and dispatch came back on. ""Did you drive into the lake?""

I told them no, and that I was parked on the side of the Klondike highway. There was another pause and then the head mechanic got on the radio. ""There is no way what we are hearing is what you are saying, sit tight. I'll be up in a minute.""

So, I sat on the side of the road for twenty minutes waiting for the mechanic to come up and give me the all clear to keep driving. The Klondike Highway is easily one of the most beautiful stretches of road in the world and I would have loved to just sit and take in the scenery. However, in this situation I had the pastor for the born agains in my face explaining how the earth was exactly 6000 years old and that I had been mislead by agents of Satan. I always called them University professors, but I guess I had been mislead about that as well.
When you are attacked by a bear, the best defense is to play dead. Curl up in the fetal position and wait for it to go away. This is also the only defense from born again Christians. Finally, what felt like 6000 years passed and the mechanic showed up. Climbed out of his truck, took a long drag on his cigar and shouted ""Well fuck me sideways, you hit a flying fucking fish!""

The pastor soon descended on the poor mechanic followed by a women in her 50s brandishing her pocket bible like a battle axe. I took a step back, leaned against the coach and chuckled. It's funny when it happens to somebody else.

If you were wondering how I hit the fish, it was supposed to be a bald eagles lunch. It grabbed a salmon that was a little too big for it, lost its grip and I had the unbelievable luck of hitting it on its way to the ground. Fun story for me, shitty day for the salmon.

In addition to being useful, some of the tweets they put out are really funny, and in a recent social media event, the following [tweet](https://twitter.com/oslopolitiops/status/289840348237283328) was awarded ""Tweet of the year"":  

&gt;We were informed about an ongoing disturbance with screaming women. When we arrived we found a party for nurses. We'll be leaving the scene soon.  

Some other good ones from the Oslo police:  
1)  

&gt;We've received complaints about a street musician who plays only one song. Has been going on for months, the police requests a broader repertoire.  

2)  
  
&gt;A person was waving a machete around by the railway station. The police were quickly at the scene to arrest the man. This is not the intended use of machetes.  

  3)
&gt;[Local pond]: no drowning. A woman had been bathing without clothes, her husband arrived with a towel, and they walked home wearing only that. The lady was very embarrassed.  

4)  
&gt;The moose has now left the address and is likely back in the forest with his friends  

5)  

&gt;Police arrived at the scene of a reported domestic disturbance. Someone had been talking ill about mother-in-law. The peace has been reestablished.  

6)  

&gt;We've received no more messages about the poodle. Let's hope it's ""permanent"" and that it's found its way back home.  

7)  

&gt;While we're working on these important tasks, someone has reported three escaped horses by Gaustad. If you find them, catch them and call us. Thanks!  

8)  

&gt;A patrol just arrived at Gaustad, but they've forgotten their lasso so they can't catch the horses. Standing by and observing.

I would like to share a personal experience with my friends about drinking and driving........
As you well know, some of us have had brushes with the authorities on our way home from an occasional social session over the years.

A couple of nights ago, I was out for an evening with friends and had a couple of cocktails and some rather nice red wine.

Knowing full well I may have been slightly over the limit, I did something I've never done before ~ I took a cab home.
Sure enough, I passed a police road block but, since it was a cab, they waved it past.
I arrived home safely without incident, which was a real surprise; as I have never driven a cab before and am not sure where I got it or what to do with it now that it's in my garage.

Happy Holidays!

Time to leave all your Boston problems at home and go visit your Chicago problems! They’ve been stewing, unresolved, for six or seven months, so it’s about time you said hello.

Hello, crazy ex-girlfriend from high school who I didn’t know was working at this specific coffee shop around the corner from my parents’ house! Oh, you named your first son after me? And that’s his name and face tattooed on your right boob? Yes, I agree: it’s very clever how the tattoo artist made one of his eyes a nipple. Why yes, my middle name is Michael--I look forward to seeing that on your left boob in--oh, one month? Wow, fantastic! I thought that was just a weird fanny pack!

Hello, weird ancient neighbor who hands out raisins instead of candy every year at Halloween! Nope, it is 2012, not 1998. No, you can not call the Korean family across the street that.

Hello, beloved pet from my childhood! Please, please, please don’t die. I have lived a charmed life and I’m not ready to experience real loss yet, let alone pet loss, which as you and I both know is five times worse than real loss. At least not until I’m 29.

Hello, gorgeous girl I’ve had a crush on since middle school and whose hips and scent I still dream about, having danced with you briefly at sophomore homecoming! Why no, I had no idea you always used to go running down this street every morning at 7. Interesting that you decided to pick up that habit again, now that you’re home visiting your folks. I bet the guy who correctly predicted that turn of events is pretty smart and handsome and not a creep! I bet he would be a good provider and you would like to move halfway across the country to be with him!

Hello, mom! Please don’t be a hoarder. Please don’t be racist. Please don’t divorce my dad. Please don’t have a prescription drug addiction. Please don’t--okay, yes, I will explain facebook to you.

Hello, old video games! Oh, I see what you’re doing--you’re going to do that thing where you entice me into playing with you and then I’m going to feel ashamed for having playing with you instead of reading that Robert Caro LBJ biography I’ve been telling everyone I’m reading! And then next week, I’m going to tell everyone that I spent a relaxing weekend at home, reading, when in fact I re-memorized the Pokerap? Well, let me have a drink first.

Hello, dad! Oh, you voted for Mitt Romney and you’d like to tell me all about Paul Ryan’s tax plan and how my generation is lazy and that’s why we can’t get jobs but not me specifically, because I worked hard and went to a good college and something better will turn up, especially as soon as Obama is out of the White House? Sounds great!

The Almost Perfect Life 

My life’s ninety percent great  
 But something’s not quite right  
 Like an ocean without waves  
 Or a moon without a night  
 Or a shoe without a sock  
 Or an empty mailbox  
 My life is almost perfect  
 But it’s not.   
  
My life’s ninety percent perfect  
 Like a grey day at the beach  
 Or a wide-spread climbing tree  
 With the first branch out of reach  
 Like a door with 3 knobs  
 Or a boy named Bobby-Bob  
 My life is almost perfect  
 But it’s not. 
  
My life could be so perfect  
 One-hundred percent the best  
 Like a double chocolate sundae  
 Or an A+ on a test  
 Like swimming in a pool  
 In the summer with no school  
 My life could be so perfect  
 But it’s not. 
  
My life would be so perfect  
 And now I’ll tell you why  
 It’s enough to make me grumpy  
 Not enough to make me cry  
 But my life would be so perfect  
 Like a soda with double sugar  
 The best life in the world  
 If I could only pick this booger.

After several months, Lola complained that she had never climaxed during sex; and according to her Grand Momma, all Cajun women are entitled to a climax once in a while.
So, to resolve the problem, they went to see the large-animal Vet since there was no trustworthy doctor anywhere in Pierre Part.The Vet didn't have a clue, but he did recall how, during the hot summer, his Momma and Daddy would fan a cow with a big towel that was having any difficulty breeding. This would cool her down and make her relax.

So, the Vet told them to hire a strong, virile, young man to wave a big towel over them while they were having sex. This, the Vet said, would cause the young wife to cool down, relax, and then climax.

So the couple hired a strong young man from the big city of Houma to wave that big towel over them as the Vet suggested.

After many efforts, Lola still had not climaxed! They went back to the Vet. The Vet said for Lola to change partners and let the young man have sex with her while Boudreaux waved the big towel.

They tried it that night and Lola went into wild, screaming, ear-splitting climaxes, one right after the other for about two and a half hours.
When it was over, Boudreaux looked down at the exhausted young man and in a cocky manner said, '*And dat, my friend, is how you wave a towel*'",,True,,t5_2qh34,False,,,True,t3_ijsxq,http://www.reddit.com/r/humor/comments/ijsxq/boudreaux_joke_nsfw/,

We went behind the village tavern where you leaned against the back fence and I made love to you.'


'Yes', she says, 'I remember it well.'


'OK,' he says, 'How about taking a stroll around there again and we can do it for old time's sake?'


'Oh Jim, you old devil, that sounds like a crazy, but good idea!'


A police officer sitting in the next booth heard their conversation and, having a chuckle to himself, he thinks to himself, I've got to see these two old-timers having sex against a fence. I'll just keep an eye on them so there's no trouble. So he follows them.



The elderly couple walks haltingly along, leaning on each other for support aided by walking sticks.. Finally, they get to the back of the tavern and make their way to the fence. The old lady lifts her skirt and the old man drops his trousers. As she leans against the fence, the old man moves in.


Then suddenly they erupt into the most furious sex that the policeman has ever seen. This goes on for about ten minutes while both are making loud noises and moaning and screaming. Finally, they both collapse, panting on the ground.


The policeman is amazed. He thinks he has learned something about life and old age that he didn't know.

After about half an hour of lying on the ground recovering, the old couple struggle to their feet and put their clothes back on. The policeman, is still watching and thinks to himself, this is truly amazing, I've got to ask them what their secret is..

So, as the couple passes, he says to them, 'Excuse me, but that was something else. You must've had a fantastic sex life together. Is there some sort of secret to this?'


Shaking, the old man is barely able to reply, 'Fifty years ago that wasn't an electric fence.'",,False,,t5_2qh34,False,,,True,t3_e4bsj,http://www.reddit.com/r/humor/comments/e4bsj/do_you_remember_the_first_time_we_had_sex/,

The man says, ""A hamburger, fries and a beer,"" and turns to the ostrich, ""What's yours?""

""I'll have the same,"" says the ostrich.

A short time later the waitress returns with the order.

""That will be $9.40 please."" The man reaches into his pocket and pulls out the exact change for payment.

The next day, the man and the ostrich come again and the man says, ""A hamburger, fries and a beer.""

The ostrich says, ""I'll have the same.""

Again the man reaches into his pocket and pays with exact change. This becomes routine until the two enter again.

""The usual?"", asks the waitress?

""No, this is Friday night, so I will have a steak, baked potato and a salad,"" says the man.

""Same,"" says the ostrich.
 
Shortly the waitress brings the order and says, ""That will be $32.62.""

Once again the man pulls the exact change out of his pocket and places it on the table. The waitress cannot hold back her curiosity any longer.

""Excuse me, sir. How do you manage to always come up with the exact change in your pocket every time?""

""Well,"" says the man, ""several years ago I was cleaning the attic and
found an old lamp. When I rubbed it, a Genie appeared and offered me two wishes. My first wish was that if I ever had to pay for anything, I would just put my hand in my pocket and the right amount of money would always be there.""

""That's brilliant!"" says the waitress. ""Most people would ask for a million dollars or something, but you'll always be as rich as you want for as long as you live!""

""That's right…Whether it's a gallon of milk or a Rolls Royce, the exact money is always there,"" says the man.

The waitress asks, ""What's with the ostrich?""

-------------------------------------------------------------------

I used to work in a dockside bar that was, to put it mildly, *a little rough*.

It all began after I moved to this well-known (and utterly crap) port town. The town itself was bad enough, rammed full of ne'er-do-wells and a smorgasbord of freaks, but the closer you got to the port the worse the punters became. The vile clientele that poured through our doors was continuously topped-up thanks to the convenient location of the bar. It was the first watering hole the transients clattered into as they stepped off their ships onto terra firma. Some of our customers wouldn't have looked out of place in a zoo and a couple still make me shudder when I remember how nauseating they were.

The bar itself was a monumental shithole. The drab interior got wrecked most weeks by the locals fighting with the fleeting (then fleeing) masses. The owner had tried to add a pointless touch of sparkle by hosting live acoustic jazz bands most nights, but the contrast between the music and the atmosphere was laughable. Imagine a clarinet concerto in the aftermath of the Brixton riots and you'll be halfway there. My job as chief barman was without question the worst means of paying my rent I've ever had.

I'd only been working there for six months but I'd just about had enough, what with having to blindly ignore the constant criminal activity and put up with the ebb and flow of human detritus that wafted through. I’d developed a bit of a cunt's attitude to my customers, as it was the only way to get through the nights. The final straw came on a particularly busy shift. To give you some idea of the kind of bullshit I had to put up with, earlier in the day I'd endured a full sweep of the place by the authorities to assist them with a fucking manhunt. It was definitely not shaping up to be a good evening. I was serving a particularly short-fused customer with the motley jazz band in full swing when the door swung open. I knew at once we were due for big trouble.

It was a group of four drifters who looked *completely* out of place; that is, they looked relatively normal compared to our usual patrons. The first problem was that two of the members of this group were obviously flaming homosexuals and this was *not* a gay-friendly bar. The taller chap was a sight to behold. He was worryingly camp, wearing a lurid gold outfit that Liberace himself would have sent back to the shop for being too ostentatious. The short, fat one was relatively straight-acting but I’d already made my mind up. This feckless bling-clad mincer and his stumpy companion were attracting exactly the wrong kind of attention from the burly crowd assembled in front of the bar. I had to do something quickly, so I made it clear that I wouldn’t be serving either of them. The young bloke in the group had a quick word and thankfully, the sad-faced queers retreated rapidly towards the exit in order to avoid what otherwise would've ended with a merciless beating. I felt bad, but it was better than clearing up their body parts.

The other two gentlemen stayed in the bar. The old fellow wandered over to one of our regulars and started chatting, which was a little strange as I knew the guy couldn’t speak English at all. It seemed that they were acquaintances though, so I turned away from the bar for a moment to collect my thoughts. Almost as soon as I’d turned around, I felt a tug at my shirt. It was the young guy again. He gave me an understanding nod but didn’t actually say anything. I still felt rather grateful and relieved for his swift help a few moments earlier, so I handed over a free drink which he silently accepted.

Barely ten seconds later, it all kicked off. One of the foreign dockhands in the bar spotted my act of charity for this stranger and took exception to his special treatment. I turned to see this fearsomely-ugly thug march over to shove him hard and begin a drooling tirade of unintelligible drunken aggression. One of the dockhand’s mates joined in with the intimidation tactics. They were both very drunk, but I overheard him slur something about a criminal record followed by a death threat. That was par for the course in this place. The young stranger kept cool, but the altercation had obviously unnerved the poor chap. Before he’d had a chance to think about retaliation, his elderly friend had left the chit-chat with my regular customer and stepped into the situation himself.

The old man tried his best to calm things down, but by now it was too far gone and a fight was ready to break out. Without any further warning, the dockhand’s mate grabbed the younger guy and flung him across the room into a table full of drinks. I spotted a gun being produced so I ducked behind the bar, where I then heard a terrifying scream. The commotion died down and I re-emerged to find the assailant lying on the ground, one arm completely severed and the old man standing there wielding a glowing energy sword. I watched blankly as he returned it to his belt, my customers continued with their business and the band continued playing their god-awful music as if nothing had even happened.

Like I said, it was a fucking shithole.

1314826724.0,455,self.humor,k0mm6,My Dad burned me a CD - A Son Analyzes the awkward song selection,840,385,124,http://www.reddit.com/r/humor/comments/k0mm6/my_dad_burned_me_a_cd_a_son_analyzes_the_awkward/,"To start, I think my dad is a great guy and I have a good relationship with him, but drug use all of his life screwed with his head a little bit and left him a bit boisterous and eccentric. He is an over the top ‘New Yorker’ who once worked as a radio DJ when he was younger. He never used the internet until about 2-3 years ago, and only recently learned about downloading songs and burning CDs. Yesterday while cleaning out my car I stumbled upon a CD that my Dad burned for me a few months ago. When I went to play it, I stumbled upon the most incredibly confusing and hilarious mix CD ever... and wanted to share with you my analysis on why he selected each song for me, track by track.

To begin, the CD is titled (with black sharpie marker) ** “Me &amp; My Posse”. ** I don’t think he means that these are literally his friends, but that maybe these are the songs he and his ‘homeboys’ might listen to is they were hanging out in a project building stairwell when he was younger...

**Track 1. All My Life - KC &amp; JoJo.** My dad wanted to start me off easy on this CD, relaxing my mind and emotions with this soulful ballad. My dad always reminds me that I am his best friend in life, so this may be a subliminal message from him to me that he loves me (or his posse). I’ve never been a huge fan of this song, and I don’t think my dad takes me as a huge KC &amp; JoJo fan- but I did grow up in the 90’s so maybe he thought it’d work.

**Track 2. All For Love - Color Me Bad.** Now the party is starting! My dad has loved this song from the moment it came out years ago, and I vividly remember me and him singing this song together. As a kid I remember shouting lyrics like “I want to take care of you girl, i’ll serve you well!” with my hands raised to the sky as if i were praising Jesus. Now, as an adult, this song is embarrassing to listen to. I know we complain about bad music today, but I can’t imagine this being acceptable during any musical period over the last several decades. Regardless, my dad will never let this song go- and it needed to go on the CD.

**Track 3. Return Of The Mack - Mark Morrison.** This is hands down my dads favorite song of all time. From the moment that first thump of bass kicks in my dad becomes a different person- he is one stage and performing for anybody in the room, literally. If you’ve never heard this song, it is some hybrid funk/hip-hop dance anthem with hilarious voice cuts between lyrics ala “Hustlin’ stones all night long”. No matter what CD my dad is burning, there will never be a burned CD without this track on it. Never.

**Track 4. I’ll Make Love To You - Boys II Men.** While ‘Return of the Mack’ may be my dads favorite individual song, his favorite group is Boys II Men. I think in another life my dad was in a R&amp;B group of some sort, and he will remind you quite often how outstanding these songs are. I can admit that up until this point, this is actually the first good song my dad has put on the CD- but mind you I said my dad used to be a radio DJ, so he doesn’t want to put his audience to sleep with this stuff... he is about to take off into a whole other universe on the next track.

**Track 5. California Love - Dr. Dre &amp; 2Pac.** At this point my dad may have realized he was pushing it with all the ‘lovey dovy’ songs and needed to ‘man-up’ this CD a bit if he were to present it to his son (and have the chance to still label it ‘Me &amp; My Posse’). A for sure party hit, my dad is showing his west coast love by remembering the late great 2Pac.

**Track 6. Juicy - Notorious B.I.G..** My dad is a man of fairness and balance. So, i’ve come to the conclusion that he added this song simply for the sake of showing love to a great dead east coast rapper. If you show respect on a burned CD to the greatest dead west coast rapper, you absolutely have to show respect to the greatest dead east coast rapper. Also, they must be played back to back on the CD- so you don’t get confused.

**Track 7. Down On Bended Knees - Boys II Men.** Again, my dad has a fascination with mid 90’s love songs. And again, a song I remember him having us sing with him as a child. In case all that crazy rap music we just enjoyed was a little too intense for us, he needs to sooth the listeners minds again by playing this classic tear jerker.

**Track 8. Crossroads - Bone Thugs &amp; Harmony.** At this point I can tell my dad is starting to get really confused. He probably still has that “bomb beat from Dre” California Love still in his head, but he doesn’t want to go overboard with the rap music. But wait, what if his ‘posse’ is enjoying the rap music? But wait, what if they’re enjoying the slow songs? Don’t worry about it- we’ve got the perfect track for that. Thugs AND Harmony? Well hell yes he’ll put this classic jam down... sure to please all parties.

**Track 9. Candy Rain - Soul For Real.** Well i’ll be damned if it’s not a party up on this CD again! Forget deciding between love songs and rap songs- let’s play a track that everyone can dance too. Knowing my dad, I’m assuming he started getting really excited with his song selections so far, and reached way back into his ‘gay 90’s music’ database to pull out this gem.

**Track 10. Life Is Too Short - Too $hort.** My dad has to be thinking, “Wait, wait- stop! That last song was too gay! How do I delete it of the playlist? WTF?” He couldn’t figure out how to take the song off the playlist, and the only logical thing to do next was to put the most gangster rap song he could find. Too $hort is a Bay Area hometown hero, but I’ve never been a big fan. If he was making this CD specifically for me, he went way out of my musical range on this one- but if it’s for the CD listening audience as a whole (who I assume he had in mind) then he definitely won them back after Candy Rain.

**Track 11. I Swear - All 4 One. **With limited CD burn space left, my dad doesn’t want to let a few of his favorite love songs fall off. He knows that playing this song right after Too $hort is a risky move, but something in his body that he cannot control forces him to put this song on the list. He needs to focus, settle into where this CD is taking him, and make the best decisions he can with the last few tracks...

**Track 12. As Long As You Love Me - Backstreet Boys.** AHHhhh shit what the fuck just happened... Miss! Miss! Abort! Abort! There has never been a time in my life where I have expressed any interest in the Backstreet Boys to my father. A young boy growing up in the 90’s, I’ve only ever had dislike for them. Perhaps my dad thinks that one day i’ll be playing this CD in my car while my sister is riding along with me, and she’ll enjoy it? Maybe he forgot he was making this CD for me, and thought he actually was making it for my sister?

**Track 13. This I Promise You - N’Sync.** Again, strictly in the name of being fair and balanced my dad has to put this song on the CD now. In the same fashion as 2Pac/Notorious BIG being played back to back- You can’t play one of the most popular boy bands ever without playing the other most popular boy bands ever. At this point my dad clearly realizes this CD has gone soft- As much effort as he has put in so far to craft the perfect mixtape, there is simply too many love songs. And again, to balance out the CD completely, he needs to hit a homerun with his last song selection.

**Track 14. Self Destruction - Public Enemy.** WHATTT THEEE FFFFFFF!!! Mind you, i’m a white guy who lives in the suburbs- My dad could not have picked a better song to end this CD with and completely skew and shift the balance of this mixtape. This power-to-the-people staple single handedly blows every other track on this CD out of the water... My dad had go big or go home if he was going to complete the perfect burned CD, and he did. This last track selection left me speechless.

So there you have it, a little glimpse into the CD burning genius of my father. Not sure if it’s the best, the worst, of the best worst CD compilation of all time. This CD was not burned so bad on purpose (with the likes of ‘Mambo #5’ or ‘How Bizarre’) this was a genuine CD made to enjoy. I hope you lol’d. Also, AMA.

**The mistress**

A husband and wife were having dinner at a very fine restaurant when this absolutely stunning young woman comes over to their table, gives the husband a big kiss, says she’ll see him later and walks away.

His wife glares at him and says, “Who the hell was that?”

“Oh,” replies the husband, “she’s my mistress.”

“Well, that’s the last straw,” says the wife. “I’ve had enough, I want a divorce.”

“I can understand that,” replies her husband, “but remember, if we get a divorce it means that you don’t get any more shopping trips to Paris, no more wintering in Barbados, no more summers in Tuscany, no more Ferraris and Lexus’s in the garage and no more yacht club. But the decision is yours.”

Just then, a mutual friend enters the restaurant with a gorgeous babe on his arm.

“Who’s that woman with Jim?” asks the wife.

“That’s his mistress,” says her husband.

So a bus filled with Catholic schoolgirls skids right in front of an oncoming train, and they all die instantly.

Their souls go up to heaven, and St. Peter makes them get in line so he can let them in one-by-one.

St. Peter: ""I'm going to ask each one of you a question: if you tell the truth, I'll let you in through these Pearly Gates. If not, you're going to **hell.**

So he asks the first girl: ""Have you ever... ***seen** a penis?*
She freaks out, and doesn't know what to do and decides she NEEDS to go to heaven and respons ""yes, sir. When I was 12, I once saw a penis"".
St Peter: ""you naughty girl, go wash your eyes our with holy water!"" So she does and he lets her in.

He asks the second girl, ""Have you ever... ***touched** a penis?*"" This girl too, freaks out, and decides to come clean. ""Yes sir, once when I was 15, I touched a boy's penis..""
St Peter: ""You slut! go wash your hands with holy water!"" She does and he lets her in. The bowl of holy water is getting a little muddy now.


Suddenly a fight breaks out somewhere towards the back of the line. St. Peters goes over there to see what all the ruckus is about. ""What's going on here?""

""Mr. St. Peter sir, you have to let me go next!""

""And why should I let you go now, when that young lady up front is rightfully next?""

""Because, you have to let me gargle with that water before she sticks her ass in it!!""


**TL;DR**: catholic schoolgirls ~~are slutty~~, it went *okay*. &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;

EDIT: There's nothing that can be done about the NSFW tag at this point. When posting, I figured a dirty joke is a dirty joke, and chances are it's unacceptable for a corporate environment. Sorry to disappoint anyone looking for porn.

New Direction for any war:
Send Service Vets over 60!

I am over 60 and the Armed Forces thinks I'm too old to track down
terrorists. You can't be older than 42 to join the military. They've got the
whole thing ass-backwards. Instead of sending 18-year olds off to fight,
they ought to take us old guys. You shouldn't be able to join a military
unit until you're at least 55.

For starters, researchers say 18-year-olds think about sex every 10 seconds.
Old guys only think about sex a couple of times a day, leaving us more than
28,000 additional seconds per day to concentrate on the enemy.

Young guys haven't lived long enough to be cranky, and a cranky soldier is a
dangerous soldier. 'My back hurts! I can't sleep, I'm tired and hungry.' We
are impatient and maybe letting us kill some asshole that desperately
deserves it will make us feel better and shut us up for awhile.

An 18-year-old doesn't even like to get up before 10am. Old guys always get
up early to pee, so what the hell. Besides, like I said, I'm tired and can't
sleep and since I'm already up, I may as well be up killing some fanatical
son-of-a-bitch. 

 If captured we couldn't spill the beans because we'd forget where we put
them. In fact, name, rank and serial number would be a real brainteaser.

Boot camp would be easier for old guys. We're used to getting screamed and
yelled at and we're used to soft food. We've also developed an appreciation
for guns. We've been using them for years as an excuse to get out of the
house, away from the screaming and yelling. 

They could lighten up on the obstacle course however. I've been in combat
and never saw a single 20-foot wall with rope hanging over the side, nor did
I ever do any pushups after completing basic training.

Actually, the running part is kind of a waste of energy, too. I've never
seen anyone outrun a bullet.

An 18-year-old has the whole world ahead of him. He's still learning to
shave, to start a conversation with a pretty girl. He still hasn't figured
out that a baseball cap has a brim to shade his eyes, not the back of his
head.

These are all great reasons to keep our kids at home to learn a little more
about life before sending them off into harm's way.

Let us old guys track down those dirty rotten coward terrorists. The last
thing an enemy would want to see is a couple million pissed off old farts
with attitudes and automatic weapons.",,False,,t5_2qh34,False,,,True,t3_l4yf6,http://www.reddit.com/r/humor/comments/l4yf6/theres_some_truth_to_that/,

Nationalism does nothing but teach you how to hate people that you never met. 

And all of a sudden you take pride in accomplishments you had no part in whatsoever, and you brag about- and the Americans’ll go “Fuck the French! Fuck the French, if we hadn’t had saved their ass in two World Wars, they’d be speakin’ German right now!”

And you go, “Oh, was that us?” 

Was that me and you, Tommy, we saved the French? 

Jesus! I know I blacked out a little bit after that fourth shot of Jägermeister last night, but I don’t remember… I know we went through the Wendy’s drive-thru to get one of them “Freschetta” sandwiches that looked so alluring on the commercial, but then we ordered it and realized we had no money, and we had to ditch out before the second window, and those douchebags in line behind us with the bass music probably got our order and we laughed about that. 

But I don’t remember savin’ the French. 

At all! 

I went through the last ten calls on my cell phone and there’s nothin’ incoming or outgoing to the French, lookin’ for muscle on a project! I checked my pants, there’s no mud stains on the knees from where we were garroting Krauts in the trenches at Verdun.

The driver, a young man in a Brioni suit, Gucci shoes, RayBan sunglasses and YSL tie, leaned out the window and asked the farmer, ""If I tell you exactly how many cows and calves you have in your herd, will you give me a calf?""

Bill looks at the man, obviously a yuppie, then looks at his peacefully grazing herd and calmly answers, ""Sure, why not?""

The yuppie parks his car, whips out his Dell notebook computer, connects it to his Cingular RAZR V3 cell phone, and surfs to a NASA page on the Internet, where he calls up a GPS satellite to get an exact fix on his location which he then feeds to another NASA satellite that scans the area in an ultra-high-resolution photo.

The young man then opens the digital photo in Adobe Photoshop and exports it to an image processing facility in Hamburg, Germany.

Within seconds, he receives an email on his Palm Pilot that the image has been processed and the data stored. He then accesses an MS-SQL database through an ODBC connected Excel spreadsheet with email on his Blackberry and, after a few minutes, receives a response. Finally, he prints out a full-colour, 150-page report on his hi-tech, miniaturized HP LaserJet printer, turns to the farmer and says, ""You have exactly 1,586 cows and calves.""

""That's right. Well, I guess you can take one of my calves,"" says Bill.

He watches the young man select one of the animals and looks on with amusement as the young man stuffs it into the boot of his car.

Then Bill says to the young man, ""Hey, if I can tell you exactly what your business is, will you give me back my calf?""

The young man thinks about it for a second and then says, ""Okay, why not?""

""You're a Member of the European Parliament"", says Bill.

""Wow! That's correct,"" says the yuppie, ""but how did you guess that?""

""No guessing required."" answered the farmer. ""You showed up here even though nobody called you; you want to get paid for an answer I already knew, to a question I never asked. You used millions of pounds worth of equipment trying to show me how much smarter than me you are; and you don't know a thing about how working people make a living - or about cows, for that matter. This is a herd of sheep""...

Now that /r/funny ""won,"" I'd like to distinguish /r/humor so it isn't redundant. So this is now the subreddit for humor that requires a little more thinking or reading or time than /r/funny. 

Good submissions include long satire pieces, full Onion articles, videos longer than 10 minutes, or long forum threads that aren't just puns or rehashing internet memes. 

Bad submissions include pratfalls, keyboard cats, Successories poster parodies, Downfall videos, internet meme jokes, links to 4chan threads, or wacky-looking pictures.

The idea is that we're going to start moderating this to start things off, to kind of give people the idea of the flavor of submissions we're looking for, but hopefully after that, people will figure it out and start voting accordingly. 

I hope this isn't seen as some kind of censorship:

* This subreddit is not nearly as active as /r/funny, so there hasn't really been an /r/humor ""community"" to really speak of.
* If you don't like this idea, post your submissions to /r/funny instead. It's more highly trafficked anyhow.
* There are many more humor-based subforums to post in if you prefer to submit your link to a less-trafficked subreddit than /r/funny.

I've also added some moderators to help out. Thanks for staying subscribed and for your submissions!

Edit: I notice some submitters are testing me already. Your submissions have been mercilessly deleted ;)",,False,,t5_2qh34,True,,,True,t3_9iy1w,http://www.reddit.com/r/humor/comments/9iy1w/rhumor_changes_this_is_now_a_subreddit_for_funny/,moderator

I have suspected for some time now that my wife has been cheating on me. The usual signs: if the phone rings and I answer, the caller hangs up; she goes  out with the girls a lot. I try to stay awake to look out for her when she comes home but I usually fall asleep.

 

Anyway last night about midnight I hid in the shed behind the boat. When she came home she got out of someone's car buttoning her blouse, then she took her panties out of her purse and slipped them on.

 

It was at that moment crouched behind the boat that I noticed a hairline crack in the outboard engine mounting bracket.

 

Is that something I can weld or do I need to replace it?",,False,,t5_2qh34,False,,,True,t3_frz6o,http://www.reddit.com/r/humor/comments/frz6o/a_letter_to_the_mens_helpline/,

One day in the future, George Bush has a heart attack and dies. He immediately goes to hell, where the devil is waiting for him.
""I don't know what to do,"" says the devil. ""You are on my list, but I have no room for you. You definitely have to stay here, so I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I've got some folks here who weren't quite as bad as you. I'll let one of them go, but you have to take their place.
I'll even let YOU decide who leaves."" Bush thought that sounded pretty good, so the devil opened the first room.

In it was Ronald Reagan and a large pool of water. He kept diving in and surfacing empty handed. Over and over and over. Such was his fate in hell. ""No, George said. ""I don't think so. I'm not a good swimmer and I don't think I could do that all day long.""

The devil led him to the next room. In it was Richard Nixon with a sledge hammer and a room full of rocks. All he did was swing that hammer, time after time after time. ""No, I've got this problem with my shoulder. I would be in constant agony if all I could do was break rocks all day,"" commented George.

The devil opened a third door. In it, Bush saw Bill Clinton, lying on the floor with his arms staked over his head, and his legs staked in a spread eagle pose. Bent over him was Monica Lewinsky, doing what she does best. Bush took this in disbelief and finally said, ""Yea, I can handle this."" The devil smiled and said ""OK, Monica, you're free to go.""",,False,,t5_2qh34,False,,,True,t3_c6kib,http://www.reddit.com/r/humor/comments/c6kib/george_bush_goes_to_hell_joke/,

1348660476.0,268,self.humor,10i39m,Replacement Refs seething over the incompetence of the Green Bay Packers,501,233,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/humor/comments/10i39m/replacement_refs_seething_over_the_incompetence/,"After enduring three weeks of criticism, the patience of the replacement referees looks to be coming to an end. Anonymous members of the second-rate pin stripers began to quietly express their frustration on Sunday, and it only increased after Monday night’s game in which the Seattle Seahawks beat the Green Bay Packers on a controversial final touchdown. The source of their anger? The Packers themselves, and the atrocious way they played.

“Look, we have been open and honest with the players, the league and the fans. We suck. Period. How much clearer do we have to be? So why does a quality team like the Packers let themselves suck just as bad, to the point where we have to be relied on to make critical decisions?”

Said another “What are they complaining about? Didn’t they watch week 1 and week 2 games? We were awful. A travesty. So how can a premier team like Green Bay be leading the frickin’ Seahawks by only 5 points late in the 4th? They’re just begging us to decide the game for them. How’s that workin’ for ya, cheeseheads?”

One Lingerie League veteran who had been busy missing obvious penalties on Sunday watched the Monday night game at home.  “My fellow refs stunk up the place, no doubt about it,” adding with a shake of his head “but those Packers. Holy crap they were bad! Now they’re mad at US for blowing the game! That’s rich.” This ref continued “What is it going to take for the league to step in and do something about this Packer team and the amateur level of their play. I mean, it makes us look real bad to have to make decisions.  Really, though, I feel bad for the fans. They deserve better.”

“Look at what Green Bay accomplished in 60 minutes of football,” said another ref speaking on condition of anonymity. “Rodgers was sacked like what, eight times! Zero touchdown passes. They fumbled twice, they only had six points in the first half and twelve points in total!” When the missed two-point conversion was also suggested, the part-time ref got glassy-eyed and said “Oh yeah. I remember that. I couldn’t follow it. I don’t really get that rule.”

“And the last two minutes. The last two minutes!” yelled another scab whistle-blower who got quite agitated. “This team that was 15-1 last year is up by 5 – BY 5 AGAINST THE SEAHAWKS – and they have the ball. All they have to do is kill the clock. Hey, I’m a replacement ref but even I can figure that out. A couple runs, a couple of passes, a couple of first downs, boom, game over. What do they do? Minus 5 yards, and fumble. C’mon! Who DOES that? It’s like they want us to look bad.”

“Did they really want us to keep out of the game? I would! We’re total unadulterated crap! You don’t want us deciding important things, like plays and stuff. Settle it yourself and don’t put the heat on us! And that last play! Every defensive player in the country is watching and saying ‘Just knock it down, just knock it down.’ Jennings, man, if he knocks it down, game over, we refs scrape by with our meager talents and poor judgment, no problems. BUT NO. The guy tries to catch it in a crowd. The guy is BEGGING for us to come in with our unique bullsh*t decisions and bad vision. And we blow the call. WE knew we would. THEY knew we would. So why are they complaining? Score some touchdowns, manage the clock, knock the frickin’ ball down on the last play, but instead you SUCK, and then complain about US sucking. Which, y'know, we did.”

“Oh yeah. That was a terrible decision on his part” said another about Jennings' attempted interception. “How terrible? Let me put it this way”, said the ref who has made some remarkably bad decisions in the first three weeks. “I would have tried to make that catch.”",,False,,t5_2qh34,1348682616.0,,,True,t3_10i39m,http://www.reddit.com/r/humor/comments/10i39m/replacement_refs_seething_over_the_incompetence/,

The auditor said, 'Well, sir, you have an extravagant lifestyle and no full-time employment, Which you explain by saying that you win money gambling. I'm not sure the IRS finds that believable.'

I'm a great gambler, and I can prove it,' says Grandpa. 'How about a demonstration?'

The auditor thinks for a moment and said, 'Okay. Go ahead.'

Grandpa says, 'I'll bet you a thousand dollars that I can bite my own eye.'

The auditor thinks a moment and says, 'It's a bet.'

Grandpa removes his glass eye and bites it. The auditor's jaw drops.

Grandpa says, 'Now, I'll bet you two thousand dollars that I can bite my other eye.'

Now the auditor can tell Grandpa isn't blind, so he takes the bet.

Grandpa removes his dentures and bites his good eye.

The stunned auditor now realizes he has wagered and lost three grand, with Grandpa's attorney as a witness. He starts to get nervous.

 'Want to go double or nothing?' Grandpa asks 'I'll bet you six thousand dollars that I can stand on one side of your desk, and pee into that wastebasket on the other side, and never get a drop anywhere in 
between.'

The auditor, twice burned, is cautious now, but he looks carefully and decides there's no way this old guy could possibly manage that stunt, so he agrees again.

Grandpa stands beside the desk and unzips his pants, but although he strains mightily, he can't make the stream reach the wastebasket on the other side, so he pretty much urinates all over the auditor's desk.

The auditor leaps with joy, realizing that he has just turned a major loss into a huge win.

But Grandpa's own attorney moans and puts his head in his hands. 'Are you okay?' the auditor asks.

'Not really, says the attorney. 'This morning, when Grandpa told me he'd been summoned for an audit, he bet me twenty-five thousand dollars that he could come in here and piss all over your desk and that you'd be happy about it!'

They couldn't do it while he waited, so he said he didn't live far and would just walk home.
On the way home he stopped at the hardware Store and bought a bucket and a gallon of paint. He then stopped by the feed store and picked up a couple of chickens and a goose. However, struggling outside the store he now had a problem - how to carry his entire purchases home.
While he was scratching his head he was approached by a little old lady who told him she was lost. She asked, 'Can you tell me how to get to 1603 Mockingbird Lane ?' The farmer said, 'Well, as a matter of fact, my farm is very close to that house I would walk you there but I can't carry this lot.'
The old lady suggested, 'Why don't you put the can of paint in the bucket. Carry the bucket in one hand, put a chicken under each arm and carry the goose in your other hand?'
'Why thank you very much,' he said and proceeded to walk the old girl home.
On the way he says 'Let's take my short cut and go down this alley. We'll be there in no time.'
The little old lady looked him over cautiously then said, 'I am a lonely widow without a husband to defend me.. How do I know that when we get in the alley you won't hold me up against the wall, pull up my skirt, and have your way with me?'
The farmer said, 'Holy smokes lady! I'm carrying a bucket, a gallon of paint, two chickens, and a goose. How in the world could I possibly hold you up against the wall and do that?'
The old lady replied, 'Set the goose down, cover him with the bucket, put the paint on top of the bucket, and I'll hold the chickens.

The man says, 'A hamburger, fries and a coke,' and turns to the ostrich, 'What's yours?'

'I'll have the same,' says the ostrich.

A short time later the waitress returns with the order 'That will be $9.40 please,' and the man reaches into his pocket and pulls out the exact change for payment.

The next day, the man and the ostrich come again and the man says, 'A hamburger, fries and a coke'

The ostrich says, 'I'll have the same.'

Again the man reaches into his pocket and pays with exact change.

This becomes routine until the two enter again. 'The usual?' asks the waitress.

'No, this is Friday night, so I will have a steak, baked potato and a salad,' says the man.

'Same,' says the ostrich.

Shortly the waitress brings the order and says, 'That will be $32.62.'

Once again the man pulls the exact change out of his pocket and places it on the table.

The waitress cannot hold back her curiosity any longer. 'Excuse me, sir. How do you manage to always come up with the exact change in your pocket every time?

'Well,' says the man, 'several years ago I was cleaning the attic and found an old lamp. When I rubbed it, a Genie apeared and offered me two wishes. My first wish was that if I ever had to pay for anything, I would just put my hand in my pocket and the right amount of money would always be there.'

'That's brilliant!' says the waitress. Most people would ask for a million dollars or something, but you'll always be as rich as you want for as long as you live. It's brilliant!'

'That's right. Whether it's a gallon of milk or a Rolls Royce, the exact amount of money is always there,' says the man.

The waitress asks, 'What's with the ostrich?'

The man sighs, pauses and answers, 'My second wish was for a tall chick with a big butt and long legs who agrees with everything I say.'

Very few moms get my humor.,525,277,67,http://www.reddit.com/r/humor/comments/fpq77/army_grunt_now_owns_child_play_center_very_few/,"After 10 years in the military as an infantry soldier, I took that experience and did what anyone with my skills would do.  I opened a Child Play Center...weird...I know.  Still, I love my job and my shop.  However, I have found my sense of humor (Army Grunt) is different from most of the moms who are my customers.  So, for you few moms and those of you with ""grunt"" humor, here is a list of things I am no longer allowed to say in my Child Fun Center:


When asked what I do by a cop I cannot answer, “I blow shit up”

When asked, “What are you buying next for the kids” I cannot answer, “Ritalin”

When asked, “Do you know what the worst part about my children is?” I cannot answer, “You can’t return them”

When talking to a father who has a NASCAR shirt on I cannot say, “Let me break this down into something you can understand. In car terms you child is like a flat tire on the last turn of the indy 500. There’s a big problem and I am pretty sure someone is gonna beat him”.

When asked, “What do you think the fastest way to get a child’s attention is?” I cannot respond, “sit down and look comfortable”

When overhearing a LeLuche meeting (breast feeding group) and someone says, “Do you what the most appealing feature is of breast feeding?” I will not interrupt with, “The attractive containers it comes in?”

When asked by a little brat, “Will Santa be here this year?” I will not respond, “Yep, but he told me he doesn’t want to see you”.

When asked by a parent if I know if there any problems with a particular play pen, I will not reply, “Yeah…it only works if you use it upside down”.

When asked by a mom, “Can you help me catch my child?” I will not respond with, “Yeah…let me go get my pepper spray.” And then run off to the back of the shop laughing wildly.

I will not call fathers who come into my shop, “Puff Daddies”

When a 4 year old little girl keeps taking her shirt off I will not tell her, “You must keep your shirt on until you are in college hun…those are the rules here.”

After being told by a very old fashioned woman that working at a child play center is not very dignified work for a “Trained killer” such as myself and that to always remember dress for the job I want, I will not start taking my clothes off and tell her, “Well hell, I have always wanted to work in porn”.

When asked what kind of plants we have hanging from the ceiling I will not respond with “Boston ivy, English ivy and some Cannabis Sativa way up there where the cops can’t see it”.

I will remember that “Bone us” and “Bonus” sound the same. (It’s too long a story to write, but I am sure you can come up with your own joke that is just as funny).

I am not allowed to hand a hammer to someone who says, “I just don’t know what to do with him”.

I am not allowed to spray children with Febreeze 

I am not allowed to perform mock exorcisms on bad children…or real exorcisms.

I am not allowed to wear stickers I find at Albertson. Especially if it says, “Take Me Home, I'm Delicious""….nor am I allowed to apply them to my customers

“The worst STD you can catch” is not pregnancy and I am not allowed to tell pregnant women that a little Motrin will clear that swelling right up.

When asked where the party room is by white trash mom and her hoodlum child, I am not allowed to point toward “Pump-it-Up” (my competitor).

There is no such thing as a bouncing baby boy…they just kind of splat 

I am not allowed to ask husbands with bitchy wives , “What bet did you lose?”

I am not allowed to tell small children who just grab food off the counter that I am Islamic and now, “By the Law of God, I get to cut off your hand!”

“A little childhood trauma builds character.” Is never the answer.

After a child slips on the tile floor from water he poured on it, I am not allowed to say, “So I guess your vote for the new indoor skating rink is no?”

I am not allowed to hand sales calls to my 2 year old son.

I am not allowed to offer to teach detestable children how to smoke

I should not tell the bitchy office worker to put her child’s photo on her computer and then hand her a few magnets to hold it in place.

When people ask me for a discount before they ask how much it is, I am not allowed to say, “Sure!” and then add $2

I am not allowed to mouth bad words at children….or insults….or threats

Hand sanitizer does not “Keep Satan out”

I am not allowed to offer a child money to kick the crap out of another child

I am not allowed to take pictures of children and their parents and send them to epicfail.com

I am not allowed to tell children I don’t like that hand sanitizer tastes like ice cream

I will not shuffle around in my socks on the carpet and prove to children that I am ""THOR, GOD OF THUNDER!""

When asked by women what I would do with their snotty 2 year old brat I will not respond, ""Send him to Tailand, business class, and let him make some real money"".

When asked for my vast experience in childhood behavior as to what will help her child calm down, I will not respond ""Exorcism""

Children are not Satan's greatest gift to man

I may not raffle off children whose parents are not watching them

I will not refer to men who come in by themselves with children as having ""Feminine Issues""

I will not tell children I don't like that Santa hates them

I will not trip running children to help explain to Jayde the principles of gravity

I will not answer the shop phone as ""Child Protective Services"" and when they say they called the wrong number say ""No, no, I was calling you"".
