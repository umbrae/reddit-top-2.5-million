1352299644.0,70,self.Objectivism,12sr0a,I encourage you to shrug.  I did it &amp; so can you.,96,26,75,http://www.reddit.com/r/Objectivism/comments/12sr0a/i_encourage_you_to_shrug_i_did_it_so_can_you/,"I'm not certain of the demographics of reddit users, or specifically of this sub-forum.  So, I'm going to assume you're relatively young, relatively well educated, and have skills that are economically viable.  You're probably making good money too.

Shrugging is going to vary from person to person. I'm going to talk a bit about the method that worked for me, but your choices are likely to be different so I won't go into too many specifics.

While I'm not aware of any actual gulches one can relocate to, there are many choices, both within and without the USA that can allow you to insulate yourself from supporting the beast.  Simply moving from a high tax state to one with no state taxes is one way.  Keeping your legal income below the taxable rate is another (though likely not appealing to us capitalists).  If you live outside the USA (have bonafide residency or spend 330+ days a year) then a large amount (I believe $85,000 a year) of your income earned from a foreign corporation is not taxable.    

There are people working to make gulch like cities in Honduras, and there are various other initiatives[1], but there are also a lot of countries that are closer to our ideal than the USA is now.  For instance, Panama now offers residency to any business person who chooses to live there (and after 5-10 years you can get citizenship).   Their tax structure is straightforward, and they respect property rights, etc.  There are at least a half dozen possibilities, and actually once you get outside the USA and start looking you find more and more.

I think the main thing stopping people from shrugging is the high hurdle of inertia. 

Here's what you need to do it: 

1. Skills that are marketable.  Ideally skills that can be sold online. (Eg: you make software, are a designer (graphic or interaction), a writer, or entrepreneur, etc.) 

2. A good current job to save up $20-40k

3. The conviction to do it (Eg: a willingness to live frugally until you get the capital saved up, and afterwards until you've got an income that lets you live better.) 

There are also three phases:

1. Build up your skills and your savings, and do as much research as you can into the various places to relocate to find one that best fits your needs.  I highly encourage you to consider just being a nomad... I've been nomadic for several years and my preferences and perspective have changed significantly after leaving the USA.

2. Build up a business on the side while working (if you can) or work out the right business, and learn all you can about how to make this business. Preferably a business you can do from anywhere, but there really are hug opportunities out there.  For instance, there is no Amazon.com in central and south america.  These are countries that are RIPE for such a business.  Whatever your area of expertise you can find that there are opportunities out there, possibly where there's even less competition in america.   One of the things that America has that other countries don't is a culture of entrepreneurism.  So, even though a country might have solid property rights and a low tax structure (like Panama) there is still huge opportunity simply because locals don't think ""I want to start my own company!"" -- they don't want to take the risk.  (And I'm just picking panama as an example, this is true in europe, central and south america as well, and probably other places I've never been.)

3. Shrug.  That's it.  Go.  Go pursue your life and your business and see the world while your at it.  One of the best possibilities is to be a perpetual tourist.  Countries treat tourists well, even if they would give you nothing but red tape if you tried to start a business there.   Domicile your business in an advantageous locations (for instance, Hong Kong and Singapore only tax business done there or profits imported into the countries)... but live wherever.   Or buy a retreat in rural Wyoming if that's your preferred method.

But don't stay stuck in an Urban hell in america, unhappy.  See the world, or go live in your idea of paradise.  Figure out the compromises that you're willing to make and embrace the differences you find there.

I once was in central alaska, near Mt. McKinley, and far from any infrastructure, at a gas station, one of the few for hundreds of miles, and was so happy to get gas-- I'd gotten desperate.  Across from me was an RV with New York plates, and they got out and all they did was bitch and moan about the price of gas. (It was $1.60 a gallon when back in the lower 48 it was usually around $1.30 a gallon... so the price wasn't even that outrageous.) 

We were both in paradise, but they were unhappy.  Don't be them.  And don't stay in a situation that will cause you to become them. 

You can remove your support of the beast.   Sure, there's no perfect place, but consider Vanuatu.  It's a tiny island.  Even if it had the same tax rates as the USA, it would be much better to pay that government, which isn't exactly going to be projecting a military force across the world, or paving the way for global socialism-- than to pay the same money to a beast in a position to do more damage to your life and the lives of those you care about. 

Galt's Gulch is where you make it!



[1]  Casey has a vinyard in Argentina.  Simon Black has a working farm in Chile.  Both of these are primarily real estate projects sold at a handsome markup to people who want something pre-packaged.  Potential gulches there, but if you're more frugal, you can get much the same thing for less (or go buy neighboring land and let them buy you out in future years if their projects are successful.)

While it's admirable in a way, I need a little more stability if we're going to make this work. How can I gently break this to him?""*

Andrew's response:

&gt; ""Don't you dare say anything to him about giving up his dreams.  You're not the right person for him.  Never ask someone to give up on their dreams just so you can feel more stable.  It's his choice and his choice alone, no matter how ridiculous his dream may seem to you, or to society, or even to himself.  Dreams make humans into self-realized individuals.  Your only responsibility is to love everything about him, including his dreams.  The idea of 'making this work' sounds more like a way to make his life more boring and predictable.  At worst, it's a genuine sadistic desire to control someone else because your own life feels out of control -- or a cruel need to dominate and break someone's spirit for the sake of your own peace of mind.

One of the ways critics try to dismiss Ayn Rand and the entire free market position more broadly, is by labeling it “anti-government.” Since government is obviously necessary, the charge is meant to paint the free market position as crazy and out of touch.

It’s a bizarre characterization. Rand, for instance, penned an entire essay—available for free on the web even—in which she explained why we need government. Far from a necessary evil, the pro-capitalist view regards government as a necessary good.

The key issue is: what kind of government? The capitalist position recognizes that some governments aren’t good. When government stops protecting its citizens and starts seizing their wealth and taking away their freedom, that government is neither necessary nor good.

The critics paint free market thinkers as anti-government because of the kind of government they, the critics, support: the wealth-taking, rights-violating regulatory-welfare state. But equating “anti-statism” with “anti-state” is like saying that a person is anti-computer because he’s against using them to hack into people’s bank accounts.

If Ayn Rand was anti-state because she opposed rights-violating governments, then so were the Founding Fathers. After all, they, like her, believed that government’s function was crucial but strictly limited. In Jefferson’s immortal words,

    a wise and frugal Government, which shall restrain men from injuring one another, shall leave them otherwise free to regulate their own pursuits of industry and improvement, and shall not take from the mouth of labor the bread it has earned.

After 5 years of love and with an upcoming wedding date, my fiance left me. He wasn't happy with me and wanted to experience life on his own. It hurt, terribly, to think that after all I've given the relationship, all the love I had for him, this is what happens. He leaves.

So, like any good objectivist that strangely approaches Ayn Rand like a Bible, I reread passages from The Fountainhead. How Roark dealt with Dominique leaving him and sleeping with other men, how Keating felt, How Wynand felt, etc., all gave me very vaulable insight into this break-up.

Essentially, I now know there is nothing I can rationally do. I can't force him to stay with me. I won't beg him. I respect his decision, and I am glad that he is seeking happiness. I don't like the idea that his happiness doesn't involve me, but I like even less the idea that I was a barrier to his happiness. I wish him well, and if someday we mutually agree to start again, then I will accept and embrace him again. But for now, I have to move on for my own health and peace of mind. I will create new goals. I will still strive for my dreams. I will be happy.

I posted the following on r/philosophy, and so, could I get some of your opinions?

Original post: ""Why does liking ""Atlas Shrugged"" by Ayn Rand mean you have terrible taste in literature? Referenced from [xkcd](http://xkcd.com/1049/). I suppose the bigger question I want to ask is: why does everyone dislike Ayn Rand and her philosophy so much? In my opinion, her Objectivism is a pretty...I don't know... *heroic* philosophy, and the story she used to explain it was well written and engaging in my opinion. However, I'd very much like to understand why it seems like she's...sort of this [detested figure](http://imgur.com/Kln6A) in the philosophy and literary realms.

(I figured r/philosophy might be a better place to post this than r/literature since you guys seem to comment more often, but if you have any recommendations as to where I should x-post this, please feel free to comment that as well).

1369579172.0,29,self.Objectivism,1f2yxy,The least popular but most chilling of Rand's character speeches - Toohey's confession to Keating.,33,4,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/Objectivism/comments/1f2yxy/the_least_popular_but_most_chilling_of_rands/," ""What do you want Ellsworth ?""

""Power, Petey. I want to rule. Like my spiritual predecessors. But I’m luckier than they were. I inherited the fruit of their efforts and I shall be the one who’ll see the great dream made real. I see it all around me today. I recognise it. I don’t like it. I didn’t expect to like it. Enjoyment is not my destiny. I shall find such satisfaction as my capacity permits. I shall rule.""

""Whom...?""

""You. The world. It’s only a matter of discovering the lever. If you learn how to rule one single man’s soul, you can get the rest of mankind. It’s the soul, Peter, the soul. Not whips or swords or fire or guns. That’s why the Caesars, the attilas, the Napoleons were fools and did not last. We will. The soul, Peter, is that which can’t be ruled. It must be broken. Drive a wedge in, get your fingers on it – and the man is yours. You won’t need a whip – he’ll bring it to you and ask to be whipped. Set him in reverse – and his own mechanism will do your work for you. Use him against himself. Want to know how it’s done? See if I ever lied to you. See if you haven’t heard all this for years, but didn’t want to hear, and the fault is yours, not mine.

There are many ways. Here’s one. Make man feel small. Make him feel guilty. Kill his aspiration and his integrity. That’s difficult. The worst among you gropes for an idol in his own twisted way. Kill integrity by internal corruption. Use it against himself. Direct it towards a goal destructive of all integrity. Preach selflessness. Tell man that altruism is the ideal. Not a single one has ever reached it and not a single one ever will. His every living instinct screams against it. But don’t you see what you accomplish ? Man realises that he’s incapable of what he’s accepted as the noblest virtue - and it gives him a sense of guilt, of sin, of his own basic unworthiness. Since the supreme ideal is beyond his grasp, he gives up eventually all ideals, all aspiration, all sense of his personal value. He feels himself obliged to preach what he can’t practice. But one can’t be good halfway or honest approximately. To preserve one’s integrity is a hard battle. Why preserve that which one knows to be corrupt already? His soul gives up its self respect. You’ve got him. He’ll obey. He’ll be glad to obey – because he can’t trust himself, he feels uncertain, he feels unclean. That’s one way.

Here’s another. Kill man’s sense of values. Kill his capacity to recognise greatness or to achieve it. Great men can’t be ruled. We don’t want any great men. Don’t deny conception of greatness. Destroy it from within. The great is the rare, the difficult, the exceptional. Set up standards of achievement open to all, to the least, to the most inept – and you stop the impetus to effort in men, great or small. You stop all incentive to improvement, to excellence, to perfection. Laugh at Roark and hold Peter Keating as a great architect. You’ve destroyed architecture. Build Lois Cook and you’ve destroyed literature. Hail Ike and you’ve destroyed the theatre. Glorify Lancelot Clankey and you’ve destroyed the press. Don’t set out to raze all shrines – you’ll frighten men, Enshrine mediocrity - and the shrines are razed.

Then there’s another way. Kill by laughter. Laughter is an instrument of human joy. Learn to use it as a weapon of destruction. Turn it into a sneer. It’s simple. Tell them to laugh at everything. Tell them that a sense of humour is an unlimited virtue. Don't let anything remain sacred in a man’s soul – and his soul won’t be sacred to him. Kill reverence and you’ve killed the hero in man. One doesn’t reverence with a giggle. He’ll obey and he’ll set no limits to obedience – anything goes – nothing is too serious.

Here’s another way. This is most important. Don't allow men to be happy. Happiness is self-contained and self-sufficient. Happy men have no time and no use for you. Happy men are free men. So kill their joy in living. Take away from them what they want. Make them think that the mere thought of a personal desire is evil. Bring them to a state where saying ‘I want’ is no longer a natural right, but a shameful admission. Altruism is of great help in this. Unhappy men will come to you. They’ll need you. They’ll come for consolation, for support, for escape. Nature allows no vacuum. Empty man’s soul – and the space is yours to fill.

I don’t see why you should look so shocked, Peter. This is the oldest one of all. Look back at history. Look at any great system of ethics, from the Orient up. Didn’t they all preach the sacrifice of personal joy ? Under all the complications of verbiage, haven’t they all had a single leitmotif: sacrifice, renunciation, self-denial ? Haven’t you been able to catch their theme song – ‘Give up, give up, give up, give up’ ? Look at the moral atmosphere of today. Everything enjoyable, from cigarettes to sex to ambition to the profit motive, is considered depraved or sinful. Just prove that a thing makes men happy and you’ve damned it. That’s how far we’ve come. We’ve tied happiness to guilt. And we’ve got mankind by the throat.

Throw your first born into a sacrificial furnace – lie on a bed of nails – go into the desert to mortify the flesh – don’t dance – don't go to the movies on Sunday – don't try to get rich – don’t smoke – don’t drink. It’s all the same line. The great line. Fools don’t think that taboos of this nature are just nonsense. Something left over, old-fashioned. But there’s always a purpose in nonsense. Don’t bother to examine a folly – ask yourself only what it accomplishes. Every system of ethics that preached sacrifice grew into a world power and ruled millions of men.

Of course, you must dress them up. You must tell people they’ll achieve a superior kind of happiness by giving up everything that makes them happy. You don't have to be too clear about it. Use big vague words. ‘Universal Harmony’ – ‘Eternal Spirit’ – ‘Divine Purpose’ – ‘Nirvana’ - ‘Paradise’ – ‘Racial Supremacy’ – ‘the Dictatorship of the Proletariat.’ Internal corruption, Peter. That’s the oldest one of all. The farce has been going on for centuries and men still fall for it.

Yet the test should be so simple: just listen to any prophet and if you hear him speak of sacrifice – run. Run faster than from a plague. It stands to reason that where there’s sacrifice, there’s someone collecting sacrificial offerings. Where there’s service, there’s someone being served. The man who speaks to you of sacrifice, speaks of slaves and masters. And intends to be the master. But if you ever hear a man telling you that you must be happy, that it’s your natural right, that your first duty is to yourself – that will be the man who has nothing to gain from you. But let him come and you’ll scream your empty heads off, howling that he’s a selfish monster. So the racket is safe for many, many centuries.

But here you might have noticed something. I said, ‘It stands to reason’. Do you see ? Men have a weapon against you. Reason. So you must be very sure to take it away from them. Cut the props from under it. But be careful. Don’t deny outright. Never deny anything outright, you give your hand away. Don’t say reason is evil – though some have gone that far and with astonishing success. Just say that reason is limited. That there’s something above it. What ? You don’t have to be too clear about it either. The field’s inexhaustible. ‘Instinct’ – ‘Feeling’ – ‘Revelation’ – ‘Divine Intuition’ – ‘Dialectic Materialism’. If you get caught at some crucial point and somebody tells you that your doctrine doesn’t make sense – you’re ready for him. You tell him there’s something above sense. That here he must not try to think, he must feel. He must believe. Suspend reason and you play it deuces wild. Anything goes in any manner you wish whenever you need it. You’ve got him. Can you rule a thinking man ? We don’t want any thinking men.""

Keating had sat down on the floor, by the side of the dresser. He did not want to abandon the dresser; he felt safer, leaning against it.

""Peter, you’ve heard all this. You’ve seen me practising it for ten years. You see it being practised all over the world. Why are you disgusted ? You have no right to sit there and stare at me with the virtuous superiority of being shocked. You’re in on it. You’ve taken your share and you’ve got to go along. You’re afraid to see where it’s leading. I’m not. I’ll tell you.

The world of the future. The world I want. A world of obedience and of unity. A world where the thought of each man will not be his own, but an attempt to guess the thought of the next neighbour who’ll have no thought – and so on, Peter, around the globe. Since all must agree with all. A world where no man will hold a desire for himself, but will direct all his efforts to satisfy the desires of his neighbour who’ll have no desires except to satisfy the desires of the next neighbour, who’ll have no desires – around the globe, Peter. Since all must serve all. A world in which man will not work for so innocent an incentive as money, but for that headless monster – prestige. The approval of his fellows – their good opinion – the opinion of men who’ll be allowed to hold no opinion. An octopus, all tentacles and no brain.

Judgement, Peter ! Not judgement, but public polls. An average drawn upon zeroes – since no individuality will be permitted. A world with its motor cut off and a single heart, pumped by hand. My hand – and the hands of a few, a very few other men like me. Those who know what makes you tick – you great, wonderful average, you who have not risen in fury when we called you the average, the little, the common, you who’ve liked and accepted these names. You’ll sit enthroned and enshrined, you, the little people, the absolute ruler to make all past rulers squirm with envy, the absolute, the unlimited, God and Prophet and King combined. Vox populi. The average, the common, the general.

Do you know the proper antonym for Ego ? Bromide, Peter. The rule of the bromide. But even the trite has to be organised by someone at some time. We’ll do the organising. Vox dei. We’ll enjoy unlimited submission – from men who’ve learned nothing except to submit. We’ll call it ‘to serve’. We’ll give out medals for service. You’ll fall over one another in a scramble to see who can submit better and more. There will be no other distinction to seek. No other form of personal achievement.

Can you see Howard Roark in this picture ? No ? Then don’t waste time on foolish questions. Everything that can’t be ruled, must go. And if freaks persist in being born occasionally, they will not survive beyond their twelfth year. When their brain begins to function, it will feel the pressure and it will explode. The pressure gauged to a vacuum. Do you know the fate of deep-sea creatures brought out to sunlight? So much for future Roarks. The rest of you will smile and obey. Have you noticed that the imbecile always smiles ? Man’s first frown is the first touch of God on his forehead. The touch of thought. But we’ll have neither God nor thought. Only voting by smiles. Automatic levers – all saying yes...

Now if you were a little more intelligent, you’d ask: What of us, the rulers ? What of me, Ellsworth Monkton Toohey ? And I’d say, Yes, you’re right. I’ll achieve no more than you will. I’ll have no purpose save to keep you contended. To lie, to flatter you, to praise you, to inflate your vanity. To make speeches about the people and the common good. Peter, my poor old friend, I’m the most selfless man you’ve ever known. I have less independence than you, whom I just forced to sell your soul. You’ve used people at least for the sake of what you could get from them for yourself. I want nothing for myself. I use people for the sake of what I can do to them. It’s my only function and satisfaction. I have no private purpose. I want power. I want my world of the future. Let all live for all. Let all sacrifice and none profit. Let all suffer and none enjoy. Let progress stop. Let all stagnate. There’s equality in stagnation. All subjugated to the will of all. Universal slavery – without even the dignity of a master. Slavery to slavery. A great circle – and a total equality. The world of the future.""

""Ellsworth... you’re...""

""Insane ? Afraid to say it ? There you sit and the world’s written all over you, your last hope. Insane ? Look around you. Pick up any newspaper and read the headlines. Isn’t it coming ? Isn’t it here ? Every single thing I told you ? Isn’t Europe swallowed already and we’re stumbling on to follow ? Everything I said is contained in a single word – collectivism. And isn’t that the god of our century. To act together. To think – together. To feel – together. To unite, to agree, to obey. To obey, to serve, to sacrifice. Divide and conquer – first. But then, unite and rule. We’ve discovered that one last. Remember the Roman Emperor who said he wished humanity had a single neck so he could cut it ? People have laughed at him for centuries. But we’ll have the last laugh. We’ve accomplished what he couldn’t accomplish. We’ve taught men to unite. This makes one neck ready for one leash. We found the magic word. Collectivism.

Look at Europe, you fool. Can’t you see past the guff and recognise the essence ? One country is dedicated to the proposition that man has no rights, that the collective is all. The individual held as evil, the mass – as God. No motive and no virtue permitted – except that of service to the proletariat.

That’s one version. Here’s another. A country dedicated to the proposition that man has no rights, that the State is all. The individual held as evil, the race – as God. No motive and no virtue permitted – except that of service to the race. Am I raving or is this the harsh reality of two continents already ? If you’re sick of one version, we push you in the other. We’ve fixed the coin. Heads – collectivism. Tails – collectivism. Give up your soul to a council – or give it up to a leader. But give it up, give it up, give it up. Offer poison as food and poison as antidote. Go fancy on the trimmings, but hang on to the main objective. Give the fools a chance, let them have their fun – but don’t forget the only purpose you have to accomplish. Kill the individual. Kill man’s soul. The rest will follow automatically.""

I have been vary surprised by how much Anarcho-Capitalist material has been posted on this subreddit. Being that the subreddit is ""Objectivism"", which was a closed philosophical system developed by Ayn Rand. An important pillar in this system was the proper role of government, not a complete lack of government.

Ayn Rand was not a libertarian, you can see a detailed account of her disagreements with libertarians here:

http://www.aynrand.org/site/PageServer?pagename=ar_libertarianism_qa

Note that she mentions that ""Galt's Gulch"" was not an example of Anarcho-Capitalism, it was a private estate and would not translate to an entire society. ""Galt's Gulch"" consisted of a small number of extremely rational extremely intelligent individuals all brought to the valley by Galt himself. They could work out any disagreements they had rationally, but in the real world there are a great number of irrational people. 

I am not saying that everyone who posts about Anarcho-Capitalism is stupid (I was one myself for a brief period after I read ""For A New Liberty"", but after some thought I realized that such a society was impossible, I can elaborate if anyone wishes), or that no one should post about it anywhere. I am merely saying that if this is a subreddit for ""Objectivism"" then the posts on here should mainly be about Objectivism, not something opposed to Objectivism. I wouldn't expect to see people posting on here often touting Kant and Plato, unless they simply wanted to encourage a debate, which is perfectly fine within limits. I am merely suggesting that the MAJORITY of the posts on here should have something to do with ACTUAL Objectivism, not a misconstrued version.

China's development is fueled by private land development and foreign corporate trade. It's communist in name only. Cuba is opening up to the west, but it doesn't matter anyway; it has no influence anywhere. Radical communism/socialism in The States, and to a lesser degree in Europe, is less influential than it once was; most ""economically leftist"" parties are pushing for a slightly better funded welfare state, and even the ""moderate progressives"" of the New Deal are dying off. A ""frontal assault"" by collectivism is not happening.

The biggest problem to Capitalism, genuine free trade, is the cronyism and corporate welfare system that's been gradually growing in the US since the 80s. It's to the point where popular opinion seems to be that ""Capitalism"" is ""the government helping the corporations"" and ""Socialism"" is ""the government helping the people"". Tax cuts for corporations that provide ""campaign contributions"" to politicians, while many politicians then (correctly) accuse social welfare programs of being socialistic, gives Capitalism a bad rap.

Evidence? Look at the way that the outdated and inefficient music industry &amp; movie industry publish, distribute, and sell music, and abuse federal law to stall every technological development (and I'm not talking about entitled kids who steal music); they fought cassettes, VCRS, CDs, mp3s, streaming, ect with massive lawsuits aimed as crushing development and using federal meddling in the market to protect a poor business model from competitors.

If we want to keep a free market alive, we must realize that the best way to (using a metaphor) keep a burglar out of your house isn't to stand outside your front door thinking he's going to walk up the driveway; it's to lock your house up tight and be vigilant in all directions. We need to make people realize that Separation of Market &amp; State is a two-way street.

I began excited and participated regularly, sincerely trying to understand the relevance of everything she was teaching. Each class that passed me by, however, I realized more and more that everything I was saying led nowhere, so I went from active in participating to almost non-existent in that class.

Halfway through the semester the teacher talked to me and asked to have a personal meeting. I agreed and went to her office. She asked me, first, who was my favorite philosopher, phrased ""What are you reading that makes you think like you do?"" I answered, with slight hesitation, ""Ayn Rand."" She looked at me and said, ""Oh,"" as if to imply *now I understand why you're like this*.

She proceeded to call Ayn Rand a charlatan and accusing her of some mode of idealism suitable for young minds. ""I understand, but, you'll grow out of it."" I asked her, only, ""Have you ever read anything she's written?"" and this time she hesitated, saying, ""well... no.""

At the time of writing this, r/Objectivism has over 80 new subscribers within 48 hours of having a moderator take an active interest in promoting it.

Where do we go from here?  The question that might come to your mind is, ""We've already read all the same books and talked them to death for years, what do we talk about now?""  We all have many diverse interests in our individual pursuits of happiness.  To name a couple examples that seem to be common in the broader Objectivist subculture: physical health -- paleo diet, crossfit, body by science; psychology -- parenting, communication skills.  I'd like to see r/Objectivism become a nexus on reddit for diverse values that Objectivists might want to share, an alternative frontpage for people who want to divide the labor of finding interesting new things.

Why do Objectivists need their own subreddit for this?  As a subculture with many core values in common, we are bound to be interested in many of the same sorts of things.  Come here for a higher caliber of links and commentary on them.  If you have a blog yourself, pimp your posts here.

- ‎No action could be lower or more futile than for one person to throw upon another the burden of his abdication of choice.

- ‎""I am no good"" may be uttered only in the past tense. To say: ""I am no good"" is to declare ""---and I never intend to be any better.""

- Once I make a decision, either in regard to writing or to any other matter, I do not hesitate, vacillate or suffer over carrying it out.

We had a discussion in which I expressed how Rand had changed my perspective on life, and I tried to summarize it in one paragraph.  I'd be interested to hear your thoughts on this, thanks!


&gt;""At the heart of it is the idea that the only person responsible for and capable of securing my own happiness and fulfillment in life, is me. [Ayn Rand] taught me to look at the world as an active agent, not a passive observer; to realize that, while there are many things beyond my control in life, I can still use my mind and my life to be productive, positive, and great in the things that I do. And not only that, I learned to look at other people that way too. That's one reason I started the ALT.NET group [educational group for programmers] -- because I believe that there is greatness in people, and those are the people I want to be around. Another thing her books emphasize is that people are ""traders"" -- that we give and take, in both material and non-material ways, and this trading is what allows many individuals to act in concert as a society. Its easy to understand this in terms of physical things -- I trade my labor for a paycheck, for example. But we also trade in emotions, encouragement, knowledge, etc. Because Rand views people as heroic, and capable of greatness, she emphasized that when you trade ""value for value"" with someone, you should always trade your best for their best, realizing that by doing so, you have increased the sheer amount of AWESOME in the world. This is the honest way of living.""",,False,self,t5_2qjr6,False,,,True,t3_r526t,http://www.reddit.com/r/Objectivism/comments/r526t/can_anyone_else_identify_with_this_perspective_on/,

Here was our reasoning, in bullet-point form:

* going into a theater (for example) without paying for a ticket is fraud, an indirect form of force
* you're also withholding your sanction from the people that make the movie you enjoy (as well as the theater that presents it for you)
* illegal downloading is **even worse** because you're withholding the same sanction PLUS you're actually *giving* your sanction to sites that steal the content (they make a killing on ad revenue)
* (it's like paying a hoodlum $3 to sneak you into the movie for free; you are allowing the hoodlum to profit at the expense of the people who are actually involved in the movie)

Most of this I already understood implicitly, but piracy just seemed sooooo practical. However, as I'm starting to work harder for my money, I've discovered how much better it feels to purchase goods with money you've earned with your own blood and sweat - it's pure [eudaimonia.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eudaimonia)

It's as if the author/musician/maker of the good you're buying is saying: ""because of the value you've created, I've made this for you in return."" It's unbelievably satisfying, and it has profound long-term implications for your self-esteem.

So last night, I purged my iTunes/computer of ALL illegitimately-acquired music, movies, and tv shows. So much of the music on my computer had to be purged that I didn't even know if I could do it at first. 

But I can honestly say that this was one of the best decisions in my life. There is no feeling *in the world* like truly earning your way in life.

I apologize as this post isn't strictly discussion of Objectivism, but I thought it might be appreciated. I have started a student organization for Objectivists and the study of Objectivism at Indiana University- Bloomington, and our first meeting tonight was a success. We had about 20 students show up, after only a couple days of advertising. Most had a fairly high level of familiarity with the philosophy, and all seemed very excited to start studying. We even had a faculty member arrive who offered some suggestions and is part of a local Objectivist group. I am confident there are more students we can reach as well.

I know it's not a huge deal, but personally I was extremely encouraged by the result, and I wanted to share this achievement and hopefully encourage others in what can be a very frustrating political and philosophical environment. It may not seem like very much but it surpassed my expectations and it has invigorated me to get back into Objectivism and some activism and conversation.

Could you please elaborate on how her ideas influenced you?""

And here I went:

Wall of Text

I will say that the one danger of her philosophy is that it can easily be construed as narcissism. I am very arrogant by nature so I struggle with staying true to the objectivist philosophy. Perhaps the individuals you have encountered have been struggling with that as well. However her philosophy is a harsh one and some people see her as unfeeling. So that could be the case too.

In essence her philosophy gives man the freedom to be his own master - to recognize no higher authority than his mind. Additionally that mind is his most valuable tool for perceiving his rational world. The majority of the modern world holds altruism as the height of morality. Altruism is - from what I understand - sacrificing yourself or your possessions for the whole. ""You are your brother's keeper."" Now think about it. Why do most people donate to charities, volunteer to help the less fortunate, etc? Because it makes them feel good. They think they are being altruistic and through that they will be moral. This is not altruism. There is some kind of personal gain out of it for them. Thus to be truly altruistic you would actually have to do something that goes against your morality and you hate yourself for. No rational individual would choose that.

Rand recognized that man's personal happiness is his sole purpose in life. He is free to do whatever he wishes so long AS LONG AS IT DOES NOT INFRINGE ON ANOTHER MAN'S RIGHT TO DO SO. You can give away all your earthly possessions, spend all your time doing community service and that is OK!! But it is not altruism. It is for your own pleasure and the positive emotions you feel.

For as long as I can remember, I didn't understand what was immoral about keeping what I had worked hard for. Upon reading Atlas Shrugged I came to the realization that no one was entitled to anything I had earned for myself. Many people say ""Oh but you got lucky. You're blessed with intelligence. Others don't have it as good as you do."" Does their misfortune then discount everything I have worked to achieve? I am a college student over halfway through a program to get two engineering degrees. I have a steady job in my field with a company who has thus far been pleased with my performance and will likely offer me a position upon my graduation. I have no student debt (mainly scholarships and some family assistance) and I have been working my ass of since high school for those scholarships to guarantee I can achieve my happiness. Why should I feel any guilt associated with my success? You shouldn't, according to Rand.

She has summarized Objectivism with three axioms. 1. Man's life is his standard of value - everything in his life will be judged and given a worth based on whether it adds or subtracts from his quality of life. 2. Production as the moral good - you must produce in order to survive. If man is in the wild alone, no amount of self pity or begging will make him live. He must produce something for himself. Fortunately we are in a society where everyone does not have to produce everything. So in modern days you must have a skill of some value that will enable you to trade your production with others and thus survive. You cannot live on mooching and handouts from those that do produce and be considered moral. You are taking what you have not earned. 3. Reason as his only absolute - Reason is the ending judgment for all circumstances. Now she does not say you have to be right all the time. You just have to use your reasoning combined with the facts you have to the reach the best possible conclusion. If you are wrong, you take in the additional facts and adjust your argument. But you must use reason. Emotions have no bearing on decisions - they simply result from the rational mind's response to reason. (example: your dog died. You are sad. Why are you sad? Because that dog brought YOU happiness.)

Rand allowed me to fully achieve my potential and be proud of what I have done. She also made me understand that not everyone has to be Bill Gates. I'm not the best engineer in the world. I won't make the next big gadget or car. And that's ok. I will never be a millionaire and that's fine. I am producing to the best of my ability and I am satisfied with that.

I hope I made myself clear in this comment. There were many other nuances in her books that rang clear with me, but this was the vast majority of why I proudly call myself an Objectivist.

I'm only posting this because I am proud of what I wrote. I suppose that's a little self serving. :)",,False,self,t5_2qjr6,False,,,True,t3_1fb45a,http://www.reddit.com/r/Objectivism/comments/1fb45a/a_while_back_there_was_post_about_impactful_books/,

First of all, its a great game and fun world, you should play the game if you enjoy first person shooters.  Philosophically, the world of Bioshock is not objectivist, its not even capitalistic.  It's a world built on a city on the bottom of an ocean in situation of desperation  and only became worse.

While philosophy of Bioshock is very shallow, thare are many examples of why Bioshock is not objectivist to begin with:

- People who live in the city of Rapture are not allowed to leave 
- Some items are declared contraband from the outside world ( bibles, communist propoganda, materials )
- Andrew Ryan takes money for the maintenance of the city under the sea
- Experimentation on the individuals who are used to eventually create plasmids by the far seem very sketchy transactions, most of the subjects seem unwilling
- Various criminal acts are protected by Andrew Ryan for the ""good of the city""
- Andrew Ryans imprisonment of worker organizers for unions and the imprisonment of Dr. Lamb for being a commie
- Andrew Ryan's forceful takeover of Fontaine Futuristics to come into control of plasmids markets
- Many many examples of murder by Andrew Ryan

As you can tell by now, Bioshock is not a world of objectivists, it is a world ran by powerful criminals who use ""free markets"" as a guise to make their immoral activity palatable.  Don't accept any serious comparisons of Bioshock to objectivism.  That said!  Bioshock is a world that begins with a vision that is very pro-freedom, and even in its failure I think there are may examples of social conflict that are worth us objectivists considering how we would deal with:

- How do we deal with extreme business competition with each other.  There are several examples within the book of businesses running each other out of business in extreme ways.  For instance, one man has extreme control over waste disposal, and refuses to serve a man who's  trash piles up and piles up in order to destroy his business so it can be bought out by the man.

- How do we deal with sexual harassment in the work place.  Several places are described as being run by business men who are just creeps.  The freedom of Rapture has given business owners a sense of entitlement to demand things from their employers that are just really creepy.

- How do we deal with orphans.  In the book, orphans are presented as children who just wander the streets.  But where do they go in an objectivist world, and who takes care of them?

- How do we treat people who have extreme antithesis ideologies to a free government and wish to attempt a revolution or change its policies to be a communist state?

- How far do we allow contracts to go when dealing with a human life?  
In the world of bioshock, people seem capable of signing over their life to all manner of experimentation and ownership to companies.  Should this be allowed? What should happen if it occurs and people get really fucked up?

- How do we deal with a large segment of people terribly addicted to drugs?  How do we deal with people who push terribly addictive substances onto people? 

- What scenarios (if any) is the security of the state at risk enough to warrant  the denial of peoples rights, even though they may not have committed a crime?

These are the questions I got after reading about the world of Bioshock, and maybe the most important thing to derive as objectivists.  We all want freedom, I think it would help us to consider answers to questions like these to bring our desires closer to reality.",,False,self,t5_2qjr6,False,,,True,t3_18162w,http://www.reddit.com/r/Objectivism/comments/18162w/bioshock_an_overly_detailed_objectivist_criticism/,

1.  The primacy of existence does not follow from Rand's axioms.  It seems that Rand arrived at this conclusion by using her axiom of existence to say something that it doesn't say: All that which exists exists *independent of consciousness*.  This is begging the question.  In fact, I would go so far as to say that the axiom of existence (""existence exists"") is a tautology that is devoid of content.

2.  The word ""derived"" is used a lot in Objectivism, but nothing is actually derived anywhere in any rigorous sense (as in a math proof).

* Premise: We are not collectivists or a movement; we are egoists pursuing better lives, and to various degrees are influenced by Ayn Rand’s philosophy.

* Premise: While there is no meaningful collective “Objectivism,” to some degree it is beneficial to have other rational egoists flourish.  There are many reasons this might be true, but an obvious one is that it would be preferable to have people who would leave you alone be wealthy as opposed to their rivals who would support use of force against you or others.

Certain values might be difficult for many of us to attain in meatspace:

* Mining the internet for interesting news, life tips, etc.  For example, I like to share articles related to people skills-- communication and psychology.
* Moral support, life advice.  Seeking these from others might just get you altruistic pablum.
* Forming business networks with others of aligned ideology.  ""Nepotism"" with others who are not power lusters, so to speak.
* Talking about philosophy itself.  Though I am more interested in pursuing values in practice, I see value in a friendly place where beginners and others can have open discussion. However, one should take caution that ivory tower discussion does not displace real life pursuit of values.
* Recreation.  I'm not sure how much interest there is in this one, but I can see some value in playing video games with other people here -- psychological benefits of friendship, etc.  Many people like to relax by playing multiplayer games, so why not play with other people influenced by Objectivism?

I think many people often misapply the idea that compromise is evil.  I don't dispute that principle.  But what constitutes compromise?  Is voting for a libertarian candidate who is pro-life a permanent sacrifice of values?  Or ought you stay home in an election when both candidates are mixed bags even when one would be a lot worse?

I have seen a lot of Objectivists resign themselves to a brand of fatalism that reminds me a lot of the Bushido code.  They will advocate a plan of action that cedes no ground, accepting only total victory.  Even if a policy or candidate would be a marginal improvement, they might reject it wholely because some flaw in it might constitute compromise.  They launch a metaphorical Banzai charge, never taking a step backward, charging forward with bayonets affixed into the blazing line of enemy gun fire.

In war, holding a line is not victory.  Taking a step backward or trading turf for a long term advantage is not a permanent sacrifice.

Personally, I find it difficult to read when I'm not in school and with Fall semester coming soon, I figure it's a perfect time to re-read The Fountainhead (it's been nearly four years since I read it last). I thought it would be pretty cool to read as a group (with you fine people) a few chapters/sections a week and discuss what we like/dislike or anything concerning that section in a weekly thread.

I will be setting up a schedule for what to read every week soon, but if not enough people are interested, I'll just PM the few who are interested in the idea every week instead of clogging up this board.

Ideas? Comments? Has it been done before?

I'm sure this type of thing can be done with any of Ayn Rand's books, by the way. I'm only concerned with The Fountainhead because it's what got me into her literature/philosophy and it's the only one of her books I haven't bothered picking up again. If you want to organize a similar thing for any of her other books, feel free - the idea isn't uniquely mine and have fun. :)

**UPDATE**: Hello, Objectivists. I'll be working on a schedule tonight and posting it tomorrow (Sunday, the 19th) in a new thread since more than a few of you are interested. I'm currently messaging the mod to find if it'll be acceptable, but if not, I'll be starting a new sub to do this (and you can participate or not with each new book we read).

So answers to this question will be open-ended.

For me, philosophical enlightenment has been an ongoing journey with no obvious start or end date. Like most non-libertarians, I was at one point essentially a fascist, in the sense that I wanted heavy state control of various industries, intrusive regulation of personal consumption habits, militarism and overseas adventures, and state-managed education. More fundamentally, I had little to no awareness of concepts of centralized versus distributed control, spontaneous order, and the epistemological problems associated with trying to impose a world-view on the populace.

I have since come to characterize my earliest political views as ""'Just do it!' fascism,"" in reference to the attitude that, if something ""should"" be done, people should ""just do it."" This covers a broad range of topics. If we ""need"" a bridge here, then the government should just build a bridge. If a certain drug is ""bad"", then the government should just outlaw it. And of course, if people continue to use the drug anyway, then the government should just incrementally ramp up the punishment until the behavior is deterred - up to execution, if necessary.

This obviously is a profoundly naive philosophy that ignores severe concerns such as economic calculation, the subjectivity of utility, and the impracticality of enforcing laws that try to deeply alter human behavior.

I also struggled with the ridiculous sex-negativity and self-deprecation that are inculcated in us from a young age. I had a great deal of trouble with interpersonal relationships when I thought I was supposed to feel guilty for wanting to benefit from my relationships. Fortunately these old ideas are now fully purged from my system, and I'm much more successful in that department, as well as much more able to appreciate the successes I have.

It is interesting if ultimately insignificant that the closest popular depiction I have ever seen to my younger self comes in the form of Anakin Skywalker, in the ""I don't think the system works"" scene.

&gt; A: I don’t think the system works.

&gt; P: How would you have it work?

&gt; A: We need a system where the politicians sit down and discuss the problem… agree what’s in the best interest of all people… and then do it.

&gt; P: That’s exactly what we do. The trouble is that people don’t always agree.

&gt; A: Well, then they should be made to.

&gt; P: By whom? Who’s going to make them?

&gt; A: I don’t know. Someone.

&gt; P: You?

&gt; A: Of course not me.

&gt; P: But someone.

&gt; A: Someone wise.

&gt; P: Sounds an awful lot like a dictatorship to me.

No private action is censorship. No private individual or agency can silence a man or suppress a publication; only the government can do so. The freedom of speech of private individuals includes the right not to agree, not to listen and not to finance one’s own antagonists.

For years, the collectivists have been propagating the notion that a private individual’s refusal to finance an opponent is a violation of the opponent’s right of free speech and an act of “censorship.”

It is “censorship,” they claim, if a newspaper refuses to employ or publish writers whose ideas are diametrically opposed to its policy.

It is “censorship,” they claim, if businessmen refuse to advertise in a magazine that denounces, insults and smears them . . . .

This collectivist notion means that the ability to provide the material tools for the expression of ideas deprives a man of the right to hold any ideas. It means that a publisher has to publish books he considers worthless, false or evil—that a TV sponsor has to finance commentators who choose to affront his convictions—that the owner of a newspaper must turn his editorial pages over to any young hooligan who clamors for the enslavement of the press.

1351297731.0,15,self.Objectivism,125hvl,"What are common misconceptions about Objectivism that you think could be easily cleared up with sensible, reasoned, evidence-based discussion?",20,5,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/Objectivism/comments/125hvl/what_are_common_misconceptions_about_objectivism/,"My answer: Oooh, where to even begin? :-)  I would say one huge misconception about Rand/Oism is the narrow-minded focus on politics and economics, and to a lesser extent on her ethics (and with a narrow focus on a usually-misunderstood egoism/altruism distinction), when in fact Rand was emphatic that these were derivatives resting on a base of reason as a primary, reason being defined (at length, in ITOE and OPAR) in terms of a quite-neo-Aristotelian focus on rigorous *integration* of one's concepts/knowledge, of keeping the *context* of one's ideas on hand, and respecting the *hierarchy* of concepts/knowledge.

From the usual mass-media presentations, you'd never know that the first half of *OPAR* even exists, that the second half of the 2nd edition of *ITOE* exists, that any such thing as a course called *Understanding Objectivism* (presented by her best student) exists, etc.  And yet, if you actually ever interact with long-time students of Objectivism, the cognitive-method things are more or less all they ever talk about; at the minimum, they're always implicit in or intertwined with whatever issues they discuss.  The very understanding of such concepts as ""egoism,"" ""individualism"" and ""capitalism"" is deeply conditioned by these epistemic principles.  Whats more, Rand pointed out explicitly in publication that she was *primarily* an advocate of reason and that the defense of reason was the essence of Objectivism and the primary goal of her work (the other stated goal of her writing, in an essay by that title, being the portrayal of an ideal man, with all other considerations subsumed under this principle).

I suppose the extent to which one could readily clear up the misconceptions about her philosophy involved here depends on factors such as (1) ability to present correctives to them cogently and effectively (not easy to do); (2) the willingness of the critic to hear out the corrective responses in the spirit of intellectual curiosity (not easy to come by, quite unfortunately); (3) the ability of the critic to grasp higher-level philosophical abstractions going beyond politics (also not easy to come by, quite unfortunately).  There may be other factors, but those are some big ones.

I think that without exposure to and absorption of *Understanding Objectivism*, most ""understandings"" and criticisms of Objectivism are next to useless.  It used to be that you had to shell out hundreds of dollars for a hard-to-reference audio lecture course to gain access to this material; it's not on the level of the amount of time and resources one has to expend to understand Scientology as Tom Cruise understands it, but still represented a barrier.  With the very affordable book-form publication of *Understanding Objectivism* now out there, I don't see much if any excuse going forward for ignorant commentary on Objectivism.  As it is, hostile commentators have quite a bit of catching up to do given years of intellectual negligence irrespective of this course's publication status; this material in particular just adds rather tremendously to their homework load.

I don't see competent, well-informed criticism of Objectivism happening for at least several years and by that point I think attempts to carry it out will end up in frustration that, in methodology, Objectivism serves as its own best defender given the aforementioned emphasis on integration, context, and hierarchy.  (You can't attack the method without implicitly invoking it - not like any of this is news to the long-time Oists who've spent years immersed in this stuff.  Scholars like Sciabarra will tell you the very same thing.)  I consider yours truly to be perhaps the only person qualified to carry out a decent criticism ""from the inside-out"" as it were, but all that such criticism would really amount to is, ""Rand made mistake X by not taking into account the full context/hierarchy/integration of knowledge as she had prescribed.""  As I hinted at above, I think Aristotle himself would otherwise be quite pleased with the method.  If that's the best that could be done - and I've become convinced after a decade-plus of critically studying this stuff that it is - then the Rand-haters are are pretty much fucked long-run (unless they jump on the team and come on in for the big win [h/t Stanley Kubrick - integration of knowledge, see]).

So, um, yeah.  How 'bout you?

**TL;DR:** Philosophy can't be done in abbreviated soundbites, sorry.  That's for cognitive sissies on other subreddits.  Instead, why don't you jump on the team and come on in for the big win?

EDIT: It's worth mentioning how enjoyable it is to hear Rand in her Russian accent on recorded radio interviews and whatnot occasionally using the phrase, ""misrepresentations, distortions, and outright smears"" to describe the tactics of a great many of her opponents.  There's even one where she uses the beautiful turn of phrase: ""Those who make an effort *not* to understand me, are no concern of mine.""  My preferred phrasing has been to refer to those who go out of their way to miss the point. :-)  Anyway, the distortions, misrepresentations, and outright smears have been going on ever since Rand's day when she could experience them first-hand (and regard them with the contempt they deserved) - most especially in the wake of *Atlas,* since *The Fountainhead* was quite popular in the years following its publication and didn't generate nearly the level of hysterical hate that *Atlas* did.  What's ~~most impressive~~ fucking ridiculous is how, 50 years later, the haters still haven't gotten around to getting any closer to getting it right about her ideas than they did back then; if anything, they've **regressed** in that regard.  50 fucking years and a growing secondary literature available for consulting and still their criticisms are ignorant and useless.  Now that's just pathetic, folks.  Perhaps it has to do with many readers having read only the novels and being too philosophically inept to grasp the message contained therein, much less to have an interest in consulting the non-fiction literature.  So OPAR never once so much as crossed their field of vision; never once have they heard the terms ""context,"" ""hierarchy"" and ""integration"" in connection with Rand even though she regarded these concepts as fundamental to her intellectual worldview - to her definition of *reason* and of *objectivity*.  However, an ""I've got mine so fuck you"" message that wasn't even there somehow managed to get burned right into their brains as Rand's primary message.  It's all too predictable by now, and the philosophical profession has been of little help in steering these young skulls full of mush in a more cognitively-productive direction.  An F grade all-around.

Now, I'm kind of new to Objectivism, and I'm still reading through Atlas Shrugged.

According to their very homepage, RationalWiki's goals are:

* Analyzing and refuting **pseudoscience** and the **anti-science** movement.
* Documenting the full range of crank ideas.
* Explorations of **authoritarianism** and **fundamentalism**.
* Analysis and criticism of how these subjects are handled in the media.

Forgive me if I'm wrong, but aren't some of those goals those overlapping with Objectivism's?

I find it sickening  that [diatribe](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Objectivism) such as this is is published on said website:
&gt; Objectivism is a **""**philosophy**""** formulated by novelist Ayn Rand. It has various tenets, but is best known for defining self-interest as a moral virtue. As one might imagine, Objectivism is very popular amongst those who hold a me-first view of the world. It lets them say, **""Hey, I'm not being a selfish jerk, I'm following a philosophy!""**

They also repeatedly parrot [common misconceptions](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Objectivism#Ethics)
&gt; Objectivism holds, basically, that everyone should live by their own effort, **neither accepting gifts from others nor giving them**, as both actions are considered moral weaknesses. It attempts to apply the principles of laissez-faire to right and wrong. For Rand the individual’s life has supreme value and self-interest determines ethics. Therefore, Objectivism holds that all forms of altruism are irrational and immoral, **even if they are done voluntarily**

This both *conflates generosity and altruism*, and is in direct contradiction with many of Rand's writings, such as  the relationship between Dagny and Henry Rearden's, and is further **refuted by Rand in her own words**: [(link)](http://www.aynrandanswers.com/2012/09/did-ayn-rand-oppose-helping-others-did.html)
&gt; The fact that a man has no claim on others (i.e., that it is not their moral duty to help him and that he cannot demand their help as his right) does not preclude or prohibit good will among men and does not make it immoral to offer or to accept voluntary, non-sacrificial assistance.

Now, I found that quote using google in less than 10 seconds, but I do not pretend to be an expert on Objectivism.  What's worse is that the article above *isn't even scratching the surface on their strawmen and other fallacies.** They should be ashamed to write garbage like this and call it ""rationality"".

Is anyone here willing to help me correct the atrocity that is that article? They made it open to the public, so I hope they're ready for actual discussion. 

There's nothing I loathe more than those who sell hate and slander under the guise of rationality and noble unbiased analysis.

Today (Sunday, August 19th) will begin our start up of the Rand Book Club to begin reading The Fountainhead as a group, with any and all redditors welcome to join us. This thread is merely to initiate and inform. We will be discussing Part I (Peter Keating) within the next 4 weeks here on r/Objectivism before moving the threads to r/RandBookClub.

The schedule will be as follows:

* Sunday, August 26th: Discussion of Chapters 1-5
* Sunday, September 2: Discussion of Chapters 6-11
* Sunday, September 9: Discussion of Chapters 12-15

I divided Part I evenly among pages (just about) but once we get rolling on r/RandBookClub the chapters we read will revolve more around plot than pages being read. **Sunday, September 16** we will begin reading Part II on r/RandBookClub, so please subscribe (link on the sidebar) before then (details about what chapters to read by then to be given at a later date).

I created r/RandBookClub to have seasonal readings throughout the year of Ayn Rand's books (fiction or non-fiction). It will be ready by the time it becomes active in a month. I will be needing help moderating it if it becomes too big and, if you're interested, let me know. Group discussions will always be had before choosing which book to read next and for what reasons.

The structure of the threads will be both interactive and fun. I have a few ideas, but if you'd like to implement something each week you've seen done elsewhere, please let me know.

Ideas? Comments? Questions? Ask away. Until next week: happy reading!",,False,self,t5_2qjr6,False,,,True,t3_yhjay,http://www.reddit.com/r/Objectivism/comments/yhjay/rand_book_club_the_fountainhead/,

In my personal life, I have never come across another person who was an Objectivist. I found people who have read her and find few of her ideas as ""not crazy"" or people who just hate anything relating to Objectivism. Luckily, I have been able to find libertarians that provide wonderful discussions. However, I never found those discussions sufficient; especially if I had questions about Objectivism. 

Now I have friends but they are either apathetic toward politics/philosophy or they have various degrees of statism/mysticism. I tend to avoid discussions with them because I am the odd man out. I have been in situations where it's me vs all my friends (or an entire class including teacher). I tend to respond only when asked (mainly because they are sometime curious as to what Objectivism believes). 

My fiancee, was a socialist but ultimately became a libertarian or more specifcally ""an Objectivist who hates Ayn Rand, Peikoff and ARI"". It's great to explain things to her but I sometime wish I had  a person who can teach me about Objectivism. 

Lastly, I am also quite wary of both ARI and the Atlas Society. I don't agree with many view points ARI puts forth and I'm cautious of being associated with those the Atlas Society might welcome. Therefore, I don't muhc outlets other than the works of Ayn Rand herself, some stuff by other Objectivist and the occasional libertarian. 

I do apologize for the long post but I joined Reddit simply to ask this question (yes, this is my first post) and to see what others think. I will end it with a paraphrase from Peikoff that I read to myself on occasion:

""When he develops his first values and conscious convictions, particularly as he approaches adolescence, he feels an intense desire to share them with a friend who would understand him; if frustrated, he feels an acute sense of loneliness. Loneliness is specifically the experience of this type of child—or adult; it is the experience of those who have something to offer. The emotion that drives conformists to “belong,” is not loneliness, but fear.""

Edit: Thank you all for the support. I'll do my best to find more like minded individuals. Even if they might not be Objectivist, peoples who tend to have similar views usually are more welcoming for civil discussion (in my experience).

I understand the idea of having a drink in celebration, or perhaps a glass of wine over dinner, but what of excessive use?  If the person wants to be extremely drunk, is that morally acceptable?  Does the loss of rational capability that comes with large proportions of alcohol demand that all Objectivists avoid over-indulgence altogether?

To anyone who tries to take his machine away from him, he responds the only way he can: with force.

What book and what character am I describing?

The answer: *Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Seas* and Captain Nemo respectively.

Captain Nemo reminded me of Ragnar, except that while the latter does not sink military ships, the former does. Also, very surprising, Captain Nemo, unlike many stereotypical sea-captains, is an individualist: I assumed that if a sea-captain gave an order which resulted in the death of his men, he would shrug it off with an ""The ends justify the means/the good of the ship supersedes the good of the individual."" Captain Nemo is not like this at all. Every time one of his crew members gets hurt or dies, he bursts into tears.

(More details inside)",16,1,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/Objectivism/comments/x1p4n/hey_robjectivism_can_you_recommend_positive_and/,"First of all, thanks for peeking in here; I'll try to be descriptive yet succinct.  My boyfriend (for lack of a more accurate term; let's call him Chris) is an active duty soldier, and he's having a really hard time staying motivated in a horribly depressing environment.  I myself am a former soldier, he and I have/had the same job in the military and went to the same school, so I know exactly what he's talking about.  

First of all, the Army ethics are heavily based on altruism and self-sacrifice; already not off to a good start.  Many, many service-members embrace either this system of ethics or subjective hedonism, and the particular demographic where Chris works is heavily saturated with such people.  Incompetence and laziness are the standard, and rather than being praised or rewarded, hard workers are instead singled out for extra duty; the work that doesn't get done by the lazy people is simply dumped on the hard workers.  Chris works with 40-50 other soldiers and has no friends among them, and only a few people whose companionship he can even tolerate.  He's 3,000 miles away from friends and family and understandably having a really hard time staying motivated and happy.  As bad as it is, it would be manageable if he could come home every so often, but he's been in for over a year and his superiors simply refuse to let him take leave.  Granted, only in life-or-death emergencies are they *required* to let him go home, but some other (more highly trained) soldiers in his area go home regularly, so it's clearly not a staffing issue.  

Chris doesn't label himself an Objectivist, but his value system is pretty close except for a few differences.  He believes in pride as a virtue, rationality above all else, independence, the sanctity of personal property and responsibility for one's actions, good or bad.  He has what I would call a fundamental understanding of the Objectivist ethics, and has read several things *about* Rand, but nothing *by* her.  One discrepancy that, I think, is contributing to his persistent state of bummed-outness, is his reluctance to embrace the idea of a benevolent universe.  He believes that mankind as a whole is capable of remarkable things and that there are noble people who live up to that potential and should be revered, but the vast majority are weak, stupid and petty.  I don't know that I would necessarily say ""vast majority,"" but I understand why he feels that way and I can't entirely blame him.  

Now for my actual question: since he can't come home and I can't visit him, at least not in the near future, I'm planning to send him a care package to hopefully perk him up a little, at least short term.  Besides fun stuff, I also want to include some books or other media that might inspire him to tweak his thinking just enough that he can weather the next 3 years without being miserable.  I survived a very similar situation, and it was awful, but by constantly practicing and reinforcing a rationally egoistic mindset, I got through it without too much negative energy.  Can anyone recommend reading material, movies, games, or anything else that might help him out here?  It doesn't have to Objectivist literature, as long as it reinforces a positive, rational mindset that might be helpful.  Also, it would be preferable, but not mandatory, if they're relatively short-ish and/or easy to read, simply because he has very little free time; it would take him years to plow through AS at 30 minutes a night.  I was thinking of sending my copies of The Virtue of Selfishness and Anthem, and he already owns and is reading the Sword of Truth series, which is a fantasy fiction series by an Objectivist author strongly focused on Rand's ethics.  

Any other suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks for reading, even if you don't have any ideas.  If you need more info or something clarified, ask away.

---

What's the inverse of ""fake but accurate""? ""True but false""!

""Fake but accurate""—the New York Times description of the Rathergate memo in 2004—was the mainstream media's attempt to admit that a document supporting their preferred story line was a forgery, while still clinging to the story. ""True but false"" is the Washington Post's attempt to admit that a fact which undermines their preferred story line is true, while still clinging to the story.

Notice a pattern? The pre-determined story line comes first, and the facts are explained away in order to preserve it.

""True but false"" comes to us by way of the Washington Post's ""fact-checker"" Glenn Kessler, as his [answer](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/post/are-obamas-job-policies-hurting-women/2012/04/09/gIQAGz3q6S_blog.html#) to the Republican National Committee's claim that under Obama, unemployment has disproportionately affected women.

Normally, you'd think the press would run with this story. You know the old joke: ""World to End Tomorrow; Women and Minorities Hardest Hit."" But not when a Democratic president is in office, which explains why you haven't heard much about this recession's devastating level of unemployment among blacks. So unemployment among women had to be explained away, too.

The Republicans had given the press a full set of numbers to back up their claim, and Kessler had to admit that ""We cannot fault the RNC's math, as the numbers add up."" He then quotes a bunch of left-leaning sources making excuses about how presidents aren't really responsible for the economy, and how it's just a matter of unfortunate timing, and so on. So he concludes, absurdly, by calling the RNC's claim ""true but false.""

The Hot Air blog pokes some well-deserved fun at this and also provides what seems to me to be an actual, realistic explanation for the underlying facts. ""Women far outnumber men on state and local government payrolls (especially in public schools), which were propped up by Obama's stimulus money.... That money was spent.... The result was unemployment for hundreds of thousands of women starting in 2010.""

But the most fascinating part about this is the basic epistemological issue. The mainstream media has set up a raft of these so-called ""fact-checking"" columns, but the people who run them don't know what a fact is, as opposed to an interpretation or analysis of the facts. So they acknowledge that the actual facts—the concretes that can be directly observed and measured—are true, but then they override the facts because they don't like the interpretation that the facts imply.

One suspects that confusing the difference between fact and interpretation is precisely the point. That's the old racket of the mainstream media. They set themselves up as the exclusive arbiters of fact; when Walter Cronkite said, ""and that's the way it is,"" that was the way it was. Then they abuse that power to promote their ideology by presenting it as a simple, uncontroversial ""fact,"" saving them from the tedious job of arguing for it.

But the racket doesn't work any more, because they no longer have a media monopoly. And the more they use phrases like ""true but false,"" the faster their control over the media disintegrates.

1326703597.0,13,self.Objectivism,oj3vh,Ayn Rand refutes Ayn Rand's theory of government,29,16,84,http://www.reddit.com/r/Objectivism/comments/oj3vh/ayn_rand_refutes_ayn_rands_theory_of_government/,"What is the nature and purpose of government?

&gt;The only proper purpose of a government is to protect man’s rights, which means: to protect him from physical violence. A proper government is only a policeman, acting as an agent of man’s self-defense, and, as such, may resort to force only against those who start the use of force. The only proper functions of a government are: the police, to protect you from criminals; the army, to protect you from foreign invaders; and the courts, to protect your property and contracts from breach or fraud by others, to settle disputes by rational rules, according to objective law.

-
&gt;A government is an institution that holds the exclusive power to enforce certain rules of social conduct in a given geographical area.

-
&gt;The fundamental difference between private action and governmental action—a difference thoroughly ignored and evaded today—lies in the fact that a government holds a monopoly on the legal use of physical force

Whence does the government derive its right to this monopoly?

&gt;The government of [a free] nation is not the ruler, but the servant or *agent* of its citizens and has no rights other than the rights *delegated* to it by the citizens for a specific, delimited task (the task of protecting them from physical force, derived from their right of self-defense).

-
&gt;The source of the government’s authority is “the consent of the governed.” This means that the government is not the ruler, but the servant or agent of the citizens; it means that the government as such has no rights except the rights delegated to it by the citizens for a specific purpose.

Oh okay; a government gets its rights by individuals delegating to it their right to self-defense. That makes sense. Is there any condition under which an individual would not delegate that right to the government?

&gt;The citizens of a free nation may disagree about the specific legal procedures or *methods* of implementing their rights (which is a complex problem, the province of political science and of the philosophy of law)

So if an individual disagrees with his government's methods of implementing his rights, he can choose to delegate his rights to another such entity, say... a competing government?

&gt;The common denominator of such [advocates of “competing governments”] is the desire to escape from objectivity (objectivity requires a very long conceptual chain and very abstract principles), to act on whim, and to deal with men rather than with ideas—i.e., with the men of their own gang bound by the same concretes.

Oh, I guess not. Where does this objectivity come from?

&gt;The retaliatory use of force requires *objective* rules of evidence to establish that a crime has been committed and to *prove* who committed it, as well as *objective* rules to define punishments and enforcement procedures. Men who attempt to prosecute crimes, without such rules, are a lynch mob. If a society left the retaliatory use of force in the hands of individual citizens, it would degenerate into mob rule, lynch law and an endless series of bloody private feuds or vendettas.

So objectivity in law comes from... the synergy of individuals collected under a government? Is that what I'm hearing? Wait a second...

&gt;Any group or ""collective,"" large or small, is only a number of individuals. A group can have no rights other than the rights of its individual members. In a free society, the ""rights"" of any group are derived from the rights of its members through their voluntary, individual choice and *contractual* agreement, and are merely the application of these individual rights to a specific undertaking.

-
&gt;A group, as such, has no rights. A man can neither acquire new rights by joining a group nor lose the rights which he does possess. The principle of individual rights is the only moral base of all groups or associations.

&gt;Any group that does not recognize this principle is not an association, but a gang or a mob.

-
&gt;Just as the notion that ""Anything I do is right because *I* chose to do it,"" is not a moral principle, but a negation of morality - so the notion that ""Anything society does is right because *society* chose to do it,"" is not a moral principle, but a negation of moral principles and the banishment of morality from social issues.

-
&gt;The source of the government’s authority is “the consent of the governed.” This means that the government is not the ruler, but the servant or agent of the citizens; it means that the government as such has no rights except the rights delegated to it by the citizens for a specific purpose.

-
&gt;Under a proper social system, a private individual is legally free to take any action he pleases (so long as he does not violate the rights of others)

So the individual right to self-defense is only delegated to government on a voluntary basis, and in doing so the individual cannot lose this right?

&gt;The use of physical force—even its retaliatory use—cannot be left at the discretion of individual citizens.

Okay, you lost me there, Ayn.

I decided to read some critiques of the philosophy in order to have a well rounded view. There was only one argument (from James Rachels) that stuck with me and it went along these lines:

There is a family of moral views that involve dividing people into groups and saying one group's interests count for more than the others'. Racism is an example of this: people are split into groups based on race and one race is treated better than another. However, this view cannot be defended because we can only justify treating people differently if there is a factual difference between them that is relevant to justifying the difference in treatment. A racist cannot point to any differences between, for example, a white person and a black person that would justify treating them differently. This makes racism an arbitrary doctrine.

You may be wondering what this has to do with Objectivism. Well, Objectivism advocates that we divide the world into two categories - ourselves and all the rest. But what is the difference between myself and others that justifies placing myself in a different category? The argument then, is this (quoted from James Rachels' A Critique of Ethical Egoism):

""1. Any moral doctrine that assigns greater importance to the interests of one group than to those of another is unacceptably arbitrary unless there is some difference between the members of groups that justifies treating them differently.
2. Ethical Egoism [Objectivism] would have each person assign greater importance to his or her own interests than to the interests of others. *But there is no general difference between oneself and others, to which each person can appeal, that justifies this difference in treatment*
3. Therefore, Ethical Egoism [Objectivism] is unacceptably arbitrary.""

I have trouble refuting this argument. It seems pretty tight. I would like to believe Objectivism is the right philosophy but as long as I am unable to refute this argument I can't. If any of you can offer some insight please do.

I've been reading  Shrugged for a little while now (currently on chapter 7, ""This is John Galt Speaking""), and I thought I'd take a break from all that reading by giving the movie adaptation of part 1 for a try. I didn't think it was going to be GOOD or anything. I figured it would have to be rushed, and hence character development and the overall epicness of the plot would inevitably suffer.

As expected, the acting was sub-par at best, the plot seemed hastily rushed, and half of Part 1 seemed missing. But, it was interesting putting real faces on some of these characters.

Reality exists as an objective absolute—facts are facts, independent of man’s feelings, wishes, hopes or fears.

2. Reason (the faculty which identifies and integrates the material provided by man’s senses) is man’s only means of perceiving reality, his only source of knowledge, his only guide to action, and his basic means of survival.

3. Man—every man—is an end in himself, not the means to the ends of others. He must exist for his own sake, neither sacrificing himself to others nor sacrificing others to himself. The pursuit of his own rational self-interest and of his own happiness is the highest moral purpose of his life.

4. The ideal political-economic system is laissez-faire capitalism. It is a system where men deal with one another, not as victims and executioners, nor as masters and slaves, but as traders, by free, voluntary exchange to mutual benefit. It is a system where no man may obtain any values from others by resorting to physical force, and no man may initiate the use of physical force against others. The government acts only as a policeman that protects man’s rights; it uses physical force only in retaliation and only against those who initiate its use, such as criminals or foreign invaders. In a system of full capitalism, there should be (but, historically, has not yet been) a complete separation of state and economics, in the same way and for the same reasons as the separation of state and church.

John Allison just confirmed my worst fears about his assumption of leadership at Cato. In this statement to Cato employees, he distanced himself from his remarks at the OCON Q&amp;A and said: ""In fact, now that I have a deeper understanding about Cato, I believe almost all the name calling between libertarians and objectivists is irrational. I have come to appreciate that all objectivists are libertarians, but not all libertarians are objectivists. I respect this distinction, (although I consider anarchy to be dangerous)."" 

That's what I expected John Allison to do, but I didn't expect him to be quite so explicit about it, nor for him to do it quite so soon. The objections to his comments at OCON from libertarians were gaining too much traction, it seems.

I must say, the bit about ""name-calling"" is just rich -- as if Objectivist critics of libertarianism, including Ayn Rand herself -- never had any valid objections to the libertarian movement whatsoever. The libertarian movement, as a matter of its fundamental principle, embraces people of any philosophic persuasion whatsoever -- including fundamentalist Christians, smash-the-state anarchists, opponents of intellectual property, abortion opponents, pedophilia advocates, altruistic utilitarians, blame-America-first pacifists, neoconservatives, Hayekians, welfare statists, and more. Objectivism, in contrast, has some very definite views about the basis and nature of liberty. That's why Objectivism is not -- and never will be -- compatible with libertarianism.

So if you thought that JA would move the libertarian movement (and Cato) in an Objectivist direction, he's told you otherwise now. His goal all along has been to move the Objectivist movement in a libertarian direction. (That's in his statement: ""Having run a large organization with many different constituencies, I am a 'big tent' thinker. I have long encouraged ARI to work with Cato."") By all accounts, he's succeeded. 

I am an Objectivist. I am not a libertarian, and I do not and would never wish to identify myself with the philosophical relativism at the core of the libertarian movement. I'm friendly with many libertarians, of course, and I work with better libertarians on an ad hoc basis -- same as with liberals, conservatives, and Objectivists. Still, dammit, I am not a libertarian.

The same, however, cannot be said of the Ayn Rand Institute, given John Allison's seat on the board and other close ties, as well as their support of his position at Cato. From now on, they richly deserve to be referred to as ""the libertarian Ayn Rand Institute.""

We didn't watch that much TV and what we did watch was a waste of time (like local news).  A major factor in our decision, and one of the things that has made it a good move for us, is the fact that I can download almost anything we ""need"" to watch, and stream it to one of our GoogleTV boxes.  

It's a really slick system that now, after many attempts throughout the years, almost never fails.  We are very rarely left wanting when it comes to digital media - even though we rarely pay for it.  I have a subscription to Netflix and Amazon Prime, but the bulk of our entertainment is ""free"".

I'm relatively new to objectivism (1.5 years), but have only recently attained enough understanding to start applying its principles to my own life.

I realized early this morning that the way I attain and consume most digital media goes against my belief that producers deserve to be paid for their work and that I'm morally obligated to trade, in kind, for the consumption of their product.

I can't, in good conscience, continue these practices.  It makes me a leach, which conflicts with my own standards.

My only question, and it may not warrant an answer, is - am I wrong?  Is there a way for me to continue to attain and consume the content that I'm used to enjoying in the same way, but also giving back to the producers of the shows or movies that I watch?  I will not subscribe to cable again.  I'd rather watch what I can on paid services like Hulu, Netflix, or Amazon Prime.

Edit: Contrary to some of the wording I used in the original post, I'm not actually looking for a way to justify what I'm doing.  One might exist, but I'm not actively searching for it.  More or less I wanted to get your take on it.

Edit 2: I also want to express the amount of pride I have in the fact that I made this rational decision and took action accordingly.

My gripe with the internet generation's existential crisis.,19,4,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/Objectivism/comments/oy23j/when_did_what_do_you_think_become_more_important/,"I love the internet. I love the freedom and spread of information it's brought us, it's unbelievable. However, I think with the spread and accessibility to sharing information, people, especially younger people,  are losing focus on the importance of personal pride.

It's mentally unhealthy to live life for the purpose to have others judge you for what you do.Twitter, facebook, opinion blogs, almost all social media revolves around people doing things for the purpose to share them with others, for judgement or some sense of pride. While sharing information is integral to advancing our culture, sharing for the purpose to achieve recognition is more demanding on society's sense of morals than most would like to think.

Society is showing once again how it is sabotaging the idea of the importance of one's sense of self pride and establishment in this world. Most people seem to think they need to blog, tweet, and facebook update their way through life to make sure they don't just up and disappear. Now more than ever, people would say, you have to share your experience with others, for the benefit of all, to be fully integrated in society.

I draw, a lot, professionally and for a hobby. I choose not to share it online for the same reason I don't have any social media accounts (not including Reddit, reason being anonymity and awesomeness), because I don't give a flying fuck what other people think of every doodle I make.

I think the obvious point is that Ayn Rand herself preached [no *initiation* of force](http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/physical_force.html) on man as a main tenant of the philosophy. What happened to the natives was indeed force.

Ayn Rand had **her** views and they were based on Objectivism while we have **ours** and they too are based on Objectivism. By simply applying strict Objectivist philosophy to a situation (reasoning) you can see that what happened was wrong and I am willing to accept that Ayn Rand was not a perfect person. Who is? But the fact that she came closer than most and that we strive every day to get there is what counts.

I guess what I'm saying is you shouldn't let the imperfections of a person ruin the wisdom that they shared. Truth is truth no matter whose mouth it escapes.

And if I understand correctly, this ""I ought to live"" is the basis on which objectivism proves all other normative (moral) claims.

I've been thinking about it and it doesn't really seem like you can infer very much from the fact that someone chooses to live. For example, I could build an intelligent robot that only valued killing human babies. It would choose to live since living is required to kill babies. But it wouldn't necessarily logically deduce any objectivists values like (for example) respect for private property. 

To be clear: the problem *isn't* that the robot is illogical: no matter how smart it is it'll still look inside it's robot heart and find the only thing it wants to do is kill babies. Indeed, it's unclear what intelligence could possibly be used for other than devising better ways to kill more babies.

Obviously this is a contrived example, but I think it makes the point clear: the fact that something/someone chooses to live doesn't really imply much of anything about what else it values. This leads me to suspect that objectivism makes some other assumptions to reach its conclusions. Am I correct? Or is there something I'm missing?",,False,self,t5_2qjr6,False,,,True,t3_1iocdw,http://www.reddit.com/r/Objectivism/comments/1iocdw/question_from_a_nonobjectivist_the_isought_problem/,
1373938809.0,12,self.Objectivism,1idrwt,"Have you ever met somebody who is an Objectivist, but has never even heard of Ayn Rand? Tell the story!",14,2,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/Objectivism/comments/1idrwt/have_you_ever_met_somebody_who_is_an_objectivist/,"**I'm going to go ahead and add the disclaimer here: You don't have to have read Rand to be an Objectivist. Many rational people come upon this philosophy independently through induction.**

If you've met one, tell us the story and the ensuing conversation. I'll start with mine:

I was 20, in my second semester of my third year of college, and had an 8am Gov't class over The Constitution, Locke, Mill, Tocqueville, Federalist Papers, etc. On every day of class, the prof has 3 different students introduce themselves, the general format being to state your name, major, something interesting about you, and something that interests you. I fully expect to not hear one interesting thing. I expect to hear ""last summer me and the bros went to South Padre and got in backstage at a 311 concert"" or ""I'm interested in music.""

And that's exactly what I heard. One day, the prof calls on me, and I try to say something true, but not too revealing, so as to not alienate myself like I inevitably do. I say something like, ""There's not really anything that you'd find interesting about me--I enjoy reading textbooks and I only listen to classical/baroque/romantic music."" Nobody says anything; the prof politely acknowledges having heard me and moves on.

I breathe a sigh of relief at having avoided standing out when the prof calls on somebody else, a pale girl no taller than 5'4"" wearing a collared white dress-shirt and black slacks. Her petite frame would make you think she is a 16 year old and her face held a kind of educated innocence. It was obvious that she was aware of things. But when I see that look in somebody's eyes I am always wary of the likelihood of being disappointed--many people have an effective facade that covers up some large, tragic, character flaw/s. She instantly replies to the professor, her tone expressing honest confidence, and her gaze never unlocking with the prof's. I could tell just by the two sentences she spoke that she wasn't some princess who depends on her beauty to get what she wants (although she easily could have).

Her answer was something along the lines of, ""Last year I climbed Mt. Kilimanjaro. My main interest is knowledge.""

To understate it, my interest was piqued--but I couldn't think of a common basis by which to start a conversation with her. What was I going to say, ""I like knowledge too?"" 

So weeks go on, and we are reading Locke's second treatise. The professor makes a political joke about it at the beginning of class, and it goes way over everybody's heads. Well, everybody except me and this girl. We both laugh as soon as the joke processes, and we both look over at the other. Our eyes locked. At this moment I feel the single most profound emotion that has ever been caused by another person--and I don't identify it. All I know is that now we have our common basis and I am going to use it to its fullest advantage. 

After class I wait after and we talk. She tells me that her personal philosophy is based on the primacy of truth, and that she will do anything and everything she can to pursue the truth in life and in herself, even if it hurts. I am always skeptical of how people use the word ""truth,"" but she explained how she defined truth and the process she uses to reach it, and mentioned a preference for the ""hard truth."" Exactly my kind of 'truth.'

So we begin talking regularly, about subjects ranging from the personal, to the literary, to the empirical, and even to the metaphysical; we trade books (she first gave me Dorian Grey and I gave her the Fountainhead); we exchange writings; but overall we just wanted to be in each other's company--to bounce thoughts off of, to discuss that which nobody else wants to discuss, and most importantly: **to help each other grow as people**. This goal was made explicit from the beginning; we realized our degrees of awareness could be used to constructively critique everything about each other (all except aesthetics). All this continues for about 8 months until we pass a certain point when it is readily apparent to both of us that we are extremely in love with each other.

I have several other stories (of similar length) of meeting de facto Objectivists, but this one, I think, takes the cake.

1371237269.0,12,self.Objectivism,1gcucs,"How ""philosophy"" works in the academy",15,3,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Objectivism/comments/1gcucs/how_philosophy_works_in_the_academy/,"(also [posted](http://www.reddit.com/r/AcademicPhilosophy/comments/1gcwjs/the_academy_and_ayn_rand_originally_posted_in/) in the lion's den, /r/AcademicPhilosophy :-) )

If one reads through the comments [here](http://leiterreports.typepad.com/blog/2012/08/philosophical-critiques-of-rand.html) at Brian Leiter's blog, one should keep this dictum in mind: Among those who are *seriously knowledgeable* about Objectivism, its merits are so strong as to be, in effect, irrefutable; it's the best modern heir to the Aristotelian tradition yet to be formulated in print.  If others with not-so-great understanding dismiss Rand, that of course is not proof at all that someone who seriously understands Rand is going to dismiss it.

But what's really egregious about this set of comments is that Tara Smith (*Ayn Rand's Normative Ethics*) receives no mention, Allan Gotthelf (The Ayn Rand Society's ""studies"" series) receives no mention, The Ayn Rand Society itself (which features leading Aristotelian scholars Gotthelf, Miller, and Lennox, as well as prominent Nietzsche scholar, Lester Hunt, on its steering committee) receives no mention, Peikoff receives one tangential mention (so no mention of his systematic treatment of Rand in OPAR, or of his *Understanding Objectivism*, which was published months prior to this blog discussion), only one single brief mention of Chris Matthew Sciabarra's monumental *Ayn Rand: The Russian Radical* (after Peikoff, Binswanger and Gotthelf, Sciabarra has an entirely legitimate claim to being a leading Ayn Rand scholar; one need only look at the bibliography of his work and read his arguments carefully to come to this realization), and while there are numerous mentions of Nozick's ""On the Randian Argument,"" there is no mention of Rasmussen and Den Uyl's later rebuttal in the same journal, ""Nozick on the Randian Argument.""

All of these people or sources are either ignored or unknown by the critics/dismissers of Rand in the comments section.  Roderick Long (co-editor with Sciabarra of the *Journal of Ayn Rand Studies* and co-author of the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy entry on Rand) showed up in the comments section to ask those bashing the SEP entry to explain themselves, only to be ignored.

This is not philosophy; this is a farce.  Ignorance parading as knowledge; one-sidedness parading as fairness and balance.  It's ridiculous.

If people seriously wanted to know about and understand Rand as those who've seriously studied her ideas understand them, then they cannot afford to be ignorant of the scholarship from Peikoff, Gotthelf, Smith, Sciabarra, or the ""Dougs.""

What this travesty of a blog entry and comments section indicates, is that ""philosophy"" in the academy is something else under that name, at least when it comes to one Ayn Rand.  Christopher Morris points out in the comments section, perhaps without the requisite exactness to really nail these ignorant critics/dismissers and paint them into a logical corner of their own making, that it boils down to *politics*, and if you don't think politics is a key corrupting influence in academic ""philosophy,"" then you haven't been around academic philosophy.  I'll venture to say that it's *all* about politics and the various cognitively-biasing factors that go along with that.  Whatever it is, it isn't philosophy in the true sense of the term.

How can these people remain ignorant of the key secondary literature on Rand and still claim to be doing anything fair and balanced?  It's insane.

This is such a slam-dunk, that it makes a Gotthelf-Leiter debate all that more tantalizing to consider.  Say that Leiter declines such a debate (against a leading Aristotle scholar currently at the #3 ranked philosophy program in the world, according to Leiter's own ""Gourmet Report""); that means he has to renounce all the shit-talk he said about Rand over the years if he wants to maintain a shred of intellectual credibility.  But who would Gotthelf (or Smith, or Salmieri, or . . .) find to debate *then*?

And there's where academic ""philosophy"" falls into such a sinkhole that I don't know how it would recover (other than to embrace Rand-and-Aristotle studies).  There is *no* figure within academic philosophy who possesses the knowledge or expertise to make a remotely credible case against Rand/Objectivism.  What we *do* see - for anyone who cares to open their eyes and look - is numerous (and expanding in number) scholars who possess much familiarity with Objectivism right down to its epistemological-methodological core - scholars with high-profile academic pedigrees, no less - who (unsurprisingly to those in the know) consider Rand to be one of the greatest philosophical minds of all time, whatever her shortcomings (and they're there, particularly in the content and style of her own criticisms/dismissals of *other* thinkers, namely Kant...).

Exploitation - what is an Objectivists take on it? It's inevitable that one would come across exploitation at some point in time in a less than ideal world. It happens.

Helping Others - I'm not speaking from an altruist sense, I'm speaking more from the sense of gaining satisfaction by helping others. Is all forms of helping others to be considering immoral and an act against one's self, slavery even? Or if you gain happiness and satisfaction in your work while helping others, knowing that you are not giving your life to people, is it still somewhat against one's self?

I'll get right to the point: I'm having a formal debate in one of my classes. My teacher, knowing I'm a lefty, has me arguing for Capitalism, and I thought, who are more pro-Capitalism than Objectivists? While I have read both Anthem and The Fountainhead, it was years ago, so I'm not entirely brushed up on the philosophy. I'm good at playing Devil's Advocate, which I most definitely will be doing for this but I could always use help.

Anyways, I need your absolute best criticisms of all Socialist/Communist thought and ideology, barring no school of thought (Marxism-Leninism, Maoism, etc., etc.). As well as the best pro-Capitalist arguments you have. I also realize that a lot of Objectivist thought comes down to moral arguments for Capitalism and against Communism, but a variety of arguments, not strictly moral, would be great. I'm going to be reading The Fountainhead again in preparation for this (sadly, I don't yet have a copy of Atlas Shrugged).

The author states that if you have chosen life as your goal, then right and wrong actions are based on whether those actions help you achieve your goal.  I'm on board with all that.

However, she says that the choice of life as your goal is pre-rational, since without a goal already in mind, you don't have a foundation to help you choose.  So when choosing life or death for yourself, neither is really wrong.

However, I got to thinking, life or death aren't the only two possible choices.  What if instead of holding my own life as my highest value, I choose to hold the life of my wife as my highest value.  If this is a pre-rational choice, it can't really be ""wrong"".

However, I would think that Rand would suggest that to devote your entire life to someone, to place them as your highest value, over your life, is wrong.

I guess really what my question is, of all the things you could choose as your highest value, why choose one over another, if you have no rational bases to make the choice?

It's as if Rand were here today describing exactly the effect modern philosophy is having on political discussion. In classic pragmatist fashion, acting first, thinking later (Occupy first. Demands come later.) is hailed as virtuous. Capitalism is blamed for the failures of our society, yet there is a person in that thread claiming that government force is not the necessary alternative.

&gt;&gt;Goods can move from person to person either via voluntary wanted economics trade, or goods can move from person to person via involuntary unwanted political redistribution. There is no third way possibility.

&gt;False dichotomy. There are degrees of ""voluntary"" and ""involuntary"" that are dependent upon government policy, social climate, personal finances, industry economies, law, and so forth. The rest of your argument deconstructs itself from there.

Zizek somehow twists his rhetoric to not only eschew principled action, but pragmatism as well! What will be left to replace pragmatism when even that naive philosophy is abandoned? Zizek doesn't seem to know or care, and actually seems to welcome the approaching oblivion!

&gt;What one should resist at this stage is precisely such a quick translation of the energy of the protest into a set of “concrete” pragmatic demands. Yes, the protests did create a vacuum — a vacuum in the field of hegemonic ideology, and time is needed to fill this vacuum in a proper way, since it is a pregnant vacuum, an opening for the truly New.

If you're in LA, you're welcome to come by my place tonight. Gary Johnson is giving a talk and an open Q&amp;A and then we'll break into a conversational cocktail party. Gary will stick around for a bit, you can chat with him one on one. Nathaniel and Barbara Branden will also be here, as well as some other interesting prominent people. I'm pretty sure Peter Joseph (who created the Zeitgeist Movie) should show up. All the details are on the Facebook invite page here:

http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=224591447557612

I am thrilled that more Libertarian voices are gaining national attention. I hope to see many more libertarian voices gain prominence. This event is my small way of contributing to that cause, towards spreading our ideas to a wider audience. 

I wrote up a brief post on Gary Johnson for my blog at Hustle Bear when he spoke at my house last month:

So at this point, I feel I have a pretty good grasp on the principles of Objectivism, but if I'm wrong about anything I write here, don't hesitate to correct me.

In any event, the question I want to ask is: is there an Objectivist answer for consumption of resources at a sustainable rate?  To elaborate, I was thinking about problems with a resource that is replenish-able but is being used at a lopsided rate.  The example I used was over-fishing.  

As I understand it (i.e. correct me if I'm wrong), Objectivists believe very strongly about the free market and how unrestricted free market principles provide the best outcome for everything.  In the case of over-fishing, I asked how an Objectivist might explain why over-fishing exists at all because surely fishermen must realize that at some rate, the fishing rate becomes unsustainable and their own livelihood would be at stake.

He responded that the problem lies within the lack of property rights.  I understood his argument, but then I asked how implementing something like that would be possible at this point.  He replied that it would pretty much have to have been setup that way from the get-go.  I don't mean to over-simplify his words, just trying to be succinct. 

So I ask: What do you guys/gals think?  Is there an Objectivist solution to this sort of problem that doesn't something I think is impossible at this point (over-hauling the system)?

I thought it was technically phenomenal. The writing was excellent, as is typical Ayn Rand, who I believe to be the Queen of the Show-Don't-Tell kingdom, and the sorceress of the English language. I'm still amazed how English was her second language. I thought the characters were incredibly complex and interesting, probably the most realistic characters I've ever read in a Rand book. I especially like Andrei Taganov; and I was amazed that Ayn Rand painted a communist in a good, and even heroic and noble, light. I really liked the dialogue, for it felt stifled at times and forced—kind of like you were reading a translated book from Russian, which it's supposed to be at times. It added a really nice charm. The story was incredibly realistic (for the most part), and it and its characters felt more real and alive than *Atlas Shrugged* or *Anthem*.

But, unlike *Atlas Shrugged* and *Anthem*, I did not enjoy this.

I must say that going from *Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Seas* to *We the Living* was a massive shock; I went from a world with so many wonders, with human ingenuity pushed forward by that natural human thirst for knowledge, into this bleak, gray, incredibly gray, world where humans wither away and decay, where the ones who still have that urge to fight, the ones who would normally be above all, simply take longer to lose that urge than all their other peers.

There are technical things that I can criticize almost every book for; but, ultimately, whether I decide whether a book is good or not is based on how much I enjoy it, and I did not enjoy this.

And perhaps the most discordant thing in my mind is that the work is technically flawless: The prose is excellent; the imagery is amazing; and the characters are realistic, believable (which is saying a lot about most of Ayn Rand's characters). I only have two complaints: one is that the way how Kira met and fell in love with Leo required a big suspension of disbelief on my part and the other is that there were a few typos—but this last one wasn't even that big of a deal, and I easily got over the first one.

I don't know why, but I enjoyed *Nineteen Eighty-Four* more than this. Perhaps it's because *Nineteen Eighty-Four* had this futuristic, cool, sci-fi feel to it; while *We the Living* was brutally realistic and terrifying. 

I know that the Soviet Union was a bleak, depressing place; I know that people starved to death in the Soviet Union; I know that they simply struggled to stay alive. I read the history textbooks. And Ayn Rand did a amazing job of bringing this image to life through a narrative—and I experienced the Soviet Union in a way a textbook would never allow me to.

1355117856.0,9,self.Objectivism,14l9az,Problems in practical application of Objectivism in a modern world?,15,6,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/Objectivism/comments/14l9az/problems_in_practical_application_of_objectivism/,"Hi all,

I've been giving a lot of thought to some challenges in applying Objectivism in today's world and I was hoping that you might be able to help me work thought them. There are two distinct issues I'd like to tackle, which I'll do in separate posts...

**An Objectivist *country* in today's world.**

So imagine a country - lets say my home, Australia - adopts Objectivism today but the rest of the world *does not.* We are told that the only legitimate functions of government are:

 - The police, to protect people from criminals.

 - The armed services, to protect people from foreign invaders.

 - The law courts, to settle disputes among men according to objectively defined laws.""

In a purely theoretical and moral sense I agree with that 100% however when you apply it to a reality where there are other nation states with over a hundred different shades of government and different ways of doing business things get more complicated, I find myself thinking we'd need to add:

 - A ""Department of Foreign Affairs"", which conducts diplomacy on behalf of the country including treaties, application of 'soft power', looks after the rights of citizens of Australia while they're overseas and provides a liaison with other countries for their citizens when they are here.

 - A ""Department of Trade"", which conducts nation to nation and nation to business level trade, including ensuring that private companies have access to markets overseas on just terms"" - I say this because while I 100% agree with free and open markets few countries have truly free and open markets (ie: trade tariffs, domestic subsidies, over or under valued currencies, policies requiring domestic procurement and production etc present barriers to overseas competition).

 - A ""Department of Immigration and Citizenship"", which regulates who can come here, how long they can stay and under what conditions.

 - A ""Department of Primary Industries"", which ensures the security of our food production by regulating imports of organic materials and materials for use in agriculture (ie: Australia is 100% rabies free so we should regulate the import of dogs in order to ensure it stays that way, likewise, fruit flies pose a major risk to agriculture so we control how fruit is transported in to agricultural areas).

These four fairly basic services were what I came up with off the cuff... I'm sure I could come up with a few more points too, which is what worries me - sooner or later you end up with a fairly sizeable government with some pretty wide reaching powers.

So my first question is ""are the three purposes of government put forward by Rand negotiable? in essence, can Objectivism be seen as a 'framework' which you align to and take the best parts from leaving behind the parts which don't work for you, or is it a set methodology which must be done as is?""

Second question: ""if it is to be seen as a framework, and you can extend power beyond the original three, how do you limit the stretch of that power and prevent the downward slop to autocracy or socialism?""

Thanks for your time.",,False,self,t5_2qjr6,1355119427.0,,,True,t3_14l9az,http://www.reddit.com/r/Objectivism/comments/14l9az/problems_in_practical_application_of_objectivism/,

",19,10,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/Objectivism/comments/yufgb/robjectivists_how_best_can_we_ignite_an/,"I consider this question to be of the utmost importance; the future of human civilization is at stake.  We don't know how much global climate change, for instance, could impact humanity over the coming century.  For all we know, technological advance will immunize humankind from any mortal threats.  But for all we know, the needed advances might not come soon enough.  In any event, we want to see a future for humanity that is as bright as can be, whatever the challenges we might face.

And that's where intellectual and cultural revolution comes in.  We need it to happen ASAP.  We need, above all, first and foremost, a society of, by, and for the human intellect.  To make this happen would require a program of education.  We should not conflate education with schooling.  Education can happen, especially in the internet age, via online resources, via social media, via any number of channels in addition to schools.  The primary aim should be to actually take seriously what today's teachers, parents and political leaders pay mostly lip service to: the fullest-possible cultivation of the human intellect.

This program of education can happen at virtually any age, but it is in the young - the coming generation - that this program is most vital.  And a crucially integral part of such a program is education in the ways of critical thinking, i.e., of philosophy.  And we need to assign to Aristotle and Aristotelianism a place of utmost importance in such a program.  Aristotle's approach to philosophy represents the height of critical thinking in action.  What's more, there's an ethical and socio-political dimension to Aristotelianism that holds tremendous appeal to conscientious mainstream Americans (and non-Americans as well).  It places human flourishing or *eudaimonia* at the center of focus and emphasizes the role of maximal intellectual activity to achieving and maintaining *eudaimonia*.

So, **TL, DR version**, what my query is transformed into is: How do we best and most expeditiously ignite the people's interest in an Aristotle-inspired intellectual, ethical, cultural, social and political program?  Or, put more generally: how can we best ignite the people's interest in a *philosophical* mode of living, so as to maximize our chances for individual and social flourishing?

These come down to strategic questions.  Have we strategically-minded folks here?

* Video games an interactive environments, these are more of an art form to me being a game programmer.  I use pixels, sounds, and gameplay to express myself as an artist.  I hope one day I can use these to express something meaningful ( or at the very least, enjoyable ).
* Food and cooking, I want to understand food, how its made, how to craft these delicious resources into something I can enjoy everyday and have pride in.  I like brewing my own drinks, making things from scratch.  This makes me happy and accomplished.

If someone else were to then publish the book under his/her own name, would this not be a form of fraud to the reader who buys it?

But to win it requires your total dedication and a total break with the world of your past, with the doctrine that man is a sacrificial animal who exists for the pleasure of others. Fight for the value of your person. Fight for the virtue of your pride. Fight for the essence of that which is man: for his sovereign rational mind. Fight with the radiant certainty and the absolute rectitude of knowing that yours is the Morality of Life and that yours is the battle for any achievement, any value, and grandeur, any goodness, any joy that has ever existed on this earth.

She is a very hardcore liberal, and she made some good arguments after she got over being mad. I was wondering if /r/objectivism could help me out with some of these, as I don't know the objectivist position exactly, and I'm not sure if I can live with what they are.

*What about the 8-hour workday? After a point, don't people die from being forced to work that much in order to live? At that point, wouldn't equality of opportunity go down the drain, as these people would never have a chance to succeed? Also, what about minimum wage? Are unions expected to fix all of these problems?

*What about government regulations on food? I understand that in the end, everybody would buy the food that won't make you sick, but a lot of people wouldn't be able to buy it because it would be more expensive. Wouldn't the poor always be sick?

*I've never understood the objectivist view on education. It seems like an educated population helps everyone, mutual benefit and all that. If anything, it teaches you how to think, preventing dictatorship and making democracy work.

*Along the same line, what about infrastructure? It seems like everyone is a lot better off with public roads by not having to pay tolls constantly. I get that you do pay for them in taxes, but it's not like you have to stop every time you go.

*Health care is the last huge one. I have asthma and would've died when I was younger if not for the government paying my way. I know that doesn't make it right, but in the end it amounts to a lot of dead people. Is it really okay for there to be that many dead people? I guess that logically it is, but it sure as hell feels wrong. And also, don't I owe society because they gave to me? I know that I didn't have a choice in the matter, but I still owe in some way. How would it be in an objectivist society?

These are the main ones that she mentioned. Thank you for reading them all, and I'd appreciate help if possible. Just writing these down has helped with my understanding, but it would still be nice to see somebody else's opinion.

He asked me about a brute that enjoys causing destruction: why is that brute harming his own self interest by engaging in destruction if he enjoys it? ""What if what you value is the experience of causing pain itself?""


My response was that the brute's values are wrong: they don't have human life as the source of value, what the brute is doing is a weird form of hedonism, about the same as the pleasure you get from drinking or eating a bunch of sweets (but much worse because he's violating human rights), and is not a rational source of pleasure, but I felt like my argument was a little circular (life is standard of value, brute is self-interested but not *rational*, the brute is irrational because he doesn't place life as standard of value)

Help me out here: are there any good articles/ links to stuff that could help me explain this better?

On Friday I had a run in with a colleague which has been bugging me all weekend. The actual topic isn't really relevent because the process of the argument was so vanilla:

Me: X right should exist, with reasonable limits.

Him: X right should not exist, because there is no good reason for it.

Me: But there are reasons, such as A, B and C.

Him: But you don't need A, B and C to live like I do, so why should X right exist to support those?

Me: Because not everybody wants to live exactly like you do, and my right to X in order to practice A, B and C doesn't impact on you at all.


I have since come to a theory that I'd like to chew out with you free thinkers - I am thinking that there are three broad categories that people will approach a conversation on rights from:


 - Emotion, ideology and dogma: this person says ""I believe &lt;blah&gt; because of &lt;religion/political ideology/personal phobias like homophobia/etc&gt; and therefore everybody must conform to that."" These people rarely use logic or reason, and can rarely be negotiated with.

Example: ""Marriage is between a man and a woman, the bible says so, so gays can't marry!""


 - Rights negative: These people start with the assumption that a right does not exist and then challenge the other party to show why they SHOULD HAVE the right.

For example, ""a woman has no right to abort a fetus at any time, now tell me why they SHOULD be able to.""

 - Rights affirmative: these people assume that every right is held by every person, and then enter in to discussion about how those rights might clash with each other and accepts restrictions which are based on reason.

For example:

An absolute right to free speech clashes with a right to not be slandered/defamed, so how do we balance this?

An absolute right to abortion clashes with the right of a healthy 40 week old fetus/baby to live, given that by 40 weeks its fully formed and could live if birthed), so at what point does abortion stop being a right?


---

""Rights Negative"" could be changed to ""Privilege Based"" and ""Rights Affirmative"" could also become ""Rights Based"" if that works better for you, but the underlying point is that in my experience people either argue without any reason, or assert that no right exists and demand to be told why it *should* exist, or asset that the right always exists and seek to define how it might need to be moderated.

Do you feel this is an accurate observation?

If so, what might be done to frame a conversation so that a person from a ""Rights Affirmative"" position (which I always seem to take) would best be able to influence the other two positions?

Cheers!

I enjoy Ayn Rand's writings (both fictional and philosophical) and consider myself close to, if not completely, an objectivist, and I was wondering what my fellow reason-lovers think of the economics and politics of global climate change.

*Note: I am an objectivist, and I am also an optimist.  One of the things that attracted me to Ayn Rand's work was her portrait of man as a potentially heroic being.*

Here's are some of my thoughts.  It's a long post.  Please let me know what you think.

* 1: Why it is something to be mindful of. 

It seems like there is conclusive evidence that the amazing industrial advances we have come up with is affecting our climate, affecting it a way that has serious implications to our (humanity's) existence.
Implications that can limit or destroy other human's livelihoods and lives.
Implications that may come about in my life time.

* 2: Why it is reasonable to want to do something about it.

It seems like human-caused global climate change is a fact of reality, and one that should not be ignored or brushed aside.
Personally and selfishly, I would like the inhabitable world we live in to stay inhabitable; for my future self, for my children, and others who I love and care about.
Also, as someone who loves being human for the sake of the awesome powers we posses, and wants to ensure human ingenuity and our productive efforts be continued, I have some fondness for our future society.  (Please give me your thoughts on this view—kind of a “how do you other objectivists feel about the future?” question.)

* 3: Those who ignore it.

I believe that those who ignore this threat are denying reality, and by not tending to it are passing on a serious and life-threatening problem to their future loved ones, and if they truly cared about their future prodigy they would not commit such a lazy logical fallacy. (Yes, an assumption on my part is being made that people will love at least one family member of their future generations, or at least one person significantly younger than themselves.  I understand this will not always be the case, but I think it is common.) 

* 4: The scale of this problem is weird for an objectivist.

The following quote from Ayn Rand, although a great one and one of my favorites, seems to fall short in the instance of large-scale human action that has the potential of adversely affecting human (potentially my own!) existence.
&gt; ""When I disagree with a rational man, I let reality be our final arbiter; if I am right, he will learn; if I am wrong, I will; one of us will win, but both will profit.”

Does damage, so much so that it makes a shared ecosystem uninhabitable, need to be done by a singular person to be considered immoral?

Do you think those who, even in light of the data on climate change, willfully release large amounts of greenhouse gases are committing an act of aggression?

* 5: What I think I can morally do.

Convince others that global warming a serious issue that requires attention and action.

It's hard to see how it would happen on other subs but there are plenty of folks skeptical that it could happen here (given the perception that specialty subreddits are circle-jerks with differing opinion treated hostilely regardless of thoughtfulness).

Given how thoughtful discussion usually is here, how can we make meaningful discussion with reasonable skeptics/outsiders happen?

I believe in IP now.**

Hey /r/objectivism, you all gave me some really good info to think on over the week. I think, after several weeks of thought, I've finally come to believe in intellectual property.  It took me some real heavy brain cycles but I think I finally understand the philosophical underpinnings. Most of you agree with me the system around it is far from perfect.  But I will attempt to explain why I find the system justified and my explanation of what ""property"" actually is.  All in all I realized property is a much more contentious concept than what I originally believed ( both physical property and intellectual property ).


What exactly was it I was misunderstanding? There was a commonality to physical property and intellectual property i don't think I was paying attention to, specifically that physical property hasn't existed forever ( it just seems like it has, because everyone seems to own everything in the world right now ). Physical property, comes into existence in pretty much the same way as intellectual property.  The concept of homesteading process, is in fact, in essence very similar to taking your patent to the patent office. A man must prove he has created significant value to own something.  Back in the early American days, I think all this involved was having a fence, and a structure with one window.
 

Imagine a world, empty of nobody but Adam and Eve, there are no claims on the worlds property, property does not exist yet because nobody claimed a piece. Adam has to create value to live, and that act and effort must give him ownership to say, make a farm, otherwise he will die.  He must be able to make his cake and eat it too. Don't get me wrong, there are some societies with no concept of ownership exist.  They may be tribal or maybe even modern communistic.  But there is a natural law that mankind relies on natural resources still sitting there no matter what a tribe, state, or religion might believe.  If mankind didn't rely on needing resources to survive ( say we are some star trek energy entity ), we might have entirely different concepts of property.  But the natural law remains, and I believe this gives some objective credence to the principle that man must be able to own value he creates, or he will die. Even animals have a concept of territory without being philosophers.  Mankind, by extension, needs to be able to own his creations of value, otherwise he cannot survive and that applies to both the natural/physical property and intellectual property.


The other half of my beliefs that were holding me back was that I had misconceived how crystal clear physical property was as a concept.  I used to think that physical property is pretty set in stone and ""so easy to see"" but really it is not.  The whole concept of homesteading ( determining what value a person has to do to own a piece of land ) is just as nebulous as determining if a software patent is of enough value or not for someone to own.  It just appeared to me as though physical property seemed ""crystal clear"" because of the inertia of America's property laws, and title companies, and lawyers all setup to defend who owns what. But! Even behind that, there are uncertainties for instance, some native american tribes might have better claims to land than some modern Americans.


Property is all just a battle of people claiming they've created value to the world, and that they should own it and do with it what they want.  I used to think there was something special about physical property compared to intellectual, but it is all really just a judgement of creation of value being significant enough to assign ownership.  Because of the imperfect nature of man however, there's no cut and dry answers to what value actually is.  This requires the honest debate of thoughtful men to determine.


My principles are now in line with my gut feelings of fairness toward creators, and I feel I understand a bit better why.


What are some of the results of this understanding

* I don't feel I can agree with libertarians who are against IP now
* I now have more sympathy toward RIAA/MPAA, but I still think they should explore the value of legitimate ""piracy"" to their business as marketing
* I think to fix the patent office, we need to have people who can more clearly determine what is an easy/original idea and we need to eventually cull patents that become too easy in our society.  That concept of significant value is changing as our society grows more technologically advanced.
* I feel that virtual economies will really need help in the future in protecting property rights to come in order for us to truly be able to survive off of them

I've been reading through Objectivism: The Philosophy of Ayn Rand, by Leonard Peikoff.  In it he says that sense perception is a true representation of reality, and that errors of perception are actually errors of reason.  He gives the example of a stick that seems to bend when you put it in water.

However, this doesn't seem to mesh with what we know of neuroscience.  For example, the brain fills in the blind spot caused by the connection of the optic nerve.  What you see in that blind spot is a guess by the brain, not necessarily a true representation of reality.  Or take phantom limb, where someone with no arm can feel (sense) that arm being tickled.

It would seem the best you could say is that your senses are a true reflection of the firing of nerves in your brain, but that doesn't answer the ""brain in a vat"" idea.

Does Objectivism simply dismiss the evil demon as an arbitrary claim?

This sort of epistemology isn't very useful to me, but it is an interesting question.  It would be nice if there were a rational answer.  Decartes' required the existence of God to disprove the evil demon.",,False,self,t5_2qjr6,False,,,True,t3_yo41d,http://www.reddit.com/r/Objectivism/comments/yo41d/question_on_objectivsm_and_cartesian_epistemology/,

Ever since I read my first Rand book (The Fountainhead, almost exactly one year ago), I've been trying to reconcile her theory of sex with my pick-up-artist ways.

I agree profoundly with the Objectivist theory of love as a response to moral values, and it has without a doubt curbed my hedonistic approach to sex.

But if I'm going to renounce promiscuous, meaningless sex completely, I'm gonna need more than:

&gt;Sex is one of the most important aspects of man’s life and, therefore, must never be approached lightly or casually. A sexual relationship is proper only on the ground of the highest values one can find in a human being. Sex must not be anything other than a response to values. And that is why I consider promiscuity immoral. Not because sex is evil, but because sex is too good and too important . . . . (Lexicon)

So I just had this little epiphany.


After reading some of Rands stuff,
leaving all ideology and morality aside, I think the strong appeal of objectivism, is basically *a strong emotional response to the human spirit to create grand things, without stupid dimwits fucking it all up.
*

Would you describe this as somewhat accurate ?


I find this very interesting,
because even though I, as an egalitarian anarchist,
am basically from the very polar opposite camp,
my motivations that drove me there are actually very similar,
and even though I strongly disagree with Rands conclusions,
I can clearly see where she is coming from, and although I strongly disagree with Rands conclussions, I can accept the uplifting spirit behind her writings.


I didn't come here to fight, or clash ideologies, it has been done to death, but rather for a friendly discussion of our motivations.

**Scarcity Theory of Property**

As some of you may be aware, the ""Anarcho-Capitalism"" crowd has taken to Stefan Kinsella's argument says (paraphrased) *""scarcity is the source of property rights, therefore IP is invalid""* as well as [similar fallacies.](http://jamescarlin.wikidot.com/intellectual-property:fallacies-list)  This appears to be a blatant utilitarian reinvention of property rights, completely detached from every historical theory of property rights as well as the basis of Libertarian, Voluntarism, and Anarcho-Capitalism.

**My Project / Feedback**

This project is in a ""raw"" form (needs content, cleanup, sorting, etc), but you can view it at the link below.  My goals are to (a) clearly refute the ""scarcity theory of property"" *(and other fallacies)* from a Libertarian/Voluntarist perspective, and (b) clearly define an objective (ethical, libertarian) form of Intellectual-Property, not based on the existence or legitimacy of any government.

* **[Voluntarist Intellectual Property Analysis](http://jamescarlin.wikidot.com/intellectual-property)**

**Refining I.P.**

Government-defined-intellectual property and enforcement is clearly highly flawed, however this isn't a condemnation against all I.P.  As such, I worked on a refining  ""I.P."" over the last few months to be consistent with voluntarism/libertarianism and property rights, arriving at  ""Creative Property.""

* [**Creative Property**](http://jamescarlin.wikidot.com/intellectual-property:creative-property):  *""the ownership of a creative (unique and original) form.""*
* [**Creative**](http://jamescarlin.wikidot.com/intellectual-property:definitions): *""a unique form, created through imaginative skill and original thought.""*
* [**Unique:**](http://jamescarlin.wikidot.com/intellectual-property:definitions) *""one-of-a-kind form could have never reasonably occurred without the application of creative thought and effort by the original creator(s)""*

While not based on Ayn Rand's work, it appears to be [extremely consistent and compatible with her conclusions](http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/patents_and_copyrights.html) on copyrights and patents.

1325341973.0,9,self.Objectivism,nxinv,New Atlantis,12,3,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/Objectivism/comments/nxinv/new_atlantis/,"Reposted with permission from Alexander Strugatsky:

I am addressing this request to all Objectivists and adherents to Ayn Rand’s philosophy.  No doubt it is clear to all (of the above) that socialism has taken over the entire industrial world, including the “hearts and minds” of the majority of its inhabitants.  Sure, some vestiges of capitalism still exist -someone has to produce the food and the goods we use –but under socialist government controls.  I don’t need to present the obvious here, except for reiterating a major point – things are getting worse and, in the foreseeable future will not get better.  The end result, of course, will be a collapse, but that is not much of a consolation if we, and our families, have to live through the collapse, possible civil wars and, we can hope, a re-birth.  In Atlas Shrugged, Ayn Rand found an Atlantis, hidden somewhere in Colorado.  Unfortunately, Colorado is not available anymore.  But what if we can build an Atlantis?

This is really not that farfetched.  There are several studies, funded by billionaires of Ayn Rand leaning, such as the founder of PayPal Peter Thiel  (http://seasteading.org/ ) investigating the possibility of floating city states.  I do not know the details of those projects, but they appear to seek the Atlantis – based on laissez-faire capitalism and free from existing governments.  So far as I know, these have all been paper studies of fairly small structures that are not completely self-sufficient or independent.  But what if a large, self-sufficient city state can be built?  Based on Objectivist principles, it will attract the best minds; based on laissez-faire capitalism they will be productive; and not being under the control of socialist governments, they will thrive.  Is such a city state possible?  Technologically, I think that it is possible.  Perhaps even with today’s technology.  With tomorrow’s – it is inevitable.  Is it feasible economically?  Today – that depends on how much one values their freedom and unrestricted pursuit of happiness.  Tomorrow, as more and more of our labors are being taken away – the answer should be obvious.

My proposal is to begin this process ourselves.  We are a community of thousands of professionals.  We have the skills and the knowledge to accomplish at least the first phase – a design of such a city state.  Physical and cultural/socio/political design.  The New Atlantis will have to be large enough to support itself, including power generation and food production, and be powerful enough to defend itself and its freedom.  To make this possible, we can create a database of designs, in an almost game-like manner, where professionals in various fields submit their designs in the area of their expertise.  These designs would be peer reviewed and awarded merit tokens based on the complexity and value of their designs, similar to the Bitcoin system.  The complexity of the design will be enormous – the physical design itself will have to address everything needed for complete life-support system, from power to water to air, and a myriad other all important details, such as quality of life and those things that make life pleasant.  The constitution will need to be developed (perhaps based on the 1789 version, but so amended as to prevent its degeneration) and the laws written as well.

For those who would like to participate in the project, I can offer the following:  You will participate in a thrilling intellectual exchange with your peers and create the most advanced designs possible.  Your designs will become an intellectual property of the organization that we will create and each designer will become a part owner of this intellectual property (through the Bitcoin or similar system).  The total design may eventually be worth billions, and you’ll own a share of it.  Finally, by working on this project, you can have real hope for the future.

I have thought of some details, yet much more needs to be formulated.  But to start with, I want to know the reaction of as many Objectivists as I can reach.  Please reply with your thoughts and suggestions, good or bad.

Thanks,

I want to believe that private entities would work fine. If I were running such a business, I imagine I would combine it with a Fire Insurance plan to keep myself honest and at sufficient capacity to deal with any potential issues.

But, based on what I've read, private fire brigades appear to have failed pretty badly in the past. When I consider the potential liability of having my house burn to the ground, or my neighbors house burning and catching mine on fire, it seems like a pretty straightforward decision. The tax is relatively cheap, and would appear to be in the interest of 100% of the population. Why not use a government fire department?

It means that in order to be an Objectivist, you must accept Rand's metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, politics, and esthetics. You don't have to have a problem with a woman being president, or anything else she said that was not a direct part of her philosophy. Some of you seem to think that the definition is just 'the truth'. Well, I'm flattered, but that's not the definition, and if you think that something Rand said was wrong, you can't say that she somehow failed at being an objectivist, and that you are the real objectivist.

As I studied objectivism, I could not help but realize that I had developed the same skill (although not always lightning fast).  I have found this profoundly useful in dealing with people - ideally helping them see what is the root of their errors in a constructive manner, but also sometimes just knowing when to abandon a relationship with a person.

I came here to ask two questions relating to this:

•	Ayn Rand advocated moral egoism

* Moral egoism is **exactly** the same as hedonism

* Interestingly enough, the first time he linked them he said he “wasn’t quite sure” whether that was true.  The next 4 times?: **Quite sure it’s true**.

* He knew this person who died from a heroin overdose, therefore, moral egoism/hedonism will kill you (and presumably Ayn Rand killed that person?  I think that’s what he was getting at).

* Of course, at no point was the word “rational” ever used, in any context

•	“Quoting” from *The Virtue of Selfishness*: “Any Rand said that it is immoral to help another person” – LITERALLY, HE LITERALLY SAID THIS.

•	Moral egoism can explain everything in terms of self interest

* A theory that explains everything is fundamentally flawed, i.e. wrong.

* There’s actually an interesting point (very well) hidden in this line of thinking, in that a non-informative theory has no value, but that was never said / explained further.  And obviously no rebuttal was given to that nonexistent point

•	Moral egoism denies that equals should be treated equally

* This was “explained” in a personal example of how the professor was in Cuba and the music school there only lets people in based on talent, whereas when he was teaching at St. John’s College, a student of his that failed sophomore math (which usually means that they would leave the college (St. John’s is difficult)) was allowed to stay because they were a “full-payee” i.e. paying tuition in full, no grants, loans, etc.

* This is wrong! Wrong he says!

* However the first part is okay.

•	Feinberg’s Single-Minded Hedonist apparently shows that a rock cannot be happy

•	I wish I had brought a bottle of wine to class today

And on a final note, no I didn’t say anything in class today, I’m far too much of a pacifist.  Also, I’ve found that pointing out how college-level professors (at least in introductory courses) are…mistaken…doesn’t actually do anything.  After all, *he’s published!*  (And apparently, if you’re a moral egoist, you can’t argue for moral egoism???  Really didn’t get that….)

So many fallacies... 

&gt;**Contrary to the expectations of free market economics,** evolution has wired people to feel better when they trust and
help one another. In one sense trust is its own reward. But in another sense, public trust is the way a group - a species -
ensures its survival. Trust in this sense creates more effective collective and coordinated action, not only by reducing
transaction costs, but selecting for those joint behaviors that exploit all the resources of a group. (ed: wtf?) (double ed: disregard first ed note, the author is clearly talking about comparative advantage here, my bad on this part.)

&gt;**So strong is the survival premium of people NOT endlessly competing with one another,** (though competition certainly has its place,) that human beings have evolved “mirror neurons” that enable them to understand what others are experiencing, in short, to empathize with one another. Although people have a natural propensity to trust, trust is not
necessarily ‘blind”. It requires transparency, accountability and credible ways of signaling success. Even though evolution
has recognized the importance of trust by encoding it in many neural mechanisms, there still have to be certain types of “social scaffolding” in order for these innate social mechanisms of trust to function.

&gt;According to evolutionary psychologists and biologists, the human brain evolved many highly sophisticated social exchange algorithms for interpreting, signaling, and coordinating human interactions. It turns out that human beings evolved as a social species - not as atomic individuals, and hence, evolved joint innate mechanisms for shared behaviors and experiences.

&gt;**The reason that markets work is not because of any individual capacity for reflecting on rational self interest, (”lucid greed”) but rather because of biologically encoded, preconscious mechanisms for joint social exchange and coordination.**

Emphasis added.

means—and it sets the standard by which all lesser goals are evaluated. An
organism’s life is its standard of value: that which furthers its life is the
good, that which threatens it is the evil. [...] Metaphysically, life is the only phenomenon that is an end in 
itself"" [...] ""The fact that a living entity is,
determines what it ought to do."" ... ""to a living consciousness,
every 'is' implies an 'ought.'"" ... ""The Objectivist ethics holds man’s life as the standard of value—and his
own life as the ethical purpose of every individual man.""

This is from the very first lecture in the Virtue of Selfishness, in which she describes the very meaning of the 
words ""good"" and ""evil"" and describes why it maters. In reading this, it becomes clear that she is saying for every 
living creature, continuing to live is the primary value, goal, and ""good thing"". Which is reasonable, since one 
cannot have any goals or values after one is dead.

That said, hypothesize a poor sick man. He can't afford to pay a doctor, and he will soon die without treatment 
from a doctor. Why is it not morally good for him to obtain the services of a doctor without paying for them himself? He can go to a private doctor and threaten that doctor with force, or he can go to an emergency room and 
lie about his ability to pay, or rely on socialized medicine or the fact that (in the US) it is illegal to refuse 
treatment at an emergency room based on finances.

Given that the alternative is death for this man, and that life is the ultimate value and final goal to which all 
lesser goals are the means, should the dying man sacrifice his life to avoid making the doctor do something the 
doctor wouldn't have done? Does that not mean that avoiding taking from the doctor is a higher goal for him than 
saving his own life? Isn't he sacrificing his life to avoid taking unfair advantage of the doctor or society or 
whoever winds up footing the bill?

This is the fundamental disconnect I haven't been able to figure out. 

Rand starts throwing around ""man qua man"" 
phrases, as if this explains it, but if you're dead, you're neither man nor are you man qua man. Plus, man is still a living organism, and all living organisms have a goal to keep living, rational or not. Arguing that the sick man should die because he's rational but the starving coyote is good with killing and eating the rabbit would seem to imply that life is *not* the highest value for rational creatures.

She talks about ""The virtue of Rationality means the recognition and acceptance of reason
as one’s only source of knowledge, one’s only judge of values and one’s
only guide to action."" Yet nothing in her description of rationality implies that one should not initiate force against 
others to save one's own life. It seems completely rational that if I'm dying and I can't afford the medicine, I 
should try to steal it.

Is Rand saying it's OK to steal or even murder to save your life? Because that's usually not what I hear Objectivists claim.",,False,self,t5_2qjr6,True,,,True,t3_te4un,http://www.reddit.com/r/Objectivism/comments/te4un/maybe_someone_can_explain_this_to_me/,

I'm all for a free market and argue in favor of it all the time. Trouble is, I've been thinking a bit about the cost of health care and wondering if it is the best way.  Here's what I mean..

Capitalism works because it leaves the choice of whether to buy something up to the consumer and hence that dictates the prices at which a producer can sell at; however, it seems to me that if you have to choose between saving your life and paying a crap ton of money it is obviously in your best interest to preserve your value (that being your life).  However, what if in doing so you cause the quality of your life to drastically diminish because you are hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt. When people are so loaded with that kind of debt and are therefore unable to be productive members of society because all their money, such as it is, goes to paying off their medical bills isn't that also a detriment to the rest of us, for example.

Perhaps I haven't thought it through enough, but I wanted to see what r/objectivism has thought about the subject.

1328998230.0,7,self.Objectivism,pl8qg,Report on Emotions,12,5,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/Objectivism/comments/pl8qg/report_on_emotions/,"This post is about a specific aspect of emotions. Namely, the idea that emotions are present or current (lightning-estimates of value premises as they say). 

When I first got into Objectivism, this feature of emotions seemed straight forward and pretty obvious, but it took quite a bit longer to see it for myself. Moving from memorized facts and 'rationalistic castles' to first hand observations and understanding has been my obsession of late. 

For this reason, I'll explain via story how I began to understand and concertize this aspect of emotions...

It is 6am, my alarm is buzzing.  My perfectly reasonable plan is to rise out of my cozy, warm bed and get some exercise, but all of sudden doesn't sound like a good plan anymore. I begin the self-dueling back-n-forth, which, at 6am, consists of an impressive amount of rationalizations, bargaining, whim worship, etc.

My status-quo in this type of case is to, in effect, ignore or suppress my emotions and 'force' myself to get out of bed and go. This does work, been doing it for years, but I'm realizing that it might not be the best way to go. So this time, I didn't try to cast off or condemn my supposedly 'wrong' emotions and just thought them through (introspection):

Does it make sense to feel this way? - *there are no causeless emotions* -
Why did I feel motivated last night, but not now? - *not sure yet* -
How does this make sense? What else do I know about emotions?*

And then I started to see, If emotions are lightning fast, automatic responses then it *makes sense that I don't feel like getting up*. My emotions are responding to the current situation, 6am, lying comfortably in bed. What did I expect to feel in this time and place? Would it make more sense, in this context, to feel elation at the prospect of getting out of bed and going into the cold for exercise? So, this time, I consciously and deliberately acknowledged the fact that I ought, to some extent, feel the way I do (Lazy, unmotivated) in this time and place. 

At first, I committed only to rolling out of bed and standing up.  As I was standing beside my bed, *feeling*, something was different. I wasn't fighting myself with emotional suppression, I wasn't 'forcing' myself toward action, I wasn't trying to bury the 'lazy' feelings. I had accepted that what I felt lying in bed, is not what I feel now, nor should it be - emotions are current. My mental 'state' was not bogged down, I was free to move onto the next moment, free to look ahead and to exercise.

Since that morning, I have became much more aware of how my emotions operate, I don't fight them as much, and I believe that grasping the 'present' aspect of them in a personal way has made a big difference.

In an objectivist society, it would be every man, woman, and child's top interest to ensure there is both wide scale availability of information and freedom of information.  To not participate, support, or acquire the means for it would perhaps be the worst thing one could do to one's self.

Quite literally, our capability for accessing free knowledge is the engine of an effective society.  Luckily, we're in a society where information problems are becoming exponentially easier to overcome:

- Mobile devices with instant information availability almost anywhere
- Capability to provide information for millions of people in realtime is here
- Most civilized countries still have the ability to say anything you want

We just need to stick up for free information and demand and pay for the best in service!
