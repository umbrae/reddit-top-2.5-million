AMA - This is in response to the immense amount of messages and questions I've recieved from people wanting to know more about my job, mostly students. Let me put it all out there for everyone!",40,1,49,http://www.reddit.com/r/environmental_science/comments/sukir/iama_young_environmental_consultant_ama_this_is/,"Graduated in August, 2010 with a major in Geology and minor in Environmental Studies. I did a 6-week hydrogeology field course in MI (message me for details, everyone I know from that course has a job!), and got my 40-hour HAZWOPER prior to even starting to look for jobs. I work for a very small firm, and so our environmental component of the company consists of me and my boss, who is an old dog and very wise as far as environmental consulting is concerned. Because of this I have a wide variety of work experience, such as:

* Phase II environmental site assessments (geoprobe drilling)

* Phase I ESA's, mostly my boss but I help him a bit.

* Asbestos inspections (I am a licensed inspector)

* Lead paint inspections (non-residential only, not licensed)

* Wetland delineations

* Ground Penetrating Radar surveys

* General oversight, excavation, UST fills, etc

* Maybe a few other things here and there, but ask away!

I am not a pro, but the idea was to answer questions to younger folks about how to break into the field, what entry level jobs are like. If you are a more experienced consultant, please feel free to fill in and answer for me, or correct me.

I should note its about an hour or two before bed, so I will get to questions eventually! I have a huuuuge wetland job so I will probably be in the middle of nowhere tomorrow with no 3G or service, but I will eventually reply to you.",,False,self,t5_2s90l,True,,,True,t3_sukir,http://www.reddit.com/r/environmental_science/comments/sukir/iama_young_environmental_consultant_ama_this_is/,

I have seen people offer really good advice on this subreddit in the past, and so the time has come for me to seek advice from the wise-ones.

I have my very first interview for an oxford-based environmental consultancy on Monday (2:00pm GMT). This is a fairly small firm, and I got this interview purely by being persistent, and with a bit of luck. This does mean, however, that they do not have a lot of online material to research or ""skills required"" etc, and so I think it is a bit less formal than for the equivalent interview with a huge firm (e.g. ARUP, URS, RSK etc).

As such, I beg of you, anyone with any experience, what in name of tard are they going to ask me? How should I present myself? What skills should I portray? Do you have any solid advice?

All advice is very welcome, whether or not you may have failed  or passed an interview in the past (why/how?), are currently/previously a consultant, or part of a recruitment team etc etc. 

Thanks so much,

ES Love,

I'm a geologist so I can handle soils and hydrology just fine, but I struggle with the plants. Oh ya, This is in Northern Indiana.

A few Q's I'd like to ask but I will try to avoid a wall of text:

-Portions of the property are clearly wetlands, some have surface water. But I am concerned about the rest of the property, which is largely vacant farmland (I'd guess unused for a few years). Obviously drainage tiles are going to muck up the hydrology, and cause the area to not be classified as a wetland. How do I approach this?

-Here is the link to the plants I havent been able to ID. Any leads on what some could be? Any info is nice even if the species name isnt exact I can probably track it down from the narrowed family list. http://imgur.com/a/2tpwZ

I think I had a few others but its friday and my brain is fried. Feel free to help or not, if nothing else we can open up a discussion with other wetland delineation specialists.

Now it's 2013 (I won't be starting the Environmental Science classes until 2014) and, needless to say, many of the things I learned in high school are no longer my strong suits.  In fact, I don't think I could even begin to talk to you about basic chemistry or biology, simply because I'm now clueless...

So my question to you experts is, how can I be prepared going into this degree program?  I know all schools are different, but are there certain things I should be focusing on more than others?  Would it be beneficial for me to study up on some of the basics before throwing myself to the sharks in a college-level course?

Sorry since this seems to be another question/advice thread while there are 2 already, but I had some questions I hope this community can give some insights on.  

I graduated undergrad about a year ago I am interested in a career dealing with conservation/ecology.  After graduating, I originally wanted to work for a few years to gain some experience and because I was a bit burned out on school.  However the last year I have had spotty employment opportunities (one short term research position with another coming up, some small computer/IT related jobs, nothing concerning ecology/env-sci except from some local volunteer work for a local nature preserve) and I am thinking about going back for a masters degree.  It seems like the only choice to really start a career for me at this point.  

One of the programs that caught my eye is environmental studies MA and MS programs.  So my questions are:

1.  For environmental studies, it seems to me that an MA is more geared toward public policy/law while the MS is more geared for ecology/science?  Is this a correct assumption?

2.  I am interested in the MS, as I mentioned I'd like to get into a career focusing on restoration ecology, conservation, or something similar.  After this year of crappy job outlooks, I want to make sure that there is a job market out there for this field: is there?  I know it's good to follow your dreams and stuff but I also need a job that offers better health insurance and the ability to pay off my student loans.  I know a degree doesn't automatically equal a career, but I'd like to know if there is a healthy amount of opportunities out there before I commit to 2-3 years of more schooling.

3.  What are some other career paths with someone with an MS in environmental studies?  Most of the college websites I visit have very vague descriptions of what you can do after getting your degree (“you can work for the government, work for a non-profit, etc!” then they list 4 or 5 students that make their program look good).  I would like some concrete information before deciding to plunge into such a commitment.  On this subreddit, I have read about GIS, water testing, and environmental consulting, I'd like to know about these and some other paths as well.

4.  My college background actually has a mix of social and natural science (poli-sci and biology) which is why when I looked at the Environmental Studies programs, I seemed like a good fit.  While I am more interested in the MS, if anyone working from the public policy/law side of things would like to give their insight for that career path, I would also be interested.

Right now, I'm not married to any idea and and looking at a masters (whether of arts or science) as a risky venture.  Most of the grad schools I am looking at are smaller schools in-state (I live in the US).  While I'd like a good program, I'm also looking to keep the price of school down as much as possible.  

If anyone can answer any of these questions or provide some insight beyond what I have here, I would truly appreciate it.  Thanks for reading.",,False,self,t5_2s90l,False,,,True,t3_wejwj,http://www.reddit.com/r/environmental_science/comments/wejwj/educationcareer_post_undergrad/,

I am an environmental consultant in Western NY. My review is coming up in about 2 months and with it, a pay adjustment.

I was hired for a pretty basic position but I've far exceeded the duties and levels of effort for pretty much everything and I have definitely evolved my position into a much more advanced one.  The problem is I am still paid like a beginner/entry level employee.

I recently came into some financial trouble and I spoke to my supervisor because I needed to have an idea of where my salary would be adjusted to in order to stay with this company (that I really like).  He was totally okay with giving me at least the raise I wanted to expect (from 36,400 to about 45,000), but because we work for a big company, there are hoops to jump through.

He said the best way for me to get what I want is to help him prepare data. I've collected average salaries for the work I actually do (Biologist II and GIS Analyst II on salary.com and Biologist with 4 years experience on payscale.com) but I want as much information as I can to secure a fair raise.

Can anyone in a similar position share their salaries and region so I can maybe have a little more data?

My job duties include:
-field work
     -wetland delineations
     -habitat assessments
     -species specific surveys (primarily bats)
     -invasive species surveys (bats, coyote, nutria)
-reporting

     -impact assessments

This is a fine assignment and I've been learning a lot in the literature review process, but I am having a serious problem nailing down a particular research question.

I am finding that whichever path I take, whether wetlands as carbon sinks in urban settings or long term effects of changing saline tidal wetlands to freshwater via treatment (SF Bay area), I can't find data gaps or places with little to no research. This is a silly wall to be hitting because it seems to be common knowledge that in science, there isn't really an end to research and investigation. Considering how new wetlands research is (30-40 years old-ish) and how big of an area wetlands are both physically on our planet and the areas they impact, I don't see how I can't find research questions that haven't been answered.

So I'm curious if there are any professionals, or non-professionals for that matter, who know of areas in wetlands research that need either initial attention given or additional attention given. What do we not know about wetlands that just needs to be researched? Where are the mysteries in wetland ecology or wetland policy? Does the scientific community have any suspicions about correlations that just haven't been proved yet? Any advice on how to land on a research question?

This is my first real experience writing any sort of grant or research proposal, so I might just be over thinking it.

First off, I have to say this is definitely one of the most useful subreddits I've ever found.  Lurking through all of the posts and comments here helped me decide that I'd love to go into environmental consulting, but now I have some questions of my own.


**Background:**  I recently graduated with an Environmental Science degree and moved to the Pittsburgh area.  After attending a hydrogeology field camp last summer, I know that's the type of work I eventually want to be doing.  I have a few firms picked out that at least partially specialize in this, and I'm just about done with all the necessary background research.  Outside of classes and field camp, I have no prior work experience in this field.  Ideally, I aiming for an entry level position to assist staff in the field for sampling purposes and in the office for report preparation (or work on these independently).


**Question:**  What do the types of firms I'm interested in look for in a good resume?  Some things I was considering...


* *Relevant coursework* - My GPA isn't the greatest, but I'm from a small liberal arts college with notoriously tough grading.  My major-specific courses were quite good, though. Should I include grades for these?

* *Software knowledge* - No specific certifications or anything, but I did take an ArcGIS course and am generally proficient in Microsoft Office and a few other relevant programs.  Also, how specific should I get (i.e. ESRI ArcGIS ArcView v9.3 with Spatial Analyst and 3D Analyst, etc.)?

* *Experience with field methods and instruments* - I put together a list of most of the specific things I've used before, but I'm thinking that would just bog the resume down.  Will it suffice to say something like, 'experience with surveying equipment, GPS, proxy coring equipment, well tests,' and so on?

* *Major research topics and writing examples* - I couldn't fit an independent research project into my schedule, but I did write many well-received essays and reports.  Is it appropriate to list some of the more relevant topics and then bring examples to interviews?


Sorry about the length and specificity, but I'm just worried a bad resume will prevent me from doing what I want.",,False,self,t5_2s90l,False,,,True,t3_1gm5x7,http://www.reddit.com/r/environmental_science/comments/1gm5x7/questions_about_consulting_resumes/,

A groundwater sample collected when the well went in showed minimal contamination, however, a single PAH exceeded state criteria.  Wells installed up and downgradient are non-detect for all compounds (VOCs, SVOCs), not just below the criteria, NON Detect.  Essentially, this LNAPL is not partitioning into the groundwater for whatever reason, groundwater is not affected.  Years of data showing the up and downgradient wells are non-detect has not deterred the regulators, who insist groundwater is contaminated. 

So, I need to get a sample of that groundwater, which won't be easy.  This LNAPL is some crazy stuff, it is an old crude/bunker oil,  it has the viscosity of chocolate syrup, and a specific gravity of almost 1.  When an interface probe hits this stuff it becomes so coated that it is rarely possible to determine the oil/water interface below.  Due to the sp. gravity and small diameter of the well, just the act of putting an interface probe in the well completely mixes the LNAPL and water, it doesn't dissolve, it just emulsifies within the water.  Anything that goes into the LNAPL becomes completely, thickly coated.

I can pump all of the NAPL out of the well, and then pump another 20 gallons of napl/water mix, it takes a couple of months for the NAPL to recover to 10' due to how viscous it is.  I'm thinking of pumping everything out and then quickly putting tubing in, groundwater recovery will be rapid, protecting tubing from napl initially, then purge (low flow) like hell a month or so later when the water has equilibrated.

Any one have any tricks for getting sample tubing through LNAPL to get a clean GW sample from below?",,False,self,t5_2s90l,False,,,True,t3_17o4cu,http://www.reddit.com/r/environmental_science/comments/17o4cu/technical_advice_collecting_groundwater_below/,

",11,4,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/environmental_science/comments/13wqli/not_to_beat_a_dead_horse_but_as_a_prospective/,"A little background on my situation: I started off my college career at an art college planning on doing something with either illustration or photography but that didn't pan out for me.  I ended up trying to transfer to ""real school"" but I was told that because I don't have a GPA (art courses were pass/fail) that I would have to go to a community college to build a gpa.  So I went and banged out a year of all but a few gen.ed courses and am now at a state university as a declared major of environmental science.  Third year of college, and I feel like a freshman now.

I know I want to be involved with the environment somehow, but I am in a completely different setting from the art school mindset, so I don't really know what to expect as far as potential jobs or lifestyle or anything like that.  

Finally getting around to my actual questions:

*What does an environmental consultant actually do?

*If I want to do something more involved with current issues such as climate related, water shortage, new green technology (i have no experience in engineering), what should i do?  these things are in contrast to conditioning where and what people can develop areas or wetland protection

*If I want to travel to different cool places, what should i look into?  The romance of seeing the world is something I want to look into, and having a job that would allow that would be cool too, although I recognize that this may be a tad unrealistic

*What should I focus on in school?  I already set up to take a couple of GIS courses, municipal land use and resource management as well as a couple of other courses

*any other advice would be greatly appreciated!

her basic conclusion was this:   planting one crop is un-acceptable. the way we're farming, wild pollinators dont' do a thing for us (in california, anyway, which as you may know supplies 80 percent of the worlds supplies in almonds, a plant that requires pollination, and does not self pollinate) 

there are some simple steps landowners can employ to help the population of wild pollinators thrive, even away from the wild.

1. hedgerows. 

2. allow the edges of the fields to have at MINIMUM weeds. if not tree's, etc.

Can you help me build a better store?,9,4,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/environmental_science/comments/w0iqi/welcoming_ideas_big_small_can_you_help_me_build_a/,"The company I work for has been asked to design a greener grocery store for one of our clients. Grocery stores generally use a lot of energy and my boss has asked me what we should do, if we could do anything. It obviously needs to payback to sell to the client and if it saves money, all the better. The footprint is ~7500 sq ft.


Due to the profile (and confidentiality agreements) of the companies involved I can’t give out too many details but I’ll try give as much detail as I can. It’s being built in the high arctic. Think Barrow AK if you’re looking on a map. The town has 3 phase power but I don’t know if we can feed back into the grid (I doubt we can generate enough power anyways). We intend on using heat reclaim and 25 watt T8 or LED lighting where applicable already. The insulation will be beefed up as well. It’s being built on a triodetic because the land is pretty much a swamp. Water is trucked in. This store will have a lot of refrigeration but that’s going to be top of the line and as efficient as possible already so I don’t think we can improve there unless there’s been some breakthrough in the field in the past month.


I'm scared of geothermal because if it breaks there’s no one remotely close to fix it and it’s often -40 up there so we need to make whatever we do nearly bulletproof. There are some minor rebates for wind and solar and this place has months of 24 hr sunlight that we might be able to take advantage of. If anyone knows of a calculator I could use to break that down I’d love to have a look.

SO I come to the minds of greenit for ideas. What can we do to reduce the carbon footprint and energy consumption of this store? Nothing is too big or too small. If you can show an example of something that has worked elsewhere I’d love to see it! If this makes me look like a champ to my boss, don’t worry he’s surely going to steal all of the credit like a good boss should. He’s a good boss which is why I’d like to give him some great ammo to take to the client. I'd love to be able to build these guys a prototype store they can show off as having the latest &amp; greatest technology in it!

These policies can then range anywhere from federal laws like the CAA to local laws within Athens or Athens County, or even be suggestions for laws that should be passed within just Athens.

What I need help with is the section of which I am writing, dealing with Air Pollution and maintaining or increasing the level of air quality.

I understand some of what needs to be done to better regulate fracking in order to protect the health and safety of the people, but I need some more suggestions.

An example would be ""we need to update the Clean Air Act to lower permitted amounts and better regulate the release of volatile organic compounds."" the more specifics the better.

This is a project that I am serious about, and I will probably be sending a copy of this to the mayor before I go home for Thanksgiving, because our area is really in the midst of a goldrush of land-leasing by gas companies, so this info would be something really helpful for the city and population of Athens.

I have seen some schools offer an MS (not an MA) in Geography with a concentration/specialization in Biogeography, which matches what I would like to do precisely.  

My question is, is there any reason not to pursue the MS in geography when it is more tailored to my interests?  Especially when the departments, classes, and faculty overlap with the En Sci programs, it seems like this would be a better fit for me.  Are job opportunities for geographers working in conservation science out there? 

This may seem like a silly question for some, but I am concerned coming out the other end if the name/program on my degree will effect what I want to do or limit the opportunities after graduation (got burned with my undergrad, I don't want to repeat that!).

First post on reddit. I'm not sure if its taboo to ask for advice on your first post, I had a look around and didn’t see any subreddit FAQ/rules etc. My apologies if its is. 

I have recently quit my job where I worked in remote aboriginal communities in environmental health (I live in Australia). In this role I worked with traditional leaders, government bodies etc to help manage solid waste, investigate disease outbreaks, design water supply and management systems and a range of other projects. I conducted a human and environmental health risk assessment, sat on state wide steering committees and wrote state strategy etc. Having recently come back to the city I am not sure where to go with these skills. I don’t have a specialist area which seems to be a problem as big companies hire for a specialise area while my experience has been with identifying issues and figuring out how to fix them. I have been considering going back to university to do a masters course. 

My question is what areas have people specialised in and what was the reality of working in that area? 

I am looking at Environmental Impact Assessment and Management however from talking to people it looks like I’ll be doing 15min billable blocks (which doesn’t sound fun) and helping companies get away with doing as little as possible. Then in 10 years I’ll be getting lots of money.  

Thanks for any help.

so this goes out to those who work in the environmental field. what would you recommend i study? why?

i know people will say, what do i prefer, but honestly i dont mind. i like water technology, i like ecology, i like envionmental policy and law, i like suatinability, i like conservation, and even the prospect of working in an environmental consultancy is appealing to me.

but to those out in the world, whats the job market like in your chosen profession that derives directly from either field of study?
what is the pay like?
how enjoyable is it?

im not worried about having to work hard. ive always had a part time job for the last 6 years, and put my all into everything i do

I am a current community college student in the process of transferring to a large in-state university that is well-known for its environmental department. My primary interests lie in renewable energy (including design &amp; repair) and sustainable development (planning for food &amp; energy).

I think at this point a four-year engineering degree is out of the question, due to previous choices I have made with classes. My current mental conflict is between the other various routes that lie in front of me...

1) Pursue a ""hard"" B.S. in Enviro Science degree with a focus and/or minor in the more theoretical side of things.
2) Pursue a ""soft"" B.S. in Enviro Policy &amp; Planing or Enviro Econ. Management (both of these exist in B.S. form).
3) Pursue a two-year associates in electromech engineering technology with a focus in renewable energy.

Can anyone offer advice? My primary concern is that I will pursue one of these paths too hard and box myself in, so to speak (e.g. obtain the hard science degree and be unable to go into a more theoretical field). How can I balance all of my interests and leave the widest possible door open? As a side note, I do enjoy the hard sciences but would have to say that I see myself in a more theoretical position someday, unless we are talking about actually installing/repairing wind &amp; solar systems.

Currently I am trying to figure out what I should study for graduate work. I will explain what I would like to do, and then I will fully research your suggestions.

I want to be able to go to random villages, or small towns, or large farms, etc. all over the world. I want to take a look at their farming practices, and use of natural resources such as soil and water. I then want to figure out how to help them best use the resources in a sustainable manner, that will increase crop output, help people save money, and have clean water to drink. So essentially, I want to use Env. Sci. to alleviate poverty, troubleshoot environmental problems, and come up with solutions to ensure food and water security. 

I also may want to go on to a PhD. I am not 100% if this would alter what I would get a masters in, and I am not opposed to going straight to a PhD either. 

So dear friends, if you know of any programs that tailor to such aspirations let me know. I am aware that most programs have a Jan. 15 application deadline, but I do not want to just apply to some place because I can get in. I really want to tailor my education in such a way that I will have useful skills to help people.

My question to you:  in your experience, has a M.S. limited one's ability to pursue lab/field work?  On the other hand, has a PhD limited one's ability to pursue lab/field work?  Any information you can provide on study/career opportunities for Environmental Chemists?

As the title suggests, I'm considering a move to the US. I'm a 27 recent-ish graduate with a BSc Biology (Uni. of Brighton) and a MSc Environmental Science (double from Uni. of Copenhagen and Uni. of Vienna) with a 6 month contract at a marine research institute and a couple of papers under my belt. For the last year I have been desperately trying to find consultancy work (within environmental sciences/services) in either the UK or Denmark with no luck.
Seeing as I only have 6 months experience (+3 month internship at a forestry based company) and a 1 year gap on my CV - I'm interested in entry level positions. Also, residency is not a problem as I already have a green card. 

With highish rates of unemployment in the US, is it even worth (for a European) trying my luck over there? Would my MSc hurt my job chances with my lack of experience? How do you find out about smaller consultancies in such a large country? I'm very flexible geographically and will go to where the jobs are whether they are in central NYC or rural Alaska.

I'm currently only a first year applied science degree student, but I need to really start thinking about my two majors for next year. My first major is going to be biotechnology, as I've always been interested in it.

This is where you guys come in! I've also always been interested in environmental science. Now, originally, I was just going to choose either microbiology or biochem just because it probably fits well with my first major but I am able to choose environmental science. My question is: Would a mix of biotechnology and environmental science provide me with any real job opportunities, or would it just screw me over in the long run? My main goal is to become a researcher at either my university or an overseas institute, and becoming an academic.

Finally, I apologize if this is not the correct place for this. If you think it should be moved elsewhere, could you please point me in the right direction.

Anyway, if you know any of the answers or any good websites it would be greatly appreciated! Keep in mind that I'm pretty bad at science and only need a simple explanation :)

1. How do hydrogen and helium amounts change over time and affect the sun's energy?
2. What types of clouds signal a warm front? A cold front?
3. Where do storms, tornadoes, and hurricanes get their energy? 
4. What is the relationship between El Nino and the weather in Peru?
5. How do the ocean currents on both sides of the US affect our weather? (I'm assuming by ""our weather"" he means Colorado, but anything in the middle of the US should be fine)
6. How did the El Nino's affect the weather in the US this year?
7. What causes surface water currents? Deep water currents?
8. Why do people aerate their lawns?
9. Where is energy stored in nonrenewable potential energy sources? How is it released?

(Xpost from /r/gradschool),2,2,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/environmental_science/comments/1au3xl/backup_plan_for_after_environmental_science_grad/,"I will be graduating in May with a Master of Environmental Science, water resources concentration and so far I don't have a job lined up. My career interests are in water quality. I figured I would get some sort of field sampling tech job after grad school and work my way up from there, although I've been applying for a wide range of jobs including those I am barely qualified for. Despite applying constantly since last year, I've only interviewed for one position and didn't get the job (obviously). I started out looking specifically for government jobs, mainly state and local, and I just recently moved into applying for entry-level consulting jobs. I've mostly been looking for jobs in the U.S. East and Midwest.


Is there a good back-up plan if I don't have a job yet when I graduate? Should I start stocking shelves at a grocery store until I find a ""real"" job? My assistantship is my only source of income right now, so I will be totally without income upon graduating.


My advisor has proposed that I can choose to not graduate in May. That way, I can receive an $1800 summer stipend if I continue to take summer classes. Instead of receiving my degree in May, I wouldn't get it until August. I would prefer to not use this option, but I don't have any better ideas right now.


Any advice would be appreciated!


Edit: I should also mention that I did two full years of full-time internships in resource management at a national park between undergrad and grad school. I figured that would be decent experience that would help land a job (including one year of GIS experience), but no luck so far.",,False,self,t5_2s90l,1364003317.0,,,True,t3_1au3xl,http://www.reddit.com/r/environmental_science/comments/1au3xl/backup_plan_for_after_environmental_science_grad/,

I'm quite inspired by my surroundings (I live in Wales, U.K) and I come up with ideas on how to manipulate the resources, surroundings and the energy (mainly wind, but hey, we can try and get some solar in here given the right technology). 

I just wanted to share my story and make myself known here.
