Put on your most fabulous outfit.
Turn the fans on full blast.
Dump a vacuum cleaner bag in front of them.

2) Tear down your house, put it in a truck.
Drive 10 hours in any direction, put the house back together.
Invite everyone you meet to come over and party.
When they leave, follow them back to their homes, drink all their booze, and break things.

3) Pay an escort of your affectional preference subset to not bathe for five days, cover themselves in glitter, dust, and sunscreen, wear a skanky neon wig, dance close naked, then say they have a lover back home at the end of the night.

4)Buy a new set of expensive camping gear.
Break it.

5) Lean back in a chair until that point where you’re just about to fall over, but you catch yourself at the last moment.
Hold that position for 9 hours.

6) Only use the toilet in a house that is at least 3 blocks away.
Drain all the water from the toilet.
Only flush it every 3 days.
Hide all the toilet paper.

7) Set your house thermostat so it’s 50 degrees for the first hour of sleep and 100 degrees the rest of the night.

8) Cut, burn, electrocute, bruise, and sunburn various parts of your body.
Forget how you did it.
Don’t go to a doctor.

9) Don’t sleep for 5 days.
Take a wide variety of hallucinogenic/emotion altering drugs.
Pick a fight with your boyfriend/girlfriend.

10) Spend a whole year rummaging through thrift storesfor the perfect, most outrageous costume.
Forget to pack it.

11) Tell everyone that you’re going to a “Leave-No-Trace” event.
Shop at Wal-mart, Cost-Co, and Home Depot until your car is completely packed with stuff.
Empty your car into a dumpster.

12) Listen to music you hate for 168 hours straight, or until
you think you are going to scream. Scream.
Realize you’ll love the music for the rest of your life.

13) Spend 5 months planning a “theme camp” like it’s the invasion of Normandy.

14) Walk around your neighborhood and knock on doors until someone offers you cocktails and dinner.

15) Get so drunk you can’t recognize your own house.
Walk slowly around the block for 5 hours.

16) Tell your boss you aren’t coming to work this week but he should “gift” you a paycheck anyway.
When he refuses accuse him of not loving the “community”.

17) Search alleys untill you find a couch so unbelievably tacky and nasty filthy that a state college frat house wouldn’t want it.
Take a nap on the couch and sleep like you are king of the world.

18) Go to a museum.
Find one of Salvador Dali’s more disturbing but beautiful paintings.
Climb inside it.

19) Before eating any food, drop it in a sandbox and lick a battery.

20) Spend thousands of dollars and several months of your life building a deeply personal art work.
Hide it in a funhouse on the edge of the city.
Hire people to come by and alternate saying “I love it” and “this sucks balls”.
Blow it up.

21) Set up a DJ system downwind of a three alarm fire.
Play a short loop of drum’n'bass until the embers are cold.

22) Make a list of all the things you’ll do different next year.

That video was awesome, wasn't it? I don't know if you teared up, but I sure did.

Now, you probably thought to yourself, ""Wow, this place looks cool!"" Or maybe you thought, ""Who in the hell ARE these people?"" Or maybe you thought, ""What the fuck that guy has half of a mustache."" Whatever your reaction was, you are probably now curious and interested in learning more about Burning Man. Well, below are links that you can follow to some pages that we recommend every new Burner read. They are really useful, so much so that a lot of veteran Burners still read them every year before going.

[First Timer's Guide](http://www.burningman.com/first_timers/) - All of the basics.

[Survival Guide](http://www.burningman.com/preparation/event_survival/) - Some more in depth discussion of important points that some people might not consider.

[The Ten Principles](http://www.burningman.com/whatisburningman/about_burningman/principles.html) - These are the principles that our community is built on. Learn them well!

Larry Harvey just got off of a conference call with the National Weather Center and NASA.  They have confirmed that the conditions are going to be even worse then they are right now.

As a result several changes have been made to the event:

1) The theme has been changed to Atlantis

2) All art cars must now be seaworthy and carry life jackets for participants

3) Instead of burning with fire the man he will be consumed by a sharknado

4) The Daft Puck concert at the trash fence will happen on Tuesday instead of Friday (But the old tickets are still valid)

5) The Sheriff's office has asked for the Coast Guard to patrol the perimeter fence for people trying to sneak in.  (so good luck trying to swim past them!)

6) The DEA has brought in sonar equipment to search for drug submarines trying to get past the Coast Guard

EXPERIENCE FROM THE COMFORT OF YOUR OWN HOME

by Anonymous Enigma-McUnknown, Jr.

1. Read Dhalgren by Samuel R. Delany. Read The City, Not Long After by Pat Murphy. Cut off the bindings, throw all the pages up in the air, and shuffle them back together. Reread The City After Dhalgren by Samuel Murphy. Burn it. Read the ashes.

2. Pay an escort of your affectional preference subset to not bathe for five days, cover themselves in glitter, dust, and sunscreen, wear a skanky neon wig, dance close naked, then say they have a lover back home at the end of the night.

3. Tear down your house. Put it in a truck. Drive ten hours in any direction. Put the house back together. Invite everyone you meet to come over and party. When everyone leaves, follow them back to their homes, drink all their booze, and break things.

4. Buy a new set of expensive camping gear. Break it.

5. Stack all your fans in one corner of your living room. Put on your most fabulous outfit. Turn the fans on full-blast. Dump a vacuum cleaner bag in front of them.

6. Pitch your tent next to the wall of speakers in a crowded, noisy club. Go to sleep.

7. Lean back in a chair until that point where you’re just about to fall over, but you catch yourself at the last moment. Hold that position for nine hours.

8. Only use the toilet in a house that is at least three blocks away. Drain all the water from the toilet. Only flush it every four days. Hide all the toilet paper.

9. Visit a restaurant and pay them to let you alternate lying in the walk-in freezer and sitting in the oven.

10. Don’t sleep for five days. Take a wide variety of hallucinogenic/emotion-altering drugs. Pick a fight with your boyfriend/girlfriend.

11. Cut, burn, electrocute, bruise, and sunburn various parts of your body. Forget how you did it. Don’t go to a doctor.

12. Buy a new pair of favorite shoes. Throw one shoe away.

13. Spend a whole year rummaging through thrift stores for the perfect, most outrageous costume. Forget to pack it.

14. Listen to music you hate for 168 hours straight, or until you think you are going to scream. Scream. Realize you’ll love the music for the rest of your life.

15. Bust your ass for a ‘community.’ See all the attention get focused on the drama queen crybaby.

16. Get so drunk you can’t recognize your own house. Walk slowly around the block for five hours.

17. Sprinkle dirty sand in all your food.

18. Mail $200 to the Reno casino of your choice. (Raise your hand if you remember when tickets were that cheap!)

19. Go to a museum. Find one of Salvador Dali’s more disturbing but beautiful paintings. Climb inside it.

20. Spend thousands of dollars on a deeply personal art work. Hide it in a funhouse on the edge of the city. Blow it up.

21. Set up a DJ system downwind of a three-alarm fire. Play a short loop of drum ‘n’ bass until the embers are cold.

22. Have a 3:00 AM soul-baring conversation with a drag nun in platforms, a crocodile, and Bugs Bunny. Be unable to tell if you’re hallucinating.

If we did the same as ""Burners"", it could be a first step towards the legal right to get the week off as an unpaid holiday.",92,18,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/BurningMan/comments/ob3dt/in_2001_thousands_of_people_in_the_uk_and_other/,"[Here's the link to the Jedi story.](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk/2757067.stm)

I'm not sure if I would describe Burning Man as a religion but it definitely has many of the characteristics of one- a series of core principles, symbols, a pilgrimage, a global community built around a common identity, and shared values.

I'm not religious in any normal sense but I can honestly say that the most ""Spiritual"" experience I've ever had was with my girlfriend in 2008, when the man collapsed and we ran up as close as we could get to it.  I think a lot of people have a similar feeling towards the burn and this could form a legitimate basis for classifying Burners as a religious group.

I'm not suggesting calling Larry Harvey a prophet or any nonsense like that, I just believe that in its current form, Burning Man could fairly be described as the closest thing to a religion that many people have.  Just because it's not thousands of years old or have a ""God"" doesn't mean it can't be just as legitimate of a religion as anything else.  Buddhism doesn't have any sort of Supreme God in the usual sense.  I'd also suggest that many Burners adhere to a set of common values more closely than a large percentage of people who profess to be Christian.

Doing this would probably give the haters more to rant about but haters gonna hate.  The only thing I'd be worried about is if calling it a religion discouraged people from wanting to attend for the first time.  However, I believe that with careful communication and explanation of what we mean by ""it's a religion"", this could be avoided.

Obviously, calling yourself a ""Burner"" doesn't conflict with any other sets of beliefs you may hold.  I think the idea of Radical Inclusion would mean that people already part of a religion could still be part of this one.

Anyways, it's possible that this idea may have been proposed or written about before but I've never heard serious discussion about it.  Credit for the idea goes to my friend Bryan but after waiting forever for him to post on here about it, I've decided to write it up and flesh it out a little.

I'd like to know what people think.  I don't think it's definitely a good idea (it might even be a terrible idea) but I do think it's worth talking about.

edit- I'd like to add that the Jedi thing was more of a joke/atheist statement/fandom movement.  This would be legit.  The Jedi thing just provided the idea to list being a Burner.

edit2- There's a percentage of people downvoting (obviously expected, this idea is kinda crazy) who I think would be especially valuable to hear from.  There's probably a lot of problems with this that I haven't thought of so, if you dislike/feel iffy about it, please share!

1313178271.0,71,self.BurningMan,jh2gd,Burning Man tips for shy people- it's easier than you think. But still terrifying sometimes.,78,7,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/BurningMan/comments/jh2gd/burning_man_tips_for_shy_people_its_easier_than/,"Hi.
Are you shy? Do you have a hard time walking into a roomful of complete strangers and striking up a conversation? Does the idea of walking out of your tent in a crazy outfit strike terror into your heart? Cool, ok, you can work with that.

The dumbest mistake I made my virgin year was expecting the playa to entertain me. Expecting other people to reach out to me and draw me in. I was intensely shy, and didn't know how to interact with everyone. I had all the STUFF I needed to survive, except social skills.  

Burning Man isn't a spectator place, it's a place where you have to nut up and talk to people. It's full of 50,000 people who are more-likely-than-in-normal-life to want to talk to you, but they're still people. If you are desperately shy and walking around hoping someone will talk to you-- it might happen, it might not. But if you make an effort to talk to OTHER people, the results will be good. If you don't make an effort, you might be disappointed. And lonely. 

Here are some suggestions that have worked well for me. I've managed over 7 years at Burning Man to transform myself from a desperately shy person into someone who is less-shy and can easily talk to others. Most of the time. 

* Smile. Seriously. Shy people are sometimes seen as angry/aloof/haughty/unfriendly. Fake it until you make it, pretend you're outgoing. Yeah, it's terrifying. Do it anyway. Burning Man is a good place to practice.

* if you bring costumes to burning Man but then feel weird going out in them because you think people might look at you funny or judge you, tough shit, wear them anyway. No one will judge you, in fact people enjoy complimenting each other on costumes if they notice you at all. It's a good conversation starter. But no matter what, people are too busy thinking about themselves to think about judging you or whatever. You might FEEL terrifyingly like the center of attention when you step out of your tent in something that pushes your comfort zone, but you look pretty normal to everyone else. NOTHING is normal in BRC, so the weird becomes the norm. 

* Have some conversational starters. Not ""lines"", per se, but there's a few things I've found that most everyone wants to talk about. I have great success with asking ""what's the coolest thing you've seen today?"" or ""what's the best piece of art that you've run across?"" or the like. Everyone has wildly different experiences!

* Try an experiment where you let the whims of others dictate your day. Walk up to strangers and say that you're doing this and ask them for a destination suggestion or an activity. When they say something like ""go climb the Man base and check it out"" or ""go visit XYZ camp and do (activity)"", do it. Once you do it, ask someone else. Repeat. Have adventures. Or get distracted on the way. Whatever. 

* Go to an activity you find in the What Where When guide. You'll meet people there because you'll all be doing the same thing. It provides context, and context is a great way to meet people.

* Meet your neighbors in the next camps over. Bring a snack or a drink or just a smile. Ask where they're from, how their journey to BRC went. Let them know if it's your first time there, let them know that you're there to help if they need anything. They will usually offer their help too, and often a seat in their shade and a beer and an invite to sit around and shoot the shit for a while. 

* Go to the Volunteer table near Playa Info in center camp, and ask if they need volunteers anywhere. Many projects/departments need volunteers. I spent a lovely afternoon once learning how to custom-cut and install rope light. I learned a good skill, met some nice people. I also spent an afternoon working on shade cloth for the Airport, and a pilot gave me a ride in his plane afterward. Having a Job makes it easy not to be shy. 

* if all else fails and you feel desperate yet brave, make a sign that says ""I Am Shy"" and go hang out somewhere. People will come talk to you because, well, shit, we're all shy sometimes.

Now, having them isn't necessarily a problem - the playa is filled with things that can maim you - but I saw some people aiming them very low.

I wanted to just put this out there that if you see someone on the playa with a laser pointer about the size of a lightsaber and they are holding it at anything less than 30 degrees, please kindly remind them to be a bit safer. Nobody needs to get blinded.

He was the leader of the Mystikal Misfits, who have been building giant structures on 4:30 and B for the past few years. Many, many good times have been had in that camp.

In John's computer, we found his camp plans for 2012: motherfucker build ***a three-story castle with a fully-functioning drawbridge on the playa this year.***

This is after 2010, where he engineered a three-story ""hotel"" with an actual functioning elevator (which stole off the set of ""Dollhouse""), giving a whole bunch of wheelchair-bound Burners their first IRL aerial view of the playa.

This is after 2011 where, to compliment the ""Rites Of Passage"" theme, we decided our camp theme was going to be ""Moving Back In With Your Parents"" -- and John engineered a two-story suburban home, complete with sprinklers to water the ""yard"" and a ""basement"" where we'd welcome the playa to our keggers (aka happy hours.) 

So this year, we decided... we're gonna build that fucking castle for him.

We'll be posting images as we build, you can keep up with 'em here -- https://www.facebook.com/pages/Mystikal-Misfits-Burningman-Theme-Camp/375142658685

And for any LA-based Burners on Reddit, mark your calendars for Saturday June 30th. We're holding a fundraiser party to help get the castle built. It's gonna have DJs and snake-dancers and live figure-drawing; in honor of our fallen leader, we're calling it ""A Night In Lord Danger's Harem.""

I will choose a recipient Saturday afternoon.**

Here's the deal. I have an extra ticket to Burning Man, and I want someone wonderful to have it. Yeah, for free. It's a gift ticket, there's no monetary value associated with it.


I don't have a lot of time to volunteer this year, so my intention with this ticket is to give it to someone who will be a kind of proxy- who will interact and create fun and participate joyfully. Your smiling face will be my gift to Black Rock City this year.


There are no strings attached to this gift, but there's a small process in which I'll choose the person who will receive the ticket. I would highly suggest reading this whole post before emailing me.


PLEASE NOTE: I also value following instructions, and have no patience for people who do not do things with care and consideration. If this is important to you, you will take your time and make an effort. I'm not asking for a novel (I'm a busy girl), but full sentences, proper grammar and the like will lead to a more-positive response from me.


Here's how to submit yourself for consideration:

* send an email to oneburningticket@gmail.com with the subject line ""Burning Man Gift Ticket Request"".

* in the body of the email, tell me some things.


1) Have you been to Burning Man before? If so, why didn't you buy a ticket before they sold out? If you've never been before, answer that same question but tell me about your plans (monetarily and otherwise) to prepare for the playa. It's a lot of work and $, and the event is soon.


2) Why should I choose you? What participation will you bring to the playa? Any plans for making art or other interactivity?


3) What city do you live in?


4) Anything else you'd like to mention?


CONSIDERATIONS:

* I will choose a ticket recipient on August 4th, so be prompt. Any emails received after August 3rd at 8pm Pacfic time will be disregarded. Recipient of gift ticket will be notified via email.

* You will receive one gift ticket to Burning Man (either by mail, or local pickup if you're in the SF Bay Area), with no expectation that you do anything but come to the event. And, this would be nice but not necessary, come visit me on the playa and give me a hug and tell me how your Burn is going. I am not creepy and I am a girl. I will not grope you.


Have a nice day!

The short answer is it doesn't. The event will be dry. So don't panic.

The long answer is that during the winter and spring, the playa as drainage can remain flooded because there's a constant stream of snow melt from the surrounding mountains, little evaporation, and little ground absorption because of an icy water table.

But under current summer conditions the water will be gone in a couple of days and the playa will be perfectly resurfaced by next week. In that way this is a really good thing for playa conditions. Except where people are walking and driving and working on the wet playa.

Where people are agitating the wet playa there will be rough, chunky scarring. It's going to be terribly uneven, difficult to ride on on and turn to dust quickly after it dries as people crush the berms. We can hope the DPW building the city right now are taking steps to minimize their impact on the wet playa.

So where the playa is left alone, it's going to be harder and less dusty than usual, and this will be most of the ground surface at the event. We may get fewer large dust storms over the week due to less loose dust above wind of the burn site. Where the playa's been torn up while wet it will suck and produce dust.

Remember it's too far away to accurately forecast the weather at the event. There's no indication it will rain. My feeling as a local is that there's a greater chance than normal, but it's still pretty unlikely.

I'm here on playa, thought I'd take a moment off work to drop you a line. The playa surface is really nice in some parts, really shitty in others, and there's lots of sand dunes. Some places look kinda like the beach. 

Last night was apparently the 4th night in a row where, right after sunset, winds kicked up for a few hours. It was just HOWLING, and went PAST a whiteout apparently, to what's called a ""brownout"", where playa's actually getting scoured up and thrown around, rather than just the very superficial surface of dust. Fun times. It calmed down eventually. Drifts of dust are piled up against anything that's not flat, a few inches in some places. 

Drive safely and we'll see you soon! Everyone's hard at work building you a City. Man Pavilion is going up, the Temple's hard at work, the Pier is building away, Center Camp's busting ass, etc.

* A new Sheriff was elected recently. While many redditors have negative opinions of law enforcement, the new Sheriff is a positive thing for the event. 

* This is from personal experience.. we don't speed around in emergency vehicles just for fun. We have very strict rules on vehicle operations, and if we are heading somewhere and it seems like we're in a little bit of a hurry, it is for an important reason. We try to not kick up dust but sometimes it's unavoidable. If you see an emergency vehicle, please don't jump out in front of us and yell ""slow down."" (This has happened to me before while we were en route to a person having a seizure.)

* I know folks love the memorabilia.. but **PLEASE** do NOT steal the street signs! We (obviously) need the street signs to navigate. When the signs start vanishing, it makes it more and more difficult to locate patients. It's a city of 50,000 people in a harsh environment, and just like any other city, we need to get around. Stealing the road signs makes it a lot harder and delays patient care. 

Also, emergency vehicles are **NOT** art cars or a taxi service. We cannot give you a ride across the playa, and please don't run up and jump on one.

We're there to help you! ESD staffers are also Burners. We're not paid, and our services are a gift back to the community. We look forward to the event and are planning for it year round!  

Be safe. Help each other. But if you do need help, by all means, ask us! We love to help. :-)

I can see the potential for people to get offended, however Kangaroo balls are apparently one thing that are cheap and easy to get through customs, and after picking up maybe 6 million and 1 moopy cigarette butts last year I'd like to hand them out with a scowly look whenever I see someone throwing their butt on the ground.

**EDIT**: I think the original author is [""Jaygo Ishkabibble of Disorient""](http://www.reddit.com/user/wugmump).

(From what my *friends* have told me-- of course), numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 9 require particular attention in order to avoid potential disappointment out there.

1) don't assume you're going to get laid.

2) don't assume the drugs will be great.

3) don't assume you're going to be able to find drugs.

4) people will do drugs and get laid. if you can't deal don't go.

5) you will have a serious knock down drag out fight with whomever you go with. if your relationship can't handle it, go with someone else.

6) assume you will have a massive breakdown out there. if the person with whom you are going can't handle taking care of you, go with someone else.

7) don't fuck with other people's burn. people enjoy the event in different ways, and you need to respect that.

8) it's better to come overprepared than to underprepare.

9) sad but true: cute chicks have a better time. make sure you have at least one in your group, and if you are in a relationship with her, let her do whatever the hell she wants.

10) any art you bring, no matter how modest, is a good thing.

11) any tech art you bring will break. every tech you bring will break, actually. the dust will destroy it.

12) the dust is so much less oppressive than you think it will be.

13) you really need to bring something to hide yourself from the elements when there is a dust storm.

14) it's the noisiest place on earth. bring earplugs. and if your neighbor is banging techno at 5AM, you just need to fucking deal.

15) the beginning of the week is better than burn night.

16) burn night is one of the weirdest nights you'll ever experience.

17) don't fuck with the art car crews. they will cut choo.

18) make sure you bring nice things for the art car crews; befriending an art car makes the event a vastly better experience.

19) gifts are good things.

20) cheap crappy gifts that people will have to carry around for a while before they throw away are a total waste of time. a cold can of beer is better than a million crappy glowsticks.

21) make sure you are sufficiently lit for night.

22) make sure you are prepared for a full range of weather; be ready for 120 degrees during the day and freezing cold at night.

23) and make sure that the clothing you bring has lots of pockets and can handle the dust.

24) feel free to ignore all of this and come with an open mind. the event is simultaneously a frightening cliché and the best thing in the world. plan accordingly.

25) have fun!

Who would I recommend this experience to? And though I love my friends and family very much, I came back with this answer: Almost no one. I don't mean to be a downer, but I think we should have this talk. I really don't think that Burning Man is for everyone, or even most people. It's a crazy, very difficult experience. Yes, it can be rewarding and fun. But it takes a lot of work (at least it should if you're not a sparkle pony). 40% of this year's BRC population is going to be virgins, supposedly. While I don't think this is necessarily a bad thing, it does concern me a little. I can't say 'I hope you know what you're getting into' because nobody can really understand what Burning Man is like before they go. But I just want to say that I hope you are prepared to put in the work, Amish style. And get filthy. And not sleep. And strain relationships.

Ice: when you put ice in your cooler, put it in ziploc freezer bags. It makes things easy to layer and arrange. When it melts, it won't make a disgusting soup of water and soup bits. Plus, you can use the water from when it melts for washing, shower, or whatever. 

Cooler: You may have a great 5-day cooler. Want to make it extra effective? Get some of [this](http://www.acehardwareoutlet.com/ProductDetails.aspx?SKU=54113).  Measure and cut off a piece for the bottom of your cooler and the underside of the lid. It makes a difference!

By using the above 2 methods, I only had to get ice once during the burn!

Use a camelbak or other hydration pack as a ""Playa Pack"". Make sure it has a few pockets. Put things in there like:

lip balm, condoms, a small ziploc baggie for the used condoms (LNT), clif bar, sanitizer, small first aid kit with bandages and neosporin, lighter, sunblock, bandanna, a couple of extra batteries for your camera, small pad of paper and a pen (to get contact info for those awesome people you meet!). All this stuff is small and lightweight and useful! When you get back to your camp, immediately replenish whatever you used so that the pack will be ready fro you to grab and go next time you head out to the playa! Plus, you always have water!

Pack a couple sets of clean clothes in freezer bags and leave them in your car. When you get to that hotel and shower and are able to put on dust-free clothes, you will be so thankful you did this!

Bring a couple of throwaway sheets and wrap them over your car seats. When you leave, you'll be dusty. Also, when you turn on the A/C you may get a nice blast of dust!

Coconut juice! Get some, put it in your cooler! Amazingly refreshing!

Bring real food, not MRE's and/or Tasty Bites. I mean, if you want to bring a few, okay, but don't make them your mainstay. By day 2 or 3 you will be dying for real food!! Just cook some things up during the week prior, portion them into ziplocs, freeze, and put in cooler. Take one out in the morning and put it on the dash of your vehicle on top of a piece of foil. It should be nice and warm by the time you get to it later that day! Alternately, just bring a camp stove and boil in bag to reheat!

Bring a large sheet and cover your bed with it every day. That way you can at least get a couple of nights of relatively dust-free sleeping! It's far better than not doing so!

Hope this helps!",,False,,t5_2qj68,False,,,True,t3_j915i,http://www.reddit.com/r/BurningMan/comments/j915i/a_few_odd_burner_tips_youll_be_thankful_for/,

Here are my notes!

I liked the smaller turnout. Last year the playa seemed so packed at night with art cars, that it was hard to ride and enjoy looking around because of collision danger. This year I could ride fast, slow, and enjoy the trip, and take time to connect with individuals, instead of just being part of a big crowd. 

There was a lot of art. The core effigy number seemed to have doubled and they were fun and huge and fantastic. I think the core burn is great idea, and it's and come to mean a lot to me. We build and burn our own. And the Pirate Ship/Pier, AMIRITE?

I liked the weather- In hindsight. A whiteout is no fun when you're being battered in the face, but it kept me on my toes, appreciative of the clear nights and days that did come along. Hunkering down with strangers in funny hats, inside a ridiculous piece of art, sharing water and holding on to each other is unique, and I appreciate unique times. It forced us to change our plans and kept me out of familiar ruts.  Also, it never got too cold.    

I Really liked all the newcomers. I found them informed and all-in. I thought the crowd skewed a little younger this year, and didn't mind the energy. They pushed me to go back out and dance just a few more hours, because clearly, the party was Not Stopping. There was a touch of that ""Spring Break"" vibe, lots of college-age shirtless dudes with abs misting tutu-d co-eds at Distrikt, but for me it never got annoying. Everyone was having a blast and seemed to be able to Handle their Shit. Right on. I welcome next year's batch of Sophomores and can't wait to see what this year's inspiration makes them bring to next year. 

The music was very good this year. House House. Deep, Funky, Disco, Indie. SOLID. Dubstep was minimal, only on art-cars and a few camps. But Damn. Dat House. Opulent delivered and Roots was crazy. Smaller Camps like Want It and the Terminal also delivered killer vibes. The big-sound-art-cars knew what was up. Thank you to everyone who brought tunes. 

BURN NIGHT. WOW.
I haven't gotten this close to the man since my first year. I usually watch it from atop a cozy scaffolding in the distance. I'm so glad I came down this year. The  burn was huge. The human energy was explosive. Then the entire esplanade turned into a dance floor with hundreds of art-car DJ's. Unforgettable. 

For reference, I  was part of the Nacho Friends camp on the 3:00 plaza, serving hot cheesy chips daily at sunset. Our folks who towed the big camp trailer unfortunately had to leave before the weekend so we had to break camp a few days early. No weekend warriors will know we even existed. :p Also worked/DJ'd on the sinking ship art car. My Playa name: Poptart    

These are just my positive opinions. What did you really like?

(*Reposted, I am not the author*)

Greetings from the DPW Sign Shop! We're the crew that creates all the
city signage you see! From the ""Burma Shave"" signs' quips and quotes
(courtesy of Larry) to ""No driving on the playa,"" we begin our
production in mid-July and start putting them up as soon as the
perimeter fence is in. The signs are OUR art and the largest
installation on the playa!

It seems that every year, street signs are stolen earlier and earlier.
Aside from people needing these signs to find their way home, they are
CRUCIAL to our EMT staff. They use them to call for emergency medical
assistance. Imagine if you called 911 and had to tell them ""I'm by the
blinkie thing!"" We don't want anyone's wait for treatment delayed. We
create the signs to be souvenirs so stealing them isn't the problem; it's
WHEN you steal them! So PLEASE leave the signs up until the city is
disappearing!

As for ""alteration"" of signs, we'd like to ask that you embellish the
sign posts rather than covering up what's already there. ADDING signs
is far more creative than defacing someone else's art! And again,
covering up signs could thwart our EMTs.
We'd like to ask YOU to become a ""steward"" of your closest street
signs. OWN that intersection signage! Guard it! And then take it home
with you on Monday!

MUCH LOVE from the DPW Sign Shop, workin' hard at the Burning Man Work

On entry day 2008, my friends and I got our asses handed to us, and it made our whole burn.  We were forced to meet and work with our neighbors, which led to some amazing friendships, which led to a camp merger, which led to our current theme camp.

We grew in numbers in 2010/2011, when the weather was simply idyllic.  It was like a beach vacation, and all of our virgins accused us of exaggerating and trying to scare them.  

Personally, I'm dying to see them chase their tents, and eat with a respirator on, and drink dust, and pry grit out of their ears and nostrils.  I want a year where no one can stay clean, so they don't even try.    Am I alone on this?  Am I just sick?

Those of you who have done so, what major changes did you jump right into after the Burn?  How did it turn out for you?

I've been at my job for nearly 4 years.  There is a lot of job security in the type of work that I do, and I've managed to work myself into a great position.  I'm seniority in my department, and answer directly to the two VP's of the company.  They ask me about things in my department and seem to really listen and value my input.

Yesterday, I quit.  This change has seemingly been a long time coming, as I am unhappy working in an industry that essentially does a lot of damage and furthers poverty via preying upon people with less than savory credit.  That's not to say the company hasn't helped a lot of people out, as it has, but that's neither here nor there.  I was feeling very trapped in my position, trapped by my own level of comfort and false sense of security.

I saw and read the post about decompression tips.  The one thing that stood out most to me was the length of time suggested to wait before making any life changing decisions.  3 weeks.  Guess how long it takes to form a new habit?  About 3 weeks.  So essentially, I thought to myself, I'm to wait 3 weeks while my societal programming takes over again, so I'm reduced to another brain-washed, comfortably miserable drone before making any life-changing decisions?  But I'll be complacent and trapped!

My decompression process has been unbelievably hard this year.  I've found myself feeling completely alienated and alone, and lonely.  My job was making me even more miserable by the second.  I willed and willed and willed for an out.  It came, I JUMPED ON IT!  I start my new job a week from today, and even though I'll be making less money, I know I will be infinitely more fulfilled at the end of each day.

My job was my parakeet.  I divorced my parakeet.

And you know what?  I couldn't be happier.




**EDIT** For those of you asking, I work for a sub prime auto financing company.  I am in ""recoveries"", which just translates to being end of the line collections.  Not a very loved or fulfilling position, and most people who know me are quite shocked to learn of this position as it doesn't suit me at all.

Someone [asked about an AMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/BurningMan/comments/tatp3/ama_request_a_shirtcocker/) and I think I'm qualified! **PROOF** https://imgur.com/UWKWh

(For those of you new around here- I think Urban Dictionary's definition of [Shirtcocked](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=shirtcocked) is a pretty good summary of it, including the ridiculous stereotypes and hatred.)

If I had a shirtcocking resume, it'd read something like this: 

* I've been shirtcocking 4 years now

* I've done my best to one-up myself each year.

* Playa names have included ShirtCocker and Thelonious Barebottom.

Like all super heroes, I've got an origin story. I volunteer with ESD (edit- ESD is the Emergency Services Department- we handle fire, medical, communication and psych for the playa), and had been working (either in uniform or with a uniform in my camelbak and on-call) for about 4 days straight. Hadn't had tons to do, but was representing the department- had to be sober and professional. My boss is pretty big on cultural competence AND professionalism. The burn is one place you can't possibly do both at the same time, and the stress of it got to me. The first morning I got up and didn't have to work, I figured I'd have to do THE MOST UNPROFESSIONAL thing I could think of- which turned out to be shirtcocking. I didn't plan it that way, but I happened to step out of my trailer about 5 minutes before the managers' meeting started, in the dome about 50' away. So everyone from the department head on down to the supervisors got an eyefull. (My boss took one look at me and fired me. It was glorious.)

Anyhow, I ended up shirtcocking for a few hours that day. Since then, I've shirtcocked every year I've been on playa. I've tried to one-up myself each year. I don't remember exactly, but successive years involved a strap-on, stilts, taller stilts, stilts and a strap on, etc... 

Also, friday is Hug a Shirtcocker Day every year. I make sure to go out, and make sure people know, so they can participate- and I think that's where the glory of shirtcocking comes in. Shirtcocking is combining two totally-accepted clothing choices (clothed and naked), in the one way you're not allowed. It's as if the color green was banned- blue and yellow are ok, but to mix them? Oh, god! It pushes peoples' buttons for no reason, and I love that. There's something wonderful about it. 


As for questions- 

**Why not just go naked?** I think I've answered that one. 

**How does it feel being one of the most oppressed minorities in a subculture that espouses radical inclusion?**  IT'S FUCKING AWESOME! When my existence gets that much of a reaction, it's just magical. (With the caveat that it'd really piss me off if it was an all-the-time thing. To be able to step outside of the invisible norm is a lot of fun.) 

**What kind of abuse have you received?** Most people actually receive it pretty well. I don't get a lot of hugs on Hug a Shirtcocker Day, but most people recognize I'm trolling, and give it a grin. That said, I offered one guy a hug, and he looked like I had just pulled the flag of of his WWI-surviving great-grandfather and used it to wipe my ass on Memorial Day. It was FANTASTIC!

**What are your favourite pantless outfits?** Stilts, a shirt, and a strap-on! (See photo!)

**What did it feel like the first time?** It was great! People were soooo weirded out. I accidentally trolled the entire managers' meeting for ESD- approximately 30 of my supervisors and such!

**Did you practise at home in front of the mirror?** Nope! It just happened- but that's a pretty funny thought. 

**Uhh...maybe they're just slightly insecure and shirtcocking is a way that they can ease themselves into full nudity?** Nope. I also run around nude when I don't feel like putting on clothes. 

**Isn't the hate for shirtcockers kindof a joke anyway?** For most people, yes. Some people take it seriously, but for the most part it's just “awkwardhaha”.

“The only point I personally see in shirtcocking is ""LOOK AT MY PENIS, EVERYBODY! IT LOOKS LIKE A PENIS!""”  That is an important part of it, because that's where the squick-factor comes in. (Actually, that gives me an idea- I think I'm going to do some androgi-cocking this coming year- a T-shirt and flesh-colored spandex underwear. I think it might be even more strange than shirtcocking!)

Other questions? Hit me up!

While you're there I want you to pick someone you don't know. I want you to meet them, hug them, and I want you to remind them that their life, their journey, is their own. It's not their parent's, not their girlfriend's, not their husband's, it's not their sister's or brother's or even their friend's. It is theirs and only theirs, and they should own it.

TO FLAME BUSES NOT AUTHORIZED TO ENTER BLACK ROCK CITY IN 2013

Burning Man organizers want participants to know the To Flame bus operated by Rally Bus will not be granted access to Black Rock City in 2013.

Companies providing bus service to the Burning Man event are required to secure permits from Burning Man and the Bureau of Land Management. To Flame and Rally Bus have not secured these permits.

Additionally, Burning Man issued a Request for Proposals for a bus service to the event earlier this year. To Flame submitted a proposal, but was not selected based on gaps in their operational plan to support the event, previous track record and negative feedback about their bus service from operators and participants.

During the RFP process Burning Man advised To Flame to not sell any additional tickets. To Flame was not selected as the bus service vendor, but continued to advertise bus service during and after the RFP process. On June 26 Burning Man issued a Cease &amp; Desist letter to the company.

Participants have a few options for public transportation to the playa, including the new BRC-supported Burner Express bus service operating from the Reno-Tahoe International Airport and the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in San Francisco.

1376616492.0,39,self.BurningMan,1kgjq2,Car tips: Keeping your fluids cool and your car alive.,39,0,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/BurningMan/comments/1kgjq2/car_tips_keeping_your_fluids_cool_and_your_car/,"Your car was not built with the harsh drive to the Playa in mind. Be gentle with it on the trip. Read below for a few tips and tricks. IAMA a 7x burner and ASE Master Mechanic/Canadian Red seal Mechanic.

Tranny: No, not the sexually confused. 
Do you own an automatic transmission. Yes? You NEED an auxiliary transmission cooler. Pretty much every car out there has barely enough transmission cooling for around town use. Load up that car beyond it's recommended GVW, put it climbing a mountain in thin air where the cooling system looses efficiency and your oil will cook. The cooler you keep your transmission oil, the longer it will last. Beyond a certain temperature, you transmission oil life can absolutely fall off a cliff.

Automatic transmission fluid (ATF) lifespan: At 195F, it's 50,000 miles, at 235F, that drops to 12,500 miles. 295F, 1500 miles. 375F, 80 MILES!! Buy an aux. cooler and you will extend the life of your transmission+oil and have fewer transmission oil changes over the life of your car. Trust me, it's cheaper over time. Synthetic engine or transmission oils tolerates a whole lot more heat and performs far better under harsh conditions.

If synthetic oil is compatible with your car's gearbox (research this on google or ask the dealer), that is a nice upgrade. Even if not, a proper flush is the only way to get all the oil out of your transmission, as 70% of your oil is trapped in the torque converter. Look for a shop that has a flush machine that connects to the oil cooler hoses and exchanges about 12L out of your transmission. VW's are out of luck and use a water cooling system.

If you have a manual, good for you! Spill and fill that oil every 25,000 miles or so. Use the proper lube! Especially Hondas, get that factory oil. It's worth it. Cooling is not an issue.

Engine oil: First off, if you are anywhere near your oil change interval, it's overdue. This seems to be lost knowledge, but engines running in extreme heat often benefit from a slightly thicker grade of oil. Same goes for higher mileage engines. Read your car owner's manual for info. If you have more than 150,000 miles on your car, chances are it is smarter to bump up one grade of oil anyways. If you use 5w30, consider 10w40, especially if your car normally lives in a warmer climate. In winter it may be too thick. Don't put your old, ancient motor on synthetic as oil leaks can occor. It's been happy on dino juice, so leave it. 

Don't ever, ever pay for an engine oil 'flush'. It's a ripoff! You get all the oil out every oil change. Flush chemicals contaminate your engine and are hard on it. If you let your oil get really gross, consider doing your next oil change at half the mileage. That will make it spotless. Yes, you can stretch out intervals a little with synthetic.

Personally, I don't ever change brands of oil. I pick an oil, and I jiffy marker the product names and weights under the hood. Stick to them, it's a little secret to machines lasting forever. No one properly tests against buildup of everyone else's additives. In a pinch, the wrong lube is better than no lube, so use your brain.

Coolant: Is your coolant kinda murky? It's too late to change it. Do a last minute flush and you will clean all that dirt out that was holding your cooling system together. If anything is sub par, it will leak at the worst possible time.  It might actually be better to wait until your trip is done. You should have changed it a few months ago. Check your car carefully for leaks. The secret to a good cooling system is the ability to build pressure. Your radiator hoses should be rock hard once the car is at operating temperature. (squeeze them hot and cold to feel the difference). Higher pressures can handle higher temperatures. Your car might run fine around town, but you take it up a mountain and it will take a shit. 

DO NOT use bars leak or any other leak stopper that is a thick goo or aluminum flakes. You will plug up an already crappy cooling system. I personally use a water pump lubricant and minor leak sealer made by 'kleen-flo' that is a thin liquid and seals tiny pinholes only.

Your cars coolant will turn acidic after 2-5 years depending on the car and eat your head gaskets, heater core and radiator. It may even look clean and the oil change kid will say it's fine. Everyone is too lazy to check PH now. It is YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure you follow the recommended change interval.

If your car gets warm, turn off your AC, roll down the windows and run your heater. That extra bit of heat coming out if often enough to keep things from melting down. If your gauge climbs all the way up, pull over before it hits the red, pop your hood and KEEP THE CAR RUNNING unless you are puking out coolant. Stop the cooling system and the temperature really spikes up. If you are off the end of the gauge, shut it down and wait awhile. A 30 min wait can save a $4000 motor.

Is your car running hot while overloaded, but everything is working properly? I found a product out there called 'watter wetter'. It's a thin pink liquid made by 'red line' oils and we used to use this in hot rod motors in the desert. It is good for an honest 10% efficiency boost to your cooling system. It works by filling in all the little microscopic holes that water molecules are too fat to fit in. It can make all the difference between your temperatures slowly climbing up on the hills or maintaining. A must for an RV or towing application.

Don't forget you may have a differential and a transfer case in there too. Don't change dark (but not black) brake fluid before a trip. Again, fresh fluid will clean that dirt and brake failure has a higher chance of happening. Do change it when you get home. 

Read your service manuals and the recommended maintenance intervals from your dealer (important!) for when to change all your fluids and the recommended intervals. I will tell you that current transmission oil change intervals got larger with no engineering changes from the manufacturers. They just decided to increase the intervals to make cars 'less maintenance intensive'. I drop 4L out of my transmission every 25,000km (15,000 mi) and add some fresh stuff. It stays spotless and red. Do it at the newer longer intervals and it's suspiciously dark already. Add a transmission cooler and you can probably hit that interval.

When you get your dealer recommended maintenance guide (free at every dealer), you will be following the 'extreme service' guide for your trip to the playa. 

Finally, before you leave, and when you get home, pay for the extra under car rust protection/wax at the car wash. I pressure wash out my engine compartment and clean the crap out of everything when I get back. Playa dust is corrosive and is hard on things.

My questions are:

Do I need to find friends to go with or network before going for safety/security reasons? I'm perfectly content hanging out with myself and making friends as I go, but I don't know if things like sexual assault are common.

What is the camping situation like? Do you have a designated space or do you just pick a spot, park your car, pitch your tent, and call it done? If there are designated spaces, do they cost additional money?

Is there cell phone reception at all in the area (specifically Verizon)? I'm assuming not, but I guess it wouldn't be impossible.

And any other information you think would be helpful for a female considering traveling alone (or just general helpful info not covered on the BM website) would be wonderful!

Until today, a friend of mine who's going keep asking me to go and tell me that i can def get tickets via craiglist or something.. and it got me thinking of going...then i found out he doesn't want me to go with him.

His reason was that it's something that he wants to experience on his own.  he wants to see if he can do it on his own.  he wants it as self growth experience.  (but he's wanting to meet up with local BM group to meet new people and learn more himself and possibly ride share)  so I already don't quite understand the logic.

Later on in the discussion, he went on saying how he thinks its not my thing.  I openly said that i would go. and who knows if i'll hate it or not. and i will never really know if i go.  He went on saying that he doesn't even want to go with someone who 'might' hate it.  

i thought BM is about sharing/community/giving/unselfish.  or am i really not understanding here?  am i being unreasonable to think that it's f-up that he doesn't want me to go with him.  is he being selfish or am i....

We got through an easy gate, got out to 9:00 and B to drop off ____ at his camp. On the way through, we told my kiddo he couldn't get out of the seatbelt because we didn't want any problems from LEO, which had been conducting stings everywhere before and after gate. 

We were unloading gear, and he asked if he could get naked. My kid likes to be naked. We said sure. 

We finished loading and began rolling towards 9:00, then turned right so we could roll out 9:00 to J, to park and sleep, ready for a good Tuesday. My kid was carrying a 1000 candlewatt flashlight. He hopped up on the front of the art car (it has a built out bumper) at the Tokyo post office. He was helping direct traffic around us- we could barely move. One short distance later, we were passing the med station at 9:00, where a host of Pershing Sheriff's were standing. 

About this time I told him to get down, cause he was freaking out the Sheriffs. They walked after us (we were rolling a very slow pace) and told us we were 'parading him in front of pedophiles', that we were pedophiles, that nakedness was for adults, etc. 

We waited for about 2 hours while they ran our backgrounds, plates, called a supervisor, etc. They implied that if we were clean we'd get some sort of warning.

Then they arrested me for child endangerment, a gross misdemeanor, and took me to Lovelock. Our friend was given the truck to drive away, after the boy got his stuff. He was taken to a CPS room at 3:00 med station where he waited for his stepdad to come from California to get him - about 11am the next morning. 


I spend the night in Lovelock and paid $885 to a bail bondsman on a $5600 bond, and I'm back to face charges in October. Bail bondsman gave me a ride to 447, and someone picked me up in 5 minutes with an open front seat, and I rode back. I had credentials rather than a ticket so re-entry was no problem. I filed reports with LEAL and ACLU, slept the night. On Wednesday, I saw some people, and after dark I drove to California to pick up my son. Drove home. No burn for either of us.

And for those who will say, ""ERASE THIS IMMEDIATELY"" - the facts aren't in dispute. What's in dispute is whether his presence on the front of the truck constituted potential physical harm:

Context:

I registered for tickets on the advice of a friend and got two. One for me, one for him. I've never been before and thought, what the hell, registering couldn't hurt (I have a feeling this happened A LOT). The only reason I'm actually in a position to go is I'm quitting my fancy corporate job around that time.  


       
The truth:  

Initially, I didn't know anything about burning man, literally anything at all, except that I could afford the tickets. In the last week I have come to learn quite a bit, about the history, the composition of the event, the principles and the ethos. Even still, I was planning on being a 'tourist', checking it out and moving on with my life.

Then I figured I should hear from some vets, so I found this subreddit (ive been on reddit for a while, so I knew there would be one, but delete my account every few months in a fit of self loathing about the wasted time).


So after reading about the phenomenal cluster fuck that is the ticketing process, and seeing how upset and hurt so many of you are, it no longer seems right to just visit and leave. And yet, I don't feel bad enough to dump my tickets into STEP (corporate training and whatnot)


So, how do I contribute to the event besides bringing shit and giving it away? My big concern is I'll contact some camps to offer my help and will be hated because I stole a spot from someone more deserving. I'm thinking I should wait a few weeks, for the fervor to die down, but then if I do that, some group might not have had the time to plan or whatever.


I'm a mid 20's able bodied male that's handy with a hammer and can afford to contribute. Open to any advice.

1313742985.0,38,self.BurningMan,jnoz3,FYI Active SCAMMERS in San Francisco - Details to watch out for!,38,0,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/BurningMan/comments/jnoz3/fyi_active_scammers_in_san_francisco_details_to/,"
Within the past week I have personally met up with BM ticket scammers in downtown San Francisco, and I noted several details about their fake tickets. They are selling very close to face value (around $350), and asking for nothing more than cash. Two black males, one average-size guy in his early 20s, and another fatass who looked a few years older. Fatty had a huge wad of cash in his pocket and was obviously the man behind the curtain. The palms of his hands were rather pale for a black dude. The smaller guy was the one who posted tickets on Craigslist so he did most of the talking. His alias was ""Aaron"". 

Long story short I didn't trust the deal so I didn't buy, but I spent a fair amount of time examining the tickets. I know the properties of real ones because my roommate who came with me has purchased a legitimate ticket from a fellow Burner, and we compared them side by side. Here's the scoop: 

1. Overall print quality is decent but still way grainy compared to the highly detailed print of a legit ticket. Colors are also not saturated enough. 

2. The paper it was printed on is nearly twice as thick as a real ticket. The surface is a bit glossier and sticks to your finger a little. Real ticket has a fine smooth matte surface. 

3. The shiny holographic regions have incorrect patterns (although the one on back side is quite similar), and they rub / scratch off the paper easily. 

4. Font used for ""Burning Man Black Rock City ...etc"" at the top and bottom holographic portions of the back side is totally incorrect. Real font is a square-ish design. The fine print covering the middle is just reproduced from a scan, so the font matches properly but the letters are kind of fuzzy. Fine print on a true ticket should be super crisp. 

5. The embossed circular seal has fake 3D details; it's a printed illusion. There is an overall circular impression which makes it seem embossed, but that's all. Your fingertips will NOT feel the detailed texture you should expect. 

6. The barcodes either have difficulty scanning, or in my case, they didn't scan at all! I tried with a smartphone app which worked just fine on a different barcode. DEAD GIVEAWAY: If you are examining multiple tickets and they have the same code, they are obviously clones of each other! Every real ticket has a unique code. 

These scammers are moving around SF; they might conduct the sale anywhere between Sunset and Downtown. Some others have posted on Craigslist saying they were ripped off by the same guys. Those victims may not have known what to look for, so I want to spread the word out to prevent further cases and to help bring them to the authorities. I have further leads which I researched on my own that I can share as needed (as I already have), and I can also provide more critical details from my own encounter.

I walked away with vital knowledge but of course without the tickets I needed. I hope that by sharing this knowledge with all of you, we can win the battle against these criminals! I'm still looking and hope to score an honest deal, and I wish the best of luck to all others wanting to go Home! Thank you.

It sucks when plans fail to materialize.  We can only expect the number of tickets for sale to rise exponentially over the next week and a half, so, in order to avoid clogging the front page (or being lost because no one commented/saw your post), please post your ticket sales here.

Some tips:

1.  Burning Man barely sold out last year.  There are 10,000 more tickets available this year, and a lot more tickets sold to virgins, who are realizing that they aren't ready to spend a week out in the desert.  Know in advance there isn't much demand.

2.  Post pertinent information.  Will call or paper.  If paper, then add your location.

3.  What kind of ticket it was.  Camp ticket, STEP, lottery, ect.  If it is STEP, you can't transfer it, so don't bother trying.  Low income tickets aren't transferable either.

4.  You aren't going to sell at cost unless you find a really altruistic buyer, and even if they are, everyone is broke.  Craig's list has tickets for $100.  It is too late in the game to think about getting what you paid for.  Your cheap ticket might just give another broke burner a chance to go.  Thanks in advance for the gift.

5.  One option is to take your chances and sell a ticket on the road.  I saw three people begging for tickets last year, and I wasn't even looking.  I am sure there are more, and they might even have a few bucks to compensate you.

Buyers:

1.  Confirm that the ticket is valid.  Here is the [list of voided tickets](http://tickets2.burningman.com/info.php?i=3815).

2.  Here is the [will call name change form](https://secure.inticketing.com/namechange.php?nug=burn).

3.  Use paypal if at all possible.  You can get a refund if you get scammed (and please post details about the scammer, not defaultia details, but reddit name, so we can ban them).

4.  Get your ass packing.

Not gonna, like, run a contest or anything, I don't want to make a big deal out of it. But redditors, yay. Come to Burning Man. 

Lemme know what's what. I have ticket in hand and need to get it to somebody by next Tuesday. I'm in SF Bay Area (SF/Berkeley), can hand it off, or drop it in the mail to you priority mail if you're not local.

I'll pick somebody tomorrow, but I kind of went into this thinking that maybe one or two people would chime in. I didn't know any other way to figure out easily who needed a ticket, or would have just pinged someone here in /r/burningman offline and handed it over. I apologize in advance to those of you whose hopes I'll be dashing, but is better to have hoped and lost, etc etc? 

EDIT3: Thanks to everyone who let me know they were looking for a ticket. I've decided upon someone to gift it to, after puzzling about it, checking reddit comment histories, poking around. Couldn't figure out any other way to do it aside from just who smelled good, as it were. I'm not going to out this person, they can mention it if they choose to.

The rest of you: I hope you make it to the playa. Please check Eplaya, Craigslist, etc., there's lots of face-value tickets floating around. HUGS!

The gate opens in 34 days! That's right - we're almost 1 month away. I'm sure you're already crazy busy, but I'd like to encourage you to add one more thing to your todo list: build a swamp cooler.

As you all know, tents get pretty hot after about 8:30 AM. For those of you who like to rage all night, you know that this makes it difficult (impossible?) to get much sleep. This will be my 7th year and it wasn't until last year that I finally solved the ""holy fuck my tent is an oven and I'm cracked out and I can't sleep and everything is terrible and fuck this shit"" problem. My solution involves shading my tent from the sun using [aluminet](http://octopup.org/burning-man/info/aluminet) to prevent the solar oven effect, plus actively cooling my tent using a swamp cooler. This combination allowed me to sleep soundly from ~8AM - wheneverthefuckIwokeup PM every day.

These are the instructions I followed: http://burningman.rengeekcentral.com/swampcooler.html

Done properly, swamp coolers use very little wattage and consume relatively little water. I ran mine for 4-5 hours during the hottest part of the day pretty much every day last year and it consumed about 3/4 of a gallon of water per day. I estimate that it only pulls about 20 watts, too.

(It's important to remember that swamp coolers aren't magical panaceas - there are plenty of other things to consider like the volume of air you're trying to cool, whether you  have proper ventilation in your tent, is your tent in direct sunlight, etc. - but if you've nailed all of these things, you can bring the temp. inside your tent down to a much more manageable 75-80 degrees F during the middle of the day!)

Srsly, build one. You'll thank me. Here's a [picture of mine] (http://i.imgur.com/kNVXv.jpg) to get you started.

Keen beans. By now you probably know how much water, food, and EL wire to bring. You hopefully have a prototype shade structure worked out (at least in your head), blah blah blah. You will survive. That's awesome.     



    

    
So what should you go and do/see once you get out there? I have some suggestions of things that you shouldn't miss, and I bet the greater burnit community has loads more! So here are my suggestions on how to get the best non-tourist burning man experience:


    




-Wear your finest, most elaborate costume for the entering ceremony. When you drive up from the road and reach the gate, the ""greeters"" will ask you if you are a virgin. Don't lie! They give virgins a special burning man hug, and will teach you one of their secret handshakes if your attire is elaborate enough. 

    
-There is a camp where everyone wears red jumpsuits. I think they're called 'The Humane Society' or something like that. If you see someone walking around in the playa with a red jumpsuit, or you happen to pass their camp, put on some bunny ears or a tiger tail and give them a wave! 


    
-There is one camp that does a really soothing evening meditation session called The Thunderdome (though as an ironic anti-consumerist statement they refer to their camp as 'Hot Topic'). Be sure to seek out this camp. They give great one-on-one spiritual healing sessions-- just walk into their big geodesic dome and tell one of the camp members you'd like to participate in the ritual. Incredibly relaxing.

    

I'll add more tips as they come to me... How about you guys? Any other vets with some good protips for noobies?


    


*Kamakiri has reminded me about the amazing bacon quiche served at center camp, every morning at 6am. It's first come, first serve so get there early. 
    

*Also there are several caches of premium beer placed in coolers and buried just below the surface along the trash fence. I don't know who buries them (certainly not the DPW), but they're up for grabs for whoever finds them. Just walk along the perimeter and look for a purple dildo staked into the ground. Then dig. Last year I found several bottles of Arrogant Bastard, year before it was Duvel.

I wore glasses my first year, and I generally found it to be a pain in the ass - they'd gather a film of dust after a few minutes, it was hard to find good goggles that would fit over them, it makes it hard to wear sunglasses, etc. So for the past 5 burns I've worn contacts, and here's what I've found:

* **Bring one-day disposable contacts**. It is really, _really_ hard to properly clean reusable contacts without leaving invisible traces of dust/sweat/sunscreen/martini/lube on them, and trust me, your eyes will notice.
* Bring a minimum of 2 pairs of contacts for each day you'll spend on playa. I have about a 70% success rate (ie. I end up tossing about 30% of the contacts I attempt to put in), so you need to account for spillage. You may also find yourself changing them more than once per day.
* Goes without saying, but: wash your hands reasonably well before opening your contacts.
* **Never** touch the inside of your contacts with any part of your skin. I don't care how much you think you've washed your hands - they're still too dirty. Even brushing the inside while cleaning or unfolding your contact will probably ruin it. [Here's a handy guide](http://i.imgur.com/f05TpSI.jpg).

Getting dirt on the outside of your contacts should obviously be avoided, but it's not the end of the world - your eyes are pretty good at washing that side. Getting playa dust on the side that makes contact with your cornea, however, **will** ruin your contacts.

And of course, bring a pair of glasses for figuring out where the hell your contacts are when you wake up!",,False,,t5_2qj68,False,,,True,t3_1cctqm,http://www.reddit.com/r/BurningMan/comments/1cctqm/tips_for_wearing_contact_lenses_on_the_playa/,

Now that the golden spike has been driven, it's time for my annual playa dust rant. Please don't ask people at BRC to update you on the dust. It's dusty. In years when it isn't as dusty, it's dusty. In years it wasn't so dusty you still brought goggles and masks and vinegar and sunscreen and your shower. In years it was extra dusty you brought the same stuff. The years they told you it was extra dusty you still went. The years they told you it wasn't dusty you still went. Some years there were dire warnings of worst dust ever and it was lovely. Some years there were cheers that it was nice and not dusty and it was dire. And for many of those trips your good and/or bad times were not necessarily caused by the level of dustiness or non-dustiness. So let me just tell you, in advance, to STFU about dust reports, and go to the desert, and have a great time. BTW, It's going to be dusty. It's always dusty.

I was reading on another web forum today and someone who's first year was 2011  said *""Yeah, the playa was hot but the weather wasn't that bad, I don't know what all the horror stories are about.""*

**The playa was on it's BEST BEHAVIOR this year**.  We did not have a dust storm at any point during the event week. We did not have a wind storm or any kind of adverse weather during the event week.  We had beautiful days and warm nights. It was as perfect as it ever gets.

Every year is not like this.  There are 12 hour dust storms with 60mph winds. There are below freezing nights or night time dust storms where you literally cannot see your hand in front of your face even with a head lamp.

Please do not get complacent. Plan for the worst but hope for the best!

It'll also shake out anything that needs to be fixed on your bike (do you need a seat pad? Raise the handlebars? Is your seat in the proper position? Do your brakes need adjusting? How's your kickstand- does your front basket full of bullshit tip over your bike every damned time?). 

Also, start getting in the habit of drinking water. Same thing- if you increase your water intake now, you won't be peeing like a racehorse your first day or two on the playa as your body adjusts. Remember to supplement with electrolytes! Gatorade or Emergen-C if you must, but there's way better stuff out there. I'm a fan of Vitalyte (their fake grape flavour is good, if you like fake grape!).

My name is Johnny. 2013 will be my first Burn, and it's been a long time coming. To give you some back story, my older sister went to Burning Man every year, for about 6 years. She absolutely loved it. It was amazing, as a teenage boy growing up, watching Sarah get ready for her trip every year. She went every year until 2001, when she was taken from us, as she worked in the south tower of the World Trade Center, and never made it out alive after the attacks. I was 16 when she died.

Ever since then, I've told myself that I wanted to go to Burning Man. I wanted to experience what she loved so much. She was such an unbelievably positive woman and she, quite simply, was my hero. There isn't a day that goes by that I don't think about her. I want to honor her by going this year, and sit in the Temple and tell her that I finally made it.

Here's where you guys come in- my intentions are good behind going, but I'm worried that I won't fit in. I'm not particularly artistic, I'm a copywriter for an ad agency (which I know doesn't jive with the Burning Man spirit), and above all, I'm a really shy dude. Really shy. I always have trouble talking to people I don't know. By all means, Burning Man will be shoving me outside of my comfort zone. But, I know Sarah would have wanted me to go and experience it, and I can't wait. 

So, my question is- will I be ok? I'm worried that I'll get there and just not fit in, and not know what to do, and that scares me. What can I do to mentally prepare? How can I become brave enough to jump in?

Thanks so much guys- I can't wait to see you on the Playa, hopefully. 

All the best,
-Johnny",,False,,t5_2qj68,False,,,True,t3_19flx6,http://www.reddit.com/r/BurningMan/comments/19flx6/help_me_be_not_scared/,

1342459153.0,31,self.BurningMan,wnhoi,Make your cooler into a tiny seven day refrigerator. ,36,5,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/BurningMan/comments/wnhoi/make_your_cooler_into_a_tiny_seven_day/,"Hi there, I've been reading this sub for awhile and haven't seen this advice posted here. How to turn a regular cooler into a mini refrigerator using dry ice, water ice and some extra insulation. If you hate dealing with things like melty ice in the bottom of your cooler, use this method and your ice melt will be super minimal. 

Keeping things cool is all about efficient insulation, normal roto-moulded coolers use a layer of air between two layers of plastic for insulation. Air is a pretty good insulator, but we can enhance this insulation with careful packing and a couple of extra items. 

You need:

* ~10lbs Block water ice for each cooler you pack in this way

* ~3-4lbs Dry Ice for each cooler

* cardboard 

* reflectix bubble pack insulation (enough to line the inside of your cooler)

* tape, either that foamy double sided or some duct tape 

* a thermometer if you're really anal about knowing what temp your food is at.

* A pallet or a couple planks to set your cooler on

* Some shade at burning man

***

Do all this right before you're ready to go and you have all the food you'd want to pack up. 

**Step 1:** Get your shiny bubble wrap and cut pieces to line the inside of your cooler, so get a square that fits in the top, the bottom and all four sides, stick that on with your double sided tape or rolled duct tape. This creates a bit of radiant barrier for your cooler, and adds an extra layer of insulation too. 

**Step 2:** Layer up your dry ice on the bottom, then block ice on the top. The dry ice will freeze what it comes in contact with, so you want your dry ice to keep your block ice frozen, but you don't want your dry ice coming in contact with your food. The water ice will insulate your dry ice to keep it from sublimating too quickly. 

You can just take your blocks of ice and stick them in your cooler or you can use ice forms and smaller chunks of ice to get a tighter fit. If you use cube ice, you can spray it with a bit of water to freeze it into a solid chunk. I would **avoid** completely encasing your dry ice in water ice, because that seems like a recipe for explosions. 

You need about 3-4 inches of water ice between your dry ice and your food to avoid it freezing solid. But you can also leave a little gap in your your block ice layer to slip a carton if ice cream into for later. Your camp mates will probably think you're some sort of wizard if you can produce ice cream in the middle of the week from a hidden compartment. 

**Step 3:** Don't stick your food in yet, first take your cardboard and place a layer or two on top of your ice, another layer of insulation to keep your food from touching your ice. Then pack your food in as evenly as possible. Throw a thermometer in there so you know how cold you stuff is throughout the week. 

**Step 4:** Go to burning man. 

**Step 5:** Once you get there, store your coolers in the most shady part of your camp, and place them on a palette or some boards so they're not directly touching the ground. 

That's it, enjoy well refrigerated food for the rest of the week. ",,False,,t5_2qj68,1342467654.0,,,True,t3_wnhoi,http://www.reddit.com/r/BurningMan/comments/wnhoi/make_your_cooler_into_a_tiny_seven_day/,

(I work a lot, so I don't get much time to actually go to the event while there). 


* Three years ago, I set an intention to finally ride on a smallish art car (big buses don't count). I'd gone 7 years without actually getting on an art car (became a point of pride after a while, ha). Sure enough, an art car drove by and DEMANDED that I get on and go tool around with them.


* Two years ago, I set an intention to actually go out dancing for an evening at a big sound camp (don't like big sound camps or dancing). Happened, but wow that sucks. Fascinating people-watching though. It's like a whole other Burning Man! I put on furry leggings and everything, and got roundly mocked by my camp. DESERVED IT. 


* Last year, I decided to find an English dude to whisper filthy nothings in my ear. (That one was PARTICULARLY fun!)


* This year, it's to find poutine on the playa. I've never tried it, and everything's better at Burning Man, right? 


It's always fun to set just ONE thing you want to accomplish, either big or small, but something that'll set you out on a particular adventure or a quest. Do any of you do anything similar? If so, what've been yours? I know some folks who set a DAILY goal, but....I'm too busy for that.

*""2011 provided two compelling reasons to change how tickets are sold: a challenging ticket launch day, and then, our first-ever sold-out event. Before the Man even fell in BRC, we got busy with a deep examination of our processes and technology - and of new ideas, some of them straight from your feedback - to figure out how to provide successful, smooth ticket sales in 2012.*

*The big news: tickets to **Burning Man 2012 will be offered via a lottery system.** This solution offers a two-fold benefit: it eliminates the annual ticket sales rush by spreading out registration over time (no more sitting in ""line"" all day, no more getting kicked out of the queue, no sudden unwieldy server demand!) -- and it begins to address the challenges of scarcity. We are also intent upon creating a balance of opportunity across a few months time.*

*We'll have more details coming very soon (including deadlines and prices) but here's a summary of the major changes to how tickets will be obtained:*

- You'll first register for the ticket lottery during a 2-week open registration period. At that time, you'll declare which of the pricing tiers you'd be willing to pay, and provide a valid credit card number.
- After the registration period, we will run separate lotteries for each ticket tier. If your name is selected, at this point your credit card will be billed, and you'll receive a ticket confirmation.
- There will be several consecutive lottery rounds.
- You will only be able to purchase tickets from one lottery
- Yhere will be a limited number of tickets per person
- Ticket fulfillment will be held until early summer.

*And YOU, JRS subscriber, will be the first to receive information and get a chance to register! Coming up soon, we will be announcing full details, pricing tiers, dates of the registration period and lottery round announcements, and of course a big fat FAQ.*

*PRE-SALES: We also announce the return of a limited Pre-Sale, timed around the holidays. These ""pre-sale"" tickets will be offered at a significantly higher price than the very lowest tier of tickets; they'll also be sold via a lottery system. (This also affords a chance for us all to experience the lottery program with a smaller subset of ticket buyers before the main rollout begins.)*

*REDUCED PRICE PROGRAMS: We continue to welcome and support attendance for lower-income participants, so we will be overhauling the Low Income and Scholarship ticket programs in 2012. The two similar programs are being merged into one, to create a hybrid that will retain the best features of each -- and serve more people, since we're also increasing the number of these tickets that will be available.*

*The JRS and http://tickets.burningman.com should be your primary source of information over any Facebook page, twitter feed, locker room or water cooler chatter"". **The first registration will start before the end of November.** Read your JRS regularly to be informed.""*",,False,,t5_2qj68,True,,,True,t3_m9ab4,http://www.reddit.com/r/BurningMan/comments/m9ab4/preliminary_ticket_information_from_jrs/,

1312172661.0,30,self.BurningMan,j5dom,Anxious first-timers: relax,32,2,79,http://www.reddit.com/r/BurningMan/comments/j5dom/anxious_firsttimers_relax/,"For those of you who are heading out for your first burn and are starting to stress out about packing and preparation: relax.  Everything works out on the playa.  Except for the occasional fall-through at Thunderdome.

- Take a tent.  Non-mesh is generally best.  Your tent is your place of solace from the blowing dust, and mesh doesn't help with that at all.  Everything will wind up covered in playa no matter what you do, but a closed tent surely helps keep that to a minimum.  I'm a big fan of simple dome tents.  They're easy to set up and tear down, and if you really need to shake out the dust, you can unstake it, pick it up, and dump it out.

- Take food.  Don't get crazy grand ideas about cooking elaborate meals out there unless you're part of a reasonably large camp with a kitchen and plans for communal dinners.  I pretty much live on off-brand spaghetti-os and the like, straight out of tin.  I'm not in it for the food, and I'm not in it to make more of a mess for myself to clean up.  I track down enough moop out there that I'm not gonna add to the work I have to do.  Dried fruit, granola, crackers, and so on are great.    Don't take anything that needs to be refrigerated.  And somewhere on the playa, someone is giving out bacon.  At all times.  

- Take water.  Lots of it.  I shoot for about 1.5gallons/day, but I sweat like crazy.  If you don't have to pee, you're dehydrated.  Remind your campmates to down a bottle of water before they take an excursion, and be sure to carry water with you when you leave camp.

- Shade + seating: Shade's a great idea.  The sun is pretty relentless out there.  Unfortunately, shade structures usually make great sails in the wind.  Make sure you stake yours down *well*.  If you're soloing or really up a creek, don't panic.  All of your neighbours will have shade structures.  Make friends with them, take over a bottle of booze, and hang out with them during the day.  Camp chairs are great, comfortable additions to life in camp.  Even better if they have cupholders.

- Showers: Don't bother.  They're a pain in the ass, you have to pack out all of the grey water, and you really won't give much of a fuck when you're out there.  Baby wipes are fantastic for a quick cleaning refresher.  Also look for the Human Carcass Wash for an all-hands cleaning experience and keep and eye out for the water trucks spraying down your street.  They go by a couple of times a day and lots of people are always running along behind them getting a soak-down.

- Trash:  Take several empty 5-gallon buckets (from the hardware store, etc) with you.  They're great to pack in, and you're always gonna want someplace to tuck something around camp.  Also, they're hella useful for packing out your greywater.

- Lights - you don't need much in the way of flashlights, etc away from your own camp, although it's nice to have *something* when you need to make a 4AM porta potty run. Everything is pretty damned bright at all times. What you DO need is to be visibly, obviously illuminated from all sides at night. Art cars and people on bikes - it turns out it hurts a lot when they run over you.
EL Wire, LED blinky things, and ever glow ropes are great, but the disposable nature of glow sticks and ropes makes them a little suboptimal out there.

- Bicycles are a real nice to have out there.  A beater, 0-3 speeds, with fat tires.  Hell, you don't even need brakes.  Don't take your daily rider.  Any bike you take out there will never be the same when it comes back.

Remember: You're going to be surrounded by 50,000 people who, at least temporarily, give a shit about you.  You will be taken care of.

Oh - and perhaps most importantly, carry a cup with you at all times.  Something you can hang on your belt.  All will be well.

1309382306.0,29,self.BurningMan,icngm,My BM list of resources...,32,3,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/BurningMan/comments/icngm/my_bm_list_of_resources/,"Hey guys... I've had a pretty extensive list of resources and information for Burning Man for a few years now so I thought I would share with you.  Please feel free to share your thoughts and links as well!!! The more the merrier. :)

Oh, and I'm a girl, so most of the clothing links are geared toward chicks. Sorry Guys. :-\ lol


**Costumes -**
Costumes are typically the first thing people think about when they think about Burning Man.  The best way to think about it it is sexy/funky over ""costumes"".  Creativity is king and that can mean many things from taking something from your ""every day"" closet that you won't wear again and gluing/sewing fur or funky fabric onto it, making your own costume. 
 
Another key component to costumes at BM is accessorizing: jewelry, fishnets, eye lashes, pasties, scarfs, gloves, wigs, etc are great ways to take a good BM outfit and make it GREAT!  Sometimes simplicity is good but BM is bigger than life so more can certainly be better in most circumstances.
 
In a typical day it is not uncommon to wear 2-3 outfits per day: you will have your around-camp clothes, maybe one or two outfits during the day and then your night outfit.
 
Many people forget about night costumes. It can get brutally cold at night with temperatures down into the 30's at where ski gloves and fur coats are worn for survival.  Having at least one option for pants is a good idea and bringing a fitted long sleeve shirt or other layering pieces are not only easy to pack but they can come in really handy
 
Don't forget you may need a few pairs of pasties!!  www.pastease.com is one of the best sites for pasties.

Where to start with costumes - look at pictures of past BM years.  Go to the BM website and look at the photo gallery sorted by ""people""  you will see endless ideas of costumes.
     
Don't be afraid to try and make your own costumes - a little fur and fabric glue can make the hottest and most versatile BM costume.  Under the Supplies section there is a link for a fabric store that has decent prices on faux fur - hartsfabric.  Keep in mind that making costumes with faux fur can be time consuming (and a little messy) but really worth the hassle when you get out to the playa and slip it on.

Another tip I have for outfits is that I figure out each outfit in DETAIL prior to the trip to burning man. I write on a piece of paper every single thing that goes on that costume (purple shiny shorts, metal star necklace, yellow flower pasties, etc), then take the entire thing and put it in a gallon zip lock baggie. I also name each outfit something stupid mainly bc it helps jog my memory later which ones I was particularly fond of based on the name.  Plus, if two outfits share the same part, it makes it easier to label on the list (ie, ""purple shiny shorts from *Purple Nurple Flower Power*""). Not only does bagging your outfits keep them dust-free until it is time to wear them, but your tent is going to be **fucking HOT** during the day and you are going to want to spend as little time as possible in there. Meaning you will not want to spend time picking out your outfits.

**NOTE: MOST OF THESE SITES ARE NSFW**

**Getting to the playa -**
Plan on traffic getting onto the playa.  It's only 110 miles from Reno but getting onto the playa may take you anywhere from 2 hrs to 6 hrs depending on the traffic and your vehicle (RV's will travel much more slowly than an SUV).
 
We typically don't like to stop on the way to the playa but if you're up for it get a road-side taco! YUM.  Some people prefer to get gas in Gerlach, which is the city right outside of Black Rock City, just in case the trip home is a long one.  Getting gas here is a good idea; you will NOT want to stop for gas on your way back into Reno after the burn - it could add an hour or more onto your trip depending on traffic. 
 
If you are a first timer to BM you will go through the Virgin Process, which I won't tell you about since you should experience it without any impressions, but you will want to make sure you have your camera out when you pull up to the gates.  You only get to be a BM virgin once - embrace it!
 
**Setting up your camp -**
Whether you are part of a small camp or a large organized camp there are things you will want to keep in mind when setting up your individual part of the camp.  Most people make their way onto the playa as the sun is setting and more often than not you will be setting up your camp in the dark.  If you keep your initial camp set up as flexible as possible the first night you can more easily make adjustments the next morning when you can better assess sun, shade, etc.  Remember, the way you set up your camp can literally make or break your BM experience. It's worth taking the extra time to set up your camp well the first day.

* Sun - the sun can be brutal in the morning, especially after a long night when you may want to sleep in.  Take note of where the sun will rise and set and try to position tent where larger things will help shade it if possible. If you are camping near RV's that is ideal because they make great day-time shade structures though make sure you don't place your tent near the RV's generator or exhaust since folks in RV's tend to run their AC's during the day which will blow into your tent. Yuck.
     
* Shade - definitely plan to bring something (tarp, parachute, etc) to make your own shade structure.  The most simple way to make shade is to tie down a tarp across two cars parked next to one another.  The winds can be VERY powerful and this method is effective since so that your shade structure doesn't fly away - a very common occurrence at BM.  Put your cooler and food in a location (in a shelter of some kind (tent/or car) that is in the shade for a majority of the daytime.  
Another good shade option is something called Aluminet:
http://www.greenhouses-etc.net/equipment/aluminet.htm
     
* Chairs - don't forget to bring something comfortable to sit on.  You will be sitting on a bike for 70% of each day at BM when you get back to camp you want a comfortable place to rest your hump!! Our camp literally bought couches at a thrift store which we store in Reno each year, but we like being as comfortable as possible.

I'm only going to cover the parts that relate to ticketing. I am not going to link to the video as it is password protected and there is an indication that it should not be shared freely. However, I feel it is fine for me to share notes on what is being said.

 -------------------

- Introduction of Harley DuBois (Fairy Godmother of Themecamps). She talks from here on

- This is not a press conference

- Acknowledgement of those virgins in attendance who are bringing a theme camp

- Notice that a blog post, JRS post, and mutant vehicle announcement are going out.

- They have a plan (applause).

- If you aren't up to speed on how we got here, please go to the blog

- We are not going to have an open sale. We are taking the 10,000 tickets and giving them back to the volunteers first. They have already gotten a post to buy at $395. For volunteers who have come year after year.

- Next group is placed theme camps and mutant vehicles. 10000 tickets will be allotted.

- Surprised by demand.

- Found out with the lottery that they have a lot more people who wanted to come than expected. There is a supply and demand issue.

- Stressing the community as a whole

- Community cannot survive this (*mumble*) you to make this event happen.

- 10,000 tickets isn't going to solve that problem completely.

- We are going to be offering some themecamps tickets at the 395 level. One ticket per person. It will be the people needed to make your camp happen.

- Criteria to judge which camps are going to be getting tickets: first of all ten principles, history (no tickets to people who haven't been recently nor first time), community benefits (an expansion on interactivity, also inclused behind the scenes help to BM and the community), LNT (demonstrate effectiveness in LNT).

- Strategic distribution of your core members. Consider how hard it is to set up, how hard to run, how hard to take down your camp. We are giving preselected people ability to buy tickets.

- We hope that tickets will loosen up. People not afraid to say ""hey, sorry, I won"" (audience laughter), and more tickets on the secondary market. No idea how much.

- Theme camps to fill out by March 8th. Know it is a rush. If you make mistakes that's okay. Doesn't have to be perfect, we have time.

- If you don't get it right now you can go back and fix things later. If you want to be considered for these tickets, put in the form as quickly as possible.

- If you know people who are not coming to burning man, it will free up their tickets. So encourage them to contact BM to free up those tickets.

- Low income tickets will be after theme camp tickets, and they will cross reference the low income list with the theme camp list to make sure no duplicates.

- The person filling out the questionnaire needs to be comfortable talking about who gets tickets.

- Don't think there was an widespread issue with scalpers. Mostly just that we have such a great experience that we have too many people trying to get tickets.

- Something about having a global community, and this pushes us to it.

- Questions and Answers:

- Q: We are getting a blog post, so we don't have to text all our camp members (audience laughter). A: yes, and there is more information in the blog.

- Q: Is there any consideration doing it based on early arrivals? A: Yes, that is what we first looked at. Q: What was the reason that wasn't used? A: We didn't go solely on early arrivals because a lot of people have important people to setup their camp and other people to run their camp. An example is a bar, bartenders might not be part of set up and tear down. Then on the other side there is tear down. That's why it's not solely on that. (audience applause)

- Q: Do you think the demand was artificially high from people getting friends and family to enter, and what about next year, and can people give input? A: We totally want people to give input. We are starting an advisory board with a representative from each part of our community (art, theme camp, a general camper, an expert on gaming systems). Probably more forums too.

- Q: Can you explain a little more about how camps are invited? A: The camps that will be invited have already been selected. We know who we are offering tickets to, based on the data we have.

- Q: They won't be informed until after...?  A: We will inform them as soon as we get your questionnaire in and we are humanly able to get to it. If you get it in tonight, maybe in 48 hours you could be getting an answer.

- Q: Has any consideration been given to unlimited ticketing this year? A: We cannot because of our relationship with the BLM. More importantly, the 10 hour wait times/traffic situation is already intolerable. Q: At this location, but if you made the decision to go with unlimited ticketing, that implies somewhere else. A: We have looked for other places for the last 10 years and haven't found one like this one. Q: Were we ever so much in trouble as this year? A: That's true. Q: Maybe those sites look better now. A: They aren't better now, but maybe there are opportunities we should be exploring. Q None of that would be for this year? A: It's too late, there's not enough time.

- Q: How many theme camps are we expecting. A: I don't know. Q: I thought you said you selected them. A: Oh, of the ones that we have selected that have tickets right now, it's probably less than 50% of last year. Q: So maybe 500, in that range? A: That's a safish kind of number. Repeat for the phone: how many theme camps can we expect to benefit from this process, the answer is less than 50%.

- Q: Will you only be accepting (registration) for preapproved themecamps, or the smaller themecamp...? A: Oh we want everyone? Q: And does that give priority? Q: The only priority is that if you have tickets you know you are going to be placed, but you won't know where you are going to be placed.

- Q: (can't hear) A: Yes, this is not a perfect system. We've had discussions about it, but we don't have an answer for that one.

- Q: How do performers or presenters get tickets. A: There is a small number we are putting aside for ""other things"" and performers are part of that category. Q: Is that in the questionaire? A: That's separate. That's theme camp only.

- Q: Will it be possible to stagger when people arrive? A: Don't have a perfect answer. Q: (can't hear) A: When you have perfect weather for a temple burn on sunday, and you don't do it anyway (audience laughs).

- Q: In the short term, how can we become part of the people who make these decisions? A: Be a part of the conversation. We are opening it for dialog.

- Q: Are the numbers chosen already? A: Yes, it's based on what we know about.

- Q: Are villages treated differently than theme camps? Q: Save that question later. Allocations based on percentages of volume of camp.

- Q: Was there some kind of weighting on the general lottery. A: No, it was completely random.

- Q: Is the 40% newbie number real? A: My feeling is yes. We won't know until everything is done.

- Q: What's the criteria for core members? A: It's based on early arrival, and then what we've seen and what we estimate it takes to run your camp and how many it takes to take your camp down.

NY Times, LA Times, CNN, etc. It's everywhere!  All explaining the ticket fiasco and hinting that Burning Man will never be the same, if at all in the near future.  blah, blah, blah.....

What if all this news is turning off the newbies, too?  All this talk about how there won't be anything there.  All these camps, that probably had lots of friends who are burgins, are saying they aren't coming now.  The sounds camps, (my god!) all saying they are out.  No distrikt, no Opulent, no Bass Camp, the list goes on.  With nothing (big) to dance to, you think the raver kids who come in for the weekend will care anymore?

What if this is all such a turn off, what if so much doubt for an event they have never been to (let alone have to spend 1000 - many thousands to attend), many decide to not come?

WE know what awaits us.  They do not.

I have this feeling we are going to see a LOT of tickets return to the fold.  The bad press and negative feelings might have a silver lining. 

Hang on kids! It's always a bumpy ride on the playa.....  and it usually works out.

1328248682.0,25,self.BurningMan,p8x1m,Ticket update from BMorg Board Member,28,3,57,http://www.reddit.com/r/BurningMan/comments/p8x1m/ticket_update_from_bmorg_board_member/,"Got this from the lamplighters mailing list.  Thought I should pass it on.

--------------

From The SFBG : UPDATE (5 PM): LLC board member Marian Goodell just returned my call and said the organization leaders huddled up today to work on solutions to problems raised by the ticket shortfalls. ""We're genuinely really putting our heads together today. We're listening, we really are,"" she said. ""It's very real for us, I get it.""

She recognizes that it's a big problem for established theme camps and art collectives having tickets for only about a third of their members, a figure that she also confirmed. ""It's clear that the theme camps and art projects are a significant part of the community, and this situation is causing problems for them,"" she said. ""That's the part that will hurt us if we don't take another look at this.""

Goodell also acknowledges that it doesn't appear there are as many tickets available within those established burner networks as she had hoped would be the case: ""I doesn't look like camps are sitting on a lot of tickets."" But she also said that she doesn't think the lion's share went to scalpers. ""We don't think there are 10,000 people out there looking to scalp tickets,"" she said. ""Putting them up for sale is not the same thing as them being sold."" She reiterated her appeal that people don't use scalpers for tickets but wait for community-based sources and solutions.

But Goodell said it was too late to re-do this week's lottery -- ""not possible,"" she said -- even though the physical tickets won't be mailed out until June. She said the LLC has divided up information-gathering tasks now and will regroup soon to decide how to proceed, with options including tweaks to the rules for the March 28 ticket sale or working with the BLM to bump up the population cap, an option that would raise other problems.

""We have many different challenges: scalping, community development, and population,"" Goodell said, reiterating her concern that increasing the population would make logistical problems like the long exodus wait even worse. But whether that's even a possibility will depend on the Environmental Impact Statement that is expected to be completed in March.

1350791727.0,26,self.BurningMan,11tw8t,Already deep in prep for next year,36,10,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/BurningMan/comments/11tw8t/already_deep_in_prep_for_next_year/,"In the past, because of the way I approached Burning Man my first time (decided to go two weeks before the event, convinced a burner friend to go one week before the event, spent about $100 on top of ticket and gas, all very last minute), I've never done any prep more than a couple of weeks before Gayte, and I've certainly never done anything beyond wrapping a bike in el-wire in terms of actual camp-related work.

This year, I'm not letting go of the spirit of the Playa.

With the exception of the first weekend after Burning Man, every weekend since, my campmate (and a couple of prospective virgins) and I have been working hard on camp construction for next year.

That first weekend was spent unpacking, sorting, and repacking camp and essentials; if it were just the two of us going again, we could roll out immediately, needing only food, water, and a dozen or so AA/AAA batteries.  Lights, ropes, tents, coolers, rebar, monkey hut, shade structure, first aid kit, etc are all stowed, bucketed, inventoried, and ready to go.

We're going playatech-mad this time around.  To date, we've built:

2x [Love seat](http://www.playatech.com/index.php?deptName=04Radical%20Seating&amp;prodDesc=01Playa%20Love%20Seat) - surprisingly stable and robust!  We've modified one into the [Anniveraire chair](http://www.playatech.com/index.php?deptName=04Radical%20Seating&amp;prodDesc=02Anniversaire%20Chair), but take note: The slot location in the arm(s) for the cupholders is *way* too low.

1x [Plantry](http://www.playatech.com/index.php?deptName=03Bare%20Necessities&amp;prodDesc=06Plantry) - Not sure we'd do this one again; we've unconvinced of its utility now that it's up.

1x [Bike jack](http://www.playatech.com/index.php?deptName=07Desert%20Delights&amp;prodDesc=03Bike%20Jack)

1x [Black Rock Bar](http://www.playatech.com/index.php?deptName=05Rapid%20Entertainment&amp;prodDesc=01Black%20Rock%20Bar) - this thing is *amazing*.  It's *rock* solid and has TONS of interior storage.  

1x [Gear Gizmo](http://www.playatech.com/index.php?deptName=03Bare%20Necessities&amp;prodDesc=09Gear%20Gizmo) - more robust and stable than it looks!

1x [Teensy table](http://www.playatech.com/index.php?deptName=03Bare%20Necessities&amp;prodDesc=04Teensy%20Table) - in fact 3 tables from one sheet of plywood.

That's about all we're going to manage before the rains set in.

The total materials cost for all of that is (@ $20 per 1/2"" and $30 per 3/4"" sheet) about $180 + a $5/sheet donation to the Black Rock Arts Foundation.

For anyone thinking of making any playatech furniture, no piece that we've built needs to take more than about an hour to build once you're comfortable with a jigsaw.  The single most valuable piece of it (apart from the saw itself) is a T-square, which I didn't buy until last weekend.  That sped things up many, many times over.

That leads to the more indoorsy crafts:

One of our virgins is a professional seamstress and clothing designer; she made us amazing custom [vests](http://i.imgur.com/uvnLP.jpg) and skirts/blankets.  Now that she's been convinced that coming with us is the **best idea ever**, she's working on a series of robes and hoods for us, including wiring channels for lighting it all up.  Awesome :D  I'm working on lighting rigs for her designs.

Another prospective campmate - non-virgin - is working on digital interfaces to some vehicles which we're in the process of mutating; a golf cart and somewhere between 2 and 5 motorized wheelchairs.

1376506289.0,25,self.BurningMan,1kd6d7,Quick article regarding alkaline playa,28,3,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/BurningMan/comments/1kd6d7/quick_article_regarding_alkaline_playa/,"**Abstract**: The black Rock Desert, located approximately 100 miles north of Reno, contains a dry alkali lake that is a remnant of Pleistocene Lake Lahontan.  The annual event, Burning Man, is held around labor day when approximately 50,000 people camp on the dry lake bed.  Due to the high pH and desiccant properties of the ""playa,"" people often spray vinegar on pieces of clothing, equipment, flesh, or anything else that needs cleaning.  It is the contention of this author that the buffering capacities of the playa is are overcompensated by the festival goers when using copious amounts of vinegar for cleaning.  The amount of the assumed hydroxide ions were titrated in 100mL of a 11.5% slurry of playa against 6M HCl to a pH of 7.12, utilizing 43mM [H+] per 11.5g of playa.  While the playa is indeed alkaline, the buffering capacities is quite low.  

**Methods**: Playa was collected from sweeping out a mutant vehicle and tent that has been used for multiple burns.  11.5g of collected playa was suspended in a 250mL beaker with 100mL of 18.2 megaohm•cm MilliQ water.  The suspension was stirred vigorously for 10 minutes with a stir plate at 23C.  Four 50µL aliquots of 6M HCl were added to the stirred brown suspension after the initial pH reading of 9.17 was taken.  After adding 200µL of 6M HCl, the pH settled around 7.12, which was considered neutral for the purpose of this experiment.  

**Discussion**:  The main problem I have with people using vinegar to neutralize playa is that the pKa of acetic acid is 4.76, or 2.24 units away from pH 7, which is almost the same number of units away from neutral as the natural pH of concentrated playa in water.  pH buffered solutions or wipes should be utilized first, thus why topical ointments and cleaners often site a '""pH balanced formula."" 

Due to time limitations and fear of other people asking what I was doing, this experiment was far from complete.  After pouring out the brown playa suspension in water, there was a considerable amount of insoluble material.  While the addition of acid perhaps dissolved some of the playa, the majority of the material did not dissolve.  Further experimentation will utilize a vacuum oven to determine the amount of the assumed conjugate acid that was converted from the playa that went into solution.  Molecular and elemental analysis unfortunately were not available.  

Another topic not touched by this article is the desiccation properties of the playa.  It is from the authors empirical evidence that the playa has considerable desiccation properties that have yet to be quantified.   The particle size might also aid in getting into cracks in the skin causing more desiccation and irritation, but the charge on the particles could also be aiding in this.  Moisture tests will be performed on future samples when the operator doesn't have to be Shady Mc Shaderson in the lab.

Today was not your day.
You're stuck in the bay, yet
we’re off and away!

You have piss in your mouth.
You have bile on your keyboard
You have poison pen letters
drafted for each of the org.
You'll be on your own, surrounded by bay area fogs,
And YOU are the guy who'll be feeding our dogs .

You'll look up and down E-bay, and search the craigslist,
And were our dreams shat on too, we'd probably be pissed.
With your head full of tits and your ears craving dubstep
you're too smart to go wait or believe in “STEP”

And you may not find any scalpers
whom you'll want to trust,
If home is what you seek, then suck it up
You must.

It's awesomer there
than stuck home with you

And Out there hot chicks can happen
and frequently do
to people even lamer
and douchier as you.

And when ticketed friends brag,
about techo and glitter hoes.
Don't bitch on facebook
While we’re away just poison our grows.

You'll start plotting too.

OH!

THE LENGTHS YOU'LL GO

You'll be emailing all lists yet all out of luck
you’ll be some chump, some hippy fuck
You'll log back into to tribe, myspace and spam the facecunt,
You'll join 99% on their fruitless hunt,

YOU HAVE TO GET THERE,

Where else can you participate and share,
your gift of love to BRC and
wash raver goddess’s minge hair,
(thursday 12 – 4pm no fat chicks)

Wherever you try, you'll try all the tricks
You may even try to join us self entitled pricks.

Except that you couldn't
Because, probably, you shouldn’t.

I'm glad to say so
and, gladly, it's true
coz our lanes are already
full of people better’n you.

You’ll harass Logan, Kristy and Pole
Name drop Crimson or some other entity.
you’ll blow dan dasman, but alas it’s too late, your dream of this year has been randomly allocated
to a scalper in some east coast state.

You'll calm down from ALL CAPS POSTING
GRRRR
And find that things often do
Happen to people as lame and douchie as you

You will come to a point where the hope fades and your cards are marked.
the hot hippy chicks are in, But in Reno you’re Parked.
Time to go home, or try,
How hard could it be
Do you dare to stay out? Do you dare to go in?
How much do you hate to lose? How much do we love to win?

And IF you go in, should you turn at 12 mile or approach from Traego...Or go around back and sneak in from behind?
Simple it's not, I'm afraid you will find,
for a mind-maker-upper to make up his mind.

You can get so confused
that you'll start in to race
down long plastic orange fence at a break-necking pace
and grind on for miles across weirdish wild space,
headed, I fear, toward a most useless place.
point 1

...with people just waiting.
Waiting for a hippy to make their day
amid war Cries of Seaaaaaadaaaaawwwwwag
you’ll yearn for the bay

And the chances are you’ll find,
some hippy yellow bus

with Oregon plates, and unwashed ingrates.
you’ll search for a space
hide under luggage,
But alas dear reader, Gate, we rummage

Everyone is just waiting.

Waiting for the line to move
or waiting for will call to improve
or waiting around for lost hippies to find their car
or waiting, perhaps, for the window to roll down,
or waiting to be ordered from the vehicle by a weary looking clown,
or a line to form, or tickets presented
or a rummaging hand to find a passenger neglected,
or cupboards opened and fridges checked.
Everyone is just waiting.

yes!
That's not for you!

Somehow you'll be caught after all that waiting and staying.
You'll be taken to the bright places
where the bleachers are baying, where all souls wait to witness your shame.

With jolly roger flying,
once more we’ll ride high!
glad of our victory under the sky.
Ready because you're that kind of a guy!

Oh, the places you wont go! There is fun to be done!
There are hot chicks to be scored. there are beaver eating contests to be won.
And the magical things you can’t do with this first week of fall
will make you the douchie-est lamer of all.
lame! You'll be lamous as lamous can be,
with the whole of PGE will be watching your fall.

The second person I told reacted similarly, only more depressed than angry. I wasn't even overly excited either, I just mentioned it in passing. I feel somewhat guilty being excited. 

The third person I told offered to buy it from me for $1000.

These are people I have camped with in the past and would consider friends... o.0

I was able to finally connect with some others planning to go and share a bit of excitement but I still feel like my ticket is something I need to keep to myself.

Just wondering if anybody else is having really mixed feelings. I know this year is going to be crazy wicked different amazeballs :) and I personally welcome the change! Time to stir the gene pool!

**Instant** smile followed by a giggle.  I actually *giggled*!  ME!  The guy who has been moping around for the last couple of weeks pissed off at everybody and hating the world.

GIGGLED!

""Hello Campers -

The current ticket shortage has hit us very hard.  We are writing to encourage you to register your camp, even if you are short of tickets.  Thanks to those of you who have been sending feedback, suggestions, and hard figures and data around the current ticket shortage.  What's encouraging is the community is, after the initial ""@$##!!"", pulling together, and some ticket needs are slowly decreasing as camps gage their own ticket inventories and work toward redistribution. Please 'hedge your bets' and register.

If you haven't yet, please read the blog post from February 3rd here: 
http://blog.burningman.com/2012/02/news/burning-man-addresses-2012-ticket-situation/

In a nutshell:

""Burning Man’s most important priority is to make sure the community stays intact in the face of the current challenges.""

The ticket shortage is impacting theme camps, mutant vehicle projects, and also Burning Man's core volunteer infrastructure. The majority of our volunteer staff of our departments have always purchased their own tickets.

With that commitment in mind, we want to encourage you to register your camp, though it appears currently that you do not have enough tickets for even your core people. We do not want you to miss the opportunity to register your camp, should solutions to your ticket shortage appear after the April 26th Placement registration deadline. The Placement questionnaire goes live in nine days: on Wednesday February 15th at noon Pacific Time.  

Finally, look for information on this list soon for how to RSVP and attend our upcoming our upcoming Placement Resource Forums 
Limited seats in person, via phone and the web will all be options. For now, save one of these two dates:

Wednesday, February 15th, 6-9pm Pacific Time
Saturday, March 24th, 11am-2pm Pacific Time

Hang in there.

Thank you,

- Placement""

(xpost r/DoctorWho),26,4,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/BurningMan/comments/n8xz4/camp_tardis_anyone_want_to_join_xpost_rdoctorwho/,"Xpost from [**r/DoctorWho**](http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/n7wcd/camp_tardis_at_burning_man/)

Anyone here involved in a Doctor Who-themed Burning Man camp? Or possibly want to help start one?

I went for the first time last summer, and saw [**this**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihbKDErkGFs) amazing Dalek art car, and the [**TARDIS**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZYDom749hE). I don't know who made them, but there must be Whovian Burners, and a Camp TARDIS would be *so goddamn awesome.*

What I can contribute: Last summer I built a [**hexayurt**](http://vinay.howtolivewiki.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/24-2.jpg), and it was amazing. Next summer I will built another, and decorate the inside to look like a TARDIS console room. Ahistorical curiosities and pretty fabric and cushions for seating, with a [**swamp cooler**](http://eplaya.burningman.com/viewtopic.php?t=33842&amp;highlight=cooling+van) to keep it cool.

Set up a bed sheet screen and a projector, and post a schedule of old and new episode screenings. People wandering by can come in to watch an episode or just hang out.

Anyone know of any existing camps who may be interested in joining? I'm setting this thing up even if it's just me alone, but it's way more fun with other people. 

I ran the kitchen at my last camp, and if people pitch in and bring the essentials I can set up a camp stove and kitchen station and we can share some hot meals. And if we can get a good group of people together, we can split the cost and get barrels of water from Gerlach, like my last camp did.

==========================

Dear Theme Camps,

The Burning Man organization has been listening to your concerns and feedback and has come up with a plan to address our current ticket problem that rewards our community in the best way we can. Our blog, http://blog.burningman.com/, will get you up to speed on the latest thus far. There will be a new post going up as you receive this announcement. It says that we will not hold an open sale on the remaining tickets to our event as previously planned. We are turning those tickets over to our committed community instead. That means many of you. Our core volunteer staff have already been notified that they will be eligible to purchase a ticket, and next we are coming to you. Your contribution to the fabric of our event is imperative. The outcome of our ticket process this year was completely unexpected and placed camps have taken the hardest hits. We need to make sure Burning Man stays whole and that means most of the remaining $390 ticket are going to be made available to you.

There are not enough tickets left to distribute to all of the theme camps that would like to come. We have already gone through the painful process of selecting those camps that will be awarded the opportunity to purchase more tickets. In the past we have only had to not place a camp that did not follow our process or was not interactive. Now we have had to figure out a process and make some very hard choices. This has been done using the following criteria:


1. _History_ - Your camp has to be in our database in past years.(We have ways to catch name changes for groups.) We looked for past participation.

2. _Demonstrated Community Benefit_- Your camp has been interactive in a way that has been experienced as meaningful. Your camp provides support for our Burning Man infrastructure. Your camp provides services for our community. Basically, your camp helps make the community and the magic.

3. _LNT_- Your camp has demonstrated adherence to and good practices around Leave No Trace and are committed to our community perpetuating the message of pack it in-pack it out/ Don't Let It Hit the Ground and sustainability.

4. _10 Principles_ - Your camp fully embraces the 10 principles in their entirety at their core.


This must seem familiar. It is very close to our standard criteria used for placement since 1999, with the addition of consideration of the 10 principles.

Unfortunately we will not be able to reserve all the tickets needed for any one camp. There simply are not enough tickets. We have considered closely all of the variables associated with the production of your camps and weighed how difficult it is to set up, run, and take down leaving no trace. An allotment of ticket purchase opportunities has been made to accommodate the core members of your operations. Beyond this our hope is that tickets will loosen up with those that may have more than they need and the STEP program will provide the extra ticket that your theme camp would enjoy. You may also need to find other solutions such as taking in new people or changing the scope of your project. Changes like this are being made on every level and every area of Burning Man.

In order to discover if your camp has been selected for these tickets, you will need to register for placement using the standard process of filling out the questionnaire, although much sooner. Allocations have already been made there is no need to use the questionnaire to better your chances. Though we hate to say this, this may not be the year to grow your ideas and increase your size. It is the year to gather your resources, hone your message, and open your thoughts to how you can embrace a new era in our evolution.

If you are not planning on attending this year you may be allowing us to redistribute your ticket access to another camp. Proactive communication to us would be appreciated.

We are aware that some of you may be considering applying for low income tickets. That list will be cross-referenced with theme camps tickets so a requester can receive only one ticket. We would like to offer you ticket access through placement and take some of the pressure off of the low income process. Please fill out your questionnaire quickly – by March 8th – so we can let you know if you have been selected.

This year, more than ever, it is imperative that the person who fills out the questionnaire (our contact person) is in a leadership position for your camp.That is who we will be discussing ticket access with.

It is easy to want to find blame in the board, the lottery, the scalpers, but the truth is this issue is one of supply and demand.Our cumulative successes have created an event that has caught the attention of thousands that want to join us. This shift will be hard this first year, but if we plan well, we can turn this into our greatest success ever.",,False,,t5_2qj68,False,,,True,t3_ps45r,http://www.reddit.com/r/BurningMan/comments/ps45r/placement_team_letter_to_tcos/,

First of all, let me say, of our camp of 24, we have 14 tickets right now. So just over half. Between the supplemental ticket resale stuff, and the 10K ticket release later in March, and some last minute craigslist nonsense we'll get everybody in there. I hope. Last year we, we were all craigslist-ing for a month before because one of our camp-mates lost two tickets in the middle of a move. Shit happens.

Now... see if you can follow me here.

The attendance at BM has been growing every year. Last year was the first year it sold out, and we reached capacity. 

What did you EXPECT would happen this year? I thought it would be pretty self evident that tickets would be a problem this year for the first time ever. And I understand that there's burners who've been going for 10-15 years who are facing an unprecedented challenge, and are obviously freaking out. But no need to turn on the event itself! Let's be clear. Nobody fucked up here. Nobody is purposely trying to discourage established camps. I personally thought the lottery was a good system. The reason we're all pissed off is because we either didn't get tickets, or have camp-mates or close friends who didn't get tickets. So let's stop the finger pointing. 

You can't fight the numbers. I know burning man is an anti-consumerism anti-capitalism no-money type thing, but can't we all just agree that there is simply more demand than supply right now? 

More people want tickets than can possibly go.

It doesn't matter HOW you ran the ticket sales. If you did it the ""normal"" way, we'd still have sold out, and we'd still have had 40% of the veteran burners without tickets?

I mean, aside from assigning ticketing priority to veteran burners, i can't think of a way to get everybody who wants to go a ticket. It just can't be done.",,False,,t5_2qj68,False,,,True,t3_p9riy,http://www.reddit.com/r/BurningMan/comments/p9riy/how_about_we_stop_the_blame_game_and_the_they/,

2012 will be the shuttle’s 6th year on the Playa. The build story: http://www.trexxis.com

**Where can I find the shuttle at Burning Man?**
In 2012, we’ll be with ‘PlayaWaste Raiders’. If you see us, you can flag us down (Thank You naked-woman-in-a-towel-who-was-taking-a-shower-in-her-RV-when-she-heard-the-Star Trek music-and-came-running-after-us-dressed only in a towel. When we dropped her off, she gave me a perfect Star Trek Next Generation uniform. Thanks again!)

**I bet you’re one of those people who HATE Star Wars.**
For Burning Man 2002 “The Floating World”, using a Harley-Davidson golf cart chassis, I built ‘Luke’s LandSpeeder’. This same LandSpeeder was recently seen at Burning Man 2011. If you're the current owner of the LandSpeeder, let's interface. I have spare parts from Tatooine I'd like to give you. =)

**Can I rent the shuttlecraft for a Bar Mitzvah? My Wedding? My kid’s birthday party? My Star-Trek-themed Halloween Party? My sci-fi convention?**
The shuttlecraft is not street-legal. It’s sorta big. It has to be towed or put on the flatbed of a semi truck. FWIW, To merely take the shuttle to Burning Man and back, it typically costs $1,700 (truck rental, gas, diesel, anti-matter, etc.).

**You have way, way too much time on your hands.**
&lt;shrug&gt; Maybe. This is my art; this is what I can do. The shuttle brings happiness to thousands of creatures. It’s very gratifying. You don't have to be a geek, nerd, dweeb or spaz to appreciate the shuttlecraft.


*The 6 year mission of the shuttle and crew is to go to new worlds, seek out new life, drink their Tequila and boldy go where no one has gone before!*

There is a central fire tree surrounded by elevated metal flowers, many of which are wired with LEDs. The Garden has sensors that allow the plants to react to the actions of visitors: sit on a bench, make a noise, move around---the Garden will respond.

We call it a community garden because it is being planted and nurtured by members of the greater Burner community who often had no prior experience making art; we encourage participation by anyone interested in the project, we teach them how to use the tools, and we set them loose on the piece.

1364332459.0,23,self.BurningMan,1b2eo4,[BEquinox] I got my virgin toes wet at my local regional event this past weekend - it was definitely an eye-opener [wall of text],25,2,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/BurningMan/comments/1b2eo4/bequinox_i_got_my_virgin_toes_wet_at_my_local/,"I only found out about BEquinox on Wednesday, so I rushed to get a ticket, a ride, pull my camping gear together and got out to Los Angeles' first official regional event just north of Joshua Tree National Park.

I have been wanting and trying to go to BM for a few years now, so i've definitely done my research, but actually being in a micro-burn environment helped me break a lot of preconceived notions i had that may have been detrimental to my first trip. 

First off, I am not the most outgoing person and last year I stopped drinking, smoking, and using chemicals to buffer that part of my personality and i want to enjoy BM from a (mostly) sober standpoint. Seeing as this event was full of people who already knew each other or were veteran burners, I made the mistake early on of just wandering and expecting people to pull me in, rather than taking the first step myself. I didn't understand the fully participatory nature of a lot of the attractions and i ended up being a bit of a spectator. For example, I didnt realize that the Hug-Deli was designed for anyone to just go up and get behind the counter - i thought that it was something where the people who set it up worked it. 

There was a large sound camp with an impressive visual display, but (as my name implies) i come from a ravey scene and spinning glowsticks (even fuzzy LED sticks) didn't win me any favor/friends/compliments/sideways glances/etc there. The funny thing is that at one point I was wandering around alone while spinning and a ranger and his wife gave me shit saying something like 'ya know thie isnt a rave?' but he was just pulling my leg. As he walked off I confronted him with a question about the general burner distaste for ravers, but the outright acceptance of poi/fire spinning, etc. He smiled and pulled a set of trick concepts LED poi out of his vest! We got to talking for a good while and he introduced me to the creator of a really well known art car in the process.  

I still spent a lot of time wandering, but that really helped ease my mind. During the next day (prior to the burn) I met other really nice people and had some great conversations with them, one even left me in tears (of catharsis). I had brought my fire poi set and decided I wanted to spin, but there were restrictions on when and where, so I found the person to talk to who organized all the fire stuff and got all the waivers signed. I thought it was just going to be a free spin thing after the burn... but i actually signed up for the Fire Conclave!! There were around 25 performers and we had 20 minutes to fill, so i got a GREAT 5 minute session in that left me utterly glowing...

Now, i want to provide a touch of context here... the last time i spun fire, it was a at a desert rave last july. The day after that spin, at which i was at the peak of my ability and very proud of myself, I began having A LOT of grand-mal seizures and found out i have a brain tumor/low grade brain cancer. I just finished radiation therapy one week before BEquinox and i wont have a follow up appointment to find out where I stand until this coming Friday. During the intervening 8 months, I've been going though a lot of personal changes, and I like to think they're mostly for the better. 

After we all finished, I watched Seraphim burn with everyone else and it was the most spectacular and magical thing i've ever witnessed. I met a veteran burner from SF who's part of center camp and he really provided some insight into the whole weekend for me. I may even help him on one of his projects this year. 

I know the nightlife after the burn is where the celebration is at, but i still couldnt muster much of a party-mood. I decided to go to sleep early feeling a bit low after experiencing such an amazing evening. The next day I volunteered to MOOP duty and helped loading a truck after the event and I found that part to be very rewarding as it got me back into doing the event production/stage tech/crew type stuff i had been doing a few years back. 

Oh and the event's theme was Human Spirit.

**What is it?**

* C-100 Human Recharge Blend. A hand-made blend of caffeine and B-complex (B1/2/6/12/Niacin). This does an amazing job of recharging your metabolic and CNS batteries. The blend proportions are the result of a year of testing, and result in a balanced energy boost. Just make sure to have some fuel to burn in your stomach!
* L-Theanine. The primary amino acid in Green Tea, studies have shown that not only does it help cause a sense of well being and decreased stress, but it also works in tandem with caffeine to increase short term memory. Neat!
* 5-HTP. Less stress, and faster recovery.
* **Bonus!** Studies have shown that the combination of caffeine with a pain killer (like Aleve or Tylenol (Tylenol + Caffeine = Excedrin) greatly increase the effectiveness of the pain killer. If you have a monster headache, take an Aleve with the packet, and it will disappear.

When taken in tandem, the combination results in increased energy and awareness, decreased stress, and faster recovery from whatever you took the night before. Take with food and lots of water!

**What the hell are you doing?**
Creating is one of my passions. I build new things all the time - from software to electronics to carpentry to metal work.

Last year at BM, I completely forgot to bring any form of caffeine (after years of having coffee in the morning). I wasn't miserable, but it sure took a lot more work to get me to wake up in the mornings! With coffee a pain to make, and energy drinks way too expensive, heavy, and bad tasting, I decided to come up with something new. After returning home, I promised myself I would develop a solution to my caffeine needs. Months of research, and testing blends resulted in a combination that we both find extremely beneficial. It started with research into what's actually in green tea and coffee, and ended with a blend that is more effective than any of the components on its own. And at about 1/50 of the cost!

**Where to get some**
I'll be with my camp, the Playa Bike Transport, at the 9:00 plaza. You can ask for Sandman when you get there, or just look for the really, really tall guy. If I'm not in, come another time!

**Disclaimer**
With the drug culture at burning man, I know it can be a little sketchy accepting anything consumable from a ""stranger"" - but I am going to operate on the assumption that its a little more likely at BM than in the default world.

Packets will be clearly labeled with what they contain, as well as all of the ingredients. I take this combination almost daily (in place of my morning coffee). This doesn't mean its safe for you, though.

This is the first year that i have been able to even consider going to Burning Man and I was fortunate in getting a pair of tickets for myself and a friend. I dont personally know any burners, but the ethos of the event resonates with our own views in many respects. 

I realize the influx of virgins this year is scary to a lot of people (though i feel the percentages of old to new claimed by some to be quite overblown), and those concerns are quite valid. With that in mind, I dont want to 'take this year easy' and just focus on surviving in the desert, as some veterans have been suggesting. I want to hit the playa running and make the most out of my chance to participate in this increasingly exclusive event. 

I would like to know who else is in my situation: starting from scratch. If there are at least a few who are willing, I propose starting a small camp of (mostly) virgin burners. We dont have to be exclusively redditors, and I would actually prefer not to be. This would be open to anyone who's gonna be there but not as part of a larger group.

If there's some interest, i would suggest we talk a little about ourselves and what we would like to contribute to a camp in terms of art, amenities, and attitude. 

As far as a theme goes, I had my sights set on something cthulhu-ish (is there already a CAMPthulhu?)... [but that's because I built this large rear-projection Cthulhu Head](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssUlgmZBYw) for a party that never happened last fall and i would like to convert it into an interactive feature of some sort. I would be down to host a small stage for live music or a dj if we could procure a small sound system (i may have access to one). Or we could take a completely different approach to what would happen at our camp and create some kind of oasis or something. I'm quite open to ideas. 

So, I am willing to put my time, effort, and (some) money into making something that veteran burners would be blown away to know was accomplished by virgins!

1328658089.0,22,self.BurningMan,pfemr,In 1995 BRC LLC Planned for Regionals to Overtake the Big Burn According to Dr Mercury,28,6,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/BurningMan/comments/pfemr/in_1995_brc_llc_planned_for_regionals_to_overtake/,"*Originally posted on the Burner Nerds mailing list.*

To burning-nerds:

Hmm. Well, I think I can weigh in on this one. In addition to being a
doctor, a thirteen-year-burner, and a burning nerd, I'm also the
regional representative for Burning Man for the state of Connecticut,
so I've had the opportunity to eavesdrop on a number of discussions
over the years about the state of the project, including last year's
ticket sellout fiasco. So I would say: yes and no.

The notion that the Burning Man organization wants to defocus attention on the main event and promote the regionals is not a ""conspiracy theory"", it is more like the Burning Man mission statement. This decision was made not this year, but back in 1995. Burning Man was founded very much on the principals of Hakim Bey's ""Temporary Autonomous Zone"", to the point that for the first few years the Burning Man LLC was formed and dissolved every year in the same way that the city was. This stopped when the event grew to such a size that vendors were no longer willing to trade large sums of money with a one-week-old corporation, and by 1995 it became clear that Burning Man was becoming a Permanent Autonomous Zone, which is a contradiction in terms, and everyone knew it.

Two schools of thought emerged. One, headed by John Law, held that the solution lay to abandon radical inclusion, limit the size of the
event, and keep it ""under the radar""--drive drunk at high speed in the
desert shooting things and blowing shit up, yee haw! The other school
of thought, headed by Larry Harvey (and his acolytes Danger Ranger and Andie Grace), held that as soon as Burning Man incorporated
permanently, it had basically jumped the shark, and the future lay in
fostering regional events and promoting spread of the philosophy (once they figured out what it was; I don't think the 10 principles appeared until 2001 or so). I don't need to tell you which faction won. John Law was forced out, and Danger Ranger embarked on his ""Silver Seed"" tour, driving the first art car ever brought to Burning Man (which he built) across 21 states to launch local community burns, very successfully I might add.

Fifteen years later, everything predicted back then has come to pass.
You have only to check the Burning Man regional page to see how many regionals there are; I personally have lost count. Last February some guy was inaugurated as the New Zealand Regional Representative, and this marked a milestone--the first time anyone had been anointed a regional who HAD NOT ACTUALLY BEEN TO THE BIG BURN--that's how unimportant it is to the the BMORG. If you throw a regional burn, and you have a regional representative involved who can verify that the ten principles are followed, then you are covered under Burning Man insurance. Did you know that? Oh yes. A huge risk for the organization, but a marvelous lubricator of the bureaucratic wheels for regional burns, and the result is an explosion of regionals, which is exactly what they wanted. The Black Rock Arts Foundations doesn't even fund art on the playa any more. That's how far the focus has shifted.

Meanwhile, Burning Man lumbers on, like a sick dinosaur snapped at by a crowd of sharp-toothed ferrets. Undecorated law enforcement vehicles prowl the playa, arresting people (or charging $300 on the spot) at whim. Art cars are forced to carry fire extinguishers. Theme camps are forced to card minors. Nobody is allowed to serve food to the public any more, not without a Nevada State inspection license. A crowd of biting gnats has descended on the festival--inevitable, anytime the Temporary Autonomous ceases to become Temporary--and the result was predicted by the Burning Man leadership fifteen years ago. And as someone who prowled the Esplanade back in '99, I can assure you the difference is palpable. Is the Burning Man organization de-emphasizing the big burn in favor of the regionals? The answer is a resounding YES!

The other assertion, though, that they are deliberately sabotaging it, is not correct. The BLM did an environmental impact analysis of allowing Burning Man to continue versus forbidding it (this analysis is available on the internet, and to my eyes, this analysis was obviously written by a burner, since the consequences of canceling Burning Man are painted in completely apocalyptic terms), and the final decision (good for five years) was that Burning Man would be allowed to grow at a rate of 3% per year. This has never been a problem, particularly with the crash of 2008 which robbed people of disposable income (and Burning Man is pretty disposable for most people). Not until last year, which completely caught the entire organization with its pants down. Most organizations do not care about scalping, because it's money in their pocket either way, but for Burning Man scalping is not commerce, it's commodification, and that sort of thing stirs the mighty beast. Many frantic discussions were held between September and now, with many different proposals floated. You want to hear one? Everyone has to submit a photograph with their ticket request. The photograph is printed on the ticket. Scalping problem solved. Well, yes, maybe, but the proposal was rejected as offensive to everyone who might conceivably want to go to Burning Man. The current system is the best one devised by a bunch of burners sitting around using consensus-based decision-making. There are flaws, yes. But they are open to suggestions to improve the process, also yes.

So you are right, but also wrong. The BMORG believes that Burning Man is a lumbering beast that will inevitably be brought down by the forces of everything that has brought down such things in the past. But they are not deliberately sabotaging it--they don't have to. They are propping it up as long as they can. If you survey human history, you will see that the scorecard reads: Capitalism: infinity; Everyone else: Zero; and there's no reason to think that Burning Man will be any different. Hari Seldon did not engineer the destruction of the
Empire, he merely predicted it and coped with it, and the same is true of the Burning Man inner circle. Bottom line: if you have a better suggestion for dealing with ticket sales, let them know. They will take it.",,False,,t5_2qj68,True,,,True,t3_pfemr,http://www.reddit.com/r/BurningMan/comments/pfemr/in_1995_brc_llc_planned_for_regionals_to_overtake/,

People who end up with more tickets than then need have the option before the tickets are ever mailed, to sell them back to Burning Man. They get a refund.

Burning Man will take those tickets sold back and redistribute them to people who opt in to the STEP program. You must opt in, it is not automatic

This way tickets people don't want/need stay out of scalpers hands and people looking for tickets need not meet some stranger in a parking with hundreds of dollars in cash. The STEP program will operate up until physical tickets are mailed out this summer.

 - A case or so of iced Champagne/cheapass sparkling wine, much of it for gifting to the folks at Ashram Galactica

 - Sake (mostly Sho Chiku Bai and related)

 - as many different bottles of bad idea(tm) booze as we can find for under $5/ea at the local discount grocer; tequila, schnapps, rum, vodka, irish, coffee liquer, etc, for passing around with whoever wanders into camp.

 - Any leftover wine that doesn't wind up in the sangria

He's also expressed interest in the past of attending and experiencing Burning Man. His condition will unlikely change, but I had an idea and wondered if there were obvious reasons I haven't seen it out there.

I'm interested in building a life-sized manikin (or creature) with a facial display he can connect to via his webcam. People would then be able to walk up and converse with him at will, and he could feasibly ""hang out"" on the Esplanade and carry conversations with whomever walks by. I'm camped directly under a [wifi tower](https://muehlen.com/ibm/tower2010.jpg) during the event, so I'm certain I have a good location with decent access to attempt this.

I also thought of opening the station up to everyone, since I know others who are physically disabled, and unable to attend, but have in the past. I'm certain there are many more at large who know of someone or are themselves physically incapable of going for health related reasons.

Obviously, this could scale upwards with more technology (i.e. a robot that could roam the open playa or simply wave its arms would be cool), but I wondered if anyone has seen anything like it, would use it, or considers it worth me doing it.

Edit: I realize for this to work the user has to be receiving a video feed of the immediate area, and this potentially endangers the privacy of those in viewing range. I could compensate by building walls around it and putting up signs, or in the wide open and signs in the viewable area (e.g. deep playa).

1370741907.0,21,self.BurningMan,1fyi9a,My 5 minute guide to rebar for beginners,21,0,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/BurningMan/comments/1fyi9a/my_5_minute_guide_to_rebar_for_beginners/,"As soon as you start looking at things larger than 2 or 3 person tents (For which I like [this style](http://www.amazon.com/10pc-Glow---Dark-Tent-Stakes/dp/B0051XIBTI/) of stake (Haven't used this particular brand, but who can resist glow in the dark?)), long, heavy duty stakes made out of rebar are your friend for securing structures so they won't blow away.

Hardware stores sell it in a variety of lengths and thicknesses; I like 3/8 inch diameter, or possibly 1/2 inch for larger structures. 1/4 inch is, IMO, too skinny.

If you have the proper tools, you can save some money by buying longer lengths and cutting them down to size. My angle grinder cost $10 at Harbor Freight; it's a piece of junk, but it gets the job done. For the couple times a year I use one, I couldn't justify investing in a better brand. If you cut your own, don't forget to grind off any burrs and sharp edges (I use a dremel with a grinding stone). How long a stake should be depends on how big and heavy a thing you're anchoring; long enough to drive a good two feet of metal into the playa seems pretty typical. 

While things like Monkey Huts use straight lengths to secure struts, anything you're using as a tie down should be bent into a hook. Not only does this help prevent nasty skewering injuries, it makes it harder for ropes to slip off the end. Bending rebar is easy. You need two lengths of steel pipe big enough for the rebar to fit inside. Stick them over the rebar, with the junction between pipes where you want the bend to be. Stand on the long end, and pull on the short end to make a U. The pipes give you enough leverage that it doesn't take a lot of muscle. You might be able to get away with one piece of pipe; I feel that two give me better control.

When the rebar's in the playa, mark it with something bright so people have a chance of seeing it and not tripping over and hurting themselves. Flagging ribbon, stuffed animals, solar lights...   also mark your ropes for the same reason.  Stamp out rebar-inflicted injuries and make ESD, Rampart, and your fellow burners happy!

Monday after the Temple burn, when it's time to pack up, comes the fun part! Pulling up your stakes! Vise grips and lots of elbow grease are what I've used in the past. I'm tempted to make a tripod and attach a comealong to it to use some mechanical advantage to yank them out next time I'm putting up a big shade structure. Don't leave craters behind.

Once you're back in the default world, don't be like me and leave your rebar stakes outside so they get all rusted and nasty over the winter.

All of this we gifted out to the denizens of the playa. And we also stuffed our face with it. So everyone won. 

But this year, we will be back with a few new twists: We are going to operate an evening shift that will produce delicious, rich ice creams and sumptuous deserts hatch from the mind of demented genius Che Dave! I will be carting in another giant dewar of liquid nitrogen just for the fast formation of flavorful frosty phenomena. 

I am the camp bossman, Dr.Clive, taking over for Isaac who is going to be running a bar next door. If you camped with the bakery or worked with us last year, I want you back sooo badly! all of you all were wonderful! if you are new to the bakery, I would love to have you as well!

I have to admit, I much prefer this year's to last (which I was unsuccessful), but I also feel bad in part because several Burners I know haven't gotten tickets (yet).
  This all bring me to this point; I love Burning Man (one word?). Where else can you take a vacation away from your vacation by riding your bike off into the playa for a day or two, and return to your camp that you nearly forgot because that Russian chick kept offering you shots of absynth inside the belly of a GIGANTIC wooden trojan horse (literally). 
    I've gone two years prior ( '10 &amp; '11), and from the get-go I knew I was cut out for the part. I'd known about BM since the early '90s when my crazy neighbor &amp; his wife would leave then return all dusty and excited. Talking something about ""a camp in the desert with fire and booze, and booze.""  Rad. 
    This year will be even more exciting too. This year we are taking a virgin who is also a long, long time friend of mine. Before it's just been myself and my buddy. We planned well (maybe too well) but didn't have a theme camp and our tent was a huge tarp designed like a lean-to. Kinda redneck, kinda art installation. But great shade! 
    I can't wait to see all the beautiful smiling faces out and about. The 5am sound of bass-thumping art-cars pulling into their ""driveways"" like kids who just got their licenses. The Dust. The Sunsets. The bitchy women who get made fun of. The Shots. The Canadians. The Aussies. The Swedes. The mid-day tiredness that quickly fades when you remember that one camp down the road has ""Friends of Fractals"" in 30 minutes and you STILL have 3/4 a bag of shrooms. 
     The new friendships. The gifts. The mirages. The Man. The quiet, solemn air of the Temple. The lights. The Moon. The Art. The lack of water. The photos of the dead. The newly departed. That one woman, sitting, something heavy on her mind that reminds you that this isn't ALL about partying. 
   I look forward to this year with all my heart. I hope you Burners out there reading this are going home this year too. Again and again. Forever and ever. 
   For in Dust we Trust.

It was very serious. I was one of the first on scene, before rangers or medical. There was a group of us and we are all worried about his health. Some of my people will not want to know the final outcome, hell, I'm not certain I do either. For the sake of anonymity I will use initials. His name was T.F., daughter S.F. He said he was from the Seattle area. I would like to know if either of these people want to make contact with us and if they do not I would like to be able to relay that to my friends. 

So please Reddit, if you can help me with a ""this person wants to talk to you"" or a ""this person wishes no communication"" I really need to know. The event keeps replaying in my eyes and it frightens me.

PM me if you can help.

Don't mean to be a downer after such an amazing week but... you know.

my dusty love to all of you.

Wanted to let you know that the playa surface is nice and hard, though the crust is a bit weak (I figure that it will crumble a bit once serious traffic starts). Still, dust levels this year should be much lower than usual. The days have been particularly hot and slightly muggy with very little wind, but the nights have been incredible.

Denizens of Black Rock City: I am nikOpeachZ, a 7 year vet of DPW, a Playa Restoration Lead, and humble servant to the greater kool-aid swilling cult of BRC. A friend about to coordinate part of a 10 and Esplanade camp asked me to help her with their Leave No Trace plan. After some thought, deliberation, and blatant theft from other online LNT and proposals, I came up with this.

Before departing for Black Rock City:

Designate a LNT director to mobilize and organize volunteers for impromptu Moop sweeps during and after the event.
Retain at least 8 cubic feet (2’x2’x2’) of empty space in each vehicle for trash bags on your return.
Plan to haul out more than you brought into BRC. Spend the extra money for smaller sized contractor bags. The durability will save you broken bags of stinky mess, the smaller size will allow you to pack these efficiently.
Invest in a Moop-stick. You want one w/ a suction cup end. The money spent is worth not bending over for every piece of micro-trash. (£7 or $10 online)
Duct Tape the edges before leaving for the playa.
Do NOT bring sequins, glow necklaces, feathers, cheap belly-dancer bangles, flimsy paper. (Flyers left in Centr Camp end up in a burn barrel or on the trash fence.)
Remove excess packaging from everything possible.
Plan for and utilize advanced grey water evaporation ponds.
For each camp, bring at least one landscape rake, magnet rake, flat shovel, spade shovel, push broom, and numerous pairs of vise grips.
Bring mesh bags to dry out moist garbage, and 5 gallon buckets with lids for wet trash/compost (coffee grounds).
Plan easy to prepare/no clean up meals for less work, less clean up, less grey water.
Do NOT bring disposable plates/cups/silverware. Do NOT give out cups at your bar. Bring yer Blissware! (if someone doesn’t have a cup, cut the top off a bottle or can &lt;fold the sharp edge down&gt; fill with beverage, drink up, be merry.)
Educate ALL members of camp about the LNT ethic.
Upon Arrival in BRC:

Clean Up begins when you arrive in BRC. Don’t let it hit the Ground.
Utilize drop cloths/ground cover when unloading large vehicles/trucks. (8x10 tarp staked flat. Small stakes will suffice.) It only takes 5 minutes to tack down, and will save you 30 minutes of crawling through dust later. This catches miscellaneous debris that always disperses and sheds while unloading.
Secure everything against the wind. Shade structures, tents, totes just removed from your rig, even your hat will want to blow away.
Cover the playa with ground cover wherever people gather. Under shade, inside carports, in the ‘living room’ area between tents. Use light duty tarps, recycled billboards, canvas, carpet (heavy and nasty when filled with playa), or weed barrier are options. If you can sweep it, you can keep it clean and keep moop off the playa.
Place drop cloth/staked cardboard under fluid leaking vehicles and generators.
Place drop cloth under firewood piles (before unloading) Wood chips are some of the most frustrating and time consuming of Moop Hot-Spots.
Transform empty 1 and 2 gallong water jugs into Moop buckets by cutting a 5” hole in the top, secure it by tying it onto your person or structure, carabiner this to yourself and carry it on excursions into the city. Sharpie MOOP on it in clear bold lettering. In every posse, carry at least one Moop bucket for trash and treasures discovered during your foray into BRC. Be proud that you are utilitarian as well as fashionable in your accessory choice.
Throughout the Event

Pick up moop immediately when you see it. You will have less energy and it will be less fun on Sunday/Monday.
Separate recycleables, burnables, and trash. Burn paper trash as often as possible in a burn barrel/platform. If you wait till Sunday then you will have a hot barrel to deal with on Monday.
Perform daily moop patrols and Line Sweeps in heavily trafficked areas within your camp and in all surrounding areas.
Smash every can/plastic bottle/trash as compact as possible before depositing in recycling… You will be grateful for the smaller trash bags.
Carry your own Blissware everywhere (reusable personal beverage cup, bowl/plate, and fork). After use, rinse and scrub with water, drink water with food debris, rinse again, drink, and Voila! Dishes Done!
Educate, Educate, Shame, and Cajole any messy members of your camp (and the city) to keep their shit/moop tight. They make the mess that you will clean up later.
Bring regular deposits of smashed aluminum cans to Recycle Camp in the Center Camp circle.
Upon departure from Black Rock City:

Line Sweeps, Line Sweeps, and more Line Sweeps. Best done after structures and tents are removed and your packed vehicles are staged in the road. Line Sweeps are key to Leaving No Trace.
Pack each vehicle as efficiently as possible and make sure to send early departing vehicles with as many trash bags as possible. Don’t leave your friends on playa with spare space in your car because they will end up with piles of garbage bags that cannot be safely packed into their rig. Secure your load to withstand 70+ mph winds if outside the vehicle.
Ensure that enough people stay behind to handle the footprint of your camp. The best laid plans of LNT camps mean little when too few people are left behind to erase your trace.
To save space and weight for a long drive back to civilization, prepare a care package of beer, liquor, cigarettes, porn, non-perishable food, unopened mixers, full propane bottles, condoms, toiletries, lotion, sun-block, batteries, and things you don’t want the bad men with uniforms, badges, and guns to take you to jail for. Load this box LAST and drop off with the kinder, gentler, better looking, and better smelling DPW at the Collexodus station immediately before gate road (6 and past L). DON’T be fooled by imitations! Accept only these surly black shirted hooligans as worthy recipients of your gift. The DPW have spent one month on Playa by the time you leave, and the DPW will remain for another month to disappear the infrastructure of BRC and perform line sweeps over the entire city. The citizens of BRC keep the DPW fed and clothed and drunk. They Love You and also love our shared creation of BRC. Fuck your day.
Strike big structures and trash piles as quickly as possible. When the city begins to disappear, winds will create dunes around anything still standing and bury moop. Landscape rakes and push brooms can be used to spread and disperse these dunes to uncover moop within.
Break up hardened grey water stains with landscape rake to free and erase micro-moop.
Rebar can be extracted with vise grips by twisting and spinning until it pulls out.
Broken off t-stakes can be dug out around the top, then clamp a vise grip as a lever point for the shovel. If you can’t manage that, mark it with a traffic cone or tie a ribbon to it. If the DPW can find it, they can remove it and keep it out of someones tire next summer.
After an area is cleared of ALL vehicles and tents, perform multiple line sweeps over said area to discover moop, treasure, money, and mystery pills overlooked. (Line Sweeps are so important, they are worth mentioning thrice).
Bring usable lumber (stripped of hardware) and plywood to gift Burningman to build next years event at donation stations located near burn platforms along the Esplanade.
If you don’t have to leave on Sunday or Monday, don’t. 8 hrs of waiting in Exodus traffic is nobody’s idea of a good time. Better to maintain a single shade structure and completely erase all signs of your surrounding area and camp. Take your time and be satisfied that you have Left No Trace. Then, take out your driver’s license, read the address, go there.

1308149012.0,21,self.BurningMan,i0bxv,Ez's Burning Man Supply List 2011,24,3,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/BurningMan/comments/i0bxv/ezs_burning_man_supply_list_2011/,"I was chatting with a local burner and mentioned it would be my first trip out to Black Rock, he wanted to share with me his comprehensive list of supplies to bring, I want to share it with you guys! EZ is a member of the disorient camp so there is some camp specific stuff in here YMMV. 

Welcome to EZ's Burning Man supplies 2011 edition.

Getting started:

Below is my base list of supplies for the burn. I tend to over pack, so don't assume you need everything listed. You could show up with a ticket and nothing else and manage to survive. If you buy a good amount of this you'll have a much happier burn. Get a head start on your supply list and you'll save yourself a lot of stress and money. Most of this stuff you'll be able to find random deals on in stores and online throughout the year. ilike to check things off and hide them away til august

The burn will come quicker than you think and no matter how prepared you are, the last week before you leave is going to be stressful. Do what you can to stay ahead of the game.

Enjoy and feel free to share this with anyone you think might benefit from reading this.

* BOARDING PASS
* AIRPLANE TICKET
* BURNING MAN TICKET
* EARLY ARRIVAL PASS (if applicable)

**Toiletries and Body Care:**

* 2 x Deodorant
* Tooth paste &amp; Brush
* Soap
* Shampoo: (Dr.Bronner's is great!)
* 4x Toilet paper rolls
* 2x Towel
* Razor &amp; shaving cream
* 1-2x Boxes of Baby wipes: (Highly recommended. It's enitrely up to you if you want scented or not)
* 2x Chapstick
* Lotion
* Vinegar: (The desert is made of alkali dust and can cause some discomfort on your feet if you don't always wear proper footwear. Don't plan on going barefoot, but I always find myself walking around from time to time with no shoes on. A 1/4 vinegar to 3/4 water mix will clear the playa dust that may be bothering your hands or feet. You don't need to bring more than a small bottle and it's a fine thing to share)
* Earplugs: (Some parties are just too loud, sometimes earplugs may be the only thing that will help you get to sleep in your own tent)
* Allergy meds
* Pedialyte: (Extremely good for hangovers and hydration, sometimes the sun and booze can get the best of you or someone you care about)
Saline nose rinse (Not needed, but a nice thing to have. A fine thing to split the cost of among friends, even though not entirely expensive)
* Vitamin C: (Great for recovery and keeping healthy. you are going to put a lot of wear and tear on to your poor body, without eating normal meals. Vitamins, especially C will help. On top of basic vitamins I would also pick up a few packets of Emergen-C)
* Hand sanitizer: (At least a bottle or two, one for home base and a travel one is best)
* 2x Sunscreen: (Same has Hand sanitizer)
* Camel back: (I find myself rarely using mine, but tons of people swear by them. A great thing to shop around early for a good price)
* 2x Water bottles: (I prefer ones that you can put carabiners through)

**Sleeping Gear:**

* Tent
* Air Mattress &amp; pump
* Sleeping bag
* Pillows: (You can bring a carry on bag and a pillow for the plane)
* Blanket: (Nights are insanely cold. I tend to cover myself in my sleeping bag, blankets and coats)

**Dining:**

* Fork/Knife/Spoon: (Disposables are bad, try to think of as little of a footprint as possible. I suggest even two sets, you may misplace yours, or loan them out and never find them again)
* Bowl: (see Fork/knife/spook)
* Plate: (see Fork/knife/spook)
* Large Cup: (Tons of people will have free drinks to share, but will not have cups. You will regularly want travel with a cup for booze that will be kept seperate from your waterbottle)
* Coffee Mug: (This can be the same as your large cup, but if you're a coffee drinker, I'd suggest bringing one)

**Tools:**

* Leatherman: (I find at least some set of small tools to be extremely useful)
* Ziplock Bags: (great for packing and organizing while you're out there. They can be super handy for keeping electronics safe, dust out of your undies, and keeping small shit together in your tent)
* Tennis balls: (for tent spikes, not needed, but nice. beer cans and various other objects work fine)
* Duct tape: (There is always a use for duct tape and zipties, I like brightly colored ones that can be used to identify things if needed)
* Zip ties
* Vice Grip: (good for pulling up rebarb, not really needed, but if you're staying for disengege you'll want a pair)
* Work Gloves: (in a safety 3rd world, you'll want to be as prepared as possible)
* Portable Sewing Kit and Safety Pins: (because wardrobe malfunctions happen)

**Electronics:**

~Disorient has power. Cables run through out the camp, don't count on having it in your tent, but be aware that our kitchen will always have power. Including a microwave and coffee pot. NOTE: EZ is part of the disorient camp, your camp may vary, check your local listings.
* Camera
* Batteries
* Flashlights
* Head Lamp
* Lantern / some way to light your tent: (good for your tent, it gets super fucking dark)
* Wrist Watch: (You won't be walking around with your phone and most people aren't wearing them. The more you know)
* Extention cord/power strip: (if you want to try and get power to your tent)

**Misc:**

* Book: (I like the idea of bringing your favorite book to gift later You may want something for the plane, or if you just need something to escape in to while you're out there)
* Bike &amp; Lock: (there are a variety of services that sell burner bikes for cheap that you can pick up on the way from reno. There is also a massive walmart in Reno that sells cheap bikes. They are not needed, and you can always borrow others. Bikes are nice if you can strap it to your ride in and have the extra cash).
Note Book (I try to bring at least two. One normal size and one pocket. You'll find lots of things and people you'll want to remember and dont have the luxury of a phone to take notes with)
Pens &amp; Sharpie (at least a few pens)
* Small Tubs/Bins: (these are more complicated to take with if you are not shipping some of your stuff out. I find they help me avoid living entirely out of my luggage bags and helps me keep some things organized)

**Clothing:**

~It is extremely easy to overpack clothing. There are no real right or wrongs here. The burn is a chance for you express yourself in any way you wish, as long as you keep the elements in mind. Do what you can to work pockets in to clothing that doesn't have them. You'll always want to bring at least a few things with you when you leave camp and you may want a pocket for moop. Here are a few basic suggestions.
* Winter / Fur / Warm coat
* Bathing Suit: (multiple tops for ladies)
* Hoodie
* A warm comfy outfit to sleep in
* Thermals
* Return trip clothing: (I usually set an outfit aside that I have in a plastic bag, which is ideally left in your ride out of the burns car. When you leave the playa you'll want something fresh and it's always helpful to look like a normal person when dealing airplanes and layovers)

**Wearable Accessories:**

* Backpack / Travel bag: (I usually bring both)
* Utility Belt / Fanny Pack: (Ideal for the playa. The more you have to carry, the more you have to lose, but you'll always have stuff to carry).
* Flip-flops/Sandles/Slippers (I like some form of comfy foot wear. You're going to do an insane amount of walking and it's nice to have something comfy on your feet when you're back at camp that protects your skin from the playa)
* Warm hat: (wool, knit, etc)
* 3x Bandanna: (painters masks and gas mask style things work as well, but bandannas are the least bulky and easiest thing to always have on hand to protect you from dust storms)
* 2x Goggles: (I usually bring two shaded for the day &amp; two clear night, but you only really need two)
* Scarf
* 2x Sunglasses: (cheap disposable)
* Sock pack: (brand new 12 pack. You will want at least one brand new pair of socks per day)
* 2x Belts:
* Gloves: (I like a cheap fingerless pair for the evenings)
* Leg Warmers / Thigh High Socks
* Underwear

When deciding what clothes to bring it's important to be aware that the days are hot and the nights are cold. A mix of things for both is great, but realize you'll want limited clothing during the day and the night are far more fun to dress up. Check the costume outfits you are planning on bringing and look for tiny bits that might fall off and become moop. NO FEATHERS!

Come to our Fundraiser Party this Thursday, [""Spark the Flame""](https://www.facebook.com/events/111233639028322/)!

It's a fundraiser for LA DECOM happing on Oct 13th. If you haven't heard, this year it's not only going *all night* until dawn, we also have permission from the city for the first time to burn an art piece, the [Seraphim](http://laleagueofarts.org/what-we-do/community-burn/). You may have seen it on the playa this year, it was part of the CORE burn. We're building a replica for DECOM. 

Please come by and support us! We got awesome DJs and great vibes. Just 10 measly bucks for presale. All proceeds go to fund the first burn in the history of LA Decom! 

Presale link: http://sparktheflame.eventbrite.com/

PS: if you choose the ""Special Donor"" option, you get [this rad shot glass](https://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-snc7/408806_10152141116075014_1327289224_n.jpg) as a gift!

PPS: If you can't come, but still want to support this project, you can donate [here](http://laleagueofarts.org/donate/) (use the third link, ""Community Burn Projects"").

edit:  I'm crossposting something I wrote on eplaya about this:

The lottery really is making me sad.

It goes against several of the core principles.

&gt;Gifting

This system encourages hoarding, and benefits those who actively try to prevent other people from being able attend. It's disgusting.

&gt;Radical Self-reliance

The lottery is the *opposite* of self-reliance. Getting a ticket isn't a function of myself being reliant and responsible, it's a function of chance. Sure I could fuck over my neighbors by registering with *all* of my credit cards, but I could also steal water and food from my neighbors on the playa. Is that ""self reliance""? Not really.

&gt;Communal Effort

This one should be pretty obvious. The lottery does the opposite of encouraging community. It pits us against each other.

I haven't gotten my confirmation yet, which sucks, and I'm starting to think I won't be getting a ticket from the lottery. That's shitting on my day a little. I'm not *mad* at the org, and I'm sure that I'll figure out how to get my ticket either through my network, or STEP or whatever, I'm just disappointed in them for fucking up *this* hard, and not being willing to say ""hey, guys, sorry."".

I just wish they would apologize for this. Everybody fucks up. You guys fucked up this time.

*edit:* I want to add that I have discussed it with him that I still want to go by myself, but he seems worried and suggested that I find someone I know (which I don't have anyone) to guide me through.

I am excited to see those same virgins stoked on life with their arms open crying and laughing covered in dust and paint and self love the night the man burns. I am excited to get weird with some people I have never met and experience that sensation when you've never met each other, and you don't even have to speak before giving each other a big hug and laughing. I am excited to be able to wear a dress again(as a straight male). I am excited to take a nap in some random pink dome. 
I just discovered a gift I am going to start creating to give out this year at the playa. Something small and personal, created with intention and love. Just like this post!
I love you guys. Virgins congrats on this being your time to have the best experiences of your life. Everyone else, congrats on us being here and able to go do this again!

All rebar, heavy duty tarps, and cut and duct-taped pipes included and ready to erect, including the additional shade flap. The center PVC pipe got a little melted by an ill-placed lantern and will need to be replaced. Other than that, it's in perfect condition. You'll need to get your own zip ties or bungee cords and guy lines for it as well.

If all goes well we will have friken' lasers and flame throwers attached to an aircraft this year with the nose as the DJ booth!!! We think this is within the cargo cult theme and welcome zombie air hostesses or any other fantastic fun involvement. If any of you have any lightbulb ideas please let us know!!

My name is Miss Ngabolo Olashade, the director of theme-camp ticket
purchases for the Nigeria Dubstep Camp to be located at 9:20 and Castration at Black Rock City. It is my pleasure to inform you of a transaction involving some fifteen (15) over-invoiced Tier-1 ($240) Burning Man ... tickets purchased in January 2012.
These are paper tickets and unfortunately we cannot pick them up due to our foreign status. We need a Burner located in the United States to process the transaction, for which repayment will be provided. Four of the fifteen tickets will be ""gifted"" to the transaction partner following the transfer of payments. We ask that this transaction be carried out in the strictest confidentiality.
If you are interested, please send email to me and we will contact you
shortly about the arrangement of your monies and tickets.

Many blessings.

The Earth Harp? I did not see that! WTF!

And yet I saw lots of stuff that it seems no one else seems to have seen. And I did things I've never done before.

Is that just the nature of Burning Man? Everyone's experience will be different, so don't try too hard to see or do everything? Cuz I gotta say, I see that picture of the movie theater, and I get a little bummed out that I didn't see it. But I wouldn't trade my experiences for anything.

It's interesting how you begin remembering little details from the trip days after it's over and suddenly this happiness and energy just envelopes you for a brief moment. I feel comforted and secure.... and then I go back to default.

It is a significant reason behind our theme camp not returning to the playa this year.

The problem started at Burning Man 2009. Specifically Build Week of Burning Man 2009. Everyone was happy as a clam, hard at work constructing their contributions to our fair city. Except suddenly, the BMorg folks began going camp to camp, informing us that if we needed to leave the city during Build Week (which, having many more loads left, we had to do many times), we would have to pay the re-entry fee. Before the event STARTED.

Now, the re-entry fee makes sense. We don't want people coming in, snapping some photos, and then going back to Gerlach to try to find a room. Or leaving every day to go shopping. The re-entry fee helps discourage spectators. But this was now put into effect when the only people in the city were already putting significant amounts of their own time and money into making something for the event, often with further trips out of the city required to finish their projects. They needed to go get more supplies? Fuck 'em. Make them pay.

Now that was annoying, and as far as I know was reversed because everyone got up in arms about it. What has NOT been reversed, however, was the change that BMorg made shortly before Build Week 2010. This was when they kindly informed us that whereas the previous arrangement for truckers carrying theme camp equipment was to take their credit card information and not charge them if they were out of the city within three hours (a fair and useful system), now we just had to buy them a ticket. Even though they WEREN'T ATTENDING THE EVENT. The reasons given were this, quoted from their e-mail:

. To find a better balance between de-commodification and radical self-reliance.

. To encourage communal effort and hopefully lessen the overall environmental impact of our event.

. ""Refundable"" vendor tickets created a disproportionate drag on our staffing resources and were frequently abused.

. Expedited vendor access at entry reduces wait times for everyone.

No details were given about how the previous system was abused, nor any kind of logical reasoning explaining how not giving us our money back would make the process faster, ease stress on their staff, make Burning Man greener, or encourage self-reliance. This is the Burning Man Organization building on a pattern, a pattern of punishing those that are contributing most to the event simply to line their own pockets.

Now I'm doing it again.

Last year, a nicely sized group gathered, chilled out, and we had a good time! We, among other things, tried Japanese minty eyedrops (surprisingly refreshing! Thanks /u/kamakiri!), tried awesome Jalapeno/Habanero? whiskey (Thanks to /u/Retsejme, who also provided the meeting place at Costco Soulmate Trading Outlet!), and then later we braved a dust storm to get to the gate where we ended up doing an impromptu greeter shift just as the gates opened.



Both years, the meetup time has ended up being 4:pm on Sunday and they've been a good time. 

We should do it again.  Who's in?

1329660396.0,20,self.BurningMan,pwfbj,Our road ahead - bringing Burner culture to Burning Man,26,6,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/BurningMan/comments/pwfbj/our_road_ahead_bringing_burner_culture_to_burning/,"From back here in the cheap seats, it seems to me that there are a lot of fears and uncertainties bubbling to the surface of our community.  It saddens me to see us in this state, feeling victim to the circumstances that are set before us.  From the end of the ticket lottery I've been pondering how the problems of a population that is growing younger (culturally) might impact the event and our culture as a whole.

Do you remember your first year at Burning Man?  Of course you do, because when you think about what you fear will change, you can help but think about the things that had you say to yourself, ""This is amazing, I am coming back next year!” for the very first time.  The same can be said of how some of started our first journey, we read or heard stories and something in them drew us from our comfortable lives to go spend a week battling sunburn, dehydration, and heat stroke.

A photograph started my journey toward the desert that first time, one that still has great impact for me today whenever I look at it.  What photo showed was the action of many of the ten principles at work, radical inclusion, decommodification, community effort, civic responsibility, participation, immediacy, and gifting.  Physically the photo showed a moment in time where a community pulled together to help mask the logos on a rented truck. Veterans helping new people find their way in to our culture, they realized that it was everyone's job to build community values and uphold them, so everyone did.  

Here is the problem as I see it:  We want Burning Man delivered to us in the way we remember it, want it, and expect it.  We don't carry our moop bags as much, we don’t talk to our neighbors and make them a part of us as much, we don’t go all out to cover our logos and set the environment that supports and grows our values and tenants as much.  We have nested, made ourselves far too comfortable and now we've brought to Burning Man what we had at home.  We get off our couches and work really hard to build a better, novelty sized couch with a bitchin' sound system and 150 horsepower, and then sit down on it instead.

Now I am not saying that people don't work hard or that nobody does their part to make Burning Man happen or hold close our principles to their hearts.  People do, we do, but if we are not willing to up our game, to bring it CULTURALLY, then we will be left behind wondering what happened to that thing we loved.  If we do not adapt to the challenges of our time, then we give up our franchise and we silence ourselves better than any outside force, boogie monster, or invading army of virgins on their way to the ""world's biggest party"" might be able.  To invoke the stone soup metaphor, it is what we make of it, so don’t just bring your best stuff.  Bring your best YOU.

I think that there is little debate here, the change HAS occurred.  Now it is time for us, veterans and virgins alike, to really take our participation to the next level and to cause the culture we want to be a part of.  Make the people who don’t seem to get it your friends, show them what is special about this space that we make for ourselves out of nothing.  Treat these people as a part of the whole, as a part of your neighborhood, your community, your burn, and they will act a part of who we are.  Give up, let them run you off or simply give up before you really get started and they will stay how they are, insulated from us, observers, not participants.

Sometimes the hardest thing to do in life is to remember that we are capable of loving each other.  What you do when you reach out to extend the Burning Man culture to others is a gift of love from yourself to them.  Open your heart and just say it.  Welcome to our street, our neighborhood, and our culture.  To you strangers that are about to be friends, welcome home.

The dream was to go to the place called Burning Man but everyone I knew always thought it was a crazy hippie idea to go out into the desert for a week. I was convinced that THIS experience is what I NEEDED.Then finally last year I met some like minded people and we started to plan the trip. There wasn't a day that went by we didn't talk about BM. One of these people had gone twice with a few of my other new friends. Well hell it's been a rough trip and that friend of mine had more faith in the playa than anything else in the world it is his HOME. He was the one that when this ticket fiasco started still had faith and kept pushing us through. He even called up to the office and left a long ass message and got a call back. But then yesterday something changed in him.  When they decided to sell the 10,000 to the theme camps he gave up on this year. Something about how the large theme camps that put MONEY into burning man are more important than that  guy from Kentucky with a group of friends who are going off of idea's and improvisation alone. He feels it's some sort of money/popularity contest with this decision. So we had a ""family"" meeting and decided this year all the time we have spent saving and planning for Burning man is not going to be wasted. The chance of all of us going is pretty slim now. If all of us can't go then it's not worth it.

INSTEAD we're going to take a cross country trip and see if we can't find the same ideas in people living in the default world. Who knows maybe we'll see a few other of the ""burning man rejects"" out there. 


But seriously if you go this year cherish it! Don't waste the experience. You're lucky you we're able to get the chance. BUT who says we can't be just as lucky? You have to make your experience not wait for it to fall into your lap. 

I feel like I'm a virgin who's been chew up and spit out before even getting the experience. I'm not too sore over it. I'll see the playa just not during the burn.

I felt like the percentage of virgins to non-virgins was higher than it may have been in the past, and I've heard from multiple people that a huge number of people they ran into had no clue about many of the core elements of the burn (10 principles, the meaning behind the temple and the man, etc).

Quick disclaimer.  This was only my second burn and I only have my two years of personal experience and what I've gleamed from conversations with burners who have been going for considerably longer than I have.

Burning Man and burner events are made on the backs and sweat of those who participate.  Unlike other events in which an organizer makes all of the decisions as to what will be happening at the event, at the burn, it is up to each and every participant to bring burning man to life.  

What I think people fail to realize about this is the following.  

If there is something that you feel the event is lacking, it is your responsibility to bring that to the event.  

If there is something going on at the event that you wish would change, it is your responsibility to make that change happen.

For those who are frustrated with how the event was different this year, or with the influx of virgins, or with anything, you can complain about, or you can do something about it.

One of the biggest things I think we can all do is ensure that tickets end up in the correct hands to start off with.  Years past, I think many many long term burners were accustomed to purchasing their tickets closer to the date of the event or even at the gate.  I fully believe that the event is going to sell out again next year so as a community, I think that we can ensure that tickets end up in the right hands by ensuring that the sellout happens sooner than later.  Talk to everyone you know who is planning on going and make sure they buy their tickets early.  Even if they are only 30% sure they might be going, encourage them to buy a ticket anyways.  A ticket to burning man is as good as cash in your pocket.  I had close to 10 people I knew who didn't get their tickets in time, and out of those 10, only one never go this ticket.  And he didn't get one because he gave up a full three weeks before the event.  

As a community we can ensure that tickets are getting in to the right hands.  We can ensure that virgins know about the ten principles.  Burning man is our event.  It will grow, and it will change, but we can be sure that the change is something we're actively promoting.",,False,,t5_2qj68,False,,,True,t3_kba8s,http://www.reddit.com/r/BurningMan/comments/kba8s/it_is_your_responsibility_to_make_burning_man/,

""Welcome home"" those two seemingly simple words, for me, are the true heart of burning man; when you're in BRC, you are home. Its one of the best feelings in the world, having a home. I mean yah, I have an apartment, but its where I live, not my home. When you move out of your parents the thought of home goes away, it changes, and since I graduated high school and moved away almost a decade ago I had no place I thought of home, until I found the playa. Here I felt welcome, here I was home, and I just can't wait to go home again. ",,False,,t5_2qj68,False,,,True,t3_f20hz,http://www.reddit.com/r/BurningMan/comments/f20hz/i_just_want_to_go_home/,

&gt; our genesis was on the playa last year (""Evolve""), and you may remember our giant silver fish mist tent/dance floor/fishBAR at 4:45 and DNA. This year we're in a prime corner spot at 3:00 and Florence, and we're a bit bigger - we have a 24' tower for trapeze and silks, along with some sweet flame effects, lots more lights, bigger, burlier mist area, a few parties, trapeze performances and henna events (check the What Where When), and some Dihydrogen Monoxide Happy Hours in the mist to beat the heat. Evaporative cooling rules.
We'll be setting up Friday, Saturday and Sunday, so we'll be ready to go for our Welcome Home Party on Monday night at 8pm. Look for the fish, lights and the fire, you can't miss it.
