I was about to go to sleep, when I realized I had to take the trash out. As I walked out of my room, I smelled smoke, but didn't really think too much of it, as everyone in my house is a smoker. Well, after I got done with the trash, and went to walk back in my room, I could smell it even stronger. I started poking my head in all of the rooms of the house, until I got to my grandmothers' room. She had her door closed, because she was dog sitting, and the dog is a real pain in the ass. Well, I opened the door, and if her TV hadn't been on, I wouldn't have been able to see anything through the smoke...What had happened was she fell asleep smoking a cigarette, and it fell out of her hand, onto a small rug next to the bed. That rug in turn caught on fire, and started to catch her sheets on fire. The only reason any of us are alive and/or have a place to live is because I stay up playing CoD until 5 or 6 AM because of my schedule. I don't want your karma, I just thought this might be something to be shared. Call of Duty saves, bitches.

No one treats anyone with respect around here, for real. Someone can come in and say ""I really enjoy playing Black Ops 2"", and that'll somehow end up with 20+ downvotes and spark an argument between the thirteen year old kids around here, which shouldn't even be playing the game in the first place, but that's how it is now.

1353086734.0,398,self.blackops2,13b27f,BLOPS2 is not MW3 and needs to be played differently.,514,116,294,http://www.reddit.com/r/blackops2/comments/13b27f/blops2_is_not_mw3_and_needs_to_be_played/,"I am writing this short guide because after a year of slaying in MW3 I became frustrated at my inability to kick ass in BLOPS 2 (lag comp aside). I thought about what was going wrong, and here is my solution. Please add your own tactics or call me out for any mistakes in logic.

Those of you who spent any length of time playing BLOPS will probably know this, but those of you who spent any length of time playing MW3 will likely have forgotten:

**BLOPS is meant to be played slowly and carefully, but works hard to keep you from camping. **

The designers of this game did not reward constant rushing with high kill streaks. This is illustrated by the tight shapes of the maps, the amped up explosives, instant deaths from kills streaks, and a nerfed ghost perk that isn't awarded until level 55. 

One cannot mindlessly rush and expect to do well. Nor can one lay in the back of the map with a sniper rifle and expect to remain undetected. In MW3 it was easy enough to employ either of those strategies and do extremely well. This game is different. Nor is it possible to win a long range gun fight while spraying and praying - this game takes aim.

The solutions (in no particular order): 

1.Walk almost everywhere - the action on the smaller maps will come to you. 

2. Pop out and back from cover when you expect an engagement.

2. Equip the attachable stock to your weapons for faster ADS strafing (to avoid detection when using ghost). 

3. BURST FIRE - this cannot be said enough.

4. Play the objective, but do so thoughtfully - constantly rushing at B without team support will only get you killed.

5. Mantling is a big part of this game and getting shot while climbing a ledge sucks so use dexterity.

6. This game favors team play in a big way. So even if you are playing as a lone wolf do your best to stick with other players. Assists are valuable.

7. Drop shotting is incredibly effective in CQC and quickly going prone is useful also for dropping behind cover when losing a gunfight.

8. Use tactical items frequently. Concussion grenades and shock charges are awesome for slowing down the pace of play and allowing you a momentary advantage. 

9. Follow your instincts. If you have been heading in a straight line for a while and haven't encountered anyone, most likely it's because they are actually following you.

10. Relax, slow down, take some deep breaths and have fun while you watch your K/D climb.

I hope this helps for some of you.

Happy Hunting.

Edit: Here is a GREAT video from OpticScumpii (who is arguably the best pro player in the world) that outlines how to rush effectively - http://youtu.be/QV9kflGDsIs

I know this argues for rushing while I maintain that moving more slowly is best for this game. However, I still believe that the tips above are advisable for those of us aren't COD Gods like Scump.

They are NOT going to patch this. They are not going to even ACKNOWLEDGE it. So don't give me your ""I have faith in Treyarch!!"" bullshit. This will NOT be fixed unless we do what we did when they took Nuketown away.

We all paid good money for this first person SHOOTER. Isn't it time the SHOOTING aspect of this fucking game actually works? We either demand this gets fixed now or we do exactly what Treyarch wants us to do: slowly and painfully accept it and just continue playing this game anyway even though we don't enjoy it (Don't lie. Even when you hate COD, you still play it).

""why are there not any attachments for this"" So then I started to brainstorm some ideas. 

Assault Shield Unlock 1:
Stronger Glass - causes the bullets shot at the shield to make less of                 a smear on the shield. 

Assault Shield Unlock 2:
Rounded Edge - Makes the sides of the shield slightly wrap around your body so it is harder to kill you from the side. 

Assault Shield Unlock 3:
Spikes - Puts a bed of spikes on your shield,  allowing you to kill enemy's with one bash.

Assault Shield Unlock 4: 
Light Shield - Makes the Assault Shield lighter, allowing you to melee faster then normal. Also allows you to run faster. (smg speed) 

Assault Shield Unlock 5: 
Planter - Allows you to put the Assult Shield in the ground faster and anywhere (CardozoSmash)

Assault Shield Unlock 6: 
Half-Shield - Allows you to hold half the shield in one hand, and a pistol of your choice in the other. More kills. Less cover...Move at a reduced speed. (CardozoSmash)

Assault Shield Unlock 7:
Trophy shield - Uses up a secondary grenade slot and puts a trophy system on your shield that only works on two items. (Reptilian_overlords)

Assault Shield Unlock 8:
Hole - Your shield has a hole in it: when running around, it makes you more vulnerable, but when you plant the shield, you can shoot through it. (TheBlitzbolt)

Assault Shield Unlock 9:
Explosive Shield - When placed, Shield has a unit of C4 on it. Can be detonated at anytime. C4 cannot be harmed untill detonation. (nmpraveen)


That's all i got for now. Be sure to let me know what you think! If you guys have any ideas, feel free to leave a comment! :D (Attachments are not written in the same order they would be unlocked in. Just the way I added them in)

EDIT: Added more unlocks,

1365151655.0,360,self.blackops2,1bq192,"I'm ""Leaking"" Mob of the Dead... #fuckyouTreyarch",515,155,233,http://www.reddit.com/r/blackops2/comments/1bq192/im_leaking_mob_of_the_dead_fuckyoutreyarch/,"Hey, ok so I'm new to this reddit thing but I heard that its a great place to talk about things (really don't know how this is different from a forum but whatever) so here it goes: I've got a bunch of info to lay off my chest. So, I'm not going to get into too much detail here but I was affiliated with Treyarch and worked on the campaign as well as the recently announced zombie map Mob of the Dead. What 3Arc did as an internal move to get high-quality DLC out fast is actually have the campaign team design and script Mob of the Dead. 

So, basically the zombie team has already a rough draft of all the DLC maps they'll release (I don't know much about future ones though) and are currently working on DLC 3 and 4. So what happened with mob of the dead (or ""Mobzies"" as was the working title [im not fucking joking here that was actually the working title]) was that Treyarch (or more accurately Activision) was imploring for DLCs to be ready faster (I'm not to sure about the details there, I wasn't involved on the business end of things but that's what we were told). 

So, right after DLC 1 dropped the zombie team started working on DLC 3 and 4. The zombie team subsequently sent us a rough draft for what they had in mind for Mob of the Dead and asked us to develop it while they worked on the last 2 DLC drops (which by the looks of things seem very big). They really only seemed concerned on the storyline aspect of the map, other than that they were pretty lenient when it came to ideas.  the zombie team really just gave us their input on MotD, they really did not develop it and most of the contributions came from the campaign front (and frankly it's a radically different approach to zombies as I'll explain later). 

I will confess I haven't played the map yet but know about most things it will incorporate as the final product rarely diverts too far from the original concept. The map, as you know, features a cast of Hollywood ""gangsters"" playing fictitious mobsters within Alcatraz island. The overall idea was similar to have these 4 actors trapped in some kind of time loop, with amnesia of who they were as actors, fighting zombies in Alcatraz. Originally we had the roles for the actors envisioned for Al Pacino (whom we imagined wouldn't decline us as he starred in that god-awful Adam Sandler movie), Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci, and Mike Madsen, but Al and Joe were working on movies. We eventually settled on having Joe Pantoliano and Chazz Palmentiri replace those characters. But before we decided on the whole Hollywood aspect, we settled on some ideas after what seemed like endless open discussions and brainstorming. 

From what I could remember these were the ten ""things"" I know for a fact will be on the map:

- a ""purgatory mode"" (the team was really hyped about this one)

- varied kinds of zombies 

- a real cool side-quest

- dynamic environment

- zip-lines galore

- horror/thriller theme

- historically correct Alcatraz 

- not too hard for beginners

- plenty of new perks and guns

- musical aspect

The first thing I want to talk about is this purgatory mode. Basically, once your character is downed and is not revived and bleeds out he access this new area called purgatory. Purgatory is actually like its own separate map (its absolutely massive) with an entirely different objective. There are no zombies in purgatory and its like this weird inter-dimensional trance space, and it may or may not have been influenced by LSD. The idea is that there's no time or space in this place. It's like this weird Pandora's box kind of place with weird ass things everywhere. It's a huge part of the side quest. And the whilst you are walking through here you are meant to get scared. You have weird voices telling you things and out of place objects everywhere. While in purgatory there are no weapons, no zombies, and no points. It's really more of a discovery kind of place. There are also buildable items located in purgatory that you can grab. Once the new round starts, though, you are pulled out of purgatory and put back into the normal map, along with any items you find there. There's a lot in purgatory and even though this is a ""leak"" some of its is quite awesome and I really don't want to ruin it for you guys (trust me once you play it you'll agree with me). 

The next point are the ""varied zombie types"" within the map. The team wanted to do better than just add a zombie boss. There are actually 4 zombie type bosses throughout the entire map. The map is huge, mind you, and is divided quite liberally into 3 diverse sections and each section has a roaming ""boss"" (each one has their own abilities that differentiate themselves. But the idea is to fuck up trains, basically). There's also a fourth boss that comes every 4-6 rounds. Basically at the start of these rounds the entire team spawns at an inaccessible part of the map and stay there for the duration of the ""mob"" round. They are then swarmed by huge amounts of zombies going through everywhere (the zombies' health stays the same after round 15 though). There is, I believe, a cap at 50 zombies for that round. But the zombies spawn above you and at your sides. After the round you get a Max Ammo, a perk-bottle, and you're given about 45 seconds to Pack-a-Punch (this is the only way you can do so in the map though). 

The next bullet point is the side-quest. When we were approached by the zombie team with the rough concept for the map, they were very specific about the fact that it had to be in Alcatraz and follow a very specific chain of events. We were actually given story-boards with everything that was to happen. From what I can remember from the meeting the narrative within the map starts off with these 4 actors trying to escape Alcatraz and while they're trying to they start getting fractions of their memory back (remember I said they had amnesia). But there's this voice talking to them (pretty sure it wasn't Nolan North's character). And then it's gets really crazy. This voice (which the zombie team really never gave too much detail about during their visit) instructs the 4 mobsters to help these other characters escape from space. I might've missed some stuff since the only time I hadn't explained to me was when the zombie team came over and showed us the storyboards. But that's what I understood of it (was pretty confusing though). I don't know any steps in this side-quest (wasn't my job to do that) but I do know that purgatory and this buildable weapon has a lot to do with this side-quest. Again, I'm probably not 100% on target with this as it wasn't my job to make the narrative and I was only ""briefed"" on it sometime about 2 weeks ago. But what I can say is that's its EXTREMELY CONFUSING. 

Another cool feature we wanted to incorporate into the map was a great dynamic environment. Different parts of the map have different ""auras"". For example, there is plenty of fog on the outside areas of the map. And the environment changes. About every 10 minutes it starts raining in the map (with thunder). I know the environment triggers certain events but honestly I don't know the specifics. 

The main method of transportation within the map are zip-lines. Now we decided to put a very intricate ""network"" of zip lines. The player really has to know what zip line brings you where (since there's really zip lines in almost every room). But the idea with the zip lines was that you could get from one end of the map to the other in about a minute, without really skipping ""significant"" areas in the middle where you would want to be able to get stuff. 

Another ""creative direction"" we wanted to pursue was a strong horror/thriller aura to the overall map gameplay. We wanted the map to really scare you. A lot of the zombie spawns are in places you don't expect. We also made it so the behavior of the zombies isn't as scripted as in previous maps. One second the zombie can be walking and the next it can be full out sprinting at you. The map is also very scary in design. There are dead inmates everywhere and random loud scary noises. 

The map is also as historically accurate to Alcatraz as we could accomplish without sacrificing gameplay factors. Lots of the places we exact replicas of the island (especially the warden's quarters). Treyarch actually hired a historian to help guide the team. 

Another thing we were told to do by the zombies team was to not make the map too hard. So, what we did is make good weapons readily accessible and have a really good Sci-Fi esque weapons in the game. This one gun instantly ""vaporizes"" the zombies and turns them into this weird purple gas. It's almost instantly kills every single zombie within its range. We also made sure that not be too aggressive in early rounds. 

We also wanted to incorporate lots of guns fitting of the prohibition-era timeframe. For example, we included the tommy gun (Thompson), the Uzi; as well as more modern guns (I don't have the names ready off the top of my head). We also have the aforementioned gas gun (I remember the name was like a bunch of numbers). As for perks I'm not so sure about ""old perks coming back"" (although I do know that Flopper is being revived in a kind of nerfed form) but there are 2 new perks. The first I think is called bandolier. It gives your gun more bullets after killing zombies. You pick up these little packets off of dead zombies and it gives you more bullets (albeit at a slow pace). I know for a fact that we decided to balance the perk so that it only works on bullet-based weapons. The next perk in the map is called Two Times Tequila and what it does is that on certain weapons, If you buy them again or come across them on the mystery box, the gun is essentially doubled in all respects, granting x2 raw power, x2 ammo but the gun would cost x2 the original price and I'm pretty sure the perk is very expensive as well (not sure on the exact figure though). I do know that it stacks with all other existing perks (including the upgrade machine). 

And finally I know that avenged sevenfold wrote a song for the map. I'm not really into heavy metal so I can't judge whether its good or not (haven't even heard the song) but I know they were called up to record the song for the map. 

So, THAT'S ALL I KNOW. Again I won't reveal what my exact job was on the development of the map (for obvious reasons) but I didn't deal too much with gameplay aspects so the vast majority of the ""interesting"" stuff came from our original meeting with the zombie team and the subsequent team brainstorm sessions. But I've seen the map (haven't played it though) and am pretty confident that these features will stay true once the map is released. If you guys have any questions ask me (I don't know too much about reddit but I think you can reply to the post) and ill try to answer as many questions as I can.

Average player, 1.2 k/d, can have some pretty awesome games here and there.. I play only dom and FFA and in dom my average game would be say 25/15 playing the objective hard, really good games I'll go 35/10, best was 46/4.. In FFA, 95% of games I'm in top 3, and I win about 1:5.. 

Now, what I learned in launch week.. SMG's ruled, I pretty much ran the PDW exclusively with a variety of attachments, perks, lethals just trying to find what worked for *me* and that was what *worked* the first week. I also heard much bragging on the SCAR courtesy of reddit, so I had one class I ran with it as well (SCAR is at max level with all attachments available). The first few days, it was all about learning maps, spawns, routes etc and I wasn't too concerned about k/d, I had my frustrations with lag, rage quits, and everything else but was pretty much satisfied with the game.. I think if you KNOW the weaknesses of the game, SMG's vs AR's, camping, other misc *issues*, then play AROUND them, not AGAINST them. Honestly, after getting up to 1st prestige lvl 40 after the first week, I still would play MW3 more than BO2 and wasn't all that thrilled with the game.


Fast forward to last night, I played a few games of dom and was getting my butt HANDED to me like I had never played the game before.. Going 5/25, 10/30 etc, losing every gunfight, and was getting REALLY pissed off thinking it's all the game, OMG this game has so many issues, bettys everywhere, campers everywhere, screw this, this game sucks, the SAME things I heard everyone else complaining so much that they hated about the game and I was right there with them. So, I put MW3 in and played a few games, calmed down, put BO2 back in... 

Took a few minutes to re-analyze WHY I was getting my butt handed to me, realized it was ALL me and not the game leading to the poor gameplays, and then I made some class change setups thinking ok, if this (insert random complaint) is going on, then I need to do this to counter.. So, this is what I did..

1) I silenced every weapon, staying off the radar was something I VASTLY under estimated.. Not only for staying off the map, but for me, and playing to control the engagement, I suffered ZERO from taking the hit for lost damage ZERO.. ESPECIALLY when it came to a silenced AR vs silenced SMG which I say 90% of people running SMG's are running them silenced..

2) I started running engineer on all my classes.. I got really tired of getting killed by BB's.. Pro-tip #1, if you see a shock charge/betty/claymore sitting somewhere, chances are the person laying them down is close and if you know that, you can control the engagement a couple ways. A) shoot/hack/destroy the lethals or flank. However you want to go about it, but the situational awareness advantage has so much merit. Not to mention with so many random bettys laying around, 1 shot from a silenced weapon and +50 points doesn't suck, not to mention your likely denying someone else a kill. Again, this is what works for *ME*..

3) Assault rifles in BO2 are absolute MONSTERS if you play to their strengths.. SO much talk about the huge advantage of SMG's, small maps, and every other excuse you can imagine that is making 95% of people run SMG's.. I call complete, total, absolute BS on the SMG's ruling the game, a properly equipped AR and knowing how to hip fire and controlling your engagements is the whole key. A silenced AR vs a silenced SMG even in close quarters has the advantage going to the AR, more damage is more damage. The WHOLE key is situational awareness and controlling the engagement, PERIOD..

4) Run scorestreaks you can actually achieve, and use them effectively.. If your playing Dom, kill confirmed etc, someone is going to be running a UAV, if not multiples. A majority of the time, someone on the team has one up, so, use something else.. I personally run hellstorm/lightning/chopper (or vsat), I also run hardline because screw ghost and gimme the scorestreaks sooner.. With hardline on, and playing objectively hellstorm is ~4-5 kills and lightning (depending on caps/objective kills) is usually ~5 or 6, (95% of the time I get them both on the same kill) hellstorms are usually always 3+ kills for me, lightning strikes are usually 3-4 kills, so by the time I call those in plus a kill or 2 gets me my chopper or VSAT. IF you are running a VSAT, it is SO easy to cycle up through your scorestreaks it's ridiculous.. The main thing is, run SOMETHING you can use EFFECTIVELY whatever it is, UAV's, are NOT near as effective as people think IMHO..

5) I slowed WAY, WAY down in my gameplay.. I do NOT camp, EVER, but slowing down gives you a couple advantages, TOO many people run in this game, slow down and let them run to you where YOU control the engagements. I made a rule for myself that if I want to move a distance on a given map from where I'm at, I stop, count to five, then go. Why? Because 75% of the time I discovered someone else is running FROM that direction leading to a head on gunfight where you are 50/50 to win. If they're running AT you, you will likely win the VAST majority of the gunfights.. SLOW, DOWN!!

6) LAG.... I won't even touch that, I have a 100/20 connection with a 6ms ping, and I pull host probably 8/10 games.. In this game, the host definitely does NOT have the advantage, quite the opposite. The first 2 days the game came out, I had just as many nightmare games where I lost every gunfight I thought I should have won as the next person.. Honestly, I personally dont think the lag issues in this game are any worse than they were in MW3, you are going to win some gunfights you probably shouldn't have, just as you are going to lose some you shouldn't have. Deal with it.. I have also played on my other connection that is 40/20 but has a 75ms ping. I honestly can tell NO difference in playing on the 2 connections. NONE.. 

So, at the end of this long winded diatribe how did all of this affect my games after going a collective ~100/400 k/d to start the night??

I had 1 50+ kill game (50-8, my first EVER 50 kill game in any COD) I had 6 40+ kill games in Dom (best was 47-6, 9 caps, 12 defends), 10+ 30 kill games, and my worst game was 25-15 on a CRAP team, played the objective HARD and carried us to a win from 30 pts down at halftime. I also got my first 15+, AND 20+ killstreaks. In FFA's, I won 6 straight, my best was 30-5, worst was 30-10, but I didn't have a single game in 20+ that I had less than a 3:1 k/d.. I ran a silenced SCAR in 90% of the games, and was absolutely CRUSHING people, and I mean CRUSHING them, to the point multiple people were calling me a hacker/name calling etc.. I'm not just saying the SCAR is a beast in and of itself because the gun is only part of the equation, but in the hands of a good player, the SCAR or (any AR for that matter) is going to be a force to be reckoned with in this game..  

I am by NO means a beast of a player, average or slightly above at best.. My performance in those games was purely a result of thinking about how to play the game as dictated BY the game and figuring out where I could turn any disadvantages the game had into strengths I could us to MY advantage.. Changing my thinking made a the difference, HUGE difference because the perceived ""broken"" game I had played earlier didn't fix itself in the hour I wasn't playing..

TL;DR.. Black Ops 2 may have it's flaws, but the game isn't by any means the broken, unplayable game some make it out to be. It's the vast majority of the players playing the game are what's broken.. Change your way of thinking and playing the game, you will enjoy it much, much more!!!",,False,self,t5_2sqqn,False,,psn,True,t3_14c946,http://www.reddit.com/r/blackops2/comments/14c946/so_i_took_2_weeks_off_from_playing_black_ops_2/,

I know the concept of ""trolling"" is extremely popular right now, but to be honest it makes me sick. Since when was it the ""cool"" thing to do, to reduce little kids to tears and intentionally hurt people? The shit has got to stop. There has to be a line drawn somewhere, and I am calling on those of you who still have a bit of compassion to take a stand with me in drawing that line. 

For those who think trolling is just harmless fun: grow the fuck up. It isn't harmless. It is douchebaggery in its purest form. It doesn't make you cool. All it does is hurt another human being. How would you feel if this type of thing happened to your kid brother, your best friend, or heaven forbid... you? Would you still think it was funny? Your internet tough guy attitude might say ""yea, I would still laugh"", but inside we both know the truth. It's sad, but people have killed themselves over shit like this. Would you REALLY want that on your conscience just because you wanted to have a laugh?


Back during MW2, there was a guy by the name of Ken Burton who started a movement called the KEN Campaign. Keeping Everything Nice. Unfortunately, youtube fame took its toll and Ken seems to have forgotten about his campaign. During it's heyday it wasn't uncommon to see numerous people throughout a day of playing sporting the [KEN] tag. And those people had a mission. To have fun, and help out those who were being bullied/trolled (in most cases it's the same thing). Now, thanks to the ""leader"" having lost his way, the movement seems to be dead. But it still lives on in the hearts of decent people around the world. 

What I am proposing does not need a special clan tag, or emblem or anything else to ""show your support"". I honestly don't want to see anything that could be turned into shameless self promotion. You can show your support by standing up to these assholes. Report them (when appropriate), show their victims a bit of kindness, call the assholes out. Whatever it takes. 

Contrary to what many seem to think, the trolls ARE in the minority here. The majority of gamers aren't like that, nor do they find it amusing. Even the big names like MinnesotaBurnns are tiny compared to the rest of the community.  Sure he has over a million subscribers, but how many players are there? There was an estimated 7.5 MILLION copies sold on day 1 alone. By those figures alone, there are 6 people that don't support him for every 1 that does. If they can make their voices heard, so can we.

Equip two and chuck them into high traffic areas: 90% of the time you're going to hit someone. The effects last for an **extremely long time**, double if not triple the duration of a flash or concussion. While not all that bothersome to enemies, the long duration of effect almost guarantees that anyone you hit with an EMP grenade will die whilst under its effects granting you a steady stream of +50 assist points. 


You can do this all freaking day long on nuketown 24/7. I chuck two over the buses in opposite directions as soon as I leave the house. I get hits almost every time and assist kills seconds later. Bumps my score per game up by 1000+ easily.

We present to you: /r/reporttheboosters

We've reached out to the known Activision &amp; Treyarch employees with redditor accounts and ask that they forward this new subreddit on to the anti-cheat team over at Treyarch. Our goal is to give these people a  list of offenders to deal with in order to ultimately keep the game clean. 

We won't ban booster posts from /r/blackops2 but we encourage posting to /r/reporttheboosters in order to have a more comprehensive list.

Make sure you've used the in-game reporting tool as that is the recommended way to report boosters.

Enjoy! Please be civil as you go about this -- no need for pitchforks or witchhunts. The idea is for the system to do its work. Although boosters may currently soar above you in statistics and unlocks, they WILL ultimately fall and never play another game of Black Ops 2. Justice will be served in time.

Please review the sidebar in /r/reporttheboosters for more info.

Thanks,

However, no points are awarded for simply being in the hardpoint and gaining points for your team.

0 points per tick of points for your team while you are in the hardpoint

What if they changed it to something like:

150 points for capturing a hardpoint

5-10 points per tick of points for your team while you are in the hardpoint

It would cut down on people just hopping in and out of the hardpoint for points and would give incentives to people to actually stay in the hardpoint.

On top of that, what if they increased the points for your team gained based on how many people were in the hardpoint?  2 people would be 2 points, and I think capping it at 3 people, 3 points would be alright, to ensure games didn't end that quickly.  That, or increase the 250 point win mark to something higher.

Thoughts?

Edit: Let's say 100 points for cap, 5 points per tick.

Hey everyone,

Due to the recent developments and feelings people have in, and towards this subreddit I think it's time to open up dialog with everyone on what is working in the subreddit and what isn't. Also what needs to be changed regarding moderation from us the mods in order to satisfy what the community wants.

###Step 1: [Read the current rules here](http://www.reddit.com/r/blackops2/comments/133scw/rblackops2_rules/)
Best to be familiar with what we currently have now before voicing your opinions.

###Step 2: Be familiar with what I think the purpose of Reddit is, how I think Reddit should be moderated

Reddit is special in that the content you see on the site is largely moderated and chosen by the community. And it's chosen by upvotes and downvotes. That's a unique part of reddit in that really anything can be shared here, and if it's liked enough it gets pushed to the top. That's a generally good system.

This also has the added plus (or negative) of having a site where anyone can comment and share their opinions. This is good and bad depending on the situation. These comments are also moderated by the community. It's a shame when ""trolls"" or others post with not the nicest intentions, but that's an inherent element on a site like reddit. Not everyone has nice things to say.

Now of course there are restrictions on that, hence the rules. There's content that cannot be shared, content that is not supposed to be shared, and content that the community deems unfit to be shared. This subreddit has two such ""special"" content rules that fall outside the general reddit rules: memes and YouTube submission requirements.



###Step 3: Share your thoughts on what you would like to not see in this sub, and what you like to see

This is where you come in. Are you guys happy with the way we moderate the subreddit? We currently actively remove outright spam, off-topic submissions, personal information, memes, and YouTube videos that violate our submission guidelines.

Do you feel that we need to be removing/policing more? Do you feel our moderation is adequate where it's at right now? Or perhaps you're interested in seeing more things allowed such as the removal of the video submission guideline and allow memes?

The moderation team will listen to everyone said here and see if we can update our rules to better reflect what the community wants. We know a lot of people are upset with the direction this subreddit is going, but let's see if we can fix that.

At first I had the same reaction that many of you did, ""This thing is horrible, I can't possibly do this! Please buff!""

Now that I have used it extensively, I can honestly say it could be my favorite pistol. Once I got the hang I mostly come out positive, not only that but better than I usually do!

There is a specific attachment and perk combo that I use which I have found to be the most effective. For my perks I use Lightweight, Ghost,  Scavenger and Extreme Conditioning; and for my Attachments Long Barrel and Fast Mag. Throw in one EMP and you're golden. 

Throughout all my different trials this is what has worked the best. My tactic is a modified run and gun. I usually run straight to the enemy side find an enemy by himself and blast him away, reload and repeat. Now there are two different, both extremely effective, ways of gunning. The first is if you can catch an enemy unawares one shot will do from almost point blank. The second way is my personal favorite, this is what works when an enemy catches you head on. instead of trying to back off for cover run directly past them turn and unload your clip. Of course, you do not always have to run past them. Unloading all five shots will usually kill them from ~10-15 feet. Judge this situation and figure out what needs done. Also, you NEVER want to be out in the open! Stick to the parameter of the map and tight choke points.

Let's talk about attachments. I've tried all of them and long barrel and fast mag work best, it's the only way I've gotten any bloodthirsty medals. Fast mag is a MUST! You can't always be reloading 5 shots and use this gun well. Reflex sight is basically useless on this gun because the recoil is so great you can't possibly use it more effectively than the iron sights. Tac Knife is the other attachment many have used to get bloodthirsty, but at least for me it's too broken to use. I have gotten 4 stabs that do not kill my victim and then I die, so I choose not to use it. Duel wield is decent, you get a free fast mag, but I prefer one gun. You can try it, it may work for you.

I seriously love this gun. The better and faster you become, the more fun you will have. I had an enemy team raging so hard, they thought I was using a rapid fire controller!

Although quick disclaimer, if you're going to try and get gold, your K/D will suffer horribly unless you are a demigod. It's also frustrating.

**EQUIPMENT**

Concussion grenades or shock charges. Whatever floats your boat, the point is you're going to be behind people a lot, and chasing them is time consuming and always attracts attention. Lob a stun in front of their path and catch up to them. Smash 'em in the back. Keep in mind that Fast hands is pretty much ESSENTIAL for this to work. EMP's are also an option, because everyone loves points.

**GAME MODES**

Hardcore, it gives you the advantage of a 1 hit kill bash, but it also leaves you incredibly vulnerable, it's kind of a trade off. Play hardcore if you're comfortable, I found that ground war and other game modes posed too much frantic action as people seem to always get behind you. I leaned towards Chaos Moshpit near the end of my run as Hijacked and Nuketown are great one sided maps for channeling choke points and grabbing some much needed bashes. Also, keep in mind which maps would be good  for CQC and which wouldn't be.

**PERKS**

The build is definitely a perk heavy one. This is to maximize the effectiveness of the shield without the urge to rely on a secondary. You're working on the Shield, not your pistol. Keep it out.

Flak Jacket, I cannot stress how important this is. The dumb people will just shoot your shield hoping their bullets become magic, the smart people will evade and circle you. The very smart players will throw explosives at your feet. Flak jacket laughs at you pitiful attempts!

Lightweight / Extreme conditioning: You're gonna want to get into the action fast, or get round behind it. Either way, catch those fuckers. The speed boost will let you catch up to people quick enough so that people don't notice you lingering near their spawn. Sometimes flanking is the best option, instead of being the wall be the ninja. 

Fast hands: You want you concussions to land without you getting eaten apart by bullets in the process? This perk. Also essential.

Tactical mask: Like Flak jacket, they will also usually throw their tactical's at you in hope of slowing you down so they can run around and stab you in the back. Tactical mask laughs at you also. With these two perks you can become a far more formidable wall, although you may swap it out for Dead silence if you prefer or awareness if you're an idiot.

---

**Tactics!**

You will learn to love corridors and doorways, tight spaces are lovely. When someone is faced with an assault shield, they will do one of two things: Panic or run. Panic is noticeable by their frantic grenade throwing and jumping about while shooting your shield. Running is also smart, yet futile as you can just chase them down when they have nowhere to run. Avoid open areas as there will always be someone to your left with a nice lock on your hip or shoulder. Crouch a lot, if you didn't already know this that is. Encounter someone? Crouch. Bouncing betty? Crouch. Fucking leaf flies across the scr- FUCKING CROUCH THAT SHIT

Careful when running towards the panicking target as you will be exposed, slowly crouch walk towards them and it will freak them out and likely trap them in a corner. Shield bash. Also never put your shield down. It's just not worth it, a gust of wind could go by and then it's gone and you're stuck with a knife. Sweet. Be patient! that's also important, try and outsmart your opponent and use the environment to your advantage.

For example, look at [THIS DIAGRAM](http://imgur.com/quCP4) of a certain area near the C flag on the map RAID. Say you just ran out and saw an enemy by taking the brown line he spotted you as shown by the red lines (his peripheral vision) which color path SHOULD you take when using the shield? 

If you said blue, you're correct. Get the fuck out of there, you're a sitting duck otherwise. Never bring a knife to a gunfight, but you don't even have a knife you have a lump of bulletproof plastic. Albeit it can deflect bullets but you can only sit there and absorb for so long before he tries a new tactic, switch the battle into your favor and make him think you're retreating. (But while retreating keep your face to him to avoid death) Stick behind the cover, he will probably run straight past you expecting a pursuit, catch him back up an hit him in the back. Use a concussion to avoid him turning around. Magic right?

The assault shield can be both offensive and defensive depending on how you play it, although it's not really good at both. Push your way into corridors to literally push the enemy back into spawn. Your teammates (should) take advantage of this and close in on them too. Work with your team, direct fire towards yourself when at long range gunfights (having a gold shield makes this bit cake) Stick near teammates as they can do some of the killing for you while you give them the finger behind your shield. Instinct says shoot the shield, so they do. Don't know why, but they do. USE THIS TO YOUR ADVANTAGE.

And finally, be smart. This tip also follows into my next part as I've seen some poor fuckers not handling me very well during my time so here's some tips and tricks on..

**HOW TO HAND AN ASSAULT SHIELDERS ASS TO THEM**

* Step 1: Don't panic
* Step 2: Don't fucking panic
* Step 3: Pump some bullets into the shield, around eye level. This may seem useless but trust me, when using an assault shield the moment you get hit by a bullet your vision is clouded by cracks and shit. Mothafuka whaddap? If they can't see they can't hit.
* Step 4: Flash, stun. Disorient. There is never a better time, if he can't turn around when you're initiating part 5 then you have a severe advantage. Tac mask? No problem, you can still win.
* Step 5: CIRCLE, confuse him. Can't circle? See bonus step. His vision is already crowded by cracks and blurs, you've turned the tables already. Unless you're on hardcore it will require 2 hits to kill and if you're on the offense you have a better chance than the blind guy. If you manage to knife him in the back well done you don't suck!
* Bonus step: In a tight corridor? Can't circle? Lie down. Shielders are aiming at approximately chest height when crouch walking, if their vision is obscured they will flail about in circles wondering where you went. If they're aiming up they won't hit you, wait till they turn and knife em. Congratulations!
* Extra bonus step: Are there multiple enemies in the area? Ignore the shielder. Unless they are right up in your grill they can't do shit to you. Beware the tomahawk carrier though, do not stand still when taking out his friends. Get rid of his teammates first and then choose to engage or piss off.

For whatever the reason Treyarch was in the giving mood and you can take advantage of this with some simple tools.

**1. Follow your Challenges by Nearest.**   
If you own a smartphone, or tablet download the Elite app

&gt;[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.activision.elite&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwyLDEsImNvbS5hY3RpdmlzaW9uLmVsaXRlIl0.)

&gt; [Apple](https://itunes.apple.com/app/call-of-duty-elite/id471388381?mt=8) (Thanks [itsme-p](http://www.reddit.com/r/blackops2/comments/174tc2/psa_getting_the_most_out_of_your_double_xp_weekend/c827snz))  

The reason you need the app is because the [Elite website](https://elite.callofduty.com/player/home) kind of sucks, bottom line is that it DOES NOT have the ability to sort your challenges by nearest. In my eyes this is essential.

[Have your tablet or smartphone next to you as you play](http://i.imgur.com/G6UP8EP.jpg). Now you can follow your closest challenges and complete them as soon as Double XP is live. *I envy those of you who have never used this before as I'm sure you'll find a plethora of 95% challenges prime for the taking*. 

**2. Break down your goals to make them more achievable.**  
This part is kind of common sense and goes with my first tip. Your first intention may be to make a class with all the perks, weapons, and attachments that you need challenges in. This is not fun and made me horrible. Choose one or 2 challenges at a time. Don't rely 100% on the nearest challenges either, you can use the app or Barracks In-game to view your other challenges. My suggestion: Attachments, Scorestreaks, GameModes, Prestige. Check all of these challenge hubs for easily obtainable and quick challenges. You want to identify the ones that will be giving 2.5, 5k or 10k XP.

**3. Double XP is in a couple days. Start saving your big challenges.**  
This is up to you, but if you are close to a gold gun, or a diamond class, or max weapon prestige... wait. As soon as 2XP goes live you can get that last blood thirsty, get a 10k and/or 5k and watch them double up to 20-30k in one match.

**4. If you are using Care Packages please realize you need the scorestreaks unlocked if you want them going toward your challenges.**  
 Getting a swarm in a care package does nothing for your challenges if you don't have it unlocked. 

**5. Use emp grenades: 50 xp (x2 on the weekend) per assist will give you tons of xp.**  ([Credit: RoCz](http://www.reddit.com/r/blackops2/comments/174tc2/psa_getting_the_most_out_of_your_double_xp_weekend/c827den))  
 I sometimes get enough assist by 2 emp grenades to call in a uav without firing my weapon once. 

**6. I recommend using the UAV and CUAV as well.**  ([Credit: TheGinjaNinja](http://www.reddit.com/r/blackops2/comments/174tc2/psa_getting_the_most_out_of_your_double_xp_weekend/c827mlw))  
 Easily attainable streaks and will give you tons of Score and XP for the assist points.

Got some Good Info (DLC Plans, Activision-Microsoft Contract, Trip Cap Challenge Help &amp; More!)",258,40,92,http://www.reddit.com/r/blackops2/comments/193h43/i_partied_up_with_vahn_last_night_for_a_while_got/,"So last night the Treyarch Twitter tweeted saying David Vonderhaar was accepting invites to play some PS3 Black Ops 2 . I have a parody account called “Im-David-Mason” so I figured I’d take a stab and request him on that account for a joke. He accepted AND tweeted my PSN out to his followers [Link Here](https://twitter.com/DavidVonderhaar/status/305076408391180288) Resulting in a MASS amount of spam requests and messages of people thinking **I** was Vahn (Good ol' David told me to act like I was so I did haha)

Anyway, back on topic, I’d played with him previously about 6 months ago and what he did is play with almost everyone, tell them  he’s  gotta go then play with the people he liked the most. I think that was his intention this time however we went on a winstreak the entire night [Tweet Here](https://twitter.com/Treyarch/status/305093015188406272) and I along with 4 other people ended up playing with him for around an hour and a half or even 2 hours. During this time we slayed, queried and laughed. 

The whole time I was in “Dissecting” mode and trying to take tiny details to share with the greater community, as I think anything he said to us (being just another bunch of twitter followers/community members) could be passed on to you.  Here’s some info I was able to gather from the session (Feel free to overlook ones that don’t interest you):

•	**Kill confirmed Score**– We were playing Carrier KC and we were discussing  how KC plays. We brought up the fact that a Team Mate confirming a kill was really low,25, and he said that pre-launch they had tried it with 50 score and it was scorestreak  *OVERLFOW*.  That does make sense, right? Let’s say team mates confirm 10 of your tags, that’s 500 score as opposed to the 250 we have now. That’s a lot more score to go towards scorestreaks.

•	**Domination Trip Cap Challenge** - We were dominating on Hijacked and I brought up that on my main account I have 12/13 of the Domination Challenges, the one missing being the Trip Cap Challenge. Vahn seemed excited to answer this as he claims he’s done it 4 (Seems legit) He said the trick is to play Overflow with a 6 man party and 2 men overlooking each flag. I’ll test this out but it looks possible, it’s a small map..


•	**SMG Balance** - I can’t remember how this conversation arose but David was explaining how they had put a lot more enthusiasm on SMG’s this game (which anyone can understand and see) by comparing BO2’s SMG’s to BO1’s. Think about it. Scorpion vs Skorpion.. 74u vs PDW 57.. MSMC vs MPL. There’s a clear difference.  On a side note he said he’s glad the community doesn’t think there’s a SUPER-gun in this game, like the Famas. While the PDW/FAL/870 are irritating I think they lack OPness compared to the Famas pre-patch, so he’s on to something.

•	**PS4/720 DLC Contract** - We all know Microsoft has a deal with Activision so Xbox users get the DLC first. The topic on hand was about our excitement for Revolution on the 28th and I asked about the Contract and whether it will carry on to the Next Gen Consoles. Vahn said he doesn’t know but the contract has been in place for years and (Don’t quote this) could carry on for more. However he emphasised that the *real* source for this info would be OneOfSwords, Activision’s PR. His podcast could have the answer in the future. I kinda hope they tell us at E3 though.. 

**DLC** - This is the best topic we got out of the night. I really hope this is true, as it excites *and* disappoints me. Like I said above, we were discussing DLC and cody-4-24 asked if there would be more Weapon DLC . Vahn said no but.. I don’t know, it seemed like a dodgy one..  I think if they WERE planning on releasing more, surely Vahn wouldn’t spill the beans a few months early to some random followers..
  Secondly, after we got that answer out of him, I asked if they would add any other DLC mechanics, like Game modes (I probably should have asked about Scorestreaks/perks/equipment too…) and he went quiet.. Now keep in mind he could have just muted his mic to talk to someone and didn't hear me but after a few seconds someone asked him to help plant a bomb and he said “I got it” or something like that, which makes me think he was listening, just didn't want to answer..  Anyone now hoping for the return of War(Which he has talked about) ? Or even a new Party Game? Remember how pre-BO2  OneOfSwords did a podcast where they talked about having AGR/Claw like vehicles &amp;EMP grenades as a Party Game?..


•	**Future Prestiges** - Y’know how there was the whole scandal where people could get to 12th Prestiges (Can they still?)? According to Vahn that was partly to weed out the hackers/modders who went to 12th. Now I don’t know if this is true or a cover up to a minor glitch but it seems to have worked.. However he said they have **NO** plans to add more prestiges like MW3. Again, not sure if true or just not telling us Yet..

* **Reporting** - I added this one one as it's not really that important but our last game of the night (Yemen SnD) Some guy was rocking a dick emblem and Vahn said he'll have his emblem privileges gone by Monday. I can't say if he did get them removed but Vahn was strict about emblems, even checking *our* emblems to make sure we had no offensive ones. Looks like Treyarch **DOES** Actually try to catch those guys..


**To Those Asking About Lag** Really guys? How immature would it be to play with a Dev and just complain? He's giving time to talk to the community and have a good time and all you wanna do is bitch? I think one reason I did play with him for 2 hours was because we got along, if someone started being a prick they'd be kicked. They get enough on Twitter/Reddit. 


Well Reddit, there ya go! Any questions? You know where to ask! :D

1360952189.0,215,self.blackops2,18lbhn,Bootcamp: I will improve you K/D. ,289,74,118,http://www.reddit.com/r/blackops2/comments/18lbhn/bootcamp_i_will_improve_you_kd/,"[Part 2](http://www.reddit.com/r/blackops2/comments/18nowk/bootcamp_i_will_improve_your_kd_part_2)

[Part 3](http://www.reddit.com/r/blackops2/comments/18s1ct/bootcamp_i_will_improve_your_kd_part_3)
************


I was always been an average to above-average player in COD, going back to COD4, MW2, MW3, and in BO2. After 60 hours of BO2, my K/D was 1.2. After 200 hours of MW3, my K/D was 1.3. Not terrible, but not great either. So I set out to see if I could create a series of training exercises that would dramatically improve my ability. **My K/D after completing these Bootcamp training exercises has gone up to 2.0 and beyond.** 

* If you complete this Bootcamp, I will improve your K/D by 50-100%. 
* If you are a sub-1.0 player who generally struggles, I can double your K/D. 
* If you are already an average player with a low 1.x K/D, I can get you close to 2.0. 
* If you are already a solid 1.5-2.0+ player, well, I don’t know, but I think you might benefit as well. 

The idea behind these exercises is to create a series of stress tests that will put you at significant disadvantages in most situations. These stress tests are paired with specific tactical goals that you must consciously strive to implement into your play-style. You will be broken down, and then built back up. There will be severe limitations on your class setups, and you will die a lot. Many of the exercises will seem like common sense, or concepts that you already utilize in your gameplay, but try to actively concentrate on the exercises, even if they seem simple. 

After completing the Bootcamp, you will have stronger fundamentals in gun-on-gun engagements, will be able to win more engagements even when you are at a disadvantage, and will be better equipped to play objective game modes. 

 **Anyone interested?** Please check in below, and complete the following steps in this Part 1 of the Bootcamp. If people are interested, I will update with Part 2 in a day or so. 

.....

**Step 1: Take inventory.** If you don’t already have a Call of Duty: Elite account, sign up online and record the following stats: your time played, your overall K/D, as well as specific K/Ds based on your most used/best weapons, and specific game types including Free For All, Team Death Match, and Kill Confirmed, and monthly/weekly stats. This will serve as your baseline. 

**Step 2: Select your weapons.** For this Bootcamp, I recommend that you select one Assault Rifle, and one SMG that you will use throughout. In general you should choose two fully automatic weapons and avoid burst and single fire guns. Make sure you have all of the attachments unlocked.

* Recommended ARs: MTAR, M-27, SCAR, AN-94.  
* Recommended SMGs: PDW and MSMC. These are the gold standards of SMGs, although the MP7, Scorpion, Vector, or Peacekeeper will suffice.
If you have a go-to weapon that you are very familiar with, I recommend you use it, provided that it is not a burst or single fire weapon.

**Step 3: Tear down your loadout.** This will introduce you to the idea of restrictive stress tests, although this particular exercise is not that difficult. It will get much worse. Create two new classes and equip only the following items:

* (AR), Quickdraw, Stock, Lightweight, Toughness, Dexterity (6 slots)
* (SMG), Quickdraw, Lightweight, Toughness, Dexterity (5 slots)

Do NOT equip a secondary, any equipment, launcher, wildcards, or anything else. This will force you to focus only on the primary weapon. Yes you will be at a disadvantage whenever the enemy has air support, but you won’t be distracted. The idea is to get used to using less than all 10 slots in the Pick-10 setup.

With these setups, play through at least 3 games of FFA, at least 3 games of TDM, and at least 3 games of KC, *in that order* (FFA, TDM, KC), *with each weapon*. I will refer to this later as a ""3x3""; this is the basic unit of the Bootcamp. Less than full games don't count (i.e. joining mid game or getting disconnected). You might want to switch between AR and SMG based on the map size, but I found it was better to stick with one weapon through each 3x3. The key here in this introduction is to become familiar with each weapon and its recoil and handling. 

**Step 4: Tactical Exercises.** These are relatively simple in this Part 1/Introduction. In general, you are going to be fast-moving, and able to react quickly given that you are using every speed-based item in each setup. This is not much of a 'stress test,' except for the following:

* If you typically use Optical Sights, you’re going to have to get used to using iron sights. It may be difficult, but if you use the MTAR, SCAR, PDW, or MSMC, it shouldn’t be a problem as all have excellent iron sights. 
* If you normally use a silencer to stay off the mini-map, you’re not going to like this. Enemies will flock to you like a moth to a flame when you fire your weapon. Use that to your advantage, and recognize that enemies will run at you. 
* Focus on killing the first enemy you see with the first half of your clip, and killing the second enemy who rushes your location thereafter with the second half of your clip. Make it a point NOT to reload after every engagement, provided that you have more than half a mag left. 
*When you reload, do so behind cover. Not near cover, or running to cover. Behind. Cover. Preferably while crouching or prone.

Reload syndrome is something that probably hurts people more often than it helps – i.e. you probably die more often while reloading than you die from running out of bullets mid-engagement. Actively focus your attention on using a single magazine for MORE than one gun engagement. Actively refocus your attention several times in each game of the 3x3 on NOT reloading. Make it a mini-game. How many enemies can you kill with a single mag? 

Be judicious with you gun-fire, and burst. The goal right now is not to “play better” but it’s to play with the tactics described in mind. If you kill two enemies and run out of bullets on the third, who kills you, that's ok. As I said earlier, Bootcamp will get much harder.

1362091721.0,210,self.blackops2,19fbb4,A Guide to Weapon Mastery,240,30,49,http://www.reddit.com/r/blackops2/comments/19fbb4/a_guide_to_weapon_mastery/,"My Thoughts and Advice for Weapon Mastery

Some of this may seem like common sense, or be repetitive when it comes to certain advice. I completed the Weapon Mastery challenge last night and would like to share my opinions/techniques for anyone else suffering through this rewarding grind. I had 8d 11h played by the time I completed it, after reaching Prestige Master around 6d played. I usually play by myself.

Why Do It?

I feel it increases your overall skill level. Using less competitive weapons forces you to develop smarter tactics, stronger situational awareness, and heightened precision. When you start winning gunfights reliably with guns other than the MSMC and FAL, you become that much more lethal when you employ them (or whichever other weapons you prefer and do well with consistently). It also promotes some perspective: Maybe you should have more respect for that guy you see running around with an Assault Shield or Tac 45 or Crossbow. Maybe the reason you are doing so well is because there exists such a discrepancy in the competitive edge offered by non-""Power"" weapons. As a corollary, good luck not getting frustrated. I often said, ""Come on give me a break, I'm just going for headshots, no need to try!"". The whole point is that you've increased the difficulty level. It's satisfying. I have an obsessive nature, so I only got dismayed infrequently - and there is always the option to switch to a ""tryhard"" class. But you may find that considering the time investment this achievement takes, you don't want to be wasting potential kills/headshots by using a gun you've already gotten Gold or Diamond. Oh, and please don't constantly brag in lobbies about which guns you have completed. That's what your Showcase and Call Sign are for. 

Headshot Challenges in General:

Some people advocate just ""doing well"" and playing comfortably with a gun, and the headshots will follow. Though this approach may be less demanding, I feel it is inefficient (outside of weapons with high, predictable vertical recoil like the KAP-40). When I first began an active pursuit of this challenge, I realized that I almost always aim for the chest. It turns out that with enough practice, shooting enemies in the head actually does kill them just as fast if not faster than aiming for the chest. There will be times when you fail to get the kill because a few crucial rounds fly beside or over your enemy's head and they consequently have enough time to kill you. At least the headshot sound-effect is cool (when the game actually registers your headshot as a headshot!) I promise that the number of times you apparently get ""ripped off"" is balanced out by how many fluke headshots you will get when pre-firing or spraying. But really, use discretion. Make a commitment to ALWAYS taking the ""free"" headshot. I mean people who aren't moving, or are stationary (for example people laying down on an objective looking the other way, or people that are planting/defusing bombs and not spinning like a top). Furthermore, when confronting multiple enemies, kill the first one as fast as possible, then finish the second with a headshot. Nothing worse than missing an easy double kill because you screwed up the first because of your greed for a headshot, trust me.

Game Types:

For Headshots: I absolutely love FFA. It is my gametype of choice on any given day. I feel playing with a team in public lobbies is 9 times out of 10 a boring and predictable affair (unless you're good friends with them). If you've never played FFA on BLOPS2, you're going to find there's a rather steep learning curve. But once you figure out the spawning patterns, you will quickly be engineering the highest number of player engagements per minute, consistently, of any gametype (outside of certain versions of Nuketown). A further benefit is that the majority of engagements are in CQC, which makes getting the headshot that much easier.

For One Shot Kills: SVU, M1216, S12 - take them to Hardcore. Period. I did the M1216 2 nuketown weekends ago. Even on that map, you're looking at 50 kills a game with no more than 10 being 1 shot kills. To optimize your time spent, play Hardcore. Other snipers and shotguns: FFA. If you really can't quickscope whatsoever, I recommend Demolition for sniping since the spawns are almost always static, and many of the maps in that rotation have favourable sight lines. The XPR-50 is an incredibly powerful weapon when employed correctly, but take your time with it. If you have any kind of time to take the kill, aim for the upper chest or head. 

For the Combat Knife: I recommend FFA as well, particularly Standoff. The major buildings have 2-3 spawn points very close by, meaning you can flit in and out of the building in a stealthy manner and rack up kills as well as the necessary bloodthirsties. Not to mention revenge spawns make the Backdraft challenge (kill someone with the knife then use their weapon to kill them again) that much easier. This Revenge spawn mechanic is another reason why FFA shines for gun challenges, since SMGs, Pistols, and Shotguns require Revenge kills as well. Running into multiple enemies at once or in quick succession invariably and frequently in FFA. Also excellent for the Double Kill challenges on most weapons.

For the Assault Shield: Many, many people advocate Hardcore since it is a 1 bash kill but... considering how difficult it is to get close enough without dying when you have 30 HP yourself, I advise against it heavily. Stick to FFA, HQ, or Domination, where flanking can be done effectively. You want to surprise people with the shield as much as possible. I recommend using Fast Hands and Tactician. However, lobbies will catch on and make Tactical Mask classes, so be prepared to leave after a few games and find more unsuspecting victims. Another strategy for the 100 kills is running with the Five Seven. Shoot your foe 2 times in the chest outside of very close range, swap to your shield, and they will be a 1 bash kill.

For the Executioner: I advise a rushing class that uses the Tactical Insertion to flank on objective gametypes such as Domination and Demolition. You do NOT want to get into head on confrontations with this weapon if you want the few extra moments a sneak-attack provides for the precision necessary for a clean headshot. FFA still works nicely, especially on Hijacked.

For the Crossbow and Ballistic Knife: Sticks and Stones, period. I have 90% accuracy with the crossbow, and I found it _extremely_ difficult to attempt my Bloodthirsty in a regulation match. Admittedly, you can run a primary and scavenge kills with that weapon to replenish your bolts. Personally, I recommend doing this weapon all in one sitting. Playing Sticks and Stones for a few hours straight to amass the 300 kills will get your technique tuned to a fine point, then it's a matter of getting that Bloodthirsty while you're still hot. Another thing I noticed is that Sticks and Stones is full of casual gamers and guest accounts, some which aren't moving - I don't advocate signing in another controller and boosting with your own split-screen account... but if other people are doing it, why not kill their stationary targets?

Primary Weapons:

Work from class to class. This benefits you since you won't experience disruption in your playstyle - the transition from straight rushing with a shotgun to playing much more conservatively with a LMG will adversely affect your gameplay. Furthermore, the difference in movement speeds and ADS times won't throw you off as badly. This element shouldn't be underestimated, and comes into play again when considering the apparent necessity of the Stock attachment on ARs and LMGs.

The first piece of advice I have is that while you are completing the No Perks and No Attachment Challenges for any Primary Weapon, take advantage of the ample free space in your class, and equip the SMAW or FHJ. The biggest mistake I made was saving the launchers as the final category. It is much more efficient to unlock the camouflages while you're still working on primary weapons.

My style was picking my favourite 2 weapons from a category. I'd do one of them first, and save the other for the last weapon. This seemed to help with any kind of frustration level. Knowing you will have an easy time rounding out the class is beneficial. 

Notes on Sniper Rifles:

Bloodthirsties: Play aggressively for your first kill or two, then sit back and be that camping asshole everyone hates. The sightline from the A-side garage to the C-side garage on Nuketown resulted in almost all of my sniper bloodthirsties. 

The best part of this category is that although sniping is difficult, none of these weapons requires any perks or attachments to be used to lethal effect. The No Perk/No Attachment challenges are a breeze.

Notes on Assault Rifles:

If you have trouble with an iron sight, use the reflex sight. I enjoyed the smiley face reticle, since it is round and fits snugly over the head of my enemies. The idea is to be loud and proud, rush in and get those headshots as soon as possible. In this category, I recommend getting the headshots done on a weapon, then moving on to the next, then starting over and doing all of the No Attachment/No Perk challenges in order. This way you avoid the aforementioned issue with your accuracy that will result in constantly switching back from having a Stock to not having one. The SMR should never be put into Select Fire in my opinion. Get your trigger finger warmed up and steal 1 shot headshot kills from across the map with this high damage beast. You'll need that finger for the pistols eventually. I found the headshots on the AN-94 were ridiculously easy with the Select Fire attachment. 2 quick bursts to the head that have basically zero recoil, and you've got yourself a kill. The Swat and M8A1 excel for the same reason when it comes to headshots. For Longshots I recommend: Grip, Select Fire (if it isn't a burst weapon), and the ACOG sight. Play Ground War or Hardcore. A common sightline that is excellent for longshots is from the window overlooking C dom closest to the gas station on Standoff, over to the statue and tank. I usually sit back near the tank and just wait for people to look out of that window. Be discerning, if you're in a lobby that's going to put you into Slums or Hijacked or Grind or Plaza, back out. Another excellent sightline is between the window and the perch on either side of B Dom on Mirage. A final sightline that works well is on the basketball court side of Raid, between the apartment window and the rock garden. Keep these angles in mind when using the LMGs as well.

Notes on LMGs:

These guns are extremely powerful, but when you're running them without Perks and Attachments, are much too slow to compete in 1v1 combat. I would advise Domination or Demolition, and holding down sightlines in a support role to rack up your kills quickly. If you're a Hardcore fanatic, slap on the Variable Zoom attachment, camp sightlines in Hardcore, and pick off easy 1 bullet headshots with your pseudo-sniper rifle. The LSW is an under-rated gem in my opinion, it puts people down with frightening speed.

Notes on SMGs:

Easiest guns in the game to do anything with in almost every scenario. Vector in Select Fire and Chicom out of the box dominate for headshots. With the other ones, make sure you aren't running Toughness if you're using them ADS, otherwise, hipfire in the general vicinity of your enemy's head and watch the camos unlock as fast as you can find people to kill. Skorpion is a pea-shooter no matter what, so always run it Silenced as a Stealth class in my opinion. Treat the Peacekeeper as an AR and run it with Toughness and Grip... It's basically a M27 clone in that regard. 

Notes on Shotguns:

KSG with Quickdraw = quickscoping with iron sights. If that's your thing, you're going to annihilate the competition. The Remington is so easy to use it's ridiculous. To be super obnoxious, run shotguns as rushing classes with Fast Hands and use a bunch of tacticals, or C4. I found the S12 benefitted from Extended Clip more than Fast Mags. Make sure you always ADS the M1216.

1348763461.0,199,self.blackops2,10ki8w,A summary of tweets a couple of major Youtubers have posted today. Lots of new info.,222,23,149,http://www.reddit.com/r/blackops2/comments/10ki8w/a_summary_of_tweets_a_couple_of_major_youtubers/,"Apparently, these Youtubers have all been playing BO2 for the last month but have been
under an NDA. I guess it got lifted today.
For those who don't/can't access Twitter, this is what they posted. Will update as they post more.

Hutch: 

* One thing I'll say without you asking is if you expect to get scorestreaks in obj games from just slaying, you're gonna have a bad time.

* The Remington shotty is like the stakeout. Except it's good. Great range, 8 shots, 1 shot kills fee days.

* Sniping is CoD4 status. Ballista iron sights are ROUGH. A lot harder than WaW unscoped bolts.

* YY is back. Exactly like BO1.

* Multi Team Deathmatch. Is. Fucking. Fun. Played it 3 teams of four on a tiny map. It was straight up bananas. Nonstop action.

* Hard point will be where the montage guys go. It's very similar to drop zone, just no care packages.

* 32 layers for emblem editor. Artists will have fun.

* The prestige icons are legit. I think you will all agree.

* 10th prestige is a flaming gold skull with a burn mark (if I remember correctly).

* I still think a lot of people will run Ghost, but not as many as BO1. Pick 10 really changes the game. Lots. Of. Variety.

* Sensitivity now scales differently. 1-14. If you play on 5 now, for example, it translates to about 7 in this game. I love this feature.

* To be more specific about sensitivity. 14 is now the highest, but it's the equivalent to what 10 is now. Lets you fine tune your choice.

* SMG's suffer a LOT of damage drop off, but are lethal up close. They did a good job catering each gun class to its actual role. 

* Sound whoring. Footsteps seem a little louder than BO1, but the game itself has a lot more going on that drowns it out.

* Rapid Fire on the SMG's is leeeethal. However, past a very short range they are highly ineffective. Nice balance there.

* The MMS (X-Ray scope) was good, but not OP. Only works if people aren't moving.

* The Thermal Scope, for once, is awesome. Green background, players highlighted in orange, can still see them fine if they're Cold Blooded.

***

TmarTn:

*  I've played 100+ hours of #BlackOps2 multiplayer and 25+ hours of #BlackOps2 zombies over the past month.

* And my NDA has been lifted, so I can answer any questions you guys have, apart from some MP maps and Zombies. Those are still top secret :D

* Rejoin last played lobby ON [OFF] - This is a feature. You're welcome YouTubers. You can now find your perfect lobby with ease.



* There is no nuke, MOAB, or hidden killstreak.

* Time to kill is a nice medium between MW3/BO1

* Tons of epic new camos: carbon fiber, cherry blossom, skulls, gold, and hidden ones. Can be put on primaries, secondaries, riot, launchers

* DSR50, not the Ballista, will be the sniper weapon of choice.

* Zombies has 3 modes as of now: Tranzit, Survival, Grief.

* Tranzit: Expansive map, story mode. Bus takes you to 5 different areas. What you saw in the trailer yesterday

* Survival: Same regular zombies. One area, last as long as possible.

* Grief: 4z4. Humans vs Humans vs Zombies. Humans cannot kill each other, but can ""fuck with each other"" thru traps/grief events.

* All the weapons are super balanced. Nothing is too OP at this point in time. I do have my favs, you'll see them in my class setup videos.

* Some maps are interactive. Cargo has moving shipment crates. Express has a bullet train that runs you over/cuts off spawns. Pretty cool.

* Lightening strike is everything an airstrike should have been in CoD. Three point target, drops bombs immediately. Very minor delay.

* When you prestige, weapon and challenge progression DO NOT reset.

* Prestige emblems are the best out of any CoD thus far.

* 10th prestige is a flaming skull with half of its face burned. Kinda like two face.

* Sensitivity: now 1-14. 14 is the same as 10 in previous games. More tiers in-between, allowing you to tune your sens even more.

* Zombies: you can do head shots only, magic items off (mystery box, perk machines), and you can elect to start at round 1, 5, 10, 15, or 20.

* ou no longer have to hold X to pick up Combat Axes, you just have to walk over them. That + Scavenger replenishing = epic. @ONLYUSEmeBLADE

* Theater mode has dolly cam, in-lobby game save feature, and new ""highlight"" feature. With the press of a button, it will cut together all of your killing/objective events in said game into a highlight reel.

* Emblem editor: 32 layers, color wheel, infinitely more shapes/graphics, can adjust transparency.

* #BlackOps2 has one of the best spawn systems I've seen. Not too quick to flip, never got spawned in front of somebody.

* Best pistol: Beretta. 3-round burst, like the Raffica from MW2

* You can play combat training and earn multiplayer XP. Can only rank up to level 10 though.

* There's a moustache reticle in #BlackOps2

* Yes, gold camo returns in #BlackOps2. Gold primaries, gold pistols, gold crossbow, gold launchers, gold riot shields.

* Objective markers DO fade out when you're aiming down site at them. Just like in BO1.

* The knife lunge range in #BlackOps2 is HORREBDOUS. You have to be point blank.


***

Optic Nadeshot:

* League play is being heavily emphasized by Treyarch. Your league ranking and medal will be on your playercard.

* Prestige icons are the best looking they've ever been. This will be the first time I prestige in a long long time.

* Black Ops 2, IMO, feels more like MW3. Only difference is player movement is slower then before. Game felt very smooth.

* The league play icons will literally MAKE YOU want to be in the highest league. Seeing that icon next to your name will add much motivation.

* Tons of new camos. Ronin, Carbon Fiber, Skulls, Art of War...just to name a few. More info on that later from me.

* Every weapon, perk, attachment, and score streak has a counter. The game is very balanced. They put a lot of though into it.

* Sniping is fun, but challenging. The Unscoped Ballista takes A LOT of skill. Will be hard for most snipers to get used to.

* The DSR-50 is the best sniper IMO, also looks badass with an amazing sound to it.

* Recoil. There is significant recoil in Black Ops 2. Gun WILL take skill.

* Theater now allows you to spectate FIRST PERSON POV of every player in your lobby. Big improvements made.

* Reticle customization has never been so lucrative. Treyarch had fun with it and add plenty of reticles just for the lulz.

* The eSports initiative is very important to Treyarch and they are offering unbelievable support for our community #LeaguePlay

* With the new Pick 10 system, there will be DEFINED player roles once again. Slayers, support, objective...etc.

* There is a mustache reticle in Black Ops 2, trust me, that had a lot of fun with the game. Such awesome guys over at @Treyarch studios.

* Jump shooting in Black Ops 2 didn't feel too beneficial. Drop shooting on the other hand felt amazing. We'll see how it feels with time...

* In my honest opinion, League Play will be the single most impacting feature added to Black Ops 2 #TheFutureIsBlack

* Aim assist still exists for snipers. Time to put that rumor to bed. Like I said, sniping is challenging, still fun though.

* Time overtime rounds are automatically added to Capture the Flag. Perfect for the competitive guys, 2 sided domination as well.

* You can bring multiple people in your theater lobby to show off your clips. They really thought of everything.

***

Ernest Le:

* High scorestreaks are VERY hard to get. If you play for KD, play the objective. You'll look ridiculous with half the score as the OBJ guy.

* As it stands, I can see all of us hating UV rays by the first week. The Guardian is extremely useful and annoying. Also nets easy points.

* Fast Hands is a must for combat axes and C4s. Throwing fast is deadly. C4 is dirty, just ask @codblack1ce

* IMHO, GHOST will be overused. It's powerful, and UAVs are the first scorestreak unlock. Lots of UAVs will be ran, especially for assist pts.

* Hunter Killer is the new RCXD. Get ready to pull your hair out.

* Back to Ghost - it might be overused, but you won't get your streaks trying to avoid the objective. You get mad pts for team playing.

* Skorpion EVO II is dirty. Very fast rate of fire and controllable. MSMC is nice, very similar to COD4 AK74U. I can see Laser getting a nerf.

* Other SMGs were cool, nothing really clicked though. MP7 isn't like MW3's. The recoil felt way too different. Vector was OK.

* Assault Rifles - I love the AN94, similar to an AK47. Type 25 is very accurate, M27 is good but weak.

* Select Fire attachment - Works good for burst to auto guns, really a waste on auto to burst guns since you can just tap trigger

* Awareness counters Dead Silence, which is good. The issue is that your audio is enhanced with non-DS users. This takes some getting used to.

* Scavenger replenishes all equipment and lethals. Scav packs only drop from non-explosive kills, though.

* Shotguns - S12 is like a SPAS, good. KSG hitmarkers like MW3, Remington is like a more reliable Stakeout, M1216 is a 4burst AA12

* I noticed significantly more hitmarkers while trying to Sandy people with the Remington. Use Laser to nosc, Long Barrel to get range

* If I had to recommend a class for TDM - MSMC ext mags, laser, Ghost/Hardline, Scavenger, Dead Silence, Semtex, Conc nade x2

* Scorestreaks for leveling up - UAV, cUAV, Hunter/Guardian/Lightning Strike for mad assist points, constant flow of score and obj play

* Scorestreaks for that perfect TDM lobby - UAV then Stealth Chopper into Warthog, Dogs, Swarm.

* Ballistic Knife - less drop it seems like, shot is instant (no delay like BO), low knife recovery, Replenish by walking over

* Spawns seem just like BO but less touchy. You can trap like the good old days in Domination. Takes 1 bozo to ruin it for the rest, though.

* Multi-Team can be played in TDM, Kill Confirmed and Hardpoint. I think 4 teams (?) max of 12 players.

* What else? The Crossbow shoots faster than in BO. 3 shot clip, it has an Acog, Red dot, thermal and TRIPLESHOT. Fire 3 shots at once.

* Biggest surprise is that @Optic_nadeshot thinks the LMGs are LEGIT. He thinks that the competitive guys will use them. I think he's nuts.

* Sprint duration relies on what weapon you hold, with combat knife letting you run the furthest",,False,self,t5_2sqqn,1348782370.0,,360,True,t3_10ki8w,http://www.reddit.com/r/blackops2/comments/10ki8w/a_summary_of_tweets_a_couple_of_major_youtubers/,

But many of you players just want snipers gone.  you may try to say you're ""anti-quickscope"" and ""anti-camper"".  can you just say your anti-sniper?  Quickscoping and shooting quickly after scoping are the only option in BO2 because the maps are so tiny.

After the patch, I hear people say things like ""the patch is good because now I'm not dying to snipers as much"".  Is that fair to snipers? Nobody in MLG touches snipers (except in strategic SnD matches) because *ARS, LMGs, and SMGs* beat snipers of equal skill 4/5 times.  

Still think that snipers in BO2 are OP? In MW3, the Barrett 50 cal had; semi auto fire, .2 sec ADS, ability to half scope, one shot kill on the whole body,and a massive 15 round clip.  The DSR has DOUBLE the ADS time, no half scoping allowed, a tiny 5 round clip,  a fire rate that is HALF the MSR's, and a whole body 1 shot kill. 

AND *almost nobody in MLG MW3 used the snipers, despite being ludicrously better then BO2 snipers.

Most guns can kill in less then .4 seconds.  Maybe its your fault you didn't kill that quickscoper.

That may be why Richtofen is now targeting them, maybe the electronic force could stop his control over the zombies, or the zombies in general.That may be why Maxis helps you through the steps in Transit.Also It seems like Marlton knew zombies would rise at some point, maybe that was what he was studying and got banished.

Also I think Richtofen created the Electrical Zombie and was an attempt at trying to get the electrical force.I﻿ think the tower of Babel is one of many towers which will stop the zombies when all activated at once, that's why they are in the Northern Hemisphere.They will probably have to activate towers around the world to create an electrical force﻿ which will stop all of the zombies.

Also I have proof Richtofen created the Electrical Zombie.In Nuketown you can here a distorted voice say ""POWER"" and Richtofen says he should have created a robot instead.Also I think the electrical force is a gigantic EMP.Because if you use an EMP grenade on a zombie you see the blue in their﻿ eyes go away.The blue eyes show Richtofen controls zombies, so maybe an EMP could destroy all of his control over the zombies.",,False,self,t5_2sqqn,1357184542.0,,,True,t3_15unf1,http://www.reddit.com/r/blackops2/comments/15unf1/black_ops_2_zombies_almost_solved/,

* I had $90,000 of debt, mostly from student loans, that I tried to pay for by any means I could.

* I was removed from Air Force pilot training based on my judgement and am also no longer in the military.

* I shutdown my channel 7 months ago because I was ordered to remove all affiliation with the ""iFlyILLINI"" moniker, not because of the hate and bullying I was subject to.

* I am no longer married.

So, what do you want to know?  Some of the comments in the post I linked above really concerned me because of how uneducated many were... Maybe I can change that.

To me hardcore is more fun and just a better game mode. If you're new to playing HC, are looking to try it, or just aren't very confident playing it, read on. This guide assumes familiarity with the game.

As for me, I currently hold a 1.87 and rising kill/death ratio in BO2 - playing exclusively Hardcore Team Deathmatch. My MW3 and Black Ops 2 numbers were similar - I finished BO with around a 1.78 and MW3 at 2.0+ playing 99.99% hardcore team deathmatch. I had someone ask me in a lobby the other day about my stats and success and I thought it might be fun to write this. If it helps someone, great.

**Please note, there are plenty of people better than me at this game.** In fact, I encourage others to speak up and offer their advice/criticisms as well. I mention these statistics to note my experience going into this guide, nothing more.

Please also note, I intended this to be a short set of tips but it ended up getting very involved. There is no tl;dr, but the general tips are the main thrust. Sorry!

-----------------------------

**Is hardcore right for me?** Possibly. If you have solid games in regular team deathmatch, you probably understand the principles that keep you alive and get you kills. If you grew up playing Counterstrike, you will feel right at home in HC - high bullet damage and an emphasis on quick reactions are something you will understand from the outset. If your reaction times are weak, HCTDM may not be the best for you (though it will make you a better player). But regardless, everyone should play at least 10 rounds of HCTDM once in their CoD career, just to see how you fair. Most people enjoy the increased power of guns and grenades. 

This guide will be written for the solo player with an emphasis on personal K/D. Because honestly, that's what most of us are here for.

---------------------------

**General Principles**

Your emphasis as a player in HC:TDM should be on **decreased vulnerability** and **quick lethality**.

You don't win by holding ground (most of the time). You don't win by getting huge scorestreaks. Your tricked out LSAT with diamond camo that makes you slow as an ox is now a liability to you and your team. You are no longer a quick-scoping God (not sure if those even exist in BO2). And rushing mindlessly around the map will also get you killed. 

Some weapons that you used in Core will no longer be ideal in HC. Some tactics that you used will be much less effective OR must be tailored to suit the altered damage and health in hardcore. Some perks and attachments become obsolete (like Scavenger), and some that you've never used before become immediately handy.

So, what do? These are the principles I play by:

- **Pace yourself**. You don't need to move terribly fast, just stay mobile. Trying to hold a chokepoint almost always backfires. This is about you and your k/d ratio, not about the orders that basement-dweller McGee is screaming at you with his 4 kills and 10 deaths, sitting in a corner with his riot shield blaming his team for sucking. You need to move, and to do this you need to know the maps. If you are new to the game, allow yourself to become familiar with the areas that people like to move and camp. Don't try to hold areas. Be mobile.
- **Simplicity**. Your basic goal is to put bullets in other players quicker than they put them into you. Try not to deviate from that. This means not tooling around with crossbows, RPGs, ballistic knives, axes, and other BS that will just get you shot and frustrated. Style points don't matter here, and your personal preferences aren't sacred if you really want to win.
- **Try to kill one person each life**. This seems obvious, but when you boil it down it's just a good principle to keep in the back of your head at all times. A lot of times people like to run to 'their' spot, or run a pre-planned route in their head. Think about where the enemy has been and where you've been killed recently. Try not to do the same thing all the time or even more than once. Kill one person, break even, and every other kill is gravy. 
- **But I can't kill even one person!** Then you're either playing a really good team or you need to adjust your tactics/loadout. Don't get frustrated, though, and try to think how you could have done something differently. Were you not mobile enough? Were you TOO mobile? Did your ACOG make you a half-step slower? Try to think about everything you do and why it does or does not work. You will eventually start to get kills.
- **Don't run beside teammates.** This isn't football. Not putting space between yourself and other people is asking to get double-killed and really hampers both you and them. If your teammate is running one way, run another way. If he gets shot, now you have intel on where the enemy is.
- **You don't have a constant map, so you'll need to behave differently.** UAV's are nice but you won't always have them. Focus on where you're going and where the enemy might be. Keep your targeting reticle where the enemy is most likely to appear - around a rock, in a corner, under a plane. While you're moving, always be thinking about the shifting battlefield and where the enemy might be coming from. Keep an eye on your teammates' names and take note when they get shot. This is how you get intel without a map.
- **Realistic scorestreak selection.** You will almost never get a swarm or K9 unit in hardcore TDM. Just embrace it. UAVs are immediately useful to your whole team. HK drones are quick and a kill about 75% of the time. RC-XD's and care packages leave you too vulnerable for too long. Use what works for you and will give you an immediate advantage. And shoot your teammate if he tries to demolish your sentry gun.
- **Unless you know your teammates and their abilities, don't trust them.** Never assume that your teammate will be able to guard a hallway just because he has his gun pointed down there. He will most likely die hilariously and get you shot in the back.
- **Assault shields. Not even once**. Most assault shield users actually have very average (~1.0) scores. You just remember them because of how frustrating it is to get killed by one. Unless you are in a party and are organized, stay away.
- **Cut the chatter. Seriously.** Too many people come into the game and just chat away about such and such who has to go to work in the morning and how much they love marijuana, subjecting me to the whines of their neglected wives/kids/pets in the background while complaining about dying constantly and loudly. Look, I understand the social aspect, and that's fine. But pointless chatter will get you distracted and make you a split second behind. Mute people who are distracting you and don't look back.
- **Distractions have a direct impact on your effectiveness.** Try to play when you don't have many distractions (TV shows, pets, etc.). This is true for Core as well but is especially detrimental in HC.
- **High sensitivity, but not too high.** You don't want the sensitivity so high that you're tracking past people's heads. But low sensitivity will gimp you. Find the sweet spot. If you're finding that you're dying because you can't reach people in time, you need to make an adjustment. 
- **Let the targets present themselves.** You don't always have to create an opportunity. People LOVE to move around in this game and move quickly. Unless you know there is a camper staring you in the face with their scope, don't be afraid to sit for a moment and let the target present itself. This is best done in cover, of course.
- **Semtex is fun again.**
- **Friendly fire. Don't do it, it's bad karma.** Try to apologize if you do it on accident.
- **Have one go-to custom class that you are entirely familiar with.** It's fun to try all of the different guns, but this generally leads to tears when you see your k/d afterward. If you find yourself getting trashed in a round, revert to the gun you are most familiar with - don't try to push a losing position. If you still can't break even with your default gun, it's time to find another lobby.
- **Limited HUD - not as scary as you think.** The biggest and pretty much only detriment to this is not being able to see how much ammo you have left. It's actually pretty freeing to have everything out of your peripheral vision. You shouldn't be trying to pick up other people's weapons unless you try to reload and you can't; if you have less than a mag of ammo left then it's time to find the closest dropped weapon. You won't live this long on most of your lives.
- **People on the other team are mad at you and accusing you of hacking? Good.** They're off balance. Now pedal to the metal and keep doing what you're doing. Never let up. Watch your stats increase.
- **Close range accuracy.** If the class you're setting up can't hit things quickly at close range, either with your primary or secondary weapon, it's all going to end in tears.
- **Make the easiest shot.** I.e., if you have a chance to shoot someone and you try to run up and knife them instead, you're putting yourself at risk. They might turn around and shoot you in the face or kill one of your teammates who's about to get an awesome scorestreak to help even the odds. Don't give your opponent a second chance.

1358176150.0,188,self.blackops2,16jxe9,Near unlimited UAV support,230,42,188,http://www.reddit.com/r/blackops2/comments/16jxe9/near_unlimited_uav_support/,"Yesterday I did something that seemed to work out pretty well.  It allowed me to have a near constant UAV up at all times.  I set my class up with hardline and only selected the UAV score streak.  Playing on Hardpoint, 2-3 kills and I would have a UAV.  Then 2-3 more and another and another and so on.  At one point I had put 3 UAVs in the air at the same time, because once you get the UAV, the score streak resets back for another UAV.  Its a great team support role and essentially allows for a constant UAV the entire game.  If the enemy team is shooting them down, they will literally need to have one guy dedicated to anti UAV actions.  

Edit: I just wanted to clarify a few things.  If you can get VSATs, yes they are obviously better.  If you can only average 1 UAV per life, then its kinda pointless.  But if you can average 2-3 UAVs per life at a time, there is a big advantage to have.  The point of this is to overwhelm the other team and provide your team with a constant advantage.  The reason being if even one of the other team members is spending time shooting down and hunting UAVs the whole game, that means that team is at an automatic disadvantage.  Yes 50 points for shooting it down is nice and all, but while you where chasing down that UAV, the other team took the hard point and is punishing your team with a 5v4 advantage.  If you leave multiple UAVs up, then the other team has a great view of the battle field.  So its a constant lose lose situation for the other team, that is pretty easy to create.",,False,self,t5_2sqqn,1358186167.0,,360,True,t3_16jxe9,http://www.reddit.com/r/blackops2/comments/16jxe9/near_unlimited_uav_support/,

Normally, the game starts out where you're your player with your guns, etc. How about a playlist where you start out as a dragonfire? Call it Dogfight. Your job, shoot down the enemy dragonfires. No perks, no UAV's, After 10 kills without dying, you get an EMP, which destroys all the enemy Dragonfires. When you're shot down, you respawn as another dragonfire. Maybe the same thing with AGR's.

First of all, thank you guys SO MUCH for displaying a lot of interest and support for the site. I had many people give me awesome ideas, help me fix bugs, and get some really good use out of it. At one point I had so many queries going on I had to add some hardcore caching since it was totaling my poor shared host.

It quickly got the attention of the guys at Beachhead Studio (the guys who make Elite), and after talking with them I have agreed to take down the site and stop development.

Many of you asked me how I pulled data from Elite and used it on my site. There are no public APIs, so I was forced to use a private API that piggybacks onto the mobile services of Elite. That API is only supposed to be used for mobile devices and the devs have told me there could be serious infrastructure issues with the mass use of it like cod.gs was doing.

This is not all bad news though. Beachhead has seen the massive interest the service has generated and is very interested in working with me on creating an ""official"" version of cod.gs! Things are not yet set in motion, but the potential is there as I've been told.

There's a gap waiting to be filled. I showed them that it could be filled. I still want it to be filled.

Feel free to follow me on twitter [@unpz](http://twitter.com/unpz) on any updates I have in this regard. You guys are so awesome for supporting it. Now it's time to take it to the next level.

For those unfamiliar what a code of ethics/honor and chivalry is, here are some definitions.

Code of ethics:Ethical codes are adopted by organizations to assist members in understanding the difference between 'right' and 'wrong' and in applying that understanding to their decisions.

Chivalry:the sum of the ideal qualifications of a knight(online soldier), including courtesy, generosity, valor, and dexterity in arms.

They really pushed Nuketown 2025. I realize some will argue that adding it would fragment the player base, but really that's what happens with all DLC in every COD game. Aside from the fact that it is a remake of the most popular map in COD history, it's also an extra map, period. I don't know about you guys, but I assumed it would be playable in the normal playlists just like all DLC maps. I think if they'd been more upfront about how it would really be, it might have caused some people to maybe not preorder. I realize we can play the Chaos playlist which sometimes features it, but I'm disappointed that this fun map isn't part of the regular playlist. Overall, it feels like they kind of screwed up with Nuketown 2025. They marketed it heavily, then yanked it completely from online play (seriously, what in THE FUCK were they thinking with that braindead decision?) They quickly added it back into the Chaos playlist, but only in response to overwhelming outcry. So, I don't really feel like an ""entitled whiner"", I honestly feel a little upset that this selling-point map isn't included in the normal rotation.

Feel my pain...,212,49,86,http://www.reddit.com/r/blackops2/comments/19wp88/psa_bought_the_wrong_season_pass_feel_my_pain/,"So I am an Aussie living in China. Have an Aussie PSN account, Aussie console, Hong Kong copy of Black Ops 2.  
 
So I wasn't thinking properly. I was told that the map pack is the same for all regions, but I wasn't aware that the season pass thing isn't (you need to download a -get this- a 100kb file to activate the map packs from store).  
 
So I bought the season pass for 65 dollars (Land of the fair go? Not a chance) and it doesn't work. Sent an email to sony:  

Hi,

Today I purchased the season pass for Black ops 2 from the PSN, and I
realize now I have erred.

I am from Australia and hence my system and PSN account are AUstralian, but
I am living in CHina and I am using a copy of Black Ops 2 bought from Hong
Kong.

Could I please have either a) access to the season pass for the Hong Kong
version of the game BLAS 50537 (I am not worried about the difference
between the cost of the 2 versions), or a refund so I can purchase the
correct version from the Hong Kong PS store?

My PSN account is linked to this email address and my login name is YCKanga.

I would appreciate a quick response!

Thanks,
  
........   
 
They sent a response early the next morning:  
 
Dear ...........

Thank you for your email.

We are sorry to hear that the DLC you have purchased is not compatible with your version of the game. As per our PlayStation Network Terms of Service we will not be able to provide a refund for this purchase, as we do not hold any liability and cannot guarantee compatibility with software purchases made outside of Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Oceania. 

For details regarding PlayStation Network Terms of Service please follow the below link:

http://legaldoc.dl.playstation.net/ps3-eula/psn/e/e_tosua_en.html

Should you have any further enquiries, please do not hesitate to contact us again. 

Regards,

PlayStation Support Centre    
  
So I replied:  
 
I am a little disapppointed with this decision. I can understand that you don't see a legal obligation but I think that it is a wiser business decision to try and help the customer be satisfied with his purchase.  
 
I am a long time PS player, having owned a PS1, PS2, PS3 and PSP. I also usually buy other sony appliances, including a TV and a Camera. 

I am a more traditional gamer and I am not used to buying DLC or any soft copy of software. I feel like I am being punished for living outside of my country of origin. 

I think that the region system is stupid and I reckon that the only difference between the different DLC packs is a few lines of code.  
 
If you really don't want to help me, then I guess I will have to live with that, but it is deeply regrettable and I will have to think twice about my involvement with the PSN and forget about buying games or content online. 

Thanks for your time,

So, I guess I am out 65 bucks. I don't know why I am posting this here, but it could be a useful PSA to expatriates like myself. Make sure you buy the right region, because Sony will stiff you, even if you are a loyal customer. 
 
 Next day edit: Just got an email from Sony support. My heart rate increased as I opened the message, a glimmer of hope emerging in my mind's eye.

I think it's your spirit. Remember when CoD was fun for us? That sense of discovery? Remember your first Killstreak? That's what's missing. That's what we need. That's what **YOU** need.

Every where you look, you will find tryhards. IRL, Halo, Crysis. There is no escaping the community who needs to pull a positive KD to have fun. What's happening is you are in a rut. This obsessive drive for a ""good"" game is going to end your CoD career. Don't look for a good game. Ease into one. Play outside your comfort zone. Suck at Hardcore? Go in and **tear that shit up**.

I believe you have the capability to do good in this game. It's only broken when you are looking for reasons to blame anyone for your mistakes. If I get killed by a Sentry, I don't scream at the kids on the other team. I decide to pick up a different class, one with Blind Eye and Engineer, take it out, and then go back to the game.


This is where your mistake is. You're looking at the score, not the game. Remember that nice kill feed you got halfway through that TDM game that really helped your team out? Or maybe you just capped a flag in DOM and that put your team in the lead. Hell, you might even be playing a FFA or Party game. You don't have to take the lead to have fun, you have to play the game to have fun.

Play, don't blame.

Learn, don't scream.

Grow, don't cry.

You'll get better, **but not with the attitude of a twelve year old.**

Fix yourself, not the game. It was your fault, not the game, but in the long run, does it matter? Does it really matter that your bad at a videogame?
You might have a nice car, a special someone, maybe a kid out there who looks up to you. Be a bigger person for whatever it is you care about; because this is a game. It is NOT a measurement of skill. 

It is a hobby, a pass time, a life style; but it is not a measurement of success.

So take the blows as they come, stand taller, sit up straight, chin up, calm down, deep breaths, take out your FJH, and take em out. One by one.

This isn't accurate. Instead, it increases the points you earn by 20%.

As an example, suppose you're going for a Counter UAV. You need 600 Points.

With Hardline, five ordinary kills in Domination will get you the Counter UAV exactly. Each kill nets you 120 points instead of 100. If you run a test, you'll notice that after your fifth kill you will have a Counter UAV and no points built up towards your next streak.

If Hardline worked the way people have suggested, then a Counter UAV would only require 480 points. If that were the case, after your fifth kill you'd have the Counter UAV and 20 points towards your next streak. But this isn't how it works. If you run a private match you'll see that after your fifth kill the little white bar is at zero. 

So, the benefit you get from Hardline is going to depend on how you're getting your points. A few examples from Domination:

**Capping B Flag or Opposing Flag**
W/out Hardline: 200 Points
W/ Hardline: 240 Points
Benefit: 40 Points

**Capture Kill**
W/out Hardline: 200 Points
W/ Hardline: 240 Points
Benefit: 40 Points

**Cap Home Flag**
W/out Hardline: 50 Points
W/ Hardline: 60 Points
Benefit: 10 Points

**Ordinary Kill**
W/out Hardline: 100 Points
W/ Hardline: 120 Points
Benefit: 20 Points

**Destroy UAV**
W/out Hardline: 75 Points
W/ Hardline: 90 Points
Benefit: 15 Points

So, if you're just slaying and not playing the objective, Hardline will reduce the number of kills you need to get a Lightning Strike from 8 to 7. But if you're getting your points from capping contested flags, kills while capping flags, shooting down stealth choppers, then you're going to see the biggest benefit from hardline.

TL;DR -- Hardline increases the points you earn by 20% (it doesn't reduce the number of points needed by 20%), so those who take actions that are worth the most points (capping B flag, kills while capping) will reap the greatest benefit.",,False,self,t5_2sqqn,False,,360,True,t3_150j9k,http://www.reddit.com/r/blackops2/comments/150j9k/how_hardline_works/,

Now let us begin..

Have you ever walked underneath a streetlight and it turns off? And it somehow feels like they alwayss turn off when you walk underneath them? Like maybe you have some sort of special powers or something? Most people have, and I've heard people adamantly argue that it happens to them all the time, everywhere they go. This is actually a psychological principle called ""confirmation bias"".

Without going too much into it, lets think rationally about how many streetlights you have walked underneath that HAVENT turned off. Easily thousands. However, every single one that didnt turn off was ignored, because this is simply how life is supposed to be. Whenever they do turn off though, its a remarkable event, and we take note of it, and it sticks out like a post-it note in a textbook. Its such a memorable event, that when we look back, its very easy to ignore all the times the lights stayed on, and only see the times that the lights turned off. 

So how does this apply to COD? 

We all think we are above average players (and if you have an above 1 kd, mathematically, you are!). And we have all learned to expect certain things from the game. First off, we expect to get the kill more often than not, but more importantly, we expect to get the kill ESPECIALLY when we get first bullets. So this means 2 things: 1- deaths stand out more than kills and 2- deaths where we get first bullets stand out the most. So, if we look at quickscoping, or getting killed by shotguns, it's easy to see that whenever we get first bullets and die to a OHK, its extremely noticeable because its unexpected.. We forget to remember the hundreds of times that we got that kill because the shotgun (despite possibly having seen us first and trying to get within range) wasnt close enough to kill us, or the sniper didnt have time to raise his gun.

The fact is that the time to kill with a SMG is shorter than the time it takes to get the ballista up and kill someone.. So whenever you die to a quickscope, it was either luck, or they were ready for that battle before you were. Quickscopers have statistically lower stats than the rest of us. The snipers are not OP.

The fact of the matter is that it is your own bias; thinking that you deserve the kill that is making you feel this way. You end up getting that kill 9 times out of 10, however you forget those other 9 because that 1 time you dont is so damn frustrating. 

TL/DR: You remember the times you got quickscoped, you forget the millions of times you got the kill, simply because that is the expected result.",,False,self,t5_2sqqn,False,,,True,t3_1j1c8x,http://www.reddit.com/r/blackops2/comments/1j1c8x/psychology_and_why_you_actually_hate_quickscoping/,

* I tried to get as big of a sample size as I could before I got tired of researching

* Grabbed from a random sample of 49 players with the following requirements


1. Played 100+ games of Hardpoint (since hardpoint seems to be the more popular game mode)
2. Had a K/D between 1.0 - 3.0 (to show statistics better reflecting an average player, most were around 1.5 K/D)
3. Hardpoint was their most played game (again since hardpoint seems to be more popular, and to keep away from groundwar)
4. Double checked to make sure they didn't have statistics that a booster would

** denotes using hardline (yes I know hardline gives you more points, not reduces points required, but it's close enough)

Efficiency is calculated by (Kills/Usage/Score)*100000, this calculates how efficient the killstreak is at killing relative to the score required to obtain it

**Observations:**

* Surprisingly (at least to me) RC-XD is quite a bit more efficient than Hunter Killer, but you have to remember, you have to sit there and control the RC-XD, u don't with the Hunter Killer

* Don't grab VTOL, it just doesn't seem to get enough kills for its cost

* Warthog seems to be another one that you'd probably be better off grabbing something else

* This one might be obvious, but Lightning Strike is quite a bit better than Hellstorm Missile (yet their cost difference is only 50 pts)

* If you want to with more mid-ranged killstreaks; Dragonfire, Stealth Chopper, and Escort Drone or AGR are probably your best bet

* Dragonfire seems to be amazingly efficient considering it only costs 975 (780 with hardline)

Of course there's a lot more to take into account than just how efficient they are at killing for the cost, things like Swarm tends to kill you making it annoying to rack up your score again, a lot of scorestreaks can be map dependent and just aren't as effective as others, a combination of two scorestreaks might actually be even more effective such as K9's with Lodestar

1355689824.0,155,self.blackops2,14yegq,all of my black ops 2 tips...so far,201,46,91,http://www.reddit.com/r/blackops2/comments/14yegq/all_of_my_black_ops_2_tipsso_far/,"ok, so on my youtube i explain these tips more in depth so go check them out =P  (i update this list every sunday with each week's new tips.
http://www.youtube.com/user/PatTheGam3r

here're the tips:

Black Ops 2 Tip #51 - An EMP grenade can be a lifesaver when you're about to die by a hunter killer drone. Either as soon as you hear the beep noise when the killer locks onto you or if you can see it (and it's not too far in the air) just throw the emp grenade in the general direction and you can destroy it.

Black Ops 2 Tip #50 - If you like to use ghost and like to take down UAVs with a blackhat, walk as you destroy the UAV... don't just stand there in one spot. You're basically a sitting duck while hacking it so this helps keep you off the radar.

Black Ops 2 Tip #49 - Black ops 2 is different from the other call of duty's in the fact that the hip fire is incredibly more accurate. When you get into those close gunfights you are more likely to get the kill if your not aiming.

Black Ops 2 Tip #48 - Don't shoot just because you see an enemy. Pick the gunfight. Don't alert an enemy traveling in another direction to your position by shooting at him just because you see him. Don't shoot at an enemy you won't be able to kill.

Black Ops 2 Tip #47 - You can use the hellstorm missle the same way you did a predator missle in MW3..... You can use it to take out enemy scorestreaks! (VTOL, AGR, Stealth Chopper, Escort Drone, etc..)

Black Ops 2 Tip #46 - Your run speed is affected by what type of gun you are carrying. LMGs will run slower than a pistol, unlike MW3.

Black Ops 2 Tip #45 - You can switch your classes in between rounds (of games like domination and demolition) without losing your current scorestreak!. (switch classes during the countdown at the beginning of the next round)

*Black Ops 2 Tip #44 - When you are reloading your shotgun (and the executioner pistol) it reloads one bullet at a time. You don't have to wait for the entire mag to finish reloading to start firing again!

*Black Ops 2 Tip #43 - Keep an eye on the minimap. You can tell where an enemy is if you can catch their hunter killer drone or dragonfire on the map as soon as they deploy it. Maybe get an easy kill.

*Black Ops 2 Tip #42 - Always remember that on just about every high traffic area, on every map, there are usually 2 or 3 ways to get there. Don't get stuck dieing at the same point every time by a camper....go around!

*Black Ops 2 Tip #41 - When you're getting into a gun fight, try to start firing your weapon before you start aiming down it's sights. You're unable to shoot while you're aiming unless you were already shooting.

*Black Ops 2 Tip #40 - If you are going to use an AGR, throw the marker towards the enemy spawn; not your own. It breaks from its package and kills them without you having to control it!

*Black Ops 2 Tip #39 - The EMP scorestreak will stop enemies from using scorestreaks, remove their HUD, and even stop them from using their blackhats!

*Black Ops 2 Tip #38 - This one's for you christmas noobs... If your team has a care package and you notice the ""contents"" of the package change...don't take it. When an enemy booby-traps a carepackage it will change what the other team see's as it's contents.



Black Ops 2 Tip #37 - When you're about to run around a corner, start or be ready to start aiming twoards the higher traffic area. Basically, being cautious. This will allow you to not get caught by surprise be an enemy espicially if you don't know they are there.




Black Ops 2 Tip #36 - If you are up for the challenge...you can actually shoot down a hellstorm missile as it's coming down! Save yourself!




Black Ops 2 Tip #35 - Weather you knew this before or not... In Black Ops 2 your main source of xp are the medals that you earn throughout the game. You can easily level up quick by getting tons of medals (because a lot of them are extremely EASY to get). Just look at your game summary at the end of your next game and see which medals you get a lot and just keep getting them in all of your next games for quick level ups!




Black Ops 2 Tip #34 - Remember that if you are using the engineer perk you can walk past enemy equipment (bouncing betties/claymores) without setting them off instantly (like stalker pro in mw3). You don't have to destroy/hack their equipment which alerts the enemy to your presence!




Black Ops 2 Tip #33 - Remember that this game is supposed to be fun. If your starting to get angry at the game then stop playing it or go to a different lobby. The easiest way to avoid getting angry is to play with friends!




Black Ops 2 Tip #32 - Small thing you might already know...You can change your weapon sight's reticle (but not the colors of them =( ). And when you unlock a new reticle pattern, it can be used for every gun, not just the one you unlocked it with.




Black Ops 2 Tip #31 - Honestly, read the small advice thing that comes up on the loading screen before every match... You can sometimes learn something new! =]

*Black Ops 2 Tip #30 - Get into the habit (if you aren't already) of going directly into prone after missing a knife attack. Hopefully you can save yourself before dieing from the bullshit miss. =P

*Black Ops 2 Tip #29 - Pretty simple but, make sure you look at the minimap before you throw your carepackage marker. The spawns flip way too easy in this game, so make sure your team is on you, not the enemy.

*Black Ops 2 Tip #28 - If you use the engineer perk you can disarm a booby-trapped carepackage for some points! Not to mention it saves at least 1 of your teammates lives.

*Black Ops 2 Tip #27 - When you pick up the trophy system after it has already destroyed one piece of explosive, it can be placed down again as if you never deployed it.

*Black Ops 2 Tip #26 - Collecting your own tags in kill confirmed doesn't give you 250 points towards your scorestreak but you still get a medal that gives you 250 xp!

*Black Ops 2 Tip #25 - You can move the vtol warship from place to place by hitting the r2 trigger! Don't stay in one spot!

*Black Ops 2 Tip #24 - Remember that the hellstorm has a boost that you can use before you have it fire it's ""hellstorm!""



*Black Ops 2 Tip #23 - An orbital vsat will show where an enemy stealth chopper is on the minimap.

*Black Ops 2 Tip #22 - The FMJ attachmet just about doubles weapon damage against enemy scorestreaks. It is BEAST at taking out sentry guns and guardians quick!

*Black Ops 2 Tip #21 - Think hardline is a useless perk? Well it's much better than ever! It reduces the amount of point you need for a scorestreak by 20%!

*Black Ops 2 Tip #20 - If you time it right you can dolphin dive or even just jump over a claymore and not die. You will get damaged quite a bit so make sure you hide afterwards and let your health regenerate!

*Black Ops 2 Tip #19 - Just like MW3 you can go prone to avoid bouncing betties. You can also just duck and not take any damage at all, unlike MW3.

*Black Ops 2 Tip #18 - Did you know EMP grenades can effect people and equipment through walls.




*Black Ops 2 Tip #17 - Flack Jacket is incredibly powerful. It can easily save you from grenades and can even save you from a lodestar's missile!

*Black Ops 2 Tip #16 - Have one class specifically to destroy killstreaks. Launcher, Blind Eye, Cold blooded, Engineer, emp grenade, and Black hat is one of the best set ups for it.

*Black Ops 2 Tip #15 - Did you know that if you have a combat knife as a secondary (no weapon picked) you can pick up any gun while wielding your primary and the gun only replaces the combat knife, not your primary.

*Black Ops 2 Tip #14 - If someone is killing you with a killstreak such as a loadstar or vtol warship, watch the killcam and look for the green diamond. That is where thay are and you can easily take them out ending their streak!

*Black Ops 2 Tip #13 - When you dive into prone you will get an extra 100 points (to your level xp, not pointstreak). You can also have killed someone well after you even dived to prone to get the points.

*Black Ops 2 Tip #12 - Did you know that you can spring for longer durations if you are wielding a combat knife!

*Black Ops 2 Tip #11 - Hardly ever use your secondary? Put a launcher as your secondary and shoot everything down! It is such easy points and helps your team!


*Black Ops 2 Tip #10 - Stuck because you don't know which weapon to choose? Watch killcams and see which weapon most enemies are killing you with and test that one out. If they use it, it must be for a reason.

*Black Ops 2 Tip #9 - Your weapons can prestige! Remember to prestige them so you can unlock everything again and get xp for it again and rank up faster!

*Black Ops 2 Tip #8 - Enemy camping in a room but you're not exactly sure where? Throw a sensor grenade in there and light him up on the minimap for everyone to see.

*Black Ops 2 Tip #7 - See a carepackage stuck on a roof or out of the map? AS long as you can see a small part of it you can get it using the blackhat!

*Black Ops 2 Tip #6 - Did you know when using a tactical insertion you can choose if you want to spawn where you placed it! In other words, you don't have to spawn back where an enemy is camping your tact insert. Save Yourselves!


*Black Ops 2 Tip #5 - Scavenger will resupply everything!   (claymores, bettys, grenades...) as long as the person wasn'tkilled by anything explosive.

*Black Ops 2 Tip #4 - Remember that your killstreaks will stack to help you get your others. Even if you die or get it from a care package!

*Black Ops 2 Tip #3 - When you get into ""find match"" look at the bottom right corner and press the button for search preferences than select best. This should hopefully fix some lag issues you are having, if any.

*Black Ops 2 Tip #2 - Tired of showing up on a UAV and desperately want ghost? Use the Operative default class, it comes with ghost! Sacrifice a little for a lot.

*Black Ops 2 Tip #1 - Always run UAV. Ghost isn't unlocked until level 55 (the highest level you can achieve until you can prestige) so almost every one will appear on the minimap.",,False,self,t5_2sqqn,1357522514.0,,,True,t3_14yegq,http://www.reddit.com/r/blackops2/comments/14yegq/all_of_my_black_ops_2_tipsso_far/,

1359086233.0,153,self.blackops2,178imh,Target Finder,222,69,88,http://www.reddit.com/r/blackops2/comments/178imh/target_finder/,"I've been thinking a long time about the Target Finder, ruminating my thoughts as I continued to play Treyarch's new entry to the Call of Duty franchise. And I think that I have come to a conclusion.

First off, I understand both camps of the argument over whether or not the Target Finder is over-powered. As a rusher myself, I understand how it can be frustrating to be killed at a medium range very quickly by someone using the FAL OSW with Target Finder and Select Fire. I also understand other people who say the Target Finder is no better than Marksman in MW3. It has its counter, Cold-Blooded, just as Marksman had its counter in Assassin Pro in MW3. But this post isn't going to be about me complaining about or defending the Target Finder Scope. I am going to suggest a change to the scope that I think would lead to an overall improved Call of Duty experience and list the reasons I believe this change should be implemented.

First, I would like to get it out in the clear that I don't like the Target Finder. It violates my sense of basic Call of Duty tactics that I have developed over the many years of playing this franchise. But that is irrelevant. Whether or not I like it, it's in the game. It was Treyarch's choice and they can make the game how they like. It doesn't matter how I feel about it from an emotional standpoint, so I will speak no more on that matter.

What I would like to say is that I feel that the Target Finder is over-powered. And I greatly hesitate to use that word; I know I have lost a great portion of my audience just by typing that sentence. I have used over-powered to describe things such as the M16A4, the MP40, OMA Tubes, the Famas, and Assassin. The Target Finder is nowhere near those weapons and abilities' level and I think that Treyarch has seriously created the most balanced Call of Duty experiences to date, trumping Call of Duty 4. So I will just say the Target Finder is a strong attachment. In my opinion, a little too strong. So that's that.

Next, I would like to address the Marksman argument. I do not think the Target Finder is ""just Marksman."" And I will tell you why. First off, Marksman was a perk, not an attachment. Marksman was in the same tier with other powerhouse perks such as the infamous Sitrep Pro, Dead Silence, Stalker, and Steady Aim. The Target Finder can be combined with up to two other attachments on almost any primary weapon, and its not like there is a lot of competition for better attachments. Seriously, just think about the other optics, particularly the ACOG scope. They're exactly the same thing, except the Target Finder has added functionality as well as a better targeting reticle than most of the ACOG's slew of awful reticles. Second, the Target Finder not only highlights enemies in your ADS view, it also beeps and flashes when they are directly in your sights. This functionality is also completely uncounterable by any perk. This on-target functionality makes the Target Finder Scope not ""just Marksman,"" it makes it something more. My final point against the Marksman argument is that I would argue that Marksman does not help you aquire your target as well as the Target Finder does. This is certainly a subjective point, but I think it is valid nonetheless. Marksman added the red name above the player at long distances. This helped you recognize the general direction of a target, but it did not help you actually acquire and aim at the target. The Target Finder scope does exactly this. It puts a box around the target rather than just a name above their head, giving you a more precise and obvious target to aim at, as well as, we mustn't forget, alerting you when your aim is true. The red diamond, in my opinion, offers greater help in target acquisition than the red name that Marksman offered.

And now, I will detail my solution to this perceived issue. It is quite simple, in fact. I would suggest removing the mini-map while aiming down the sight of the Target Finder scope. This mechanic occurs while aiming down the sight of the Dual-Band and Variable Zoom scopes on the LMGs and I believe that it should be encorporated into the Target Finder. I believe this is the best possible solution due to its non-invasiveness. The description for the scope in the Create-a-Class menu does not need to be changed, the other functionalities will not be effected, the rest of the HUD will not be effected, the only thing that will happen is that the mini-map will be removed. It is also no doubt a very simple thing to change in the game's code. I am sure that there is only a single line of code in the Dual-Band and Variable Zoom scopes that calls up an operation within the game's code that removes the mini-map while ADS. It is very specific and a relatively rare thing that happens, considering that only two weapon classes will ever use that line of code, so it must be a defined, simple, and explicit thing in the coding of the game. Maybe I'm wrong, I've only taken introductory classes in Java and Visual Basic, but if Treyarch can add an entire gun into the game I'm sure they can modify a very small, specific mechanic on one attachment in the game.

Removing the mini-map while ADS with the Target Finder will hamper the user's middle to close range performance while ADS due to a more limited situational awareness. This will lead to the Target Finder becoming more of the long-range marksman attachment that it was intended to be rather than the all-around best optic for any playstyle. This would also balance it with the ACOG Scope, due to the ACOG retaining its mini-map privileges.

1370016079.0,149,self.blackops2,1fervs,"Short comparison of the Black Ops 1 and 2 maps, and major differences.",180,31,121,http://www.reddit.com/r/blackops2/comments/1fervs/short_comparison_of_the_black_ops_1_and_2_maps/,"The most depressing thing I’ve done all week is compare the top-downs of the Black Ops 1 maps to those from this game. But I also found it very revealing in terms of why this game plays the way it does, and so I thought I’d share what I observed. If anyone else would like to compare the top-downs before continuing, here they are:

[Black Ops 1 maps](http://www.codblackopsblog.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-multiplayer-maps-list/)

[Black Ops 2 maps](http://www.blackopsii.com/bo2/multiplayer-maps/)

Obviously simply looking at the top-downs isn’t going to give you a complete picture of what’s going on in the games in terms of map design and, especially, overall gameplay, because there are so many other factors to take into account: weaponry, perk design, netcode, etc. But I drew a number of conclusions from studying the designs and from my own experience playing the maps, and was wondering what the rest of you thought. Here’s what I found.

Compared to BO1, the maps in BO2:

* 1. Are smaller in general
* 2. Have shorter lines of sight
* 3. Have smaller interior spaces, with little delineation between indoor and outdoor battle-space
* 4. Generally follow a “3-corridor” design, or “line” design.
* 5. Have very little “multi-level” gameplay

Point one I think it pretty apparent. The maps in general aren’t *that* much smaller, but they *are* smaller, and even some of the larger maps (Plaza, Drone, Cargo) are filled with very simple “blocks” of space that basically facilitate the kind of gameplay you get from smaller maps.  Point two is essentially a result of point one.

But I think points three and four are the most important in terms of understanding why this game is so much more fast-paced than its predecessor. If you compare the top-downs, the Black Ops 1 maps almost all had very large interior spaces that were clearly delineated from its outdoor spaces, which essentially broke the maps up into numerous different zones, all of which could support different playstyles (think of Grid, Havana, Array, WMD, Radiation). You see very little of this in BO2, in which most of the interior spaces are very small, simple rooms with 1-2 entrances (think of the buildings in maps like Standoff, Slums, Raid, etc) that serve little purpose other than to promote camping and head-glitching over windows.

Point four is especially depressing to me. Looking at the BO2 maps, almost all are composed of three main “lanes” around which the action is centered, with very few and very simplistic routes in-between. BO1 also had some 3-lane maps (WMD comes to mind, as does Summit), but the three lanes in those maps were intersected by many different side-paths and entrances, and were suitably full of cover and obstacles. 

Point five is sort of a bonus, as I know a lot of people like multi-level maps and a lot of people don’t. I’m not talking about window rooms, like on Raid and Standoff—I mean maps that have large areas that contain numerous floors or platforms of varying heights, such as Grid, Jungle, Launch, Havana. These are less prevalent in BO2 than in BO1.

I think that BO2 is an extremely fun game and has without a doubt the most balanced weapon design of any of the modern CoDs, but I think the maps are generally pretty uninspired compared to BO1, and I’d love to see Treyarch take note of the differences in their next installment.

Please feel free to offer rebuttals/contrary opinions.

(Public Service Announcement),191,42,123,http://www.reddit.com/r/blackops2/comments/15z53p/warning_do_not_play_local_public_service/,"There is a chance that if you play a local game you may be affected by a bug which corrupts your online data on Treyarch's servers. It may be possible this is a xbox/playstation only issue as I havnen't seen reports of PC gamers being hit by it.

This issue has been impacting players for over a month now, but because Activision/Treyarch has not made an announcement, people are still being affected. This makes the game unplayable (excluding League) and hundreds, if not thousands, of players have had cases open with Activision/Treyarch since early December with no resolution. 

----

If you are impacted by this, you will:

* Lose all of your Create-a-Class slots

* Lose all of your permanent prestige unlocks

* Most perks/weapons/etc will be locked with no unlock tokens available

* Your statistical data will be corrupted in-game and through elite (example: http://i.imgur.com/JFRV8.jpg ). 

* The permanent unlock and token information in the bottom right corner of the Create-A-Class screen will be overlapping so you cannot read them

Back-story: I played local on my account at a friend's over the holidays and when I returned home I was hit by this bug. It has made the game unplayable on anything other than league. Activision/Treyarch will not give an ETA when or even if this will be fixed. I spoke to them over the phone, on the support boards, and through email.

---
Don't let this happen to you. **DO NOT PLAY LOCAL.**

---

I will give them another week to fix this and then I will perform a fresh start and hope it fixes the issues. Honestly this is the worst support I've ever experienced for a game breaking issue. If all of my close friends weren't playing this game I would just abandon it totally. If you add up all the costs to play the game (xbox live, cod bo2 game, season pass) you get a hell of a lot of money.

The support forums are packed with posts about this. Examples:

Some people are wondering ""why bother?"" or think this is a waste of time due to previous CoD code stating 100ms increments.  I believe I have worse latency than 100ms with a 4-Bar.  Scientifically speaking, I have a hypothesis and now I need to test.  If you want to be a part of this test I would love to include you.  If not, no hard feelings.

For some reference, this article on Wikipedia is actually accurate:  http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lag_(online_gaming)#section_3

Cod uses the interpolation method for player position, and rewind time for hit detection. 

Once you understand how those concepts work, everything will start to fall into place, and you'll realize how difficult of a problem this really is. 

Edit: I tried my best to explain the effects of lag comp in a way any cod player can understand it here:

1370640727.0,134,self.blackops2,1fw152,Tips for the Average COD Player: Diamond Shotguns,177,43,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/blackops2/comments/1fw152/tips_for_the_average_cod_player_diamond_shotguns/,"In this issue of Tips for the Average COD Player, I will be talking about the gun class that everybody loves to hate, shotguns! Bedazzled shotguns look amazing and will make a few people jealous who cannot get through the grind or give up half way through. Here I will be discussing my strategy and personal experiences when I went through it, to hopefully give you as the reader something to consider. Again I consider myself an average player, so my aim here is to help others in the same situation.  If at any time you see something I missed or need clarification on something, please let me know! Lastly I do not care about upvotes (this is a text only post obviously) but the more people who read this and see it as helpful, please pass it along. Alright, let’s get started!

* **Basics**

* In order to unlock any of the of the cammo challenges towards getting the gun gold, each shotguns require 250 one shot kills to advance to the second set of challenges. The class builds around these weapons will be relatively the same across the board, mobility and hip fire (with the exception of the KSG, but we will get to that later). You want to be quick and agile, but at the same time stay off the enemy HUD on larger maps when the occasion calls. There is no need to build a class around long distance, you are after all playing very, VERY close to the enemy. 

* **The Remington**

Quite possibly one of the most used shotguns I personally see across the board in Black Ops 2, it is also one of the easiest finish up quickly. I have a love hate relationship with this gun: when the connection is on my side and the right lobby, this gun is an absolute BEAST, if things go the opposite way, I may as well be shooting nerf darts at the enemy. This gun is pump action as I am sure you are all well aware, and has a pretty decent spread. This gun can be fired from the hip quite accurately even without the laser sight. I set mine up one of two ways depending on how I wanted to run: long barrel/laser sight or quickdraw/extended mag. As great as this gun is to hip-fire, you should bring up the sights when you can for a tighter grouping on your spread. Extended mags work great because you are not going to be able to land a one hit kill every time without reloading (most of the time). SIDE NOTE: This is the gun that got me all of my chain kill emblems, rocking extended mags saved my ass on all occasions.

* One shot kills do not seem to be much of an issue on this gun in particular, it has high power and a good reach to it, slapping long barrel onto this adds even more. You should find racking up the 250 one shot kills easy enough to do, but like all weapons, this part usually takes the longest. 

* Bloodthirsty medals are relatively easy to if you can roll into an objective based game mode (Domination, Hardpoint) on a map that gives you the distinct advantage in CQC.  As stated above, if you build your class around speed and check your corners, you will be that guy that everybody hates on the enemy team.  Toughness is a good idea on this class if you bring up your sights for an other than one shot kill situation. 

* **The S12**

Arguably one of the most underrated shotguns in its class, the S12 dominates more so than the Remington in CQC purely based on the rate of fire. This gun is relatively diverse in short encounters IF you know what your limits are. Although it lacks the distance of the Remington right off the bat, you can spam your shots at your opponent effectively if you bring up your sights to aim. This is a great hip-fire weapon with a laser sight, even better while aiming them down.  This weapon can chew through ammo quickly though, equip fast mags for quicker reloading (standard reload is SLOW). I ran my class, again, one of two ways: laser sight/fast mags, laser sight/fast mags/quickdraw (primary gun fighter wildcard). Again speed and dexterity are your friends here, you want to get to those CQC havens quickly to dominate your enemy. 

* For the one shot kills, I was torn on this particular challenge. I first went right into HC, knowing that this gun’s one hit kill radius would be increased. However, I slowly began to realize that people camp a bit more in HC than in Core. About halfway through, I decided to take this gun into core so I could survive more than one bullet from the tool sitting in the corner with an LMG/Target finder combo. I discovered that this gun could get a one shot kill pretty easily, If I played to its strengths. I built my class around stealth and dexterity. I would kill anybody I saw, but would not start spraying at a guy who had not seen me yet. I managed to rack up the last half of the one shot kills in a few hours. This took a bit more time than the Remington, but not a whole lot. 

* For people complaining about any of the other challenges related to this class, you have to play with confidence and relatively aggressive. Get used to the rate of fire and the limits in terms of range. It is easy to turn on people who just ran past you or are shooting at you and spray away. You are no longer going for the one shot kills, so spam those shots! Scavenger seems to be needed in the last half of the challenges as you will be flying through more ammo than you think. Patrol a section of the map, control the CQC areas in which you have the advantage. Once you manage to finish this gun and get it to gold, you will ultimately end up loving it (at least I did) as it is a fun weapon when you know what your working with. 

* **The KSG**

This gun seems to frustrate people quite a bit, because unlike the other three weapons within the class, this one fires a slug instead of buckshot. I have a permanent KSG class set up named “Big Game Hunter” because this gun is insane once you get the hang of it. Try to think of this as a sniper rifle if you will, whose range is slightly reduced. You need to make sure you are aiming at the enemy when you take your shot, otherwise you will miss; this seems to baffle many people. The range on this gun (for a shotgun) is absolutely insane. For example, on Nuketown, it takes two shots window to window to kill somebody. With this range you will hear people questioning how the hell they got picked off with a shotgun halfway across the map.  This shotgun is based around precise aim; too high, low or to the side and you will miss, you may even have to lead your target a bit to hit them. This would be the only shotgun I would recommend going into a bot game and getting practice with it. Once you learn how to semi-quickscope with this gun, you will have fun with it, I promise.

* The one shot kills with this weapon are easy enough to get once you get down the aim. Set your class up with a red-dot and ditch the laser attachment (sounds odd for a shotgun I know) to get an accurate line of site. I rolled my class with three attachments that worked wonders: quickdraw/stock/red-dot. PRO TIP: I REALLY like the way the predator reticle works with this gun, if you have it unlocked give it a try, you will be glad you did! Although you have to be accurate, you can keep your safe distance with this gun and fire away at your enemies. The beauty of this gun is that it has a pretty large clip to begin with so extended mags can be left out while going for one shot kills. Try to remember that this gun requires a bit of patience and practice with to hit people, but becomes easier over time.

* For the other challenges, treat this as you would the one shot kills, and yes this does include the bloodthirsty challenges. The KSG as we have gone over has incredible range, but when you are not going for one shot kills, you can start to play a little bit more aggressive. I ended up rolling with a silenced KSG, utilizing a red dot and quickdraw. Eeven with the silencer this thing is still a powerhouse and you have the comedic relief of what it sounds like when it fires silenced (If I had to guess it sounds like a squirrel farting). If you are having trouble getting purely KSG kills for the bloodthirsty, try rolling with a pistol (Tac 45 anybody?) to get people you feel you would otherwise miss with your primary. This gun is incredibly fun to troll people with, as a good portion of users do not get the learning curve down right and give up on learning. You can and WILL run a train on people after some practice and confidence in this weapon, I promise.

* **The M1216**

Last up we have the AA12 inspired M1216 (For writing reasons, we refer to this as the M12, which is what I call it anyway).The M12 fires four shots automatically and re-chambers after the fourth round has been fired (take note of this) which can land you in some trouble if your shots didn’t bring down an enemy beforehand.  This gun is arguably the most frustrating in terms of the first 250 one shot kills. The gun always wants to dump more than one shot at people and in core; unless you are right up on the person, is usually what it takes to kill them anyway. You will need to go into HC ANYTHING to get the one shots for this weapon, as much as you may not want to (I am not saying it impossible not to, you will just save time).

*  First off, you need to practice with your trigger finger: versus being able to rapidly press the trigger in succession, you need to train yourself into being able to tap it quickly…really quickly. There may be times where you think you got “X” amount of one shot kills in a game, but in reality the frame rate may have skipped for a second and you actually fired more than one. PRO TIP: If I was ever hesitant on whether I brought down an enemy with one shot or not, I would count how many shots until the next re-chamber by firing into the air. After the long haul of getting your one shot kills with this weapon, you can unleash it’s pure potential, which is chaotic CQC decimation.

* This gun excels at CQC almost as well as the S12 does, however that re-chamber thing can get a bit old and frustrating especially when it happens in a gunfight or after you have killed one of two enemies in a room. Laser sight is recommended for this gun, as you will want to pre fire from the hip and into aiming down the sights (hopefully by the time you re-chamber). Like all shotguns, build this one around speed and mobility. I am sure you have noticed that this weapon, like the S12, eats through ammo quickly, but is manageable by the re-chamber function. Do not hesitate to slap on extended mags on this; it does not add any more round prior to re-chamber, but you can let loose a bit more in terms of taking out groups of enemies. I found that this thing will take out people in one four chamber about the same as the Remington would in one to two shots, only this one is a whole lot faster! In hallways and stairwells you will have the advantage over people running toughness, as four shots relatively quickly renders the enemy stunned.  

* For your bloodthirsty challenges, take this as you did the S12, but play it a bit closer to the chest. You want to play smart with this gun: because each burst lacks the initial power of the S12 up close, you need to keep your spray a bit more condensed. I said it before and I will say it again, start firing from the hip and into aiming down the sights to tighten your spread, this will help you immensely in open areas. This gun is slightly challenging, but entirely manageable once you know how the gun works and in what areas. 

* **Summary**

For your bloodthirsty challenges, take this as you did the S12, but play it a bit closer to the chest. You want to play smart with this gun: because each burst lacks the initial power of the S12 up close, you need to keep your spray a bit more condensed.

1363867021.0,132,self.blackops2,1aq722,Something all of you should consider.,211,79,106,http://www.reddit.com/r/blackops2/comments/1aq722/something_all_of_you_should_consider/,"Hello before I start this topic I'd like to say a bit about myself. Basically I've been playing games both casually and competitively for over a decade now. I started playing video games since I was 5 and started playing competitive games since middle school.

One thing I want to discuss with all you gamers out there is that of personal health. Many of you play casually and that's great, but for those of you who put in those long sessions of grinding scrims, league, zombies, pubs, tournaments etc. You should really evaluate how much physical activity you are getting, the condition you play in, and various other things.

**On exercise:**

Make sure you are getting at least the minimum required exercise for a person of your sex and age. Many of you are young and the choices you make today will significantly affect your future. If you are into playing sports that is great, keep it up. For those of you who are not that active, try going on walks or jogs, or signing up for something like the gym or BJJ lessons or something, anything really as long as it keeps you active. If all you do is play games in your spare time it will eventually catch up to you. If you are a pro or aspiring to be a pro, taking care of your physical appearance is very important especially when trying to attain sponsors as well. As harsh as it may seem how you look can many times be more important than how well you play. Aside from that if you are someone who is physically fit you will perform better in game. Your reflexes will be better your brain will work faster you will be more alert and make better decisions, you won’t get as flustered in game etc. Personally I like running as exercise and I like to listen to podcasts and audio books while doing it. At first it was shitty and annoying and felt like a chore but eventually you get used to it and it makes you feel great across the board.

**Diet:**

Remember to eat healthy foods and don’t just sit there munching on junk or frozen foods full of preservatives all day. Eat balanced meals and take the time to prepare them. If you like snacking a lot while gaming consider healthier options. Personally I like stuff like carrots, celery, and other veggies you can eat while gaming instead of things like chips and cookies. For some of you it comes down to exercising more and eating better, but for others like me my main problem has always been skipping meals because of too much gaming. Missing out meals can be just as bad as eating unhealthy food. Remember to eat at proper times and if you find yourself to be someone who gets too immersed in gaming and loses track of time set alarms or reminders to remind you when to eat. 

**Eye care:**

Gaming creates a huge strain on your eyes and can take its toll over many years. Don’t stare at the screen all day, take breaks even if it’s something small like staring away from the screen or looking outside for a decent period of time. Make sure you get your eyes checked at least once a year and if you wear glasses/contacts that your prescription is up to date. Your eyesight will deteriorate at an even faster rate if you do not keep your prescription up to date.

**RSI:** 

Stretch after games, keep a good posture. Make sure you are using an ergonomic chair and you aren’t always in the same position with your wrists and fingers all the time. Standing up to circulate blood helps too, having poor blood circulation can lead to serious health problems in the future. I like to take fish oil for my joints, it really does help and make a noticeable difference.

**Hydration:**

Drink water. Lots of water, staying hydrated is important. Your body requires lots of water to function. One rule of thumb is if your piss is yellow then you are probably already dehydrated. This is especially important during events. Also on a side note try not to hold in your urine either, this is a very bad habit and can lead to huge complications in the future. If you need to go leave the lobby or go in between maps. 

**On mental health:**

If you find yourself getting too frustrated with the game take a break. This game is supposed to be fun and at the end of the day if you aren’t having fun you should stop. If people trash talking really gets to you just use the privacy features and mute features in game. Getting proper sleep is also important. Don’t stay up too late playing games especially if you have work or school the next day. You also need your sleep to perform optimally in game as well. For those of you who are pro or aspiring to be pro getting enough sleep especially during events is something you should take very seriously.

If any of you have any more health advice or tips geared towards gamers or if you want to give some insight on your own experiences then please feel free to share.

We are not the target market, nor are we the largest market, we just happened to be the most vocal. Our critiques are not representative of the player-base.

I don't think skill-based matchmaking was added to stop you from pub stomping, that just happened to be a consequence of it, rather it was added to stop noobs from *being* pub stomped. 90% of CoD players (i.e 90% of activisions customers) are not like those in this subreddit, they pretty much suck, and most of them probably love this feature - without even knowing it exists. 

tl;dr The game is made for the casual player, for they are most of the player-base, so before you criticise something just imagine how it effects your average joe - then ask yourself, did treyarch fuck up or is this exactly what they were going for.

So far the problem has yet to be fixed. Users are reporting that some game modes work such as zombies or the League play, haven't tested if this is true.

This issue has only been reported on the PS3 and is fair to say Treyach and Activision are not responsible for this mishap. Sony is appearing to have issues with all Activision related products available on PSN.

Will continue to update this thread as more updates come.

According to them:

* All ELITE clans will be transferred over to Black Ops 2 but will start from the very beginning.

* People who buy the Season Pass will get content the same day as those getting it when they're released, there is no early access any longer.

* By buying early you save a certain amount of money. Each DLC pack (there are 4 in total) will cost $15 separately, totalling $60, whereas the Season Pass will only cost $50.

* Xbox 360 will continue to get the content before other platforms, likely to be 30 days as it has been since MW2.

* There will be no inclusion of the Season Pass in the Hardened Edition or the Care Package Edition.

* ELITE will continue to support stat tracking of Black Ops and MW3.

* If you have an old ELITE Premium membership code, you can use it up until November 8th 2012, but Founder Status is no longer available with the game and service being almost a year old.

* Activision are in talks with Nintendo over bringing the Season Pass to the Wii U.

* They are looking at implementing ELITE support for both the PC and Wii U but they will not be available at launch.

That should answer a few questions people are having, from Activision themselves.

I like Domination's new round system, because non-symmetrical maps just wont be balanced, and every map has a better side, A or C (and pubs wont generally be able to swap the spawns well enough to flip it permanently), but the round system removed that issue. 

The new problem it made, however, is needing the addition of a timer to end the first round at some point. The best thing I can come up is ending round one when a total of 200 points has been reached by both teams. But that might not be possible with CoD's current game options.

If I'm missing something, or something I said is wrong, help me out and leave a comment.

Mods, any chance we could get this in sidebar? I see a thread posted like every day asking what all the changes are.

*************************

First and foremost: **new pick 10 create a class system**. 

Instead of just picking your primary weapon, secondary, grenades, perks, etc. You can pick any 10 items to have in your class. For balancing reasons, extra perks and attachments and the like cost an extra point (called wildcards. basically, if you want 2 perks in the perk 1 category, you equip the first one and then equip the wildcard called perk 1 greed. and then you can equip another perk in the first perk selection. 3 points in total. so you could have your primary (1) 2 attachments (3) two perks in perk 1 category (perk, greedwildcard, another perk) (6) 2 more perks in the next 2 perk categories (8).  secondary (9) and lethal grenade (10) and that's your class. really cool. other wildcards besides the one that allows you to have more than 1 perk in each category includes a wildcard that lets you have 3 attachments on your gun, one that lets you have 2 lethal grenades etc. 

**Zombie upgrades:** 

In addition to classic nazi zombie survival, there's a left 4 dead kind of mode where you move from place to place killing zombies as you go. There's also a competitive mode called grief mode where 2 teams of 4 are playing at the same time and you try to outlive the other. You can do things like modify the environment (blocking passages, etc) to try and make the other team die first. There are also stat counters and leader boards with zombie mode now to tract who's better than who.

**""Codcasting"":** 

CoDCasting is something in Black Ops 2, that allows players to live stream games to the internet while commentating and jumping around the action just like a real live sporting event. While watching a LIVE ONLINE game, you can switch between each players views, view the overhead maps with everyone's icons, even listen in to what the team is saying over their microphones. Not only will this make spectating a lot more fun, it's a lot of help and VERY useful for people who like doing commentaries.

**New Multiplayer features:**

(it wont number this first one for some reason)
You can play against bots now for your first 10 levels. 
&gt;In Black Ops 2, Combat Training users can earn experience points and level their online soldier in a mode dubbed 'Boot Camp.' In this mode, players face off against a mixture of human players and bots in matches of Team Deathmatch. Players can earn full experience points and level up to a maximum level of 10, which Game Design Director David Vonderhaar refers to as ""graduating.""
If comfort levels aren't high enough to jump into the fray online, players can stay within Combat Training and play through its 'Objective' mode, where two teams of six (3 players, 3 bots) compete in objective-based game modes. Players can rank up beyond level 10 in this mode, but are only given half of the usual XP they would earn online.
'Bot Stomp' is an experience point-free mode where teams of six players battle six bots in any gametype they choose. Playing this mode is a great way to practice skills, learn maps and modes, and is a ""really good way for newer players to experience the high end game,"" Vonderhaar says. All modes also include public matchmaking, to make finding optimal games easier.

http://www.joystiq.com/2012/09/27/how-black-ops-2-handles-prestige-adds-levels-to-combat-traini/

2. Another thing is that perks now ONLY deal with your person. stuff like making you run faster or sprint for longer, etc. There aren't any perks that makes you have better hip fire accuracy. Now anything that deals with your gun and shooting it, is changed by attachments. Attachments like laser sight helps hip fire accuracy now. Also, no more pro perks.

3. Added a game mode called hardpoint and a league playlist (more on that further down the list). Domination is also a round based game now where you spawn, there's like 5 minutes of normal domination play. Halftime switches sides, and then you play another 5 minutes. Whoever has most points at the end wins. This was made so there's no advantage based on where some teams spawn. 

4. The perk that makes you invisible to UAVs is changed. Now, if you're standing still, you will show up in the enemy's UAV as if you didn't' have the UAV invisible perk on. This will hopefully destroy campers. Also, another anti-camper tool is a new red dot sight that sends out a pulse when you aim down the sights and allows you to see through walls. He later made it so that if you're staying still because you're planting or defusing a bomb or controlling a score streak, you'll still be invisible.

5. There is now an attachment for your snipers that lets you use your iron sights with the sniper. They also added a bullet trail in the air for sniper rifles, so you can see where its coming from.

6. Your guns don't prestige with you. They prestige separately. So you can prestige your guy to go back through all the levels, but your guns don't de-level.

7. It's in the future! So all new guns and killstreaks!

8. Call of Duty elite is now free for all players!

9. Unlocking items have been changed now. Instead of just unlocking anything, or the CoD money system from Black OPs 1, it has been replaced by something completely new. Now, every time you level, you get a point. And you can spend that point on perks or guns or wildcards. There is more content than there are levels! So you'll have to choose wisely and will give players more reasons to prestige and move ahead.

10. Killstreaks? nope. Point streaks? nope. In this game, they're called score streaks. So instead of 3 kills and you get a UAV, or 3 kills/objective points and you get a UAV. In this game, a UAV is worth something like 325 points. So that would be like 3 kills and an assist. Or a couple objective kills (Flag defender = +150) and an assist. You get it.

11. One of my favorites, league play. League play is a LADDER BASED SYSTEM IN CALL OF DUTY. You are grouped with people your skill level. The first few games you are grouped with randoms and it places you in a particular skill group based on how you do. And then you move up and down the ladder (kinda like Starcraft 2). There's also no join in progress for these games!

EDIT: User funkytaco gave a little spreadsheet on the 2 different types of League games. [Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AmCqb1uaPPdpdHAwc1lSRThENE5ESHBRa0hENld3YVE#gid=18) is the spreadsheet.

11.Killstreaks can operate by themselves, or you can control them. This isn't all of them, but there are a few where you can release a drone and it goes around and kills people if you want it to, or you can control it. Or you could release it, control it for 10 seconds, realize an enemy is near you, stop controlling it, kill enemy, go back to controlling it.

12.Updated Crossbow information: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCbnqzt6ckI&amp;list=UUEHf6KUY7Zw7hlXQ7hDemwQ&amp;index=8&amp;feature=plcp

**Singleplayer ""Strike force"" mode:** 

The single player has these awesome side mission type things called Strike force missions. You control a WHOLE squad, and you have to complete an objective however you want. Its a SANDBOX STYLE mission where you can solve it in many different ways. You can play as the squad down on the ground, you can play as a chopper and gun down enemies from the air, you can play as a UAV and direct the squad to different waypoints. It basically just takes away the complete linear feel of CoD single player campaigns.

Also, single player now allows you to change weapons, perks, attachments, etc iN THE ACTUAL CAMPAIGN. There are also challenges to complete for every level.

**************************************
That's all I know about. The pick 10 system is definitely what I'm looking forward to the most, but I'm really impressed that Treyarch is ACTUALLY TRYING to do something DIFFERENT.

Here's some good tweets by David Vonderhaar about some other stuff. Not necessarily changes, just answers to some FAQs

Easy lobbies, 100+ first try [screen shots inside]",150,34,162,http://www.reddit.com/r/blackops2/comments/13ps7i/skill_based_match_making_what_happens_if_a_good/,"So back in black ops I would not lobby surf, if I got put against tryhards I would tryhard myself and if I got put against noobs I would crush them. I found both fun, *both*. I picked up BO2 a couple of days ago and started doing quite well but now (I’m level 35) I get put against 4th prestige people all with 1.4 – 2.6 KDR. As I said I like a competitive game, I’ve been winning at league play, but in pubs recently I’ve just been getting my shit pushed in. I consider 1 KD a terrible game, I’m sure a lot of you do, and thats been happening.  
  
So I made an account and messed around the first few games to give myself a 0.1 KD. These are the lobbies I got into; [lobby 1](http://i.imgur.com/2NPbL.jpg) (0.98 kd average) [lobby 2](http://i.imgur.com/gnBve.jpg)(0.85 kd average) [lobby 3](http://i.imgur.com/ptVGJ.jpg) (0.74 kd average) [lobby 4](http://i.imgur.com/sN7Hm.jpg)[ (0.56 kd average). So yeah, they were the sort of players you have time to [take a picture](http://i.imgur.com/oWnvE.jpg) of [whilst you’re bored waiting for them to kill you](http://i.imgur.com/Z0nVO.jpg). But what happens if you try? Well [first TDM](http://i.imgur.com/YLjpx.jpg) went well but I can do [better](http://i.imgur.com/eALGl.jpg). And these were with the default killstreaks. But TDM is so limited so I went over to domination and got [100+ on nuketown](http://i.imgur.com/6SqCc.jpg) first try. And then I played some capture the flag (only using spyplane) and got ranked [4th in the world all time.](http://i.imgur.com/goRl6.jpg)
  
 O btw I used my free trial for XBL that came with the game, it’s not like I paid to do this. 
    
Edit: Two more things, firstly these guys were really great to play against because nobody quit, even when I 100+ed), bad players don't care how bad they do. Also I want to point out that I also had an incredibly low spm so I guess it could be based on that but I don't think so. I rush, when I matchmake on my 1.6 KD account I'm usually top of the lobby but with an average KD.

1374955987.0,115,self.blackops2,1j6dnl,CoD:Ghosts camo code for BO2 to give away.,156,41,243,http://www.reddit.com/r/blackops2/comments/1j6dnl/codghosts_camo_code_for_bo2_to_give_away/,"***THIS GIVEAWAY IS OVER, THANK YOU TO ALL WHO COMMENTED!***

So today I pre-ordered CoD:Ghosts for PC. With it came a code for the ghost camo in BO2. However, it is only available for Xbox and PS3 which makes it pretty useless for me.

Rather than just handing it to the first person who comments I would like to give everyone a chance. So, **the person with the best reason as to why I should give them the code over everyone else will receive the code and instructions through a private message when this post is 24 hours old.** (typing ""GIVE IT TO ME!"" or ""ME!"" will not be a very smart way to approach this, be creative and really think why you deserve it more)

There is one more thing I will need to make this as fair as possible.

 Obviously the first people to see this are the ones who browse /new. To prevent them from just commenting and then downvoting to try and make sure no one else sees the post **I will not be giving away the code to anyone unless this post receives at least 10 karma** (note this in a text post so I will *not* be getting karma from this). **If it doesn't reach at least 10 in the 24 hours allotted I will just end up giving it to some console players I know IRL.**

Good luck!

**EDIT: I am reading ALL replies, even the hidden ones. People who are downvoting all posts but their own are not gaining any ground. They're just wasting their time.**

**EDIT #2: For those wondering what it looks like [here is a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f01wAdDu-XU).**

**Update: The giveaway is over, the winner has been notified and is enjoying his/her new camo as I type this. I'd like to thank all of you who took the time to comment, you certainly gave me a lot of reading material :P.**

Make a class that has only the combat knife and set the health to 200%.

 Perks I usually include are ones like lightweight, extreme conditioning and dexterity .

If you don't want people able to hide then turn the radar to sweeping and give the players ghost so that if the stop moving they show up.

Bigger maps are better for this and ones like drone seem perfect for it.

Team with the most kills win!

I am going to post each class as a comment so that you guys can upvote the ones you like.  Later I might add whichever ones are the most popular here.

SmellsLikeHerpesToMe was an incredible gentleman and put all of the classes together on one list.  Please go below and give him the karma he deserves.  Honestly, I dont see what the big deal is but Im nothing if not a slave to social pressure so here it is.
