I love this subreddit, I try to be active in it when I find time too. It's great to have an audience that are openly willing to give you feedback, especially when that audience contains some great designers.

What I've noticed a bit of lately is a stuck up attitude to a 'critique'. The idea of this community is to give each other feedback so we can all improve as designers, it's also great to read others feedback so we can learn even if we're not the one who submitted the original design.

If you submit a design, especially if you're new, it's likely there's room for improvement. True, peoples opinions on a nice design are different, but there are foundations such as use of the golden ratio, typographic hierarchy, page layout, colours and so on that all designers agree on. If you're design is missing some of these elements then your design will be **criticised**. Personally, I try to criticise all the bad points AND point out all the good points so people not just know what's wrong, but also what's right.

There've been several instances as the community has grown whereby people submit their work and react badly to feedback by arguing that their design is perfect or simply throwing toys out of the pram and deleting the post. This is not what this community is for, it wastes your time, it wastes others time and no one gets to learn anything.

* You will **never** need more than 3 fonts on anything. 
* More often than not, 2 is plenty. 
* I'm serious. Restrain yourself, never ever use more than 3 different fonts.
* If you must, use different **weights**, **styles**, or **colors** instead.
* (IMHO) Serifs on screen -- only in headers or logotypes, never as body.
* [Learn](http://psd.tutsplus.com/articles/techniques/a-20-minute-intro-to-typography-basics/) the basics of typography. It wont take 30 minutes. 
* Remember, you know what it says because you wrote it, but your audience doesn't have that luxury. **Never sacrifice usability for aesthetics** (because you're wrong: If I can't read it, it isn't aesthetic).

I hope this helps someone. I know it took me quite a while to let go of my rampant use of fonts, but it's doable! I still have a lot to learn, but that's what we're here for, right?

The target audience is small business owners.

Most of this time was spent getting the application interface right. The board didn't like my initial 'clean &amp; simple' approach and so i received orders to make it 'friendlier'. This was an abomination and grew into a horrible frankenstein of a project, which led to me redoing it in my spare time to show my OM how much better it could be, this included a product name, complete with logo and branding.

Anyway, that was approved which gave me a sense of elation. Then in the last few weeks i was asked to create login pages etc, so i came up with this:

http://i.imgur.com/Qc6qa.png?1

The other slides include a video and some examples of templates. Pretty standard stuff. Regarding the logo, i used the font 'bemio' for two reasons. The straight lines denote structure, and the curved edges give it a playful edge. Finally, turning the hole in the o into a spanner nut shape gives a subtle hint to the building nature of the product.

Anyway, since this has happened, there seem to have been some sharp u-turns in the boardroom. How much of this information has been delayed by my OM i don't know. But it now turns out a lot of the board don't like my design choices, including a couple who don't like the logo. One of the directors also owns his own smaller marketing agency who specialise more in print, and he commissioned them to do a mockup for the login screens:

http://i.imgur.com/i7Xwy.png

Needless to say, there is a lot i don't like about this, but is my ego getting in the way? Is my design actually good? I don't know what to think any more.

Bear with me.

I enjoy reading this subreddit. For me it's an opportunity to give back a bit to the community, as I've largely improved and become the creative I am today by consuming all the critique I've received over the years. I always desire to improve, and crave as a result raw and constructive critique. I was fortunate to receive a lot of that from someone who knew what they were talking about. 

However in here, I've grown concerned at some of the comments that designs have received. Many of the individuals who post work are students, amateur, or fresh out of school and are looking to improve. They get feedback that is abstract, unhelpful, and at times, misguided... and then they try to apply it to their work. They grow disillusioned on their struggle to follow advice like ""don't use gradients"" not knowing why they have to avoid them. ""Don't use dropshadows""... so I can never use them? Stuff like that.

Nobody has told me of this frustration though. What I have been told more than once are comments and appreciation from individuals on the critiques I have provided. How I have helped them really understand how they can improve as a designer, and not just the one design they shared. 

At the same time, I realize there is value in a response from a large number of people. The issue is that those who don't realize it don't understand how to sift through all the comments. Because we are all faceless, our initial comments hold similar amounts of weight.

I'm not exactly sure if this is an issue. I feel it is, but am not sure how to tackle it, if at all. Do we allow for user flair to link to portfolios? Mark users as competent? I'm not advocating these necessarily because they opens up uncomfortable questions, but it's definitely some options I've thought about.

Is this an issue? Or should I just accept that things will remain as they are, and as a subreddit there isn't a strong enough desire to foster a more constructive environment. 

Thanks for reading.

**TLDR**: I'd like to see more constructive feedback that actually helps those who seek it. 

edit: great discussion thus far. I just wanted to add that if nothing changes as a result of this, I'm fine with it. I will still post as I have before. I realize that this is far from easy to solve. 

edit2: How do you all feel about a system where the person posting can choose a 'rating' on how serious the critique they are looking for is? For example, someone with just a minor interest in design can seek a less serious critique compared to a working designer who desires serious critique. Regardless of the rating the OP should be expected to take the feedback seriously. This doesn't solve the problem of poor critique being given, but it is one idea we could adopt. Maybe. Thoughts?

I started building a flat share listing company called Room Central ([roomcentral.co.uk](http://roomcentral.co.uk)) back in early 2012 and only just launched it in April 2013. Since I started the build, the site has changed quite a lot, especially with new functionality being added all the time. At the time I was working quite heavy in the back end code and didn't have the correct vision for the site so I decided to ask a friend at an agency, 200creative to help out. Since we've started I've been quite happy with the design, I think it looks quite playful and easy on the eye.

Because it's my own child I've instantly got a bias to thinking its great, but at the same time I think there is still some improvements that could be made. What I would really like is for everyone on Reddit to let me know what they think.

We've effectively got three markets:
1. Professionals who are looking for flat shares in a city
2. Students who are looking for flat sharing in a city
3. Landlords who want to list their rooms for rent

It would be really helpful if I could have some feedback from each perspective where possible, i.e. Does the site look trust worthy, do you like the colour scheme, is there anything missing that you would expect to be there, how quickly does it load.

Something that I'm also really keen to have feedback on is the map user interaction. Does it do what you expect and provide the information that you need?

The theme has been built from the Twitter Bootstrap so hopefully that have given some good support in the longer run.

3. Kind of became a thing of circumstance. I had a bunch of old illustrations that I had collected from various places and started making them into patterns. I've been working with a textile design agency for 4 years, so pretty much everything I make has some sort of pattern to it at this point. Then I started to sit and deconstruct them, and that's how they happened. 

4. Honestly curious to see what people think. It's hard to judge people's criticism when you can only get it from friends/peers/family. The internet is anonymous, so people seem to be honest.

almost a year ago, probably when /r/design_critiques started, i'd posted some work here or there to this subreddit and i got the kick in the butt i needed to push myself harder and farther. i've learned to dig deep and not to hold back. 

since joining this subreddit i have been chosen, out of 700+ students, to be recognized as one of the top 10 in my college. i had my work displayed at a gala event at a prominent hotel in front of many local professionals. as a result i have been asked to do work left and right, and was even picked up to do work for a local firm on a intern-to-hire basis. the firm loves my work and i've already had more work piled on me. i have also had my photo taken along with my work to be featured in a national magazine. not a major publication but still a national design magazine; it's a start. 

i am not bragging and i hope it does not come off as that. i just wanted to thank this community for pushing graphic designers, like myself, to explore the full potential of our design solutions. i appreciate all of the professionals and novices that i learn from on a daily basis.

A small background on the studio. We specialize in creating and design labels for private and national food brands. The studio is currently going through a rebranding and wanted to create a modern look since we are considering expanding into designing in other fields since we do specialize in different things. when this logo was created a few things where considered

1. I wanted the idea of the finger square to be there since that was emphasized by the director.
2. Since food is still what we mainly work in I edited this so that it would have a flow and almost have a feel as if it is ""wrapping around"" the center without being too direct about it
3. Logo/branding work is something we are considering starting to look working into. so I wanted to have a simple minimal look with this

I am open to hear any other ideas others might have.

Hi! I've been working on this IRC client with a friend for a while and I'd really appreciate some feedback on the design. The above picture is a mockup made with Adobe Fireworks but implementation is well on its way. I'm a developer, not a designer, and this is my first real attempt at designing something.

If you're not familiar with IRC, here are the basics: Internet Relay Chat is a chat protocol in which users can connect to networks/servers that host channels, which are like chatrooms. Channels have topics and the users in them are ranked, with higher ranks being able to kick/ban/etc. Users can directly message each other (called querying or private messaging) in addition to joining/creating channels.

Some notes on the design:

* The darker icons to the left of the channels/queries indicate unread messages
* The red number to the right of them indicate ""mentions""/""highlights""; this is when someone mentions your username. It's a very common feature for IRC clients to beep and notify you when you're mentioned so that you don't miss someone directly addressing you when connected to a lot of busy channels.
* In the actual chat window, the lines highlighted in red indicate a mention, and the lines highlighted in orange/yellow indicate a notice or a CTCP. Notices are sort of like queries, except they display on whichever channel/query you currently have open instead of in a separate query window. CTCP (client-to-client protocol) requests ask the receiving client for some info (e.g. CTCP TIME has the client respond with local time, CTCP VERSION with the receiver's OS/processor/client name and version).

Thanks!

Edit: [Here's a really crude rendering done in illustrator of the carpet in an interior](http://i.imgur.com/uic2X9l.png). I just found an image, pasted the vectors in and rotated the carpet to perspective, and put in some gradients to approximate the shadows. 

Anyways, despite my obvious inability to figure out how colors work on the web, what do you all think of the design? My inspiration was cities and their skylines (the center motif is Chicago!). I wanted to keep some of the feel of a traditional persian or afghan rug, but make it much more modern and bold in its geometry. I like the colors, as I think they would look nice in a bright and modern setting and be fairly neutral, but I don't know how practical it'd be as an actual carpet.

* How well does the history work on the [bump listings pages](http://dev.bumpworthy.com/bumps/all)?  I went with an infinite scroll on those pages, but history is always an issue there.  I wanted to get the user back to the listings page about where they left off.  I feel like it works pretty similarly to how RES works here, but is there any way it could be improved?

* Moving to an HTML5 video player.  Does it work for you?  If your browser doesn't support HTML5 video, did it fall back to Flash gracefully?

* Do you have any suggestions for layout on the [Artists listing page](http://dev.bumpworthy.com/bumps/by_artist)?  I HATE the really long, single-column list, but it is the least confusing layout I could settle on.

We could make a thread once a month with the brief and people could submit their designs to the thread and then let the upvoting take place to decide what people do and don't like. If people don't want to lose karma on the whole thing we could have a rule that is basically don't downvote something because you don't like it, give it a critique instead. Upvote what you do like and at the end of the contest someone could win reddit gold or something(No promises on that one yet, i'm still in college and still need to eat lol).

Spent today critiquing portfolios on my main account. Been subscribed to this place for a while. And portfolios are the most fun to crit. Decided it was probably time to submit my own for review. 

Background:
I'm a senior graduating this year. I'm not looking for any freelance jobs. My portfolio is just what I'm submitting in my job applications. I'm applying to both design firms and startups. The person whose looking at this site and making the hiring decisions will probably be a designer (I wouldn't go to a startup if there is not a designer on staff already) or a HR person with design knowledge. Most the firms will be small. I do not want to go into big advertising or marketing firms.

(Haha, although my preferences might change to ""anything as long as I can support myself"" the closer it gets to graduation)

Also in case you're curious, I do have more work. However, since I'm a student (and I don't care about finding clients), I was told by quite a number of designers to show only a very select few. 6-8 being the max.

The problem now is that I need it to be finished for my website launch on wednesday. I'm really finding it hard to be objective at this point, having looked at it constantly over last few months.

[The latest progression](http://i.imgur.com/IIKi8Fl.jpg)

Let me explain:

#1 is what my business card design looked like with what I thought was my final logo last week. I made it while being well aware of the fact that I was violating a lot of logo no-no's, but I thought, ""hey, it's for design, so it I'll be in control of how it's used and will adjust accordingly."" The core of the logo is my name, the buoy, and ""designer &amp; illustrator,"" while the water was just a secondary element that I would use in any instance I could. I also was using the dashed lines and anchor as part of my system for my resume and website. As I was laying out the site, I realized the water doesn't work well, the colors look too gimmicky, and the logo itself is boring without the water.

My site design has gone to a white and grey color palette, and my resume and business card will too once I get the logo figured out.

So after doing more reworking, I've progressed from #2-#7

I've gone back to the tried and true black and white logo (sort of, gray-scale really). I tried to keep the geometric illustration style, but I'm realizing I just like it because it's a hip style that I enjoy, but it's not really adding to the logo.

By #5, I'm back to just 2 colors of gray. I like the direction it's heading, but I'm getting worn out. #4 felt like the buoy was a weird dot on the ""I,"" so I moved it and scaled it a bit for #5. #6 felt like the buoy was too grounded while it was sitting on the baseline, so I moved it up to make it appear more like it's floating for #7.

That's my long shpeal. I could use any feedback right about now, so hit me hard with whatever criticisms or suggestions you might have. I really appreciate the help!

-Are there any glaring things that would prevent people from using it?

Also did the quotes at the bottom in [ZXX](http://www.fastcodesign.com/1672908/a-typeface-designed-to-thwart-nsa-surveillance) which suited the theme almost perfectly, but didn't look particularly [legible](http://imgur.com/vckhimd) when set against the book text (although it does look pretty cool.)

Font used was Franchise Bold, and the image comes from wiki. Text came from Project Gutenberg.

**Target Audience:** non-profits and small- to mid-size businesses who are ready to take the next step in organizing and streamlining workflow, so that they can responsibly, efficiently grow into their next phases (businesses that are still manually entering time sheets- or having multiple people put hands on the same piece of work because no one has taken the time to figure out the best way to approach the task- they've just been doing what they have to do to get by- Concilium comes in and streamlines).  
  
**The Mark:** based off of gantt charts, which are used by a variety of people when it comes to completing projects and project workflow, and which this company will use.  
  
**Colors = Main Concern:** client's unsure about the colors. I'm pretty sure about them- but the clients and myself are all avid redditors and we were hoping you guys might be able to critique these colors. The idea behind them is that primary colors are building blocks- so the blocks (golden rectangles) in the abstract gantt chart mark are simple shapes/primary colors and set in logical increments, leading upwards into the name of the company (""using logic to turn your company's basic elements into something greater than it is now, through order""). I've muted the colors a little, to refine them a bit (since primary colors are kind of loud and often seem cheap).  
  
**Looking Ahead / Further Branding:** the idea here is that these muted primary colors will be used throughout the branding material as accents rather than large expanses of color. We want to keep materials focused on what is necessary, and keep it relatively buttoned-down, as far as branding goes. The idea behind that is simplicity, not only because this company is giving clients materials and processes that they just need to use to make their processes more efficient (and not be dazzled by branding- this is not a business of luxury, entertainment / delight), but also because it works well in keeping with the idea of ""trimming the fat"" and just getting right down to business.

I'm looking for some feedback on my site re-design that I've been working on for about a month, about five hours a week (if that). I've been working on the site strictly in HTML/CSS/JS instead of going from a mockup. I figured it'd be a good exercise.

That aside, our target audience is two types of folks:

1. Small to medium sized businesses
2. Marketing firms, and creative firms in general who we often partner with.

Without further ado, http://studioaceofspade.com/saosv3

The goal is to be responsive (not there yet on phones), as well as to convey who we are extremely quickly. 

The other thing that I'd like to point out is that our messaging is key. On our other site designs that we've used, we have done extensive A/B testing looking at whether or not it's more important to have messaging up top, or portfolio items, or to try and squeeze in both. It turns out that messaging resulted in a 20% higher contact rate and 40% more page views (just that one change!). People who were interested would just go straight to the portfolio.

Anywho, thanks in advance!

EDIT: The site is best viewed on widescreens (+1680px wide). We have not done a different layout for a lower resolution, so yes, I am very aware that this will appear HUGE on smaller laptop screens.

I did my best to incorporate people's suggestions (at least the ones I had time to address.)

I think the texture adds depth and helps unify the background with the illustrations. Thoughts?

Additionally, I worked on alignment and spacing, but that is certainly not my strong suit. So please let me know if there are any glaring errors!

Also, I really appreciate everyone's thoughts on the legibility aspect. I have my concerns, but this dark background/white lettering, as well as these specific fonts, have already been approved by the client. (I made a sign in the same style as this menu that went over well.) 

Thanks again! I'd love to hear thoughts on the most recent version.

The menu is to be printed on two A4 sheets and folded down the center (the vertical white lines in the center of the images mark where the fold will be, and are not part of the final design.)

The basis of the design is a combination of chalkboard lettering and vintage tattoo/pin-up girl style. All the illustrations are mine. I'd love to hear your feedback re: the layout and balance. 

Also one area of concern for me is the second pin-up girl on the inside left page. She is actually from an earlier project that went unused. I'm wondering if she stands out in a bad way because the rest of the illustrations are in a different style. I think it works, but that might just be me wanting to save time :)

Some of you might have seen this site while it was up - it got an unforeseen amount of press - but after being shut down I found that I still wanted some critique on the design.

I am trying to cultivate myself as a developer who keeps a strong appreciation and execution of design in my work. For this project, I really wanted to embrace grid design while keeping things simple. 

Part of the test for me was to have a site with a consistent design but also to make user pages utilize the styling those users keep on their actual twitter accounts. Some parts, the header on the user pages for example, were a little rushed because of deadlines, but otherwise I like the way it turned out. 

I should say, it looks best on computers with Helvetica Neue installed in addition to a browser with Javascript enabled, but I did make attempts to provide an alterative in both cases.

Thoughts? Could you also take a special look at little interface decisions? An example of this can be seen [here](http://undetweetable.com/SnoopDogg/90191642484682752) if you click the users name.

However this is how it looks in mobile:

They look cluttered, and you can't fold/unfold the deepest level of dropdowns. It just doesn't allow this.  

I'm thinking there are better ways to represent information in mobile view. My approach was when person touches 'buildings/land' tab, i replace bottom navbar with contents of Buildings/Land, thus reducing one level of dropdowns. 

Question: 
I'm really not experienced in developing UI. Is my approach sufficient?

For my first site I wanted to try and make it serve as many purposes as possible this early in my design career. I decided to try designing my own RSS aggregator similar to PopURLS for personal use, but I also want it to look decent enough to put in my portfolio. I've been studying HTML/CSS for almost a year so I also wanted to use this project as an opportunity to push my boundaries beyond my comfort zone, so I decided to implement jQuery and soon after starting work I found that I'd need work with PHP(SimplePie) to parse the RSS feeds.

I split the feeds into categories so that when you click a category bar, that category expands/contracts in order to reduce scrolling, especially in a tablet pc environment, and as an excuse to get a feel for javascript/jquery.


I have most of the core functionality done, still have to do some optimization, but here's what I have so far (only works in w3 standards compliant browsers as of now):

I'm wanting to do something with the background to give the the content a little more pop/depth so any advice on how to accomplish that or resources to help would be great

This year at camp he will be missed by many, so I am designing a little patch in his memory. I'd love some criticism on it.",12,2,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/design_critiques/comments/1dpq3v/logoa_friend_and_coworker_recently_passed_away_h/,"So his nickname was ""Curty"", the summer camp is for middle school students, there are field days twice a week and field trips twice a week.  Field trips are to the beach, water parks, amusement parks, and so on.  He was legendary for his infectious giggle, warm attitude, and he was a master of dodgeball game variations.  

The C in his name is supposed to represent a dodgeball, the small circle at the top is the fill hole for the dodgeball.  The green hills are there to represent field days, but they are also intended as a little bounce for the ball.

The sun character is Curty, he always wore black oakleys, and he had a buzz cut.  He always gave people big hugs, so the rays are meant to represent his buzz cut up top and his outstretched arms and warmth radiating.

The blue is there to round out the circle and to represent water because with two field trips per week, at least 75% of the trips revolve around water, beach, etc...

The font is admittedly a ripoff of the disney font, it's called waltograph, and I got it from [dafont.com](http://www.dafont.com/walt-disney.font).  It works though, because he loved disney and recently took a trip there with his family earlier in april before he passed.

One key spot I am bothered by is the circle at the top of the letter C.  I think it needs to be there to help define the C as a dodgeball, but I am debating making it thicker to follow the theme of the font more closely.

This post is building on a previous one [found here](http://www.reddit.com/r/design_critiques/comments/1azkzl/google_chrome_extension_ive_created_a_youtube/).

[What do you guys think?](http://i.imgur.com/17zh9K8.png)

I honestly absolutely love the design. 90% of my friends do, too. The only worry is that the S is too similar to that of Skype's icon. Not in that it would be a TM infringement, only that it could be confusing.

The reason you see a variety of icons is simple.. a Google Chrome Extension can update its icon dynamically to reflect state. So, when you turn the volume up/down.. the bars will increase/decreases proportionally. Similarly, if the player is playing -- bars are green. Paused is represented by yellow (needs to be yellower) and muted is represented with red.

Thoughts? Ideas? Going to probably have this commissioned tomorrow.

PS. About 50% of the items in the portfolio are just old items that I had on my work computer. I am going to be updating it with better quality work once I get done with all the structural and coding work.

**EDIT 1:** 
Changed the navigation so the navigation is now at the TOP of the page and stays there constantly and removed the scroll to top button since it's now un-necessary. Changed some of the wording and removed the white bar as per reddit's recommendation.

Made some visual changes, fixed the navigation and setup forwards, favicon etc and launches the sucker. I won't push the site or publish that it's live until the first but it's live as of tonight.

[http://imgur.com/EL522](http://imgur.com/EL522)

It is intended as a [Moo mini card](http://us.moo.com/products/minicards.html), so will be fairly small when printed.  Also, the invader and pixel font on the back is much crisper at full res and aliased. Obviously, the phone # and email were changed before the upload.

Any feedback? Is the ""Code. Design. Invent."" tagline cheesy or pompous? Please feel free to tear it apart if you don't like something; I am not thin skinned, and take criticism well!

A little background: I do some freelance code and design work part time for a fixed set of clients, and spend the rest of my time on personal projects/entrepreneurial development.  I do some physical design as a hobby, and often work with wood, which is the source of the front motif.  I also have a passion for game design, which inspired the space invader (which I made in sketchUp) and pixel font on the back.   I am not looking for work, but always love to meet new people and make new friends, so this card is meant as a simple way for me to pass along contact information to people I meet.

I am designing menus for my small mom &amp; pop BBQ restaurant.  This is the cover page.  We currently just have spreadsheets of our menus made up, which we print and laminate.  I'm looking to create something a little more professional-looking and eye-catching than these cheap, tacky menus we're using now.

I am using GIMP for photo manipulation (have taught myself what little I know about it over the past month or so) and PrintShop 2.0 for the actual layout manipulation.  The more I learn about GIMP, the more I'm considering dropping PrintShop from the program altogether.  It's like Playskool GIMP, barely more functional than ms Paint.

Note that the wooden pig is actually a 5' tall chainsaw carved pig that sits in our restaurant.  :-)

Things I don't like:

* The word ""menu"" and it's wooden background
* The campfire background of the page (I've struggled and struggled with finding the right background, this is imho the lesser of the 1000 evils I've tried out.  Suggestions please!)
* The border - maybe.  Is it too thick?  Does it need a border at all?
* All of the empty space in the bottom quadrants of the page, to either side of the pig.  But what could go there?
* The whole d#%* thing.  :-)


Things I *do* like:

* Our logo - probably because I didn't design it.
* The pig - he's sort of an icon/mascot.  His sizing or location are fair game for changes, though.

Thanks everyone!

EDIT:  I can take it.  Keep it coming...  The cold hard fact is that hiring someone to do this is out of the question.  We're struggling to make payroll most weeks, occasionally bouncing checks to suppliers, etc...  Trying to revamp our image through the menus a bit in order to increase value perception.  [Here is what my customers are looking at right now,](http://i.imgur.com/E7iFQYJ.jpg) to give some perspective.  They are printed on basic cardstock and laminated using a home thermal laminator.

I am an in-house designer for a custom apparel company called CreateMyTee.  There's a big back story to the situation, but the basics are that we've been a little bit stuck on where to go with the concepts generated by an outside designer, so I contributed some ideas of my own, some of which build off of the outside designer's concepts and some of which are more original (many were also pretty loose/rough.)  Turns out we're still stuck.

[Here is a link to a handful of the concepts.](http://imgur.com/TfsbiHE)
Some of them have pretty much been crossed off the list by the decision-makers but I included them anyway because I feel like they have promise.

In the concepts that employ 3 abstract elements, these elements would (at least in marketing materials) relate to the company's core competencies of design, speed, and service.

We're making a prototype, but we would really like to hear what you think about it while it's early, and we can still change things. We've designed interactive things before, but a lamp is a first for us.

And I've struggled with this one, finally being able to settle with ”It's ok if someone thinks it's too X”, as long as I'm comfortable with it, and it's not simply unusable as a logo.

But then I grew curious. So here goes:

**Background:**

I'm a freelancing graphic designer and illustrator. This is my personal logo. The process went back and forth, just feeling my way forward. I started with keywords like ”bold” and ”geometric”, but was not sure if it was going to be a monogram, a logotype or simply a symbol, what words to abbreviate (”designer”, full name, … ) and so on.

Then I simplified. Down to the initial of my first name (I don't need another name when being my own business), and combined it with the simplest symbol for graphic design and illustration: the pencil.

I have not settled on a color scheme yet, which goes hand in hand with my coming portfolio site.

As Jeffu had suggested earlier, maybe adding some type of tag/flair to users so people asking for critique know when someone is offering professional criticism. I know this is probably not something everyone wants, as even I'm not so sure, but it would add a little something something to people commenting surely.

But yeah, maybe a mod can offer some sort of ""contest"" to designers here to create a header logo as well as sidebar logo for the page, where users can vote on which we all prefer? And also during that time will be able to find someone willing to customise the page css, giving it a bit of life. I would suggest myself, but kinda cba as I'm sure there will be many others here who would want to have a go.

Just a thought, I like coming to this page but feel that seeing as there are so many designers in here now, we could at least have some sort of style and character here.

I am a graphic design student and this is a project I'm working on for an advanced typography class. The project involves creating a beverage brand/logo relying primarily on typography. I decided to create a brand of Hard Cider. I played around with a few different names that mostly seemed nonsensical, nothing really much to do with cider. Then someone in brainstorming half-jokingly said ""Bad Apple,"" and I decided I would go with it as a challenge to myself to see if I could give this silly name any weight with the design of the brand.

My intended audience was originally the quirky microbrew crowd, but I honestly don't think I hit that mark very well. However, I don't think it looks fit for the generic wine cooler market either, but I could be wrong.

Here's my first rough concept:

http://i.imgur.com/WYyKJ.jpg

I wasn't sure about the fruit icons - they seemed lacking. Like polygonal blobs of color. I also wasn't sure how to incorporate texture to them without bringing it into overkill territory or taking away from the logo type.

After a round of feedback, I came up with this:

http://i.imgur.com/jQwWo.jpg

My thought was to use this apple-shaped logomark throughout the flavor series, and use color and flavor name to distinguish between flavors. But I wasn't sure if that would be too boring. A friend giving me feedback was kind enough to mock up a couple extra samples, suggesting I incorporate a kind of ""flavor icon"" into the upper band with the flavor name:

***Here is the description I had under /food/:***

Like most of you, I'm an Anthony Bourdain, travel-food show junkie. I love seeing these distant places, people, and dishes that one day I hopefully will be able to experience for myself. To foster this idea, Housefed lets you find other foodies in your hometown and share a home-cooked meal with them. When you are traveling, then you'll be able to tap into the Housefed community to meet a local cook and book a meal in their kitchen. It is letting people share their food with people who wouldn't normally be able to try it.

So far a lot of people have signed up in anticipation of the meal-booking aspect which I fully opened this week. There are hosts in the US and UK that you can see their dishes, and book a meal with. Right now there are 2 meals in San Francisco that people can book a seat at.

Our goal is to create a site where people can go to find words that are related by subject, rather than meaning (thesaurus).  We're targeting anyone that needs to write anything.

**A few things:**

* We realize the front page is bare.  Suggestions welcome.
* Not terribly interested in legacy browser support.  FF, Webkit, and IE 8-9 is all we intend to support.
* Search is wonky at best

I enjoy the art of design, have long lurked, and even tried my hand at commenting around here.  But I am not a designer.  I am a biophysicist.

My subject seems fairly ""designogenic"", but again, I am no designer. I have two objects (proteins) I need to represent.  One is called 'Notch,' one is called 'Delta' (Δ).  These objects fit (bind) together.  And they do so while extending from the surface of a cell.  I would like to find an aesthetically pleasing way to represent these objects in my work.  As these objects do not yet have known structure I can take some creative liberty to represent them.  And I'd like to do so.  I just don't have much of that creative part.  The images will eventually have variations and manipulations made to them which would represent my own manipulations of the protein. They would be used mostly in Keynote presentations.

Here's [what I've got](http://imgur.com/4TVTE).

If you [search google](http://www.google.com/search?q=notch+delta&amp;hl=en&amp;prmd=ivns&amp;tbm=isch) I think you'll find that for as amateur as my images are, most are truly ugly.  For something I will spend years of my life working with I'd like for it to be more pleasingly represented.

1) What exercises or techniques might you suggest to bring about a better form other than just scribbling on a sheet of paper?  (I'm a poor scribbler)

2) Are there any good sets of iconography that 'interact' with each other on a regular basis that I can take lessons or learn rules from?

3) Illustrator.  It's kinda hard...

The ""upcoming webinars"" div fluctuates in length by a fairly large degree. Sometimes that big blank space will be taken, sometimes it won't. What can I do to make it a bit less empty when there aren't many webinars going on that week?

I just launched it tonight. It's a wordpress theme I made. It will look better when there are more articles posted and the homepage fills up a bit more. I'm having trouble getting the pointers at the bottom of brown boxes (blockquotes on pages, twitter updates on the homepage) to display correctly for all browsers, but that's more of a technical thing I need to fix.

I'm a little worried that I overused the background image (on every page other than the front) without thinking how it affected the content, but it can't think of what to replace it with. It's very appropriate for bio, mildly so for music and info, but it doesn't apply too much to store. I might remove it for the store page to allow more space for products and just keep the faded logo in the background. 

I'm also looking for suggestions on alternative formats for the music page, as it's very important to the site.

Thoughts?

I'm not a logo designer, or even a novice once. One friend has offered to build a website for my father's dental practice, and he needs me to design a logo. While I have decent experience on Paint.net, logo design is a completely different animal--that and paint.net isn't really the right program to be using. 

Nonetheless, these are some ideas that I have:

Do you guys have any thoughts on these? Is there, perhaps, someone that can help me out if I am on the right track? I feel a bit overwhelmed at the moment.

Thank you!

The planning for this begun after I discovered the location of this huge grassy field. After finding such a place, I instantly thought (having a photographers mind) ""I want to do something cool here"" and as I thought through it, the appeal of just having someone do things standing in the grass wasn't too good. I decided I wanted to add some real motion to this shoot and ended up borrowing a small trampoline to have the models jump of off. To keep this concise, the blankets, dress color and post processing came from inspiration as we pulled everything together for the shoot.



The final shot includes composite shots taken at the same time in order to form the final image.

Here's a step by step to give you an idea of how I went about doing it.

Now for you camera junkies, I used a Canon 5dIII, 70-200 F/2.8 IS II, and some flashes: Canon 600rt and 430exII. And of course photoshop and lightroom.

-The use of the logo is weird because this is one of the 4 restaurants on the resort, so regular branding doesn't really apply 100%.

- Mainly this will be on the menu (maybe) and a big wooden sign.

-The client wanted an oval around the logo and grill marks. I avoided using grill marks because it really kills the ""quality"" look of the logo. MIGHT ad a washed out look if the client insist.

I feel like the oval makes it look too much like a room number or address.

I'm also worried about the little swirls not translating well to print (im a pre-press guy by profession)

** Asking the client if they actually want the word steakhouse in the logo or not.

***Just 1885 it is.

****So stumped on this one.


-----------------
Update;


Second set:
1. obligatory what client wants.

2.I think getting rid of a border all together really helps this logo, the underlining strip is supposed to mimic the marks of a grill. Also it helps makes this logo aesthetically pleasing. Although as im typing this I realize they should go the other way to provoke ""flow"" as the viewer is reading. 

3. If they really want a border choose something other than a oval so it doesn't look so much like a hotel room number.

What the client wanted originally was grill marks through it, which I thought really took away from the ""classy"" look. 



I was going to add custom flourish inside the borders to fill the dead space, but they would really serve no purpose just extra crap.

After a few iterations I've worked it down to one simple shape per letter, using negative space to partly form the letter forms, it is a tad abstract and obscure/illegible but in my opinion it's not crucial that people know what it is instantly (nike logo is not in fact a tick, it is the wing of the greek goddess Nike, goddess of flight, or so I was taught) , I may make it more obvious on my portfolio site through animation.


So let me know what you think, I'm a fan of minimalism and so maybe the shadows and gradients and hexagon background are way overboard, but removing it all that leaves it as a couple boring triangles. Not sure what to do.

Bascially the society is made up of doctors and professionals at the hospital, and is there to oversee things like holding events, fundraises, stuff like that. And on that note, that is the target audience.

Both the hospital and society have been around for about 150~ years and have an extensive history, but my client has said he would like to put more of an emphasis on focusing on the future rather than the past.

I am trying to capture the essence of the society, and create an identity that shoes both structure, connection and community. The reason I have chosen the hexagon is because the actual hospital logo features a 6 sided star that indicates 'hope for the suffering', so it is a nod to that. The hospital logo is also a shield, which I think when turned on the angle its on now, somewhat resembles that.

I haven't put any thought into the type yet. I am more after feedback for the image.

Basically Illustrator's pen tool and I are best friends. I'm no good with color, simply positive and negative.

PM me for my portfolio I threw on carbonmade, consisting of work done for the lab, some undergraduate projects, and random pieces I've done on the side for the last couple years. What do you guys think of carbonmade, anyway? I just found it appealing because it's so simple and...DUH FREE?

I know I'm marketing myself with a very narrow specialty, but I would really appreciate some feedback on my work, how it's displayed, and where to go with it. As I said I'm very new to this field and need all the help I can get. Does this display look adequately professional? Is it worth it to go to graduate school for design with a bachelor's degree already under my belt? If you were me, how would you market yourself?

Hi all.
A while back I posted on here and /r/design looking for critiques on web design after my previous designer had been incredibly unreliable. Just wanted to give you all an update now the site is live!

I took a lot of your feedback on board, and there's lots of amends that will be glaringly apparent in the site design now.

http://www.controltheriot.co.uk/

1. The hierarchy of content has changed as per feedback. Date now takes a less prominent role.
2. All fonts have been updated to use Google Web Fonts.
3. The search bar was improved as per feedback.
4. The icons on the slider have been moved and resized to be more apparent.
5. Copy has been added to the feature image to make it more immediately obvious that it links to an article.

Just thought people might appreciate an update and like to see that their advice was taken on board! Really appreciate everyone's help, and wanted to say thank you to the community.

I was attempting to create something straightforward and clean, but still slightly whimsical and ""cute.""

The color scheme is self explanatory (I hope) and suggests a night sky. I'm on the fence, however, on whether or not the constellation should be brighter. On the one hand, I really like the subtlety, but on the other, I of course don't want it to be lost if it's on the blue background.

Through this program, I also receive the opportunity to work on co-op in the design field for one semester each school year.

[HERE](http://www.coobatis.com/) is my online portfolio, which I send to co-op employers in hopes of cinching an interview. I also occasionally do freelance work on the side and will direct potential clients to this site, as well.

I would like any critique concerning the layout of the site, my personal branding (both design and language), or anything else you may have to say!

**A few things to keep in mind:**

-I coded this website myself after a few courses in HTML, CSS, and a bit of Javascript. I want this site to look as good as it can be, but while my skills may be limited, I still feel it's important for me to code this myself in order to showcase that skill I possess. I view using a platform like Squarespace as being a cop-out for me personally.

-I want to convey that I'm approachable/friendly and professional, while still having a slight cheekiness about me (which I also enjoy spreading into my work when I'm able).

-The work is diverse because our list of possible co-op choices is also diverse, so for now I do not want to pigeonhole myself into a certain area.

-I have some newer work I still need to add, including an interactive app (school), logo/branding projects (school and freelance), and environmental design (co-op).

-Although freelance clients are directed here, since I mainly use this for co-ops — which already have established rates — I am not listing any personal rates.

**Font, Colour and Size of**
* Title headings,
* Sub-headings,
* Body text.

**As well as:**
* General website layout
* General website content
* Background design
* Use of basic website principles i.e. CRAP (Contrast, Repetition, Alignment, Proximity)
* Anything else you can talk about.

Also, I've made a comparison of two different layouts for one of the concepts. 

If you could assist me in this project, that would fantastic!

These are only concept **sketches** so are just images I created in Photoshop, rather than functioning websites.

By the way, Wellington's colours are black and yellow, hence I've chosen them as the primary colour scheme.

Also, the navigations on each concept I thought it would scroll down with the user scrolling down also, hence all the white space down its column.
 
I wouldn't mind if you gave me straight feedback on this post, rather than the instant.ly link below, as you could probably be more detailed with this method.

The bare concept is that of transferring sound into textile design using both literal and lateral methods. 
I ended up using vibrations to transfer the sound for the splat design by bouncing paint off speakers and catching it on silk. I then Photoshopped it into a commercialised design which was then printed onto cotton poplin.
I recorded everyday sounds such as the toilet flushing, kettle boiling and light switch etc. These were the sounds I used to produce the samples and designs.
The other design is on pure silk and is a mix of screen printed sound-waves and laser cutting. It is predominantly pouring water as the sound-wave source, which I thought was pretty cool.

It's my personal showcase. The idea and reason behind assigning each page an unique color is because each page (music, film, design) is each a different creative side of me.

First, thoughts behind it:

I'm very into simplistic, minimal design, and am trying to reflect that in the logo. I'm also going for an logo that is very stand-alone, and has a 'symbol' feel to it. Related to that, when the logo is present with my work (portfolio site or what have you) I don't want it competing; the works should be the focus at that point.

My initials (NL) are present in both of the linked logos (albeit more noticeable in the first).

I was going for clean, minimal, and trying to reflect my design style and thought process. It doesn't say 'creativity' a whole lot to me though, so I'd particularly like input on how to address that.

I'm planning my first portfolio site. I have always been hugely into minimalism when it comes to design. And while I plan doing/displaying other kinds of work in this portfolio, minimalism is going to be the main theme building it. And it feels appropriate starting with the logo.

The colors are just something I threw together for this presentation, but might be used in the final iteration. I like the concept of having [a logo that isn't always the same color](http://www.behance.net/gallery/Casa-da-Musica-Identity/4745703).

I'm not sure what letters people detect while looking at this. But I assume 'P I'. That is not correct though. The correct answer is PÖ (the swedish letter Ö), with the [Diaeresis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umlaut_%28diacritic%29)(dots) mashed together into a single line. It's not really a huge concern how people read it thoug, atleast not to me. [Here is an older version that didn't make the cut, just for comparison](http://i.imgur.com/6r7qP.png).

My target audience for this is engineering/research organizations that are searching for interns, entry-level temps, or part-time workers.  (I am also applying to some business and some communications positions, and the content is slightly different + I make the relevant skill--leadership, communications--the orange one).  The purpose of this work is to make an employer do a slight double-take during resume review and offer me an interview to find out more. 

I'm not a graphic designer by occupation, so I would be very grateful for any feedback you could provide on the design.  I'm particularly suspicious of the following items:

* Font in general - I'm a bit unsure of the Raleway/Calibiri pairing, and I think I might have too many different typefaces within the document.  I know that Raleway could be difficult during printing, and I have yet to test that. Thoughts?
* Layout/whitespace on the first page - something looks a bit off, but I don't know what.
* Timeline on the second page - I'm trying to figure out how to integrate slightly more information to make it much more useful (education, positions, etc.), but I'm at a loss.  At the moment, it is supposed to show how much time/energy I put into each area over time.  Any ideas?
* This is intended to be web/double-sided color print.  I'm making more versions for other situations - a b&amp;w one colored with black/grey/white and one that has easier margins to print.

Around thanksgiving I got really hammered at ""townie"" night in my home town college, and ran into a goofy kid that was wearing the same glasses as me.  After we both busted a move with some of the silliest dances I've ever done, I found out the kid was an electronic artist.  It turned out that he was doing his thesis with some of my old professsors on things that were near and dear to my heart (electronic music creation).

Anyways, Long story short, I was so hammered I told him I'd make him a logo, and I haven't yet delivered because I've been busy.

The elements he wanted in the logo were as follows:

I'm asking your help on what is the best of two logo.
I'm a French student and me and my friends along other students decided to create a new geeky association in my school. We named it ""Brigade Geek"", ""B.G"".

I was tasked to create the association logo, but someone decided to be creative too and made another proposal, and now we have to choose between these two.

We are a geeky association in a business school. Our target, and fellow students does not know this culture. They are all around 20 years old. That's why we decided to choose Vador as a symbol.
The chosen moto is : cool geek, hence the Raybans.
I retained the initials ""BG"", because it is not only initials but has another sense in french.

We want with this logo to affirm our identity and still be viewed as open and cool people.

I want your opinion on these two logos. Which is best ? Would you do something else ?

I've decided to try freelancing after several years working company/agency environments. I put together an overview of my work - as well as a brief ""sales pitch"" for which someone would want to hire me.

My target audience is small business owners. For this reason, I put my technical skills towards the bottom of the page.

Some of my friends have taken weekend ""photography for hobbyists"" courses, and suddenly got vastly better. I think I want to do the same: I will take a weekend *design* course. Can you think of a short course for people at my level, near Boston? (I live in Worcester.)

This is my first draft / concept for the logo, please make note that it's only a rough mockup so please ignore obvious imperfections. Colours are just random picks for now.

Looking for your feedback / critiques if there is any way I could improve the design. My goals for the logo are:

* To give an impression of ""fun"" and ""motion"", the logo should feel active
* For the ""C"" and ""M"" to be readable
* The story behind ""ComboMash"" is that I take a combination of art, tech and other assets and ""mash"" them together into a product. Part of my business will be providing prototyping services to other people putting together projects.
* To have a high resolution logo that I could animate in 3D for a splash video, while also being able to have it be useful for print documents (black &amp; white).

Anyhow, here's the album, let me know what you think!

Yes I'm aware the perspectives of particularly the slab/6pack don't really work, but I kinda designed them seperately as psd mockups (after doing the flats in illustrator) ~ and the awesome look on the bottle is thanks to the help of a 3d psd mockup I found, though of course the flat design is still all mine.

The slab looks a bit rough and nasty, but it's kinda what I went with after failing several times to get autocad/keyshot to work, it seems it'll take a lot of practice before I can use that for rendering..

I've been toying with an idea over the last couple days to create a 'manly' cider brand, just to see what I could have it look like. 

Many bottles already try to mimic beer for the sake of fitting in, but I wanted something a bit more over the top, and so after some brainstorming and sketches, I decided to use a bear for a mascot/branding.

Later with a suggestion from Dad, He gave me the great name 'Grizzly', which was good as I didn't like the original I'd named it ~ (Brutal Bear)

I recently discovered the Royal Docks Learning &amp; Activity Centre and when I saw [their current logo](http://rdlac.org.uk/RDLACwebLogo2.gif), I decided that I could probably do better.

With that in mind, here is [my redesign](http://imgur.com/LlwzC5Z) which is a lot more simple and professional in my opinion.

The icon is a jigsaw puzzle piece to have a link between the two logos, but also to represent connectivity (I'm guessing this is why puzzle pieces are in the current logo). The icon is also meant to show an abstract crown and anchor to represent the Royal Docks.

I'm posting here because I firstly want to know what I can do to improve the logo design, but I also want to know if you guys think it's worth contacting the Centre with the new logo.

Please let me know, thanks.
