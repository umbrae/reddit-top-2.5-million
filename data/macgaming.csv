It sounds silly, but it actually works.  I recently installed the skin ""PixelVision"" on my Mac thinking all it would do is change the look of Steam a little bit, but I was very surprised when Steam began working much snappier.  

Everything seems to load faster, the noticeable delay when clicking buttons is gone, the scroll bars actually work, it never bugs up and doesn't let me click buttons or scroll on pages, and, on top of that, I get a cool new UI.

If you want to try this, [you will have to follow these instructions.](http://www.jasonchen.org/log/2011/05/how-to-install-steam-skin-on-mac/)

I recommend using the skin [PixelVision](http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1914848) as well.

The only bug I have noticed is that some of the icons in the top bar are slightly off, but it's perfectly acceptable for me given the huge speed boost.

For some reason installing skins on the OS X version isn't completely supported so its a bit harder to get working, and you have to open some weird files, but its definitely worth it.

Once again, I really recommend this to everyone here who uses steam on Mac, it runs about 10x better for me with a custom skin and it's a much more enjoyable experience.

If any of you guys try this let me know if it makes your Steam run faster!

It runs decently within a Wineskin wrapper, but it has been a polarizing issue for people who believed it should have been a native port rather than a ""lazy"" wrapped port.

In any case, I've been scouring the Internet for information on this game, and one particular post on the Inside Mac Games Forum stood out. [Here is the link](http://www.insidemacgames.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=43407&amp;view=findpost&amp;p=409385) to the full post, but I've highlighted the important note here:

&gt;  The Witcher: Mac Edition is using an older version of the Wineskin engine (WS8 1.3.7), so I swapped out the 1.3.7 engine with the very latest 1.5 engine and performance has improved SIGNIFICANTLY. I mean it.

I thought that was really interesting, so I searched around some more and found a few more links from other forums linking to the same post and asking how to do it. The poster actually went into some detail on the instructions, but assumes some prior knowledge of using Wineskin. I took it upon myself to find out how to actually do it, and the instructions below are the culmination of hours of trial and error, and going through other how tos for other games and applications.

* First thing you need to do is to actually have a copy of The Witcher for Mac on your computer. Haha.
* Download [Wineskin Winery](http://wineskin.urgesoftware.com/) from [this link](http://wineskin.urgesoftware.com/tiki-index.php?page=Downloads), and don't try to be a smartass like I did and use the links from the Manually Installed Item Downloads section. As of this writing, the latest version is 1.4.
* Once downloaded, extract the ZIP file. You should have an app named 'Wineskin Winery'. You can run it anywhere, but you might as well put it in your Applications folder.
* Run the app. [This is how it looks like](http://i.imgur.com/167b7.png).
* We need to install an Engine. Click the '+' button under Installed Engines. The [latest version in the drop-down box shows WS8Wine1.5.1](http://i.imgur.com/9EnTY.png), but it lagged terribly on my machine, so I used WS8Wine1.5.0, and I would recommend you use that version too. (as an aside, if anyone manages to successfully use WS8Wine1.5.1, let us know in the comments). Press 'Download and Install', and 'OK' [on the next window](http://i.imgur.com/TG28N.png).
* Now we need to install a Wrapper. Back on the main screen, press 'Update' in the Wrapper Version box, and it will prompt you to download the latest Wrapper, [which of right now is Wineskin-2.5.4](http://i.imgur.com/hdbel.png). It shouldn't matter if you have a different version, we really only need the Engine for The Witcher, but we need a wrapper to create a new wrapper we'll be extracting a file from. But I'm getting ahead of myself. [Press 'OK'](http://i.imgur.com/KA4NS.png).
* After the download successfully completes, you should be back at the main window, and a new option available to you to 'Create New Blank Wrapper'. Press it, and [another window will come up](http://i.imgur.com/67D3g.png) for the option for you to rename the wrapper. It doesn't matter what the name is, we're not using it anyway. Continue, and [wait while your app is being built](http://i.imgur.com/vAStE.png).
* [You may get a prompt asking you to install a Gecko package](http://i.imgur.com/MY2Rb.png). At this point I just pressed 'Install', but I'm pretty sure you can press 'Cancel' without any disastrous consequences. During this time, the Wineskin Winery may look like it's become unresponsive, but just wait it out.
* Once it's complete, it will let you know where it saved your file. Choose 'View wrapper in Finder' to go directly to the app.
* Right click the app you just created, and click 'Show Package Contents'. There will be a folder named Contents, an alias to a drive_c, and an app named Wineskin. Take note of that app.
* In a new Finder window, open '`~/Library/Application Support/Steam/SteamApps/common/the witcher enhanced edition`'. The best way of getting to this folder is to just copy the above and Shift + Command + G (or Go &gt; Go to Folder...). It should show the app for 'The Witcher'. This would be a good time to **back up this app** somewhere safe just in case something goes wrong so you don't have to download the 10-ish GB game 3 times like I did.
* After you've **BACKED UP** the game, right click and 'Show Package Contents'. Remember the Wineskin.app from the wrapper we made earlier? Copy it here.
* Run Wineskin.app inside The Witcher. It will show you [a window with four options](http://i.imgur.com/AVHev.png). Choose 'Advanced'.
* In the new window there will be three tabs. [Click the 'Tools' tab](http://i.imgur.com/41gTh.png), and find the Change Engine Used button under Wrapper Tools, and press it.
* The next window should show the currently installed engine, and an option to update the Engine. Press OK. It will take a while to update, be patient.
* Once it's finished, press 'Done', and quit.
* Run the game from Steam. Enjoy SIGNIFICANT performance.

There are both Wineskin and Cider wrappers available, and the Cider wrapper seems to run well according to comments in the forum. Keep in mind, these are just wrappers, so you still need a copy of Skyrim to play it. I'm going to install it later on, and I'll let you know how well it works for me.

UPDATE: The Cider port appears to run flawlessly on a 2011 iMac. It was a pain installing, however. For some reason it wouldn't let me install the game in the wrapper, so I had to install it on Windows, then move all of the files back over. Also, it wouldn't start for me under the default resolution, so I had to edit the ini file to output native resolution. Some folks in the forum were complaining about fire not showing up properly, but I had no trouble with that. It stuttered for me somewhat on the ""ultra"" settings during fights, but runs smoother on ""high"", and much smoother on ""medium"". Overall, I'm pretty impressed at how well it runs. I haven't noticed any bugs to speak of, and, while it would probably run slightly better under bootcamp, it seems to run pretty well from the wrapper.

Granted, they may not be mainstream, or even modern, but provide entertainment nevertheless!

I'm sure many of you have heard of most of these games, but it really is mostly intended for those that come in here with the ""I just bought a mac...."" and ""What games should I play?"" questions. And of course, there are many, many more games that one could get. My list is mostly free games as I am a poor college student, and don't really have the money to buy games or pay for MMORPG's. This list really grows every month with new games as I find more and more gems, or save up enough money to buy something. And of course, there are various other games I have played that work for mac that are not here. If everyone wants to see a full list of all mac games I know off, feel free to ask.

**Here are all the games I currently have on my mac, no wine or bootcamp**

**Other info**

* If you don't mind more ""old school"" games, look through DOS games, and use Boxer to run them! Most of these older titles can be found for free on [Abandonia](http://www.abandonia.com/) and it's not illegal to get them!
* The Mac App Store has been getting some pretty snazzy games that can't be found elsewhere for mac, like Bio Shock (which Steam doesn't sell for mac). Don't forget to check that out.
* Steam's mac selection
* If you're tech savvy, or don't mind spending a whole day learning how to do it, [Wine](http://www.winehq.org/) is extremely useful for running many windows programs. It may be tough to use at times, but it can definitely be rewarding. 
* Some browser games aren't all that bad, and can provide short bursts of enjoyment! Don't hesitate to play those every once in a while!
* [Good resource](http://guides.macrumors.com/Free_Mac_Games)
* A lot of Indie games, especially those in development, you will only find via word of mouth or by stumbling upon them.

I installed it last week so I could play the beta of Banner Saga Factions. Decided to poke around the store. 

Ended up enjoying the demo of Defender's Quest enough to buy the game. The full version required me to update a library (Adobe AIR), which I did. So far so good.  

About two days later Steam required me to download an updated version of DQ before I could run the game again. And the updated version refused to launch. Checked the forums, developer had a comment saying ""Sorry guys, I broke the Mac version. I hope to fix it soon.""

Also, the next time I tried to play Banner Saga Factions I discovered that it won't work with the version of the AIR framework that is required to play DQ.

I'm not sure if this is just unlucky or if Steam games are constantly assassinating themselves and one another. Does Steam always suck to this degree?

**Updated to add:**

What I've learned: Steam is just a store. They offer convenient access to a good selection of titles but don't set their own compatibility or performance standards for Mac games.

My happy ending: The developer of Defenders Quest has been responsive to feedback in the forums on Steam. I've been sending additional bug reports via email and they've hooked me up with a version of the game that runs without Steam's involvement.

In the future: I'm going to keep buying games directly from the developers wherever possible.",,False,self,t5_2rk3e,1360931010.0,,,True,t3_18gwqg,http://www.reddit.com/r/macgaming/comments/18gwqg/does_steam_just_completely_blow_on_the_mac_or_what/,

My name is Sean, and I'm making a game by myself. More importantly, and more pertinent to this audience, it will support Mac.

The Good News: I was able to launch BMS by modifying an older version of [The Stanley Parable launch script](http://pastebin.com/uMnT8uRC) (did not try the version linked, but it looks like it should work) to point to BMS.

The Bad News: The game launched at some low resolution video mode. The settings window wouldn't open. At the end of the tram ride, the door doesn't open and you are stuck in the tram.

*Now back to my previous post*:

Anybody had any success making Black Mesa Source work on OS X?

According to the requirements, it needs the source SDK to be installed, and that requires windows. On the other hand, I have a bunch of source games installed. Anybody manage to piggy back off of HL2 or any of the other mac compatible source games?

First, i tried using Wine, it ran, but it was quite slow and laggy.

After downloading The Stanley Parable, i noticed that the application was just a folder with a .app extension. The folder included all the original windows files with instructions to run the mod through HL2. I figured I would try this with Black Mesa (Full Tutorial [here](http://pastebin.com/5QHx4AVL).) It ran perfectly, the train ride was smooth and didn't lag once. (Also other Source Mods such as Hidden: Source and Portal 2: The Core work brilliantly using this method)

I thought I had cracked it! But alas, no. There was no NPC to open the tram doors... There was no HUD.... The options would not open. I was heartbroken. 

I tried re-downloading/installing the files, but nothing worked. 

Tonight I tried to replace the files in /steamApps/steamID/half life2/hl2 with the files in /BlackMesa, and then run HL2 in Steam. (A method that worked perfectly for Portal: Prelude). Again, Black Mesa ran perfectly, but fails to load any NPC's / the HUD. 

Before resorting to alcoholism/hard drugs, i figured I would try reddit, maybe we could figure this out together... Any ideas? Known methods of installing other source mods that we could replicate with black mesa?

Most of the time I just use Boot Camp to go into Windows and play my Steam games there.  It's been out for a while now so I figured the issues would be fixed.  Just off the top of my head:

 - Steam crashes every time I exit.
 - If I start Steam when I'm not connected to the internet then I connect to the internet it will just go into a constant crashing cycle and won't be openable again until I delete files from the Steam folder.
 - Changing from Large Mode to Small Mode requires multiple clicks.
 - The Steam window is closed but Steam is running and I'll do something random like opening a folder and it causes my Steam window to appear as if I'd clicked that Dock icon, which I was nowhere near.

It's gotten to the point where anything I do never functions as expected.  Are they actually going to fix the problems with it or is Mac gaming doomed to die?  Steam was really the big shot Mac had at gaming and I'm hoping they don't drop the ball.

Just in case anyone is looking to play Black Mesa, I followed a guide and got it working perfectly on my integrated Intel graphics card.  I followed a guide from [here](http://forums.blackmesasource.com/archive/index.php?t-12746.html).  I've tried Crossover and had huge engine crashes, but this works perfectly.  Framerate is good too with mostly High settings.

1. install WineSkin from http://wineskin.urgesoftware.com and open WineSkin Winery
(remember to update the WineSkin wrapper when you first open it)
2. click ""+"", select the latest ""CXG"" from the drop down list, ""Download and Install"". I used ""WS8WineCXG10.3.0"", but feel free to experiment.
3. from ""Installed Engines"" select the one you just installed, click ""Create New Blank Wrapper""
4. pick a name e.g. SteamWine, click OK, wait a bit, view wrapper in Finder (I'm assuming it's going to be ~/Applications/SteamWine.app)
5. open SteamWine.app, click ""Choose Setup Executable"", browse to SteamInstall.msi, click thru install
6. advanced -&gt; tools -&gt; Winetricks and install the following:
d3dx9,
d3dcompiler_43,
d3dxof,
d3dx9_43,
vcrun2005,
win7,
vsm=hardware,
orm=fbo,
psm=enabled,
ddr=gdi,
OPTIONAL: Enable Multisampling

It turns out you can change the cursor size in OSX under System Preferences → Accessibility, and it scales the in-game cursor as well! The other settings there also worked for me in LoL, so they may be useful.

Questions 1-4: Windows games.

Questions 5-8: Drivers and peripherals/Specific Troubleshooting.

Questions 9-14: General Troubleshooting.

Question 15: Emulators.

Question 16-17: Why NOT to use Mac.

Question 18: I still have a general question

Question 19: Hey, I'm a pirate.

Question 20: Mountain Lion.

Question 21-22: Steam.

Q1. I want to play a Windows game. Should I use Boot Camp, Virtualization (i.e. VMWare), Wine(skin), CrossOver, or Cider?

A. If you don't like beta software, Boot Camp is your only safe bet. Virtualization is okay if you want to play Peggle, but you may or may not have trouble playing games that require more resources (hardware specifications define the performance). The rest of your answer largely depends on who's available to assist you as far as Wine(skin), CrossOver, and Cider goes. (Hint: Standard, GUI-less Wine can be painful.) **First, check the [AppDB](http://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=application&amp;sTitle=Browse%20Applications&amp;sOrderBy=appName&amp;bAscending=true) or [C4](http://www.codeweavers.com/compatibility/).** If your game is there and listed under Gold or Platinum, great! The page should tell you how to get it running. ([Winetricks info](http://wineskin.urgesoftware.com/tiki-index.php?page=Manual+4.5+Advanced+-+Tools)) If not, check www.portingteam.com for a Cider or Wineskin wrapper. You could also try porting it yourself, but be prepared for a headache. (Hint: DirectX10+, .NET 3.0+, and proprietary libraries are generally big no-no's.)

Q2. What the hell is Wine?

A. Wine stands for Wine Is Not an Emulator. It's an open source (anyone can change it) API layer (change Windows functions to Mac functions). In other words, if there is a function in Windows called draw_pretty_picture(int), Wine tries to re-create draw_pretty_picture(int) so that Windows applications can call draw_pretty_picture(int) in UNIX environments. To do this, it may use the Mac OS X function DrawWeirdThing(int). (If that hurts your head, all you really need to know is that Wine can't run malware, Wine is not malware, and I may have explained that incorrectly.)

Q3. What the hell is CrossOver?

A. CrossOver is pre-patched Wine in a consumer-friendly package. Pros over Wineskin: Pre-patched, professional support, only one 106MB engine installed. Cons below Wineskin: Only one engine option available, annoying Winetricks usage.

Q4. What the hell is Cider?

A. Cider is TransGaming's proprietary fork of WineX. (That's a fancy way of saying, TransGaming stole code from Wine to make a version of Wine that is only meant to play a specific DirectX game.) Pros over Wineskin: 
Extremely fast, native GUI (does not use Windows alerts). Cons below Wineskin: Extremely low compatibility, annoying to set up.

Q5. I have a Hackintosh. Does this sub-reddit still apply to me?

A. Yes. Next question, please.

Q6. I want to use a gamepad, or I have a gamepad. HALP!

A. Try [this - free](http://abstractable.net/enjoy/) or [this - $8](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/gamepad-companion/id428799479?mt=12). If those don't work, Google on, young Padawan.

Q7. Should I upgrade my hardware? Insert problem here.

A. If, by ""upgrade my hardware"", you mean, ""purchase a new device"" (Hackintoshes and Mac Pros exempt, obviously), that really depends on how badly you want the game running. You should, while the game is running, check Activity Monitor. If don't have plenty (256MB-ish) of free RAM, upgrade that. (On some of the newer devices, even the RAM is soldered in.) Otherwise, you are screwed, since the processor and graphics card are soldered in.

Q8. Should I update my graphics drivers? Insert problem here.

A. (These links are subject to change.) If you are NOT on a Hackintosh OR a Mac Pro, then updating the operating system will also update the graphics drivers. Otherwise, consult your local forum/manual, or [NVIDIA - Mac Pros/Hackintoshes](http://www.nvidia.com/object/macosx-270.00.00f06-driver.html) or [ATI - Mac Pros/Hackintoshes](http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/Pages/index.aspx).

Q9. So none of that helped. The game is still running slowly, or is crash-happy.

A. QuOFRRS. (Pronounced like, kwafers.) Quit other applications, ""Other/Visual"" settings in-game may need to be lowered, Full-Screen the game, Resolution may need to be lowered, Reboot, System requirements.

Q10. So none of that helped. The game is still running slowly, or is crash-happy.

A. Good God. Contact the developers, purchase a new machine, or see Question 1.

Q11. My laptop is getting very hot/screams loudly, at any given time.

A. This may not be a game related issue. This is likely an mds (Spotlight indexer) issue. [How to.](http://osxdaily.com/2011/12/10/disable-or-enable-spotlight-in-mac-os-x-lion/)

Q12. My laptop is getting very hot/screams loudly, after launching a game.

A. Depending on the game, this may or may not be normal. This is always normal for a ported game (Wineskin/Cider). This is also normal for, say, Borderlands (Unreal Engine 3/high resources) but not normal for, say, Peggle (casual game). Check Activity Monitor for a process that is using more than 50% CPU that is not the game.

Q13. My laptop stays very hot/screams loudly, after quitting a game.

A. First, give it a couple minutes, for crying out loud. Second, see Q12, and also double-check to see if the game ""actually quit."" (Check the Dock. Is the funny blue light still under the game? For a port, do Wine processes still appear in the Activity Monitor?)

Q14.

Q15. Emulators?

A. Sidebar. If you know of one that isn't listed, PM me and/or the mods.

Q16. Why Windows over Mac OS X?

A. There are more games, and the games run natively. There isn't much more to add then that.

Q17. Why Linux over Mac OS X?

A. The only real reason is better Wine support. (Mac OS X generally has a better *native* game selection than Linux.) There are more users in public forums who can write a Wine patch for Wine running on a Linux system than Wine running on a Mac OS X system. (More choices for audio drivers, different support in some areas, etc. (For example, Rage runs in Wine on Linux systems, but not in Wine on Mac OS X Systems, as of June 2012.)) 

Q18. What if I need more specific help?

A. Post your problem, and your system specifications. ""MacBook Pro 2011"" doesn't tell us anything. ""Intel i7 4*3.40GHz + NVIDIA 330M@512MB + 8GB RAM and error message ""could not initialize renderer"" "" is better.

Q19. What if I'm a pirate?

A. Whatever. You only really need to follow two general rules: don't help anyone else pirate, and if you need help, make sure that we know that you did pirate the application/game. Failing to do so may result in a ban.

Q20. Is Mountain Lion okay?

A. It breaks parts of Wine. Do not update for now if you use any form of Wine. Otherwise, you should be fine.

Q21. Steam keeps crashing!

A. [This works.](http://www.reddit.com/r/macgaming/comments/146dui/i_figured_out_how_to_make_steam_on_mac_run_faster/). And I have no idea why. Just trust it.

Q21. I keep getting disconnected/crashed/unauthorized/logged out/ripped apart by Steam.

Good frame rate, no crashes, everything works how it's supposed to, and I am here to share that success with those of you who have not gotten it working, or have a less stable version. it does have a 12.4 GB final install size, so be ready for that. Without further ado:

1) Download Wineskin (http://wineskin.urgesoftware.com/tiki-index.php?page=Downloads)
    Download Steam Installer for PC (http://cdn.steampowered.com/download/SteamInstall.msi)
    Download Black Mesa (http://www.blackmesasource.com/download.html)

2) Open Wineskin Winery click the ""+"".  In the drop down menu select ""WS8WineCXG 10.3.0"". Click ""Download and Install""

3) Highlight ""WS8WineCXG 10.3.0"" and click ""Create New Blank Wrapper"" name it ""Black Mesa"". When the new wrapper is complete click ""View in Finder"" and open it up.

4) In the Black Mesa app click Advanced, click the Tools tab in there, click Winetricks.

5) In Winetricks go into .dlls tab and select ""d3dx9"", ""d3dcompiler_43"", and ""d3dxof"", also go into the Settings tab and select ""Multisampling = Enabled"". Click Run (5-10min process).

6) Go back to the main menu on your Black Mesa app.  From there click Install Software and select the steam.msi installer.  Once installed log into steam, and then quit steam.

7) Go into your Black Mesa app and click Advanced again.  Click Install Software and select the Black Mesa installer.

8) After installation launch Steam, it will need to download Source SDK 2007, and 2006.  This took about 45 min for me, about 6GB total to download at this point.

After downloading the SDK's it should be ready to play, but a couple of additional notes:

9) In your Black Mesa app that you created go into Advanced and make sure that your Windows .EXE window has ""/Program Files/Steam/Steam.exe"" listed as the path.

10) Underneath the Windows .EXE window you should see another window for EXE Flags if you copy and paste within the parentheses (-applaunch 218 -game ""..\..\SourceMods\BMS"") in that window it will bypass opening Steam for the file, basically save you some clicking.  EDIT: In the parentheses in the quotes it is supposed to show dot dot backslash dot dot backslash, for some reason the first backslash does not show up.

Now at this point I ran into some problems that both mac and pc users have reported, in that the menu goes white within black mesa, and when hit by an enemy or near radiation the screen would go pitch black.  This makes the game unplayable, but I have found a workaround on that as well.  If you go into the options and click the Black Mesa tab you should find both ""Enable Chromatic Aberration"" and ""Enable Noise Shaders"" are both checked.  Disable both of these options and the black out issues are no more.

There you go, my complete guide to setting up a crash free version of Black Mesa on the mac.  I had never used Wineskin before so I thought I would share my newfound ""expertise"" with some of you who might have no idea how to use it.  Black Mesa is awesome, I personally enjoy it more than the original Half-Life (which as I understand was FINALLY released for mac today on Steam).

Also get yourself a snazzy icon for your Black Mesa app, I found several good ones on google images by searching ""Black Mesa Icon.""

In closing I would like to reiterate, I did almost none of this on my own.  I went to several forums and used other peoples' methods, I simply tried to dumb it down for those of us who don't have much knowledge of wineskin, and combined a few different methods.  So I would like to thank of course, the Black Mesa team, Skitch and DarkSynergy over at the Black Mesa forum, and especially Tetsu over at the Porting Team forums.  Those are the people who really made this guide.

EDIT 3/18/13: In the past few weeks there has been a problem with Steam updating in Wine, in that it goes into an infinite loop.  This has been a pain in the neck, I posted a simple workaround in the comments below (Oculo_Dextro's comment), however yesterday I came up with a more permanent solution which is also a pain in the neck, but I thought I would share it nonetheless.  The update loop problem has been fixed in the latest version of Wine (open up Wineskin Winery and update it then go to ""+ New Engine Available"" and download ""WS9Wine 1.5.25"").  This new engine will fix the infinite loop issue, however it will not run Black Mesa properly.  Solution: use both.  I opened up both of my wrappers (Black Mesa and this new 1.5.25 Wrapper), using ctrl-click&gt;Show Package Contents&gt;Drive_c&gt;Program Files.  In Program Files there is a Steam folder, I simply moved that file from Black Mesa Wrapper into the Program Files of the 1.5.25 Wrapper.  Then I ran that wrapper, let Steam update, then moved the files back into the Black Mesa Wrapper.

It works fine now, no more issues so far.  I'm not sure if future updates of Steam will need to be run through the new wrapper, or if the loop was only for that one particular update of Steam, but I'll update this in the future if need be.

There are lots of options to get these games working, such as [Wineskin](http://wineskin.doh123.com/), [Crossover](http://www.codeweavers.com/), [Bootcamp](http://www.apple.com/support/bootcamp/), or even virtualization software like [Parallels](http://www.parallels.com/), [VMware Fusion](http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion/overview.html) or [VirtualBox](http://www.virtualbox.org/) for games that don't demand a lot of resources. 

However, another option for several games is to use a [source port](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_port), which is basically a port of the game engine to newer operating systems. You still need the original game data files for a source port work.

Here are some source ports I've had success running:

* For the original Quake, I use [ezQuake](http://ezquake.sourceforge.net/) or [DarkPlaces](http://icculus.org/twilight/darkplaces/index.html). Both are easy to set up and provide good support for OS X, and stay relatively true to the original game (DarkPlaces uses some fancier lighting).
* For Duke Nukem 3D, I use [EDuke32](http://www.spam-filter.de/osx/eduke32_on_os_x), which has been updated several times over the past few months. You can substitute in high-resolution graphics, but I'd rather stick with the original look.
* For Quake 2, there's a [Quake II source port](http://www.fruitz-of-dojo.de/php/download.php4), which has a front end very similar to ezQuake.
* For Doom, I like [Doomsday Engine](http://dengine.net/).
* For Descent and Descent 2, [DXX-Rebirth](http://www.dxx-rebirth.com/) is great.
* I suppose [Aleph One](http://source.bungie.org/) is a source port of the Marathon games, and since Bungie released the Marathon games for free, you can play these ones at no cost.

Anyway, I thought I'd share a few links for anyone with these old games collecting dust.",,False,self,t5_2rk3e,False,,,True,t3_sx0sn,http://www.reddit.com/r/macgaming/comments/sx0sn/a_few_fps_source_ports/,

1330270481.0,22,self.macgaming,q6qrb,iD's RAGE on Mac: beyond expectations,30,8,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/macgaming/comments/q6qrb/ids_rage_on_mac_beyond_expectations/,"I got back into gaming about a year ago and played the top AAA titles available on the Mac and was a bit letdown: Half-Life 2 and Bioshock were great games but the story was less than I was hyped to expect, Borderlands was a dull shooter with endless inventory management and pointless RPG levelling tacked on, the Force Unleashed is a lousy QTE-driven snoreville, and Batman Arkham Asylum has great stealth missions but the worst boss fights I've ever seen. Of course Portal and Portal 2 were fantastic.

And they all looked very nice. But then I played RAGE. Holy crap.

RAGE was savaged by the public: at Metacritic, professional reviewers' aggregate score is 79, but users gave it a scorching 4.4 points, which was well-deserved because of launch issues like texture pop-in and crashiness. id made it worse by accepting none of the blame and pushing it all on AMD and NVidia drivers. But they pushed out updates and texture pop-in complaints were resolved.

Aspyr published the port for RAGE, which scared the crap outta me. Their port of The Force Unleashed was a nightmarish hellspawn like I never expected. But I just had to see RAGE for myself.

Ars Technica gave RAGE the harshest review I'd even seen for a game: ""an airless, inert experience, unsatisfying gunfights, Borderlands with the fun stripped out,"" etc. Ben Kuchera also tells a few lies about the game, like ""You go from realizing everyone you love is dead to shooting bad guys in about 30 seconds,"" which is false, and a several other exaggerations and pointless complaints.

He made some good points too, like the old-school save game system. It's actually worse than that, because the game is prone to corrupting its own save game database. This happened to me three times, meaning I lost my progress in a level but was kicked back to the beginning of the mission.

My thought: play that awesome mission again? Fine by me! I eventually stopped saving altogether and just relied on the built-in checkpoint system. That meant no saving during missions, which was fine by me.

There are three utterly amazing things about this game:

1. The combat is top-shelf amazing. All the weapons are fun to use, all the enemies are fun to fight, the environments are fun to fight in.

2. The game is stunning to look at. The game has no detail textures because of the ""megatexture"" tech that id used to build the game, so objects up close look blurry, but the trade-off is: hand-painted detail everywhere, and extremely high geometry modelling of the environments. I was often completely gobsmacked by how intricate, enormous, and beautiful the environments were. Character animations were awesome too.

3. The ""inventory system"" that I normally hate in games was completely painless in RAGE. Crafting items was fun, and the things you could build like remote controlled bomb cars and ""pop rockets"" that turn your shotgun into a grenade launcher were all clever and unusual. Most importantly, it didn't feel like work, it didn't slow down the game, it wasn't hard to understand, and I didn't need to look up a wiki to learn it.

I do have some game design complaints:

1. The final mission was the worst in the whole game, with ""monster closets"" that made me think id was making fun of the player. And I was saving the ammo for the super-minigun I was just given for this mission, expecting a big boss fight, but there was none, just endless waves of goons and mutants. Playing the final mission a second time using the mini gun was a total cakewalk. Did they plan to have a big boss, and dropped it during development? Because that's how it feels. The environment is also dull and repetitive. 

2. There are immersion-breaking moments everywhere. For instance, if you picked a side-mission from the job board or the postal service, the game would just ""teleport"" you to the mission location, and ""teleport"" you back when it was over, and would ""magically"" give you the money for completing the mission without interacting with someone. Basically, none the main missions functioned like that, so you had to travel to your mission then come back to pick up the reward. It made the side-missions feel extremely tacked on and unpolished. The ""sewer missions"" also felt very tacked on, so if you buy used for 360 or PS3, you aren't missing much, since the sewer missions require an unlock code on those platforms.

3. I wish the game didn't end after the final mission. I would like to have gone back to the hub towns, talked to the townsfolk like Dan Hagar (who disappears in the middle of the game for no reason and never comes back), played some more mini-games and races, and wander the Wasteland for bandits and stranded Authority goons. BTW, there should have been free-roaming mutants in the Wasteland, which otherwise feels too empty and too safe. 

I recommend this game to everyone who likes shooters.

BTW, while everyone likes to compare RAGE with Borderlands, it feels a lot closer to Half-Life 2: corridor shooter, excellent character animation, post-apocalyptic environment, unusual signature weapon, Authority vs Resistance, long vehicle sections, and really similar weapons load-outs, including a peculiar crossbow and the ""special Authority assault rifle"" that no one else uses.",,False,self,t5_2rk3e,False,,,True,t3_q6qrb,http://www.reddit.com/r/macgaming/comments/q6qrb/ids_rage_on_mac_beyond_expectations/,

However, when it hit $20 on Steam I bought it and have to say I've been pleasantly surprised so far. It's not a bad game at all. And my God it hasn't crashed once yet. Not once.

It's also a huge game.

There is some attention to detail that is new. Horseback ridding isn't just aswd and go. Your horse has to turn around. If you push it too hard it gets tired. And you can't take it everywhere.

If you buy it and play mage: get summoning as one of your first spells. Mages are squishy and at first, the cards you need to buff your spells are hard to come by.

Yes it's true that the dialog is a little cheesy. But it's all voice acted and, honestly, it's good enough.

Finally, it has multiplayer capabilities but I haven't explored them at all.

It's no Oblivion, but it's really probably the best 3D RPG to come to OSX that I've seen.

Honestly, its biggest Achilles heel is getting compared to Oblivion all the time. But for a mac owner, it is a great game to bring to your Mac.

8/10 over all 7/10 for magic 8.5/10 for world and design. Horse back ridding isn't perfect, but for a mouse user it's quite fun. Ignore the console complainers.

After playing to the final encounter, I've discovered that my toon as a mage is not allowed to shoot spells at the boss to win. Instead he has to painfully use ballistas while taking massive amounts of fire damage that my fire protection potion does nothing to mitigate.

Revised score: **magic system 6 (does not rise to its potential).  Game 7. World design 7 (outside world is really nicely done. Dungeon design is lackluster)**

The world was great for the first and second continent. The third and apparently largest continent however has nothing on it to explore instead you visit two little spots and then fight the last boss.

Unfortunately I have to conclude that this game was published before being finished.  That's too bad really, I really enjoyed the first two continents.

Wait for a bargain bin offering. It's still a great game for the Mac, just one that fails to live up to some of the excellent potential built into it.",,False,self,t5_2rk3e,True,,,True,t3_ijm48,http://www.reddit.com/r/macgaming/comments/ijm48/two_worlds_on_osx/,

Here are the steps:

1. Download the latest version of EDuke32 [here](http://www.spam-filter.de/_media/osx/eduke32/eduke32_osx_20110315.dmg)

2. Download the [Hi-Res Pack zip file](http://www.duke4.org/files/nightfright/polymer/polymer_hrp.zip), the [Maphacks zip file](http://www.duke4.org/files/nightfright/polymer/polymer_mhk.zip), and the [XXX Pack zip file](http://www.duke4.org/files/nightfright/xxx_pack.zip) (optional, but recommended). **Leave the folders zipped.**

3. Download the duke3d.grp and duke.rts files. You can obtain them by purchasing a copy of [Duke Nukem 3D on gog.com for $5.99](http://www.gog.com/en/gamecard/duke_nukem_3d_atomic_edition), or you can download those files [here](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/21084567/Duke3DFiles.zip) (be sure to unzip these ones).

4. In  ""~/Library/Application Support"", create a new folder labeled EDuke32. Alternately, you can just run the eduke32 application and the folder will be created automatically. Put the duke3d.grp and duke.rts files (obtained in step 3) inside the EDuke32 folder. 

5. Within the EDuke32 folder, create another folder titled **autoload**. Within the **autoload folder**, create another folder titled **duke3d.grp**. Open up the newly created duke3d.grp folder, and place the zip files obtained in step 2 here. Remember to make sure these files are still zipped.

6. Run the game if you haven't already, then quit out of it. Go back to the EDuke32 folder in ""~/Library/Application Support"" and open up a file titled eduke32.cfg in text edit. On the line that says **NoAutoLoad = 1**, change it to **NoAutoLoad = 0**, then save the file.

7. When you start the game again, if you are having sound problems, go into the option menu in the game, and under audio, change the sound from 16 bit to 8 bit, then restart the sound system. This should fix any problems with the audio.

8. (Optional) While still in the eduke32.cfg file, on the line that says **Polymer = 0**, change it to **Polymer = 1**, then save the file. This causes the game to use the Polymer renderer. While the Polymer renderer will enhance the graphics quite a bit, but may also cause the game to slow down. If you do enable Polymer and are experiencing problems, open the eduke32.cfg file once again, change it back to **Polymer = 0** to disable it, then save the file again.

I'd understand if we couldn't play Online together (since one uses Steam and the other Game Center) but not even being able to create a LAN game?! Whats with that? As a consumer, we shouldn't have to worry about the same titled game being incompatible with other players because of the retailer... 

I contacted Gearbox about the issue and got this in reply:

&gt; Hi,

&gt; Thanks for writing in.

&gt; Please contact Aspyr for technical support regarding the Mac version of Borderlands 2.

&gt; You can reach Aspyr support at http://support.aspyr.com/home

&gt; You can also find a list of known issues, as well as the latest news on updates, in our Knowledge Base: (support.gearboxsoftware.com)

&gt; Justin

Then I contacted Aspyr and got basically no help:

&gt; Aspyr Technical Support, Jun 04 11:41 am (CDT):

&gt; The App Store release of Borderlands 2 (1.3.3) utilizes Game Center and not Steam for co-op multiplayer while the Steam version (1.5.0) utilizes Steam.

&gt; To request a refund, please contact App Store customer service directly.

If you want help running your favorite Windows-only game on your Mac (without using that virtual machine stuff) shoot me a message (or reply to this topic) with the name of the game and a way to purchase the game online and I'll see if I can help you out. I will make you either a Wineskin wrapper or a Cider wrapper, but I will never provide a nocd exe with the wrapper. (If *I cannot pirate the game* and *do not already own it* and *am not interested in playing the game*, I will ask you to pay for it.) (I will tell you if you need a nocd exe, however.) Remember to check The Porting Team first.

As a warning (thanks to ""badloop"" on reddit for reminding me) that many Wineskin AND cider wrappers do not function well/properly/at all on ATI cards. As a secondary warning, I can't guarantee that I can port any given game, I can only guarantee that I will try (time allowing).

Also, I'm definitely not the only one who can do this. Feel free to help others in this thread if you are a porter.

You CAN request a full game download. (Have the game included in the wrapper. A nocd exe WILL be included.) You will be given the download links privately, but you must pay for the game/bandwidth in advance. (PM me for more details.)

It's also normally better to post in The Porting Team Forums, but, well, *shrug*.

For a few months now I've been emulating old mac classics and recording demos of them for my [YouTube channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/Mackinstyle?feature=guide). I'm doing this because I know how awesome that hit of nostalgia can be when you see a game from your childhood.  I also know how hard it is to emulate some games smoothly and properly.  I've taken it upon myself to slowly make the biggest collection nostalgic videos of mac games (generally from the 90s), and would like to get the word out.


Please note that I am not AdSensing or trying to make money in any way. It's purely for the love of retro mac gaming!  So won't you please check it out and have a burst of nostalgia today?  I'm also taking requests of what to do next!

I loved Portal, not super into fantasy type stuff (obviously some sci-fi is okay since I liked Portal), FPS is okay though not ideal, sports would be good. Also, sorry if this post is annoying, or if you get them often, I would just rather get recommendations from real people rather than reading a million reviews since I don't really know where to start.

Seeing as some of you have already pre-loaded it on Steam, maybe I could get the specifics on that. 

Also, I'm not a fan of torrenting so I'm considering grabbing Infinite now on the digital store on Steam or GMG to get the bonus content and games (XCOM, Bioshock 1, Bioshock 2). I only have until later today to finalize that decision until the deal is gone. So, to those experienced Steam users, would it be worth it to put down the $60 now to get the offers and just download it all when I have computer, or just wait to buy it until I have a MacBook?

Today, I'll speak to you about the three major routes to take when talking about using a controller on a Mac.  Let's get this out of the way first: they all have similar buttons and layouts.  They all have their own pros and cons.  These will benefit you ONLY if you're choosing to have four controllers(or more than one, anyway).


*Route 1: Dualshock 3(One: $25-$45, Four: $100-$180)* 

This method is awesome, because unlike the other two, I can recommend this one for a single user.  If you ONLY want a controller for yourself, and will ONLY be playing on Mac OS, this is the controller for you.  From 10.6 and up, the Dualshock 3 will work wirelessly, without any additional software.  You can have anywhere between 1 and 4 controllers connected through bluetooth.  This will NOT be an ideal method if you want to run on Windows, because there is no feasible(or simple) way of making them work wirelessly on Windows.  If you're comfortable with having four controllers plugged in though, be my guest. 


*Route 2: Logitech F710($110 for 4 controllers)*

The new one comes with a wireless dongle, used generally do not.  Up to four can be used at a time.  This controller is supported by both Windows and OSX, in both Direct Input mode and X-Input.

You can purchase used controllers [here](http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=261173624627), and the dongle [here](http://buy.logitech.com/store/logib2c/en_US/DisplayCategoryProductListPage/categoryid.57042900?resid=USp5TgoBAlgAAFades8AAABY&amp;rests=1361738062416).


*Route 3: XBOX 360 Controllers(Four controllers &amp; Dongle: $100-$155)*

Heres the method I finally decided on using.  It's the most compatible, and the most ubiquitous.  I tried the F710 for a while, but it wasn't for me.  Purchase [this](http://www.amazon.com/Xbox-360-Wireless-Gaming-Receiver-Windows/dp/B000HZFCT2/ref=sr_1_cc_3?s=aps&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1361738772&amp;sr=1-3-catcorr&amp;keywords=windows+xbox+dongle).  Then all wireless 360 controllers will work on your Mac(after you install a driver by tattiebogle), and will of course work natively with Windows.

Enjoy ;)

I really liked the expansion, I had never played it thru before, my only complaint is once you get to a certain point its main quest only, no more side quests, and no more gear purchasing. I'm thinking I'll give it a second play-through at some point with a different character. I did this one as a dual-wielding dwarven rogue.

Thanks so much everyone for making this an awesome experience. Hope everyone has a safe and fun new year!

**Original**: Hi r/macgaming, one of the Arcen Games guys here. To celebrate our involvement in Steam's Holiday Sale and Gift Pile Treasure Hunt we're stopping by some of our favorite medium-sized gaming subreddits to run a few giveaways of our games now through December 31st. All of the games we'll be raffling off are available on OS X for the record. :)

What we'll be giving away, and where you can get it if you don't win it:

**Steam Titles**

You can grab our deep space strategy title [AI War](http://store.steampowered.com/app/40400) and any/all of its DLC for 75% off through December 31st (even more savings if you go with the Alien Bundle which is everything together.) Not only that but it has a featured achievement Steam users can unlock to earn and win more stuff through the current [The Great Gift Pile treasure hunt event](http://store.steampowered.com/holidaysale) running in conjunction with the huge sale.

Our unique puzzler [Tidalis](http://store.steampowered.com/app/40420/) is 80% off on Steam as well. If you're into deep block-based puzzling (note: not match-3) for $2 instead of $10, make sure to take advantage of the hefty discount.

**Non-Steam Titles**

Our in-development sprawling 2D sidescroller [A Valley Without Wind](http://www.arcengames.com/w/index.php/avww-buy) is available for pre-order now through our site at 50% off the launch price (at the moment it's $10 as opposed to $20.)  You can also grab it on MacGamesStore, Impulse, and GamersGate. Currently in public beta the game is not yet available on Steam, but if/when it does arrive the licence key you'll receive will work to activate the game on Valve's client.


If you'd like to try any of these games you can find the AI War demo [here](http://www.arcengames.com/w/index.php/aiwar-downloads), Tidalis demo [here](http://www.arcengames.com/w/index.php/tidalis-downloads), and AVWW demo [here](http://www.arcengames.com/w/index.php/avww-downloads). The AI War and Tidalis demos are also available through Steam, though I believe that those are just the PC versions.

How you can participate in the giveaway:


Per request I'll be giving out the keys by asking in the comments for a number between such and such, so I can use a RNG to pick a winner. If the winning number has been selected by more than one person than I'll renumber those who picked right and roll again. If no one picked the number that comes up, I'll find the number closet to--and you can go over (not PiR rules.) The threads are open until I edit the original post saying differently. I'll close them sometime in the next day or so, figure out the winners, and deliver the licence keys to their inboxes.


We'll be adding extra keys to the drawing as we reach various milestones in upvotes, points, and participants to add some incentive for those participating to upvote and get everyone here involved. Basically, as this post accumulates more points and entries, I'll add in extra keys and draw additional winners for them accordingly.


If you do end up picking up [AI War](http://reddit.com/r/aiwar) or [A Valley Without Wind](http://reddit.com/r/avww) during the sale/giveaway, consider checking out their respective subreddits for regular updates and discussion.


Thanks everyone and best of luck! Happy Holidays. :D

Love,

[Arcen Games](http://twitter.com/arcengames)

**Edit**: An amendment to the rules above as wisely suggested by Reddit user cyantist. The reasoning is good enough for me:

*I want to encourage you to run the random number generator until you get a hit, rather than find the closest number submission. Shouldn't everyone get an equal chance? If 3 people choose 13, 14, 15 for a chance to win AI War, why then should 14 get a 1/81 chance of winning and 13 and 15 have more than that?*

*Why should people who post later get better chances? (Due to the fact that they can choose numbers relative to those who have already posted.)*",,False,self,t5_2rk3e,True,,flair2,True,t3_nl0qf,http://www.reddit.com/r/macgaming/comments/nl0qf/running_a_few_game_giveaways_to_celebrate_our/,

SMAC is one of the most critically acclaimed Sid Meier games around and I've been itching to play it after reading everything Reddit has to say about it.

I'm working with the .exe installer I purchased from GoG.com, available for only $2.99 for the next few days, I don't know if this will work for the CD version as I know GoG tweak their games slightly to work with modern computers. [[Link]](http://www.gog.com/gamecard/sid_meiers_alpha_centauri).

Codeweavers Crossover is a fantastic app that I use almost every day to avoid having to reboot into Bootcamp, well worth the $59 they ask (cheaper than a new copy of Win7 for Bootcamp), and I'm using version 12.0, released earlier this month. [[Link]](http://www.codeweavers.com/products/)

I'm also using Mac OS 10,7,5 and a mid-2009 Macbook Pro.

First step is to do the basic install. Pick ""other application"" from the menu of available choices, select the file ""setup_sid_meiers_alpha_centauri_2.0.0.19.exe"" as the installer file, and a new Windows XP installer bottle. [[Screenshot]](http://i.imgur.com/RoaK2.png).

Once that's done, some people are reporting that the game just plays for them. If it does, that's great, but for me it wasn't working. 

Go back to Crossover, and select Configure&gt;Manage Bottles from the menu. From the window that pops up, select the Advanced tab, and then press the ""Open C: Drive in Finder"" button. [[Screenshot]](http://i.imgur.com/PdKVL.png?1)

From the window it opens, select GOG Games&gt;Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri&gt;Alpha Centauri.Ini and open that file in TextEdit. Make sure the following lines are present in the file

     ForceOldVoxelAlgorithm=1
     DisableOpeningMovie=1
     DirectDraw=0

Save the file and close it. From there, go to the Control Panel tab, and select Wine Configuration, and click Launch Selected Item. [[Screenshot]](http://i.imgur.com/elUMX.png)

From the Wine Configuration menu, in the default tab change the Windows Version to Windows 98. [[Screenshot]](http://i.imgur.com/Ec7xO.png)

I'm not sure if it works for all notebooks, or even all Macs, but it works with my MacBook Pro 6,1 (2010, core i7)

The only problem I came across (when I was still having problems) was that StarCraft would crash and freeze. I would then have to hard-reboot my notebook. 

I found that if I change my video card settings with gfxCardStatus from the Dedicated NVidea Geforce GT 330m to the integrated Intel only the crashing would stop. 

TL;DR - Using Intel only videocard settings with gfxCardStatus stops Starcraft 1 from crashing.

It's resolution settings max out at 1080p, but there is a note on the settings screen saying that it is rendered at the selected resolution (1080p) and then scaled up to screen native size.


Mouse input is kinda buggy. First of all, it is laggy. I make a mouse movement, and there is a slight delay before the curser makes the same movement. I didn't see this problem the 2nd time I opened big picture mode (to test my game pad [bellow]) and I don't think I had that problem in VMWare. Second, If the curser exits the main screen and goes to my wing monitor, the curser completely disappears until I click. Even if I mouse it back onto the steam screen.

My gamepad (a hand-me-down AxisPad) is also a little funky in steam. Then again, it's a little funky in most games too. Steams problems are numerous: 

* The primary buttons are in an unexpected order. The buttons are numbered 1 through 4 at left, up, down, right. Steam works with buttons A and B which map to buttons 1 and 2, and I couldn't find a way to map them to put logical A and B on button 3 and 4 where they belong. 
* The shoulder buttons are buttons 5-7, and didn't seem to be mapped to anything in steam. Steam has controls labeled for the shoulder buttons, but I couldn't get them to invoke. 
* I couldn't get steam to invoke it's D-Pad controls. My controller has a ""mode"" button that switches left stick behavior between the left stick and the D-Pad. When the left stick is active, the D-Pad didn't seem to do anything, let alone invoke the steam D-Pad buttons.
* I couldn't find a way inside steam to let me map the buttons on the controller. I'm sure if this option was somewhere, many of these problems would go away.

I'll have to try again with a more modern/better supported game pad, and/or some driver kludge to let me remap the AxisPad, which I have done in the past to make it work with certain games.

It is a MESS!

I have recently seen people with the 13"" MacBook Pros lamenting their lack of a ""real"" video card, and understand their strife.  I'm kinda pissed that my x1600 chip, while technically shader 3 compliant, is only so when in BootCamp (wtf?).

I know that Macs, especially laptops, aren't made to be gaming rigs, but that doesn't mean that they can't still be good enough at it.  But, which ones are, and which ones aren't?  [This page](http://www.videocardbenchmark.net/gpu_list.php) has been a big help in comparing basic ""power"" of the chips, but it is way too large, and not mac-specific.

For those shopping for a second-hand Mac, I think a resource like this would be invaluable.  I'm envisioning a chart, over time, with Mac models and their associated cards being color-coded as ""crap"" (GMA 950, x3100, x1600), ""poor"" (3000, 4000), ""borderline"" (9600M GT, HD 4670), ""Good"" (4870, 8800GT), or ""Great"" (6770M, HD 5770).

Yeah, I'm sure my examples are far from perfect, but is this something someone could take a stab at?  I think it could help a lot of people at a minimum, and perhaps even help steer the future of Mac gaming in general.

Thanks for your consideration!  Back to playing SC II on my x1600 MBP.

**TL;DR:  Someone make a friggin' helpful chart!**

Everybody probably knows this, but here are some classic DOS RPGs that have been released for free and run via [Boxer](http://boxerapp.com/):

* [The Elder Scrolls: Arena](http://www.elderscrolls.com/arena/). This install is a bit of a pain, since the .exe file is actually a Windows program, meaning you have to run it from Windows, then copy the folder to Boxer to run as a Mac app.
* [The Elder Scrolls: Daggerfall](http://www.elderscrolls.com/daggerfall/). This one is easier, just unzip the file from this link and then import the entire folder to Boxer. Once you've gone through the install process, you need to apply the latest patch manually. To do that, Show Package Contents for your new Boxer/Daggerfall app, copy from D DFInstall.cdrom/DAGGER/DAG213.EXE  to C.harddisk/DAGGER, then double-click it.
* [Ultima IV](http://boxerapp.com/games). Downloadable right from the Boxer website. Othewise, you can download from [GOG](http://www.gog.com/en/gamecard/ultima_4) but then you have to find a way to run the Windows installer, then copy the install files, like Arena above.",,False,self,t5_2rk3e,False,,,True,t3_qdxq2,http://www.reddit.com/r/macgaming/comments/qdxq2/a_few_dos_rpgs_that_work_well_in_boxer/,

Is there any truth to this?

They do offer a lot of DLC though, which I don't like. But the game is still very entertaining, and has a pretty good community following, including mods and buying/selling of items.

Download the wrapper on the [portingteam page](http://portingteam.com/files/file/7181-planescape-torment/page__st__45). 

Then right click on it -&gt; show package contents

Run Wineskin go to advanced -&gt; tools -&gt; Config Utility(winecfg) -&gt; Windows Version(dropdown) has to be at least winxp

Back in Advanced -&gt; Tools choose update Wrapper

After that choose install software -&gt; choose setup executable and use your Planescape Torment Exe from [good old games](http://www.gog.com/gamecard/planescape_torment)

The installer will hang at a certain point, just make sure you wait long enough(I worked in the meantime so I let it stay at that point for around an hour). Then I quit the process with right click on the dock menu and choose quit there. The game runs fine.

If you have problems or the application asks for X11 search for XQuartz that's what I use.

**Edit1:** If you want to change from fullscreen to window open up the wineskin again, go to Screen Options set settings to override choose virtual desktop at: &lt;preferred resolution&gt;

**Edit2:** If you want to use mods, here is a [modding guide](http://thunderpeel2001.blogspot.de/2009/01/planescape-torment-fully-modded.html).

After that you set the mod exe as windows exe in the wineskin app under advanced -&gt; tools.

The game is playing so badly that I was thinking of just biting the bullet and building a little gaming PC, but it's looking like that might cost ~$700, which is frustrating considering that I opted for a 15"" MacBook Pro instead of a cheaper alternative specifically so that I could play games on it with good settings. I have googled around a little and it looks like other people with the same computer as I have are running the game pretty decently, so I don't get what's wrong with me.

I recently bought the Gods &amp; Kings expansion on sale after not having played in a long time, and while the game started okay, I found that once I had explored a good chunk of the map, the game started lagging horribly, even on a smallish map. At this point, on the normal map view it will take several seconds to zoom or pan around at all, with a dismal frame rate, probably around 1 FPS. The animations are not at all smooth even when staying in one place. I can at least manage to play somewhat if I stay in the strategic view, but panning around the map is still very choppy that way and it is not a fun way to play at all.

I read that it might be a good idea to restart my computer to clear up some resources, but when I loaded my game after restarting, the imagine in the normal view was totally corrupted somehow. The toolbars and strategic view were fine but the map was mostly just weird gray lines.

Could I maybe buy Windows 7 for BootCamp and have it run better that way? Could that be a quick fix? Or will I really just need a better computer to run this game okay?

For what it's worth, I tried running it with the graphics card switching turned off, so it was running on the dedicated GPU for sure.

If you want help running your favorite Windows-only game on your Mac (without using that virtual machine stuff) shoot me a message (or reply to this topic) with the name of the game and a way to purchase the game online and I'll see if I can help you out. I will make you either a Wineskin wrapper or a Cider wrapper, but I will never provide a nocd exe with the wrapper. Remember to check The Porting Team first.

As a warning (thanks to ""badloop"" on reddit for reminding me) that many Wineskin AND cider wrappers do not function well/properly/at all on ATI cards.

Also, I'm definitely not the only one who can do this. Feel free to help others in this thread if you are a porter.

I don't like taking compensation/donations unless you want to download from a BitTorrent webseed/HTTP direct, or if you want the full game to be included in the wrapper (game license costs); I cannot afford to pay for that out of pocket. Send a private message for more information on compensation/donations/an estimate.

CRAZY ADDICTIVE.  I have never played this style of game before (except for some terrible console dungeon crawlers... and Gauntlet), so I didn't really get the addiction until I started it up.  The rewards system is really well-paced, you always feel like something significant is right around the corner.

A while back, when playing the default game with no custom content, I started having crashing issues that usually dealt with the game exiting full screen on its own, and then putting some random message saying, ""Expectation raised (random numbers) would you like to debug it? y/n."" No matter what I would press, the game would crash. I never had issues with restarting it, but it lead me into a long line of setting a 15 minute timer for saves, just so I wouldn't lose that much. After a while, it would go away. It was random, and it would go a long time without doing it.
I've been playing Late Night and Generations like crazy and nothing had been going wrong (apart from a few bugs), but I still save every 15 minutes. The problem hadn't happened in so long that I forgot about it, but it just happened again.
I can't keep playing Sims like this. I've looked for a fix for literally years and have never found anything. The error codes are always random, and they never make sense. EA isn't helpful, and they have never attempted to fix the issue (to my knowledge).

I've got the lower end 15"" retina macbook and after being pleasantly surprised by the performance under bootcamp with CS:GO running at retina with maxed settings and BF3 running pretty damn well at medium/high at normal resolutions, I've been dismayed of late to see that The Walking Dead runs pretty poorly and laggy, and that no matter what I do with Planetside 2 it always runs terribly, with all settings on low, to the point of being completely unplayable. (War Z runs OK at low, but it's a poorly made game, so.)

I am wondering if maybe something else is wrong? Is it possible that Windows is running off the Intel chip and not calling on the Geforce card now? I don't understand why performance in The Walking Dead would be so bad, since it is a graphically simple game. Anyone else have this issue or can help?

WC3 is said to be running on 10.7 and 10.8 if you have the installed files. Well I had those, but I have graphic errors, like in the Menu all the buttons and the cursor are just black. I assume it's because of the onboard graphic card (Intel HD 3000). I think my only options are dual booting or virtualisation. 
I have some apps running in the background, so I really want to do dual booting and
 I don't have Windows, so I wanted to know if that will work, or if I might have the same graphic problems or a too slow game using virtualisation.

For StarCraft even the game itself is PPC so I can't run it at all on Lion.  With the battle.net key I'm able to download the mac and the win version but as far as I know the Mac versions use a 13 character key, and the win version uses a 26 character key. So I might not even able to play it using windows without buying the win version of StarCraft. Is that true? And how will it run in a virtual machine?

* Are there any disadvantages, other than the obvious use of HD space?
* Do most games run pretty much like they would on a regular windows computer (provided they aren't too taxing in terms of memory or video)?
* Which version of Windows should I get?  As of right now, most of the games I would want to play are at least a few years old, but I always like to look ahead.  Also, where would I go to get the install disc?
* Do I need anything besides the two install discs (mac OSx and whichever version of windows)?

 I can confirm the controller seems to show up fine in the Systems Preferences, as well as Joystick Show I got some time ago, but Borderlands just doesn't work with the controller. The controller shows up identified as Microsoft in the System Information app, so I know this is working as expected.

 I have written to Aspyr asking for support as they specifically state the game works with the XBOX controller, but am wondering if anyone might have any suggestions or ideas.

 Let me know if anyone has some suggestions or ideas. I just can't find a sweet spot for my mouse settings on the game and find it just too spastic for accurate snipin'.

I am looking for help/easy explanation. I have searched on here and google and have some answers, but I am not the most tech savvy individual and somethings are not so clear. So I am asking for a simple and detailed answer to my question. Essentially a could you explain it like I am 5 type thing. 

I thank you in advance.

So I have a late 2011 macbook pro (got it at Christmas) and I love it. But there are a few things I would like to do and games to play, like many of you it needs Windows. 

So I already have Bootcamp and I have installed it. I now need Windows, and I don't have one lying around. I have found a Windows 7 OEM version I am considering buying....or looking for an online version. If I get the online version do I have to burn it to a disk? I have only been able to find a 64 bit version and I hear there are some issues with that. 

Now I believe I have about 460GB left of free space so some advice on how to partition it would be helpful as well. The games I would get are on Steam.

Essentially if someone can break it down step by step for me just so I have a clear idea of what I need to do and any other recommendations would be appreciated.

I've changed all the video quality settings to low &amp; minimum, yet gameplay still tends to be laggy. It's not impossible to play but the lag is noticeable.

Another thing that concerns me is the temperature of the Macbook Pro while playing. I know I can use smcFanControl to adjust the fans, and I know the unibodies are built to get hot, but the battery is getting incredibly hot and I already have had to replace it half a year ago (before I started playing Civ) so I'd like to try not to damage it.

So my question is the following, if I were to buy a used iMac or Mac Pro, which model would be good enough to play Civilization without lag and preferable with some better video quality?

If course I could just go buy a top-of-the-line Mac Pro/iMac but I don't have that kind of money, so I'm looking for some older models that would be decent enough to play the game.

A few questions:
1) What is the limit of this version of the MBP? Like, what's the best-looking game I can play on my computer?

2) How easy/hard/impossible is it to upgrade the hardware with the new unibody design?

3) Please tell me it plays GTA IV and I'll be able to mod it...I love GTA IV.
