I'm launching a **free** service called [RetroAchievements](http://www.retroachievements.org), which provides modified emulators so that you can play all your classic games, while all the time earning achievements for each game, 'Xbox-Live/Steam' style! [\(screenshot\)](http://retroachievements.org/TutorialImages/client2.png) It's still very much in beta stage, but I would really like to get some feedback, and I knew Reddit would be the right place to try this out!

Click here to sign up: www.retroachievements.org

At the moment we have a Mega Drive emulator RAGens (built from the source of **Gens** emulator), click [here](http://retroachievements.org/gameList.php) for the full list of achievements that are ready to be earned. Some games have more achievements than others, but the idea with RetroAchievements is that by crowd-sourcing the creation of the achievements, all games will end up having many, many more achievements and challenges. All the facilities to build your own achievements are built into the app, and instructions for using it can be found [here](http://www.retroachievements.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=22&amp;sid=b04d8c1360521ac5c739caa30c765670).

Due to the nature and licenses of the emulators, RetroAchievements is and will always be a free service.

I'll be here on Reddit for the next 3-4 hours, so if I can help with anything, please post and I'll reply ASAP :)

Please let me know what you think! Thanks!!

Edit: Thanks everyone for your feedback, it's 4am here so I'm off for sleep. Please leave any feedback, questions, rants, anything here and I'll get back to you asap!

Edit: I'm back! Thank you everyone for being so patient, there have been a few kinks but we're getting on top of things finally! Please post here or on RA, or message me if you have any questions or queries (i.e. achievements missing, bugs with the app, anything!)

**Actions Tutorial**

To swing the sword, HOLD Left Trigger(this is modifier button) and push the right thumbstick in any direction, or push a dpad button 

Sword Jab- R3


**Spin Strikes**-

 Vertical spin strike: hit L3 and R3 while moving the right analog stick up or down AT THE SAME TIME, it's kind of hard to do it first but you'll get the hang of it.- Unaffected by modifier

Horizontal spin strike: Hit the modifier and Rotate the left analog stick counter-clockwise and the right one clockwise AT THE SAME TIME (you dont need to hit the modifier and do the circles at the same time, just make sure the modifier is being held before making the circles) do the circles fast, if you take your time to do them, it wont read the move.
If you are having trouble with that motion, try to do it by pressing modifier, l3 and R3 while you move the right analogue stick horizontally at the same time. It's hard to do horizontal spin strikes, just avoid the skulltulas and you don't need to finish the log chopping practice at the very beggining

**Shield Block**- L3

**Skyward Strike**- Hold up on the Dpad until charged, then swing sword in any direction

**Finishing Blow**- Let go of the Left trigger button and quickly press R3 and L3 at same time

**Throwing/Rolling Bombs**-Press up on the Dpad to throw, down to roll, Hold Left trigger and move the right stick forward

**Rolling**- Hit L3 while dashing

**Shaking**-Hit L3 and R3 to shake enemies off of you or shake out of webs

**Leaping on vines/edges**- Hit R3

**Taking out the goddes Sword**- Press Dpad down to enter the ""ready"" stance, after this press A, after pressing A you can let go of the dpad down (and you need to do it) then just hold modifier(Left trigger) and press dpad down again (while holding A)

**Bird Controls**- Dpad to steer. To gain altitude you hold the left trigger and move the right stick up

**Tightrope Controls**- Hold Left trigger and use right stick to balance with Left and RIght. Up and down makes the rope shake off enemies

**Slingshot/Hookshot/Bow**
These controls are very problematic. because when you hold the modifier (Left trigger) it messes with your view. so you are stuck with a limited range of movement for the pointer. To help with this make sure you are facing what you are trying to hit . Press up-down on the d-pad until it stops within the range that you can point to. This is very finnicky and wonky and hitting the modifier too many times can mess up the controls requiring you to savestate and restart. But with enough patience and luck, it can be done.

**Gliding Controls**-Up d-pad slows you down keeps you by bottom of screen, down puts you in a divebomb To get the most distance you hold downleft or downright on the dpad

**Harp**- Press right bumper to bring it out. hold A and left trigger and move the right thumbstick ( I use an arcing motion) You move to each side of the thumbstick when the light circle is about to change direction or has just changed. It takes a bit of practice but you'll get the hang of it

**Special Cases**

**Bird Race**- Un-bind(or to a different key) the Z key on the nunchuk, so it doesn't make you look downward 

**Eye doors** -Make a new control configuration, but use a keyboard detting for this one. Have pitch up as arrow up, pitch back as down arrow, Yaw left as left arrow and Yar right as right. Quickly go ULDR on the keyboard.

**Circle Symbol Drawing**- Choose hybrid wiimote setting, and basically you use your mouse to draw your circle. Size the window down to a very small size to make it easier and give more range. 

**Trial Slash**-Make another config. Thrust as dpad up, Backward and Down as Dpad Down

**Fun-Fun Island Gliding Minigame**- Limit the fps in the config and use save states. 


**Slight Spoilers Beyond**


**Tentalus**-After the skyward strike is charged, hold up left or up right on dpad and swing the sword giving you diagonal slashes instead of vertical ones

**Ghirahim Battles**
Hold left trigger and hold right thumbstick to the right so your sword points that way. Use up and down to dpad to strike 

If the game isn't receiving inputs from the gamepad (say you just loaded the game and a save state) Switch the wiimote from emulated to hybrid wiimote (or vice versa) press ok and then switch back again. (You may not have to ever do this, but it might become a problem later)

If you de-check the reconnect wii mote on state loading option, it won't do the whole check everytime you load a state. Just confirm your controls do work and you won't have to sit through the reconnecting every time

[update!],34,4,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/emulation/comments/1gin79/do_you_guys_ever_do_any_rom_hacking_update/,"With the helpful suggestions of /u/BlizzardFenrir, I was able to get started tinkering around with ROM hacking. But I've reached a point where I'm sort of stuck and wanted to see if anyone else could offer a suggestion. I've been using the [NESdev wiki](http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Nesdev_Wiki) some, but a lot of it is too technically complex for me to understand, and their IRC channel #nesdev seems to be pretty barren.

So here's what I'm using so far:

* [Tile Layer Pro](http://segaretro.org/Tile_Layer_Pro), for pixel editing of the sprites and other game entities
* [HxD hex editor](http://mh-nexus.de/en/hxd/), for editing the ROM's code
* [FCEUX](http://www.fceux.com/web/home.html), NES emulator with awesome debugging tools, including a PPU viewer that shows which tiles are visible on-screen
* [This NES hex color palette chart](http://www.dev.bowdenweb.com/nes/nes-color-palette.html)

And since I've been mainly messing with Mega Man 2:

* [This article on Mega Man's main color palette location](http://www.romhack.de/dokumente/files/nes/palette/megaman_5_palette_hacking_doc.txt)

* [This Mega Man 2 ROM map](http://datacrystal.romhacking.net/wiki/Mega_Man_II:ROM_map) (thanks, /u/BlizzardFenrir), which gives data locations for many game elements, although I'm still have trouble finding certain things

-----

Here are some of the issues I still need help with. Even if you don't have firsthand information, any point in the right direction is appreciated.

* Although NES sprites are technically limited to three colors, Mega Man is five colors because his face is a separate sprite layered onto his head. I was able to find the palette information for MM's main sprite from the above article, but I have no idea where to find the palette data for his face. I can edit the pixels, but not their color. I need help learning how to find color palette data.

* Hex editors can be used for changing the display text, such as in the [opening title screen](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Ao63nmzuE). I don't know how to find where this data is located on the ROM.

This is pretty much where I'm stuck right now. And I'm sure I'll be stuck more in the future, but any help you could offer is much appreciated. Thanks!",,False,self,t5_2qh6d,False,,,True,t3_1gin79,http://www.reddit.com/r/emulation/comments/1gin79/do_you_guys_ever_do_any_rom_hacking_update/,

I finally finished a little pet project today after years of procrastination.  Had this old hard drive from my Atari ST on a shelf in the garage (bought in 1992 for $400!).  It contained artwork, short stories, college papers, letters, etc. from the 80s and 90s that I wanted to be able to save before the disk ceased to function.

It was a ""SupraDrive,"" a gigantic (in physical size, the capacity was a measly 52 megabytes) external hard disk with an ACSI connector (Atari's port for hard disks).  If I still had my old ST hooked up I could have just booted it up and figured out some serial cable hookup to transfer all the files to my PC, but I had long since abandoned that very ancient (but cool) machine.  However, I had known for some time that inside the enclosure was a standard 3.5"" SCSI hard drive.  So I opened it up and removed the drive (a Quantum, nice!) in hopes of hooking it up to a SCSI card I had bought off eBay.  

Except the SCSI card was dead.  In fact my PC wouldn't even POST with it in.  More Ebay junk.  Damn.  Looked at the Adaptec card and saw one of its components (a crystal oscillator) had come unsoldered.  I figured I got nothing to lose in trying to solder it back on.

30 minutes later, the oscillator was now connected to the card solidly but the solder points looked like abstract metal sculpture.  No way it would work.  I put the card back in the PC.  Holy Cow!  SCSI card now boots!  First barrier down.

But now Windows 7 has no idea how to read the Atari hard disk, it just wants to format it.  Googled for ideas.  Found an article on how to use the DD utility in Linux to make a raw image of the whole drive.  Booted into Ubuntu.  DD'ed the drive into a file.  The data was now saved but how do I view it?  Googled some more and found ""Hatari,"" an ST emulator.  Turns out it can read raw images created from Atari hard disks.

Loaded up the emulator and pointed it to the disk image.  Magic!  My virtual Atari booted up just like it did before I scrapped it in the late 90s.  And all those lost files are now saved on my modern PC.

Victory is sweet.

P.S.  I guess the lesson of the story is be careful what you wish for, I got all my files back, including some very low rez porn (320x200) and an embarrassing love letter I sent to a girl in high school.  Ugh.  Now I remember why I forgot about those.",,False,self,t5_2qh6d,True,,,True,t3_o3q48,http://www.reddit.com/r/emulation/comments/o3q48/how_i_hooked_an_atari_hard_disk_to_my_pc/,

The interface (well it's gamebrowser for Media Center), can be launched and fully controlled using an xbox 360 controller. Games can also be shut down from the controller, and you are brought back to the frontend after the game exits automatically.
Next step is to write an app that scans the program files folder for new PC games.

List of consoles and their state (emulated/physical/etc):

- Gameboy (Color) - Emulated via PC, Android, and/or Wii

- Nintendo 64 - Emulated via PC

- Gameboy Advance - Emulated via PC, Android, and/or Wii; Potentially will get a GBA flash cart and GBA SP.

- Gamecube - Physical console, softmodded Wii (requires the physical GBA and a GC link cable); Potentially play the games emulated on PC [I don't have any LCD TVs, this would improve the experience] and then transfer the save files to a memory card via Wii.

- Nintendo DS - Physical console and/or emulated via PC

- Wii - Softmodded console, Emulated on PC [same reasons/thoughts as GC]

Okay, now that we have that out of the way... I basically want to play through every Pokemon game (pretty much just the main ones, along with Stadium and Stadium 2 [N64]; Colosseum and XD [GC]; Battle Revolution and I think a Wiiware one [Wii]). Feel free to mention any others that include the ability to import Pokemon if I missed any.

So, I want to know if the following things are possible:

1. Can I transfer Pokemon from the Gameboy games into the Stadium [N64] games if I'm emulating all of it?

2. Is there any way to transfer Pokemon from the GB games into the Advance games? I'm willing to manually enter all of their stats into a save file creator or something (I have two different Action Replay devices for NDS as well, one for save files and one for codes; I know that you can throw codes into the GBA emulators too).

3. If I get a flash cart for GBA, will I be able copy save files to/from it as well?

4. I'm pretty sure it's still impossible, but has Dolphin fixed the GBA link feature with Gamecube, or added NDS link for emulators?

I'd appreciate pretty much any advice. Now that I'll have some free time on my hands, I'd love to dedicate a few hours a day to this crazy goal. The idea of having the same Pokemon team with me from the beginning just sounds incredible.

Also, I'd really like to play both the originals and remakes, if it wasn't clear. In approximate order, I would play Red, Blue, Yellow, Stadium 1, Silver, Gold, Crystal, Stadium 2, Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald, Colosseum, FireRed, Leafgreen, XD Gale of Darkness, Pokemon Box (To manage the massive collection I would have at this point), Diamond, Pearl, Platinum, Battle Revolution, Black, White, My Pokemon Ranch (To, again, manage the massive amount I'd have at this point), Black 2, and White 2.

If I have time after this, I might dive into GB TCG, Ranger series, Mystery Dungeon series, Conquest, etc... but those don't have the ability (or any potential way/reason) to import Pokemon, so they're not my top priority right now.

So yeah, thank you for reading this massive blob. Any input is helpful.

By true widescreen, I mean a hack that was first available on Project64 1.6 Jabo plugin named ""override aspect ratio"" or something like that. You can see [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmYsE3onOHA) to understand what I'm talking about.


Currently, I have the following setup:

Project64 1.7.0.50

Glide64 'Napalm WX' WIP graphics plugin

A Rice format high resolution pack downloaded off somewhere


Now, what I want is to use that widescreen hack along with high resolution textures. However, that's proven to be quite a challange. It's Jabo's plugin that does the widescreen override, and it doesn't support the high-res textures. You either have one or the other.

This is 2012 and most of the development on that department seems dead. All info I can find on Google is seemingly outdated (many posts from 2008, 2009...) and nothing of value can be found. I find really hard to believe not one graphics plugin was ever made that supported these two features in parallel.

Today, I can see a lot of demand for something like this. Can you imagine playing a classic such as Ocarina of Time on a 1080p display with high resolution graphics?

I hope this thread gets enough attention to initiate a discussion on the available resources to make this work. Has anyone ever heard of a plugin that can achieve both of these things?

Just released a new version of Arcan, which is not strictly an emulator and not a frontend but something inbetween.

It uses a combination of libretro (so the same emulation cores/ save states etc. as RetroArch) and hijacking other programs to expose them as scriptable objects in a 2D/3D graphics engine (see the wiki for the LUA API). These can then be used to do all crazy sort of things (too long a list to bore you with here but there's everything from video encoding/decoding to shaders in there) but the most used part is 'Gridle', a feature packed frontend.

Bigger points in this release is the addition of networked remote control / secondary displays and a specialized tool just for streaming.

I tried the ""most popular"" of each systems emulator and these are the best versions. Meaning best play speed, features, and game compatibility.

[Super gnes](http://www.mediafire.com/?ggggv5c99djk15h)

 That is a cracked version of the newest paid full version. It works absolutely perfect and it looks great. auto downloads game art and has 11 quick saves. normal game saves work too.

[FPse- for ps1 games](http://www.emuparadise.me/emulators/files/user/com.emulator.fpse-72-0.10.57-278.rar)

[the binary file](http://www.mediafire.com/?y6kmwfa8peq9joi)

[here's a list of games that work.](http://www.roms4droid.com/psxcompatibility.php) If you don't know, the processor can handle all of these games at full speed with sound off. So it's pretty much work or no work depending on the game. sometimes they just won't be compatible with a certain version. This version had the highest compatibility of what I've been able to try.

[GameBoid for gb/a/c games](http://www.emuparadise.me/emulators/files/user/com.androidemu.gba-65-2.4.7-1640.rar)

[bios](http://www.emuparadise.me/biosfiles/gbabios.rar)

Works perfect, save states and fast forward, etc

[n64oid](http://www.emuparadise.me/emulators/files/user/N64oid_v2.7-1187.rar)

Works with every game i tried but horrible slow down on most. I haven't tried overclocking, have been looking into configs that may help. not much luck yet. mariokart64 works awesome though, so that's something at least.
 
****
n64oid and fpse can also use the hard analog sticks, but you need to custom rom up to 4.0 to do it.

Also, it's not possible to root the xperia if it's been updated, and you can't overclock unless it's been rooted- i should note that the n64 games with slowdown *should* be playable with an overclock, i haven't tried personally, just watched it on youtube. Important to note though, is that if you downgrade you lose all of your apps, so if you're thinking about overclocking make sure it's the first thing you do.

*edit: you can update after you've rooted and overclocked.
****

edit: apps&gt;menu&gt;settings&gt;application&gt;check allow installations to install these apps

All I need is something that accepts input from my 360 wireless controller, and lets me read the system/game names from my couch, plus launch a game. 

I've not once been able to get XBMC's Advanced Launcher or Rom Collection Browser to index my SNES roms or launch N64 roms.  

I was told ""use hyperspin"" so I spent a month and a half torrenting a huge collection of videos in a ""basic"" hyperspin deployment.  Then found out that (a) there is no clean way to remove games I don't own, from the list, and that (b) every game I do own needsmtonbe renamed to match the weird ""(u)"" and ""[!]"" filenames used in hyperspin.  It would take weeks of tedium to set up games ill never even launch.  Not to ,entiom it is flashy, noisy, obtrusive, and doesn't serve my regular-PC-game launching. 

So I switched to Steam Big Picture mode, which would be perfect if there was *any freaking* way ever, to sort and display the rom titles.  

In theory, I could create badge artwork and create custom shortcuts, calling the emulator, and then injecting the ROM file name as a launch modifier. This would be all kinds of time prohibitive, since we are talking about roughly 200 games to map.  

Why is this so hard? I can configure the cmd-line-happy emulators myself.  But I need something clean to navigate with,  if playing a SNES game involves me switching to a keyboard/mouse, or leaving the sofa, then it's broken.

Every time I want to play Wii on my PC, I have to follow a sequence of things to do for my Wiimote to work. I wondered if there was a simpler way.

First of all, I'm on a laptop, using Windows 8.

To add a Wiimote, I need to go in PC settings: http://i.imgur.com/rxZdgFR.jpg, click on ""Add a device"", hold 1 and 2 on my Wiimote, wait a minute until it's installed. Then, for the Wiimote not to disconnect, I have to open a software called Wii Pair, pair my Wiimote (which takes some time). Then I can play.

The thing is, if I turn my Wiimote off, it will become ""disconnected"" in PC settings. Wii Pair will also consider it ""disconnected"", but it will keep it ""paired"".

But once the Wiimote is turned off, I have no way to turn it on again. My PC won't recognize it. I have to delete it from the PC settings, and add it and pair it again.

Since Wii Pair is able to remember my Wiimote even if it's disconnected, I'd like to know if there is a simpler way to turn the Wiimote on again, instead of deleted and reinsalling it every single time? A way that would allow me to just press the Power button, or 1 and 2 buttons, to use my Wiimote?

Ive been looking around at a bunch of different companies that make android emulation tablets with built in physical controllers.

The Nvidia Shield looks like it could be very good with emulation, but it's also quite pricey.

I've heard a bit of talk on forums that the tegra 4 may be able to do PS2 emulation. Any truth to that? There's video of the Tegra 5 running Battlefield 3 out there, just to put things into perspective.

Then there are a bunch of smaller companies making these gamepads, and I just don't know what to think!

What are some of the best ones out there? Are any great ones coming out in the near future?

When I turned the system off and on again, the save was still there. However, after a day or two when I picked it up again, my save was gone and it only had the option for starting a new game.

I thought that the Fast Load might be the culprit, so I switched back to patch load. Surprisingly, it loaded after about 20 seconds. I played to a point where I could save and shut the system down. When I turned it on after a few seconds and booted the game, the save was there. However, again, after waiting a few hours the save file disappeared again.

* AMD Phenom II X6 1055T

I have tried both the [jpcsp](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/jpcsp/) and [ppsspp-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ppsspp-git/) from the arch user repository.  While both installed correctly, are up to date, and will somewhat launch games, neither one will do so with an acceptable framerate (framerate is currently below 1 fps).

My main question is if this is due to a lack of development of either of the emulators, and should I search for another psp emulator for a linux 64 bit os, or is it that my hardware is insufficient.

The other emulators I have tried to run (nes, snes, n64, ps1, and ps2) all run almost perfectly.

If there is any other information that could be considered helpful I will provided it.

I was impressed that everything *worked* but frustrated my framerates were always 19fps or 49fps or some other frustrating amount of *slow.*

I was even trying to OC my Core i7 870 *just* because I'd read that the Emulator only multithreads across the first 2 cores and my raw GHz clock speeds are slow. I couldn't understand why performance was poor, and I thought I'd toyed with all graphics options available. 

Finally, I started systematically applying ""speedhacks"" changes and was BLOWN AWAY by the performance gains. I have to vertsync to peg the frames below 60fps, and even with 6x resolution it's buttery smooth. 

I just have to say, ""WHAT THE HELL!?! THIS IS GORGEOUS!!"" I was blown away by the ""Native"" and ""6x"" resolution improvements, with next to no impact on performance. I found myself yelling at my television that the PS2 visuals were gorgeous in a way I'd never known. 

I insisted my girlfriend play the intro to a game or two, and she humored me with ""mmmms"" and ""aahhhhhhs"" as I flailed my arms and carried on about performance improvements. She could tell the difference.

So, now I'm diving into PS2 games and need to raid local used sales. What games do I *need* to buy? I haven't owned any stationary console between Super Nintendo and Nintendo Wii (playing Okami on Wii just 'cause it allows bypassing repetitive cut scenes, so check that one off the list).

I am uninterested in dungeon-crawlers and hit-it-with-your-sword-to-accrue-gil-to-buy-bigger-sword games.  My main interest is couch coop games, particularly titles that are safe for all ages. Any great picks?

*edit: Also, probably a long shot, but are there any recent Playstation 1 emulators out there that allow the same crazy-resolution-multiplication? I have ePSXe 1.7.x with the Phil's 2.9.x graphics plugin but don't see such options.

The first game I picked up was Pokemon Red. I played for 7 or so hours, saving and loading multiple times over multiple days with on problem, then one day I turn it on and boom - my saved game is back to hour one.

I thought I accidentally loaded a saved state or something, but I have never used it - and did all my saving in the game itself.

That being said I am looking for an alternative. I'm really happy with the SNEX9x that Robert Broglia put out, and was looking into his GBC emulator. One thing I really liked about SNES 9x is that it had a ""suspended state"" whenever you switched apps. Does his GBC emulator have this, and has anyone who uses it had any weird issues with it? Do you recommend it?

EDIT: One thing i DID like about RetroArch was that it allowed you to make a custom path for your saved games to go - which made setting up a folder sync between different devices very easy, which AFAIK SNES 9x does not allow you do to, so it would follow that Robert's GBC emulator also lacks that ability.

I have had Epsxe v1.7 for a while, and it used to work just fine. However I had to reinstall Windows on my machine a few weeks ago and haven't touched Epsxe until today. It asked me to go thru the configuration wizard when I opened so I did. The problem is I can't remember which plugins I used before that worked.

The weird thing is I have gone thru every video plugin I have and 95% of them crash with that error. The ones that don't crash are ones that run the game way too fast, or have lots of graphical errors.

Wario Land Shake It - the shake just doesn't work on an emulated wiimote (gamepad or k/b).

Donkey Kong Country Returns - Sound suddenly takes a massive shit. Loud and glitchy sounds that cause ear rape. Occasionally pausing helps, usually nope.

Rayman Origins - same as DKCO, slightly less bad sound issues.

Kirby Wii - no sound for cut scenes.

New Super Mario Wii - animated coins still don't work.

Super Mario Galaxy - still needs LLE, hangs on the big stars at the end of worlds.

Warioware - no easy way to switch between sideways/upright wiimote: so you have to alt tab and change controls EVERY game.

Anyway it just seems like compatibility has gotten worse with 3.5+, and sound issues/emulated wiimote support is still really sketchy.

Is it best to just go back to older builds like 3.0 ? Possibly get the zelda skyward sword dolphin build to fix the emulated wiimote crap ?

Searched the dolphin forums for these issues but 1) the search function is shit 2) they don't really seem to bother with sound/controls.

Now, I'm replaying it on an emulator. The thing is that though the game seems to be running at normal speed, whenever I do something that involves a timer (minigames and the timer for the pufferfish boss for example), the timer seems to go a lot faster than it should and this makes certain tasks impossible. As a matter of fact, I timed it. Based on a youtube video of someone playing the game, 10 timer seconds = 10 real seconds for them (and I think they were using an emulator) but for me, 10 timer seconds = 7.5 real seconds. In other words, I have 25% less time for those kinds of tasks. I am using Project64 2.0 with default plugins except for the video plugin which is Glide64. It seems to just be the timer acting up because if everything was faster, I'd still be able to run to wherever I need to go because my characters would be faster as well. I have found no documentation online regarding this problem, so I don't know what to do. Any ideas?

EDIT: I think I found something. In the rom settings menu, I turned off fixed audio timing and sync to audio and set vi refresh rate to 1650 and ai count per byte to 469.

There is a wireless adapter on the MoBo and I can overclock with it. That's why I chose it. 

The case is small but looks like the air flow is decent enough to overclock.

I took a ""Gold certified"" PSU because they usually run cooler and quieter.

Overall, I think it's a little bit more expansive than I thought so I'm asking before buying.

- Could I pick cheaper parts for the same performance or better?
- Is my GPU strong enough for Wii/Gamecube/PS2? 
- How will Dolphin run with this?

4GB RAM

ATI Radeon 5770 Graphics card

Edit: Windows 7 Home 64 bit

I have an... *acceptable* PC gaming setup. It's nothing amazing and the card is outdated but it all does the trick and can run a lot of modern games quite well on their highest settings with minimal to no problems.

So I recently upgraded my Dolphin to the latest build, 3.5-125 and decided to give Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes a spin. I was having some trouble with the audio lagging far behind the video before, which had already had bad framerate, so I upgraded and followed the settings the Dolphin wiki suggests: LLE, Framerate limit to Audio, and EFB copies to RAM.

Well... it's certainly better, and the good news is my framerate has picked up significantly and runs pretty smooth. The bad news though, is that the sound is cutting out repeatedly and quickly, fluctuating from quiet to sound over and over. I'd say 3-4 audio cut outs per second. I guess what I'm trying to say is it's choppy. 

Anyway, it sounds terrible. Graphics, great. Cutscenes, fine. Framerate, nice. Audio, gross. Any ideas on what I could do to alleviate the issue? I've looked around online for quite a while and have found nothing, and toyed with the settings a restarted the game for over an hour, no dice.

I tried PM: TTYD, too, to see how that fared, and the audio lags a bit in-game, nothing bad or cringe inducing, so... not sure if that could help you at all.

I have been working on building an emulator PC and I was using hyperspin for my frontend.

That program was just taking up way too much of my free time. I'm in the process of switching to Maximus Arcade. This program seems a lot more straight forward. I know it's not free and I'm willing to pay the $25. My only gripe with it is that I can't seem to figure out is how to add videos to it. There are absolutely no tutorials on how to do this on youtube or the net period. 

Now, when I say videos I'm not talking about adding an swf background to the frontend. I already know how to do that.

I'm talking about little ""snipet previews"" when you scroll over the games so it can play a preview video for the game. 

I currently have all of the video files for all of the games I have. I just need to find a way to import them into Maximus and get them to work with each game.

I had this setup in hyperspin, but all I managed to finish setting up was super nintendo because it took me so long to set everything up, I'm switching to Maximus. I realize I'm enjoying Maximus' simpler setup and have decided to use this as my front end for my emulator pc.

I'm very curious:  What are your emulation setups?  It's been quite a while since i've had any comprehensive set of roms, and the nostalgia has hit me again. I'm looking into starting up a collection.  I'm hoping to receive an invite to Underground Gamer to get started, however, there are so many great projects and front ends that people use now, I was wondering what you all prefer as your setup?  Do you use the classic method of loading an emulator and selecting from a huge file, or do you have a fancy front end?  

Do you par down your collection to only have what you need, or are you a completionist with the artwork, video etc?   What sites/projects/etc. do you recommend exploring for front end gameplay?  

Are there any ""homebrew"" consoles, made from an old laptop?

Alternate questions: could the saves simply be transferred using the adapter to a PS3 then to a flash drive for usage with emulators? Also, can a PS2 multitap access memory cards without plugging into a controller port?

---------------------------------------------------

Hello, hope this is the best place for this (I've been juggling between posting this to some other gaming subreddits, but I think this question is most relevant here). I've been trying to get back into playing through some old PS2 games, but I happen to move around a fair amount, so I thought it'd be easier to rip my PS2 library to .isos and run them like PC games through an emulator. 

However, I don't exactly want to restart my progress in all of them either, meaning I've been researching ways to maybe possibly copy their saves over. The only options I've found thus far have been to find a way to run MCBoot and uLaunchElf on my PS2 and copy them to a flash drive that way, which given the MCBoot install methods isn't exactly easy (or certain, in some cases), and then the more convenient option, use a PS3 memory card adapter.

Only issue is, from what I've been reading, it doesn't seem like much work has been put towards this effort, besides getting the adapter recognizable and PS1 memory cards accessible through it. All the posts I've seen related to this have been around 4 to 2 years old, with a few year old posts yearning for the option. So I guess I'm joining those year old posters in asking: has anything changed on this? Any progress that my search phrasing has overlooked? 

Also, am I just making this more complicated than it needs to be, and copying the saves to a PS3, then to a flash drive, then using appropriate software on the PC to import them into the emulator memory cards would work? Oh, and as a question out of nowhere that is still related, can a PS2 multitap access the memory cards without plugging into a controller port?

1375285302.0,9,self.emulation,1jfda8,Review - JXD S5110b,9,0,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/emulation/comments/1jfda8/review_jxd_s5110b/,"Hi Guys!

After 20 days of wait, last week I finally got my hands in my JXD Device.
So, after a week of tweaks and tests, I can finally give a statement of the device. 
The quick answer is, the device IS worth the value.
But you will have to spend some time tweaking the device before it gets perfect ! So, if you don't want to spend some time with tweaks, this device is NOT for you. But when it's running fine, it's a great device.

So, heres what I think.

* Build Quality 

The device doesn't seems and feel like a cheap device.
The device has a good grip and good weight. Not much to talk about it in here.

The buttons are great too. 
Response is what you expect. 
No delays, no hanging. The analogs are great too, very similar to the PSP one.
All the games and emulators that I tested went fine with the controls.

* Software

I've didn't tried the stock ROM, instead grabbed the Skel ROM right after I take the device from the box.
The ROM is from the Open Handhelds [Open Handhelds Forum] (http://forum.openhandhelds.net/index.php/board,139.0.html) .

This ROM fixes a lot of problems of the original firmware. Like the Analongs not being real analogs. You can read the full change log and see for yourself. 

But I really recomend using it, because this ROMs removes lots of crappy software that comes bundled, and the users with the original ROM from JXD said that the SkelRom puts more power on the device. So, use it ! 

The only problem that I faced is with the Android Governors.
The device has a bug, that when you put the device to sleep, when it comes back, all the emulators or games became ULTRA SLOW. If you touch the screen, everything goes back to normal.

This is because of the way that THIS particular version of Android for the device handles the power saving. When the device goes to Sleep, Android sets the device processor to 350 mhz.
This makes anything that you trie to play a pain. 

So, my solution to this problem was to grab a CPU Manager from Google.
The device has root out of the box, so using a CPU Manager was no trouble.
In this post [Fix for the Wake up Bug] (http://forum.openhandhelds.net/index.php/topic,380.msg2238.html#msg2238) I detail all my steps to fix the problem. So, take a look on the link and all the information that you need are there. ;)

After this, the device is perfect! But until I figured out this problem, I was thinking about to put the device away and buy an Nvida shield. After some tweaks I'm simply loving it ! :D

* Battery

This is the only real thing that I don't like in the device.
The battery supports 2:30 hours of Gameplay, whitout Wi-Fi. 
For me that only use the device on the subway in my way to home or work, it's fine.
But for long trips, you will be disapointed.

I'm doing some research in changing it. My discoverires so far are that if I use a same voltage battery I can go without trouble, but I have to research more.

The other problem is that the battery takes a long time to full recharge. About 2 hours with the device powered off.

* Games

The machine has a dual core processor.
So playing games isn't a problem at all.
I tried on the device 

- Max Payne
- GTA 3
- GTA Vice City
- Shadowgun
- Dead Trigger

All games runned fine. 
No slowdowns, no hic-ups.

The Skel Rom bundles TinCore Keymapper, wich you can map touch input to the Joystick.
So games like Max Payne that don't support joystick out of the box can be played with it.
Played 2 hours of Max Payne, and didn't missed anything on the controls. 
You spend some time tweaking Tincore and your game. But once you adjust the controls, you only have to load the profile for your game, and you are good to go.

* Emulation

All the emulators that I tried run fine on the device.
The only exception is the PSP one. But I think this is more an emulator cause than the device.
I have a Galaxy Nexus phone , and PSP emulator doesn't run good on it either.

List emulators I tested with sucess.

- NES.emu (Full Speed/Full Joystick Support)
- GBC.emu (Full Speed/Full Joystick Support)
- Snes9X EX+ (Full Speed/Full Joystick Support)
- MD.emu (Full Speed/Full Joystick Support)
- Muppen64 Plus AE (Full Speed/Full Joystick Support)
- FPSe (Full Speed/Partial Joystick Support - Doesn't recognize the second analog)
- My Boy (Full Speed/Full Joystick Support)
- SuperGNES (Full Speed/Full Joystick Support)
- ePSXe (Full Speed/Full Joystick Support)
- DosBox Turbo (Full Speed/Full Joystick Support - Only played Alone in the Dark on it)

I still have to test :

- Mame4Droid
- PCE.emu
- ScummVM
- aFBA
- Ataroid

I tried Retroarch, but despite the good speed on the Snes emulator, I didn't managed to configure the controls for it. So, I will come back to it, IF I find some game that I cannot play on other emulators. For now, It will be in stand by.

I don't think I will have speed problems with the remaing emulators to test, but as soon I get they running, I will update this post.

So, I think that's it guys.

How exactly does the PSX emulation work? I know that it runs well, but the dualshock 1 already had two R and L buttons, while the PSP only has one. I am also not a big sony fan, so I am not sure about that, but the analog sticks that were added to later versions became relatively important in many games, right? So isn't that a problem?

I am also not really familiar with emulation anywhere else than the PC, so I wanted to know how the jailbreaking works, since a friend told me some years ago that it can destroy your PSP if done wrong.

And last: If I do not care that much about size (the biggest one is still compact enough for me), is there any reason to not just buy the one I can get cheapest? The PSGo seems nice, since it doesn't have a disc slot, but on the other hand it looks like the buttons are very close together and I am not sure whether that is a good idea with my relatively big hands.

What I don't understand, is what were the original developers intentions for playing these games, 4:3 or 16:10?  Most games I've purchased such as Doom from Steam or Descent from GoG default to the 16:10 aspect, but it just doesn't feel right to me as I remember playing them on old 4:3 CRTs.

I grew up with Sega, then N64 was my first Nintendo console. I want to start playing classic SNES games I missed out on, but so far it's not going well.

I tried SNES9x, and I dislike it because it doesn't have V-SYNC. The horizontal-tearing in graphics really bothers me.

I tried ZSNES, and it seemed to work better than 9X at first, but then I noticed games would randomly slow down. Super Mario World would lag if there were too many Koopa's on the screen at once, or Super Mario RPG would lag at random areas (really weird areas, like dialog's or cut scenes, not action areas.)

I also noticed that Mario RPG was damn glitchy on ZSNES.


I did some research and found BSNES, which runs well enough but has random hiccups. Also, it's shaders don't seem to do anything, and it doesn't have Super 2xSAI.

So it looks like I'll have to suffer thru 9X's horizontal tearing, if it's the only one that will run at speed with 2xSAI.

I find it shocking that it's this difficult to emulate SNES properly. I've been emulating Genesis for years, and it always works fine. It must be the emulated ""blast processing"" ;-)

So... my question is, is there a good SNES emulator I'm forgetting? Or is there a way to configure 9X / ZSNES / BSNES to work with the following expectations:

- VSYNC
- 2xSAI Shader (or equivalent, not just anti-alias aka ""blur"")
- No random slow-downs or hiccups mid-play

I am on a 64 bit AMD 3.1 GHZ dual core CPU, with 4GB ram using GeForce GTS 250 (1GB Video Memory.)

I can understand why BSNES would be slow, since it's hardcore emulation... but ZSNES? I'm surprised that x86 assembly emu has hiccups on Super Mario World / RPG.

I'm thinking about getting a Genesis ever drive. Then I saw all the retro USB controllers I can get (NES, SNES, N64) and I have a Microsoft side winder six button pad which works with Genesis emulators very well.

So isn't the PC emulation for these systems perfect by now? The only gripe I have is the damn set up it takes to run PC emulators , it's not just a sit on the couch and play event. I always out put to my TV but I would need a GREAT front end recommendation where I could start and exit games and have all the settings done with while using one controller.

If I go the PC route I was thinking of a USB hub with all the retro controllers attached, this would actually be cheaper then the Everdrive for just the Genesis.

I do have a modded Xbox 1 that can do all this emulation with nice high def filters and a high def cable but the controller is NOT good for retro emulation. I have a PS2 controller adapter for the Xbox as well , link to a great 6 button PS2 controller would also help!

TL:DR, Flash cart or PC Emulator. Need a no fuss one controller PC front end. Would love a great PS2 6 button controller for emulation on Xbox 1 (with adapter)

I cooked something up over the weekend to do this in Windows.

Essentially what I'm doing is grabbing the screen from the other window, doubling it, and rotating it, while letting the original window have focus in the background so it can handle input.

It's not perfect yet, there are still some big glitches, but feel free to try it out. Instructions are on the blog page.

The worst glitch is that your task bar will disappear and the program will crash. This can be fixed by running the program again, or killing and restarting explorer.exe.

I have tested it with fceux, ZSNES, Fusion, and pSX, also notepad.

The program must be running in windowed mode, and it works best when using a software render mode. OpenGL and direct3d processing is iffy right now.

1. Why is it so difficult to emulate these consoles (particularly the PS3 and 360?)

2. How, exactly, are these emus created? Using publicly known system information? Reverse-engineering? More?

3. Is it true that, if the developers of the consoles themselves were to create and release an emulator for their respective systems, would it run much better than emus that have been created by people outside of the dev teams?

4. What is the main barrier, besides hardware of the consoles, that is holding software-based emulation back? Consoles are basically computers, but I realize they are very specific computers. It's difficult for me to grasp the fact the modern PC hardware is simply unable to get the job done.

5. If one were to build a PC today, using the best possible components available, would PS3 and 360 emulation even be a little worthwhile?

I have never used any emulators before and was wondering if someone here could help me with using PCSX2 and ROMs.

The game I am trying to play is Summoner 1. I used to play it on my PS2 with my uncle when I was very young and as such I did not fully understand the game, but it was my favorite. Having played Skyrim recently and Bioshock Infinite I feel as though games from the older generation were better, I can't explain it.

If someone could help me or link me to a guide about using PCSX2 and how to use ROMs that would be great. I gave my friend my PS2 and he said he was able to get something called a legal bios to get it working. When I installed PCSX it had said I needed a legal BIOS from a PS2, I had no idea how to do that so my friend helped me out.

Thanks, hopefully someone more experienced than I can help me. Even if you can't help me you should try Summoner, it's a great RPG :)

edit: is it illegal to use ROMs? I have an actual copy of Summoner for PS2 which I can burn thankfully. If you want to buy it legally you can get in on ebay / amazon for $3-$7.

I want to get a laptop that is capable of running PCSX2.

Why a laptop? Well, I can't stand handhelds or touch screen controls. I didn't grow up with a Game Boy, I grew up playing consoles. So when I travel to my in-laws, it'd be nice to have something to do besides play Angry Birds.

It would be nice if I could install other emulators on it, or maybe even play a few Steam games in big picture mode on my HDTV, but it's main purpose will be to emulate PS1/PS2 games.

So here's the question: Specs?

It doesn't necessarily have to handle all the plugins at top quality output, but some reasonable enhancement to the game graphics would be nice.

So, I need to know what I'm looking for.

What processor should I be after? Will any i3 work?

What about the graphics card? GPU?

Any guidance would be very much appreciated.

EDIT: I should mention, I'm going to try to find the laptop on Craigslist for cheap. If I were buying it new, I'd just go in an get the best specs I could afford and return it if it didn't work.

So I'm going on a road trip here soon and will be in the car for 50+ hours and am looking for a way to kill some time. So here's where my question lies:

I've been playing primarily PSX and N64 games, but dabble in most available emulators.

I currently have a Samsung Galaxy SIII that I use for the occasional emulation (I pair it with a Wiimote with classic controller attachment), but I don't particularly like the feel of the Wiimote and I don't really want to use the touch screen controls. I also have a Samsung Galaxy Tab (not the 10"" one) that I haven't done anything with, but am open to using that to emulate for the bigger screen.

Should I:

* Continue using my Samsung Galaxy SIII with the classic Wii controller/purchase a PS3 controller?
* Emulate on the Galaxy Tab? Is this powerful enough to emulate well, etc?
* Buy an Xperia Play? (The appeal here lies in my knowledge of the Android operating system as well as the built in game controls).
* Buy a PSP? (I've had one before, but I don't know the current emulation/modding scene, but from other posts I get the feeling it's pretty easy to manage).
* Buy a PSP Go? I would actually prefer this to the traditional PSP, due to the sliding, but I've heard very bad things about it. Anyone know what the emulation is like on this/why it's not good to have?
* Buy a PS Vita? I have no idea what kind of situation is available here.
* Buy a different smart phone/tablet? Any suggestions are welcome.

It's really not much of a computer but it was free and I think I can get it to do most of what I need. Here's what I'm doing/thinking.

I have it hooked up to my 47"" vizio and have installed k-fusion and snes9x (it runs these nicely). The small footprint makes the computer ideal as it fits very conspicuously below my very minimalist entertainment center thing. The TV is wall mounted. The OptiPlex also has ten, yep count 'em, ten usb ports making it good for controller hookup. Keeping a neat and clean look is important to me, as a result I plan to keep using this computer despite its apparent flaws. 

The integrated graphics surprisingly will perform a resolution that fits my vizio (1920x1050 or whatever). However, the computer is aggravatingly chuggy at times. The real bottleneck I presume is in the 1gb of RAM, though I suspect the HD is on it's way out and isn't helping matters. I plan to upgrade RAM to the maximum 4Gb (in reality; 3.5gb windows xp 32 bit). Additionally, I am going to upgrade the video card to something cheap with 1gb dedicated memory. Given these two changes I beleive the computer should be completely capable of running these emulators as I have had lesser computers run them at good consistent 60fps.

It should be noted that I would like to do an N64 emulator and Dreamcast as well, however, I am unsure how taxing this will be. Comments? I am unsure what how taxing these games are on GPU, should I be looking for something more than described above? 

With my other emulator setups I typically just use my old Super Nintendo controller with a two controller usb hub. Aggravatingly I have to configure the controller setups every time I run SNES9x or K-fusion. Is there a work around for this? Do usb controllers fix this? I will likely soon purchase n64 type controllers, should I get a hub or just get the usb version?

One additional note, I also plan to use this as a media server. At some point a hard drive upgrade from the measly 80gb (or failure) is going to be required. Is installing an SSD as the primary drive going to improve performance for emulation (assuming I use an external drive for media storage)? 

Thanks in advance!

The only negative reviews on Amazon for the Tomee controller are actually from customers who received the Retrolink model.  The remaining reviews recommend it for NES/SEGA/SNES/MAME emulation and even for the occasional N64 title.   

[This excellent video review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Z2uNebqhOI) was what made me most confident in the Tomee option.

But before purchasing I thought I'd ask the experts. Which is better - spending $10 on the Tomee or spending $20 to get a real SNES controller and a USB adapter from Smartjoy? (I know at least to avoid the GTron adapters.)

It's the first emulator that I've found running under Java which always had a bad connotation in my mind but it works under both windows and linux. Development is in beta but 300+ games are compatible.

Video has 1x, 2x, and 3x resizing options. Shaders are supported but are in beta. They work flawlessly for me though. The controls pop-up can be left open while games are being played. I haven't tested if you can actually *change* controls but its nice to have a guide.

There is very little documentation on in game settings but the forums are active. I have a question in about video settings specifically so hopefully I can make it look even prettier. Even so, with a few boxes checked games look very nice.

I'm running a quad core machine with 4gb memory and a GTS 250.

Windows 7 64bit - still using 32 bit version of JPCSP and 32 bit Java runtime environment. (the forums say it works better this way)

Other necessary download is Sony SonicStage for audio. free download.

Tested game: FF7 Crisis Core. With default settings it ranges from 30-45 FPS. With boxes checked for compatibility it stays at max framerate but doesn't tell me what that actually is.

The thing is, I have the *.sav files synchronized to my Dropbox account which in turn is retrieved on the laptop. No$GBA can read the save files without problems but after I've saved in-game from No$GBA, it won't get read back in GameBoid.

So far, I've already tried:

* setting `SAV/SNA File Format == Compressed` in the no$gba.ini file
* setting `SAV/SNA File Format == Uncompressed` in the no$gba.ini file
* setting `SAV/SNA File Format == Raw` in the no$gba.ini file
* using [this converter](http://gba.mywebcommunity.org/)
* specifying what save type to use

But it just won't work properly with GameBoid. When I set the `SAV/SNA File Format` to `Raw`, it did get loaded into GameBoid but I can't save over it. Meaning it's treating the *.sav file as read-only.

You may be wondering why I don't just use VBA or any variants of it (VBA-M, etc). Well, for some reason, it runs very very poorly on my laptop (an old one) but No$GBA just flies on it. I don't lag at all when I use No$GBA.

I wrote an image file of the game and it doesn't seem to want to play the music with either ePSXe or PCSXR. For a little while I thought it did with PCSXR, but after moving around some saves, it seems to have ceased doing so. 

I checked another person's image of the game and found that it was ripped to several .bin files, and I've gathered that that may be necessary for this game in particular (Wild 9). However, I've had a time trying to find any guide to how to do this. I've seen many of the suggested image-creating pieces of software, but it looks like it *should* function more or less the same as Imgburn, from what I can tell, but I did give CloneCD a shot once without it really doing much differently.

Can anyone here give me a hand? This is really frustrating, and I'm almost certain if I intend to pursue PS1 emulation, I'm going to encounter this more than with just this game. 

Any help would be much appreciated. 

**Edit:** 
Key problem:
Multi-track audio game ripping to one .bin file. The .cue picks that up and rolls with it. Modifying it only results in either no music (i.e. more of the same) or awful static garbage. 

Solution being sought:
A method to rip the game into multiple .bin files so it will hopefully generate the appropriate .cue and run the music. 

What I currently have:
A functioning image of the game in all rights, with sound effects and all, only music is absent.

Emulators tried:

* ePSXe
* PCSXR
* Retroarch
* Mednafen

Software tried:

* IMGBurn
* CloneCD
* winbin2iso

Hello, /r/emulation.  I posted a few days ago to /r/raspberrypi about this [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1jj8gk/help_with_usb_controller_files_in_retropie/) and didn't receive any comments that solved the problem. (I figured out how to do everything that the commenters said eventually).

My problem is that I'm using a Retrolink usb controller to set up with the RetroPie project software RetroArch and the configuration is not working.  The front end menu works fine, but the in-emulator controls didn't configure correctly.  I ran the command to configure and began doing so, then the ""up"" and ""left"" buttons wouldn't take.  I know nothing is wrong with this buttons for a fact.  So I went into the ~/configs/all/retroarch.cfg file and changed the + signs to - signs on those axes.  Those buttons still would not work on the emulator BUT upon running the retroarch-joyconfig tool again, the buttons are recognized.  I don't know why these changes won't take with the emulators but I suspect that the emulators are reading another file to get the configuration.  I've deleted the retroarch.cfg file before and it still runs all the buttons except up and left.

So if anyone knows answers to these questions, please feel free to answer:

- Why would the ""up"" and ""left"" buttons not work upon the configuration to begin with?
- How can the configuration stick even when retroarch.cfg is deleted?
- Why does altering the retroarch.cfg file alter joyconfig's ability to detect my 'up' and 'left' buttons but not the emulator's ability to do so?

They don't have to be name brand or anything, but I've seen SNES controllers with USB ends and I don't think they are made by Nintendo.  I also wouldn't mind using something like the RetroUSB to use the actual controllers. Obviously for PS1/PS2 games I will be using a PS3 controller, I really don't mind that at all.

I'm just looking for the best option for each system.  I was looking around and I'd see things like some adapters for the GameCube couldn't register how hard you were pressing down on the triggers and things like that, which could be a problem in some games (SSBM I'm looking at you).

* It would need to support 4 players.
* It would need to support switching games etc with just controllers - no keyboard or mouse necessary. The UI doesn't have to be gorgeous, just functional.
* It would be semi-portable to take on holidays/friend's houses

The hardware candidates I already have are:

* Xbox Original with a failed softmod (HDD is unlocked so won't boot - not sure if fixable)
* Android set top box with dual core CPU
* Core 2 Duo E5200 powered desktop PC

I've tried PCSX-R and ePSXe, and both of them have the same problems. I've fiddled around with all the plugins enough to determine that the problem is with Pete's OpenGL driver, both 1 and 2 (using 1.78 and 2.9 repsectively).

Using P.E.Op.S. OpenGL 1.78 I have a problem with a weird corrupted image appearing right after the squaresoft logo and right before the opening credits, and also a problem with all cutscenes (or at least the cutscene you see when you start a new game, and the cutscene you see shortly after, didn't play farther than that) stuttering. I haven't played far enough to get to the first encounter, so I'm not sure if there's more problems than that.

With Pete's OpenGL2 driver, the entire game runs at 35 FPS no matter what settings I choose (so running it with graphical enhancements cranked up all the way, it runs just as fast as with everything set to the ""my computer is lame"" settings).

I just cannot figure out what's wrong with this. I haven't had this problem with any other game, and I'm fairly sure FF8 has been able to be emulated without these problems for years now.

My PC's specs are:

AMD Radeon HD 6570M

Intel i3 @ 3.2 GHZ

12 GB ram

I just updated to the latest beta drivers for my vid card, and still no improvement. I think maybe the problem lies in the way AMD cards handle openGL?

Anyone have any ideas on how to solve this? I've scoured the internet, and so far every posting I see with ""These are the perfect settings for FF8!"" hasn't fixed anything for me.

I'm Karen (angelXwind), that person who sinks into hiding holes on this subreddit, and runs her own repo at http://cydia.angelxwind.net/ .

If you installed Ingress, PPSSPP, and/or nds4ios, you have my repo added (or a certain piracy repo that mirrors my packages...)

Recently, I updated the versioning scheme used on my repo to a format compliant with the new dpkg update, which now requires that the version string begins with a number.

This, as a result, has broken updates to some of my Cydia packages for a number of people.

It's easy to fix, simply remove the package, then reinstall it.

**How do you tell if it's broken?**

Cydia will mark the package as being from ""Unknown / Local"" and there will be no Modify button, only a Remove button.

Simply remove and install, and it'll fix itself.

These packages are known to be affected:

* PPSSPP (Stable)
* PPSSPP (Testing)
* Ingress (Testing)
* nds4ios (Stable)
* nds4ios (Testing)
* nds4ios (iOS 5)
* iSwipe
* Cydiaの日本語化
* Cydia的简体中文版
* Cydia的繁體中文版
* Even if it is not listed here, check anyway.

Sorry for any inconvenience this may have caused, it was an unexpected consequence of updating the version scheme.

i5 2500k, AMD Radeon 7970 HD, 64 bit, 16 gigs ram


    Emulator and version (Have you tried the latest version or a different emulator?)

Multiple Emulators, PPSSPP, JSCPP (i think thats the spelling)

    Emulator settings (Have you tried different settings?)

Yes, will detail below

    Game details, like ROM/ISO information (Have you tried a different version?)

Final Fantasy I 


    Error messages (Have you tried searching on Google?)

Yes... lead to even more of a cluster fuck. 


Detailed of what happened.

Using JCSPP, I like it in particular, latest build iirc. It utilizes my ps3 controller well (I can not figure out how to run PPSSPP for my controller and etc.)

I am getting no game music, (I also was getting blurred lines, boosting the speed to 150% cleared that easily) (no MUSIC either option, game sounds such as clicks are present).

I find out through various places on the internet that it requires a program called Sonic Stage...


I think, no big deal. Ill download it.

The Program is discontinued and cant be downloaded. 

Then I find the official mirror for an offline downloader.... yup thats down too.

I am not a guy thats particularly good or willing to mess with this for days on end. I am just a guy looking to emulate Final Fantasy 1/2/3/4 when I get some free time. (A mostly configured emulator or a really step by step guide could really get me going, It doesn't have to be any particular emulator... I just want it to work so I can start my FF marathon)

People tell me (and did so as well on the thread I mentioned) to use ePSXe. Ok. Last time I checked...

* for some reason the analog stick would start turned off even in games that support it. My emulation rig won't have a keyboard, so it will be a bit difficult to enable the analog stick on it (it uses the F5 key)

I'm looking into what's best for PlayStation emulation nowadays. And little did I know the situation is even worse than N64 emulation! I really need the help of someone who's experienced with it. Can someone recommend me the best one?

ePSXe: I've got it working with reliable plugins, and I can live with not being able to change settings on the fly. The (only) problem is... why can't the analog stick be enabled by default?!

I don't understand why it can't be enabled by default like in the other emulators... At least let me bind it to a gamepad button, then.

pSX: Seems barebones compared to the others and lacks lots of configs. I've had some compatibility issues with it. Also, it seems to have problems reading BIN/CUE files. To make matters weirder, it seems to output a weird picture size that's neither 7:8 or 4:3 and I can't find any config options to change that...

Everything seems to be in order, and I have played a little bit of a few games to make sure they work.

I was wanting to take the data from my ps2 memory cards and use those to play my games, as I've had them for a long time and want to be able to use the same data without having to restart.

Problem is, after several hours on google and different forums, I'm just kinda tired and really overwhelmed. I've seen a few videos and read a lot of really, really short tutorials on a general idea on how to do it, but the main issue is actually getting the ps2 save data to my computer. From there, I should be able to use [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbYTqwtpEI0) to get the data into the emulator.

I've read that I need SwapMagic, or a modded ps2, and I can use a USB thumbdrive or a crossover cable to get the data over LAN.

A few years ago I bought a game called ""Metal Arms: Glitch in the System"" and it quickly became my favorite game of all time.

Fast forward to today and I'm having a nostalgia trip. So I decide to search the Internet dry for builds of the game and I end up with all three versions of it on my harddrive (Xbox, PS2 and GC). Needless to say, Xbox emulators aren't really reliable, PS2 emulators I still can't figure out, but then there's Dolphin.

I actually managed to hook up my Xbox360 controller to work with Dolphin so the program works. I've even managed to get the game working... sort of.

It shows me the title screen. It sounds exactly as I remember it and it also look exactly as I remember it. But there's a problem. Whenever I start a game, the screen goes black. The sounds are there but there's no image. Whenever I resize the window however, the image reappears, but freezes. Like it only updates the image when I force it to.

This is quite annoying. I'd *love* for this to work. I'm so damn close to re-living my favorite game of all time... but the program is mocking me!

I figure you want information about my specs, OS, Dolphin version and so on, so here goes:
