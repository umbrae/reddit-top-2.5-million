1367179822.0,610,self.asmr,1dagb3,"Suggestion: Remove AIHO/""head orgasms"" from the sidebar. [meta?]",739,129,95,http://www.reddit.com/r/asmr/comments/1dagb3/suggestion_remove_aihohead_orgasms_from_the/,"**EDIT2:** [MrStonedOne has replied and the sidebar has been updated.](http://www.reddit.com/r/asmr/comments/1dagb3/suggestion_remove_aihohead_orgasms_from_the/c9qcoly) The new sidebar text is as follows:
&gt;Also known as : AIE (Attention induced euphoria), or simply ""head tingles"".
This is sometimes referred to as head orgasms, but this is about as sexual as saying eating chocolate is orgasmic, (in that its not sexual).

Again, thanks everyone for their feedback and MrStonedOne for making the change. 

**EDIT:** Thanks for all the feedback, everyone. I vaguely recall the previous time this conversation was had, but I didn't remember anything being done. It would be awesome if we could get a mod response on this, especially considering this is currently the top post in the subreddit and apparently no one did anything about this last time. This seems to be something the subreddit cares about as a whole, so even if this gets ignored, I'm willing to bet it'll resurface again. 

Now, I'll open up by saying that this is a bit of a nitpick thing, but I was curious about how others in the subreddit feel about it.

I frequently visit this subreddit and one thing that has somewhat bothered me since becoming familiar with ASMR is a particular description of the sensation in the sidebar:

&gt; Also known as : AIHO (Attention induced head orgasm), AIE (Attention induced euphoria), or simply ""head orgasms""/""head tingles"".

The sidebar is typically where I would assume most people go when they are exploring a new subreddit that isn't particularly run-of-the-mill, which is the primary reason I think it would be a good idea to change/remove the quoted text. 

While anyone who has explored ASMR a bit would know that the sensation isn't (for most) a sexual sensation, the text above can be somewhat misleading and may give the wrong impression. I think the community has noticed the teasing of ASMRtists on Youtube, as well as the confusion from those who don't experience it. If we were to remove/change the text above, I think it would be a step (albeit small) toward clearing things up.

Additionally, the text doesn't seem particularly relevant anymore. It feels dated, as the terms mentioned are not in wide use. Maybe I'm not looking in the right places, but when searching for ""AIHO"" and ""AIE"" in Google, I only got one relevant result (it was Urban Dictionary). 

Ultimately, I realize it's a small detail, but I think removing or editing the sidebar text would be a step in clearing up to others what ASMR is all about. 

TL;DR: No one calls it AIHO or AIE. Saying they're ""orgasms"" helps perpetuate the misconception that ASMR is sexual. ",,False,self,t5_2sbyc,1367425699.0,,,True,t3_1dagb3,http://www.reddit.com/r/asmr/comments/1dagb3/suggestion_remove_aihohead_orgasms_from_the/,

EDIT: Wow, what a response. So here's the question: Could our childhood experience of this have any baring on our ability to experience ASMR? Could it have developed/enhanced a certain sense of touch?

1356024139.0,558,self.asmr,156bvt,Hi /r/ASMR.  I am a sound designer and I did some research on ASMR speech.  I found some pretty astounding stuff. ,641,83,96,http://www.reddit.com/r/asmr/comments/156bvt/hi_rasmr_i_am_a_sound_designer_and_i_did_some/,"[I did a podcast on the results if you want to listen](https://soundcloud.com/ashellinthepit/alone-in-the-cave-ep-47-what).

I just found out about ASMR a few days ago, though I've experienced it my whole life.  I was really surprised by the lack of data on it of any kind, so I decided to do some of my own--I'm a sound designer, not a scientist, but I have audio tools and an OK grasp on the scientific method so I thought I'd take a crack at it.  

Here is what I did:

I took 5 samples of ASMR speech [Bob Ross](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9sJ4NAugxg), [VeniVidiVulpes](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuEDMwMagsk), [Nena61090](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3HsmV0nQGk), [AppreciateASMR](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pclezy71o9M), and [GentleWhispering](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVpfHgC3ye0)

I selected a random 2 minute chunk from the audio of each video and then analyzed the length of each phrase and each pause.  For contrast I then did the same with [Bill O'Reilly and Geraldo having hissy fits](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3U9ENaTPLY) and for control I measured the cadence of [Dan Ariely giving a speech on social economics](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X68dm92HVI). 

The results were very surprising.  [You can check out the data here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AjfRW9SNkEWKdGliSjFTV04zQW9WWFppTEI4NW1CM0E#gid=0).  Please note I am not a spreadsheet master by any means.

Notable results: 

**ASMR Speakers have uncannily similar pause:speech ratios.**  After I summed up the pauses, 3 of the 5 samples were pausing for 49% of the two minutes--the sum total of pauses for these three being within 0.7 seconds of one another (59.05-59.75 seconds). **On average, ASMR speakers are pausing 48.28 percent of the time.** Bill O'Reilly and Geraldo Rivera fighting only pause 5% of the time, and Dan Ariely only pauses 16% of the time.  Also, **the average length of pause for *all 5* ASMR samples fell between 1.16 and 1.6 seconds**. Billy O and Geraldo: 0.19 seconds.  Dan Ariely: 0.42.  

**ASMR speakers use short phrases**, once again the average length of each spoken phrase used by an ASMR speaker is strikingly similar.  Of the 5 samples, the average phrase length varied from 1.24 seconds to 1.77 seconds, a difference of only half a second.  **The average phrase length of three of the samples were virtually identical**.  I realize a half second can be a big deal in some situations, but compared to Bill O'Reilly (4.7 seconds) the tight grouping is interesting.  

These were the things that popped out most to me.  I would love to do a frequency and amplitude based analysis as well, as I think the relationships between those two over time are very important, but due to the vastly different recording situations for each sample it simply wasn't possible with my tools/skills.  

Hope this helps any of those trying to become ASMR practitioners of some kind--I plan on using the data to add ASMR qualities to sounds I design.  I'd love to hear what other, smarter people could do with my data or techniques.  What do you think?

1335352296.0,361,self.asmr,srlfv,On why this subreddit is failing,510,149,146,http://www.reddit.com/r/asmr/comments/srlfv/on_why_this_subreddit_is_failing/,"*EDIT 2) I just found out a cause of some of the confusion: Many mobile users have never read the side bar! Always read the side bar! Many of the problems with this subreddit could be solved if everyone simply read it.
EDIT 1) I am referring to the people who blatantly state in the comments (eg OP says: ""I don't really get the tingles, but the video is just so relaxing!"") that they are not triggering and are posting/voting because they find it relaxing. (The comments were gone when I got back from class today, so I can't prove anything, but I'm sure others saw them.)

I suggest reading the whole post before commenting, ""Buthurt complaint thread again, I'm leaving ASMR!"" or ""You're wrong because of X!"" because 1-previously unmade arguments have been brought up, so this isn't a complaint rant and 2- Chances are, your argument was refuted in an area that you skimmed.* 

First off, this subreddit has kind of fallen appart, as it's no longer a community for ASMR videos but for relaxing ones. Yes, many videos serve both purposes, but that's not the issue. It's the people who actively upvote and post videos to relax that they don't get ASMR from. In addition, less common ASMR triggers are being called frisson triggers more and more. This is getting super annoying for me as a person who frequents both [/r/asmr](/r/asmr)  and [/r/Frisson](/r/Frisson). Frisson, by definition, is at it's base an emotion (not necessarily sensation), and very different from ASMR. Don't just send all the unwanted content to frisson, especially if you don't know what it is!


So, how do we fix this derailing train? Here's my suggestion:
Allow downvotes again. 
When they were disabled, there were only a few thousand subscribers here, so the disabling DVs was probably a good idea at the time. We have 15000 readers now. Good content is no longer surfacing well, and I'm not talking about my own triggers. After speaking to my friends, they have agreed that the content has been very hit and miss. There is no perfect system, but I think Reddit's system should be used because A) this is Reddit, not Onlyupvotesland B)The reddit algorithm is intended for large reddits, and should do a better job of pushing new/good posts to the front page than disallowing down voting. It uses the downvotes,

As ofd25 says below (and you should upvote them)
Videos that most would considering soothing and relaxing, like the OP stated, are being upvoted by people who aren't necessarily triggering from them. The result is a front page flooded with videos that do not provide a trigger to the community at large. One could argue that there may be a 100 people or so who do trigger from one of these videos (or whatever the amount of upvotes is) but does that make it worthy of the front page in a subreddit of over 10,000? We need the ability to filter stuff like that out because as it is, only allowing a video to be upvoted enables it to shoot straight to the top. 

Not down voting has not lead to better content making it to the front pages, which is what the goal is. We're at the point we need to be thinking of the benefit of the many, not the few. 


Let's be honest here: If we could downvote tagless things, reposts and just plain bad quality videos you mods would have a lot less work. So seriously, why not give it a shot for a month? You can always switch it back!



TL;DR, New folks need to educate themselves, all folks need to stop sending everyone to frisson, the subreddit worked better before, and disallowing downvotes hasn't made any less common triggers surface regularly. With regular complaint threads that are regularly upvoted more than the actual content in this subreddit, and many of it's subscribers unhappyit's time to change something. 

Side note: Don't tell people something isn't a trigger just because you've never heard of it being one, because you simply don't know what the other person is experiencing or even what causes ASMR! A person who triggers to pictures of deep space probably wonders why a person can trigger to videos of a girl scratching a loofah, so just because it's foreign to you doesn't make it wrong. You can get it from pictures, gifs, videos, music and real life. Literally anything everything is fair game! 

Also side note for my own agenda: Why can't we post musical asmr again? I really don't think that it's easy to confuse the two, because again, asmr seems to be more relaxing and tingly, and frisson has a powerful surge of intense emotion that often gives you goosebumps. To me, they're very different and I feel like I'm missing out on a lot of good content because music is banned. I'm curious how many more music triggerers there are and if we should un-ban it or start a music asmr. subreddit.",,False,self,t5_2sbyc,True,,,True,t3_srlfv,http://www.reddit.com/r/asmr/comments/srlfv/on_why_this_subreddit_is_failing/,

I love watching role play videos because they're so immersive, which helps with the tingles, but certain asmrtists pull me out of the immersion by commenting on the appearance of the audience, or things to that effect. For example, when watching a doctors office RP I don't want the asmrtist to spell out a random surname, or tell me my adress (which will obviously be wrong). It's better to leave things like this out, and make it more accessible to everyone. If you're doing a haircut roleplay, don't comment on my lovely blonde hair, or tell me that my brown eyes are gorgeous, because it's a bit offputting.

I mean this in the nicest possible way, I'm only trying to help out, and I'm sure there's a few people who agree with me!

From what I can tell, one particular person has been harassing her and flagging her videos as inappropriate because they think that her asmr videos are 'sexual' in nature. From what Monique has said herself, before her account was banned, this guy had been messaging her directly and threatening to report her.

The girl is 17 and lives in Canada. She mainly does whisper / ramble / eating videos, of which none violate the Youtube code of conduct. She has done a couple of *smoking* videos, which would be legal for her in Canada but apparently not in the US.

I'm very sad, as she was one of my favourite whisperers. Does anyone know how to contact the youtube mods? There are a whole lot of options to report someone, but nothing to appeal unless it's your own channel. I feel that I should stick up for her, and if anyone else is a fan I feel that you should too.

The solution I found is quite simple. In stead of turning the sound up, I turned it down. My brain is now so focussed on trying to make sence of the sounds and trying to understand words being spoken that I'm super focussed and don't have the time to think about anything other than the video at hand.

It's actually a reoccurring joke that my friends make that I have a brain tumor. I'm not really expecting them to understand the feeling, but it would be better if I kept in touch with someone in person with the same experiences. This may be a little bit of a rant, but I feel like I'm not the only one with these problems. The sexual problem is starting to irritate me as well. Because, as most of you have experienced on YouTube comments or in real life, there seems to be a huge misunderstanding with the feelings associated with asmr and sexual or ""orgasmic"" feelings. I know in some cases, asmr can affect people sexually, but so can pretty much anything else depending on the person. Does anyone have an explanation that can define asmr while also clearing up any misinterpretations between orgasms and tingles?

TL;DR: I can't carry out serious discussions about asmr with anyone I know. And, are there good ways to distinguish tingles from sexual orgasms to better educate the non-asmr community?

I was finding it especially hard to locate these videos with my very limited knowledge of the language, especially written Kanji, Katakana, etc. But I have recently discovered these characters 音フェチ translate as ""sound fetish"" in Japanese. Searching YouTube with those characters reveals a whole world of Japanese ASMR videos!!

Additionally, these characters 囁く are the best translation for ""whisper"" I have found, and can be added to the ""sound fetish"" characters.

Also, a very basic translation for ""Makeup"" is メイク or ""Meiku"" in Japanese.

Some of the Japanese videos do have ""ASMR"" in their titles along with their Japanese text, but because most of them have very low view-counts, they're tough to find.

If anyone has any better translations, or other info, feel free to add. Google translate is terrible for Japanese.

Since finding this subreddit, I've noticed something - while I do get very mild ASMR from some of these videos, my ASMR trigger is definitely PERSONAL attention. But the videos, even the ""personal attention"" ones, don't really trigger my ASMR. Why? Because I know it's not ""real."" It doesn't matter that it's a video versus real life, the reason it doesn't trigger is because I know it wasn't actually ""for me.""

In other words, a video of a card trick won't trigger ASMR, but a videochat of someone showing me a live card trick will, because i know it's real, and it's actually for me.

Don't get me wrong, some girls are truly good at making videos and are indeed very pretty too, nothing wrong with that. But quite a lot of them seem to fake and ""act"" a lot, purposely talking about sad personal stuff, using certain camera angles (sometimes showing just a lot of cleavage and acting upset and surprised when they get comments on that), wearing thick layers of make up and revealing outfits, (suggestive words even) and though there's nothing wrong with that either, it does distract from the good tingles for me personally and it seems to fill up my search results more and more.

Even some of the genuine girls seem to go in that direction when they get more popular, not to mention the ones that get all their drama out in public and get upset when they get feedback on that too. I love that there is still a bunch of good Youtubers out there, but a big part of the community seems to turn into pretty girls copying each other endlessly trying to get attention. And it's making it harder to find the good stuff when you sift through hundreds of girls with lots of make up and cleavage wanting to give you facials. Some are still giving me tingles because they have a great voice and make good quality videos, but it kind of feels like finding tons of reply-girls, though maybe not THAT annoying.

I'm happy to have found this subreddit though, there's some genuinely good stuff on here and lots of unintentional things (that I'd normally never find or maybe stumble upon once a year) which is great, but I do miss finding some good intentional stuff on my own lately.
Anyway I hope I'm not the only one, but even if I am, it's good to get this off my chest (no cleavage ;-) )",,False,self,t5_2sbyc,False,,,True,t3_wzxod,http://www.reddit.com/r/asmr/comments/wzxod/anyone_else_getting_a_bit_annoyed_with_the/,

Exporting is going very slow, so they'll be uploaded to youtube sometime tomorrow afternoonish I'm thinking. Speaking of tomorrow, I have recording present wrapping and possibly baking, and rain from within a car, on my recording list. Not sure if baking will make it, we'll see. This has been a thoroughly enjoyable, thank you for your participation! Please leave comments either here or on the youtube pages on if they trigger for you.

They were speaking soft, whispered Spanish for twenty minutes straight.

im sorry to say that i dont care for whisperers. i find the videos to be awkward and i dont really get tingles from them. but a lot of the front page is whisperers and i thought it might be nice to have a subreddit devoted to unintentional ASMR. bob ross, mr rogers, rrcherrypie, robert krampf, and all that good stuff.

EDIT: this isnt meant to splinter the community. it is already too big to be affected by a niche subreddit anyway. there are a bunch of great videos already and things are going exactly as i hoped they would. sorry to anyone who is offended by this, but i am happy that some of you share my point of view and i hope that we can make something awesome out of this sub

EDIT AGAIN: i dont have a problem with the mods. i like to give them the benefit of the doubt because it is probably hard as fuck keeping 15k people happy. i use this sub to help me fall asleep and the percentage of content that actually worked for me was declining so i thought maybe others would feel the same way.",,False,self,t5_2sbyc,True,,,True,t3_svzn9,http://www.reddit.com/r/asmr/comments/svzn9/i_made_a_subreddit_devoted_to_unintentional_asmr/,

I remember one of my most powerful asmr experiences was  in high school when a substitute teacher quietly came up behind my desk. I heard her breathing softly as she watched over me while I was busy writing the essay she had assigned us. Then she unexpectedly patted me on my back for good behavior before leaving. 

The experience lasted 5 minutes but the asmr it produced gave me a high for the rest of the day and I could recreate it again and again just by thinking about it. Even now, after almost 8 years if I think hard enough, I could trigger a weaker version of the feeling.

These videos are pleasant but they don't  seem to produce that intense almost full body orgasm like effect and I think it's because I'm anticipating it.

It is very difficult to put into words, but here is my attempt. I  will give you the play by play of my most recent asmr experience. 

I was at work sitting at my desk lost in a daydream about something that made me happy (cant remember what exactly). I had slept well the night before, so my body felt rested and strong with none of my usual aches and pains. I was the only person in the room, so it was very quiet. 

An elderly lady came into the office, moving slowly and with measured steps. She looked up from her phone and let out a barely audible ""hello"" with just a hint of a smack from her lips parting. From that point on I found myself moving and speaking in the same tone and manner as my guest. It had begun.

She walked over to my desk and sat down. Again, moving delicately but with purpose, she opened her purse and began methodically opening plastic sandwich bags containing her checkbook, pen, and several small bags of cash (small bills). I heard every rustle of the bags and the soft scratching of her fingertips as she brushed the cloth lining of her purse in search of her coin bag. The coins jingled as she pulled the bag free of her makeup case. (contented sigh)

She clicked her pen. I melted. She began writing out a check using smooth strokes, her lips smacking softly as she concentrated. I melted some more. Things slowed down. Every sound, every movement was carefully observed and duly noted. I entered a mild catatonic state. My eyelids became heavy. My breathing slowed. Everything slowed. 

When she finally finished filling out the check, she cautiously tore it along the perferated edge, gave it one last glance, and reached out to hand it to me. I responded by reaching for it at half speed and with the utmost care. As I took it from her, she softly asked if I would please cash the check for her, as she had some bills that needed paying. I was a ball of goo at this point, but I managed to respond with a low, curteous ""sure"" and asked how much she needed.

She smiled a wry smile, smacked her lips, and said, ""I need about tree fiddy."" That's when I noticed she was an eight story tall crustacean from the paleolithic era. 

So if you can relate to that story, you may be one of the few people lucky enough to experience asmr. Thanks for reading. ",,False,self,t5_2sbyc,False,,,True,t3_thhba,http://www.reddit.com/r/asmr/comments/thhba/this_is_my_attempt_at_explaining_how_asmr_feels/,

Let me make it clear that creating more niche subreddits like r/nsfwasmr is fine.  However, my gripe is that said niche content is being restricted so that it can *only* be posted in the niche subreddit, which not as many people will know about.**

I don't know when that rule was created, and maybe there was a vote and I missed it, but I think that it's a fairly silly idea.  It's consistent across Reddit that users have to mark NSFW links, and if we uphold that rule for this subreddit, why is there a problem?  I think creating a separate (potentially redundant) subreddit leads to less people being exposed to content overall, and even though there are many subscribers to this subreddit, I don't think the amount of content being submitted justifies a sub-subreddit.  There are only 90 people subscribed to r/nsfwasmr anyway, and there are barely any links.

I don't know about the rest of you, but I am in favor of allowing NSFW links in this main ASMR subreddit as long as they are marked as such.

**EDIT:** Of course, a subreddit specifically for nsfw triggers is fine by me.  Prohibiting NSFW links on the main ASMR subreddit is what I have a problem with.

I think yes.,157,44,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/asmr/comments/1eodgv/did_that_asmr_video_just_change_a_12_year_olds/,"So I'm a nanny for a 12 year old girl, and her parents often go out of town for a few days and I become the stand in parent while they're gone. This girl is extremely close to her parents and misses them tremendously while they are gone. Most nights after I say goodnight to her, she comes into my room crying saying she misses her parents. I usually just lay in bed with her and talk with her until she falls asleep when that happens. Last night we were talking and I told her about ASMR. She was very curious so I explained it to her. She eventually fell asleep while I talked about it and I figured that was that.

Tonight after saying goodnight, she came to me crying about missing her parents (they're coming home tomorrow) and she feels really sick on top of that. I laid next to her in bed and talked with her a bit, and then out of the blue she asked if I could show her an ASMR video. Of course I obliged and showed her [the haircut video from ViniVidiVulpes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2g9e2ner9sE). She said she liked to hear her lips smack together, and then I gave her some headphones. She immediately calmed down and closed her eyes.

She is presently passed out snoring with those headphones in and I am absolutely sure it just changed her life. I'm hoping this will be the end of her feeling sad and lonely at night when her parents are gone. Thank you to this amazing community!

Nothing is created yet, lets work off the sandbox for now otherwise it could get speedy deleted before we have time to make a substantial article. **But we have conformation that it would be allowed.**

##UPDATE2:

I gave us a base template to help with starting off. Feel free to edit, even if its just to test it or what not. ~~i~~ we can always undo your edits later if needed.

Be sure to keep it within the context of the sources. as in, talk about it as a cultural / Internet phenomenon, when describing it, talk about it from a third person view, as its discussed within the articles listen below. Later this weekend i'll give it some major work when i have the free time to do so.

***I need peoples to confirm that editing works. so make an edit just to test that.***

***

So there have been some articles about asmr on news sites. We ~~might~~ will be able to get our wikipedia article recreated.

But first. we need to work on a sandbox version of it. So i have created such a sandbox on my user account, it *should* (Can i get people to confirm this) be open to edit by anyone.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Kyleshome/sandbox/asmr &lt;--***SAND BOX***

please read the following wiki links to understand policy better so i have to do less editing when ~~(and if)~~ we get the recreation request approved and our ready to move it to a article.

But with many recent ones I realised that the sound is so extremely quiet that I have difficulties hearing anything. Even through a 600watt rms sound configuration, unless I turn it up very loud. But then there will be some super low frequency glitches (you can't hear with 90% of all headphones), because of which an extremely turned up sound system will literally send a little shock through the building.

So if you think your video might be having some of these problems, send me a private message with the audio track (or the complete video, though I would seperate the audio track) and I'll give it a quick fix :)

* very quiet volume
* strong (unwanted) variations in volume
* sudden loud sounds (e.q. dropping something off the shelf)
* unwanted clicks
* lower frequency ""blasts""

Binaural just happens to be a particular method of recording in stereo...

It it done using two omnidirectional microphone elements placed in the [ears of a human](http://i.imgur.com/CQmpL.jpg), a [dummy head](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dummy_head_recording), or using a [Jecklin disk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jecklin_Disk).  All of these recording methods are used to approximate how humans hear sound in real life, and is experienced properly by listening with headphones.

As far as other stereo methods, you have [A-B](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereophonic_sound#A-B_technique:_time-of-arrival_stereophony), [X-Y](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereophonic_sound#X-Y_technique:_intensity_stereophony), [Mid/Side](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereophonic_sound#M.2FS_technique:_Mid.2FSide_stereophony), [Near-coincident](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereophonic_sound#Near-coincident_technique:_mixed_stereophony), and other variations.  Cardioid, Omnidirectional, and figure-8 polar pattern microphone elements are typically used.

If you're using a portable compact field recorder with built in microphones to record the audio for your ASMR videos, you likely only have the following options... A-B, X-Y, ORTF, or M/S stereo recording methods.

****
I highly encourage that if your audio recording is not actually ""binaural,"" to update your video listing to note ""stereo,"" instead.  If it's binaural, then by all means, please label it as such... Also a good idea to note ""use headphones for best experience,"" or something like that...

****
Anywho, I thought I'd bring this up as I've come across a few ASMR performers that list their videos as such, but the recordings are not...

**Do we have any actual binaural ASMR recorders who would like to share, or do you know of any?**

This can be fixed very easily and will help you get very clear and nice sounds in your video.

First, download and install Audacity.
http://audacity.sourceforge.net/download/

Audacity is a free and open source audio editing program.


When you record your video, make sure that you record around 10 seconds in the beginning without moving the camera, saying or doing anything. This way we get 10 seconds of the static/background sound that we want to remove.


Now open up audacity and drag your video into the program. It will load the audio file from the video.
http://i.imgur.com/tezF0xz.jpg


Now go to the start of the video and zoom in so we can see the first 10 seconds easily. You zoom in by holding ctrl + up scroll.


Now mark the 10 second area (click and drag to mark). Make sure you only get the unwanted sound.
http://i.imgur.com/Vnuj5of.jpg


Now go to ""Effect"" from the top menu and choose ""noise removal""
http://i.imgur.com/Rw1HAfh.jpg


In the noise removal plugin, press ""get noise profile""

Then unmark the 10 second area by just clicking anywhere on the audio track.


Now go back to ""effect"" and ""noise removal"" again.
Make sure the settings look like this on ""step 2""
http://i.imgur.com/09en3mq.jpg

(You can play around with the settings to see what works best for you, but these standard settings should be just fine.)

Press ok. 

VOILA! That anoying static sound in your video is gone! 
press the play button to make sure everything sounds ok.

Now to save the file, press ""file"" then ""export"". Name your file and choose your file type of choice. I use mp3.

Open your video editing software, open your video, delete the sound and add the mp3 file you just created.


Hope this helps a few people. Feel free to ask questions if i was unclear about anything.",,False,self,t5_2sbyc,False,,,True,t3_1f51jl,http://www.reddit.com/r/asmr/comments/1f51jl/a_little_audio_help_for_you_asmr_artists/,

The personal attention you get in some of them makes me feel good beyond the typical relaxing ASMR sensation. Sometimes I think the reason I go back to certain videos is because I like being around that person and looking at them and listening to them. I don't get out and interact with people beyond hanging out with a couple of close friends now and then. Never had a girlfriend. Many ASMR videos, especially whisper ones, let you get really close to someone and can create a really intimate experience that is hard to find elsewhere.

In particular, a comment on a tapping video stating that it would be great if I had longer nails. I clicked on the username to see what they were all about, and BINGO - his feed was nothing but women's feet videos, and girls doing hand-based ASMR. (And a lot of those girls appeared to be under 18, which just brings it to a whole new level.) More recently, I uploaded a relaxing video of me working on my sewing machine... and somebody asked me to show my feet pushing the pedal. T_____T

Far be it from me to judge anyone for what gives them their jollies. But I did not make these videos with the intention of sexual gratification. Youtube is just not the kind of website you browse with one hand... I mean, ITS THE INTERNET. There's a website for that - probably several.

If you really, really want to jerk it to an ASMR video - whatever. But leaving a comment implying that you did so is straight up sexual harassment.

And I've seen comments on others' videos much, MUCH worse than what I've gotten. It is unfortunate, because the ASMR community is largely misunderstood to begin with - and these kinds of comments aren't helping.

I feel violated. I feel that the ASMR community is violated on a consistent basis. And there's no way to fight back. So do I just take down my videos? Or call out the creepers and shame them in the comments? Do I just have accept that there will always be someone out there who will jerk it to your video, whether you're putting up wallpaper or tapping on a book?

* Deleting gif images without the gif and asmr tag.

* Alerting mods via modmail when items get a lot of reports and need urgent attention.

* Removing memes and other image macro submissions. (In Progress, I'm learning what a 'meme' is.)

Anywho, I had some inquiries I wanted your input on:

-
**Should I be used to enforce a minimum level of tagging?**
-

As it stands, the meatbags tell me that tagging isn't *actually* required, just super **strongly** encouraged. So the real first question is, Should we make tagging required?

If so and I end up enforcing it, are there certain sets of tags that all posts should have at least one of? (like [Intentional] or [Unintentional])

Are there certain tags where if someone uses it, I should enforce that they also use at least one of another set of tags? (Like [Whisper] [Soft-spoken] [Accent] Also requiring [Male] or [Female] and [Accent] also requiring the type of accent.)

Now, I know that it probably sounds like a stupid question to ask here, but I thought it might be interesting to hear if anybody suffers from this?


I personally get huge ASMR tingles from tapping fingernails, speech and all the usual stuff, but when it comes to specifically the noise of someone chewing, eating or swallowing food it is a completely different thing. I start to panic, sweat, I feel rage boiling up inside me and I feel that sick like adrenaline feeling, and unless I either leave the room or vocalize my rage, it just does not go away, it is completely involuntary. What is funny is how specific the triggers are, most eating noises I'm fine with but there is a specific type of eating noise, the wet lip smacking with the jaw moving loads then the gulp (I'm starting to get agitated just thinking about it).

I just wondered if perhaps ASMR and this where in an way related? They sound like complete polar opposites.

**Edit:** Just to clarify, this is different to sounds that typically make you shudder or feel horrible in a bad way (commonly the sound of someone scratching a chalkboard or the sound of cotton wool).

I know Soothetube has a tagging system and I actually think it's organised well, but all of the content is moderated and approved by one(?) person and that just doesn't flow well, especially if you don't share their triggers.

](http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-205_162-57567105/why-do-animals-love-petting/) (btw cute picture of mouse being pet with a watercolor brush)

This is why mammals (and I guess they are finding birds as well) enjoy being stroked, caressed and touched gently. By synthesizing a chemical that activates MRGPRB4+, scientists were able to provoke a response in the neurons and observe a reaction- fewer signs of stress, leading researchers to believe the sensation was both calming and pleasurable.

Interestingly enough MRGPRB4+ [is not found in genetalia](http://takashi.mb.jhu.edu/Xinzhong%20Dong%20Papers/MrgprB4%20paper.pdf) (for all those jokers who mistake behaviors with sexual- it is related to the presence of hair and it is *speculated* this neron encourages grooming and bonding.

I propose a hypothesis that the chemicals that activate these neurons are released with the use of soft touch help produce a small amount of the ASMR experience. 

But this would maybe only account for a small portion of the calming and feel good effect, not the videos. There is more going on here obviously, but I thought it was pretty cool.

Two different things.

Frisson/chills is pretty common, and you can find a lot of info on it. One thing is clear : it's linked to the *dopamine* released in your brain. Usually triggered by music/emotionally intense moments.

* [BBC health](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-12135590)
* [Ars technica](http://arstechnica.com/science/news/2011/01/turns-out-that-music-really-is-intoxicating-after-all.ars)

ASMR, on the other hand, seems to be somewhat common but it's quite hard to find any documentation on the subject. But most people tend to associate it to *serotonin* release. Mostly triggered by close, personal attention, ambiant sounds, calming voices. 

* [Medhelp](http://www.medhelp.org/posts/Neurology/Tingly-Sensation-on-Back-of-Head-when-Happy/show/648570)
* [AMSR researh forum](http://www.asmr-research.org/forum/archive/index.php/thread-21.html)

While I believe it is possible to get ASMR from music, it's not the most common trigger, so that tingly feeling you get from music is most likely just a *frisson*.

(LINK REMOVED)


Update* It appears as if I am going to have to pull the survey soon. surveymonkey.com/ has only one monthly option and its $24 bucks (1000 results). I have no problem paying that but its 15 cents per result after that. I had no idea this survey was going to be so successful. We are at 920 responses and I am going to cap it at a 1000. I have only seen the data for the first hundred but after I upgrade give me a couple of hours and I will extrapolate it into a more usable form ( as some of you noted I only listed 3 triggers and a fill in the blank option so I will need to look it over). So keep taking it I am going to monitor it close and pull the link when I near 1k!!! 

Thanks ASRM Community.

Recently I've noticed a bit of passive aggressiveness from both sides regarding the types of videos posted.

For the record, I will hold my hands up and admit, I can't stand Intentional asmr. It doesn't work for me, thus I find it weird. However I feel it is important we stick together and are respectful towards each other's triggers. Admittedly, I myself have not followed that rule in the past.

We don't know what this thing is and it's great we've found a place where maybe we can figure it out together (eventually!).

So yeah that has been on my mind, maybe I've incorrectly read into things, maybe I'm way off the mark. However I thought it wouldn't hurt to raise the subject.

[your opinion] [thank-you gift inside],121,57,87,http://www.reddit.com/r/asmr/comments/1gp8oz/why_do_you_think_the_asmr_community_gets_so_much/,"Hiya everyone! I've been part of this subreddit for about a year, and I've noticed (as many of you have) that ASMR videos attract a surprising amount of hate, be it in video comments, hacking attempts, etc. I've been concerned with it for a while, but figured that's just how youtube works and let it be.

However, SophieASMR just recently disappeared, and I know a lot of you think it's because of the same hate I've described. Since most of my ASMR diet comes from this subreddit, she became one of my favorites, and I was frustrated, if not flat-out upset, that we lost her.

This has been a sad trend. Cutebunny992, MoniqueWhispers, Evgemiya Li (albeit only briefly, thankfully) -- they and many more have been casualties of hate and/or misrepresentation.

So I'd like to take a stand and write an article about it. To do that, I need to know why you think ASMR attracts this kind of negative attention. Is it because ASMRtists/ers are mostly female? Is it because people who don't get ASMR are predisposed to think it creepy? Are these sorts of things endemic to youtube and are by no means inordinately focused on the ASMR community (though I have doubts about this)?

[TheWaterwhispers has a pertinent video about this] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZZMn5lS2qw&amp;feature=youtu.be) and sgcollins makes good points [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TZdaqmz44M) and [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLJDveCFuck).

If I get the article published, I'll be sure to credit the individual users whose ideas I cite, and the subreddit as a whole. If I don't get it published, I still think this is a good forum as any to trade ideas and make our community even stronger. I know a couple threads along these lines have been posted in the past few months, but that just shows how urgent an issue this is. If hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people experience ASMR and don't know there's a name for it, I think the ASMR community could be an extremely powerful positive force if we could just understand how to let people know about it more effectively.

Oh, and as promised, [here's the intro to Stateless' ""Curtain Call""](http://www.tubechop.com/watch/1270115). It's not much, but it's all I got, since I haven't made any ASMR videos of my own. 

Thank you!  

**Edit**: 65 comments so far! I really appreciate it. Of course, some of those are mine...

Reading all the things you have to say has already given me a better perspective of this problem. So I'd like to synthesize what I've learned and what I'd like to refine:

**1)** Several of you have pointed out it's not so much a question of hate as it is of misrepresentation, creepiness, or just negativity in general. Perhaps it was misleading of me to only confine it to ""hate,"" but that was a buzzword a couple ASMRtists used to describe their problems, so I thought why the hell not, I'll use that word. You've shown me it's more complicated then people hatin': youtubers have myriad reasons for doing what they do, and examining the depth and breadth of those reasons would be interesting.

**2)** A couple of you have suggested I talk to ASMRtists directly and ask their opinions on this issue. This is a good idea, because not only do they probably have a better idea of what goes down in terms of negativity, it also gets the conversation started between the producers as well as the consumers. Besides, I'm not so much interested in why youtube is a wretched hive of scum and villainy (a dissertation in and of itself) as much as why ASMRtists/ers are constantly getting sniped.

**3)** Some of you have expressed interest in moving ASMRtists off of youtube. Do you think such a thing can be done? If so, where shall we move them? What are the consequences of that?

**4)** A very common answer is ""They condemn what they do not understand."" I get that some people don't get ASMR, but some of them do and still might not like it.

I have gone to sleep with her ""you have a cold"" vid almost every night for a month straight. I'm really really upset by this.

Apparently no one knows why she deleted her account, but I don't think it is too much of a stretch to say that it might have been the tsunami of trolling and hateful comments that seemingly every ASMR video generates on youtube.

I think now may be the time to develop some kind online guide to help new ASMR practitioners be better prepared to be successful and not be emtionaly terrorized by trolls.

I think that practitioners should be actively encouraged to consider always turning off comments on youtube if their entire purpose is to generate suggestions. Perhaps there can be a site where people can offer up general scenarios and suggestions that are both curated to weed out trolls and not tied to any specific practitioner. This way someone considering making a new video can simply visit and check out all the new ideas and be inspired without having to worry weeding through abusive comments.

I could also see it offering specific triggers, like fingernail tapping, soft talk, eye contact, or whatever.

Some practitioners clearly have no problem with the trolls--like me, they probably find it funny and dumb and just let it roll of their back. But for others I can only assume that the troll comments are legitimately hurtful and it would be good to have a system in place for these folks to still feel really connected but not have to deal with the negativity.

I think another option is to consider turning off the comments on videos, BUT linking to a personal ask.fm account. This way the practitioner can read the comments and questions, and respond to the ones he or she wants to. Some abusive comments would still be sent, but none of them would be publicly visible... and I think that is a huge part of the problem...

Anway I am rambling here; I just want to figure out how to do SOMETHING to provide the support for ASMR practitioners so they don't run screaming away from the internet...

Any one else have others ideas?

I am wondering if any of you guys are like me in that they experienced this with much more frequency when they were younger? 

When I was around like the age of 10 people who's voices would not normally induce asmr could very rarely cause it through certain phrases and I would be able to recall these phrases in my mind and experience asmr again with pretty much the same intensity as the original occurance. There was a sort of diminishing return when recalling phrases like this though and after a while they would sort of lose their potency. 

At age 20 though I experience asmr with less frequency and intensity and random phrases from people who wouldn't normally induce it don't seem to ever do it for me any more. I think perhaps an apt analogy would  be that it is like I have gained a tolerance to a drug after using it for a long time, it now takes a much more potent trigger to get the same results.
