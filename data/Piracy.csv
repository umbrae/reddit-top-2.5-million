Today, I opened it and there's a banner for ""featured torrents"" that won't go away, with a copy of them in the lower corner, which finally switched to ""Upgrade to uTorrent Plus"" when I managed to close them all.

This means it's time to ditch my client. What else is good?

**edit** I just noticed FB and twitter icons in the corner of the window too. What happened to no-bloat? uTorrent used to be great because it was tiny.

*****

**EDIT**

Compilation of suggestions, for those interested:

Just disable the stupid ad thing

&gt;Go to Options&gt;Preferences&gt;Advanced, find ""gui.show_plus_upsell"" and ""sponsored_torrent_offer_enabled,"" set false

*Or...*

1. Switch to [Deluge](http://deluge-torrent.org/)

2. Downgrade to [µtorrent version 2.0.4](http://www.oldapps.com/utorrent.php?old_utorrent=35).

3. Switch to [Transmission-qt](http://sourceforge.net/projects/trqtw/) (the windows port of [Transmission](http://www.transmissionbt.com/) client)

4. Switch to [qbittorrent](http://www.qbittorrent.org/)

5. Switch to [rtorrent](http://libtorrent.rakshasa.no/) (Not an option for me on Windows)

6. ~~Switch to [Vuze](http://www.vuze.com/)~~ because they didn't read the OP, or didn't know it used to be called Azureus

7. Use [I2P](http://www.i2p2.de/)

8. Downgrade to [µtorrent 2.2.1](http://www.oldapps.com/utorrent.php?old_utorrent=38) (Not sure what the benefits of downgrading to one version or the other are)

9. Switch to [Miro](http://www.getmiro.com/) (I'll pass, I have my own media players and I'm trying to cut bloat, but included in case others are interested)

Now I know this point is going to come up, so I'll address it too: Paying after the fact (because you liked the media) is also unfair. How are you to guarantee that the majority of people will be honest and actually pay for something""? Even if people were 100% honest, how could you define ""enjoyment""? Set the bar high enough and nobody has to pay for anything.

Give me your replies and I will listen and reply myself.

**EDIT:** For a post with so few upvotes, this sure has a lot of replies. I can't get to them all, but I'm working on it slowly. A lot of good points made. One or two bad ones. But I like the discussion.

**ONE MORE EDIT:** Forget that last edit. This got a large response. There's definitely some good points and some bad ones, but trying to respond to this is like trying to talk to sixty people at once. It's even harder since it requires digesting your comments and then formulating my own arguments. So I'm finished. Thanks for the replies anyway.

To give you an idea of how rare it is, it was only screened twice at film festivals in 2002. Disney then forbade its release and ordered copies of it destroyed. It's so hard to get a hold of that a Disney representative had to accompany a copy at all times during a rare screening at Pixar:

&gt; It seems that -- in mid-2002 -- the folks at Pixar Animation Studio wanted to hold a screening of ""The Sweatbox"" for all of the employees working at their Emeryville, CA. studio. So -- after a little negotiation -- Disney agreed to send a copy of the film up to Pixar ... provided that the print was always accompanied by a Disney studio representative.

&gt; And when I say ""always,"" I mean ""ALWAYS."" The story that I hear is that ""Monsters, Inc."" director Peter Docter actually offered to take the print's guardian down to Cafe Luxo for a quick bite to eat. The Disney studio representative refused, allegedly saying: ""If I ever let this copy of 'The Sweatbox' out of my sight, it could wind up costing me my job.""

So you can see how shocking it is that, two days ago, a 480p version was uploaded to YouTube. It far surpasses the quality of the previous bootlegged version, and is a direct transfer from a master VHS tape. It lasted two days and got 30,000 views before it was removed.

Re-uploading it to YouTube isn't an option, and with seizures of domains like MegaUpload, rampant anti-piracy measures at HotFile, RapidShare, etc., it'd only be a matter of time before it will be removed there. Fortunately, there's still a way for you to see it.

1. Download and install [I2P](http://www.i2p2.de/). I2P is an anonymous network. It lets you browse a darknet and share information without corporations like Disney dictating what you can and can't see.

2. Once I2P is running, open ""I2P Snark,"" which is a BitTorrent client. You can do so by clicking ""Torrents.""

3. Paste the following magnet URL into the ""From URL"" box under ""Add Torrent.""  This will indicate to the network that you want to download *The Sweatbox*:

    magnet:?xt=urn:btih:97a76d8e0acb341cbb8811e50a367b197fa9a8f7&amp;tr=http://tracker2.postman.i2p/announce.php

[screenshot](http://s18.postimage.org/khfmhustz/tmpscreenshot.jpg)

(If for some reason this doesn't work, you can click ""Postman"" to access that I2P BitTorrent tracker. Search for ""The Sweatbox"" there, or check the recent torrents.

4. Click ""Add torrent"" and wait. The page will refresh and indicate when the file starts downloading. 

*Edit* Be sure to push start!

I2P will be much slower than the regular Internet as your traffic has to bounce around peers in order to make it anonymous. You can help make the file faster for others by seeding it. Just let your computer and I2P run even after the file has downloaded. 

There are other ways to share files, such as The Piratebay and private BitTorrent trackers. These aren't anonymous, and private trackers don't allow just anybody to share information. You have to belong to a special club. 

The value of this documentary is so high, however, and the content so compelling, that hopefully you won't mind learning how to use a new, cutting edge, open, and truly anonymous technology. One day you too might depend on the anonymity that I2P provides.

***TL;DR/why should I care?***

**Synopsis -- or, why animators think it's kick-ass that this documentary suddenly surfaced two days ago:**

Similar to ""Waking Sleeping Beauty"", ""The Sweatbox"" offers a titillating glimpse into what it's like to work at an animation studio. Traditionally Disney has tried to present the appearance that their movies are created in a very flowing, ~~gentile~~ genteel manner (in keeping of the spirit of the ""old men"" of animation, and Disney himself), and have suppressed information to the contrary. This documentary really paved the way to dispelling that smokescreen.

Basically if you like film making, animation, or wonder what it's like to work on a project where hundreds of people are literally pouring their hearts and souls into a project that (should something go wrong) could crash and burn tomorrow, you'll probably enjoy it. The film starts out with an animator whispering that the producers hated the first version, and they're all upstairs in a story room discussing six different pitches for the future of the movie. He admits that they might actually decide to kill the movie outright (which isn't unprecedented in animation studios), which would mean, literally, that hundreds of people would lose their jobs just like that. These are artists who pore their heart and soul into their work, and it shows. At some point they (accurately) talk about how getting a character cut from the script is very similar to the feeling of losing a part of your life. Something you've literally spent years creating suddenly being worthless and lost, as if it died

You also get to see plenty of pencil tests, storyboards, interviews with the creators, and brainstorming meetings. Including one where they basically call in the most respected names in animation to try and brainstorm a way to save ""The Kingdom of the Sun"", the then-name for ""The Emperor's New Groove"".

It also has an aura of mystery around it, because it's basically shocking that THIS movie, which has been so rare and hard to obtain, suddenly surfaced in excellent quality! It's satisfying that, after ten years of Disney suppressing the film to the point of requiring its representatives to literally not let it out of their sight, it suddenly surfaces.

Edit:  Ok guys, I'm installing I2p now, and as soon as I get this torrent up and running, I'll post the link here.  I didn't expect this to be popular, so I'm going to spend a little time adding more ROMs and making sure you guys have lots of options in terms of plugins for your emulators and such.  Stay tuned, it's coming!

Edit2:  Ok, I've done some minor updates, and I'm trying to figure out how to get you guys the magnet link.

Edit3:  Ok, here is the magnet link:

And here is the "".torrent"" file link:

1)  It's bad, don't do it.

2)  I do it because *some innocent-seeming justification.*

I am of the belief that there is a third category.  One we often reference but to which few people claim membership:

3)  I pirate because I want stuff for free (and I don't care who I hurt to get it).

I am fairly confident that almost all pirates are actually part of the third category.  Nobody believes the justifications - they use them to defend themselves when they get called out in arguments, or as weapons to debate with on forums.  Deep down inside those people don't care, and although it's possible they may not realize it, I think most of them secretly do.

I'll admit I fall into this category.  My own gain comes before that of other people.  That isn't the kind of moral system that our society finds ideal, but I've never cared about that.  

I'm curious to know how many other people are willing to admit that the justifications are excuses, and that they pirate because they want stuff for free, consequences be damned.

*Edit:  I've gathered the information I was looking for, so thanks for your responses.

That way you don't have to bother fucking around with any cracks, mini images, etc. I'm trying to make them all as simplified as possible: run my installer, double click the shortcut to play the game. Pre-cracked, patched, with any available expansions, etc.

It's important to note that these would be optimized for a LAN multiplayer experience, NOT internet play since that's difficult or impossible with most pirated games. Also, some single player content may be missing in order to make the packages as small as possible for easy distribution. However, as much multiplayer content would be packed in as possible (DLC, expansions, etc.).

I've already done a few:

* Unreal Tournament 2K4,

* Age of Empires 2 + AoC,

* Dawn of War + Expansions,

* Supreme Commander,

* World in Conflict

I'm currently working on: 

* Portal 2 (Difficult to get around Steam)

* Company of Heroes

* Command and Conquer - Generals

* Star Wars Battlefront II

* Worms Reloaded OR Worms World Party (haven't decided)

**tl;dr: I'm making simple LAN-party optimized install packages for some games. Would anyone like me to share? Does anyone have any requests?**

Let's start out by saying I own two macs, one of them dead. I therefore don't think I should have to pay extra to get a copy of Mountain Lion to reinstall.

Apple apparently disagrees.

As a large and uncaring corporation, that is their prerogative, I suppose.

So I headed over to the bay and downloaded a copy of the App Store Mountain Lion installer, with the intention on using it with a Tonymacx86 tool called Unibeast to generate a flash drive I can use to install the OS on my desktop.

Well, I go through the process, and the installer quits, saying it encountered an error.

I dig through my system logs, and I see this gem:

    Jan 26 21:16:12 Skaia.local installd[3712]: ./preinstall:  
    Jan 26 21:16:12 Skaia.local installd[3712]: ./preinstall: Piracy attempt detected, no MAS receipt found, exiting
    Jan 26 21:16:12 Skaia.local installd[3712]: ./preinstall:  

I originally thought this was a new Apple check, so I take that error message verbatim to Google. Where I get led is the Tonymacx86 forums. Lots of people having install failures.

Their response is one that's obviously canned: ""Your copy of 'Install Mac OS Mountain Lion.app' is incomplete, redownload it from Apple"".

*Hmm*.  BS meter has been pegged.

So I crack open the Unibeast package myself, and rifle through the install scripts.

Sure enough, in the preinstaller:

    if hdiutil detach ""/Volumes/Mac OS X Install ESD/"" -force  -quiet $2&gt; /dev/null; then
            echo "" ""
            echo ""Piracy attempt detected, exiting"";
            echo "" ""
            exit 1
    elif [ ""$(file -b /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ Mountain\ Lion.app/Contents/_MASReceipt/receipt)"" != 'data' ];then
            echo "" ""
            echo ""Piracy attempt detected, no MAS receipt found, exiting"";
            echo "" ""
            exit 1
            elif ! grep -q com.apple.InstallAssistant.MountainLion /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ Mountain\ Lion.app/Contents/_MASReceipt/receipt ;then
    	        echo "" ""
                    echo ""Piracy attempt detected, invalid MAS receipt, exiting"";
    		echo "" ""
                    exit 1
    	else
    	cp /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ Mountain\ Lion.app/Contents/_MASReceipt/receipt ""${3}/.receipt""
    fi

Wow. Crude DRM in a tool which exists only to help break Apple's DRM. Hypocrisy, thy name is Tonymacx86.

Now, cleaning this crap out was a very simple matter.

Assuming you have a file called Unibeast.pkg sitting in your downloads folder:


    pkgutil --expand Unibeast.pkg Unibeast-tmp &amp;&amp; sed -i 27d Unibeast-tmp/multi.pkg/Scripts/preinstall &amp;&amp; pkgutil --flatten Unibeast-tmp Unibeast-fixed.pkg

..to extract the archive, delete the troublesome code, and repackage the archive.

Does anyone think there is really a difference between buying used games and pirating them? The creator will receive no compensation for their work but you will give money to a third party that is only interested in profiting. 

I actually think it may be worse in some regard. You now have a tangible item that can change hands for money completely outside of the control of the creator. You can buy and resell your used game with as many people as you want while the creator gets nothing. 

Now if you pirated the game you've simply taken advantage of the technology available to you and given nobody, aside from your ISP, monetary compensation for that ability. A pirated game is worth nothing, holds no value to anyone and will just as easily be deleted as it was downloaded. Nobody profits, nobody gains. 

To sum it up, if you exclusively buy used games then, in my opinion, you might as well be pirating it. What do you guys think?",,False,,t5_2qmox,False,,,True,t3_1cov56,http://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1cov56/used_games_vs_pirating/,

There are still a lot of publishers refusing to move to ebooks (but when they do, there's always DRM stripping!) so we must digitize them ourselves!

My plan is to make a huge catalog of books people would want and make sure they haven't been digitized. I'm not talking about the newest John Grisham novel, I'm talking about obscure books like William Faulkner's *Pylon*. Good luck finding that! Then using library books or buying them ourselves, scan them, and if you want to go the extra mile, OCRing them.

Say we have a 300 page novel. One person scans, and ten people proofread 30 pages. We could potentially finish a book a week. Some will be crappy, some will probably never be downloaded, but if you're a book lover like I am, you know they have to be given to them masses. 

Groups like Google Books are scanning books but not releasing them due to silly copyright laws. We should encourage anyone in these groups to leak as much as they can, saving a lot of effort.

1342344703.0,38,self.Piracy,wl6ju,What do you guys think of networking all of the Piracy and anonymity related subreddits? (details inside!),55,17,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/wl6ju/what_do_you_guys_think_of_networking_all_of_the/,"Lots of similar subreddits have begun subreddit networks. Examples include the [SFT Network](http://www.reddit.com/r/SingularityNetwork/) and the [SFW Porn Network](http://www.reddit.com/r/pornoverlords/faq). Basically all this does is take similar subreddits and add a unifying menu to their banners. I'm proposing the PFA Network (Piracy, Filesharing, Anonymity). I would seek admittance from the following subreddits:

/r/Piracy 
/r/BaconBits 
/r/TPB 
/r/cordcutters 
/r/torrents 
/r/trackers 
/r/Piratebox 
/r/Piratebox 
/r/Invites 
/r/seedboxes 
/r/filesharing 

/r/TorDay 
/r/onions 
/r/TOR 
/r/privacy 
/r/CryptoAnarchy 

All of these pages see lots of similiar content and cross-posts. The idea behind the networking would be to allow users to quickly find similar subs as the one they're exploring. The SFW Porn network has been hugely successful and all of those subs saw an increase in subscribers due to joining the network. There would also be a subreddit created (probably /r/PFANetwork) that would be dedicated to maintenance of the network and collaboration by the mods of individual subs.

There are some difficult decisions to be made as to the scope of the network... for instance, should we include cryptography related subs? What about darknet related subs? It all will really depend on the traffic this post gets.

I would appreciate posts linking to this one to any Subreddits of interest so we can get feedback from prominent users and mods as to whether this sounds like a good idea or not.

EDIT: created /r/PFAnetwork/ for interested mods to RSVP their subs for the network.",,False,,t5_2qmox,1342382561.0,,,True,t3_wl6ju,http://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/wl6ju/what_do_you_guys_think_of_networking_all_of_the/,

Media companies, here are some for you:

* Would you buy a car if the actual manufacturing costs made up only a tiny fraction of the price tag?

* Would you buy a car that is explicitly configured to be used only by a pre-defined selection of people and this is not subject to change?

* Would you buy a car that only moves if it is constantly connected to the manufacturer via an internet connection that *you* are responsible for?

* Would you buy a car if, to boot, all of these measures hurt the physical performace of the car?

Media companies have taken ownership rights away from buyers. If that sounds like a paradox, it's because it is. How do they expect respect when you're not really paying for a product as much as you're paying a product's price for *temporary permission* to use the product?

I have no problem paying for something, and I - evil, thieving pirate that I am - frequently purchase games that are sold without DRM and music from artists that have half their albums streaming in high quality on their websites anyway.

The truth for the big companies is that there is no appropriate analogy for use in their ads. Their business model is unprecedented and borders on self-parody. Their woes are of their own design.

It's back now, but the landlord says they're investigating with CenturyLink and the 'local authorities'. Pretty sure I'm the culprit.  Screwed, or scare tactic? ",46,10,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/z44fr/centurylink_shut_down_the_internet_in_my_building/,"Hi /r/piracy. I did something stupid, and I feel stupid. Feel free to mock me if you want. Also not sure if this is the right sub for this, so let me know if there is a more relevant one.

The Internet at my apartment complex went down starting on Monday night or Tuesday morning. It came back today, but the landlord left a note on the front door of the building stating that CenturyLink had shut down our connection due to 'unauthorized downloads'. The note says that the rental agency is investigating the issue with CenturyLink and the 'local authorities', and that all 'illegal downloading' activity should cease because the Internet connection might return before they find the IP address of the culprit.

Obviously, I strongly suspect that it was my downloads that caused this issue. I downloaded about 20 songs and six GoT episodes on Sunday and a movie about a week before that.

I was using utorrent 1.5.11 (25801) on my Mac to get these files. Outgoing encryption is enabled (not honestly sure if this does anything) and it is set to randomize port on launch. Not sure if this is relevant, but it might be. I think the router in the building is set to DHCP and I'm 90% sure I've had the same local IP address the whole time I've been here.

One last note... The connection was quite laggy before I downloaded anything, so I'm also considering the possibilty that there is another culprit. The timing seems a little too coincidental to me, though.

So I'm a little freaked and I'm wondering if I'm being paranoid.

How easy is it to trace this back to my computer? My guess is very, very easy.

What are the likely consequences?

Should I call my rental agency and admit guilt, promise not to do it again and hope for the best? I've been living here for about three weeks.

Generally, what do you think is the best course of action? Am I just being a paranoid little sissy? Because the torrent traffic was encrypted, is it possible that all CenturyLink knows is that I was using utorrent, but not what I was downloading? 

Let me know if there's anything I omitted that could be helpful, and thanks in advance.

Edit: My understanding is that usually ISPs will give a warning before shutting down your service. Was this the 'warning' because it wasn't a permanent shutdown? Does anyone know how CenturyLink (formerly Qwest) does this?

Edit 2: There are two other users on the network with many open sessions (&gt;50 for one, &gt;90 for another). I don't have a good idea of what this means, but could it indicate that I'm not the only person downloading a large amount of data?

Edit 3: I haven't downloaded anything since I saw the note, and I will use a VPN in the future. I'm more concerned if this can be traced directly to me, and if so, what the potential ramifications are.",,False,,t5_2qmox,False,,,True,t3_z44fr,http://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/z44fr/centurylink_shut_down_the_internet_in_my_building/,

Hi reddit! I created [this site](http://rss2torrent.tk) in order to give people an easy way to get up-to-date torrent downloads from any RSS feed, allowing people to automatically download new releases of their favourite shows, music, and movies. 

For example, [Pitchfork's Best New Albums feed](http://pitchfork.com/rss/reviews/best/albums/) could be turned into a [torrent enabled one](http://rss2torrent.tk/http://pitchfork.com/rss/reviews/best/albums/), or [new movie releases](http://rss2torrent.tk/http://dvd.netflix.com/NewReleasesRSS) could be automatically downloaded to your computer, maybe new episodes of your favourite show, or new magazine releases, and the possibilities go on.

If you haven't used the RSS feature in your torrent client, [here](http://torrentfreak.com/how-to-use-rss-bittorrent-to-download-tv-shows/) is a great article by TorrentFreak about it. Basically, as new items are added to the feed, they are downloaded to your computer. The feed, however, must contain links to the torrent files. That's where we come in: we take normal feeds, and add torrent files to them so they are ready to download.

Feeds can be created by going to [the site](http://rss2torrent.tk), or by adding a valid RSS feed to our URL, as shown below.

    http://rss2torrent.tk/(RSS URL)

For example. 

    http://rss2torrent.tk/http://pitchfork.com/rss/reviews/best/albums/

Just add that URL to your torrent client, and you're good to go. 

I'm currently hosting this on a free server, so I apologize if it's a bit slow. I'll pay for better hosting when I can afford it, but I'm currently working on paying for school. I also plan on releasing this as an open-source project when the code is cleaned up. I'm not asking for money or anything right now, but if you could try out my service and give me feedback, that'd be great!",,False,,t5_2qmox,False,,,True,t3_1gdrl1,http://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1gdrl1/rss2torrent_a_service_i_created_that_transforms/,

I occasionally go to the cinema. I've stopped pirating most music due to spotify, but **money is no longer an issue** for me, however I have still very little inclination to switch to legal channels due to:

* Time restrictions on availability and channels (not willing to wait 6 months to watch with adverts)
* Requiring accounts, registration and the going through payment processes (ecommerce carries risks)
* Concerns about the availability of streaming solutions (Netflix) and licence revocation (Amazon)
* Physical shops and media? Please...

However I would like to compensate the creators, without supporting distribution channels I have no intention of using, and do not **want** to support.

The problem is - you can't as far as I'm aware. It's easier to say 'thanks!' to a release group than it is to tip the creators a few quid directly for their efforts.

That's right, I've chosen AppCake as my new alternative to Installous. It's very similar to Installous in a lot of ways, so it's easy to get a hang of. It even has a few features that are even better than Installous, like a full browser so you can search Google for your IPA's if they aren't in AppCake's database.

I have Cablevision- it redirected to a walled-garden page informing me that the internet community is concerned by possible unauthorized activity on my account (Oh no! Thanks for your loving concern internet community!)  my connection might not be secure, it's surely not *me* pirating but I should remove any programs that might be pirate-y, etc. Click that I've read it and reset my modem and I'm back online. What I'm curious about now is if any one has any idea *how* they're sending these out. 

Like everyone else I've assumed that they'd be going for the public tracker crowd. But here's the thing- I haven't used BitTorrent for illegal downloading in over a year- maybe closer to two and used a private tracker at the time. I currently use SSL enabled Usenet.  The only thing I'm not using is a proxy/VPN (which I might invest in soonish since a year of some VPNs is cheaper then contesting a strike).

I have however, downloaded legal content with Utorrent in the last few days (large Skyrim mod and a couple of game patches).

So, what's the most likely scenario here? That they're basing the notice on activity two years in the past, sending the notice out in bulk to anyone that ever had a complaint against them? That they're basing it completely on volume (which was high-ish) without knowing what the  content is? Which doesn't make complete sense since I would think they would need a copyright complaint before sending me something- I can't imagine the ISPs care to do their own copyright detective work. That someone/program, somewhere is just looking at keywords and saw something with Skyrim in it and assumed it was copyrighted rather then fan-created? Deep packet inspection of Usenet traffic?

My thoughts are that if the university monitors p2p traffic, will see a big jump of encrypted p2p and investigate piracy, to which I can reply that I've only downloaded freeware, non-copyrighted materials, or public domain media.

I see a lot of movement in the direction of piracy via proxy services, but that takes money and technical knowledge that, while relatively small, is still more of a barrier than many have the commitment to overcome.

I believe in piracy; I think it makes the world a better place. There's a prevailing attitude that as long as it's still possible to make it over the fence if you know how, everything is fine, but there is still everyone that won't have that capacity, whether they're too young to have a credit card, unemployed, or just not very handy with computers. Those people matter too. It's saddening to see friends who don't quite know what's going on, but stop downloading because they're scared of retribution and don't know anything beyond that they can get the files they want by searching a website and clicking a few buttons.

My question is, what can we do? How can we work towards making piracy easy and safe for everyone?",,False,,t5_2qmox,False,,,True,t3_rz1b6,http://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/rz1b6/the_future_of_casual_piracy/,

Normally what I'd do is download it from torrents or some other method, and stream it directly to my ps3.  This morning however I decided that I didn't want to wait that long for the file to download so I figured I'd go over to Amazon and purchase the episode.  

$2.99 for the episode?  Sure why not.  I purchased it figuring that they treat videos the same as they treat their mp3s. IE: once you purchase them, they're your entirely and you can download them and do whatever the hell you want with them.  To do this you need to download some proprietary software from Amazon.  ""Ok"" fine.  I do that, download the file to my hard drive and go to stream it to my PS3.   ""Of course....why would that have worked?""  It clearly doesn't work becuase the file format has some sort of protection on it.

So now here I am..downloading a pirated file of the same episode so I can stream it to my tv without restrictions.
