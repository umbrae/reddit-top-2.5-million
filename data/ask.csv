Ideas? ,52,9,72,http://www.reddit.com/r/ask/comments/nbbzv/i_on_a_whim_bought_160_acres_of_land_in_canada/,"I had the idea of buying land for years to grow apples and make hard cider so I don't have buyers remorse. I found a government auction that sells foreclosed land and the 160 acres were going for only $1,200 down payment with financing. 

I can pay off the land but wouldn't be able to do much with it afterwards so I thought maybe make a [large fort](http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/united-states/Jamestown-fort.jpg) or treehouse from the nearby woods and try to amass a community of creative people. The area has no zoning so we are free to build or farm all the things.

the land is South of [Cochrane, Ontario](http://www.town.cochrane.on.ca/siteengine/activepage.asp)

I would only need around 30 acres to make all the cider I could ever want or sell and the fort would probably be 2.5 acres in all. so what do with rest of land???? 

I welcome ideas on what to do with the land, Anybody want to help out or live on the land PM me. 



------------------------

EDIT: More info on the land:

*With Crown land bordering all sides, this large recreational acreage is ideally suited to the outdoor enthusiast. This tract measures over 2640 feet or a ½ mile on each of its four sides!

*The overall terrain is mostly flat with no irregularities except for a small low lying area in the southeast quadrant that may hold water particularly in the spring time (after any snow melts).

*Although trees have been harvested over the past few years, remaining tree cover consists of Aspen poplar mixed with birch and balsam poplar. Plenty of regrowth on site attracts the attention of the local moose population as they are drawn to the protein in the younger vegetation.

*A half mile north is the majestic Abitibi River with hundreds of fish filled bays and coves to explore. Ten miles west the river empties into large Lake Abitibi, a well known walleye fishery.

Many years ago, I started getting laser hair removal treatments on my ""happy trail."" When my boyfriend at the time found out, he told me to stop, because he found my hairy stomach really sexy. (He was so-so on the nipple hair, but didn't find it gross.) He honestly, seriously did find my stomach attractive and sexually arousing, so I stopped getting the laser treatments.

We recently broke up. Now I'm single, and terrified of any other man seeing me naked, mostly because of my body hair.

To be clear, this isn't just a little bit of ""peach fuzz"" hair. It's thick, brown, wiry hair. Almost like pubic hair. On both the stomach and nipples. (Oh God this is so embarrassing.) I've tried waxing, shaving, and tweezing, but it never really works out, because the hair always grows back in as in-grown hairs, and becomes really red and bumpy, such that it actually looks worse than if I just left it alone. So my only real options are to permanently remove it, or just let it grow (*shudder*).

So should I go ahead with laser hair removal? Was my ex-boyfriend just a crazy weirdo who had a strange body hair fetish, or are there secretly a lot of men who like it, or at least don't mind it? If you brought a girl home, got her shirt off and saw nipple hair, would you freak out? Is it really as horrifying as I think it is? I would love some honest opinions.

TL;DR -- I'm a woman with body hair on my stomach and breasts, should I get it removed?

The images were from another year and a half earlier, when I was even younger. I've only been taken to court now I'm no longer a minor.

For the past 2/3 weeks I've been feeling the pressure of this, medical conditions I have have gotten worse, I've started suffering from extreme insomnia, and lots of other stuff. 
When my next court hearing takes place, it will be in a local newspaper which will alert everyone, friends and family, to my crime. My life won't be worth living.

I've cut myself for a while, started after the police took my computer, and has been my only real relief, but I stopped about 2 months ago... now I've started again. Only it isn't helping enough anymore, and I know I won't be able to cope with life when it comes out in the local newspaper. Twice before I came so close to suicide, but I was too scared. But now I don't see any alternative. When everyone on the planet thinks you're a sick, disgusting excuse for a human being and hates you with every breath in their body, what the fuck are you supposed to do?
I'm not even a paedophile, they're sick people. I had the images, but only because when I tried to get images of people my (then) own age, I was sent hoardes of other pictures as well... I was even pressured into taking naked pictures of myself, which means I'm getting done for making as well as possessing.

My life is over, or it certainly will be in a weeks time, so if anyone can see any alternative to suicice... well, could you share? I don't want to do this... but I don't see any other fucking choice.

Edit: mild typo corrections, cleaned up language

Good afternoon! Or whatever time it is where you are. Sorry this is LONG! Any help is appreciated. Also, throw away, of course.

So, first of all, back story. I live in Austin, Texas, USA. I work (as does my domestic partner) at a veterinary office part time. I have two dogs and a cat. I spend a lot of time with animals. I applied for this kennel tech job in May to try to pull extra income to eventually go back to school/pay off my cc's. At first I thought I blew my interview by mentioning my SO (I'm gay) but later I received a call back and was hired. I didn't do anything except fill out a tax form when I was hired. I didn't sign any contracts. There were no printed rules or codes of conduct given to me at any point during my employment there. During my time working there I noticed a lot of unsafe procedures concerning the animals and every time I brought them up I was ignored or dismissed. This, of course, made me increasingly mad. Only a month after working there I started contemplating quitting. 

**Here is the review I wrote and the letter I got:** http://imgur.com/a/pnzam

**Here is more explanation:**

The last few days I worked there a lot of shit went down. I had a few disagreements with the younger male manager there - we were both in bad moods, etc, but the last straw for me was when I found out a very old, very sick dog (on chronic soloxine (thyroid medication) and tramadol (pain meds)) was not only NOT given her AM medication during the morning shift as she should have been, she was left indoors in the kennel room, laying halfway out of a crate, with no a/c or water all afternoon (3pm to 7pm) while all the other dogs were out at play. (she ""snapped"" at the other kennel tech so they just didn't med or move her.) When they informed me about it and I went to get her she was not able to move or stand up on her own and was shaking, presumably in pain/discomfort. I carried her out into the office yard area and supported her back end to allow her to urinate and gave her her medications. The other staff informed me she hadn't been moving on her own or eating very much on her own at all. At that time I called the owner of the kennel and informed him I wasn't sure if she would live through the night and I thought she should be kept inside the office where the ""on site"" (younger male) manager lived and not with the other dogs in the loud kennel. Insert other convo/drama, but he informed me he had contacted the owner and the owner made arrangements for the dog's vet to come get her the next day and didn't think it was that big a deal but eventually conceded to letting her stay inside. I had the AM shift the next day. I stopped by my vet and picked up a can of a/d food for her ( [see here](http://www.hillspet.com/products/pd-feline-ad-caninefeline-critical-care-canned.html) ). When I got there I asked about her, if I could feed her and med her, but the manager didn't seem concerned, said she was resting and to leave her alone. We went out to the kennel to tend to the other dogs, at which point the manager and I had another heated disagreement. So, I disregarded what he said and asked the other (nice) manager to cover the yard for me while I went and gave sick dog her meds. At this point I was able to actually handle and read her medications and noticed she was also on 1.5 tabs of terbinafide (brand name: lamisil) once daily for the TREATMENT OF RINGWORM. This dog had be OUT IN PLAY GROUPS from the 19th-21st, with a CONTAGIOUS FUNGAL INFECTION. She was out there one of the days I had my dog there. I was PISSED! I sent the owner of the kennel a VERY curt/angry text (almost all of our communication was via text), and another one with colorful language about the manager who was being such an asshole to me. He said thanks for the info and that he'd be in later. I said great, I'd love to discuss things with you.

I was fired that morning for ""personality differences"" and ""failure to adhere to instruction."" Personality differences? Definitely.. * When I asked for an example of how I disregarded instructions, he couldn't give me one.. but whatever. I was so glad to be gone!

Fast forward to writing the review and receiving the lawyer letter.

**Here is what I have that may be legally useful:**
I have text messages between the owner and I, including one time where I asked if he or another manager had any problems with me/my performance and he assured me he did not. I have the texts I sent him on the day I was dismissed, including the ones concerning ringworm dog, and the (last) paystub he gave me that coincides with the dates.

I have text message logs with friends backing up my intention to resign as well as friends who would testify about my constant complaints about the safety procedures and desire to leave.

I have EXCELLENT previous/current employment references. This is the ONLY job I have ever been dismissed from.

I have probably up to three different veterinarians licensed to practice in Texas willing to write me letters to back up the conjecture in my review of the kennel.

**I do NOT have** official records of any of the things/pet check in sheets that went on in the kennel. I handled the animals, not the paperwork.

My mom is 57 years old, divorced, and in a rough spot in life.  9 years ago she was in a car accident, as she was pulling through an intersection, someone else was going on the road and T-Boned her.  When this happened it fucked up her neck, back, and brain. She has always suffered with depression / bi-polar, so some days she won't / can't even leave the house. I live ~400 miles from her, and my sister is &gt;1,000 miles so neither one of us are really able to help her aside from emotional support via the phone. All of the people my mom called friend before the accident slowly have started to desert her as she was no longer a 'convenient friend'. Because of her neck / head / back issues, she is on disability / unable to work. The constraints my mom deals with are as follows:

* Because of the car accident, she can't stand or walk for long periods of time (an hour is pushing it)
* Because of the car accident, she has a hard time processing information as quickly as some people.  She is smart, but given to much information to fast, it overloads her and she can't process it.
* Because of the diabetes, her feet get swollen and she has a difficult time standing / walking.
* When she gets nervous, she has a difficult time communicating
* She has terrible tremors in her hands / arms so working with small things is quite difficult (the Dr. thought she had Parkinson's however they found out it's just all of her medicines working against her. They can't take her off of them because they are for her depression  and a bunch of other things)
* She has a hard time hearing, 80% of the time she reads lips and just adds what she hears to that (she does have hearing aids, so that helps.)
* Her memory is not good anymore, she has a hard time recalling specifics
* General depression

As a result of all this, my mom sits at home all day watching TV / reading books (she likes to read).  She can't think of anything that she would like to do with her life, and it feels like she just sits waiting to die. She stays in the house because she has nothing to do, and since she is always in her house she gets sad and depressed and doesn't want to leave house causing an endless cycle. So, now the million dollar question, what can my mom do?  Things she enjoys:

* Reading, she has a kindle, but has a phobia of libraries / used books.  So she buys all of her books new / discount
* Drinking coffee
* Talking / being around people
* 'Making things'  She enjoys making things, but in general lacks the physical ability to do so
* Being creative

I say this not to sound like a sob story, but in attempt to get help for my mom.  I love her with all my heart and it breaks my soul to see her in such a state. So Please help me try to find a way to help her.

TL;DR
Mom is depressed and looking for something to do with her time, she was in an accident about 9 years ago which makes it so she can't work, and do much physical things.

* I have been paying off my parents house for the past 5 years (I bought out 1/3 to clear out their debts).
* My mum passed away, and at the time I learned that they had since got another 10K in debt through credit card purchases.
* For some crazy reason my dad - 6 months after mum passing - has decided to re-marry with a new woman (whom I suspect he was seeing over the past 3 years - he was too gutless to break up with mum 30 years ago and instead thinks he did the christian thing by being a right arsehole with her for the entire marriage).
* Although I do think my dad is a selfish arse, I also appreciate that it must have been tough to bring up 4 kids and have a wife who was always ill or somewhat handicapped (rhumetoid -- all major joints replaced). Hence why I have still tried to look after him and mum this whole time.
* My family is somewhat torn apart by recent events and they are trying their best to be cordial but I can see it is causing great pain.  I was really excited to hear dad was happy even if it was with a new woman, but I have started to see that perhaps I am being taken advantage of.
* I am concerned that my father has never really appreciated how much effort I put into paying off his house (I can't afford one myself, I pay $1000 per month on his!). And I found out yesterday that he told my sister I was only doing it as a tax dodge WTF?
* I am not happy with the thought that I put all this effort in for Mum and Dad only to have a complete stranger move in and take over - even if it is Dad's wishes.  I would feel a lot better if they moved to a new place and I could get out of my obligation to pay off the 1/3.

My mom is a single parent and has been since I was 10 years old. She never dated or had many interactions with other males while I was growing up, focusing instead on her job and raising me. But when I left the state for college, my mom started seeing this guy, Andrew. Soon after, they decided to get married and Andrew moved into my mom's place. 

The problem was that Andrew turned out to be a liar and a jobless leech. I don't really want to get into the details, but basically my mom wanted a divorce after he became physically and verbally abusive (threw things at her, ripped up her clothes, yelled at her). But even through she kicked him out, he continued to call her OVER AND OVER again, leaving really NASTY messages, to the point where my mom had to get a new phone number. He also harassed her in person, knocking on our door at odd hours of the night and yelling loudly to our neighbors that my mother was a bad person.

When that happened, my mom got a free lawyer, who advised her to get a restraining order placed on him so that he could no longer go near our house. She did.

That led him to start harassing her at her WORK. My mom works as a waitress in a restaurant. One day, he showed up to the restaurant, and told the owner that my mom was a bitch, and a lot of other nasty things. The owner didn't want him to come again, so my mom got fired. She went to the police to complain, but they told her that her restraining order was only valid for her house, and did not expand to her workplace.

Last month, my mom finally got a new job at another restaurant. Everything was going fine until yesterday, when he again showed up to the restaurant and started yelling, VERY LOUDLY, at all the waitresses, calling them ""whores"" and ""call girls"". The manager forced him out, and my mom had to explain the situation. Thankfully, the manager understood, but said that it couldn't happen again. So now, my mom is getting a restraining order filled out so that he can't come to her workplace, but now she is terrified that he is going to continue harassing her wherever she goes, and maybe even sneak into her house somehow. 

Is there anything I or she can do to make him stop? Is there any way I can get him arrested? :( This has really been going on for far too long. I want to do something about it and make him leave her alone, but i just have no idea what to do.

I thought that was gracious of her but declined for almost a year. Go figure I pick one up the day after we had the first serious  talk about marriage in the future. 

She's had feelings for other guys consistently since we started dating. I've always ignored any attraction to other girls and refused to dwell on it for fear of cheating.  But shes never acted upon her somewhat intense desires for these guys, always speaking with regret for feeling today way when shes with me and how they all had deal breaking flaws but were still hot.  Very little was written about  me at all.  What was written was almost always positive except for comments about my physical appearance and at one point dick size...kinda burned by that one but I knew I wasn't exactly massive.   

I could take that two ways,a compliment to who I am and as a hint to changes in my activity level (not exactly a washboard stomach but not overweight) nothing I can do about my junk yet, those procedures aren't proven yet. 

I don't know why she wanted me to read it unless she doesn't want to approach those subjects openly with me and I can understand that.

My biggest concern is how common is it to develop feelings for other people consistently while in a relationship and despite her not acting on them would it be reasonable to be a little insecure over the whole thing?

I've worked online for the last 8 years or so. I promote peoples websites and work on commission. Because of that, I don't pay my taxes throughout the year. I'm taxed as a 1099 Independent contractor.

In 2006, I made enough money working online that my tax liability to the IRS was roughly $14,000. Additionally, my tax liability to the state (Kentucky) was roughly $2500. I wrote them both a check and went on about my life.

In 2007 and 2008, I made substantially less money. Because of that, I was pretty broke come tax time. I foolishly filed an extention for both years, and never actually filed afterward.

Does anyone know of any reputable tax attorneys or CPAs that I could contact? I live in Louisville, KY if that helps.

Will I be able to file amended returns on the actual amount of income I made for those years and get the numbers lowered? Will I have to pay all of my penalties and interest?

Backstory:

So my wife of 1 year, but partner of 8 years, and mother of my 2 children have a great relationship and marriage.  We rarely fight, or get into disagreements, we have a very healthy and active sex life, and truly enjoy spending time with each other. 

I was raised in a very 'traditional' home where my father made all the important decisions/purchases.  My mom, although she was a full time teacher, took care of the home.  Did laundry on the weekends, cooked all meals except for bbq, and took care of the flowers.  My dad would take care of car maintenance, yard work &amp; other 'traditional' male chores.  There was never any talk about sex, or drugs or anything of any consequence.  It was more of a 'you should know what we expect out of you.  We'll tell you when we're happy, but you'll know when we're not.'  My sister and I were raised with an 'academics &amp; athletics' come first mentality.  My wife was raised by more of a 'hippy' style of parenting.  Not to say her parents were all about free love and such, but they smoked weed and were a lot more open about life.


About 6 months ago, one of my wife's friends(female), came down for the evening, and we ended up having a three-some.  Now, not to say I'm a prude, but I've only been with 2 females(my wife, and my first serious girlfriend/fiance) prior to this.  Although this was a guys dream come true, I didn't actually have sex with the friend.  Mainly because it wasn't talked about prior, also because I knew she was kind of seeing another guy so I didn't want to intrude into their relationship it that fashion(come to find out that my wife completely didn't mind and was surprised that I didn't)  Don't get me wrong, there was plenty of foreplay and such, just no insertion.  Since then, my wife and I have been having many healthy conversations about this sort of thing, mainly about a few other of her really close female friends that she would be interested in have join us.  


Jump to 2 Weeks ago:

My best friend's wife, whom lives a great distance from us with my bf and their 10mo old child, came down to visit for a couple weeks.  She was only at our place for a couple nights(although nothing really happened).  We were greeted when she walked in the door with a kiss on the lips(to both my wife and I).  Nothing hugely alarming, but for the past 10 years, it's always been either a hug or a peck on the cheek.  So during her visit, she's dropping hints about Sister Wives and Big Love left and right.  At first, I didn't really catch on.  My innate reaction was ""I can barely handle dealing with one woman in this house, let alone two.  I would never be correct about anything if I had to deal with multiple wives.""  She laughed and took it how it was meant.  That night, the friend decides that she wants to watch tv in bed with my wife and I before lights out(not a problem, we have a California King, and we do that quite frequently with most of our friends).  So she makes sure she's in the middle and at this point, it's obvious where she's wanting to go.  Nothing happened, her 10mo old woke up, so she got up and went to bed.  Next night, my bf's wife wants to go out on a 'date' with me.  Once again, no big deal.  It really just meant she wanted to go enjoy some good brews and chat for a while.  So we did, came back after a couple hours closer actually then we were before.  We're really similar in a lot of ways, and we never really had a chance to just sit and talk, just the two of us.  So we get back home, and same thing, we head for bed, although this time, her kid woke up before we made it to the room.  But the same vibe was there.  Now, the next night, my wife takes her and her kid to her sister's house, where the three ladies were going to go out and get their hair done and such.  During the ride there, she bring up to my wife that she's interested in expanding our relationship.  Whether it's the three of us, or the four of us.  Also talking about when they move back to Oregon, how they want us to at least be on the same property as them, if not living in a shared household.  Now, I know my buddy has no qualms with this what so ever.  He's given me permission to 'not do anything that I wouldn't do'.  Which in actuality, isn't really that big of a surprise.  The four of us really are like one big family.  We're able to share and do pretty much anything with either partner(non-sexually), and it just doesn't matter.  There's absolutely no jealousy or envy, we just truly enjoy being around each other and consider ourselves our own family.  


Where I'm running into problems:

So I'm completely split 50/50 on this matter.  Part of me thinks this is fantastic and wonderful.  The other part of me doesn't think I could handle someone else being inside my wife.  I mean, these two friends, well, they're more than just friends.  They really are family.  They're also our kids godparents, and the types of people that you just want to have around.  Now my wife and I have had many conversations about this as well, and I just don't know.  I've been completely open about my issue in the matter, although my buddy doesn't have the same issue and gave me permission to f his wife while she was down here.  My wife doesn't have an issue with it, and neither does my buddies wife.  It's already been determined that everyone has to be fully on board for it to happen, so I'm not worried about peer pressure or anything like that.  But I do have some questions for those that have been in this situation before:

 - If you had concerns prior, how did it work out?  Did you go through with it?  If so, how did you feel after that first time?
 - What about social stigmas?  We have 2 boys that are 6 &amp; 3, they have one boy that's 10mo and are going to have another in 2 years.  I know that socially speaking, this sort of this would be very taboo, especially if we ended up sharing a household together.  
 
 
I appreciate any insight into this sort of thing ya'll at Reddit might have...

I'm a 19 year old male and live with my parents in northern Virginia. I'm writing this to you as an act of 

desperation after a particularly stressful and upsetting night. Please allow me to give some brief and relevant 

background information as I explain my motivation to write this. As stated, I'm 19 and live with my parents, who 

are of a particularly conservative and old fashioned breed. There has never really been open dialog regarding sex 

in my household. I got a few, very brief talks on sex when I was a kid. Then growing up, once my parents were 

aware that I was sexually active, a ""wrap it up"" talk was about all that ensued. That and ""don't do it in my 

house"", which I always found particularly funny and illogical. So its essentially been kept under the rug. I've been 

perfectly okay with that considering discussing these things with your own parents is not exactly comfortable, 

especially since its almost treated as a taboo subject in my house. Fast forward to tonight. My car has been in 

the shop, so my dad picked me up from work. When I got in the car, he told to me that I left my laptop open on 

my bed, with BDSM porn on the screen. Of course I nearly shit my pants. He told me that my mother was 

completely distraught, and so was he. To explain my relationship with this sort of activity, there isn't much of 

one. I watch perfectly legal, BDSM porn online. Not sketchy black market footage of actual rape, porn found on 

pretty mainstream websites (however hardcore). My mother had a very difficult time distinguishing the two. She 

seems to think that the girls in those videos are the same ones she saw being interviewed on some Dateline 

special about sex slavery. Also, me and my 18 year old girlfriend sometimes explore this sort of sexual behavior. 

Nothing to the extreme. Tying each other up, role playing, thats about it. Nothing to call home about. The 

discussion (or raging argument) that followed was of the utmost ridiculous kind. The short and sweet of the 

argument put me in a position where my parents legitimately think that: I'm a sex addict, simply by the fact that 

I watch BDSM porn on an irregular basis, I'm contributing to sex slavery, I'm a scumbag, downright literal scum, 

and that my mental health is in serious jeopardy. The whole scene literally appeared to be out of a PSA from the 

1940s. So I'm in a serious pickle. My question to you is what should I do? How should I approach this? 

Considering I can almost guarantee that convincing my parents that BDSM is nothing short of extreme insanity 

and ""wrong-ness"" (as my parents have a very, very black and white view of things like this) seems impossible. 

There seems to be almost no room for open discussion. So am I left with the fact that my parents are going to 

view me like trash? I'm sure that I'm equally as frustrated and heartbroken as they are. Should I really have to 

keep quiet my fondness for rough sex? I'm sure I'm not alone in this, but when my parents are yelling at me and 

my mothers face looks as if I've just murdered someone I sure do feel alone. Any sort of advice, information, 

would be truly helpful. Oookay.

The story of why I receive monthly cash assistance and food stamps goes like this...

When I was around 13 or so,  I fell and injured my back. Chubby, out of shape kids, hard surfaces, and gravity don't do the body good. My dad got me chiropractic treatment for a few years which didn't seem to do anything to truly alleviate the pain. Sitting and standing too long was very hard for me. I'd be one of those kids constantly twisting in their chair cracking their backs and such. My dad never sought other medical advice other than chiro and who knows what else was really going internally. Whether chiro does a bit of good I know is a hotly debated topic and I won't get into that here. Let's just leave it with we at least made an attempt at treatment for the back problems stemming from the fall but whether or not it was the right decision, who knows.

About 15 years ago or so, I suffered another fall, this time falling out of my friends jeep and landing flat on my back, aggravating the back problems probably ten fold. 

Ten years ago, I quit my job because I could no longer even tolerate simply standing up, walking around, or siting down for too long through the day, and some changes were going on mentally due to increasingly horrible sleep issues stemming from the pain by ways of having to wake up something like every 45 minutes to crack my back and change positions. I was never in REM sleep long enough that my brain needs (still happening to this very day). I was and still am a very tired, miserable person who ends up wading through a thick brain fog most days and who simply feels a lot like an idiot.  You know your brain isn't going full bore, you feel like you can't handle shit that day and all you can do is lay in bed and stare at the computer screen; reading, clicking buttons and engaging in as little mentally strenuous activity as possible. You hide from phone calls, picking a napkin up off the floor seems like the most difficult task in the world, showering is out of the question. Every day isnt this bad, but you get the gist.
 
The only way out from the pain other than the small amount of time I manage to sleep, was just to lay down and take as much tension off my back as possible. I was working a sales job, and even though I wasn't standing or sitting too long for any one given period of time, it was still killing me with large amounts of back pain. This is when my social life really started to crash because going out anywhere required sitting and standing and it was just awful. No more concerts, no more long car drives, I severely cut back on everything. I definitely fell into a bad depression and luckily I still lived at home and my parents were tolerant of my life and I was living off them and really just being poor and scraping by and feeling like a piece of shit for multiple obvious reasons you can imagine someone in this case would have reason to feel like one

At that time, honestly if I did not have a family to let me stay with them, I probably would have ended up killing myself, because there was no way I could suffer 40 hour work weeks dealing with that kind of pain, and I still can't... in fact no where close to 40. It took me a while to fight through the depression to even begin to find the motivation to go online and apply for welfare and disability to at least get some kind of meager cash coming my way to scrape by and take some burden off my family.. 

Now to fast forward and try not to bore people away from this. 

I have been seeing specialists for years for my back problems to try and find relief, and I have zero. MRI's, therapy, injections... My actual diagnoses taken directly from my medical reports are as follows:

1: degenerative changes in L4-L5 and L5-S1. There is a broad right sided disc herniation at l5-s1 which causes effacement of the anterior epidural fat and posterior displacement of the right s1 nerve root. A broad based disc bulge is noted at l4-5 with annular tear which cuases a minimal impression on the adjacent thecal sac. 

2: there is a narrowing of the lateral recesses at L4-5 as well as the right lateral recess at L5-S1

3: Neural foraminal narrowing is noted at l4-5 and l5-s1 as described above

4: There is slight levoscoliosis of the lumbar spine. 

With those diagnoses, it boils down to these conditions:

Lumbar Facet Syndrome

Lumbar herniated nucleus Pulposus

Lumbar radiculopathy (Sciatica)

Lumbar Degenrative Disc Disease (spondylosis)

Thoracic paraspinal dystonia

I don't know how it is in other states, but I guess here in Pennsylvania, to be considered physically disabled, you may as well need to have all four limbs removed. The reasons for court hearings to determine disability are to figure out if you are disabled **from being able to work a job that actually provides you enough money to live**. Because I cannot sit or stand too long without wanting to blow my brains out, and due to the fatigue and depression issues stemming from sleep issues which in turn stem from the well documented medical issues I have, you would think that it makes sense that someone in my shoes really can't live a normal life. I still have all of my limbs, i can still walk, I can still run, I can still see... but can i sit or stand or even walk around 8 hours a day without being in extreme pain? No. 

Yet according to the judge's decisions, this does not mean I am disabled, and I should be able to work a job for enough hours to provide me a living wage. 

About 8 months ago, I helped a friend out on a job he had which required some light construction. I basically stood around and helped hold up pieces of wood, handed people tools, tosses stuff into dumpsters, cleaned up,  ran to the convenient store when needed... This lasted one full week at least 8 hours a day. I did this because I was and am tired of living like this and wanted to see how my body reacts to this sort of thing nowadays. I can tell you the experience was not at all enjoyable. Even after standing up there for an hour, my entire back, hamstrings, and feet felt like they had been beaten. My friend was  my boss, and he knew what I was going through so he let me sit down for 15 minutes every half hour or so, something I know for a fact would never be tolerated on any ""real"" job. Even relaxing through was not enough to quell the pain. I was so stiff and sore from practically just doing what any normal person would describe as nothing out of the ordinary. This surprised me because it's not like I am completely non active. I try and get to the gym regularly, I go for short jogs, I try and stretch. I try and keep myself in shape so I don't feel even worse. Yet I can't handle long hours of standing and sitting. After my friend would drop me off at night, I would get out of his truck hunched over like an old man completely unable to stand up straight, in severe back, leg and feet pain, and I would limp into my house, taking something like 5 minutes to be able to fully stand upright. 

So meanwhile I have yet another claim in for disability and I have been relying on food stamps and $200 cash assistance from the state. This cash is now effectively gone with the new budget that Governor Corbett passed. With $200 monthly I could at least scrape by, now I have nothing besides food stamps (for now, until Republicans take those away too). I'm going to be forced now to try and pick up some type of part time job from some place that is tolerant of my disabilities to make up for that money and deal with something like 15 more hours of pain in my life every week. The thing is, when I do that, I will most likely have my food stamps cut down to practically nothing, which means I have to really put myself through some rigors now just to be worse off than I was beforehand. See, if I work 15 hours a week, I'll end up with something like $85-$90 bucks after taxes working minimum wage, so something like $360 monthly which is just slightly under what I had to my name every month with food stamps and cash assistance combined. So really it boils down to me not even being able to subject myself to pain and bust my ass within my limits to get *ahead*, I have to bust my ass to now get further *behind* where I was last month. Hooray!

I really have no hope anymore that anything is ever going to get fixed in this body of mine, and feel like if it could be, that the doctors would have found out the answer by now. I am increasingly thinking that suicide is eventually going to be the way out at some point due to how thin of a thread that my life right now as I know it - where I actually have a roof over my head and can barely afford to eat - hangs upon. This thread can't hold forever, and I don't see my condition in either a bodily or environmental sense improving before that thread breaks. Having this meager chump change taken away from me now just puts more tension on that thread.  

I really have no clue what to do now. I'm writing this and putting it up publicly because I really would like to hear people's advice. I also want people to know that there are indeed people out there like me that are truly in dire straits and need help to get by. This $200 chump change was a life saver for many people. I want people to know while there may be people abusing the welfare system, the people legitimately deserving of it don't deserve to be spit on by their government because it lacks the ability to identify the abusers of the system. I also wrote this for people to get perspective,. I'd love for this story  - and hopefully many more like them from others - to  reach the lawmakers in Pennsylvania that signed off on making life hell for many people like me. I want them to really see the effects of the choices they make. I want to make it as hard for them to sleep at night by questioning themselves and their choices as it is for me at night dealing with the pain I live with, that is, if they even have a shred of empathy to get to that point to begin with. Of that, I'm not too hopeful. ",,False,,t5_2qhlj,1342231224.0,,,True,t3_wj083,http://www.reddit.com/r/ask/comments/wj083/i_am_one_of_the_needy_people_in_pennsylvania_with/,

I thought I could see if Reddit could help.,14,2,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/ask/comments/t97qk/my_grandfather_has_embarked_upon_a_quest_to/,"My Grandfather was stationed in Liederbach, Germany between 1951-1952. While he was there, he became very good friends with a family of four. Now that he is older he is doing everything he can to try to get in touch with them again. I guess it is some sort of final hurrah and the fact that he didn't stay in touch with them seems to be one of his few regrets. He actually went in search of them while in Germany last summer but his trip was cut short and he was unsuccessful.

This is what we know:  
* The family lived in Liederbach, Germany while he was stationed there sometime between spring of 1951 and fall of 1952.  
* He prounces the family name as ""Deedrick"" or ""Deetrick"" from what I've been able to gather this could actually be spelled Diedrich, Dederich, Dietrich or something along this lines. He doesn't know any first names as he claims it is customary to call someone by a generic title such as Mr.   
* The family consisted of a father and mother as well as a son who was about 12 and a daughter who was roughly 16.   
* He was informed that they may have moved to Alsfeld, Germany. Possibly sometime during the 1970's.   

I know it isn't much to go on. But we're hoping to get a phone number or even an address so that he can attempt to get in touch to arrange a visit. Thanks for all the help in advance.

Here's the story as short as I can put it. I had a bike crash, landed on my face and tore some skin off my face and shattered a tooth. The skin damage is a few patches, a few square inches each, some deeper than others. This happened 5 days ago. It was all healing pretty well, no infection and a healthy scab over the damaged areas. 
Until today. 
I went to the dentist, the tooth was cracked to the root and had to come out, apparently I have very long teeth.... After much pushing and pulling the tooth came out with more blood than I though necessary. After the treatment, I stand up, walk to the door of the surgery and wake up a few minutes later back in the chair. I had collapsed and fallen on my face. The scab was completely ripped off one of the patches.

TL:DR Skin wound opened after only 5 days of healing, what can I do to minimize the chance of scaring.

Now here is my problem: I don't want a permanent scar on my face, because I have lost the scab I have probably screwed up the healing process and I suspect it will greatly increase the chances of getting a scar.

And here is my question I was hoping someone could help me with: Is there anything I could do to improve the situation? Cover it? Creams? Sudocream? 

(I tried to find a more appropriate reddit, if anyone knows one could you point the way?)

Advice?",18,5,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/ask/comments/12j9hp/hi_reddit_my_wife_is_a_mans_woman_were_in_our/,"Reddit, I am a very lucky man. My wife is absolutely gorgeous, loves the full gamut of games from Halo, to Mass Effect, to WoW and GW2, to Mario Party. She enjoys playing board games, paper and pencil RPGs, and going to Ren Fest. Safe to say, I snapped her up quick. She's starting to run into a problem though.


She genuinely enjoys all those activities, she did not get into them just to seem like the ""cool girl."" Whenever we find a new couple to hang out with, or one of our guy friends gets a lady, we're finding that it's kind of expected by society for her to hang out with the lady despite usually not having anything in common. She's rather play video games with me and our guy friend than talk to the girl about...well whatever it is they generally want to talk to her about. They share very few interests. We don't really know what to do about it. My wife's not a jerk, so she doesn't just leave the girl to be bored and watch, but you see the dilemma.


We're also finding that it's hard for her to make guy friends. It seems to be a trend that one of two things happen; the guy wants to be friends until he realizes she only wants to be friends and it will never be anything more, or the guy gets a girlfriend who says they can't hang out anymore.


**TLDR; My wife wants to be friends with people who share her interests, those people generally aren't girls, and it's hard to befriend guys without them wanting something more or their girlfriends getting jealous. Any ideas?**


**EDITED TO INCLUDE IMPORTANT CLARIFICATION**
A very valid question from itsrachellolz:
&gt;""Man's girl?"" Uh. It's pretentious to assume she's so dudely/unlike girls because she likes certain things. That's a turnoff for lots of girls: is to meet some rando chick and not be able to relate to her because the girl she meets is so above her as if she ""wouldn't understand her interests because she likes boy things."" I dunno if she exudes this air, so hopefully she doesn't because that could be an issue.

She definitely doesn't. This is something she struggles with internally and talks to me about. She hangs out with other girls frequently, but they simply don't tend to share the core group of interests she does. They'll have a few things in common, just not a lot. She genuinely cares about what they have to say, and tries her best to invest in any topic they might bring up. ""Man's woman"" is a term I'm using because it's an easy descriptor, and she would certainly NEVER say anything like that especially not around another girl.

* hookup to projector and living room speakers
* shared netflix account
* steam for video games

1343623605.0,9,self.ask,xdkf2,How does one cope with suicide?,10,1,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/ask/comments/xdkf2/how_does_one_cope_with_suicide/,"On Friday, my brother-in-law hung himself, leaving his young wife to raise their two beautiful young girls alone (ages 4 and 2).

I should mention that I'm using a throwaway account and leaving out names since I've not asked my sister-in-law if posting details of this tragedy would be OK.

My wife and I have always been very close to her sister (the new widow, my sister in law, who I've known since she was 11). We're floored with grief. We're angry, we're deeply sad, and concerned about how my wife's sister can move on.

The anger is hard to admit, but it's there. I'm a father with two kids. I know how hard it can be to make the mortgage payment, pay off debts, and work hard to keep food on the table. I've hit some lows in my life, but I'd never abandon my family. Never.

But thinking like that leads me to asking myself how much mental pain and suffering must he have been in if hanging himself was the ""best"" option in his mind. Would I be strong enough to climb out of that hole? I know in my heart that it's unfair to make any judgements here, but then I swing back to being angry.

Hurting or not, rational or not, his actions have had significant consequences. He left no safety net, no apology, no explanation. His wife and kids deserved, at the very least, something.

I cycle through these feelings of deep anger and empathy practically from
minute to minute.

Then I put myself in my sister-in-laws shoes. How would I feel if my partner did the same thing? The horror is unthinkable. How could I not blame myself in some way? How could I not hate them for their selfishness? How would I tell my kids what happened? How would I prevent them from thinking they had something to do with it? How would I be able to keep myself together enough to keep them fed, let alone lift an arm off the floor?

How does the partner of someone who commits suicide move on?

Practically speaking, what should she (or my wife and I) do with financial/legal matters? We're already looking at what to do with the home. The loan balance is more than the home would sell for, so that makes it hard. My sister in law makes a small amount of income - the majority came from my brother-in-law. There was no life insurance (though I doubt it'd cover suicide anyway). There are friends and family who can help with places to live and  babysitting but not much financially. Should she apply to welfare? Are there assistance programs? Grants? Should we ask for donations? What can we do to help ease the non-emotional burden she's found herself in so she can at least have some breathing room?

If people think it's relevant, I can ask for permission to share more specific details by way of updates here.",,False,,t5_2qhlj,False,,,True,t3_xdkf2,http://www.reddit.com/r/ask/comments/xdkf2/how_does_one_cope_with_suicide/,

I'm 22 and have had 2 serious relationships. We were monogamous in each of them. I've always believed in monogamy. But over the past few months I've been dating a lot and questioning why monogamy is so important. Before I became single I didn't really give it much thought. Being monogamous was just a social norm. We are all naturally attracted to more than one person and have compatibility with more than one person. Do you think it's possible to have a healthy open honest relationship? Is monogamy fed by our own insecurities and selfishness? 

I read an interesting note of one of my FB friends'. She quoted that monogamy is a biological affair. Primates (whom we evolved from) had larger hip bones which enable them to give birth at later developmental stages which meant less parental care was needed. They were polygamist. Since humans have smaller hip bones we give birth at earlier developmental stages and this helps induce the act of monogamy due to the extensive parental care needed to ensure our children survive. 

Please share!

What do you do?

I've been going to school in a **large** college town for four years now, and I've seen my fair share of fights in my time here. Every time a fistfight or scuffle begins near me I always have to stop and make a decision about which is the best course of action (call for help, break it up, call the cops, etc.) My first instinct is always to jump in and break up the fight (I'm a guy and I'm in pretty decent shape with more experience in defending myself than the average 23 year old, but nothing special) because it's the fastest way to stop the fighting, and therefore reduce the likelihood of someone getting seriously injured.

Tonight, I drove a friend home from a fraternity house. At one point in the drive I was waiting in line at a stop sign and I noticed two college-aged guys on the sidewalk shoving one another. The shoving became more intense and the two ended up in the middle of the intersection, then they started throwing punches and it became clear relatively quickly that one of the two men was winning. At this point my first instinct, as mentioned above was to get out of the car and pull the winner off of the loser before any serious injury could be done, but I considered the possibility that the winner might be in a rage, as well as a better fighter than me, and start swinging at anyone who touched him in that situation. I asked my friend what I should do and she simply replied, ""get out and watch?"" I ended up calling the police, but I always feel like calling the cops makes me look bad or something. 

TL;DR: Saw a fistfight begin in front of me tonight, and didn't know what to do.

finding tenant, have their Drivers License #, SSN.",11,1,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/ask/comments/gxvyv/first_time_landlord_got_screwed_over_need_help/,"This is my 1st submission to Reddit, so I hope I'm doing it right.

So long story short, I got married recently and had to rent my home so that I could live with my wife.    Tenant paid me about 2k in rent over 2 months, stopped paying, had to be evicted, and ruined my home.  The tenant did about $10,000 in damages that I have to repair before another person would even want to move in.  Not to mention the 3 months rent I didn't get while she squatted in my home waiting to be evicted.

I used a management company, and got totally screwed over by them.  I was stupid and trusting (the company's rep is the mother-in-law to my wife's best friend).  Lawyer said I unfortunately have no case against them (moral: get EVERYTHING in writing).  My lawyer said my only real option is to sue tenant and hope she's employed so I can garnish wages.

So it seems like my next step is to find my tenant.  I have no idea where to go, all of these people finding websites seem like scams.  I have her name, twitter, facebook, and e-mail address.  I know I have her correct drivers license number (she stole stuff from me, turns out she gave me a wrong license number, but the cops told me the real one).  I have what I believe to be her SSN.

How can I find her?  More usefully, how can I find where she works (if she is working).

This whole ordeal has been rather... eye opening... to say the least.  And as you can imagine has pretty much a worse case scenario, and the stress and financial strain come with pretty bad timing.


**tl;dr** I got screwed for $10k in damages + 3 months rent.  Only option is to sue tenant, need help finding them with the info I have.  Timing of all this couldn't be worse.

**edit1:** I should point out that she probably is still in my state (Georgia).  She has been in the same county (Gwinnett, where my house is) for at least 8 years.  I am not the first person she's done this to.  She's been evicted 6 times in 8 years in the same county that I live in.  Yes, Property management should have caught this in their ""background check"" but they didn't, and I don't have in writing that they would do one (only verbal).

&gt;Update below*

&gt;Someone took my phone. A Samsung Galaxy S3. It's white. It's only worth a few hundred bucks to you or anyone else. If you unlock the screen you will see my home screen. In the picture stands a man. A man with a backpack and 2 other bags. That man you see, was my husband. And that night, it was the last time he ever held me. If you open the gallery you will see a collection of photos. Mostly of him. But some of his children as well. You will also see some of his funeral. Of his burial flag, his coffin. See, that man you saw on the home screen. The one who looks so eager to head into a war zone to protect the country he loved and his family, he lost his life doing so. The only pictures I have of him are on that phone because my computer crashed after I transferred them. Tonight, I cried uncontrollably in the arms of a friend because tonight I felt as though I lost my husband once more. I know with time my memory will fade. I will have difficulty explaining his features to his children. Or why I think they look like him. One who never had the honor of meeting his father. I don't care about the phone. If you have it.

&gt;UPDATE: 5-16-2013

&gt;I wanted to post an update to this ad because unfortunately I do not have time to respond to each heartfelt email I have recently received. Most emails are asking about my old computer. Unfortunately after a trip to Best Buy and being told the data I was after was not retrievable I saw no harm in throwing away the computer. I had previously backed up the photos on my phone. They were not backed up after the computer crashed. I apologize for that misunderstanding. For those asking the general area where the phone was lost we were at a get together near Warrenton Road and Cambridge (Route 1) more in the Stafford side. I sincerely appreciate all of those reaching out and trying to help. Please keep in mind I am raising 2 kiddos alone and with end of the year things and field trips etc and one becoming very busy as a new toddler I am unable to thank each one of you. Please know you walk with us in our hearts in a very special place. 

&gt;For the person who emailed me saying they believe they know who has the phone please email me back. 
For those concerned about the money it is from my husband's life insurance policy and I am not walking around with a large sum of money. When you've lost someone so dear to your heart you begin to realize what matters and what does not. For this reason I am keeping a certain level of anonymity to maintain the surest level of my family's safety as I possibly can. 

&gt;After posting this I took time to reflect and came to peace with things. I was in complete hysterics when I wrote this and apologize for anything that may have been misunderstood or misconstrued I do have older photos from my In laws they have been gracious enough to copy for myself and grandchildren. Along with photos from professional photo sessions and emailed to relatives. In that moment that night it felt like everything had been ripped away. 

&gt;Thank you so much for the servicemen and women who have reached out to donate to the reward and offer their services. The only thing I ask for you is to stay safe and to come home. I can not take anymore than the selfless love you are already showing this wonderful country. For the gentlemen who served with my husband thank you so much for your kind words. I was very touched so thank you. 

&gt;For others asking to donate I wholeheartedly appreciate all of the offers but I simply can't take anything from anyone. Prayers and thoughts are free and if you are willing to continue giving us those we are grateful for that.*",,False,,t5_2qhlj,False,,,True,t3_1egn2c,http://www.reddit.com/r/ask/comments/1egn2c/this_has_me_in_tears_is_there_anyway_to_contact/,

I need advice, I need someone to listen to the relatively common, but nonetheless devastating event happening to my family. I'm trying to protect our identities, so I've changed names.

I'll start off with the **TLDR**, and then proceed with the lengthy story. My boyfriend's son's mother is in jail this weekend for 2nd degree rape of a minor.

**Name key:**

* Micah = my boyfriend, 29

* Max = my boyfriend's son, 8

* Terry = my boyfriend's exgirlfriend of 4 years, Max's birth mom, 29

* Caroline = Terry's bestfriend, mother of 4 children

* Connor = Terry's oldest son, 15 years old


**Some background information:**
Micah and Terry are split up and have been for years. Micah and I have been together for around 2 years and living together the whole time. Micah and Terry have joint custody and Micah has physical custody, meaning Max's permanent address is ours. Max lives with us, and visits Terry Tuesday afternoons and every weekend beginning with her picking him up from school on Friday and Micah &amp; I picking Max up on Sunday. We live in the southeast.

So.
Friday afternoon, Micah and I pull into our apartment complex after just having gone grocery shopping. He takes a call from a number he doesn't recognize and it's Terry. She's crying and saying she's in jail and can we please pick up Max from the police station in the town she lives in. Micah asks her why she's in jail and she said something about her bestfriend's 15 year old son, and then ends the conversation. Needless to say, Micah and I are shocked. What happened?! We knew that Terry's bestfriend, Caroline, and her children had been living with Terry off and on for the past few weeks while Caroline is between houses/husbands. (Caroline and Terry are very close, by the way. They are like sisters, aunts to each other's children). 

So, Micah and I put away the groceries and start speculating. I get a sick feeling it involves some sexual abuse of some kind. There's nothing to indicate Terry is capable of such a thing, it was just a gut feeling. (I may have taken into account the fact I know she was sexually abused as a child and could be potentially recreating her experience.) Micah has different ideas, and of course is trying to think of any other possibility. Caroline's son, Connor, is what you'd call a n'erdowell. So in our minds it's entirely possible that he stole something, and since he's living with Terry she got caught up in possession of stolen property? Maybe they found drugs on him and he's saying he got them from Terry, or maybe he's got drugs in her apartment? We don't know. Micah and I drove out to her town's police station to pick Max up, all the while trying not to think the worst. 
We arrive, and Max is nearly in tears and very very quiet (not at all like himself, he's ADHD and is constantly on the move/talking nonstop). He's visibly shaken. A DHR lady takes Micah aside and tells him that Terry was picked up for allegations of rape/sexual abuse of a 15 year old. So, we leave and we get Max in a talking mood and keep him distracted and don't worry about telling him what's going on because we don't even know yet. We get home and keep him on what would be a normal routine for the most part and put him to bed. Micah gets a call from Caroline, and she lays it all out for us.

The night before, Caroline says she walked in on her son, Connor, on top of Terry. Caroline says she went and knocked Connor off Terry and snatched up his phone. Caroline finds all these dirty text messages between Terry and Connor. Terry and Connor have been trading explicit pictures, and beyond that, they are ""in love"". Caroline said she sat outside for hours crying. This was her BEST friend, they went on vacation together, picked up each other's children from school, they were living together at the moment! How could Terry do this? She's twice Connor's age, what is she thinking?! Has she been sexually abusing Caroline's other 3 children (all under 11)? Has she been sexually abusing her OWN son? I'm not close with Caroline, but I can't imagine how she felt that night. All those questions spinning in her head, she probably felt guilty (with no good reason, but nonetheless *feeling* guilty) for allowing this to happen to her son, and possibly other children. 
Caroline says the next morning (Friday) she and Connor go the police station to turn Terry in, fill out paperwork, etc and they get a search warrant for Terry's phone. Of course, they find all the correspondance between them. While Terry and my stepson (he's my stepson to me, even if it's not legally true) arrive at her apartment after picking him up from school, the police arrest (no handcuffs though) Terry and take her and Max to the police station.

Caroline told us that Connor told the police everything. They are in love, they have sex regularly, Terry buys him cigarettes and whiskey. Caroline says she starts realizing some of the odd behavior she's noticed out of the 2 of them for the past few months. She says her other children told her Terry and Connor often ""punish"" the other children by locking them in one of the bedrooms all together at the same time for time-out while her and Connor go into her bedroom. She says they frequently went into Terry's bedroom to ""talk"" and always locked the door. Caroline says one time she tried to get into the bathroom and she hears Terry &amp; Connor giggling inside, and they've locked the door. Terry had been paying to keep Connor's phone on (so they could continue their relationship) even when Caroline had cut it off because of his disrespectful attitude and poor behavior in school. 
Caroline told us she's been charged (forgive me if that isn't the right word, I'm not good with legal terms) with 2nd degree rape of a minor and if convicted will have to register as a sex offender among other ramifications. Micah and I start looking into things, and it seems possible they could tack on extra charges of child neglect and (for the other children she ignored to have sex with Connor), possession of child pornography, contributing to the deliquincy of a minor and some other things possibly.

So here is were we're at. This all happened yesterday. Terry's bond hearing is Monday and we don't know if she's going to be able to get the money together (we're afraid she will) to get out. What happens next? We have to find a therapist for Max to find out if he was a victim, too. Micah and I are terrified to let him go with her the next coming weekend. Micah can deny her visitation on Tuesday because it's an extra day they agreed on that's not in the custody papers, but what about the weekend? Until we know ANYTHING more, we don't want him over there ever again. Can she file charges or bring Micah to court if he denies her visitation based on what happened? I thought, once upon a time, I read somewhere that a parent can file for emergency custody and avoid the legal consequences of denying visitation so long as there was a sound reason. Like you think the child will come into harm if you let them go with the other parent.

Will be Micah be able to go for full custody now, or is it too early to tell? We think we may have to find out how's she charged and what the parameters of her probation will be, if she has one, jail time if there's any, etc.
Our main concern is Max. He's very close to his mother and losing her will be so tough. We want to be able to explain to him in a way he'll understand what is happening, but not this weekend. Soon though. We want to get him checked out, of course, as well. We are so worried how this is going to affect him. :(

I'm just at a complete loss. Can anyone answer any of those questions? Does anyone have any advice? A similar situation? Sorry if it's written like a chimp, I've just woken up from a restless night with all of this on my mind.

Thank you for listening, thank you thank you thank you.

I assisted in organizing the counter-protest to WBC last year when they came to Meade High School and it became a really phenomenal event.  We baked cookies and made posters and everyone sang Queen in unison and we had almost 400 attendees.  

This year I'd like to actually do something productive (and not share a video about an African child-army leader a zillion times).

I'd like to set up a table and take donations for Glen Burnie High school as well as other LGBT charities/organizations. Then after the ""counter-protest"" make the donation in the name of the Westboro Baptist Church. 

The reason I need reddit is because I'd like your input on which charities/organizations are the best to donate to (yes I am asking for your help in researching) not because I'm lazy but because I trust you guys and other than a Facebook event there is not much more I can do to raise awareness. 

I will try to speak to the same guy that interviewed me from the newspaper last year and start there but other than that I need help in spreading the word so I can better organize this and actually fund some organizations that the WBC targets.  Of course, I encourage you all to donate to whichever charity means the most to you but I honestly think that if the WBC is faced with this every time they come to my are to protest and we only support the cause they are trying to fight, they might stop showing up in certain areas. 

At the very least something good would come out of the situation.

",9,0,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/ask/comments/mmcrd/do_i_just_have_bad_sleeping_habits_or_is/,"I am sure most of us here on Reddit are quite familiar with lack of sleep, but I am starting to worry that it just may be a little more serious than that. Also, please do not tell me to just do a Google search because I am not looking for an ""internet diagnosis."" I am looking for people with some insight who may have gone through the same thing and who could recommend some solutions. 

So let me try to give some information. 

* I am an 18 year old, female college student 
*  Over the past few years, the hours of sleep I have been getting has been decreasing. Now I average anywhere between 2 and 4. Occasional all-nighters here and there.
* I used to take a cycle of naps instead of one continuous block of sleep at night, but now I have been skipping naps all together. 
* I do not consume large amounts of caffeine. However, I do workout around 10 o'clock nearly every night.
* When I do eventually get to bed and lay down I am usually restless for quite some time and have difficulty falling asleep.
* There have not been any traumatic events in my life recently- nothing to cause great amounts of stress other than typical college student stuff. 
* I don't really know if I have felt well rested in quite some time. 
* This is what is most disconcerting to me: I am physically and mentally tired, but I just have no *desire* to go to sleep. This is hard for me to explain, but I feel like if someone else experiences this then they will understand. Usually I try to do something until I fall asleep, i.e. read a book, put on some soft music, etc. 


So my fellow sleep-deprived Redditors, does anyone else experience this? Should I be concerned enough to seek help for it? What can I do on my own to improve my quality and quantity of sleep? I do not know what the degree of severity this is, but I do know that it cannot be healthy. Any help/advice/personal testimonies are welcome and appreciated!

(So much so that it's become a [TV Trope](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastOfHisKind). [Warning!  Warning!  Danger, Will Robinson!  Only follow that link if you have an extra 2-3 days you can devote to following rabbit trails.])

My question is, what scenario best explains how this could happen?  Impact with a comet or meteor might do it, but there would be enough of a warning that a good many people would be able to seek shelter and survive.  A nuclear war might catch a number of people off-guard, but that most likely wouldn't kill everyone, and the threat of global nuclear war is less than it was, say, in the 80's.  Maybe a massive, strategically-placed terrorist attack (to take out our defenses) followed by a massive bombardment of conventional and nuclear weapons or something?  (But that most likely wouldn't involve the whole world.)

Granted, the likelihood any of these scenarios actually happening is infinitesimally small anyway, but what i'm looking for is -- if i wanted to write a story where a massive chunk of humanity was wiped out, what would be the most likely scenario to accomplish it?

Thanks in advance!

[EDIT:]
I'll just put all of my comments here:

Yes, I realize that even 99.9999% would leave thousands of survivors, but that would be pockets of humanity scattered across the globe (some in Europe and Asia, some in the Americas, some in Africa and Australia).

Super volcano is an idea i hadn't considered.  That might be workable.  About the best thing I could come up with was a comet or asteroid that was supposed to come near the earth but miss it and either the scientists got their calculations wrong or something altered its trajectory and there wasn't time to react.

-I ended up following the ambulance and seeing my dad taken out on the stretcher.
-I was in the room when my mother decided to have them stop CPR.
-I feel like partially responsible, irrational as it may be. 
-I have checked on my mother daily, since I live in town. (my siblings live 2 hours away)

I just lost my license for 6 months and this has put me over the top.  I have sketched out a tentative plan. Load all my shit into a uhaul and go back to my parents when the lease is done at the end of June.  A small town away from the chaotic day to day bullshit of the city.  I'll also setup an office in the basement of my grandparents and have a place to crash at either.  I have plenty of friends I can move in with if needed.

I'll spend July camping, mountain biking, backpacking.  I have two free plane tickets and plan to take my dad to Glacier national park for a couple weeks of backpacking.

Mid August I plan to fly to Europe for a month, buy a rail pass and explore as much as I can.  I should be back by mid September.  At that point I can start looking for jobs closer to ""home"".  By the time I start getting calls and having things setup, it will be Mid October and I'll have my license back. With all my new free time, I plan to spend part of it working on some Android apps and do some coding that I'd like to do if I had the time. 

Without getting into the details(I have a spreadsheet) I estimate that I'll have $25,000 remaining by the time I get back from Europe.  I gave myself another $5000 getting back on my feet leaving me with $20,000, worst case scenario is $15,000.

A lot of people tell me I shouldn't do it and I should be thankful I have a job.  It's actually gotten to me and I'm nervous about following through.  I hate the area I live in and it makes me depressed.  When I leave here, I dread coming back. I want to be around my family and true friends.

  My chest looks about that strange, except that one side is about an inch and a half lower than the other side. 
 

  I've always been extremely self-conscious about my chest. I refuse to wear t-shirts in public unless forced (like for a job uniform--trying to work while constantly wondering if people can see my chest is pretty taxing every day.) I have worn hoodies and jackets over long-sleeved shirts outside on ninety degree days. 
 

  According to doctors, nothing about my condition is life-threatening or physically dangerous--it just looks hella strange and my obsessing over it has given me a lot of social anxiety problems over the years.
 

  I've looked into the surgery, but it would (of course) be extremely painful, not to mention *expensive*, and I don't think I can afford to leave my job for as long as it would take for me to recover. What I'm wondering is, is there anything else I can do to minimize the noticeability of my chest? Are there any prostheses for men with this condition? A lot of the less-invasive help out there seems to be more for women, who can sometimes mask the condition with breast implants or bra inserts.

I've been looking to join a credit union around my area for awhile, and I've recently found one that I'm somewhat interested in that offers what I'm looking for. However, I noticed something that sort of disturbed me a little.

They have a certain high interest checking account that they've offered for awhile that you're eligible to join for if you meet a few requirements, such as 12 debit card transactions monthly. Apparently the rate for this account is dropping from 2.5% to 1.5%, and the amount of transactions required has more than doubled to 26 transactions. To top it off, the interest rate 2 years ago seems to have been even higher than it is now.

So I guess my question is, is this an indicator of bad things to come? Those sorts of changes sound pretty sleazy to me personally, and I'm not sure if it's a response to the economy or what.

Sorry if this is a -really- stupid question, but I'm kind of just getting started here and looking for good advice while trying to find a reliable credit union. Thanks.

And for one more discussion point, **do you think there is anything about the demographics of reddit that cause our community to be more or less-favorable to these so-called hipsters?** I'd say that a shitload of the links that are upvoted are things that appeal to hipsters, but a hell of a lot of the comments seem to hate on all things hipster.

The wifi was provided by a 3rd-party company, located here:  http://www.hotelwifi.com/.

The first odd thing I noticed was that, instead of directly accessing the internet, I was being routed through the above company's ""portal"", which essentially provided an inescapable ""browsing toolbar"" at the top of each page, full of local ads, helpful ""deals"", and so forth.

To be clear, this was a toolbar of the gray-market variety that one sometimes downloads accidentally...except that it was *not* an actual part of any browser toolbar...but rather a ""sub-window"" at the top of every webpage one visits.  

I could halfway tolerate this concept if the wifi had been free...but I was paying $19/day for it.

Most disturbingly, though, was the fact that the company evidently sold my email address to spammers.

Like most redditors, I'm reasonably savvy with IT/tech.  The only reason I provided an accurate email address at all was so I could get a receipt, as it was a business trip.

I'm usually very, very careful about giving out my personal email address.  So the amount of spam in my inbox is usually quite low...less than 1% per day, at a guess.

Within 12 hours of signing up for the above wifi service, though, the spam I receive went up *exponentially*.  It is probably close to 25-33% of my daily inbox volume.

I provided my email address to absolutely no person or organization within the prior 7 days, as I'd been on vacation and away from my computer. 

I realize this wouldn't stand up as proof in a court of law...but to my mind, there is a direct one-to-one correspondence between my use of the above wifi service...and the deluge of spam.

Just curious if anyone else has had similar experiences....?

They've been fighting all summer about various things. The start of all this was me forgetting to wash my hands before touching the fridge. My Dad decides to yell. So I just go over to the sink and he keeps going ect. This is semi-normal behaviour I replied with ""Don't give me the lecture"" and he goes upstairs and threatens to break something I own. This is the norm for his rants. As always, my Mum calms and talks him down. ""This is the last time"" is also a popular saying. 

From there he's taken it as an opening to pretty much claim that my Mum has turned all 3 of us kids (23, 21, 19) against him. I'm the youngest of the three. We're not against him, but he gets angry and thinks he'll be right about everything or claim stupid things. It's been a problem for a while now. This summer has been the worst though. 

They cancelled and re-booked their holiday and now they've both said as soon as I go back to uni they're about to have a long talk about everything. In all honesty I think this more means my Dad yelling at my Mum for stuff she has or hasn't done. They're multiple stories which I won't go into unless reddit requires moar. 

I guess I'm just looking for what I should be doing now, or what I should do before/after it happens. Maybe stuff you wish you had done in this situation? I hope it doesn't happen of course and everything melts away but I don't see it happening this time.

You see, I've always known my mum has struggled with money, I mean, she's a single parent who raised 3 children working a low end public sector job, so of course she'll be cash strapped right?

But I've recently discovered that things are so much worse than I thought.

She has been the most selfless parent I could imagine, putting us before her 100% of the time, trying to give us a better quality of life than the one she had growing up. But I always thought that she managed to skirt on by. Unfortunately, I've found out that she's been racking up debts to support us having as close to an 'average' life as possible (I guess technically we're in  'relative poverty'). Even things like school trips would put huge dents in her budgets... And I feel so guilty because for the first term of university my loan didn't come through and she had to support me (which hurt her finances especially because she no longer recieves child support for me). Today I found out she's even been using multiple 'quick loan' websites, the ones that cover you until your next payday but charge huge amounts of interest, to cover her monthly defecit.

To top it all off, because she works in the public sector she has been affected by the public sector pay freeze, which (due to inflation) is essentially a pay cut. 

It's absolutely heartbreaking, and she's too proud to admit any of this. I'm at my wits end, I have no idea of how to help her... I have university, where I'm living of government grants (which only just covers things) And my older brother (who now earns more than her) is too much of a cunt to send her money and she would never ask him for any. I contributed the last of my money to her, but it was only about £20 :(

We have a 10 month old.

We have been in marriage counseling on and off for 6 months and nothing has changed.  I've changed, I've done the things she's asked and or demanded of me, she's done nothing to change.

We constantly fight and argue about nonsense shit.  

We'll have 2-3 good days all to be ruined by a goddamn fight about nothing.  

Being 37 and from a family who isn't divorced and her being 35 with both of her parents married more than once (her mom 4, her dad is on his 9th) - she sees divorce as the logical answer or conclusion to everything and I literally cannot comprehend this kind of thinking.

It's so foreign to me and I cannot figure out wtf to do anymore.  

It's like banging my head against a concrete wall over and over again and I'm tired, exhausted and broken.

Admittedly, at this point, I'm only still in this marriage because of my son.  I believe he deserves to grow up in a happy home with two parents who love each other - but I guess I need to come to grips with the fact that my home isn't happy and there are two parents who seemingly don't love each other.

So, what's worse, continuing to fight and continuing to work on the relationship -- or just say fuck it -- get a divorce and hope I don't fuck up my kid?  Can I still have those moments at baseball games and take him fishing and do all of the things my dad did with me -- except live in different home?  I realize that a divorce isn't the end of our problems as a couple or parents, I'll still have a relationship with his mom by default.  

I'm so confused, sad, worried, angry, exhausted and don't really know what to do.

Mom, my brother and I were driving a long and lonely stretch of road, similar to the road Forrest Gump had stop running on. Seriously i live in Utah it's pretty much like that where i was visiting. It wasn't really a lonely road just straight and long and I was halfway between the two cities it connected. Essentially thirty miles of nothing in either direction. 

It was half past midnight, the last town i was in I had just filled up on fuel for both me and the car. The IPod on shuffle, I reached down for more people fuel, Sweet Tarts. When i looked up a pair of headlight had just crested over a small hill. I immediately dimmed my high beams. Thinking nothing much of it, I kept going. Munching on my roll of sweet tarts, drinking my soda listening to music.

Next thing i know, the cherry lights of the police is right behind me. Pulling over on one of those, ""emergency turn outs."" they have available. I know i wasn't speeding, the speed limit posted for this road is 65 mph, i had the cruise set at 60 because jack rabbits and other nocturnal animals *coughskunkscough* are out and about and i absolutely hate hitting them. I was on the road between my lines no swerving. Seriously it's point and shoot with how straight the road is. 

Mom and Bro were napping, i was chillin to my music and candy. I had no idea why I was being pulled over. Turning on my overhead lights, i grab my wallet and insurance. The police comes up to the passenger side. (weird?) He then asks me if i knew why he pulled me over, I'm like 'uh no...'. He then tells me, It's for two things, one my tail light is broken, yes i know this there's a small piece missing, about the size of a half dollar, but the red plastic cover is still there AND the light is still operational I'm waiting for insurance to pay . AND because i didn't dim my lights fast enough for him!!

*nods*

Yep... that's what he said, ""Uh, ok."" Then he did the licence thing, he didn't even ask for insurance or registration. Then he told me he was letting me off with a warning... FOR WHAT? Not dimming lights super fast for him?! 

So thus my question, is not dimming the car head lights enough to warrant being pulled over?

I have a friend who is in a relation ship with a man from Pakistan. They met 7 months ago on Facebook and have been Skyping back and forth ever since they met. She is hopelessly in love with him, and from what I have heard, so is he.

When his father found out about the relation ship he had to choose between my friend and his family. He chose my friend. When he did so, his family kicked him out. So he deiced to make his from Pakistan, across Iran and into Turkey to live (or to be able to come to the States). At one of the borders he was detained for 10 days because he apparently refused to give up a keychain. After being detained he was sent back to his family.

They are now engaged and she is trying desperately to meet with him for the first time, and get married.

We have tried explaining to her that married culture in Pakistan is completely different from that of western traditions. We have even arranged for her to meet with another friend who married into a Pakistani family so she can get an idea of what she is in for.

I also should mention that my friend is 26 years old, and does have some form of arrested development where she acts as if she is 14.

I have spoken with my family about this and some family friends and they have all suggested that I contact immigration services or even homeland security and find out what they have to say about this situation.

I know that she is an adult and that she needs to make her own decisions and mistakes, however this is bigger than maxing out a credit card or skipping classes.


**TL;DR** I have a friend who is not playing with a full deck who is engaged to a man in Pakistan after talking to him online for 7 months. She is trying to go there and meet with him for the first time. She will not listen to the concerns and red flags that her friends see.

As a result, I've spent quite a few days sitting around, unable to make plans because I've not been sure whether I'll be called in or not. 

This policy began because too many servers were calling in at the last minute without bothering to find a replacement.

We live together and have for 3 years. She comes from a large family of &gt;6 siblings, all ranging in age; her oldest brother is older than my mother with the kids ranging from 27 to 49 years old.

A long while back we were having a conversation about her family. Somehow we got into the topic of how old her parents were, with her mother having her at 40 years old. At some point we got into talking about her sister, and how she always buys her a nice Christmas present. I jokingly made the remark that she was secretly her mother and we laughed it off. Later it dawned on me that it could very well be true if she had gotten pregnant at 18. 

Skip ahead a year and I am talking with my mother, and I mention the sisters name. She comments on how much the two look alike and I make the same bad joke that she's secretly her mother. My mother turns white as a ghost and tells me I cannot speak of what she is about to tell me. My stomach drops because I know what she is about to say.

A coworker of my mothers lived in the same neighbourhood as her family for the last 40 years. She told my mother that the sister did in fact get pregnant at a young age and gave her up for adoption, in which the grand parents raised the child as their own.

My mother has no reason to make up such a story and swore me to secrecy. Now I sit here with a heavy burden.

Reddit, what do I do? Holding back such a secret is difficult but I know she would be devastated to learn the truth -- she does not have a great relationship with her 'sister' and for the most part thinks she's a fairly terrible person. On the other hand carrying such a secret is lying through omission to the one person I trust completely in this world.

Do I tell her? Do I not tell her? 

I've debated trying to find out the truth for certain before I do anything but such a task is difficult. Without giving too much information I can state I am in Canada. My first thought was to request a long form of the birth certificate for her, bullshitting a passport necessity. This does include birth mother as an identifier but I am unsure if it can be changed legally. 

My understanding of provincial law is that records are sealed and short of her requesting information specifically there is no method to prove such a claim. Even so sealed records may prove it impossible in this province.

So naturally I decided to engage in the shenanigans.  What I need from you is help on my next move. 

What is the best way for me to waste this persons time?
 
Below are the emails thus far:

**Scammer:** Hello! I'm Mr. Subhash Deshpande from Taiwan. Please can i have your attention?
Thanks
Mr. Subhash

**Me:** Sure, 
Just wondering where you got my email from tho lol

**Scammer:** Thank you very much for your respond. I am Mr. Subhash Deshpande an Indian nationality and an account officer with the International bank of Taipei (Now Bank SinoPac of Taipei) Taiwan. Let me give you a detailed description of what is in this transaction for us. In June 2003, My late client Muhammad Al-Hakim, an Iraqi Crude oil merchant made a numbered fixed deposit of One Billion Five hundred Million Taiwanese New Dollars ($1,500,000,000.00 TWD) for 18 calendar months, this is valued to Forty Four million Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars($44.5 Million USD) only in my branch. Upon maturity several notices were sent to him, even during the war (U.S and Iraqi war), Eight years ago (2004). Again after the war another notification was sent and still no response came from him. We later found out that Muhammad Al-Hakim and his family had been killed during the war in a bomb blast that hit his home at Mukaradeeb where his personal oil well was. 

http://www.iraqbodycount.org
http://www.iraqbodycount.net/ names.htm

After further investigation it was also discovered that Muhannad Al-Hakim did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank. So, the Forty Four million Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it. What bothers me most is that according to the laws of my country at the expiration of Six years Six months the funds will revert to the ownership of the Taiwan Government if nobody applies to claim the funds. 

Against this backdrop, we still have about two more months left for someone to come up and claim the funds as next of kin to this fund. My suggestion to you is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Muhannad Al-Hakim so that you will be able to receive his funds and for the money be pulled out from my bank and out from my country. 

WHAT IS TO BE DONE? 
I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we shall come out successful. I have contacted an attorney that will prepare the necessary documents that will back you up as the next of kin to Muhammad Al-Hakim , all that is required from you at this stage is for you to provide me with your details as below: 

Full Name: 
Contact Address: 
Occupation:
 
After you have been made the next of kin, the attorney will also file in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter of probate in your favour for the move of the funds to an account that will be provided by you. 

There is no risk involved at all in this matter as we are going to adopt a legalized method and the attorney will prepare all the necessary documents. Please endeavour to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning this issue. Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bank account we shall share in the ratio of 70% for me, 30% for you. Should you be interested please send me your full names and current residential address.

Finally after that I shall provide you with more details of this operation. Your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated.
 
Kind Regards,
Mr. Subhash

Most of these people are declaring that the only thing standing in the way of America's economy starting its pace again is more job creation. I don't understand their logic.

The way I see it, most of the jobs that left America did so for a reason. They either were cheaper to pay for in other countries or the companies simply went under. Fewer Americans are employed and fewer Americans are even trying to get employed (minimum wage isn't enough for many). Blaming China or other Asian countries for better market conditions is like an Sudanese businessman blaming America for having more economic stability.

Most of the new jobs that are created thanks to the federal government are cheap temporary positions in building new infrastructure. I don't think this is going to help our economy in the long run. Those workers aren't going to have their jobs forever unless we keep pumping out stimulus packages, taxpayers are going to be stuck paying for shiny black roads, and the country will be back in a deeper hole.

We are all aware of the burgeoning income disparity between the social classes but it feels like we aren't tackling the real problems. Plenty of jobs still exist in this country. The problem isn't a lack of work to go around but a lack of compensation. Flooding the market with  more jobs is going to help people make more money, especially when some people are already responsible for two or three jobs.

This is really frustrating for me.

I like it because I've had too many roommate problems, people running off with my money, causing trouble that I have to pay for, or being miraculously unable to pay the last few months of rent. It's also utilities included, which is nice. All in all, with the random fluctuations of utilities in the summer and winter, it ends up being about the same as my friends who rent with other roommates and handle their utilities.

The issues arose when my first landlord sold to another property owner. The new owner's letter basically said, ""nice to meet you, sorry you won't be getting your security deposit back."" I called to speak with them, and they told me that they didn't get the deposits from the previous landlord, so they wouldn't be able to return them to any of the tenants. I called the previous landlord and he verified, and forwarded paperwork proving, that the new landlord was paid a large sum intended to cover the deposits for all the tenants in all the rentals.
They continue to maintain that they didn't receive the deposits and ""probably won't"" be returning them to anyone, whether they leave the property flawless or not.

I've had others issues with them... for example, throwing away my property for no reason (they unchained and threw away my bike, for some reason, and some other property of mine, and told me forwardly when asked that they did so), as well as not fixing issues in the apartment.

The newest issue is that they've decided to raise the rent. It's mid month, and they just left notices for everyone that the rent will increase 10%. So, my question is, what should I do with this? Presumably my lease with the previous landlord means squat, and they never had us sign new ones, I believe under the vague suggestion that the previous lease was still in effect.

I share an office at work with a woman. This woman is nice. Too nice. Here’s the thing, I like her. Not in that way, but in a harmless way, she’s not offensive at all. But she’s one of the most boring people alive. She doesn’t joke about, doesn’t “turn off” from work (ie. tells you that she’s going home to do work, talks shop) she also tells you what she’s doing at all times just in case you were wondering. Which I never am. She tells horrifically boring stories, like how she couldn’t get parked in the supermarket car park because of a lorry so she turned round and went to a different shop. That one she literally just told me as I was typing this out.

There’s about eight of us who are working away from our homes, so therefore on nights we all tend to stick together, or arrange to get a meal or a drink. However this woman latches onto me. I join the gym, she joins the gym. I say I fancy a meal, she fancies a meal. I fancy not having a meal but just grab something at the supermarket or whatever for evening meal, she wants to do the same. I don’t mind, but god its like shooting Bambi’s mother again and again whenever you tell her that you just want to do something on your own tonight.

Every time he gets like this I always stand up for myself, this obviously turns things into a very nasty argument because of his temper but usually within an hour of any argument he comes into my room and will offer me a handshake and a ""sorry, I went a bit over the top there...but you've got to admit your part in this too"" speech.


When he kicked off at me last night after I got in from a night out there was the usual anger and threats of violence, this time he said ""I will fucking knock you out"", he came into my room a bit later and offered the handshake and I told him no, I said that I'm sick of his attitude and after all these years of anger and threats I'm done with it, I told him that i cannot identify with a man who uses fear and threats against his own family and an apology won't smooth things over anymore.


It ended with him saying ""so you've chosen to hate me then, fine"" and walking out. I shouted back saying its what he's chosen with attitude after all these years and I don't want to know him unless he can change.




Thankfully he's out today so I haven't had to see him but I don't know how to handle things when he gets back, I have nothing to say to him anymore and I'm a bit lost to be honest. I feel that when I move out thats us done, which will make things very awkward because he's still living with my mum (just as a note he has the exact same attitude when him and my mum argue minus the threats of violence, also my mum will always stand up for me whenever he starts)


In the past I've suggested anger management therapy to him but he thinks that any sort of therapy is for people with mental disorders (he once called me a psycho because me and my Mrs went to couples counseling) and simply won't even consider it.

Over lunch we begin to discuss gay marriage which he says he is against for moral reasons. I told him that he had no right forcing others to subscribe to his personal morals legally. I added that gay marriage should be seen as a civil rights issue instead of a moral one because of the separation of church and state. 

His response was that if gay marriage is passed as a civil rights issue he could be sued or even jailed for refusing to marry a gay couple for personal religious issues. He said that he did not care if gay couples married but he felt that if he voted for it he would lose his freedom of religion to disagree with the choice the couple was making. 

This is not some distant paranoia he is feeling either. There are accounts of pastors being sued, prosecuted and even jailed for professing the biblical belief that homosexuality is a sin and refusing to perform marriages for personal reasons.

And I'm not sure I should qualify that with ""lately.""  I guess it's a knack I've had for quite some time.  Hell, maybe always.

I always tell myself it doesn't bother me if I piss people off.  You can't please everybody.  But it is starting to bother me.

It occurs to me that one way to know you're an asshole is if you don't care whether you piss people off.  Hm.

Anyway, I guess it's getting to the point where pissing people off is such a persistent, frequent occurrence in my life that I can't avoid the question, ""Is it me?""

I usually feel I'm in the right and the pissed off person is in the wrong, but when you seem to be pissing off almost everybody around you, you have to start wondering if the problem is yours and not their's.

So let me tell you what happened tonight and you tell me if I was being an asshole.  Maybe I'm just missing something.  Or maybe I have the wrong attitude about people or something.

This isn't a dramatic story.  In fact, it's kind of silly and petty.  And maybe that's my problem.  Maybe I ask for trouble where I shouldn't.

I should say I'm a guy in his early 40s.  I'm fat and ugly and not usually very sociable.  I wasn't always this way.  I had my glory years, but I've definitely gone to seed.  I don't have a problem with that.  I keep to myself, I don't have a woman to please, and staying healthy is too much damn work.

Anyway, I go to my local grocery store and collect about 10 items and get in a short line at the ""express lane"" checkout.  There's a woman at the head of the line paying for her stuff and a young couple, probably in their 20s, behind her and ahead of me, but with no groceries.  The guy is holding a $20 bill.

As we stand there, two skinny, pretty, teenage girls appear at the back of the line and call to the couple in front of me.  The two girls are each waving a pint of ice cream above their heads and saying something about can they join the couple ahead of me and buy it all together or something.  The two girls move past me and place their two pints of ice cream in front of my stuff and start talking to the couple.

Now, already this irks me a little, but I don't say anything and I tell myself that they all appear to be together and they're going to buy the stuff together and so who cares.

But then the guy kind of brushes them off saying he's just going to get change for his $20 and he doesn't want to ""join"" in their purchase or whatever they were suggesting.

So the two girls and the young woman (who is the other half of the couple in front of me) hand some money back and forth so the two girls have the money they need to buy their ice cream.

Then the guy is talking to the cashier getting his change for the twenty, while the girls wait their turn to buy their ice cream.

Now, at this point, it's obvious that the ice cream purchase is going to be a separate transaction.  The kid is going to get his change and then the girls are going to buy their ice cream.  Which means there's no more ambiguity at this point, the girls just cut in front of me like I wasn't there (and one more woman who was behind me).

I say, ""excuse me,"" and I reach forward and take the two pints of ice cream and place them behind my stuff on the conveyor.  Then I put one of those little rubber sticks between my stuff and their ice cream.  Then I make a point of turning back and looking at them to see if they have anything to say about it.  Both little girls avoid my gaze and shuffle past me to get in line behind me (although still in front of the woman they also cut in front of, although she never said anything that I know of).

Everybody is real quiet at this point.  I don't feel awkward, but it seems like others do.

So, in my mind, the two girls are a little embarrassed and realize they shouldn't have done what they did, they've accepted that they don't belong in front of me, and now we can all get on with our lives.

They ring my stuff up quickly, I pay quickly and head out the door.

In the parking lot, while I'm loading my stuff into my trunk, I hear a loud voice saying, ""In a hurry to go eat?  Starving?  In a real hurry, are you?""

It's the woman, the one who was in front of me with her guy.  She's shouting these things to me as she leaves the store and they head toward their car.  I see the guy but don't notice the girls, although they must have been with them.

She says, ""You should get over yourself.""

I say, ""Okay, I'll try to get over myself.  Why don't you try to not be so rude.""

She says something else but I don't remember what it was.

I get in my car and start navigating through the parking lot only to find them pursing me.  All four of them in one car.  The woman is driving and flipping me off while motioning for me to roll down my window.  I see the two girls in the back seat laughing and flipping me off.  I smile and give them a thumbs up and turn away down a lane in the lot.

They follow me and cut me off at the other end of the parking lot.  They're shouting things but I can't hear, and they're flipping me off still.  This time I just smile tiredly.  The woman is ahead of me when we are exiting the lot to get on the street and she plays a little game trying to block me until oncoming traffic would prevent me from exiting, but it doesn't work and I ignore her.  Finally we go our separate ways.

Now, I know that was a long, silly story and I appreciate it that you're still with me.  Here's my question:  Was I being a dick?  Am I just clueless?

To me, I didn't do anything inappropriate, although I certainly could have let them cut in front of me and buy their ice cream and it really wouldn't have been a big deal.

But I asked myself why I should stand there and do nothing when I was being rudely dismissed by inconsiderate people.  That's how I felt, anyway.  I just felt I should stand up for myself.  Maybe there was a better way to do it.

I don't even think I would be asking myself this question if it didn't seem like things like this are always happening to me.

But maybe I just need to get over myself.  And maybe I don't see what is obvious to everyone else.  Maybe I'm getting agitated about things that others let slide.

But I don't feel like I'm the one who made it a big deal.  I just wasn't going to shrink in the face of rude behavior, but I made my statement and I was done.  I didn't expect it to continue into the parking lot and beyond.

I didn't say anything rude to anybody, or shout or threaten or use foul language.

And, honestly, if one of those pretty little girls had turned to me and said, ""Is it okay we cut in front of you?"" then everything would have been fine.  I would have said, ""No problem.""

But I still feel like an asshole.  Am I?

I'm 29, and live in my dad's basement. I have a BA in Psychology. I've got a great girlfriend, and a close circle of friends. I have a part time job and only work 24 hours in a week with twelve hour shifts on Saturday and Sunday. I make less than $300 a week. I save some, but I make enough for me to live comfortably for the moment. And that is very much the heart of my problem. I'm so comfortable that I don't really have very much drive to improve upon my situation. I'm content. 

I moved into my father's basement with the idea that I'd do volunteer work to improve my resume. My goal was to get a job teaching English overseas, preferably in Japan. That has been my stated goal for the last two years. The truth is that I don't want to teach kids. I don't really like kids, and I'm surprised that no one has called me on this bullshit yet. In my youth, I was very vocal in my hatred of the youth. 

I really just want to travel. Nothing makes me happier than the ground flying by beneath my feet. I would love a career that I could do from anywhere, but I have no idea what that is. 

I've also limited myself a bit with some bad life choices. My GPA was just good enough to graduate at a 2.0, and the DUI 4 years ago doesn't help either. Also, that's a DUI in Tennessee, which means it will never go away. Pilot was one of my dream jobs, but, as I understand it, I'll never get a pilot's license with a DUI on my record. 

My other dream jobs include; Doctor, Journalist, a Research Scientist, or all around computer guru. If I were a doctor, I'd join Doctors without Boarders as soon as I graduated and without hesitation. I'd just want to hop from village to village and provide medical services whereever needed. If I were to get into a grad program I could turn my useless BA in Psychology into a somewhat useful Masters or PHD. I love academia, and all my friends that are in grad school tell me how much I would enjoy it. Although, I've never been anything more than a straight C student. What I think are the more realistic options are to try to break into journalism, or gather a host of certifications to become an IT guy. I'm just not sure where to get started with either of those. 

I have an insane amount of time on my hands during the week, which usually gets devoted to juvenile distractions like watching movies and playing video games. Every so often I can get enough motivation to start myself on some good habits, but with no long term goals they usually get forgotten about in a few weeks. 

So Reddit, what do?

Edit- Also note, I'll be getting off work in an hour and a half, but I'll be back here 8 hours after that. Yeah, I forgot to mention I get to surf reddit all day at work. Pretty sweet, huh?

Edit2- It's probably also important to note that I have money. I've got a trust fund that will come to full fruition on my next birthday.

Should we get married ASAP?,7,1,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/ask/comments/1dwm9v/my_fiances_work_permit_expired_and_he_is_having/,"Hi everyone!  I am a long-time lurker of Reddit and this is my first post.  I really hope someone here can help us, because we are in a tough situation.

I will start with a little bit of a background story.  My fiance moved to Canada (Nova Scotia) in May 2012.  He is from the Philippines and moved to Canada for work.  He ended up working at the same place as I and also living in the same apartment building.  We fell in love around 2 months after he moved and we haven't been apart since.  In December, he proposed to me and I said yes.  He is my one and only true love.  

However, his work permit expired in the beginning of April 2013.  His employer has applied for his LMO two times since then and it has been rejected both times.  He is a skilled worker and it is not only him that is being rejected.  Other co-workers have been rejected their LMO and they have to go back to the Philippines after 3 months.

We have approximately 2 more months to get his work permit.  After that, he will have to go back to the Philippines.  We are starting to get really worried, because it is all over the news about how the government of Canada wants to only hire Canadians and they are forcing foreign workers to go back to their home countries by rejecting their LMOs.  I know his employer is doing everything in his power to better his chances of getting accepted, because he is a valued employee.

My fiance and I started talking about different solutions to the problem and marriage came up.  We know we are going to get married eventually, but we are wondering if we should get married ASAP.  If we get married, he can apply for his permanent residence and we don't have to worry about his LMO anymore, because he will be a citizen of Canada.  However, we are wondering if this is the best course of action to take?  Will it help his chances of staying in Canada or will he have to go back to the Philippines anyways?

So, we ask you dear people of Reddit to give us some advice.  I love him so much and I don't ever want to be apart from him.  My fiance feels the same way....we love each other so much.  We are both scared about what will happen and we need help.

TLDR; My fiance's work permit has been rejected two times and we fear that he will not get it.  Therefore, he would have to go back to the Philippines.  We are wondering if getting married ASAP would be the best course of action.

Do other countries have a stand already?

My friend and I are wondering if hardcore pornography, not real in the sense that no humans were used or harmed in the creation process, and the legal system was brought into play, what cases and consequences would arise. 

I've seen photography of very young children nude, in galleries, and they are clearly selling these images as art. But we're they in any form of sexually suggestive situation, trouble would arise. Even a picture next to the nude picture that makes a sexual suggestion, putting the interpretation wholly in the viewer, would probably raise some issues.

[xpost from r/law],8,1,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/ask/comments/1algkt/is_it_illegal_to_take_pictures_and_print_private/,"Full disclosure: I work in a hotel and left my Facebook up on accident at the end of my shift. While we aren't technically supposed to be on Facebook, it's something that is allowed to slide if all of our work is done and it is not interfering with guest relations.

The page I left up was just my feed. My coworker went into my inbox, and ran a search for her own name as well as the names of the rest of my coworkers. If she found ANYTHING negative, she printed it and/or took pictures of it with her cell phone. She has since passed them along to management, pages and pages of my private conversations. The general manager told the assistant general manager that he is going to ""make my life a living hell.""

The only case I've found similar to this one is Marcus v. Rogers, in which Rogers saw that Marcus's inbox had been left open, with his name clearly visible. This led him to print copies of the emails, which he then used in a later administrative hearing between the two of them. Marcus retaliated by suing him under New Jersey's version of the Stored Communications Act. The jury voted in favor of Rogers, since he didn't actually actively go searching for the emails -- they were just there, in full view.

Since this person willingly clicked away from the page that was left up and went poking around in my business, which wasn't readily visible or accessible without her making a choice to look into it, would that put her firmly in the wrong?

Any advice would be appreciated, though I know that lawyers aren't supposed to offer legal advice outside of the states where they are licensed. My assistant GM, mother, boyfriend, and friends think I should get a lawyer and sue for harassment, but I really don't want to cause a bunch of havoc if I don't even have a leg to stand on. I was hoping someone may have a bit more experience for something like this than I do. I'm just completely floored, and feel incredibly violated.

I know people who are working a lot at good paying jobs but take home a lot of stress and are left with little free time. And then there's me in the middle. Getting by being relatively happy, very little stress (aside from this), healthy, but I don't look forward to going to work. 
How important is doing what you love to you? Does that necessarily have to be what you do get paid to do? Do you view your job as a place to put your time in so you can afford to do things you love outside of work? And if you have any advice in seeking new careers or feel like you're in the middle like me, I'm interested to hear what you have to say. 
Final reminder, I'm not trying to vent my first world problems to the internet, just interested in how others feel about this and open to advice.

The other day, my mother let me know there was something really important that she needed to tell me - that the man whom I thought was my father for the past two decades or so of my life is, in fact, not my father.

All of this right after my mother and stepfather (whom for years has been my father figure, the guy I call dad) decide to call it quits on their marriage (for different reasons, they grew apart).

For 23 years, I've hated the other man whom I believed to be my biological father- he always seemed reluctant, would make empty promises and leave me waiting countless weekends of my childhood.

Now I find out he's not even the right guy.

My mother keeps calling this new guy my dad, and finds it necessary to only call him that or keep reminding me that he's my dad.  I've only found this out two days ago, and I don't want to call this guy dad.  I don't know the whole story about why I was lied to for 23 years, and to make it awkward, they (mother and ""dad"") are coming to eat dinner with me this weekend.

I'm one of those people who have a hard time speaking up about things that bother me, particularly this.  I automatically switched on this fake ...I don't even know what.  I just didn't want my mother to cry because it was obvious she felt guilty enough about lying to me for so long, but...I don't even know if I have any interest in meeting this guy right now.

I'm so hurt and confused.  When I look at myself in the mirror now, I question who I even am.  In the blink of an eye, everything I knew about my family history was completely flipped upside down.  Now the last name that's tacked onto me, I've been made aware isn't mine...but, it's been mine for 23 years.

I don't know how to handle this.  I guess I'm just looking for advice from anyone who has been in any situation similar to this.

How do I tell my mother how this makes me feel?

How do I even come to terms with how this makes me feel?  When I think about it, I want to vomit.  I get this terrible dark void in my head when I think about who I am.  How my mom could let some other man play the father role and never be there, and let me be angry at someone for so long, who now, I don't even know deserves it (Granted, he was shitty to his other kids, whom ....well, aren't actually my half-siblings anymore I guess)

**TL;DR - found out that the man I thought was my biological father for 23 years (and whom was constantly letting me down) isn't, and that the man that my mother just moved with (from her fresh separation from my stepfather) is my actual father.  How do I come to terms with how terribly awkward, terrible, and awkward this makes me feel, as well as the sudden want to be in my life?**",,False,,t5_2qhlj,False,,,True,t3_11d2p6,http://www.reddit.com/r/ask/comments/11d2p6/how_do_i_deal_with_this/,

Our houses are well built with thick walls, I can't get my wifi in the garden to give you an example.

It seems that on the topic of War On Drugs the vast majority of reddit agrees: It has failed and it has got to stop.

We all know the tragic side effects this war has had over the last 4 decades all over the globe. 
The statistics over how many people have been down right slaughtered or got their life ruined in some way as a direct effect of this failed war are all wellknown.

So I wonder, if one of the big organizations that work to end the war on drugs (not just marijuana like NORML are currently fighting for) were to do a kickstarter or something, would many of you donate?

I am in contact with one of the directors of one of them and have suggested this for him, but he is not very familiar with reddit and such so nothing has happened yet. 
Which is sad because these people have dedicated the rest of their lives to end this war on drugs and travel all over the world to try to convince politicians and others to end this injustice.

I think it would be good if he did a AMA and a Kickstarter on behalf of the organization he is a part of (one of the largest).

Recently I have had a course TA for one of my courses, who I think is the most amazing girl I have ever seen! She is an international graduate student from China!
The moment I saw her, I felt that I have to be with her, so contrary to my introvert image, I approached her and asked her name and booked a meeting with her for some course doubts. Although I ace the course, I still wanted to meet her so I made up random doubts and asked her. This happened for couple of times and I added her on facebook. After a few chats I got to know that she loves action movies (made me fall for her even more :D), so I asked her out for a movie for Valentine's day evening, she refused by saying that she has to go for a party at a friends house and this term she is writing her thesis so she is a bit busy, but she thanked me for asking her :S

I felt immense anxiety through my veins, and thought I would give up on her as clearly she is not interested! But I could not  focus on other things, so i tried to talk to her again, found out that she is looking for a job and since she doesn't have North American Work experience she is facing problems. Now because of my internships I had some contacts so I said I could help her out and she said sure, now I have got her an interview from a big company. We met a couple of times after that (mainly attending company info sessions) and chatted for a good 5-6 days everyday before going to bed, talking about each other.
She asked about my school project and was impressed and asked if she could join it for some experience, as expected I agreed :P
I have my exams these days so I can't really get to meet her, but I plan to meet her to prepare for her interview and explain my project in more details to her.
I have tried a lot in hinting her that I REALLY REALLY LIKE HER, but I am not sure how much did she understand! I even did not sleep for 30+ hours so that I could do my midterm studying and help her out for getting an interview (ofcourse she doesn't know :P), hence I know I am very much in love with her :D I even started learning mandarin and watching mandarin shows!
Now there is this other guy who I think is after her and since he is a grad chinese guy (grew up locally), I feel he might have a better chance !
I am not sure when and how should I tell her that I really LOVE HER! PLEASE REDDIT PLEASE HELP :S

-Triscuits, Candy, etc.

In short form the idea is we give people discounted event tickets if they wear a supplied t-shirt, this shirt will have a companies logo who give us money for the advertising. We take some of the money from sponsors and some goes towards the discount.

Interest for an event would be collected through a website, and then discounted tickets will be available for purchase. We would then distribute the tickets and shirts. (Ideally we would want the shirt to *become* the ticket somehow).
The sponsors get groups of people wearing their logo, the public get cheaper tickets to events and we get a cut from the sponsor. Win,Win,Win!

I'm tired of managing my music as files, but so far I haven't found any decent media player to help me with it at all. iTunes is bloated and slow. Winamp has lately been just as slow, and the media library seems almost useless.

I love Amarok for Linux, but haven't been able to find a version for windows that runs with full capabilities.

I love VLC, but it doesn't manage shit, it just plays it.

The features I'm looking for:

* Store a database of songs, with a fast search.
* Easily create playlists, but don't lock me into using playlists (sometimes I just want a single song)
* Rename files based on ID3 tags, and also re-create ID3 tags based on file name.
* No fluff (I don't want visualizers, equalizers, album covers, ""more info"" or anything like that. I just want to see my music, and play it.)
* The ability to play online streams is nice, but not required (I love Pandora, especially for ambient music)
* Plays WMA, MP3, and OGG
* Low footprint (visually and resource-wise. My computer isn't too fast, and I still need to run all my work tools.)
* Plugins are nice. I like to be able to speed up audiobooks by about 80%, or sometimes changing pitch for kareoke night is fun.",,False,,t5_2qhlj,True,,,True,t3_a6476,http://www.reddit.com/r/ask/comments/a6476/ask_reddit_what_is_the_best_music_managerplayer/,

My husband has been approached about possibly taking a position overseas. The money is fantastic, I'm on board and think it would be a wonderful opportunity.

My ex-husband may pose a bit of a problem, though. While he has never been what I would call a good father, I am foreseeing some issues if this comes to fruition.

As it stands he sees my children (8) for a brief stint during the summer, spring break, and sometimes at Thanksgiving.

His involvement with them is abysmal at best, and he is not a good influence on them at all. He brings random women around constantly and even when he has them he spends most of his time playing pool and drinking with his friends. I feel very grateful that we live far enough away that visitation is sporadic.

My husband (their stepfather), on the other hand, is WONDERFUL with them and has truly accepted them and treats them just like they are his own. I couldn't ask for a better father figure for my children.

Now, the question.  If my husband takes this position overseas, what is the best way to approach my ex and ask his permission to take them with me? My husband and I have batted around the idea of telling him that we will not require him to pay child support for the duration of our stay and offering to pay for the children's plane tickets when they go to visit (we currently split it...for the most part - my husband and I end up footing the bill about 45% of the time.)

I have a feeling that this offering of money will make him more open to this idea, but I would love some insight on how to even approach it with him. He is not an easy person to deal with.



TLDR; Want to take kids overseas if my husband takes a new job; how do I get the ex to agree to it?? 

EDIT:  This was originally posted to get advice on how to get my ex-husband to agree to let me take my children overseas if an opportunity for a job pans out. I was never asking advice on whether or not this was the best decision for my children. I am the only one that can make that decision, and will do so bearing all of the facts in mind. As far as what is legal or not regarding my making him an offer to suspend child support for the time that I am gone - I have very specific reasons for even considering that and while I am in no way, shape, or form a lawyer....in my head (and I admit that I may be wrong) if we agree to it between ourselves and he gives me written permission to take the children - there is no reason whatsoever to have lawyers become involved. There is no garnishment of his wages in place - he simply transfers the money from his bank account to mine on the 1st and 15th of the month.  He has skipped payments before (with my permission) and we certainly didn't need a lawyer to modify the support agreement those times.

Seems like this is a hot button issue for some of you, and some of you seem to think that I am completely clueless and making life changing decisions regarding my children with no consideration of the effects on their lives. That could not be further from the truth.

IF this job opportunity comes to fruition and IF we feel that this is the all around best decision that can be made...only then will this be pursued.

At this stage here is what has happened - my husband has been approached by his current employer with the possibility of a position overseas. He and I have discussed it and agreed that we are open to it. He has told his employer that we are open to the opportunity and to keep him posted on the details.

Today I came home to the basement filled with a quarter to half inch of water and feces floating around my washing machine. My son is staying at my parents tonight for this reason. I informed the landlord when I discovered this and he's left a message with a plumbing company. As for the maintenance this is the last straw.

When I moved in there was a longtime tenant who worked a lot so that was fine. She ran out on her lease telling me ""good luck"". Now the neighbors upstairs moved in about four moths ago, we have quietly been going insane. They scream at their very young children the way I wouldn't talk to adults. We don't swear (much) in our house and yet they are up at 4am swearing at their babies for how early it is. I don't like being yelled at 6am on a Saturday to ""take a $%#&amp;&amp;$# bath!"" The yelling is unnerving me and my son who is autistic hardly wants to be here anymore.

Do we have some kind of grounds to break the lease? I will give 30 days written notice &amp; the landlord can keep the security deposit = 1 months rent for his trouble.

Was with an incredibly abusive boyfriend for three years. He cheated on me with my best friend, and she is now his girlfriend. I finally left him. Hadn't spoken to him in about eight months when I suddenly get an email from him. Attached is a video of me giving him a bj that I DIDN'T KNOW HE TOOK.

Flipped her shit. Got another email today from him saying that he's posted the video online somewhere. Won't say where, so I kinda doubt he actually did, but the threat is still huge.

My plan:

He doesn't know that I know his Amazon password. I have filled his cart with anal torture toys, bondage and leather kits, and dolphin fetish items (his girlfriend's swim team is called the Dolphins).

My ex-girlfriend and I were together for a year and a half during college, but I graduated and got hired for my dream job outside the country. Until I leave, I've moved back to my home town to spend the time I have left in the States with my family, and also do some temporary work with another company that will shine on my resume. We agreed to end the relationship on a high note rather than see it spiral slowly downward over the distance and crash when I moved overseas.

Our relationship was nearly perfect. It was filled with love, trust and affection, and we never had a single fight. I helped her overcome some major inhibitions, like self-confidence issues and a reluctance to use English (her second language) in social situations. Most importantly, I helped her get over her physical inhibitions stemming from sexual abuse she suffered as a child. It was a long, slow and emotional process, but we were patient and understanding with each other. It brought us closer together, and by the end of the relationship were both deeply in love with one another. (This account is a throwaway because my friends know my main one, and if they recognize it this would out her as an abuse victim. That's not my call to make.)

It's been five weeks since we broke up, amiably, and I moved away. Two weeks after the breakup, a guy she goes to school with asked her out. Two weeks after that, they had their first date. One week later, she contacts me over Facebook chat and explains that not only did she go out with the guy, but she proudly announces that she slept with him on the second date and asked for advice on whether to start a relationship with him.

During the past five weeks, I've been rather isolated. I work odd hours and barely know anybody in this small town anymore, and my family's schedules are so hectic that we don't even have time to sit down to meals together. I'm trying my best to get over both the ex-girlfriend and all the friends I left behind at college. But I still miss them terribly, and her most of all. So needless to say, it felt like a punch in the gut when she told me (in great detail) about her feelings for him.

I understand her reasons for going to me about this — I know her better than anyone else and she feels comfortable talking to me about these things. She isn't malicious enough to want to rub this in my face. And I'm not trying to shame her for sleeping with the guy so quickly; it's her life and I don't have a claim to her anymore. I was a good friend and calmly told her that I wasn't the best person to ask for that particular situation. But after finding out I've been replaced so easily and her sending me a picture of us right afterward to joke about her posture, I was hurting more than I had in a long, long time.

So, Reddit, let's commiserate. Tell me a story about a time when someone has done something for you, or asked for your help, in good faith but wound up making things worse for you.

Ever since I was a kid I've found myself waking up in strange places or occasionally even having such vivid dreams that resulted in night terrors, ending in me waking myself up with my own screaming. But for the most part, I haven't minded it; always an interesting thing to talk about and usually results in funny situations, but not recently. This past weekend my girlfriend was sleeping over my house and it was just the two of us. I fell asleep much earlier than her and at one point she walked into my room and I have a vivid memory of only seeing a shadowy figure and feeling in danger for me and my girlfriend. At that point, from what she told me, I jumped up screaming something, grabbed her throat and threw her to the ground. I woke up when she turned the lights on and had no idea what I had done. Accepting the reality that I could harm someone I cared for so deeply tore me apart inside. That night she could barley look at me and we could only sit there crying, me being so confused and afraid of myself. Since then, we've both moved on passed it and have accepted that I had no control over myself. My problem is, is that I am still afraid of this figure my mind created in my head. I still think it is there lurking in the corners of my eye's and in the dark. I obviously know it isn't real, but I can barley sleep some nights without thinking about it, especially if I wake up in the middle of the night. So please, I could really use some advice here. What can I do to get over this paranoia/fear? Do you think I should get some sort of professional help?

What kind of damage can I do taking this much on a daily basis.  I have just received my second cortisone shot for a L4L5 herniated disk with nerve root compression. It has not been a full week since the second shot so I am aware that I am not getting the full benefit yet. If this shot does not work the next option is operating.  They will go in and try to scoop out the material that is pushing on the nerves.

I guess I'm looking for risk/reward in saying no to surgery and just living on ibuprofen as long as I can.  I have found studies that found GI and Kidney problems with dosages 3200mg and higher. Also has anyone ever had the 'scooping surgery'?  The surgeon said it is fairly non invasive.  Still, I don't like the thought of being cut open.  

I have been on this dosage since May, and it really has not caused me any problems so far.  I can take a 800mg pill on an empty stomach with no issue. I am hoping that this second shot will make it so I can cut out painkillers completely but I am concerned about what happens next.

And when I say a lot, I mean a fuckload.  I love sodas and energy drinks.  I drink a Monster pretty much everyday.  Well yesterday, without trying to or realizing it, I went probably sixteen or so hours without any.  And I was just a zombie.  I didn't know why, and it seriously sucked.  All I wanted to do was sit on the couch.  So I finally figured out what was up, I hadn't had any caffeine.  I wasn't about to go anywhere.  I'm not even sure I would have gotten up for the apocalypse.  So my awesome friend went to the store and bought me a Monster.  After I drank it, it was like I was a new man.  I was back to my normal self, ready to do stuff.  Now, I had always joked with people that I was addicted to caffeine.  But holy shit, this means I have a physical dependence to caffeine.  I find this to be really alarming.  I would just cut out sodas and energy drinks, but without that I literally can't function and accomplish all of the things I need to do during the day, like go to class and whatnot.

* What certain Universities look for.

* Things I can do that will help me in my application process.

* If any of the Universities offer scholarships (i.e. of the sport and academic variety)

* Corrections on anything that I say. (e.g. No MIT don't look x kind of people)

* Basically any general advice would be greatly appreciated.

* Potential Leaders

* Consistency (i.e. Good grades and reports)

* Things that make one stand out from the crowd

* Diversity (i.e. not just an academic, but a sportsperson or someone who helps out in the community

    * What can I do?: Volunteer at the local Observatory or research facilities

**Stanford**

    * Tests that need doing:The ACT Plus Writing or the SAT (Critical Reading, Math and Writing) is required of all undergraduate applicants. Also recommended to do individual SAT subject tests

* Oxford

* Berkelely
 
* Any of the Ivy League's

* Cambridge
 
* Caltech

    * As you can see I have not gone into as much detail with the second choice Universities as I do not have the time and it would have made the post too long and boring but any information relating to International students applying to them and/or information that is along the lines of the knowledge shown of the First Choice Universities will be greatly appreciated.

My campus is fairly religious (Christian), though not officially associated with any religion (every Sunday's nondenominational chapel is PACKED and everyone, staff included, speaks as if they assume you believe in God).

There is an all-male organization on campus that goes by the acronym GOD (pronounced ""jee-oh-dee"" as to avoid sacrilege, I suppose). This tells you everything I was able to gather from the presentation they gave when trying to get new recruits from my dorm: that it's a group of arrogant bros who spend most of their reveling in how much power they have and how awesome they think they are, with some community service here and there (I know I'm biased because I'm not actually *in* the club, and as you will see, not all of my peers see them that way). They also boast about having great connections; those who graduated from the club will be happy to help those in the club get a leg-up in the real world.

My roommate Chris and I decided not to apply, but our other roommate, Rob, did, and got in. He spent a week being hazed (outlawed on our campus) by being made to drink a bunch of alcohol throughout the week. Now, obviously this is problematic for many reasons, not list of which is that there are people with VERY LOW ALCOHOL TOLERANCE who may not even be aware of this low tolerance because they make a habit of abiding by the national drinking age law. Luckily, this was not the case this year (although apparently it was in a previous year, when the club was suspended for the rest of that year). Anyway, throughout the week, Rob did not feel or look so well, and many of his friends worried for him, but after the week finished, he was just as fine as he was before. After finding out, I made no plans to tell anyone (one of those things that's common knowledge among students but escapes the staff), although it upset me, because the danger had passed, I assumed they were going to get caught again eventually, and I didn't want to have to deal with the complications of being the one to tell (judge me on whether or not this is a good call, it's fine.) This is not the part I am here to talk to you about.

Two friends of Chris's, Ryan and James, applied and got into GOD, but were kicked out soon enough for being gay (James is not gay, though I confess I assumed he was as well). 

THIS outrages me to the point that it is not something that I cannot stand idly by and accept. This is discrimination at its purest, and I will not have this kind of thing go on at any university I attend without having anything to say about, regardless of any complications that arise from being a ""snitch."" However, I acknowledge that just because I don't care what happens to me, that James and Ryan should feel the same way. I also imagine that, should I tell someone and GOD does get punished for it, it wouldn't be that hard to deduce that James and Ryan were related to their problems (there can't have been that many gay students they kicked out just this year).

What to do?,8,5,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/ask/comments/lwmj9/found_some_kittens_in_a_bush_outside_my_apartment/,"I live in a large apartment complex. I went to check my mail a few minutes ago, and I passed a large and rather prickly bush and distinctly heard distressed mewing. I looked around for several minutes, but the bush is so thick, that I can't look into it very far. I thought I was losing my mind, because the direction of the sound kept changing. I finally heard some crying coming from one of the outdoor corridors between apartments, and I found a very small and fluffy black kitten huddled in the corner. I got near it, and it ran back to the bush.

Does anyone have any advice on how to handle this? I have no idea how many are in the bush or where mom is. My significant other is also very allergic to cats...

My first reflex was to inform the leasing office, but I'm worried that they'd just take the path of least resistance, even if it involved a kill shelter.

Oh, the one I saw was quite mobile, but it couldn't have been more than a few weeks old. It was maybe 8"" long not including tail and quite fluffy and adorable.

Edit: Caught one. Used gloves, thankfully. It tried to bite the hell outta me before I got it by the scruff. Pretty cute little rascal... put it on my screened in porch with a box to hide in and some water in a small container. Would tuna be bad for him/her?

Here's a [pic](http://i.imgur.com/oN7AK.jpg). Poor little guy wont use the box I provided, won't leave that corner... looks so scared.

He/she has calmed down a bit. Let me pet him/her a bit and actually purred a little. Seems to forget quickly though, because it's right back to skiddish a moment later. He/she ate some tuna. Seemed to enjoy it. Probably should prepare for it to come out either end at some point...

  I don't know how I should really go about doing this, nor would i ever choose to(fear of mockery, or just people being general dicks sometimes).  But, I truly have nowhere else to turn.  I've come across over my time on reddit, people asking for help and this collective of open-minded people giving them great advice that might actually make a difference.  So, I guess, here it goes.  I am a 22 year olds, currently working as a light technician.  I'm trying to get back into school so that i may finish my associates in arts.(had to take an extended break to move in with my grandmother after she had surgery on two different vertebrae in her back.)  During which, my loans lapsed putting me four thousand dollars in debt.  That aside, i started a payment plan with the collection agency, agreeing to pay each payment for the agreed months(6 i think?), which inturn will take the default off my credit score and allow me to go back to school.  I also pay about four to five hundred dollars in bills (rent, water, electric, etc.) Usually, with my line of work I manage these bills without any trouble.  However, last month we had to make temporary cutbacks to the company due to a slow in the market.(I.e. The shows we had booked for these 2 months either cancelled, downsized, or never put down a payment.)  Meaning, that i haven't been able to work.  When I was first told about what was happening i started my job search.  Making sure my resume was up to date, changing whatever needed to be fixed.  For the first few weeks, i was hopeful.  Waking up everyday, checking the local listings.  Sending my resume out, as well as scouring the business's for applications.  I had some money saved up, so I figured as long as I could find a job within the next few weeks, everything would be ok.  Then, one day I find that my car had been towed.  Once i finally located my car, i found i had a 2 unpaid parking tickets from months earlier that had acquired a large amount of fines to them.  So, before I could get my car out of towing(which is 25 dollars a day, on top of the tow which is usually 150, and after 5 days they can file for your title.) i had to pay the parking tickets, no big deal thats what saving's for.  Pay the 200 some odd dollars, and get 25 clearance fee from the city and head off to the tow truck company.  Between the time i could make it to the place to pay my tickets(lack of vehicle) about 5 days had gone by.  I get to the towing company, that now informs me my towing bill is 600 dollars. (150 for the tow, 125 for the storage fees, 325 for filing for my title)  With nothing left that i could do, i paid the fee with the remainder of the money i had saved to pay rent for the following months.  Losing my car would make it impossible to bounce back from any of this.  I live too far to walk or bike to work, and my job requires me to drive not only around my state on a day to day basis, but also to drive out of state.  Now, with no money, my seach begins to get desperate.  I still had food, so i could squeeze by with what i had. but the bigger task lay at hand. How to make my rent/debt arrangement.  I sent my resume to pretty much every listing, wether it be a maid, welder, doctor, prostitute(not really, but im pretty sure atleast one might of been a call service.).  Just anything to get a response, doing any sort of work, for any sort of wage.  Nothing, now i'm a day away from my debt payment.  if i don't make it, they cancel our arrangement, and take me to court.  I have a few more days, maybe five, six at the most to make rent.  I don't live near any family members, and my father and i haven't spoken to each other in 4 years.  My mother doesn't work, and can't help me anymore then she already has(driving me all over to get my car out of towing)  All i need to do is make it through this month, and ill be able to scratch by. I guess im asking for help.  Any kind, advice, ideas, or just a moral booster.  Because im pretty sure within the next week, ill not only be without a house, but without this community i've grown so fond of.   I guess if anything, im glad i can get this off my chest for a moment to something. 
Thanks in advance for your input.

1311643580.0,5,self.ask,izq33,Advice about a rental dispute (sort of) needed,6,1,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/ask/comments/izq33/advice_about_a_rental_dispute_sort_of_needed/,"Dear Reddit.  I need some advice.

I applied for an apartment in April and didn't hear anything back from them for 3 weeks, so I called them.  They said they didn't have any information on when the building would be open, other than middle of July.  Seemed alright with me...But then then the middle of July came, and things became worry-some.  

I should start by saying this is a complex of apartments, and the management company also manages 4 other sets of apartment complexes in my town.  These that I am moving into (hopefully) are brand new


On July 15th they told me I could come in and finish the paperwork for the apartment, as well as.  I obliged, and went and finished this paperwork and was told to come back on Monday (the 18th to sign the lease).  I go back on Monday and they say that move in has been moved to wednesday (the 20th) but I could still have my keys. I took the keys (thinking it was a little weird) and went to see the apartment.  The keys didn't work.  I called them and they said just to go back on the next day and swap the keys out for the right ones while I sign my lease and move in.  So i return on thursday, sign the lease, and get new keys.  I sign the lease and pay the security deposit and the first months Pro-rated rent.  At this time I go to try the keys again....again they do not work.  I go back to the apartment office and tell them.  They say they are going to get the lock redone, and I can pick the keys up Friday and move in.  I go on Friday, and they say that I can not actually move in because it has not been inspected by the Fire department.  Move in was set for Monday now.  However, that if I wanted to go ahead and move my stuff into the apartment that would be fine....but that I was not allowed to live there.  I couldnt do that since my lock wasnt working, however, the other people in the complex decided to start moving in.  Today rolls around, I have no keys, no apartment, and have already paid rent so I'm a little testy.  I go to pick up the keys and the lady tells me that the FD is going to inspect around 12pm (this was around 8).  I pick up my keys, and call back around 12pm (as they told me I could not be in or NEAR the apartment complex until after inspection.  I, however, was apparently one of very FEW who got that message.  Lots of people have moved in...Lots of people have been staying there.)  I was told that the fire department was now inspecting at 230pm today and I could move in at 5pm.  I call back to verify this information at 4pm, but was told the inspection was still going on and i would get a text saying when I could move in....but that it should still be 5pm.  530 rolls around and no text so i call the office....of course they are gone.  I text the property manager (because she has been texting me in regards to this information) and was told that the inspector was upset that people had been living there and would not give them paperwork.  I ask what I should do with all of my packed up stuff in the back of my car, and that being told every day for a week that 'tomorrow' is the day I can move into an apartment I have already paid for is frustrating.  'I can not tell you a time tomorrow because the inspector is being an ass' was the response I got.

Reddit.  I have a signed lease, i have paid rent, and have keys to a building that is not in code.  

Is there anything I should do?  Anything I need to do?  I really need this apartment since i currently live with my wife in my parents basement but i believe renting a place that hasn't been inspected or cleared is illegal.  What do I do....or should I just keep my mouth shut?

TL;DR - After signing a lease and paying rent and getting keys, apartment management isn't letting me live in the apartment because it has yet to get inspection papers",,False,,t5_2qhlj,False,,,True,t3_izq33,http://www.reddit.com/r/ask/comments/izq33/advice_about_a_rental_dispute_sort_of_needed/,

Crazy neighbor [possible sex offender], Advice Needed",6,1,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/ask/comments/iysur/help_crazy_neighbor_possible_sex_offender_advice/,"My wife and I have lived above this grade A+ asshole for the past 6 months and everyday is a challenge[we're both in our late twenties, he's in his 50's].  Unfortunately our complex has assigned parking spots, and of course his assigned 'covered spot' is next to ours.  He decides to park his large tundra next to my wife's small BMW in spots that are not large at all, and has caused no less than 3 dents in just her passenger side door, along with numerous other nicks and scratches.  My wife's car also has a handicap tag so there is no other chance of dents, and we have pictures of her paint on his truck, and off the cuff the approximate heights of the paint on the edge of his truck lines up with the dents on her car.  He is extremely confrontational, aggressive and slightly intimidating, especially to a woman much less me with a little fighting experience under my belt :)

Part two, every time we water our plants on our balcony, he comes outside on his balcony and screams at us.  The plants all have trays under them to catch any overflow, however a few drops do tend to fall between the cracks of the patio wooden floor.  To give you all an idea of the patio, it's roof is a wooden lattice so its not covered and the floor is like a normal deck.  We are both reasonable people, and always try to be considerate of other people, but this is getting out of hand.  Also, he has contacted our landlord to say that he can hear my wife's heels on the floor and it disturbs him; this is complete garbage as my wife never wears heels in the house because most of them are a pain in the ass to wear to begin with.  We hear him and his wife fighting at all hours of the night, and we believe that he resembles a known sex offender in our area[he gives you the totally creepy vibe, you know what I'm talking about!]  Other neighbors that are retired and super nice are so afraid of this man that they refuse to let him inside their place after they remodeled the inside, and invited everyone else in the immediate area, lol.  

My wife and I are VERY happy where we are and don't wanna move, however the daily crap creates constant uneven stress.  Parking somewhere else is not an option as the spots are assigned, and management frankly doesn't care.  We will be towed if we dont park in assigned spots.

Company ""Anonymous Shitty Sellers"" a.k.a A.S.S. decides to go public.  A.S.S. decides to divide control of the company into 1,000 shares, to sell 300 of those shares and that each share is worth $20, the remaining 700 shares are split amoung the employees.  All 300 shares of A.S.S. sell for $20 and a few weeks later they are selling for $35.  Now, I understand that the original $20*300=$6,000 profit for the company to invest in new products or whatever, but as the price of stocks increase from $20 to $25 eventually up to $35 over the weeks, how has the company benefited at all?

The reason I am assuming that the company cares at all is that companies REALLY want to keep their own stock prices high and when the stocks go down in price I always hear that the company is worth less than it was previously.  But if every stock is owned by a human being, how does the stock price affect the company?

Another example to show my faulty understanding is A.S.S. sells all stocks initially for $20 each, after a few months rumors start to spread that A.S.S. will declare bankruptcy so the stock price plummets.  A.S.S. keeps doing business and keeps making profit on its own ignoring what the stock prices are doing.

A few weeks ago, we were in a car accident during a move to a new house. We were rear-ended but we weren't injured in the slightest. Because of this I had to use my college savings for the new moving truck. The insurance company had sent my mother two checks to pay for the damages. One for $5500 and another for $3100. Now since she her bank isn't in our state, I offered to put them in my bank account and transfer it to her account. We had to wait for my savings account clear the checks, I was spending time with my grandfather is Mass. While I was down there I decided to check the bank account and saw that the two checks cleared. So I called up my mother and told her I was transferring the eight grand into her account. She was completely ecstatic. Not thinking much about it, I continued on my week with my grandfather. It wasn't till I returned to my house that I saw that my savings account was $3100 negative. I was freaking out. I saw that one of the checks was returned due to it being voided. I immediately called my mother on the way up to tell her to put the money into the account. She told her that it would be fine and she will transfer it in the morning. When we went to my bank I read that she was only giving me $1100. I was incredibly pissed. She told me that she has no intentions to pay off the rest of it since I will be living on my own with my cousin in a few months. And today I decided that since she owes me $2213.04 dollars, that I would stop doing the dishes. She threatened to kick me out of the house. My sister told her to stop doing my laundry. When I told her that she was being unreasonable she told me she didn't care. I yelled that she was being a shitty parent, she responded again that she doesn't care. I have no other place to go until February. Once February hits the corner I will be able to move in with my cousin who set me up with a well paying job. But I still have 6/7 months that I have to spend with my mother. I can't move in with my grandfather because my father is sleeping in the guest room. I have no where to turn to.

I'm horrible at writing things like this, so I'll try to get to the point. (I'm also ADHD and full of ideas, usually starting multiple sentences at once - please, bear with me.)

I am a 24 yr old dreamer from a large, very poor family in a small ho-dunk town in Florida, who has spent the last 7 yrs of her life basically working in the same call center before being layed off due to outsourcing in the middle of last year (2012). Since I was old enough to hold a crayon, I have been drawing/creating/dreaming up things. I have quite a niche for seeing things other people can't see, and bringing out the treasure in what would otherwise be seen as trash. (I'm horrible at articulating what I'm trying to say though, as you can probably tell...) While I excelled in my job at the call center, being promoted to a Supervisor position within the first 6 months, I was also absolutely miserable with my life and the lack of creation involved in the work. I eventually developed extreme anxiety issues, and came to realize that life wasn't worth living if you were doing something you hate doing. But, I stuck it out anyway since this was basically the only job available in my small town that didn't involve a name tag and a greasy apron. Being laid off was probably the best thing that could have happened to me. After a short stint being a house parent in another town for displaced/ juvenile delinquents, I decided to try to make money off of my creative abilities.

(I'm not sure if this is the best place to start a new paragraph, but the other one was getting large - so yeah...) I started by picking up furniture off the side of the road, and spending very little money out of pocket, fixing it up for my siblings as gifts, and using the photos as a portfolio for my possible business. After posting a few things I'd done for free, I slowly got messages from people who wanted me to do things for them, and was able to make a little money. When I say little, I mean people in this town basically wanted me to work for free. I'm never sure how much to charge for things, rather then the basic ""supplies"", but even then I was confused. Do I charge for brushes I already have? What about paint I already have? Its in my supplies but its using up my inventory... For example, I painted a firetruck dresser for a lady for $50, she provided the dresser, but asked I take care of paint/supplies/ect, which I thought would be ok, but I realized at the end of the week that after buying what I needed I was down $30, and since the dresser took about 15 hours of actual labor - I wasn't being paid very much per hour with the $20 revenue I would have made. So that was a lesson learned, but other things became harder - I wanted to work for people, but I had to constantly turn down jobs because my fiance at the time was becoming understandably upset at the amount of time/money I was losing for this dream I had.

Flash forward to today, I'm now living in Wisconsin, away from everyone I've ever known, with my new boyfriend in a small apartment. I've been up here for 7 months now, and have decided to give it one more shot at getting started in some sort of business before I go back to a dreaded life of call center hell. I've created a Facebook page, shared as much as possible, advertised on craigslist, and printed up flyers and advertised at all the local community bulletins. Unfortunately, I haven't gotten any responses. I think mainly it's because I'm not sure what to advertise, I don't even know what to call what I like to do... I've basically been calling it ""Carrie Confetti: Creative Mind for Hire"". Maybe it's because up here in the north my work isn't really as good as people think it is in the back roads town in Florida that I'm from. I honestly have no idea, but I'd love to hear some suggestions. Please, be as brutal as you need - if you think I should give up, and that my work is crappy, please tell me. I am open to all constructive criticism, I want to make this work.

started, what the type of work I want to do is even called, or what to charge.

Tomorrow I will be in the United State and would like to know wich gas station should I choose (wich one is better) ?.

I am from Canada and lots of people prefer a certain station, like Ultramar or Esso instead of Shell or MacEwen. MacEwen as a supposedly reputation of selling old gas (Mix of every almost empty tanks of any other station).

So, wich one should I choose?

I will be next to: 
- Irving 
- Mobil 
- Valero
- Sunoco
