Part of the goal was to encourage serious discussions of strategy regarding how to begin developing a mass movement on the left and overcome hurdles that too often reduce the idea of solidarity to something meaningless.

I would like to revive this more ambitious goal.  Surely there are people in this community who have good ideas that we could share as first steps.  I personally think the best start would be to just form multi-tendency discussion groups in our communities that focus more on immediate goals than differences of opinions on long term structural issues.  I also think those of us who support both electoral efforts and industrial unionism should start working to form [De Leonist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Leonism) tendencies in certain already existing parties to try to at least bridge the gap between democratic socialists and syndicalists as we simultaneously work to build an even more broad framework.

We also could get a lot of use out of restarting our zine, as has been discussed before.  We just need people to finally get involved again and start back submitting.  It has a lot of potential as a tool for sharing our ideas within the group and with the rest of the world.

I am looking forward to seeing feedback from people.  Remember, we have a world to win!",,False,,t5_2shjt,False,,,True,t3_u1c1u,http://www.reddit.com/r/alltheleft/comments/u1c1u/bringing_this_subreddit_back_to_its_roots/,moderator

By fostering debate, it would help fight back against the tendency some groups have to establish a party line and categorically reject criticism to it unexamined. it would also encourage cooperation in order to accomplish more and better things.

If people want to make this happen, we ought to discuss what form we want it to take and how to get there, and eventually begin implementing it. With that in mind, I created this subreddit.

If this is to be a legitimate coalition of the left, then you need to define 'the left' so that you can establish the basics so people can know what they are opting in to. I would argue that THE uniting factor of 'the left' is anti-capitalism (the definition of capitalism would need to be clarified if accepted). From MLM to @ to DemSoc to IndSoc we all oppose capitalism (whatever we consider it to be). This would also establish that we aren't centrists in favor of fixing capitalism. I'm usually not a fan of artificial unity, but I think a united action and education group wouldn't be inappropriate.

Also, if such a group was to exist it should not be a party or a union, but a network of anti-capitalist individuals organizing anti-capitalist actions both local and ideally global. We can then have a base for people who feel anti-capitalist sentiments to learn about the broad range of anti-capitalist movements and figure out where they stand.

I think the best initial actions such a hypothetical network would take would be setting short-, medium-, and long-term goals (short term being particular things (shutting down nuclear plants, interrupting IMF meetings, organizing a workplace, restructuring a cities constitution to be participatory democratic, etc.), medium term goals being social or chunked (social: redefine socialism and anarchism in the social conscious, chunked: stop all nuclear production, general strike, end globalization attempts, stop budget cuts etc.), long-term goals being the abolition of capitalism) and then acting in the short term and always keeping the long term in sight.

(Capitalism may be defined as: the means of production are held in the hands of those other than the producers/workers)

That's my tired and rambling contribution. If you do this, contact all the major socialist and anarchist organizations and internet gathering places and try to find an immediate short-term goal we can all agree on and set up the direct action to stop it and build from there...

Edit: I would simply like to add freedom of information (opposing capitalism's privatization of music, video, genetic code, designs, stories, etc.) as a strong point of collective anti-capitalist opposition that is particularly relevant right now. De-privatizing information would be a middle-term goal with particular actions being the short term ones and of course the end of capitalism being the long term goal.

Thanks to the commenter who brought it up!

Following that you could also have freedom of land (de-privatizing land and radio frequencies) and freedom of workplaces (de-privatizing factories and machines) as general goals (and perhaps a 'freedom of cash' to de-privatize banks and credit unions). The problem here is that these are still negative goals. What do you replace them with?

Just one thing to say before I call it an early night:,50,9,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/alltheleft/comments/ha9df/im_really_happy_to_see_how_this_subreddit_has/,"Remember that we are all comrades.  Whether someone is a social democrat, a democratic socialist like myself, a Trotskyist, or an anarchist, we are united on at least a few basic things. We wish to see no person suffering needlessly in a world of abundance. This includes those people ruined by poverty, militarism, unjust laws, and prejudices that have been heavily ingrained in our culture in many ways. An anarchist may wish to have nothing to do with the state, but how can she know that a demsoc or socdem or any other comrade might not be interested in working on a farming cooperative, a guerilla gardening project, or organizing a free store or any other type of constructive direct action to alleviate that suffering as well as pursuing electoral (or more radical but still statist) gains?  We have to be willing to try very hard to not make assumptions about one another.  We are in this together, regardless of our disagreements.  There are plenty of things we could all work together on if we just seek them out.

She's been arrested over 200 times for activist-related stuff, she's been homeless herself, she founded the Poor Peoples' Economic Human Rights Campaign, and now she wants to use the sheriff's office to help keep people in their homes and fight the banks.  

I realize that many people on ""all the left"" don't believe in electoral politics, many don't believe in the Green Party, and so on, but this is a truly exceptional campaign.  And I am not saying this just because I am involved - I'm just lucky enough to be part of this campaign.  To give you an idea of its potential, it's already brought in a more diverse group of people to the Green Party of Philly than I've ever seen, Cheri and our candidate for City Commissioner were recently part of a coalition that stopped an anti-homeless bill in City Council, we've had substantial press coverage, we forced a local civic group to cover the campaign, we had over 150 people at a campaign headquarters opening, the Democrat in the race (and Philly is one of the most corrupt Democrat-machine-controlled cities out there) has changed his signs to white and green, and the energy I've seen has been unbelievable.  And this is before things really heat up.

I'm not the only one who believes this, either.  Take a look at what the Green Party's 2004 presidential candidate said about the campaign:  http://www.cherihonkala.com/?p=612

There are also house parties happening all over the country to support the campaign.  So far, I know of two that happened - one in LA and one in Minneapolis, Cheri's hometown.

So take a look at the website ( http://cherihonkala.com ), please make a donation if you can, come to Philly and volunteer if you can (a fellow redditor is actually moving to Philly from Denver to help!), keep up to date with it, spread the word on the internet, contribute art or some other talent to the campaign, whatever!

This deserves national attention.",51,16,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/alltheleft/comments/tgmi5/today_it_was_revealed_that_mitt_romney_bullied/,"Why?  Because we elect Presidents based not only for their skill sets, but also according to how we feel about them in the office, how they reflect our values and what we think each one will be able to teach younger generations as our country's top role model.  In fact, it can be argued personal character is the *main* reason most Presidents win election.  And character is as evident in our adolescence as it is relevant in the White House.

[Today in the *Washington Post*](http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/mitt-romneys-prep-school-classmates-recall-pranks-but-also-troubling-incidents/2012/05/10/gIQA3WOKFU_story.html?tid=pm_politics_pop), Romney's former prep school classmates - ""who gave their accounts independently of one another"" - recounted his attitude and dealings with a student who was presumed to be gay.

&gt; John Lauber, a soft-spoken new student one year behind Romney, was perpetually teased for his nonconformity and presumed homosexuality. Now he was walking around the all-boys school with bleached-blond hair that draped over one eye, and Romney wasn’t having it.

&gt; “He can’t look like that. That’s wrong. Just look at him!” an incensed Romney told Matthew Friedemann, his close friend in the Stevens Hall dorm, according to Friedemann’s recollection. Mitt, the teenaged son of Michigan Gov. George Romney, kept complaining about Lauber’s look, Friedemann recalled.

&gt; A few days later, Friedemann entered Stevens Hall off the school’s collegiate quad to find **Romney marching out of his own room ahead of a prep school posse shouting about their plan to cut Lauber’s hair.** Friedemann followed them to a nearby room where **they came upon Lauber, tackled him and pinned him to the ground. As Lauber, his eyes filling with tears, screamed for help, Romney repeatedly clipped his hair with a pair of scissors.**

Critics of the article may point out this paragraph:

&gt; The men have differing political affiliations, although they mostly lean Democratic. Buford volunteered for Barack Obama’s campaign in 2008. Seed, a registered independent, has served as a Republican county chairman in Michigan. All of them said that politics in no way colored their recollections.

However, all five of those interviewed are today successful, professional men (a dentist, a lawyer, a retired prosecutor and a retired principal, along with a fifth man who asked to remain anonymous), and as previously noted, spoke of their recollections independently.  Five witnesses, speaking separately, all saying the same thing.

&gt; “It was a hack job,” recalled Maxwell, a childhood friend of Romney who was in the dorm room when the incident occurred. “It was vicious.”

&gt; The incident transpired in a flash, and Friedemann said **Romney then led his cheering schoolmates** back to his bay-windowed room in Stevens Hall. 

&gt; Friedemann, guilt ridden, made a point of not talking about it with his friend and waited to see what form of discipline would befall Romney at the famously strict institution. **Nothing happened.**

This is the guy running for our President.  A coldhearted, homophobic bully.  And he wants to lead our nation.

If character matters in the White House, few revelations (particularly coming on the heels of North Carolina's Amendment One vote and President Obama's coming out in favor gay marriage) can shed more light on who Mitt Romney really is.

I know many others in this subreddit feel the same way.  Even though I do not feel like support for Democrats is well placed here, I am generally against the removal of posts.  I would prefer that people like myself keep speaking up with their criticisms of the Democrats and use the posts as an opportunity to have real discussions about the lack of genuine opposition to the status quo.

To go along with this, I would ask those who insist on making posts in support of the Democratic Party not downvote these criticisms into oblivion.  Not to sound overly blunt, but you should have expected them when you came here.

To balance things out a bit, I would love for people to start posting information about other genuinely leftist parties.  I am going to try to get some stuff up from the SPUSA soon and would be happy to see information from other parties, even if I don't necessarily agree with them personally.  The dialogue between everyone is good to have.

Edit:  I just realized that my original post was a bit biased toward statists, since it only invited people to speak out in favor of various political parties.

**The working group's mission statement:**
The purpose of the Vision and Goals working group is to create a long-term, comprehensive vision of what we would like the future to look like, and how we can shape that future. In order to be a true reflection of the movement we want our process to involve everyone’s input.

With over 100,000 radicalized users who troll the new section of /r/politics and downvote anything they consider antigun, the frontpage of reddit has largely been supportive of the NRA position and therefore silent despite the massacre at Sandy Hook.

A few months ago, my friends and I created a sub so that we could lampoon the extreme positions gun owners take.  There is no counter to /r/guns on reddit.  So we decided to make one.  We had fun, until about a week ago when a post on /r/guns highlighted **/r/gunsarecool**, and every single post dating back three months was downvoted into the negatives, wiping them from the front page.  The raid is ongoing.

I was threatened with doxxing on an account that I had maintained for two years that had personal information on it.  So I deleted that one and created this one.

I am not asking for a personal army, and I have not asked for help from anyone up until this point.  Actually, I am not sure what to do.  You don't have to go anywhere or do anything.  Right now I am putting some feelers out to subreddits that I think may be supportive.  So if you have a minute, please go there and subscribe if you like what you see.  Submit, laugh, and upvote like anywhere else on reddit.  Let others know about it or put a link in the sidebar.  And feel free to give us advice on what to do next.

Recently I (F / 20 / left-leaning) had a somewhat uncomfortable discussion with a friend (F / 24 / radical) about improving politics by working within the system versus through revolutionary change. It was uncomfortable because she makes distinct value judgments (i.e. certain things are ""evil"") whereas my tendency is to take a doubtful, gray, tempered position on everything (maybe it's a cop-out). I thought the main problem was willful ignorance on the part of people who should know better; she thought the main problem was the capitalist complex. I think she believes in radical sensitivity whereas I tend to view political correctness as counterproductive sometimes.

I think a lot of the dissension is due to us having come from vastly different backgrounds. We're both ethnically Chinese, but she is American-born while I am a so-called 1.5-generation naturalized Chinese-American. You may find it strange that I'm writing to you about my frustrations. So I guess my question is, could you provide me with some book recommendations on the New Left, and on post-60's leftist movements? I feel like I'm not very grounded in this discussion and would like to know where some of my friends are coming from.

I've seen this figure as high as 260 million. It includes victims of the Nazis (because calling yourself a socialist for purely propaganda reasons makes it true, apparently) as well as deaths caused by corruption, inefficiency, and oppression in the Soviet Union and People's Republic of China.

But I'm curious, what if we gave capitalism similar treatment? How many people have been killed by capitalism? Let's not go as far as the communist haters have. Let's try to be accurate rather than pulling the largest number possible out of our asses.

I think it would be appropriate to include deaths caused by poverty in capitalist countries, deaths from the slave trade for countries where slaves were private property, deaths caused by 19th and early 20th century colonialism by capitalist countries, deaths among American Indians at the hands of the United States, wars started by capitalist countries over such things as resources or debt, counterrevolutionary violence and crackdowns against peaceful protests in capitalist countries, and extrajudicial killings in capitalist countries.

EDIT: Just to make sure this is clear, I'm not 100% serious here. My main point is that the assertion that socialism is somehow a killer ideology is completely ridiculous.

They have been failures since the election of Clinton and they continue to fall further in their failure as they embrace Right-wing values. No one sane or observant could ever dispute that truth. 

That is why we the left, from radical socialists, such as myself, to the soft left liberals need to come together and create a revolution. What I am advocating is not violent overthrow, but a change in thought. We the left need to put aside our petty squabbles and create a revolutionary party to educate and promote real leftist values. We need to come together for the common and greater good, not for lesser evils. We have too long sold our souls to devils in angelic garb that we have lost ourselves but now is a time to find ourselves once more. 

We have become confused by the petty issues the forces in power feed to us instead of focusing on the issues that matter in order to bring about a more just, freer society. 

We should be focusing on:

Human Rights: 
-The rights of all humans to live independently without government or other groups dictating their lifestyle. 
-Free speech which means all speech is protected even speech you or I might disagree with because when you censor one it leads to censorship for all.
-The rights of workers to fight for better working conditions and fairer pay. 

Economic Equality:
-This does no mean redistributionism but that someone born in a poor area has just as much chance of surviving and thriving in the world as someone born in an affluent one. 
-A fair tax code.
-A reduction in unemployment, this is something that can never be truly eliminated, there will always be unemployed due to a variety of reasons including not wanting to work or disability and even the introduction of new technologies.
-Free, fair and comprehensive education including a reform of schools into a more democratic model, because it is at schools where one truly learns how to be a citizen. This schooling shall be free through the university (baccalaureate) level and shall pay for itself due to an increase in skilled workers and innovators. 
-We should strive to break up companies with too large a hold on sectors of the economy.
-If a ""too big to fail"" is failing it should be allowed to.
-Cooperatives should be more well known and easier to form and we should strive to have them replace top-down corporations as the preferred choice for businesses.
-There should be a cap on the amount that CEOs make adjusted to the profits a company makes as well as a minimum wage adjusted to the cost of living in our most expensive locale with both adjusted for inflation.

A Sustainable Future:
-Contrary to the Alarmists in the Environmentalist camp I won't say that what's going on is entirely humanity's fault because that's patently, and has been demonstrated scientifically, to be untrue. Humans have however had a great hand in it so yes while the environment does go through hot and cold periods we have been speeding this one up.
-We should undertake to reduce our footprint on the environment and endeavor to guide other nations to do the same.
-We should look seriously at all forms of environmentally safe energy sources including Thorium nuclear reactors.
-We should endeavor to abandon all non-safe materials by the year 2065 except for purposes where environmental impact is minimal.
-We should strive to get chemicals out of our foods and drink that are unnecessary and detrimental to our overall health.

My thoughts aren't all thought out but that is why I'm here to gather like-minded souls who want to see true change, and who can add on to these few fundamentals in search of a brighter future. Because the greater good will always win in the end.

And remember, progress not profits,

Bulgarian Anarchist Manifesto (1945)

PLATFORM OF THE FEDERATION OF ANARCHIST COMMUNIST OF BULGARIA

WE REJECT THE PRESENT SOCIAL SYSTEM OF State and capitalist centralization, as it founded on the principle of the state which is contrary to the initiative and freedom of the people. Every form of power involves economic, political or spiritual privilege. It's application on an economic level is represented by private property, on a political level by the state, and on a spiritual level by religion. These three forms of are linked. If you touch one, the others are changed and, inversely, you keep one form of power, it will inevitably lead to the re-establishment of the other two. This why we repudiate the very principle of power.

We are supporters of the abolition of private property, of the State and of religion, and of the total suppression of every form and institution of constraint and violence. We reject every teaching and every social, political and economic-political movement aimed at maintaining the State, private property, the church and constraint and violence in social relations.

We repudiate fascism, which is a historic attempt to restore absolutism, autocracy and the strength of the political form of power with the aim of defending economic and spiritual dominance of the privileged classes.

We reject political democracy, as it does not foresee the disappearance of the principle of power, and drives the masses to bewilderment by leading them, through lies and illusions, into fights which are against their interests, and corrupts them through the exercise of power and the maintaining of the appetite for Domination. Political democracy furthermore, shows that it is totally incapable of solving the great social problems and that it fosters chaos, contradictions and crime as a result of its social foundations based on the centralized State and capitalism.

We repudiate State socialism as it leads to State capitalism--the most monstrous form of economic exploitation and oppression, and of total domination of social and individual freedom.

We are for anarchist communism or free communism, which will replace private property with the complete socialization of lands, factories and mines, and of all goods and services of production. The State will be replaced by the federation of free communes regionally, provincially, nationally and internationally united. The church and religion will be replaced by a free individual moral and scientific vision.

Unlike all other socio-economic and political concepts and organizations, Anarchist-Communism is federalist.

The new social organization that will replace the State will be built and run from the bottom upwards. All the inhabitants of any given village will form the local free commune, and all the local free communes will unite regionally, provincially, nationally and internationally in unions and federations and in a universal general social confederation.

The new organization of society's production will be formed by a close network of countless local agricultural enterprises, artisans, mines, industry, transport, etc,. united on a regional, provincial, national and international level in production unions and federations as part of a general confederation of productions.

Society's new organization of exchange, consumption and supply will likewise be represented by a dense and complex network of regional, provincial and national organizations, unions and federations, grouped in a general confederation of exchange and consumption for satisfying the needs of all inhabitants.

All human social activity and all transport, communications, education, healthcare, and so on, will be organized in similar fashion.

With this organizational system of all the functions of the carious aspects of social life, there will be no place in society for the power of one individual over another or for the exploitation of one by another.

The basic principle of production and distribution for the building of the new social system will be: everyone will produce according to their possibilities and everyone will receive according to their needs.

The realization of this social ideal of equality, solidarity and freedom can only be brought about by the united workers and peasant masses, inspired by anarchist communism and organized into ideological, professional, exchange, consumption, cultural and education groups.

Anarchist communism, in the course of repudiating of the State, rejects the involvement of the workers in the administrative bodies and institutions of the State, in parliament and in any vote for the official management of the state.

As the sole means of efficient struggle, as a defense of the immediate interests of the working masses, and for the realization of the full ideal of humanity's freedom, anarchism recognizes on the direct action of the workers themselves, initiated by their economic organizations and expressed through strikes, sabotages, boycotts, general strikes, insurrections and the social revolution. In consequences, anarchism rejects all form of organization and struggle by political parties, considering the, sterile and ineffective, unable to respond to the goals and immediate tasks to the interest of the workers in the towns and cities, The true strength of the workers is in the economy and their economic organizations. Only there lies the terrain where capitalism can be undermined. Only there lies the true class struggle...

Organizational decisions within anarchist communist organizations are made unanimously, and not by the majority. The decisions of the majority is not binding on the minority; persuasion should always be sought. In practice, the minority generally rallies to the decision of the majority, which reserves the right to express the correctness of its positions, once it has been demonstrated in fact. Thanks to this principle, which is widely applied within the anarchist movement, splits, enmities, and arguments are rare.

However, within the mass economic organizations and other organizations, decisions are taken by the majority vote and are binding, as only in this way can unity be achieved, unity that is absolutely indispensable in the mass organizations. But in certain cases where there is profound disagreement, the minority may be freed from the obligation to apply a general decision, on condition that it does not present the execution of such a decision...

As you know, Apple products such as iPad, iPhone, iPod touch, contain an app called iBooks. IBooks displays material as ePub (electronic publication), **just as iTunes plays music in mp3, iBooks shows books in ePub**. Makes sense? You will be looking for ePub links when you want to download a book. 


Just like iTunes, you can download books from apple and read them digitally. What's that you say? ""Do I have to go through Apple and buy a book from read them?"" 


**Nay!** Here's how to read your favorite anarchist writers in about three easy steps. 


**Step 1**: on your iDevice, head on over to the Anarchist Library and browse through all the authors you'd like to read...


**http://theanarchistlibrary.org/author-index.html**


**Step 2**: choose an author and title of book you'd like. 


**Step 3**: after choosing the book you want to read, on the top left corner where you will find the author, publishing date, title, genre, etc,...just below that you will find a selection of buttons to click on to open the material with (adobe, HTML, ePub) or you can just read the whole book right there....click on **""ePub""**, you will be taken to a page and in the top right corner you will see **""open in iBooks""**click that button and you're done, you've downloaded the book to your iDevice. 


**Note** that you can do this same process over on **http://www.gutenberg.org/**, where you can read **TONS** books for free and selecting **ePub** after finding a book you want. And this process is **completely legal** because the copyrights for authors have expired and is now considered public information. **Enjoy!**

http://unitetheleft.tumblr.com/

Rather than being just another 'leftist reblog' account, I would like to create a space for conversation about content promoting or critiquing the ideas of left unity and how this can be achieved. Tumblr has a decent-sized left community and I think there is a place for this there. If you write a blog or produce original content on the subject, you can submit it to us and we can post it for discussion.

If anyone wants to be a contributor, feel free to leave a comment here or send me a PM. My vision for this is to be a way to outreach to the many different left communities on Tumblr (and around the internet, really) to have a consistent place to converge and share ideas about how we can advance left unity. Kinda like this subreddit, but in more of a curated blog form.

If you don't want to be a contributor but you still have ideas/critiques, feel free to let me know here. Or, you can submit them to the blog by following the link on the page.

I was raised in a poor, relatively conservative family who has only increasingly fallen into poverty as I've grown into my 20's and moved out of their household. Largely through Occupy, and my heightened interest in politics I have successfully educated myself in this vein, but I feel dejected by my experience last night. Everyone in attendance was relatively privileged and educated (graduate school, etc) and I've only barely finished an associate's degree due to my socioeconomic difficulties.

We came up with several ideas, the most immediate of these being the creation of a blog and forum to serve as an independent information outlet and discussion tool for our group.  This would allow for easy dissemination of information and materials on all sides.

 

**Also:**

 

- Post tear tab fliers with party contact info on public bulletin boards at universities, colleges, community centers, libraries, etc.

 

- Provide moral support any future strikes that may happen in the state by taking food and drinks out to the picket line for the striking workers.

 

- Look into the logistics of starting up or getting involved in a blanket drive around Thanksgiving and going through winter/the holiday season. The idea was to buy a lot of sturdy light blankets (think like the ones the Army uses) and screen print them with the party logo before distributing them. We figured that while we were working with screen printing with that it would probably be good to go ahead and try to screen print some t shirts too for when we are out and about and especially when we are doing volunteer work.

 

- Other less seasonal work we could do with the homeless. Like go out on as regular of basis as possible and give free water in the summer and coffee in the fall and winter. It was suggested that we could home print paper slips for these with little blurbs about party goals, news, and information about public resources they can seek out. Also work on voter registration drives and getting people to the polls.

 

- Look at venues and musicians we know about in Huntsville and Tuscaloosa to try to organize shows where people donate canned food as part of their cover charge. It would show us out helping to create events people enjoy while simultaneously doing good in the community.

 

- Look at venues for hosting Free Stores.  Allow people to come together to meet their needs in a way that does not squeeze resources from them.

 

- Start donating books to prison library systems with information on an inside cover encouraging people to contact us about assistance in filling out the forms needed for felons to have their voting rights returned.

 

**Longer term goals:**

 

- Form a consumer cooperative to reduce financial hardship of members by allowing for large bulk buying.

 

- Eventually form a cooperatively managed business to provide a very tangible example of our ideals.

 

**Party structure discussion:**

 

- Comrade R.F. is going to look into what exactly would be the best route for us in terms of getting a charter.

 

- Discussed the formation of locals. It was proposed that Arab, Decatur, and Cullman all be in a regional local at least for the time being. The same idea was discussed to a lesser extent regarding Birmingham and Tuscaloosa.

 

- Consensus was reached that it would be better to wait about selecting a state executive after we have drawn in more interest, but it was also agreed that a minimalist executive might be the best approach. Something like a chair, vice-chair, and secretary or chair, co-chair, and secretary.

 

- Future scheduling for meetings will be done much more ahead of time to give more people an opportunity to plan for attendance.  This first meeting was planned on short notice mainly to just go ahead and get things rolling and provide a loose framework.",,False,,t5_2shjt,True,,,True,t3_jy3ag,http://www.reddit.com/r/alltheleft/comments/jy3ag/first_meeting_of_the_socialist_party_of_alabama/,

Perhaps people that live close by can meet up and build regional organizations. I'm also thinking we should know about the 2012 elections. We should get an idea of who is running and try to find the most progressive candidates from our area to support. Of course, who you want to support would be entirely up to the ones organizing in the specific regions, but we should help each other out with resources. 

This is a good start to see who is running for the senate: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_elections,_2012

Here's the one for the House:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives_elections,_2012

It's still really early, and this was really the best tool I could find so far. If you have any better tools to find candidates for next year's elections post it! I'm thinking the primaries are going to be key. We have to let the Democratic party know that we want candidates who will stand up for leftist values. 

What do you all think? I'm living in Austin, TX right now, but I will be moving to New York City in July. Where are you all from?

**EDIT:** I apologize for this seeming US centric. I am totally for an international movement that goes beyond elections. I was so pumped about this sub reddit and had an idea so that's where this post came from. Anyway, I think my main point is that we should use this sub reddit as sort of a ""Main Headquarters"" of the movement. At least for right now. Finding out where we are all from helps see where we can meet up and create regional organizations. I think part of the goal of the regional organizations could be to support progressive candidates, but also recruit other lefties. Now, how the movement will look I think should depend on the regional organizations. We should use the ""Headquarters"" as a place to report what your region is doing and help support other regions, sharing ideas, maybe even traveling to other sites. I'm just throwing this stuff out there.

Do you guys think we should make a separate thread for this? ",,False,,t5_2shjt,True,,,True,t3_hbhwx,http://www.reddit.com/r/alltheleft/comments/hbhwx/geography_of_all_the_left/,

* [_Looking Backward From 2000 to 1887_](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/624/624-h/624-h.htm) by Edward Bellamy.

* [_Equality_](http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext05/equal10h.htm) by Edward Bellamy (the sequel to _Looking Backward_ above).

* [_The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists_](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/3608/3608-h/3608-h.htm) by Robert Tressell.

These are by far the three best books I have ever read. In addition I'd recommend reading the following essays:


* [_Why Socialism?_](http://monthlyreview.org/2009/05/01/why-socialism) by Albert Einstein.

* [_Thoughts On The World Economic Crisis_](http://www.marxistoutlook.com/article19.htm) by Albert Einstein.

* [_In Praise Of Idleness_](http://www.zpub.com/notes/idle.html) by Bertrand Russell.

These essays all reasonably short and easy to read.

So I went to my Congresswoman's office in DC back in May and left her a note asking why she continued to support the PATRIOT Act. After almost eleven weeks and a few phone calls, she wrote back:
&gt;""I share your concern about maintaining our civil liberties, and realize we must strike a balance between the needs of our government and the protections guaranteed to us in the Constitution. I supported the reauthorization of the Patriot Act because I believe we must ensure our law enforcement professionals continue to have the tools necessary to protect Americans both here and abroad.""

My response (I hand wrote it for funsies):

Dear Jean,

Thank you for your response. I appreciate that you took the time to write back to me. I am, however, rather disappointed by your rationale for continuing to support the PATRIOT Act.

You emphasized that “a balance” must be struck “between the needs of our government and the protections guaranteed to us in the Constitution.” I think this fundamentally misunderstands the nature of rights. The rights we are given in the Constitution are not negotiable. Our rights are not something to be limited, to be balanced against “the needs of government.” We have rights specifically to protect us from these “needs of government.” Our rights are a “guarantee” – they are neither negotiable, negatable, nor subject to “balancing.”

History looks unfavorably upon those who have limited our rights for a temporary “need of government.” Need I remind you of the Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798, denounced by a House Judiciary Committee in 1832 as unconstitutional? Need I remind you of the Espionage Act of 1917 or the Sedition Act of 1918? Did you consider these historic violations of citizens’ rights before you voted to affirm and extend such an act?

Perhaps though I am mistaken in my understanding of our rights. As a student of history, ancient and modern, I have come to see that the needs of government are inherently transitory, and that rights must be enduring. Rights cannot be compromised for the short-term benefit of the government; they must be truly “guaranteed” to the people. If I am mistaken here, will you kindly correct me?

After re-reading your letter I am afraid that I cannot in good conscience support you any longer. You have violated your oath of office – you have failed to protect the United States Constitution and my rights as a citizen. You have failed to use your national voice to stand up for me and 307 million of my fellow countrymen. For that, I am severely disappointed and must formally withdraw my support.

So, I'm very glad you like the first issue of the All the Left zine, and am grateful to everyone who contributed so we could actually get it off the ground. A few have emailed and messaged me asking how to get more involved, and I really want this to be a more collaborative effort, so here are some things the zine needs:

- Submitters

This is pretty obvious, but if we want the zine to be a monthly occurrence, we need a lot of content. This can be a variety of things - essays, artwork, suggested reading lists, poetry, stories, comics, etc. I think it would be great to have some DIY tutorials (how to make a zine, how to start a podcast, how to organize a rally, how to use IRC anonymously, etc.) so if you can't think of what to write, that may be a good place to start.

- Editors

Given that the first issue had several errors, we need to have lots of eyes on the issues before we release it. While zines may be notorious for not worrying about grammar and the like, I think our messages will be taken seriously if we can be professional about it. There are a few editors on board but the more the merrier.

- Designers

I love doing book/zine design, but if others have a passion for design, please feel free to make some pages to put in the issue. I use InDesign to put it all together, and as of now the dimensions are 6x9 in. Please ensure that your images are all at least 300 ppi. 

Also, feel free to submit cover images!

- Distributors

I think it would be awesome to distribute the zine throughout the far corners of the interwebs, so please share it with anyone and everyone. Also, if anyone wants to help make the e-zine more printer-friendly (as well as in HTML), that would be greatly appreciated.

Okay that's all I can think of for now, please comment or PM me with ideas, input and suggestions. The blog has the Submission form (on the Zine page). If you want to be a moderator on the blog, PM me with your email and I will add you on.

My questions on how do we support each other when some of our views are so incompatible:

* Will a socialist vote or work in solidarity with a liberal/social democrat to relieve immediate suffering even if it does not directly address real socialist goals?  Example: The recent American health care reform.
* Will a revolutionary socialist vote or work in solidarity with a democratic socialist in order to forward a minor socialist reform?  Example: Some sort of subsidy in order to encourage workplace democracy/cooperatives.
* Will an anarchist vote or work in solidarity with another leftist to assist people/communal interests even if that means establishing an institution/hierarchy used to defend those people/interests?  Example: Unions, OSHA, FDA, EPA.

movement with leftist goals but dropping most 
leftist methods?",18,2,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/alltheleft/comments/vfuqq/spanish_lost_soul_here_is_there_any_modern/,"I'm Spanish and we are currently pretty screwed up by banks and the politizians we voted. There's a lot of rage and hate in the population right now but nobody is able to channel it at all. I think most people would like to jail current politicians and let banks go bankrupt, but there's no union on the left at all to achieve it.

These are the main problems I see for which people in our country don't turn to the left at all, even thought most of us can agree with their goals:

**Leftist political parties**

* One of our main political party is leftist
* Economically they do basically the same as the right, except unions don't protest when they are in power
* They are as corrupt as the right
* In social rights they are better
* The minor leftist parties all that seem to want is to spend money on social causes, without detailing where's that money coming from
* They are also pretty corrupt wherever they get some power

**Unions**

* They shut up as long as the left corrupt party is in power
* They don't fight much for the general population jobs
* They defend some highly paid public employees. What's the point of defending decent jobs if the rest of the society has to pay for them and has shitty jobs?
* They are pretty corrupt too, some people basically have a Union career and positions are distributed amongst friends

**More extreme ideologies**

* They seem to have very ""enemy oriented"" methods but what will they do once there's no enemy? People aren't going to change their natures just because you destroy the current power
* People don't think anymore that there's any intrinsic difference between rich people and poor people except for their economical situation. People aren't going to rely in any liberator.
* They never show any long-term successful different societies. There's very little efford in creating them except for some squatters and that doesn't appeal to people in general.

If we opt for a (presumably US) national focus, I would argue that we fail to recognize that we are operating in a global system, and that many of our local and national struggles are aspects of international ones. Nations don't operate in isolation. Economic and political doctrines, theories and ideologies are only rarely confined to one country. Corporations span the globe. What may appear to be isolated circumstances in one particular place are often part of a global pattern. National identities serve to obscure just how much we have in common and how interconnected our circumstances are.

On a somewhat more practical level, making this an international movement would prevent us from excluding people who don't happen to be in the USA, and would allow us to coordinate international actions and learn from people elsewhere in the world.

I propose that we firmly establish that this ought to be international in nature, but in no way prevent it from being used to organize national or local level actions and initiatives. What does everyone think?

Edit: In response to evilrobonixon2012 and Ridersonstorm, I would like to modify my proposal slightly to more clearly establish national and local organizing on issues of those scopes, without detracting from the international level.",,False,,t5_2shjt,True,,,True,t3_hbnbq,http://www.reddit.com/r/alltheleft/comments/hbnbq/national_or_international/,

Reading the front page of reddit, I see people are completely outraged about what is going on economically and politically in the world right now. Lots of these people seem to be the ones who voted for Obama expected real change, and are now really disillusioned that nothing is getting better. The few politicians that ARE praised on here are the ones that are about as far as you can get to the left in US politics, people like Dennis Kucinich and Bernie Sanders (who identifies as a socialist) This could just be my optimistic analysis and let me know if you think I'm wrong, but it feels to me like there are many people who are already agitated.

Now, I guess I'd like to do a little brainstorming of the best way to educate. I think there are many people who already have the values of communism/socialist/anarchism, but are either unaware of the ""actual left"" or have so many misconceptions about it that they don't want to be a part of it.

* She didn't understand why there's a North *and* a South Korea

* She didn't know what the Federal Reserve is

* She believed we invaded Iraq in 2003 because Saddam Hussein attacked America on 9/11

* She couldn't distinguish the reasons between invading Afghanistan and Iraq

* She believed Queen Elizabeth II is the British head of government

There are a couple stages to this, it is about jury nullification.

There are a couple stages necessary from where it seems we are right now.

**1)** Establish the proper and correct terminology to discuss and explain and educate others on this issue. I am not a lawyer. If you are or know one will would be willing to provide legal advice to assist with making sure we use only correct and verifiable information in executing the following steps, please post.

**2)** We will also need people talented with digital arts to help create flyers and advertising and resources for a website. It should at this point be an issue of layout and not content if we will first seek to refine the message.

**3)** Boots on the ground. Once we have the properly advised information we will need to disseminate it. I think flyers are optimal for this since we are ideally trying to target people outside reddit's demographic (high internet consuming adult males under 35 or whatever). Perhaps organization of protests with placards. But this phase is really grass roots and can be as creative it wants. Just as long as we make sure to stick to only the properly confirmed information, otherwise we could undermine our work.


Am I crazy or is this something others actually want to help with?
