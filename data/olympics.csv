1343493568.0,2316,self.olympics,xawn1,"Thank you, NBC, for making the Olympics all but unwatchable in the United States.",3746,1430,801,http://www.reddit.com/r/olympics/comments/xawn1/thank_you_nbc_for_making_the_olympics_all_but/,"Let's start with the horrible coverage of the Opening Ceremonies. I get it. The viewing public in the United States are unwashed, uneducated morons who don't know anything about anything. That's why you needed the constant yammering of idiots to tell us exactly what was going on at all times instead of just letting us watch and enjoy the spectacle. You turned something that could have been culturally relevant and worthwhile into something boring and more like an episode of morning TV - which none of us wanted.

Now let's move to the actual sporting events that are on television. Okay, we get it - Michael Phelps and Ryan Lochte have a rivalry. But the coverage isn't all about them. There are 10,500 Olympic athletes (give or take) and we'd like to see more than just them. Oh, I understand we can see other things if we switch to Bravo or (MS)NBC or other channels, but you don't bother showing the whole matches, only snippets before you break away for your next ""human interest"" biopic. Fuck that.

So I went online and to my wife's iPad (I don't have one and am insanely jealous) and downloaded the app. *Here,* I thought, *I'd be able to watch the events that aren't mainstream and shoved down my throat.* Wrong. Each time you try and watch something they throw in an advertisement anywhere from 15-30 seconds. I can't tell you how many times they said something was live and after suffering through the same fucking ad the video showed an error and told me to pick something else...which meant watching the same stupid ads *AGAIN!!*

So fuck you, NBC. I wanted to watch the Olympics and I guess I can if I like swimming, gymnastics or the Dream Team. Oh, you wanted to watch Badminton? Better DVR that shit because we're only showing it at 5 am and on a channel in the mid-thousands. It's like the Where's Waldo of sporting events.

Fuck you, fuck you millions of ads, fuck the incessant rambling of announcers who tell us things that mean nothing and add nothing, fuck your not letting US choose what we want to watch and when. You think we're dumb? You think we don't KNOW the technology is already in place to allow us to watch anything and everything we want? But no, instead of giving us what we want you force-feed us what you think we'll watch the most and slather it with ads and stupidity.

tl;dr:

Fuck you, NBC.",,False,self,t5_21of,False,,,True,t3_xawn1,http://www.reddit.com/r/olympics/comments/xawn1/thank_you_nbc_for_making_the_olympics_all_but/,

However, there is a simple workaround which I have linked in the sidebar.

&gt;[Install Expatshield](http://www.expatshield.com/) or [Tunlr](http://tunlr.net/) to view the [BBC](http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/tv/bbc_one_london/watchlive) live stream.

So, moving forward, if someone asks for a way to view the Olympics please point them towards this. All future NBC threads will be deleted. The point is not to quell your outrage, but to prevent these repeated complaint threads from jamming up the front page.

Also some reminders since lots of people are getting it:

* No meme or image macro posts.
* No ""How I was feeling when"" posts
* Please check out the event threads on /r/olympicevents
* Donate to our [fundraiser for the Special Olympics](https://reddit.crowdtilt.com/campaigns/rolympics-fundraiser-for-the-special-olympics).

Golf should've never been added. 

It is not to say that any of these events don't take time or training or skill. I don't expect them to get discontinued anytime soon as they bring in added excitement (bmx) and massive crowds (golf, equestrian).

Heidemann scores a hit and she wins, but if Shin doesn't get hit then she wins. Heidemann gets very aggressive and tries to score a valid hit to win, since she has to. But, the clock, with one second left, is *not quick enough* in this scenario and one second essentially becomes TOO long. 

Shin's in tears. What drama.

_________________
Shiftybadger explains it well. 

&gt;It doesn't get reset to 1 second every time if 0 isn't reached, internally it keeps track of milliseconds. The problem was that on the penultimate action the timekeeper accidentally didn't start the timer until after the halt and it went to zero. Being unable to reset it to the .2 or .1 seconds that were actually left, they had to reset it to 1 for the final action. This gave Heidemann the time she needed to score.

Edit: Bullshit IMO, Shin just lost.

Edit2: General consensus amongst top fencers and coaches is that Shin won. This was announced by the commentators. Written appeal by Korea was submitted.

Edit3: Shin loses and refuses to leave. She receives a yellow card. 

Edit4: Shin loses the bronze match to Sun Yujie of China, putting up a valiant effort.

I do ask you all to read and follow the [rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/olympics/faq) posted in the sidebar.  

**MEMES** 

Sorry but we don't allow memes or image macro posts.  With the massive number of events in such a short amount of time our front page real estate is pretty valuable, and memes just don't cut it.  Last time this was announced someone created /r/lolympics in protest, so feel free to go there for all your memey needs.  

**EVENT DISCUSSION THREADS**

We've created a separate subreddit for event discussion threads, again it would clutter the front page too much.  However you can see them both in the same page by clicking ""Olympics + Olympic Events"" in the ""EVENT THREADS"" dropdown menu above.  We feel that's a good compromise to prevent the front page from becoming 2 dozen discussion threads and one gif of the independent athletes dancing, but making it possible if you want.

**FUNDRAISER**

We've also started a Special Olympics fundraiser with the help of the admins and I encourage you all to donate whatever you can.  They're definitely a worthy cause and could whatever help we give.  The link to that is both next to the ""EVENT THREADS"" and over in the sidebar.

**FLAIR**

Finally flair, you can add your country's flag (or another flag if you like them more) to your username by clicking [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/olympics/comments/t3nwy/flair_for_rolympics/).  I've had some requests for the IOC flag as flair to support the independent athletes or just the Olympics as a whole and promise to do it before the Olympics are over.  I'll probably get to it later tonight when the traffic influx has died down a little, I don't want to break it and have a bunch of new users miss out on their flair.

Merci beaucoup and thank you

PS if you could upvote this so more people could see it that's be swell, I don't get karma for self posts.

Sorry but we're not going to do that, people want to talk about sports results as they happen.  Stopping everyone who watched it or read the news about the results from posting about them is unfair to them.  It's the Olympics, there are dozens of results every day for two weeks.  It's not the Superbowl where you can hide from the TV or news for a day while you're waiting to watch it the next day, it would require a news black out from when you wake up until 8 at night for two weeks straight.

I asked a little while ago for people to try to keep spoilers to a minimum as a courtesy, but to make this a spoiler-free safe place when the rest of the internet is exploding with news wouldn't work.  

I understand that plenty of people disagree with this, so I encourage them to create a more niche subreddit for spoiler free Olympic news if they would like.  I'll gladly help with it any way I can.

We are all getting very excited for the Olympics which officially begin tomorrow. I want to quickly go over a few things before everything gets really crazy.

-----

##Subscribers and flair

We've just reached 5,000 subscribers! That's a great accomplishment considering that just a few months ago this subreddit only had several hundred subscribers. 

To see what kind of representation our subreddit has today I've taken a look at the flair settings. Right now we have a total of 825 people with flair from 69 different countries. There are lots of Americans, to be sure, but I'm glad to see a great deal of diversity here as well. Throughout the Olympics let's all keep in mind that this isn't a subreddit for Team USA. It's a place for people from all over the world to enjoy.

-----

##Special Olympics fundraiser 

We started our [Special Olympics fundraiser on Crowdtilt](https://reddit.crowdtilt.com/campaigns/rolympics-fundraiser-for-the-special-olympics) several weeks ago and have let it kind of simmer up until now. With the rush of people joining this subreddit I'd like to see a renewed excitement to support this great cause. We need at least $550 per day if we want to meet our goal of $10,000 by the end of the games.

Please consider donating even $10 if you are able to.

I'll get off the pulpit now and get back to more fun stuff.

-----

##Event threads

In order to keep /r/Olympics from becoming quickly overcrowded by event threads, all event threads for every event will be posted by moderators on /r/OlympicEvents. Oh, by the way, let me introduce you all to /r/OlympicEvents -- I'm not good at introductions.

The drop down menu on /r/Olympics (in the top left) will be kept updated with links to the most recent event threads however you can also just go straight to /r/OlympicEvents. /r/Olympics will remain the primary subreddit for Olympics news, announcements, and general discussion. 

If an event somehow is overlooked by us please send us a message [here](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Folympics).

-----

##Prediction competition

Many of you have already entered the prediction competition and submitted predictions for the preliminary football matches. For those who haven't gotten involved yet, it's never too late. Check the right sidebar each day for links to the prediction form. Here's a link to the most [recent form](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dEFNV3VyX1J1X0pOSjhoeXRiSmczb1E6MQ). 

Each day there will be a new one. This is a great way to keep track of all the events that are happening in the future so even if you are awful at these kind of things like I am you ought to give it a shot.

After religiously following the olympics in and out (thru the political bull-ish, controversy, bribery, heart warming stories, underdog victories, intense competiton and worldwide unity, among other things) I have really been motivated to try for the Olympics.

I would like to start in Team Handball.

I used to play when I was a teenager in the Dominican Republic, and watching the finals during the 30th Olympiad, got me hype again.

I really have never played a sport at all during my life (25 years old, 6'4'', about 200 pounds) but i'd like to really try this out in my city and hope that maybe in 4 years I could be in Rio.

Any other of you redditors feel inspired to make it to Rio 2016?

tl;dr - Inspired to try out for sport I used to play when I was younger. Anyone else inspired?",,False,self,t5_21of,False,,,True,t3_yhdcm,http://www.reddit.com/r/olympics/comments/yhdcm/olympic_inspiration/,

You guys did a great job of keeping this place clean of memes and other stupid shit. As well as providing a FANTASTIC side bar that kept up with events, and medal counts, etc. I also appreciate the attempt to make sister reddits for things such as live threads, even though it didn't work out as planned. 

**Long story short, THANK YOU /r/olympics MODS!! You guys did great.**

Smallest denomination is frames. This is recorded at 30 per second, so at 1:17 the time is more like ~1.5 seconds.

The clock had 1 second on it, and the judge ruled to add 1 second to the clock. Time starts when the man says engarde, time stops on a touch.

Touch happened at more than 1 second. This isn't just an ""error"" or an ""oopsy"", it's a clear, absolute throwaway. I'm SURE the judges have access to an accurate time to go with replays. Does anyone have any insight on why this poor woman is being stripped of her deserving place?

I've seen people try and excuse the judges because human error and blah blah, that's all fine and dandy for what happened PRIOR to the appeal, but once the appeal came in and they were looking at replays and whatnot, this isn't the kind of thing that should slip by.",,False,self,t5_21of,False,,,True,t3_xf4cs,http://www.reddit.com/r/olympics/comments/xf4cs/how_are_so_many_people_coming_off_as_okay_with/,

We've ballooned from 5K users the night before the Opening Ceremonies to 25K now, which is pretty awesome.  

**Olympic subreddits**

We're getting requests to add subreddits to our sidebar, it's a little packed right now so I've been resistent.  I'll plug them now.  

/r/TeamGB, to celebrate our colonial oppressors

/r/TeamUSA, to celebrate our freedom to overeat

/r/lolympics, created to fight the /r/Olympics oppressive anti-meme tyranny

/r/Olympians, for supporting Olympians

[Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/olympics/comments/xkym0/new_event_subredditsplease_read_mod_candidates/) is a thread pushing some subreddits created for the minor Olympic sports, also looking for mods

There is also a subreddit dedicated to Olympic porn or something, but I genuinely couldn't find the message telling me about it.  If you see this mod put it in the comments and I'll plug it here.

**Trolls**

Because of the increase in size we've had the obligatory trolls.  We've banned a few and removed a few other comments.  Thanks for reporting them and continue to do so, but please understand that someone saying something negative about a country isn't necessarily trolling.  Someone saying ""I don't think USA really deserved that win"" isn't trolling or a removable offense, it has to be pretty blatantly offensive (trust me, it'll be obvious).

**Special Olympics fundraiser**

We're slowly approaching our goal, and none of the money will be donated if we don't make it to that goal, so please donate whatever you can.

**NBC threads and Memes**

Our enforcement of the ""No NBC threads"" isn't as a 100% thing.  Well written news articles discussing the NBC situation are much different from the dozens of ""NBC sucks"" self posts the rule was created to fight.  Memes are still banned.

**Spoilers** 

People are complaining about spoilers.  We still maintain that spoilers are OK, but I'm going to ask again for people to try to use discretion to not ruin it for the people who couldn't watch it.  As an example, don't write a self post titled ""MICHAEL PHELPS WINS THE 100M FLY!!!""  Instead maybe write ""WHAT AN EXCITING 100M FLY!!""  

**Medal Count**

Out medal count in the sidebar is ranked Gold&gt;Silver&gt;Bronze.  Sorry if your country isn't ranked #1 because of that, but understand it really doesn't matter which country is the top of the list.  The medal count remains the same.  

**Messages**

I've been getting messages sent to my account that would better go to all the mods.  It's not a big deal at all, but you might get a faster response if you sent a message to all the mods instead of just me.  

**Fin**

That is all, carry on carrying on, and since it's the weekend I know our mods won't be as active.  So if a submission gets stuck in the spam filter for a little longer I'm sorry in advance.

I use a DNS VPN called [Unblock-US](www.unblock-us.com) (you can use your e-mail for a 1 week free trial and then you can pay 4.99 for a 1 month membership). There may be ways to circumvent their one week free trial but I am not familiar with them -- perhaps someone who figures out how to 'lengthen' the trial can help us out. As the name suggests it gives access to the USA so us Europeans can watch Netflix and Hulu but as a bonus this VPN also gives access to the UK namely BBC iPlayer. Using this service you can watch all of the Olympics live using a UK VPN. I have used the service for over a year, and have to say I am a happy customer. I am in no way affiliated with this VPN just trying to pass on some information which may help some of you. 

Here are a PSA posted about the Olympics but I can confirm that iPlayer works (I am currently abroad and able to enjoy BBC Olympics coverage, proving it works!)

[Olympic Update](http://support.unblock-us.com/customer/portal/articles/657274-oylmpic-update)

Just go to the [BBC Sport](www.bbc.co.uk/sport) website tomorrow and enjoy day 2 of the Olympics till close!!

I hope that helps some of you enjoy the Olympics this summer. As a happy Netflix user from Blighty, I thought I would return the favour to you yanks (and any other nationalities trying to watch Olympic coverage!) :) ",,False,self,t5_21of,False,,,True,t3_xbg66,http://www.reddit.com/r/olympics/comments/xbg66/screw_nbc_watch_the_olympics_every_event_live_and/,

No, it was something quite different. It was the athlete who, statisticly, did worse than anyone else in the Olympics. Her name was Sarah Attar and she finished the 800m almost a lap behind all the other competing athletes.
But as she finished, the loudest cheers were heard. No matter what country they came to support, the whole crowd were right there behind her. Cheering her on.

In my team I only used one athlete per sport to mix it up a bit, but that's not a stipulation of this post.


**USA:**


**1. Chris Paul, Point Guard, NBA:** Chris Paul is quick, has great hands, great vision and would be capable of making outstanding no-look pinpoint throws at the opposing team. What makes him such a great basketball player and sets him above other point guards in the league is his creativity and on team USA he'd be the wild card throwing no look behind the back shots(?) at the other team.


**2. Justin Verlander, Pitcher, MLB:** Verlander would be breaking opponents fingers left and right, no one could catch one of his 100+ mph throws. [It would probably go something like this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjxMS1GxmP4)


**3. Tim Howard, Goalkeeper, US Men's National Soccer:** Every dodgeball team needs a guy with sure hands that the other team will avoid throwing at. Tim Howard is arguably the best goalkeeper ever produced by the USA and even won GK of the year a few years ago in the English Premier League while playing for world renowned Manchester United. Tim also has Tourettes Syndrome and could probably psych out the other team with a few random ""SHIT FUCK CUNT"" shouts.


**4. Darren Sproles, RB/Punt Returner, NFL:** Sproles is really the total package when it comes to a dodgeball player, he's crazy athletic, has great hands, is tough as hell, has amazing agility, and he's got lightning speed. Sproles would be teleporting around the court and would be almost un-hittable by the opposing team, dude is just too fast and too shifty. Those who follow the NFL also know Sproles has a great set of hands and routinely catches balls out of the backfield, so being able to catch balls out of mid air would be one of his strongest dodgeball attributes.


**5. Floyd Mayweather, Boxing:** Mayweather's got two of the fastest hands in pro sports and is used to operating in tight spaces. Aside from that, his foot speed and reaction time would be on another level, if you can dodge a fist from point blank range, you can dodge a ball. As an undefeated boxing champion at multiple weight classes, Mayweather would be bring an unbeatable winning mentality and some much needed swagger to the group.


So that's my team, what say you, rest of world, do you think you've got 5 guys who can beat us?",,False,self,t5_21of,1375391820.0,,,True,t3_1jif54,http://www.reddit.com/r/olympics/comments/1jif54/hypothetical_dodgeball_has_just_become_an_olympic/,

There are plenty of world championships going on this month in the winter sports, all giving away valuable points for qualification for Sochi 2014. So far this month we have already seen the [FIL Luge World Championships](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIL_World_Luge_Championships_2013) which were dominated by Germany. In fact the they were so dominant German athletes finished first, second, third and fourth in the men's singles and first and second in all other events except for the team relay, which was also won by Germany, only because it was limited to only one entry for the event.

The following is a list of some of the major international competitions coming up in February. If you'd like to see a comprehensive list of upcoming events then take a look at Jetouellet's [calendar](http://www.reddit.com/r/olympics/comments/y8tob/olympic_sports_and_multi_event_calendar/) and [streaming and highlights links.](http://www.reddit.com/r/olympics/comments/yt9k1/where_to_watch_olympic_sports_both_recorded_and/)

It looks like a few people are acting as quality control; which is awesome for /new, but doesn't work that well on the older, popular links.  

Just so everyone understands fully, all the mods are pretty active and check the modqueue continually.  If you report something we'll usually get to it within an hour or two (often much sooner), if that post is still up hours after you reported it we've approved it.  If something has hundreds of upvotes then we've definitely seen and approved of it, so we're just going to approve or reapprove it on autopilot.  

I understand people have differing ideas of quality submissions, some want less quality control while others want more (I guess really people have different ideas of quality).  Sorry but there's no perfect solution.  

Regarding comments, there's a large gray area in negativity.  Obviously comments like ""Fuck off xxxxx scum!"" will be removed (unfortunately you can fill that blank in with multiple ethnicities and you'll get posts we've removed), but we aren't going to remove every slightly negative comment.  Leave the slightly negative and creepy posts there for when they brag about being a big thing on Reddit at a coffeeshop.  Also, stop creeping on the gymnasts, that's why we can't have nice things.

Some results from Dec 2012	
			
* USA dominated the [FINA Short Course Swimming Championships](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_FINA_World_Swimming_Championships_(25_m\)) with 11 gold medals. China, Hungary and Denmark came in second with three golds each. For the USA team Ryan Lochte backed up his performance from the London Games with 8 medals, 6 of them gold, at this meet.				
* Both Norway and Scotland failed to defend their men's and women's European Curling Championships respectively from last year as both teams lost in the final this time round. The men's competition was won by Sweden while Russia took out the women's competition.				
* Australia won the Hockey Champions Trophy for the fifth consecutive time which keeps Australia's impressive record of winning every major tournament (except for the London Olympics) since 2009.				
* There are no surprises with the countries represented at the top of the World Cup standings in the winter sports at around the halfway stage of the season. Austria leads the overall nation's standings in alpine skiing, while Aksel Lund Svindal (NOR) leads the individual standings in 3 of the 5 men's events and Tina Maze (SLO) and Lindsey Vonn (USA) share the lead in the 5 women's events. Norway currently leads the way in cross country skiing and the nordic combined. While in the luge there are at least 2 Germans in the top 3 standings for each event.

A few weeks ago I posted about my interest in participating in the Rio 2016 Olympics for Team Handball.

Well today in a few hours I will start.

I won't lie: I'm nervous as all fuck. I haven't played in over ten years. I don't work out or keep a healthy diet. I have weak knees and a few other joints.

But I am inspired.

Here's the original post from a few weeks ago for those that want some proof / background info of my new found 're inspiration' : 

http://www.reddit.com/r/olympics/comments/yhdcm/olympic_inspiration/

Tl;dr - I'm practicing for a sport that I truly love after such a long time being inactive in any physical sort.
--
EDIT (20:55 EST) - So I just came back from the practice and scrimmage and I MUST say, it was AMAZING. I loved the competition, the workout and the fast pace of the sport!

It was a thrill. I never have worked out so vigorously in my life and then to be able to keep stamina above several other players: bar none such a GOOD healthy high.

PLUS one of our main trainers and coaches is Ryan Homsy, from Team Canada. Check him out [here](http://vimeo.com/37502697)

I will say this: I SUCK at offense **...laughs to himself...**. BUT I'm pretty good at defending the wing positions. :)

I will do this every weekend I have available and hope to see if I can make it to Rio.

Thanks for paying attention Reddit.

Cool as cucumbers, you bunch.

The main thing you need to know is that the IOC rules are created and enforced solely to prevent companies from exploiting the Olympic brand without putting money into the Olympic pot, that's all.

The Olympic brand is worth a lot of money.  Companies pay millions of dollars in sponsorship fees to be able to use the Olympic brand in advertising.  Other large companies spend a lot of time and effort trying to get around spending millions for advertising rights.  Pepsi drove a truck alongside the torch route in '96, pretty much every large sponsor of Olympic athletes who haven't sponsored the games get together with their lawyers to create advertising that toes the legal line, clothing companies have given free kit to spectators to get their brands seen in the broadcasts, small advertisements are thrown up outside the venues, etc.  [Here](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-18628635) is an article about the different ambush marketing techniques used.

If the IOC doesn't protect its brand, then there's no reason for companies to spend the money to sponsor the events.  They could just use the trademark.  Same thing with cracking down on the ""Beer Olympics"" or whatnot, the way trademark law works is you either protect it or lose it.  It's the reason why Reddit requires people to get approval for jerseys or whatnot before allowing them permission to use the brand.

As for all the 1984-esque rules about the what people can and can't say about the Olympics you've read about in blog posts, **those don't apply to you**.  Sorry, I usually hate to bold things, but the misunderstanding is way too prevalent.  Those rules apply to athletes and other accredited persons, so not you.  There's probably some rules on tickets about restrictions on pictures but the IOC have said that they aren't going to crack down on Auntie Mable in Norwich.  [Here](http://blogs.wsj.com/tech-europe/2012/07/19/ioc-to-go-easy-on-fans-who-share-olympic-video/?mod=e2tw) is an article on that.  

As for commercialization, that's a whole other argument for a new day; but I'll gladly argue that the Olympics are the least commercialized major sporting event.  While you're (hopefully) enjoying the events, try to find advertising inside the venues other than the small clothing manufacturers' labels.  

Sorry for the serious tone, but this place seems to have focused on inaccurate negatives, and that irks me.

In December we see the Badminton and Table Tennis seasons culminating with their respective world tour finals. The top 20 table tennis singles players are playing for the $104,000 first prize while the top 8 pairs will be playing for the $50,000 first prize in the doubles events. While in badminton the top 8 singles players and top 8 doubles teams will be playing for a $40,000 first prize in each event.	
			
An important step in qualification for the curling competition at Sochi 2014 will take place this week with the hosting of the European Championships. The top 8 men's and top 7 women's teams from this tournament will qualify for the World Champions in March and failure to qualify for the World Championships will make qualification for Sochi somewhat more difficult and even impossible if the team has not competed at either of the 2011 or 2012 World Championships.

December also sees several world cup rounds in:

* [](/alpineskiing) alpine skiing
* [](/crosscountry) cross country skiing
* [](/snowboarding) snowboarding
* [](/skijumping) ski jumping
* [](/nordic)  nordic combined and
* [](/freestyleskiing) freestyle skiing. 

The results from these events will contribute to a points table which will be used to [determine majority of the field taking part in Sochi 2014](http://www.fis-ski.com/data/document/fis-qualification-system-sochi-2014.pdf). [You can see the full calander here](http://www.fis-ski.com/uk/disciplines/fiscalendar.html?place_search=&amp;seasoncode_search=2013&amp;sector_search=&amp;date_search=&amp;gender_search=&amp;category_search=WC&amp;codex_search=&amp;nation_search=&amp;disciplinecode_search=&amp;limit=20&amp;date_from=12). There are also a number of World Cup events taking place in Sochi at venues which will be used for the Olympics.

Some results from Nov 2012	
			
* Australian up and coming star Kenneth To and Hungarian Katinka Hosszu took out the $100,000 first prize in the men's and women's swimming World Cup series respectively. Hosszu, who won 4 events at the European Championships earlier in the year and is a former World Champion, dominated the competition by winning 53 medals, 39 of them gold, in the 8 meets. Her nearest rival, Britta Steffen, managed 17 medals, with 12 gold.				
* The New Zealand juggernaut in rugby sevens was dealt a blow as they were defeated by Samoa in the final of the World Series event in Dubai. New Zealand still lead the series while there is a three way tie for second place with Fiji, Samoa and surprise packets Kenya. Both Fiji and Samoa are looking good to claim their first ever Olympic medal come 2016.			
* In tennis Djokovic ends the year as the top player as he defeated Federer in final of the World Tour Finals and the Czech Republic ends the year as the top team after defeating Spain in the Davis Cup final.",,False,self,t5_21of,1357040873.0,,au,True,t3_14gvwg,http://www.reddit.com/r/olympics/comments/14gvwg/olympic_sports_in_dec_2012/,

Long time lurker, first time poster. X-posted from r/sports. I thought this is a cause r/running could get behind.
We're T-minus 8 days until the London Olympic Games and there's one athlete missing an invitation. South Sudanese runner Guor Marial qualified last month for the Olympic marathon after finishing a race at a great time of 2 hours, 12 minutes, and 55 seconds. Marial is also a refugee from Unity State, in what is now the brand new state of South Sudan - and therein lies the problem. Because South Sudan has no National Olympic Committee, and because Marial has chosen not to run for (North) Sudan (whose security forces killed 28 members of his family), he has been left without a national Olympic sponsor.
There is a another solution. Marial can be given status to run as an independent, much like East Timorese athletes did in the 2000 Sydney Olympics. So far, attempts to lobby the IOC by the Government of South Sudan and organisations like Refugee International to give Marial independent status have been unsuccessful, so I think it’s time to raise the power of the internet and help one man fulfil his dream and get him on the Olympic marathon starting line.

Please take the time to sign the petition below and share wherever you can - http://www.change.org/petitions/president-of-the-international-olympic-committee-allow-south-sudanese-runner-guor-marial-to-compete-in-the-olympic-marathon#

You can also lobby the IOC on Twitter (https://twitter.com/olympics) and Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/olympics). A shortened petition link is here - http://chn.ge/Pn8oVB. Please retweet, send to news organisations, friends, family and anyone else who can boost the signal.

I believe the ultimate decision lies with IOC President Count Jacques Rogge.The more noise we can make about this, the better, but be polite and respectful with it.

My girlfriend and I were only part way through the guided tour when this guy called Pete (clocked his name badge, later found out he was heading up security at the exhibition) started shouting at everyone and getting really aggressive; forced us to abandon the tour and leave the venue without an explanation.  Such an unnecessary reaction - those that asked what the problem was got more verbal abuse, though I didn't witness anything physical.

I'd have expected such a reaction if we were causing trouble in the venue, but even if there were an emergency, that's no way to handle a crowd.  I feel sorry for the organisers of the event, but they obviously made a mistake in hiring that company / guy to handle security.  Why let us in if there was this VIP private event already booked?  Why not just apologise and explain the situation rather than letting hot-headed security oafs shout and scream at us to get out?  If the same people are involved in organising the Winter Olympics itself, I dread to think how that will pan out...

One of the more sympathetic security guys outside the venue told me this Pete had a reputation for being overly aggressive when it wasn't called for - I got the e-mail address of the guy that runs the security company and sent a complaint, but hey, what can you do except bitch on the internet about this stuff...

Obviously I don't blame Jacques Rogge for what happened, but the people running Sochi.Park obviously don't have a clue about public relations - when I spoke to someone at the venue about the appalling treatment we received at an event that is meant to attract visitors to their Winter Olympics in Russia, they said, ""The VIP visit is nothing to do with me - it's not Russian visitors, it's English ones - you should be pissed off with them...the security is nothing to do with me.""

As a way to mark it we'll have a logo contest to replace the current London based one with a Sochi based one.  

If you're wondering what logo I'm talking about it's the one at your top left, [here](http://imgur.com/dIVdRry) it is by itself.  

**Rules:**  

* Please base it on Sochi 2014's logo, seen [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:2014_Winter_Olympics_logo.svg)

* Vote for your favorite, we'll only be looking at upvotes so downvotes don't count

So am I at fault for not turning off the TV when everyone on NBC starts talking about the swimming race that will happen in an hour and a half before they are airing it? I mean, they could at least have said ""spoilers"" or something. Now I know the outcome of what was supposed to be the highlight event for us Americans on Saturday night.

The results from these events will contribute to a points table which will be used to [determine majority of the field taking part in Sochi 2014](http://www.fis-ski.com/data/document/fis-qualification-system-sochi-2014.pdf). You can see the [full calendar here](http://www.fis-ski.com/uk/disciplines/fiscalendar.html?place_search=&amp;seasoncode_search=2013&amp;sector_search=&amp;date_search=&amp;gender_search=&amp;category_search=WC&amp;codex_search=&amp;nation_search=&amp;disciplinecode_search=&amp;limit=20&amp;date_from=11).

I think, by far, the biggest event on the list for this month is the ATP World Tour Finals offering more than $1,000,000 to the winner.

Some results from Oct 2012

* 2004 Olympics marathon bronze medallist Zersenay Tadese of Eritrea won his record 5th IAAF World Half Marathon World Championship. His results in the last 6 world championships include 5 wins and one 2nd place finish!
* 2008 and 2012 Olympics men's badminton singles silver medallist and current world number 1 Lee Chong Wei of Malaysia won the Denmark Open. He also currently leads the BWF Super Series standings. The women's tournament was won by 2012 Olympics bronze medallist Saina Nehwal of India after defeating the series leader Juliane Schenk of Germany.
