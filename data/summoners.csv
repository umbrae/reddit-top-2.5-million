1362236097.0,136,self.summoners,19iusb,Furor boots turn snowballs into avalanches. ,155,19,40,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/19iusb/furor_boots_turn_snowballs_into_avalanches/,"So I really like the concept of this subreddit, and my only fear is that it will be over run by non-discussion topics and self-promotion. To combat that, I wanted to start a discussion about a hidden OP trend that is starting to come into play on both the Garena TW server, and NA (both around platinum elo).

Furor boots on AD carries who are winning the lane. 

The big weakness you can have bot lane is when you just cannot fight a 2v2. It's a brutal feeling of simply being out-damaged, out-traded, etc. When you're trying to last hit under turret and the enemy is just attacking you / poking you outside of turret range. Recently I've been seeing a lot of aggressive AD carries get an early kill or two and immediately rush Furor boots. Their typical build will be something like a Long Sword w/ 2 pots -&gt; Bezerker's Greaves -&gt; Furor enchant. 

The short story is that you spend 650G on top of your boots for an additional 12% MS speed boost. 

In rune terms, that 12% would be a massive **2.6 times** the amount of movement speed granted by three movement speed quintessences (4.5% total). For a stat that's incredibly hard to itemize, that's huge value. 

The concept is, especially on autoattackers like Caitlyn or Kog with huge range, you can use your autoattacks as gap closers -- autoattack a minion and you get more than **two phantom dancer's** worth of movement speed. Autoattack them, chase them, dodge skill shots -- movement speed is one of the most brutal statistics in a perfectly played game because it allows you to do so much: Caitlyn's who stay at 650 range without relying on their E to gap close, Vayne's who pop ult and run at nearly 500 MS, etc. 

So -- what do you guys think? Obviously the big disadvantage is you need tier two boots *and then an additional 650G*. The 550G upgrade cost from tier ones to Greaves, then an additional 650G on top, is 1200G that puts you two waves of farm away from a BF sword.

The real increase of effective damage comes through the number of additional autoattacks you put down on the enemy. If you're not buying these boots to stay in their face the whole way through lane stage, don't bother. If you sink 1200G on mobility and AS and they put 1200G into two Dorans and a Red Pot, and sit there in a slug fest, they will likely lose. 

But if you get a lead to the point where they cannot 2v2, and you can continually all-in? Furor boots will ruin their world. 

But enough from me. Let's here what the pro's have to say!

[1:43:17 AM] m1lk: hey dude just wanted to mention, i played with bebe on garena today and went dorans -&gt; bezerker's + furor boots rush in lane and DUNKED the enemy  
[1:44:12 AM] m1lk: i went back and watched the replay because i didnt know if it was just circumstance (ie, shit enemy) or what, but he was able to stay at pretty much exactly 650 range from ez at all times and he just never stopped attacking  
[6:18:54 AM] Doublelift: furor boots  
[6:19:03 AM] Doublelift: ok on cait  
[6:19:04 AM] Doublelift: best on kog  
[6:19:18 AM] Doublelift: 650g is a lot to sink into pure mobility though  
[6:19:29 AM] Doublelift: mobility is the key to good positioning but nobody will zerg Cait anyways  
[6:19:44 AM] Doublelift: but ya **keeping a full range tether on the opponent is the highest level of outplay**

1364879223.0,131,self.summoners,1bhx3s,Some Objective Stats for All-Star Voting,154,23,112,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1bhx3s/some_objective_stats_for_allstar_voting/,"I think most of the people following LoL pro scene would agree that stats like K/D/A and Gold Per Minute aren't absolutely everything. There are obviously a lot of other factors when you evaluate a particular League of Legends professional player. To name just a few there is leadership, mental toughness, versatility, ability to adapt, desire to win at all costs and many other intangibles. 

-----

However not all of those could be accurately measured, in the meantime the dry statistics give us an objective representation of the consistency of various players. So without further adieu, here are some statistics in an easily digestible form.

-----
---

**You can vote with your heart, but don't disregard logic either!**

---
--- 

**KDA** - Average Kill Death Assist Ratio = (Kills+Assists)/Deaths

**GPM** - Gold Per Minute (rate at which gold is earned)

**Avg Gold** - how much gold a player finishes the game with

**Versatility** - number of different champions a player *had managed to win with* 

**Normalised KDA** - a player's KDA vs Team's Average KDA ratio

**KDA spread** - highest to lowest KDA swings from week to week to display consistency

These streamers are now influencing an opinion that: BotRK is broken. I love OddOne but I suspect 'BotRK is OP' will be his stump speech anytime he's losing and there's one on the other team. People will be **convinced** without even trying it.

My reaction is to combat this, because it's the first truly viable item that would allow for a major shake up in otherwise stagnant ADC build paths. It's also not that crazy on ADCs, but highly abusive on bruisers.

3 days before it was released we predicted exactly who would pick up, and abuse, new BotRK. One user said that since it's obvious bruisers won't get a nerf in S3, we should expect a nerf. With all the knee jerk reaction in the forums from people unwilling to deviate from 'build warmogs every game', it's seeming more likely.

I wish Riot would consider making it a ranged only item before nerfing it, as it isn't overpowered on them. If they hit the attack speed too hard, or the already low AD, it will likely become niche on ADCs. While still being a brand new toy for bruisers (who don't even need it).

So yeah. 

**TL;DR:** Any ideas on how to change it without nerfing it out of viability for ADCs?

-------
I've been playing Quinn a lot on PBE. If you go glass cannon, her end-game is hilarious. She easily becomes an assassin with her Ult in non-direct engages. But that's not what I want to talk about, as that's probably how she'll be played most of the time after release.

Build I've tried: IE -&gt; BoTRK -&gt; Randuins -&gt; Warmogs

The new BoTRK gives attack speed. An interesting fact about this build: It can beat another Quinn going a standard build in a 1v1 duel due to BoTRK/Randuins passive/active. It gives her a very utility feel, but she retains a lot of her power. 

This is because BoTRK can outpace IE/BT if the target is at +50% hp and only falls off at lower HP. Which becomes less of a problem the later a game goes. New BoTRK gives just 10% less attack speed than PD and more lifesteal than BT. It is 950/350 cheaper than IE/BT respectively.

What I find *most* interesting about this build is that, even in a game where you're behind, your early to mid-game (which happens to be the strongest period for Quinn) **still looks the same as a normal ADC's**. The build up is the same, but the pay-off is better:

* She can start longsword, as her base movement is 335 (above average). This can transition into a Vampiric Scepter, a core item to Bilgewater Cutlass, which builds into BoTRK.
* In addition to the active, Bilgewater Cutlass gives 25 AD and 12% lifesteal (as much as a completed BT) for 1800 less. It's like a baby BT and it doesn't feel bad to sit on until BoTRK.
* By mid-game you'll have IE, BoTRK. You'll have 15% lifesteal (more than BT), 40% attack speed (comparable to PD), and more bonus AD than an IE -&gt; PD rush. BotRK's passive 5% current health on hit effect allows you to better deal with high HP targets, and frees you up to build defensively from here.

Randuins builds out of Warden's Mail, probably the most gold efficient armor item in the game. And a Giant's belt, which is an item ADCs are already picking up. The final stats are +500 hp and +70 armor, great.

But the passive and active are where it shines:

&gt;Passive 	Unique Passive – Cold Steel: If you are hit by a basic attack, you slow the attacker's attack speed by 20% and their movement speed by 10% for 1.5 seconds.

&gt;Active 	Unique Active: Slows the movement speed of nearby enemy units by 35% for 2 (+ 0.5% total armor) (+ 0.5% total magic resistance) seconds. 60 second cooldown (500 Range).
 

You get -20% attack speed, and -10% movespeed **guaranteed**.

For those keeping score, assuming they've gone an ordinary BT/IE -&gt; PD (+Whatever item), they now have less attack speed and movement speed than you during a fight (despite going PD, which gives both). Even less if you're in ult-form with +40-80% attack speed, and +20% movespeed in combat.

So even though they've gone standard IE/BT -&gt; PD -&gt; (Whatever), you should be able to duel them and win. But now you have BoTRK's passive for high HP targets too, and the survivability to get dived or dive yourself.

Warmogs is subject to change, and can be swapped for MR if need be. However, more HP has more all around use, as seen by the current meta. It could even be an offensive item if you're doing well (I suggest PD, as it has been mathed out to be more effective than extra AD in terms of time to kill).

So IE -&gt; BoTRK -&gt; Randuins, theoretically beats your counterpart ADC going standard, and affords you the ability to dive, and affords you the ability to get dived and kite/survive (one of the main ADC problems in S3). **Most of all I think it will help Quinn players better utilize her ultimate**, and the unique opportunity to go melee as an ADC.

I'm not saying to go this every game, obviously it's better when you see HP stacking ahoy. But I think BoTRK may be key in solving the problem of, how do I do damage but still survive. It softens the slope from mid to late-game and opens up a more defensive path. It lessens the reliance on that 6 item hyper-carry requirement just be relevant once everyone stacks their HP. Its active, which I haven't mentioned much, deals 15% of targets max HP in physical damage, heals you for that amount, and *steals* 30% of their movespeed. This has all sorts of good use, but I didn't feel the need to include it above, as the stats/passive are enough and more consistent. 

Anyways, it's a really long post but I hope this sort of post is more welcome here.

#**Early Game**

**Incredible sustain in jungle**

* Noticed at a certain HP, I seemed to never drop lower in life when farming jungle
* Could take out Golems the 2nd time they spawned starting with only 100 hp.  Red/Blue could be taken with 2-300 HP very early
* Test - farm as long as possible.  I quit once I got to level 15, never having backed, still holding just a machete.  Not practical, just to give you the idea he ain't skeered of no creeps
* Once you have high enough HP and/or Spirit Visage, easy to regain lost hp
* How?
* abilities cost % current HP.  Passive gives back % max HP.  So as his life gets lower, he gains more back from using abilities.  So the cost of using abilities is sometimes *gaining* life (so long as you pick up the blobs)


**Jungle Speed**

* Approx 4:15 clear w/o assistance at wolves/blue, but I'm no Stonewall
* Max W first - AoE, % max hp damage, low cd so it’s very spammable

**Ganks**

Pre-6 ganks are ok

* Gap closer knockup and slow potentially for level 2 - 3 ganks
* Damage isn’t huge
* Best he’s paired with a high damage top/mid to secure kills.

Post-6 ganks are pretty good

* E, knockup, slow, Ult locks down enemy for quite a while and the ult will also displace them
* There isn’t much range on his Q or W, and his Ult takes a second to get going, so it’s easy to escape once the enemy gets a certain distance away (like Flash)

**Invading / vs Invades**

* Not an early duelist like Lee Sin
* Should be fairly resistant to invades.  Does not rely on blue buff at all for jungle clears/ganks.  He uses HP, not mana. He only benefits from the CDR, but W already has a fairly low cd for clearing the jungle
* Has the option to start Red or Blue, Red likely the best default

**Late Game**

* Falls off in damage, takes much more of an initiator/support tank role

*****

#**How To Build**

* Manaless AP champ with low AP ratios limits number of effective &amp; efficient items he can use
* He's going to be mostly pigeon-holed into one or two builds

**Health**

* Abilities use health (not mana, energy, etc.) which would lead you to believe that more health = more ability casts.  
* However, his abilities use a percentage of current health so more health means they cost more.
* Passive (% max health heal) helps offset this cost but makes you dependent on gathering globs
* Building some HP seems good for him as both a tank and gives him a greater heal from his passive

**Spell Vamp**

* All of Zac’s abilities are AoE which doesn’t pair well with Spell Vamp (heal amount reduced to 33%).

**Ability Power**

* All of his abilities scale off of ability power but the ratios are not very good at all: .5 / .02 / .7 / .25 (QWER)

**Magic Penetration** 

* One of the better stats for Zac but only by default

**Cooldown Reduction**

* Already has low cooldowns (7 / 4 / 12 / 100 at max ranks)
* Making them even lower is one of the best and most efficient ways to increase damage 
* Q, Stretching Strike - 4.2 seconds
* W, Unstable Matter - 2.4 seconds
* E, Elastic Slingshot - 7.2 seconds
* R, Let’s Bounce - 60 seconds
* However, it is hard to itemize CDR on Zac without buying a useless stat or forgoing a useful one
* Nashor’s (AS), Morellonomicon/Athene’s (Mana Regen) - he doesn't want these extra stats
* Going CDR boots means you can’t use a different set of boots such as Sorc or Merc treads
* Spirit Visage and Locket of the Iron Solari work
* CDR from masteries, runes, and Brilliance Potion


**Two potential builds:**

1)  **CDR Utility Tank**

* more damage, faster wave pushing/jungle clearing, faster regen when low on life
* W is very spammable and does % based damage in AoE, so there’s a big part of your damage and sustain
* Can get 30% CDR using tanky items like Spirit Visage and Locket.  Pick most of the rest up from masteries, maybe even newly buffed CDR Runes, or just don't max and go with other tanky items like Randuins/Sunfire
* Spirit Visage has a lot of synergy with his kit
* All these items also provide some HP which grants him more life back from using abilities
* Stacking HP doesn’t make him quite as tanky as normal since you will be spamming his abilities in team fights/skirmishes and have little time to retrieve the blobs so you want to build some Armor/MR
* Spirit Visage, Locket, Aegis, Randuin’s, etc 
* 10% of his hp and 50% Ar/MR are shared by his passive ([the Terminator 2 T-1000's passive :P](http://youtu.be/e5gGV1WB-xg?t=3m1s)), so it gives him better chances to revive as well
* Sunfire Cape is another decent item on him that gives him some Armor, HP, and a bit more damage, and also works well with MPen


2) **MPen build**

* since his AP ratios are low, this is a way to go for a higher damage build
* allows his W to do higher damage in the same way MPen Mundo does more cleaver damage
* Item’s like Abyssal, Rylai’s, Liandry’s can allow him to be a little tanky, provide some utility, and have high MPen so he does a bit more damage

Overall, CDR Utility tank or some MPen mix is the way to go.

*****

#**Final Thoughts**

**Sejuani syndrome** - Pretty good at a lot of things, but rarely the best.  May simply be overshadowed by junglers who can do similar things, but better.

*  Doesn’t have the late game damage of a Hecarim, Nasus, or even Amumu
*  Doesn’t quite have the level 2-3 ganks of a Maokai
*  Doesn’t have the invade ability of a Lee Sin, Olaf, Shaco
*  Doesn’t have the counterjungling ability of a Mundo, Shyvana
*  Cannot dive and kill the carry as well as a Xin Zhao, Vi, Volibear
*  Doesn’t have the cc quality or drag/baron/buff control of a Cho
*  Nasus and Amumu are also strong tanks with % max hp magic damage so he’s not unique in that
*  Ult isn’t quite as good at initiating team fights as an Amumu, Hecarim, Jarvan
*  Support/low damage jungle tanks are not too popular right now
*  Numbers still being tweaked and buffed so we’ll have to wait and see how he ends up to say how viable he will be.  While he's not the best at any one thing, he's pretty good at a few of them.

**He’s Fun**

* Morello called him a ""throwback to the first 40 champions""
likely meaning the more playful, silly nature of the champion.  
* He’s not a ""super-cereal"" Darius, Rengar, Renekton, etc.
* Blob catching mini-game
* Very cool and flavorful champion
* I feel like I'm playing a character from a [Pixar movie](http://youtu.be/xcDD22R6Lck?t=1m11s)

**Has a lot of potential if the numbers are right**

* Good CC
* Early gank options
* Team fight initiating ult
* Manaless - can freely give blue buff to mid at little cost

*****

#**TLDR**

**May not be top tier competitive at the moment.  We'll have to wait and see how his numbers turn out before hitting live.  He has pretty good gank potential early on, decent team fight initiation, just may be a jack of all trades, but master of none.**

###I. Introduction

""Inexperience"" is a common word used to explain why a team loses an early lead. However, what does it actually mean to say a team lost because ""they are inexperienced""? 

Obviously, it is not inexperience that *causes* teams to lose. Rather, inexperience correlates inversely with a deeper understanding of the game, so inexperienced teams typically lack a full understanding of certain concepts that are important for victory. It is rare that people look deeper, into those underlying concepts, which causes the ""inexperienced"" label to exist as a nebulous idea, used primarily as a convenient buzz word and lacking any useful analytical meaning. However, inexperience can be a useful concept and, semantics aside, it is not necessarily wrong to say a team lost due to inexperience: 

In the W9D1 game of the NA LCS, COL vs CRS, COL got out to a strong early lead, but could not close out the game. Their poor understanding of more sophisticated concepts led to numerous mistakes and missed opportunities, typical of inexperienced teams. In this analysis, we will study the portion of the game in which COL began to falter, from [20:40] to [38:35], and examine the mistakes ""caused"" by their inexperience.

We begin in section II by discussing the main concept that COL failed to capitalize on, creep wave manipulation, which is our main focus for this analysis. Section III presents the actual in-depth gameplay analysis in a series of images. Sections IV-VII will categorize COL's mistakes into 4 key areas of the game and discuss the concepts they failed to understand in each area.

**Team Comps**

**COL:** **Jayce** (Nickwu), **Alistar** (Lautemortis), **Janna** (pr0lly), **Varus** (brunch U), **Kayle** (M eye A)

**CRS:** **Kha'zix** (Voyboy), **Volibear** (Saintvicious), **Morgana** (Nyjacky), **Twitch** (Cop), **Thresh** (Elementz)

For pushing, which is our main area of focus, COL clearly has better wave clear, with Jayce, Janna, and Varus, but CRS is not weak either, with Kha'zix and Morgana. Furthermore, CRS have Thresh hook plus the threat of Volibear's initiation, which act as an excellent deterrent against tower pushes.

###II. Key Focus: Creep Wave Manipulation

Creep waves have a subtle but extremely impactful effect on the game. A single minion is weak, but as minions build up and begin to snowball, they force pressure onto the lanes. Creep wave manipulation revolves around controlling the snowball of creep waves and using it to create advantages. Players can manipulate creep wave snowballs to pressure a single point in lane (freezing) or to pressure the enemy turrets (shoving) in order to accomplish a number of goals, such as denying the enemy of gold and experience or gaining map control. For our purposes, we will look at a how teams can use creep wave manipulation to execute the slow push strategy (credits for the terminology go to /u/bummer2000).

**The Problem**

Even when a team is winning, they do not always have the advantage. There are certain situational advantages that the enemy can have, nullifying the ""overall"" advantage of the winning team. Applied to pushing, the defending team always has the terrain advantage; the turret, the distance to the fountain, and a number of other factors create advantages for the defending team, so while a team may be winning, they cannot always purely push. In order to regain the situational advantage, the team can attempt a slow push.

**The Slow Push**

The slow push is a strategy that uses snowballing creep waves to apply pressure to all 3 lanes, forcing the defending team to defend on multiple fronts while the pushing team can focus on 1 lane. 

To execute the slow push, a team must first choose a lane to start a snowball. This lane is should be one that allows them to properly manipulate the snowball and thus, it will ideally be pushing toward the team and as far in as possible, so the enemy cannot interfere. Teams should choose an outer lane, allowing more waves to add to the snowball. 

Next, the team manipulates the wave to begin very slightly pushing toward the enemy base, allowing minions to stack up as the wave slowly moves forward. With strong map control, a team can control the rate of the snowball, giving a team as much or little time as it needs to prepare for the next step. 

Finally, the team applies pressure to the other lanes, either by split pushing or focusing on the non-snowballing outer lane. This is crucial to allow the snowballing lane to push uninterrupted. Because time is against the enemy, the team can play passively, taking no risks while the snowballing lane is pushing in. Once the snowballing lane has reached the enemy turrets, strong pressure from every lane creates a huge advantage for the pushing team.

Clearly, this strategy requires some degree of map control advantage, to prevent the enemy from stopping the snowballing lane prematurely. Thus it is best used in situations where the team has just enough of an advantage to have strong map control, but not enough to siege a tower in a direct push, which is precisely the situation that COL was in.

For an alternate explanation of the slow push, you can read [bummer2000's article](http://leagueanalysis.blogspot.tw/2013/03/lanning-set-ups-we-in-season-3.html).

###III. In-Depth Analysis

The images in the link below are the crux of this analysis and the reason why I am willing to title the post ""In-Depth"". The next 4 sections are primarily to summarize and to structure the analysis from the chronological format in the images into a categorical format.

All times that I refer to in the next sections are from the image timeline. I have also separated the images into different events (though they are not really separate events outside the context of this analysis) and labeled the events according to the category they belong to.

###**[[Images] In-Depth Analysis](http://imgur.com/a/iBYud#0)**
___

###IV. Pushing

**Relevant Events:** 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13

COL failed in pushing on several levels. Not only did COL fail to recognize opportunities to initiate a slow push (Events 1 2 3 5), they failed to capitalize when a slow push was already naturally in effect (Events 9 13). Furthermore, their most coordinated pushes were attempted precisely when the creep waves were pushing against them (Events 3 10). This does the exact opposite of the slow push, turning time against COL and allowing CRS to simply focus on one lane. Lastly, they failed to use creep wave pressure to push when CRS was out of position (Event 12).

Instead, they spent the time they should have used to push to take lesser advantages. One of the primary focuses for COL was the jungle objectives. At [21:53][22:31][25:02][30:26][31:05][36:43], COL missed opportunities to slow push and tried to obtain lesser objective advantages instead. Taking dragons [30:26][36:43] was a much worse alternative to slow pushing with the kind of map control COL had, but checking a red buff they weren't sure was there [22:31] or clearing out a single baron ward [21:53] were even worse. On the other hand, when taking the objectives, COL moved to them quickly and timed them well.

These are traits very illustrative of teams with the ""inexperienced"" label in the LCS. Slow pushing and other creep wave manipulation tactics require much more foresight and inference than timing and taking objectives. With less experience, teams like COL do not fully understand the map pressure that creep waves give, and thus rarely capitalize off these opportunities, but they see objective opportunities clearly and focus on them.

On the other hand, CRS, even though they were under heavy map pressure for the majority of the game, recognized when creep wave pressure gave them the advantage (Events 4 11). Twice, COL pushed mid while the outer lanes were pushing against them. When they were forced back to defend, CRS recognized they had a window of map control, and immediately pushed forward. Even when CRS failed to recognize creep wave pressure and left themselves open [30:46][34:24], they at least recognized the pressure eventually, unlike COL. Though they still would have been at a disadvantage if COL capitalized, their somewhat quick reaction would have allowed them to mitigate some of it.

###V. Tower Sieging

**Relevant Events:** 10, 14

(Tower sieging is technically part of pushing, but it is more convenient to talk about it separately.)

The 2 times COL made their most concerted pushes into towers, they failed to clear the CRS creep waves, despite having excellent wave clear. Unless a team is ahead enough to tank turrets, which COL wasn't, they use their own minion waves to tank turret shots in order to damage the turret. These turret shots are essentially a unit of time; the number of turret shots the minion wave tanks is the window of time a team can attack a tower.

In mid lane, the creep waves naturally meet in front of the towers when pushing, putting the melee minions in range of tower, but not the caster minions. This means that the ranged minions do not tank tower shots, and thus, the time window to siege is smaller. More minions also provide better blocking against skill shots, crucial for champions like Morgana and Thresh.

However, COL failed to understand this, and focused on poking CRS. This was especially foolish for Janna, since her tornado was unlikely to hit when CRS had so much room to run around behind the tower. Again, this is another trait typical of inexperienced teams. The effect of strong poke is much more memorable and obvious, while the advantage from clearing the creep wave is more subtle. Thus, COL chose to poke, failing to fully understand the impact of creep waves. This lack of understanding ultimately caused them to become impatient, attempting to tank a turret and leaving them vulnerable [38:17]. CRS capitalized on this and gained the advantage off the ensuing teamfight.
___
___
###VI. Objective Control

**Relevant Events:** 7

Thanks to their strong map control, COL took most objectives with ease. But the one time they were forced to fight over an objective, COL showed their inexperience. When attacking an objective like baron with an advantage, there are 2 basic actions a team can take: they can turn to fight or they can continue taking the objective.

However, the actual set of possible actions is far more diverse, as teams can mix the two basic actions together. Teams can send 1 champion to zone while the others continue attacking baron or have most players turn while one champion hits baron or any number of other combinations. 

In COL's situation, they only needed to reposition themselves in a way such that they could not be easily engaged upon. This meant keeping Alistar in front of the team with respect to CRS and ensuring the team was not too deep within the baron pit, to avoid being trapped by a Morgana flash ult. This would allow them to continue baron pressure but still turn easily, forcing a full commitment from CRS in which COL would have the advantage, or netting a baron, if not both. At [28:08], it looked as if they were transitioning to do exactly that. 

But in reality, they had committed fully to fight. CRS was not grouped up, nor particularly close, so they could not catch anyone easily. They were able to catch Thresh, but only at the cost of Varus ult, depriving them of their only long range CC. With only a support down, CRS still had threat and could now poke COL freely and stall for Volibear. This stopped any chance COL had to do baron or take a real advantage off kills.

Taking these more basic actions is again very common for inexperienced teams. Inexperienced teams lack the situational knowledge of what to do, as well as the coordination to know they will execute their strategy properly, so for them, the more basic actions are less risky. But of course, they are also less versatile, causing missed opportunities, as they did with COL.
___
___
###VII. Teamfighting

**Relevant Events:** 6, 8

There are numerous things to talk about with teamfighting, but we will focus on just 1, map terrain. In both teamfights choke points created situational advantages and disadvantages for both teams based on their positioning. Moving through a choke point forces a team to group up more than they otherwise would, leaving them more susceptible to AOE, forcing them to lose their tank line, or any number of other problems associated with poor positioning. Thus, choke points are terrain features teams should look to force their enemies into and avoid themselves.

In the first teamfight, Janna tried to initiate into an extremely disadvantageous area between 2 choke points. Disregarding the other huge factors, this was a poor decision in itself. Meanwhile, CRS strayed very little past the wraith brush because they were wary of the choke point. They required a strong advantage to overcome the choke, and since many of their spells had been used, they did not have it, despite the fact that COL was so low. Only when Janna poorly positioned into the area did CRS gain enough advantage to move forward.

In the second teamfight, the choke point limited the angle at which COL could attack Morgana. It was further limited by the zone that Volibear's threat created, so COL was forced into poor position if they were to follow up on Alistar. 

Failing to consider map terrain is common among even experienced teams, but it is more common for those with less experience.

###VIII. Final Thoughts

After CRS regained the advantage, they closed out the game with relative ease, though the advantage was not too large. With these concepts in mind, I encourage you to watch the rest of the game and examine how CRS pressured and pushed the map differently, and the resulting effects. It is also a worthwhile exercise to watch the COL games from W10D1 and look at where some of these mistakes popped up, even when they won.",,False,,t5_2wenn,1366386055.0,,,True,t3_1cm73q,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1cm73q/indepth_analysis_the_inexperience_factor_the/,

1362778814.0,75,self.summoners,19xoza,Running 14/0/16 on ADCs,93,18,50,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/19xoza/running_14016_on_adcs/,"I'm always experiementing with fun builds and rune pages for the champs I play and once in awhile I'll come across something I think is actually really really good.

14/0/16 is something I've began running on ALL my adcs once I played a few games with it since it felt incredibly strong. It was suggested that I post my ideas here in order to get some discussion going and maybe find a way to improve it even more.


-----

**So, why 14/0/16?**

After a LOT of experimentation with various openings (flask+pots, boots+pots, long sword+pots, dorans..), I came to LOVE the doran’s blade opening. I felt the extra health gave you so much of an advantage if you ever decided to fight bottom lane. I also felt the sustain on autos was actually very good, and would basically guarantee you win the lane if you ever got an advantage over someone that didn’t run a blade start.

However, I felt that running with a blade start was very very volatile. If you ever messed up a trade, you would now be 200 hp and be in killable range with no way to heal back up since you’re being zoned from your creeps. It was for this reason that I didn’t run blade start much.

However, I remember back months and months ago where doran’s blade + pots was an extremely strong start that EVERYONE ran and was eventually nerfed… and I realized I could still do that. Running 16 in utility gives you:

* 50 gold
* A Biscuit (regenerates 80hp/50mana)
* 2gp10

The 2gp10 is nice but negligible. The real reason for this mastery page lies in being able to get a biscuit AND an extra pot at the start at the game. Now you can effectively start doran’s blade + hp pot + biscuit.

**Why is this start so good?**

The power in this strat lies in the fact that you get a huge amount of health at early levels, a lot of extra damage, AND you have a ridiculous amount of sustain. This means that you are ALWAYS stronger, healthier, and able to pressure more since you’ll be able to outdamage and outsustain the other adc.

**Blade+Biscuit+Pot VS Other Common Starts** 

Long Sword + Pots: This one is pretty simple; the long sword gives the same amount of ad as the doran’s blade, and offers a decent amount of sustain with 2 pots, but is ALWAYS weaker in a trade / all in than the doran blade since the blade heals on every auto and offers 80hp on top of it. This means it’s very difficult for the sword user to all in the blade, but very easy for the blade user to all in the sword user. Since the blade user is stronger and has the advantage, he can ALWAYS be full health by simply sustaining on autos from last hitting and harassing.

Doran’s Blade + No Pots: I think this one is fairly obvious. Both blade users are equal in terms of hp and damage, but the person running 14/0/16 will have an extra 230hp in pots and sustain. This makes it ridiculously hard for the blade user with no pots to ever gain an advantage in lane (it’s like trying to start boots no pots vs boots + 3 hp pots).

Boots + Pots: In some matchups a boot start may make a large difference, but in general a 14/0/16 blade start does very well against boots + pots. It comes down to the blade user being able to ALWAYS out-trade and out-sustain, while also having 80hp on top of it, meaning it’s very very easy to gain an advantage and all in the boot user in the first couple levels. 

**Wait, doesn’t going only 14 in offense severely reduce your dps? What exactly do you lose by only going 14 in offense?** 

This was the reason I was VERY hesitant to even try to run this build in the first place. After trying it out a few games though, I can safely say that I don’t really notice much, if any change in my dps.

The EXACT stats you lose are:

* Increases damage by 2%
* +5% Crit Damage
* 10% AS for 2 seconds after landing a crit
* 5 armor pen
* Increases damage by 5% to targets below 50%

I’m going to disregard the crit bonuses since at that point in the game, being able to survive and proper positioning to get off more autos are way higher on my list of priorities than my autos doing slightly more sustained damage.

You can also try it yourself, but I notice little to no change in my dps mid-late game changing from 21 offensive to 14. I’m sure someone could run numbers (and if anyone has then I’d be interested in seeing them), but after running 14/0/16 a LOT of times, I’m convinced that the change has little to no impact on your dps as the game progresses.

What I’m interested in is how it’ll affect my early game damage. The 2% increase in damage is.. very very negligible early game. Over time it’ll add up slowly, but it has nowhere near the immediate effect that an extra hp pot will give you. 5 armor pen is also in the same boat, it’ll give you a few extra points in damage but nothing to write home about. I consider the extra 5% damage below 50% a wash since you won’t have it, and the enemy will also never have it since you generally won’t be below half hp in lane starting with dorans + hp pot + biscuit.

All of these passives added together do give a slightly noticable change in dps, but your hp pot will completely tip the balance in your favour once you start trading with a blade + hp pot running on top of it.

---

Now I've played a LOT of games with this mastery page and I love it. I would like feedback on if it's as good as I think it is, anything weak about this opening, or just ways to improve it in general.

(As a side-note, I'm running a standard 15ad/armor/mr page).

**I. Introduction**

The 2v1 lane swap has dominated the early game in the NA LCS. However, in the not-too-distant past, the standard was the 2v2 bot lane. In the W4D2 game, CLG vs CRS, CLG showed why that was the case, leveraging the blue side 2v1 lane to an easy dragon. It was an excellent play, using the bottom side map control to gain an easy, riskless lead. Let's take a look at what they did.

**Team Comps**

**CLG:** **Cho'gath** (HotshotGG), **Jarvan** (Chauster), **Lux** (Link115), **Vayne** (Doublelift), **Lulu** (Aphromoo)

**CRS:** **Tryndamere** (Voyboy), **Nocturne** (Saintvicious), **Kayle** (Nyjacky), **Miss Fortune** (Cop), **Alistar** (Elementz)

**[--&gt;Timeline Summary &amp; Analysis&lt;--](http://imgur.com/a/NDw5g#0)**


______________________________________________________________________________________________
**III. Key Idea: Early Game Information**

What makes CLG's play great is the excellent use of early game information and inference to mitigate any risk. They did not make any move without knowing it was safe. CLG was able to snowball their early game information into actions that created both advantages and opportunities for more information. With good foresight, the information CLG obtained turned into a free early game dragon. 

* 

**Information from the Pre-Game**

From [0:52], it's clear CLG had thoughts to attempt a blue steal, even before they knew where CRS was. It's very hard to say if they planned to invade no matter what, nor the reasoning behind whatever their plan was. It's possible they were confident in their level 1 or they knew from previous scrims that CRS was likely to set up such that there were less than 4 near blue. Alternatively, perhaps it was a potential plan, but only if CLG obtained more information. Looking at the 4v4 level 1 comps, CLG does seem to have a slight lead with Lux bind and Lulu's slow. If the tops would join in--and both had teleport--Cho'gath would also prove more useful.

It is also a possibility that CLG already had the dragon play in mind as well, which they would attempt if CRS tried a 2v1 swap, though again, it's hard to say. Tryndamere is very weak early game and has no wave clear or harass. This means he would be easy to bully and push upon with a 3v1. On the other hand, Cho'gath has good wave clear for a top lane, which would delay a counter 3v1 to an extent. Also, CLG had a decent comp to do an early dragon, with 2 shields and vayne's true damage. As we will see later, these actually become factors in the dragon play, so it is clear CLG uses the pick information well later on, if not from the very beginning.

**Summary:** It's hard to say for sure, but CLG may have used their knowledge of their team comp advantages to plan for the dragon play from the very start of the game.

* 

**Information from the Opening**

CLG's opening was very well thought out and synergized well with a potential blue invade. By fanning out and warding the way they did, they placed a ward as aggressively as possible, while ensuring they were safe and did not reveal their intentions and allows them to transition to their red jungle as 4.

Unlike before, we can be sure of how the information obtained from the opening affected CLG's decision. Seeing 4 members of CRS at [1:08], CLG immediately knew they could invade, and most likely inferred exactly how CRS would start based off the vision. But they did not leave it up to their inference. Instead, knowing CRS was in the red jungle, CLG knew Lux could safely ward the mid lane blue entrance [1:22]. From there, seeing only Kayle pass through, they could definitely tell Tryndamere and Kayle were taking wolves. Thus, they could safely invade blue with absolutely no risk and potentially kill Tryndamere if he hadn't warded, which he hadn't. The impressive aspect of this play isn't the blue steal or the first blood, but how CLG used the information information to gain more information and make the blue steal a completely riskless play. 

**Summary:** CLG saw CRS and played off of the information perfectly to execute a completely riskless blue steal.

* 

**Information from the Blue Steal**

Knowing they would invade blue, Cho'gath also made sure to ward their own blue, knowing CRS would counter in order to stay even with CLG. This allowed CLG to get a good timing on Nocturne's route. Also, CRS was forced to pull their top duo to secure the blue, which meant Cho'gath could trim the wave, so the top wave was smaller than the bot wave. By synthesizing this information, CLG knew they could go for a much faster tower push, with high potential for a followup dragon. By tower pushing, CLG knew CRS would almost certainly try a 3v1 push as well, since they would otherwise lose a tower for free, which then set CLG up for an easy dragon. To this end, Jarvan even left his big wraith unfinished, knowing it was important to get to the tower in time [2:37].

**Summary:** By using inference and information well, CLG essentially controlled Nocturne's path after the blue steal, keeping him top and setting themselves up for an easy dragon.

* 

**Information from the Tower Push**

At this point, CLG was able to see Nocturne back and knew exactly where everyone was. The advantages that built up from all their preparation meant Nocturne was still in base and Tryndamere was forced to the inner turret with a huge wave. From all this, CLG easily knew they could take the dragon for sure and went for it. 

**Summary:** CLG looked at the situation after the tower and made the easy dragon call.

* 

**Conclusion**

As you can see, CLG built upon their information to completely control the early game and get a free dragon. At any point in the process, if things weren't going as planned, CLG ensured they had the information to make a decision to stop and play standard as well, so the play was completely riskless. This is the true beauty of the play. For example, the events would have been exactly the same if CLG proceeded with the blue steal without Lux warding at [1:22], but CLG could not have known, which meant it was a much riskier play. CLG made extra precautions and ensured their play was risk-free.
______________________________________________________________________________________________
**IV. Counterplay**

After CRS showed themselves at [1:08], there was nothing they could realistically do to stop the dragon play without being disadvantaged in some other way, like being down a blue or a tower. They could have avoided a first blood by warding, but the death did not have any real effect on the dragon play. Overall, unless CRS has psychic powers or had seen this strategy before, there aren't many errors to point out. However, there definitely are things CRS could have done to prevent the dragon play. To properly discuss counterplay would take far too much space, so instead, let's take a very brief look at how CLG handled the situation. Indeed, COL tried more or less the exact same strategy against CLG just one day later, in the W4D3 COL vs CLG game. Briefly, here's what they did:

* **Send the AD/Support Bot** - It's hard to say if CLG did this in precaution to this strat or for some other reason. They did have a squishy 3 man dive against Jayce who is mobile and has nice long range wave clear, while COL has Jarvan/Taric, so it would make sense to 2v2 anyway. Whatever the reason, the ad/support bot obviously greatly lessens the ability to tower push and have lower map control to take dragon. With a wards at both blue entrances, CLG was able to take wolves safely while COL invaded, actually coming out ahead of their counterparts. However, since they were forced to run the long way to lane, the bot lanes leveled to 2 at the same time (literally within a second apart).  Chauster just countered the blue, coming out a bit ahead as he got golems as well. It could be interesting to see if the dragon advantage is exploited more and the 2v2 bot lane becomes more popular again.

* **Avoid Wards** - CLG, like CRS, saw the aggressive wraith entrance ward placed. However, everyone on CLG except Link did not show later on, so COL had less idea of where they were. Chauster and Hotshot moved to do golems to avoid being seen. Most likely, CLG made the move primarily to avoid any aggression on Chauster rather than any mind games about blue, but it is still important not to give out early game positioning information in most situations. If a team has a weker level 1 and has seen no one on the map, they will be less likely to invade.

______________________________________________________________________________________________
**V. Final Thoughts**

This early game play is not only interesting because of the great foresight and execution by CLG, which is what I mostly focused on in this post, but for the many possibilities a strategy like this could hold. As I alluded to in the introduction, the 2v2 bot lane that was dominant in the past was primarily to ensure dragon control. Can this strategy be generalized to a point where it forces the 2v2 to become the norm again? There are a lot of interesting topics to think about regarding the pre-laning phase, the first 2 or so minutes of the game. In many ways, it the most standard part of the game, with both teams beginning with equal knowledge and on equal footing. However, it is also one of the most variable phases of the game, with such little vision for both sides. In the future, I plan to explore the various openings and movements of the early game in more depth and hopefully create a theoretical framework in which to discuss the pre-laning phase.",,False,,t5_2wenn,False,,,True,t3_19q1sv,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/19q1sv/in_depth_analysis_blue_side_strats_a_look_at_clgs/,

It happens in the first 5-6 seconds and the commentators don't mention it.

At the front of the creep wave there's a full health minion, a ways behind that is a ~80 percent health minion.

Ordinarily, the full health minion walks in, yellowpete hits the 80 percent health minion once while the full health minion tanks 2 turret shots then is last hit by yellowpete.  The (originally) 80 percent health minion then gets shot once by the turret and yellowpete last hits it as well.

You can probably already guess what CandyPanda does and why it's so smart at this point, but to make it clear so we can really appreciate why CandyPanda is so good I'll explain it in detail anyways.

CandyPanda knows the ordinary situation to a tee and immediately understands that yellowpete is going to get both of the first two last hits. Most players would say 'darn' or not even understand why that's bad (you're pushed up and vulnerable to a gank, the enemy team is relatively safe and still getting all their farm).  Instead, CandyPanda draws on a mechanic that is rarely used or discussed.  He walks into the front minion, obstructing its path and pushing it across the lane, making the low health minion get hit by the turret first and forcing yellowpete to miss the impossible last hit.

The very beginning of each game of League of Legends presents an interesting dichotomy. On one hand, it is perhaps the most standard part of the game. In every single game, the 5 members of each team begin the game at the same locations at the same time. This means that at the outset, each team, through no action of their own, is intimately aware of the other's positioning. The teams have an accurate idea of each other's gold counts, and from this, a solid grasp on the potential itemization routes. They have the same map control and map vision. Each team knows these things, and knows that the other team knows.

Yet, the first part of each game can also be the most volatile. With no wards or creep waves, map vision is extremely limited. The lack of vision creates immense uncertainty and countless potential strategies to start the early game. At no other point in the game are either of these aspects, the standardization and the volatility, present in the same way for competitive play. 

This unique beginning phase of each game, which I will henceforth call the ""pre-laning phase"", is what we shall explore in depth as the first topic of my Competitive LoL Theory series. We will look at how competitive teams have adapted to counter both the shared knowledge caused by the identical starts and the volatility created by the unknown, and attempt to explain the pre-laning meta based off the theoretical framework created in these posts. 

Part 1 will act as an introductory post to present the basic concepts that will be necessary in our exploration of the pre-laning phase. We begin by defining the pre-laning phase and its main ideas in section II. We then examine unique characteristics of the pre-laning phase is sections III and IV. We end with a brief overview of openings in section V, which will be our focus for the future posts on this topic, and look ahead to Part 2 in section VI.

###II. The Pre-Laning Phase

**The pre-laning phase** is the first phase of the game, starting at [0:00] and ending, as the name implies, when the laning phase begins. In other words, it ends when focus has shifted away from opening objectives, primarily red and blue buff, and towards farming minions. This can occur as early as [1:55], but there is no upper limit to when the pre-laning phase must end. In most games, it occurs shortly after [2:00], once the lanes have helped their junglers, as CS offers greater and less volatile gains. Realistically, the pre-laning phase will not extend past ~[3:30], as the buffs will likely have been taken by that point, making any reward from invades negligible.

**Objectives**

As mentioned in the introduction, the pre-laning phase is unique in both the level of standardization and the volatility. The fixed, standard start allows for a surprising amount of information to be inferred, with the right use of game knowledge. Yet with a lack of map vision, teams are still extremely lacking in information. This means that gaining information in this phase of the game is all the more important. 

Strategies in the pre-laning phase, known as **openings** or **level 1 strategies**, revolve around optimizing information control to take advantages, using the inferable information they have at the start of the game to create new opportunities for information. They try to gain as much useful information as possible, while, at the same time, concealing as much as possible from the enemy.

Primarily, teams look to gain knowledge of enemy positioning or ward placement. Knowing where the enemy players are, or where they aren't, is invaluable for determining their strategy. This is especially true in cases of clear aggression, but even the smallest bit of vision can go a long way toward gaining an early game advantage, whether through countering an enemy's opening or preparing against jungle/lane setups. 

Below we will overview the distinctive features of the pre-laning phase, which teams can use to fully optimize their strategies around information control.

###III. Itemization

Unique to the pre-laning phase, gold values are more or less fixed, creating a fixed pool of potential starting item builds. There are 3 possible starting gold values, based on the Wealth mastery: 475, 500, and 525. Starting itemization is primarily focused toward the laning phase, so any conclusions about enemy openings based on itemization are questionable. However, understanding itemization can still be useful in the pre-laning phase. 

We will not delve deeply into the reasoning behind the items, as it is beyond the scope of this topic. For our pre-laning phase theory purposes, the main idea is that the fixed starting gold amounts make starting item builds predictable. It is possible that a player could buy less and leave the base with excess gold to trick opponents, but that requires the player to be spotted, and the player will have to either recall again at a riskier time or go to lane with fewer items. As it is, current top teams always fully use their starting gold.

In most cases, teams can use the predictable pool of item builds to determine warding information by the following process:

1. Gain vision of an enemy
2. Infer the starting item build
3. Count the wards in the current inventory
4. Determine how many wards have been placed

Along with other factors, teams may also be able to use itemization to determine when and where wards have been placed.

**Fig. 1: [Typical Starting Items and Builds](http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1b9649/competitive_lol_theory_an_introduction_to_the/c94wzps)**

**Example 1**

Elise passes over a ward with a sight ward and 9 potions in her inventory. The enemy team can then conclude with high probability that she dropped a ward.

**Example 2**

Sona is first spotted with a vision ward, sight ward, and 2 potions in her inventory. There are 2 potential itemization routes; she either dropped 2 pink wards or 3 green wards. However, teams are unlikely to use a pink ward unless they know they will kill a ward or are invading heavily. Teams are even less likely to use 2 pinks without knowing where enemy wards are, even in invades. Thus, there is a high likelihood Sona dropped 3 sight wards. 


___
###IV. Map Analysis

Another unique trait of the pre-laning phase is that the map is clean; throughout the rest of the game, pushing creep waves, unequal towers, and numerous jungle timers, all add pressure to different points of the map, creating areas of focus for each team. With a clean map, there are no such things. Instead, teams must consider the entire map to prepare for the map-wide jungle spawn times, [1:40] and [1:55]. With a clean map, there are certain map features teams should focus on.

**Terrain**

*Blue/Red Side Considerations*

At level 1, towers act as vision for the defending side and walls for invaders. This means that outside of dashes, there are only 4 entrances to the opposing jungle. In the middle of the 8 entrances lies the river, a relatively neutral ground. Outside of the jungle entrances, there are four additional routes to the river, through lanes. Inside each jungle are the main targets: red/blue buff.

As the first line of defense, the 4 entrances on each side are the focal points of the pre-laning phase, around which teams look to gain information. Once into enemy territory, invaders have far fewer exits than the defenders and are farther away from their own structures, making invades risky. However, with the 2 buffs, select locations within the jungle are important secondary focal points.

*Top/Bottom Side Considerations*

Mobility is a huge factor throughout the game, which means the middle of the map will be more contested than the top/bottom sides. The pre-laning phase is no different. Thus, everything else equal, locations up the middle of the map have higher priority than those towards the end.

**Fig. 2: [Map Terrain Overview](http://imgur.com/a/p8NVM#0)**

**Timings**

With such little starting map vision, predicting enemy positioning based on inference is an especially important skill in the pre-laning phase. **Timings**, in context with the pre-laning phase, refer to the times needed to move between various points on the map. Understanding timings allows teams to estimate past, present, and future enemy positioning. 

When the game starts, each team spawns in their base. Therefore, with timings, each team knows where the other can potentially be at a certain time, so teams know which areas are unsafe. Timings that start from the base, or **base timings**, are especially noteworthy, since they are applicable in every single game.

If an enemy player is spotted, the information refreshes; the team knows where the player might have been, and where they may go within a certain time span. By using other information in conjunction with timings, teams may infer valuable information like openings, ward placements, or jungle/lane setups. Thus, timings play a large role in dictating map movement and warding patterns, as teams attempt to hide as much information from the enemy as possible.

###V. Openings

Let's now briefly overview openings, which will be our focus for future posts on this topic. 

As mentioned above, a good opening must be tailored toward information control. Understanding the ideas in sections III and IV are crucial to that end; a level 1 strategy must not freely expose information. Strong openings must also be adaptable, ready to counteract the enemy's strategy. 

**Initial &amp; Reactive Stages**

It is often helpful to think of a level 1 strategy in 2 stages. 

The **initial stage** is the first stage of an opening, before the team gains any new information. The movements and warding patterns in this stage should be predetermined, as teams have no information with which to adapt their openings.

The **reactive stage** occurs once the team gains useful information and can then reassess their opening and make any necessary reactions to the new information. Ideally, a team will have thought through all the scenarios, and will adapt to any new information smoothly. 

**The 3 Types of Openings**

Generally, openings can be grouped in 3 categories: Passive, Early Invade, and Late Invade strategies.

*Passive*

As the name implies, **passive openings** are focused on guarding the jungle against invades with passive warding/human warding. They are the most commonly used openings, as they are safe and carry little downside risk. Passive openings can be aggressive, but only in response to enemy aggression.

**Fig. 4: [Passive Opening Example](http://imgur.com/a/p8NVM#12)**

*Early Invade*

Similarly, **early invade openings** are self explanatory. The invade is attempted well before the jungle camps spawn at [1:40], typically to establish aggressive warding rather than buff control, as early invades give ample time for the enemy to respond. In rare cases where teams are confident they have not been seen, buff stealing is still a possibility. Early invades are the most diverse type of openings, as teams choose when, where, and how aggressively to invade.

**Fig. 5-7: [3 Early Invade Examples](http://imgur.com/a/p8NVM#13)**

*Late Invade*

**Late invade openings** typically begin with a passive setup to hide information from the enemy. The invade begins just before [1:40] or [1:55], when jungle camps spawn, or immediately after the first buffs have been taken. Late invades attempt to gain buff and map control advantages, hoping to catch the enemy team unprepared. Teams usually invade blue, as it is a much safer target.

**Fig. 8: [Late Invade Example](http://imgur.com/a/p8NVM#16)**

The opening that a team chooses depends on many factors, such as picks, knowledge of the enemy team, and general team preferences.

###VI. In Part 2

In this introductory post, we barely skimmed the surface in terms of exploring the pre-laning phase. However, the necessary foundations have been laid out to take a deeper look. The next posts on this topic will be going far more in-depth, examining each of the 3 kinds of openings and analyzing specific openings strategies using the concepts discussed in this post. Part 2 will begin this examination with what is currently the most common type of level 1 strategy: passive openings.",,False,,t5_2wenn,1365392618.0,,,True,t3_1b9649,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1b9649/competitive_lol_theory_an_introduction_to_the/,

1371572345.0,62,self.summoners,1glbia,Detailed Analysis of NA LCS Superweek with Statistics!,76,14,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1glbia/detailed_analysis_of_na_lcs_superweek_with/,"In my last article titled “6 Things LCS can Improve on,” two of the biggest things I wanted to see from the LCS is more statistics and analysis of the teams. For the Superweek I parsed a ton of the data from the 20 games and they have lead to some interesting insight into the current meta of the NA scene. This article will break down the different team play styles, snowballing, and some bonus quick stats, with EU vs. NA and champion analysis continued in the comments!

**Teams**

Out of all the teams performances in this weeks LCS, three teams, TSM, Dig, and C9, stood out the most in their performance and statistics. Breaking down things like FB (first blood), objective control, and total kills we get exciting insight into how their actions show their priorities as a team and create unique play styles for each team. Analyzing these statistics actually gave a lot of insight not just into the meta, but also into the teams specifically as we see different play styles and priorities coming from each team. I am going to highlight a few of their picks and play styles that really stood out to me. 

**TSM**

The first interesting team to look at is the “aggressive” TSM. People always hype TSM’s aggressiveness and their playmaker Reginald, but ever since late last split TSM has been singing a different tune on their aggressive plays, focusing objectives rather than kills. Their matches had the slowest first bloods of any games, coming in at an average of 9:05 (compared to the week’s average of 5:40). They prioritize kills the least and they have even said in interviews that they don’t go after kills unless it will provide objectives. This is clearly seen as they have given up FB 4 out of their 5 games. Despite their games averaging the slowest FBs, they have the fastest objectives in the league. TSM took dragon all 5 games for themselves and averaged at the quickest pace (8 min and 25 seconds, compared to league average of 9:55). They also force slightly faster first towers at the pace of 6:34, compared to the average 6:54. This prioritization of objectives over kills shows in their picks as well as they often choose Shen or jungle Elise. Oddone’s Elise is a priority pick for TSM not just because he hit challenger with it, but because Elise is one of the best early dragon takers due to her spiders acting as the tank which is essential to mitigate the high amount of damage that Dragon does early game. Out of the 4 quickest dragons during the week, TSM got 3 of them - all with Elise jungle. TSM’s objective focused play style can also be seen in their kill/death stats, having the lowest team kills (54, 2nd lowest is VES at 57) in the league but also the lowest team deaths (45, 2nd lowest is VUL at 57)). While people have been saying “TSM is getting back to their roots from s2” I think this is untrue, as they played a tanky-dps team fight oriented style back then and their style now is more close to the Season 2 CLG style of “objectives over teamfights”. 

**Dignitas**

On the other side of the coin, we look at Dignitas. Dignitas actually has the highest amount of kills per average game, at 18.64 (the average being 14.9). They also average the fastest FB time of any team, coming in at 4:23 compared to the league average at 5:40. However, at the same time they have by FAR the slowest tower and Dragon times out of any other team, averaging 11:53 Dragon time (vs. league average 9:55), and 8:53 average tower time (vs. league average 6:54). These slow times come from Dig’s tendency to 2v2 over 2v1. In the 20 games of Superweek there were only three 2v2 matchups in NA, every other game was 2v1 mid/top vs 2v1 bot. All three of these 2v2s were forced by Dignitas. Many may attribute this to “slow adoption of the meta” and think that this contributed to Dig’s poor performance this week yet on the contrary in all three of these 2v2 games Dignitas ‘won’ the early game and came out with a gold lead at 10 minutes. Both of Dig’s wins were in these 3 games and the 3rd was the CLG/Dig game which... we all knew what a mess that was. I believe that Dig’s 2v2 abilities will be very important going forward as I believe the 3.8 patch will bring forth more 2v2 style in the NA LCS. 

**\#c9hypetrain**

The last team I am going to look at is the very hyped Cloud 9. Going into this super week I strongly felt that they were going to do well yet their play still surprised me significantly - not just due to the resulting 5-0, but in HOW they got that 5-0. Many people attribute their success to ‘replicating the korean scene’ but I believe that extremely cheapens their accomplishments. What Cloud 9 showed in this super week was not strategic brilliance, or extreme mechanical skill (like we often see from ‘new talent’ teams), but a very poised and flexible team who has great decision making abilities. Cloud 9 does not get the fastest towers or push the most out of any team nor do they get an early advantage every game. They prioritize objectives, but there is nothing exceptional about it. They have average FB timers (5:36), a bit slower than average dragon timer (10:57), a bit faster tower timer (6:20), and they only got out to an early lead 2 out of 5 games. This is what makes Cloud 9 the scariest team in the league. They play like an experienced team despite this being their first week in LCS, they don’t get flustered when behind, they don’t throw games that they have the advantage in - they just play solid with excellent teamfighting skills (as seen by them having the 2nd highest assist per kill average, only beaten by CLG’s inflated stats due to their long games and thus having more teamfights than the average team).

**Snowballing**

The next big topic is one that comes up a lot in interviews with players: the issue of snowballing. Often times a lane getting first blood is attributed to it’s success, or when they gave up that dragon it doomed them - but how strong is the correlation between these things? I broke down the “snowball” effect on 6 possible advantages and looked at their correlation with winning. These six factors were first blood, first tower, first dragon, first baron, gold advantage at 10 minutes, and gold advantage at 20 minutes. 

* First blood was the most neutral statistic with the winning team scoring first blood in 50% of the games, therefore it seems to have no impact on the winner. Also, first blood didn’t have much of a pattern to it, with the average time being 5 min 40 sec and almost equally in all 3 lanes (6 top, 5 mid, 6 bot, 3 drag). 
* The next statistic, first tower, was also fairly neutral with 55% of the teams scoring first tower going on to win the game. The first tower fell on average at 6:54, was way more often top and bot than mid (6 top, 3 mid, 11 bot), and was favored to the blue side (13 purple tower deaths, 7 blue deaths).  
* The most bizarre statistic goes to first dragon (average time 9:55), which had a 40% win rate. More teams who got the first dragon went on to lose the game than win the game. This statistic really confused me at first but I think this can be attributed to the successful counter-play that has come from dragon fights, as often times teams will trade towers or kills for this dragon, and it often puts the team that initially started dragon into a vulnerable position to be ganked. 
* The last neutral objective statistic - first Baron - leads to the highest win rate as expected, yet still a bit lower than predicted, at 66.6%.  The average time for the first Baron is 28:32. Baron is becoming less of a snowball instrument for teams as pushing has gained increased priority. Baron has become more of a common comeback attempt, as 1/3rd of the successful barons were gotten by teams who at the time had a gold disadvantage. This is often due to the fact that after winning a teamfight as a losing team you don’t have the map pressure to take towers, and so instead they will take baron to give a few minute buffer to try and make a stronger comeback and deny objectives from the other team. 
* The next snowball factor to look at is gold lead at 10 minutes. This was the most definitive early factor with 64.7% of teams with a gold lead at 10 minutes going on to win the game. Of these advantages, the leading team averaged 13.5k gold while the trailing team averaged 12.2k, which is about a 10% lead. The largest lead was by team CST over team VUL on the first day of Superweek, coming in at 14.5k gold vs 11.8k gold with CST winning the game. While many people would think that blue side would tend to lead early game due to the double golem advantages, it turns out purple actually gets out to an early lead more often at a rate of 76.47%! 
* The last factor tracked was the gold advantage at 20 min. This is the biggest predictor of win likeliness, with 70% of teams at a 20 minute gold lead going on to win their games. Of those teams who had a gold advantage at 10 minutes, 76.5% of them went on to keep their advantage at the 20 minute mark as well.  

**Bonus Statistic Quick Fires (Stats are from NA Superweek)**

* Average time for an LCS game is 38:20, for a CLG game it is 52:46.
* If game time had a normal distribution , the probability of the 71 minute Dig vs. CLG game is 0.2% (1 in 335 games). [mean = 38.345, std = 11.95]
* Team Velocity has both the lowest kills per average game of any team (12.4), and the highest deaths per average game (21.76). 
* At 10 minutes the gold lead went to the Purple team 76.4% of the time. 
* The Blue team wins 60% of the games. 
* The team with the lead in gold at 10 minutes continues to lead at 20 minutes 76.4% of the time.
* NA picked or banned 47.8% of all champs, while EU only picked or banned 41%.

1371334937.0,63,self.summoners,1gf7lk,Zone control and in-depth game knowledge. A look at NA LCS ADCs.,72,9,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1gf7lk/zone_control_and_indepth_game_knowledge_a_look_at/,"Seeing as how everyone is on the flame Crs.Cop train, without giving in-depth reasons why he is being flamed, I'll give it a try.

I came from competitive DotA2 scene, relatively unknown player. But in the scene, there is something that is called **Zone Control**.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ihVc2swLPQ
This is a video about DotA2 zone control, but it is similar enough to explain.

Basically zone control is the most important mechanical skill that everyone playing any role should have, and this is especially important on ADCs, as they deal the most damage but die the fastest. Zone control requires in-depth game knowledge to the point where you have to know the potential of every single champion as well as your own champion's potential.

Let's look at some examples:
**Doublelift's vayne performance against MRN** http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7uvXALE3OM
**Wildturtle's draven 2v2 against CLG**
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVbukS8x_4w

As you can see from Doublelift's vayne game, he did not back off and run at any point of the fight. He knows what his champion is capable of, and what the other 5 enemy champions are able to do. Notice how he focuses the enemy in the fight.

* He hits whatever is in-front of him, very typical of any adc.

* But whenever an enemy with hard cc (off cool down) enters into his zone of engagement, he switches targets to them.

His focus in the fight was this:
Alistar-&gt;used his combo-&gt;Shen-&gt;burned taunt on teammates-&gt;Irelia-&gt;died-&gt;Shen-&gt;died-&gt;diana.

He understands each enemy champion's cool downs and potential zone of engagements, and whenever a hard cc threat stepped into his zone, he focused the hard cc. He understands vayne's power is in her kiting tools, and that hard cc's counter kiting, therefore he must remove all the threats that stop him from getting the maximum effectiveness out of his champion.

Now let's look at Wildturtle's draven play. Partly due to Xpecial's great thresh play as well.

* They first get engaged on by leona, and draven and thresh are both below half health.

* Most people would run from that situation, because ezreal still has arcane shift to enter the battle. But Xpecial and Wildturtle both notice that leona has now stepped into the most important zone, the tower range.

* This means that leona has entered 3 enemy zones: Draven, thresh, and the tower.

* Wildturtle also notices that ezreal is focusing thresh, and has not entered the zone where he would be in danger.

* Though CLG has the health advantage, TSM now has a 3v2 situation where leona is engaged by 3 champions while thresh is being attacked by only 2.

* Now doublelift arcane shifts into draven's zone of engagement, and although wildturtle is very low on health, he knows the limits of both champions and knows that he has barrier up and baits the double kill.

After analyzing those two amazing adc players, let's look at cop's play. This clip is probably the one most mentioned as his .90 net miss.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94xfOX6aQAQ

* He stands very far behind blitz, and although he is low health, it shows that he does not fully understand blitzcrank's kit and cc potential.

* Varus gets away with his barrier and one auto left, but cop decides to not engage and take the kill.

* He cannot be engaged by thresh hook, as he is standing behind 2 creeps.

* Thresh has already used flay to disengage from blitzcrank.

* Leesin and kayle were both just exiting tribush, not within any zone of engagement of caitlyn.

* Caitlyn had barrier up within 2 seconds after engagement and flash.

Cop did the typical low level adc thing, where you back off a kill with the threat of 4 people running at you. You can see this in almost every single Curse fight, where he positions ""well"" and survives the fight, but does not get off any damage.

What an adc has to do is take the most damage and deal the most damage, without dying. We all saw doublelift's graves play against dignitas this week, he was engaged on, but dealt damage throughout the fight without running too far away.

Cop does not understand zone control and zones of engagement, that is why he plays too passive, fearing death. What he doesn't realize is that as an adc, you have to be in the fight to deal damage and that means sometimes your safe zone will be threatened, but knowing how to deal with that is what separates good adcs and bad adcs.

TL;DR Learn some zone control...everybody.

    iMp RusH (7:54): We have a porfesional Starcraft 2 team, and a Counter strike team, and now looking to get a high level league of legends team
    you guys would get benefits such as: overlays for streams, you would be able to get team jerseys
    you would be the manager, and you would be one of the co-managers of the organization
     (7:56): In the future we would be able to pay for the team to go to events
    such as LCS

    Morbuzaan (8:30): That's obscene
    You expect to pay us $500/month total
    And then take 100% of our prize money?
    We've won more than $500 in prize money in the 3 weeks we've been a team
    iMp RusH (8:31): considering one of the only tournaments you won you only got $600
    Morbuzaan (8:32): I've talked to a number of organizations interested in our team
    And you're the only one that's planning on taking prize money
    iMp RusH (8:33): How much of the prize money are other organizations planning to take?
    Morbuzaan (8:33): 0%
    iMp RusH (8:33): then how do they make any money off of it, and stay as an organization
    sponsors wont give that much
    unless you are a top level professional team
    Morbuzaan (8:34): You'd have to ask them
    iMp RusH (8:34): That just makes no sense to me.
    Morbuzaan (8:34): Well it makes no sense to me why we would join your organization if you're planning on taking our prize money, and paying us less than we win
    We'd literally be losing money to advertise your company
    iMp RusH (8:36): We are not looking to lose money by having a LoL team
    i guess were just on a different page.
    Morbuzaan (8:36): And we're not looking to lose money by joining an organization
    Why would we do that?
    I think you'll find every other competitive LoL team would agree with me
    iMp RusH (8:37): not sure how other organizations are offering that, but i guess they will probably die off soon, so anyways, goodluck
    Morbuzaan (8:37): Yeah, good luck finding a team

**I. Introduction**

Teamfighting is one of the most important, and often overlooked, aspect of a competitive match. Analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of a team's fighting ability goes a long way toward learning about the strengths and weaknesses of a team as a whole. It is a factor that can make or break a game, as it did for the W3D1 game: CLG vs DIG. Public opinions of CLG and DIG are polar opposites after W3, but those opinions were fueled by wins and losses. Few attempted to look further, into the actual gameplay, to substantiate their opinion. To that end, let's take an in depth look at the teamfights of the CLG vs DIG game to see what we can glean about the two teams' abilities.

**Team Comps**

**CLG:** **Galio** (HotshotGG), **Dr. Mundo** (Chauster), **Ahri** (Link115), **Kog'Maw** (Doublelift), **Alistar** (Aphromoo)

**DIG:** **Singed** (KiwiKid), **Vi** (Crumbzz), **Kayle** (Scarra), **Draven** (Imaqtpie), **Zyra** (Patoy)

The teamfighting potential for each comp is similar enough. DIG is stronger in a pure theoretic 5v5 engage, but each team has the CC and maneuverability to win a teamfight. As things turn out, Mundo proves to be rather useless for the specific teamfights that happen. Nonetheless, the teamfights were not decided by the picks.

**II. Teamfight 1: [19:30-20:03]**

**[Teamfight Description &amp; Analysis](http://imgur.com/a/DFJXg/layout/horizontal#0)**

**Main Ideas:**

Vi's initiation onto CLG was bad on 3 levels. As the champion furthest out in front, using gap closers only puts her farther ahead, making it even harder to follow up. Furthermore, the rest of the team's positioning behind the turret created an obstacle that slowed them and forced them to group up if they were to get to the target, Kog, as fast as possible (which they had to do given how deep Vi had gone). Lastly, Kog was not particularly out of position or behind his teammates, which allowed the members to easily prepare to zone/peel. Because of these factors, CLG won the instant Vi initiated. 

To their credit, CLG played as they should. Alistar was ready to zone, and the other tanks protected Kog. They smoothly chained CC as CLG took advantage of the poor positioning Vi had created with a 3 man stun. However, Kog's mistake, dying to tower, stopped CLG's chances to take real advantage of the situation, which may have cost them the chance to snowball to an easy victory.

**In Brief: DIG initiated poorly; CLG peeled and zoned properly; Both Kog and Draven died for no reason; 3-2 CLG**
______________________________________________________________________________________________
**III. Teamfight 2: [22:19-22:43]**

**[Teamfight Description &amp; Analysis](http://imgur.com/a/wqaqT#0)**

**Main Ideas:**

Once again, Vi's initiates far out in front of her team, perhaps even farther than the previous fight. However, this initiation differs from the previous one in several respects. First, the tower is in the center of the lane, and most of DIG is well spread out, so it doesn't act as an obstacle. Second, Vi is not forced to use her vault breaker in conjunction to her ult, giving her an easy escape. Third, DIG is aware from last fight that Kog used flash. Fourth, and most importantly, Kog is out of position with respect to his team. Kog chose to compromise his positioning to avoid the bit of damage from a Draven ult, a big mistake. 

Even with all this, this is a very questionable engagement. Vi is far out of position, and had CLG peeled correctly, it's very possible CLG would have won another easy teamfight. However, the entire tank line completely ignores Kog and runs to the DIG carries instead, leaving huge holes for DIG to exploit. In addition, despite lacking a tank line, the DIG carries are safe because they have a turret behind them, and are primarily attacked by tanks. Kayle and Zyra do a good job switching the CLG's aggro. Meanwhile, Draven is protected behind them, allowing him to safely dish out autoattacks. Along with the tower, Draven also acts as a deterrent against CLG aggressing too far forward. All of these factors were apparent before Vi finished her ult, yet CLG failed to recognize them. As a result, Kog dies for free.

CLG should have approached this fight in a similar manner to the previous one, with Alistar zoning, and the rest of the team using their short CD skills to chunk and slow Vi for free. Instead CLG completely zeroed in on getting to the DIG carries, ignoring their own carries, falling out of position, and failing to account for the off-cooldown CC and skills of DIG. Galio, in particular, failed to account for the enemy CC and has his ult canceled immediately. Ahri wasted her CC twice, which she could have used to peel the tanks off of Kog both times. 

**In Brief: DIG initiated questionably; CLG failed to peel for Kog and focused too hard on DIG carries; 2-0 DIG**
______________________________________________________________________________________________
**IV. Teamfight 3: [26:35-27:33]**

**[Teamfight Description &amp; Analysis](http://imgur.com/a/FweS1#0)**

**Main Ideas:**

Both teams fail to account for and take advantage of the choke point. From the start, CLG find themselves in bad position with respect to the choke, because of their blue steal. They are thus forced to burn ults and take free damage. DIG then find themselves in bad position, with their tanks split from their carries thanks to the choke point, but CLG fails to capitalize. Like the last fight, Galio zeros in too hard on ulting when he should be taking the time to assess the situation and the skills of the enemy team. With flash up, he has the luxury of sitting back and waiting for the perfect moment. Instead, he overextends past the choke, making it very difficult for his team to follow up, even if the Zyra ult had not interrupted him. Ahri also repeats her mistakes, wasting her CC another two times, which could have been used to hit the DIG carries. 

CLG should have slowly kited the tanks once DIG was out of position, saving their hard CC spells in the situation that the DIG carries tried to move through the choke. The results could have been anywhere from a 5-0 ace to a 0-0 fight with hp and summoner advantage for CLG, depending on how DIG responded, but CLG definitely would have won. Overall, this is less than ideal play from both teams. 

**In Brief: DIG positioned poorly with respect to the choke point; CLG failed to capitalize as Galio flashed and ulted out of position; 5-2 DIG**
______________________________________________________________________________________________
**V. Teamfight 4: [30:20-31:14]**

**[Teamfight Description &amp; Analysis](http://imgur.com/a/dTl4T#0)**

**Main Ideas:**

This teamfight is a huge series of mistakes:

Kog chooses to farm bot, despite knowing DIG was grouped and clearing baron wards. Galio once again focuses only on landing an ult, failing to read the situation; baron was too low to reasonably steal, and none of his team was in position. Singed then chases CLG for no reason and gets caught. DIG blindly runs into an unwarded brush they know CLG is in, leading the charge with Zyra. Ahri does a good job to burst her, but then chooses to waste a dash getting close to Draven, despite having just used her burst. Vi then makes the mistake of ulting Ahri even when there is still one dash left. The other members of DIG then group up into a choke trying to help Vi. However, Alistar uses his combo too early as Kog's focus was just on Vi, failing to remember Kayle's ult for the second fight in a row. This is a very sloppy teamfight by both sides. 

**In Brief: Both teams made a slew of poor mistakes that teams with their experience shouldn't be making; 5-2 DIG**
______________________________________________________________________________________________
**VI. Key Points**

***CLG***

* **Protect the Carries** - Twice, Vi dove upon Kog'maw. In the first instance, CLG supported him, and in the other, they left him alone. Unsurprisingly, CLG won the first fight and lost the second. It is odd that CLG would play so well one time, and then fail the next. There were some differences, such as the distance between them and the tower, that may have made CLG overaggressive in the second fight. However, the two fights were quite similar overall, so the reaction should have been the same. In the situation of a deep dive initiation, the first instinct should always be to help the carry; it not only ensures the carry is safe, but also grants an opportunity for completely free damage to the initiator.

* **Use Abilities Wisely** - Unfortunately, both Hotshot and Link wasted their skills at inopportune times. For Hotshot, it's apparent that his only goal was to land his ult and capture most of DIG within it, a goal in which he succeeded each time. However, he failed to pay attention to the situation and the abilities of DIG. Outside of the first fight, he either ulted in bad position, was immediately interrupted, or both. Galio ult is a gamechanging ability and a huge part of Galio's kit. Being aware of the situation is necessary for all heroes and skills, but it is especially important for Galio's ult. Hotshot needs to be less hasty and focus not only on landing his abilities on many people, but also on enemy CCs and the teamfight situation. Link also failed to properly use Ahri's CC. Often, he cast it just because it was up, despite a low chance of actually hitting someone. Other times, he used it uselessly on tank and supports, who were no threat and weren't being focused. In almost all cases, opportunities arose later to use charm to great effect, but it was on cooldown. Again, it's important to look at the situation and hold on to spells for the right opportunity.

* **Track Enemy Cooldowns** - By failing to keep track of the enemy abilities, CLG was baited into overaggression. Going hand in hand with the previous point, Galio's ult was interrupted immediately twice as he did not ensure the DIG CC had been used. Kayle ult proved huge two times as well, turning CLG's aggressiveness into poor positioning and easy cleanup. Kayle ult was the most important ult on DIG's team, and it is imperative to keep track of such skills. Failing tp account for the skill first time was not good, but failing a second time soon after is unacceptable. Keeping track of such skills individually is hard, so CLG must strengthen their team communication during teamfights and keep track of skills together.

***DIG***

* **Initiate Smartly** - Vi initiated twice, far ahead of her team. The first time, it turned into an easy CLG victory. The second time went much better, but CLG did not play ideally. It's very plausible the second initiation would have ended with a loss as well, had CLG properly peeled. Either way, DIG must be cognizant of the team's overall positioning. Diving so far ahead as an initiator makes any follow up impossible. It simply gives the enemy team an easy target. Though Vi has great initiation, Crumbzz still needs to be smart when going in.

***GENERAL***

* **Account for Map Terrain** - Both teams fail to make note of the different map structures at times. The third teamfight is the best example, as the fight centered around the ramp to blue buff. Both teams made positioning mistakes with respect to the choke. The first teamfight showed that a small obstacle, like a turret, can be huge, as it forced DIG to group up for an easy Alistar stun. Turrets behind DIG in the second fight created a safe zone to fall back to. CLG should have been deterred from trying to move forward, but failed to account for this. In general, I feel this is an area of competitive play all top teams recognize to an extent, but have not seriously emphasized directly. As a result, most teams have a subconcious feel for map terrain, but aren't always actively aware of it when they should be.

______________________________________________________________________________________________
**VII. Final Thoughts**

The only teamfight in which a team truly played well was CLG in the first teamfight (minus the Kog death). DIG often made the first mistake, but CLG didn't capitalize. Clearly, the teamfighting wasn't impressive for either team. There were bad initiates, poor spell usage, and plenty of dumb mistakes. Still, despite all the mistakes, it wasn't bad either. In absolute terms, both teams played poorly. However, even the best teams today are nowhere close to perfect. Judging by today's standards, the overall play for each team was fairly average, or even above average. But, of course, each of these teams is striving for perfection, so they must not be content with their play here.",,False,,t5_2wenn,1362085270.0,,,True,t3_19czl9,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/19czl9/in_depth_analysis_a_comprehensive_look_at_the/,

I think they do fantastic work and I appreciate all the effort they put into making league what it is.

With that said their design choices when it comes to item and champion balance lately have seemed somewhat short sighted and missguided.

First there was the overwhelming popularity of black cleaver. Early this season it was bought on everyone, including champions who didn't even use it well, because it was blown out of proportion by WingsofDeathx. Armor and MR are inefficient at the moment and having what armor you bought being shredded wasn't terribly appealing so people began to just stack health, leading to the discovery of Warmogs. 

With Warmogs now being rushed by everyone and used as the sole defensive item for nearly every champion Riot decided the problem was that warmogs was overpowered, rather than it being because it's hard to justify spending money on a lot of armor and MR and they buffed both the %HP items, Liandries Torment and Blade of the Ruined King. Liandries will likely be the next FOTM, So be prepared to deal with a lot of Vlads, Eves and Rumbles. 

I do agree that these items have caused a problem, However i don't agree with Riot's solution.

This is a MOBA. Games like these have always been finding out what's the strongest, Then finding out what's the best thing against choice A, Then finding out what's best against choice B, etc etc. It creates a healthy game environment by having a constantly shifting metagame. It keeps the players on their toes. 

However Riot seems to have adopted a policy for popular items and champions that's more about the communities over-reactions rather than actual game balance, handing out massive nerfs to whatever the most popular thing is this week rather than giving time for the community to adapt and find out the next best solution.

In situations where something is blatantly overpowered i understand nerfing it however when you do what you did to Rengar and completely kill the champions viability in the competitive scene all you're doing is wasting the time and effort of the players.

I just feel Riot's not letting the game evolve by itself and are only listening to the community.

That's my opinion anyway, I'd love to hear what you guys think.

TL;DR: Riot's recent balance changes seem to be massive knee-jerk nerfs in response to the communities massive knee-jerk over-reactions. ",,False,,t5_2wenn,False,,SejuaniPig,True,t3_19pxnx,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/19pxnx/i_hate_riots_current_balance_philosophy/,

1376083595.0,52,self.summoners,1k1vu6,An analysis of LCS Fans across the country [RESULTS],64,12,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1k1vu6/an_analysis_of_lcs_fans_across_the_country_results/,"Greetings Summoners!

The other day I put up a survey looking to learn which LCS teams you all support and a bit about where you all come from. Well the results have come in and I’ve collected the information into a few graphs and maps.

 

**[Which NA LCS teams have the most fans?](http://i.imgur.com/oCdUUy6.png)**

-**TSM and CLG were the favorite teams** for over half of respondents with TSM having the edge by 6%

-**Curse was in third** place and it was actually **Cloud 9 in fourth**. Their excellent performance this split has won them more fans than the more established Dig, Vulcun, or Coast.

  


**[Where can LCS fans be found?] (http://i.imgur.com/WNQzzwW.png)**

-**California** has by far the largest cluster of respondents followed by **New York** and **Texas**. 

-While this simply matches up with the more densely populated states in the US, taking a look at Google Search Trends for “league of legends lcs” shows that the same states searching for LCS online are also the ones where most responders can be found.

-There seems to be a concentration of fans around the **Great Lakes**.

 

 
**[What team is each state cheering for?](http://i.imgur.com/KBigxCd.png)**

-As the team with the biggest fan-base overall, **TSM** is the favorite team in the most states including the three most densely populated by LCS fans: California, New York, and Texas.

-**CLG** and **Curse** also win out in a few states and even **Cloud 9**, still relatively new to the scene, wins in Georgia and Maryland.

  


**[What other teams do fans like?](http://i.imgur.com/T4LorTN.png)**

-This is the most interesting to me. First we look at which team each responder says they MOST support. Then we look at which other teams they say they are fans of. We can see some interesting relationships between fan-bases.

-**Cloud 9 and Velocity fans also like TSM** which may be explained by the friendly relationship between the teams (for Cloud 9) or by the OddBros (Velocity)

-**Curse fans like CLG** next most, and **Dig fans are more partial to Curse**. In both cases Curse shares former members with both teams, Saintvicious  / Voyboy for CLG, and Voyboy / IWillDominate for Dig.



 
**Some caveats and assumptions**

-This is a quick and dirty analysis; the data reflects “r/lol &amp; r/summoners users who happened to click glaiveguy’s survey” and I don’t claim this to be a 100% accurate representation of the LCS fanbase.

-As you can see I am missing data for many states. I chose not to display results for states with fewer than 10 people represented (and even that few is lower than I’d typically go). In the future I’ll leave the survey up longer and hopefully garner more respondents.

-For those who feel reliable data shouldn’t get in the way of a neat visual, you can find a map showing the results for every state [here]( http://i.imgur.com/LkrXvnp.png). Don’t say I didn’t warn you!

-As many pointed out this is only showing the United States at the moment. This was my first time collecting data on LoL so I kept it smaller scale to see how things went. **I will run a follow-up survey before World Championships collecting data across all LoL playing regions.**

-I have data for the EU LCS teams as well and will post that as a follow-up in the coming days.

It was a great talk, although primarily focused on lessons for game designers, I thought some other folks might find it interesting.   Please keep in mind I'm an old ass man and I'm Bronze II, so I may misrepresent some of the nuance a bit.

So his talk jumped back and forth between examples from LoL and WoW.  But the jist of the message focused on teamplay and competitive mechanics where player agency was at the forefront.  Skills which do not promote interaction from teammates or the other team are not good skills.

For example, he gave Corki's 10% true damage passive as an example of a poorly designed competitive skill, because there is no counterplay... nothing other players can do about it.   Conversely, he talked about Garen's regeneration passive as a good example of a passive that allow for counter play (keeping poke on him to stop his passive from activating).  He also pointed to Twisted Fate's +gold passive as a dull teamplay skill.

He went deep on a comparison of Ryze and Morgana's stuns.   He discussed how they were balanced for range and cooldown, but mostly pointing out the Morgana's was better because it was a skillshot and allowed for much more dynamic play around positioning, minions, leading, etc.  It was very focused on the psychology of the players and how their reactions made the game better.  A Morgana who lands a stun feels more of a sense of accomplishment, likewise the enemy who manages to dodge it. 

He presented Caitlyn's ultimate as a great example of a skill which promotes teamplay because it could lead to ""heroic"" play.  I totally agree with that, one of the few situations in the game where you get clear credit for saving someone's ass.

He then spent a few minutes on Thresh's lantern, and played this Ashe/Thresh big plays video:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWacjXfNsRU

He was very excited about Thresh's lantern as an example of a skill which promotes good teamplay.  I came away with the impression that this is the kind of skill they're looking to do more and more in the future.  In the Q&amp;A someone asked if this increase in skillshot based abilities wouldn't make the game harder -- Caldwell said he wasn't concerned.

At one point in the talk he said they felt LoL has a real issue with clarity in team fights.  He said it was often very hard to assess threats and showed a screenshot of a big messy teamfight.   Unfortunately, this part of the talk ended with him putting up the same slide with ""WE'RE FIXING THIS"" on top, but no indication of how they plan to do so.  Good luck with that, Riot.

That's what I had in my notes, I might be misremembering or distorting some things, so maybe others who were there can elaborate.

Determining jungler money from CS

**Introduction:**

A judgment I'm finding difficult to make in my games is the amount of farm my jungler has - junglers in general get lower CS than laners but how much is their average CS worth compared to an average CS of a laner? As such, I will attempt to determine the average gold value of jungle CS compared to lane CS in different conditions, based off data from http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/ on the different types of minions and monsters in the game.



*The questions I want to ask are the following:*

* Approximately how much is one jungle CS worth compared to one lane CS?
* Is this different if the jungler is doing only wraiths/wolves compared to wraiths/wolves/golems? (This question due to the tendency to ignore golems as a jungler.)

*Assumptions and limitations on my study:*

* I am assuming jungler farm comes 100% from the jungle, disregarding lane tax.

* I am disregarding the money gained from buff monsters, because of the relatively low impact on average gold gain, plus the tendency to donate.

* I am assuming game lengths of 21 minutes/55 seconds and 41 minutes/55 seconds for two estimations, to test if there is a shift of the *relative average gold value* of CS.

**Data used for my calculations:**

* Melee minion gold value: **20 gold** - increasing by **~0,1666* per minute**
* Caster minion gold value: **15 gold** - increasing by **~0,1666* per minute**
* Siege minion gold value: **40 gold** - increasing by **~0,3333* per minute**

*= *Approximations based on gold increasing every 3 minutes to make an average for minutewise growth, as jungle camps grow per minute.*


* Wolf camp gold value: **55 gold plus 2x4 gold**. - increasing by (**0,65x1gold/minute**) and (**0,081x2gold/minute**)
* Wraith camp gold value: **30 gold plus 3x3 gold**. - increasing by (**0,72x1gold/minute**) and (**0,054x3gold/minute**)
* Golem camp gold value: 55 gold plus 15 gold. - increasing by (**0,8x1gold/minute**) and (**0,23x2gold/minute**)

Based on the above, I will approximate a gold value of CS from jungling and laning respectively in different points of the game to determine whether there is a linear correlation between the two. My math is rudimentary here, because I haven't studied math since 2003, and that was high school level math. (*Folkeskolematematik in Denmark where I'm from*):



To do this, I first need to calculate how much of a percentage of CS the different types of minions and monsters make. I start with laning.

**Percentage of minion types of CS, laning:**

We know that:

* Every 30 seconds a wave of 3 melee minions and 3 caster minions will spawn.

* Every third wave, a siege minion will spawn.

This makes three minion waves include the following minions:

* 9 Melee minions

* 9 Caster minions

* 1 Siege minion

Giving us 19 minions total, with **47,4%** of the minions being Melee, **47,4%** of the minions being Ranged and **5,3%** of the minions being Siege.

This means that I assume that for every 100 CS of a laner, he has 47 melee CS, 47 caster CS and 5 siege CS (This equals 99 CS due to approximations and rounding errors.)

**Percentage of minion types of CS, jungling:**

The approach here is a little different than the laning approach, since junglers choose when they are getting CS and as such, we can't assume the same as the laning CS.

I will make estimates based on two approaches: One doing wraiths/wolves and one doing all three types of small camps.

**Wraiths/Wolves clearing only:**

The jungler CS will consist of camps with the following contents:

* 1 Big Wraith

* 3 Small Wraiths

* 1 Giant Wolf

* 2 Small Wolves

This gives us percentages of the junglers CS as follows:

* 14,3% of his CS are Big Wraiths

* 42,3% of his CS are Small Wraiths

* 14,3% of his CS are Giant Wolves

* 28,6% of his CS are Small Wolves

(Total: 99,5%)

This means that I assume that for every 100 CS of a jungler doing the Wraith/Wolves farming only, he has *14,3 Big Wraiths, 42,3 Small Wraiths, 14,3 Giant Wolves and 28,6 Small Wolves.*

**Clearing all types of camps:**

The jungler CS will consist of camps with the following contents:

* 1 Big Golem

* 1 Small Golem

* 1 Big Wraith

* 3 Small Wraiths

* 1 Giant Wolf

* 2 Small Wolves

This gives us percentages of the junglers CS as follows:

* 11,1% of his CS are Big Golems

* 11,1% of his CS are Small Golems

* 11,1% of his CS are Big Wraiths

* 33,3% of his CS are Small Wraiths

* 11,1% of his CS are Giant Wolves

* 22,2% of his CS are Small Wolves

(Total: ~99,9%)

This means that I assume that for every 100 CS of a jungler doing the Wraith/Wolves farming only, he has *11,1 Big Golems, 11,1 Small Golems, 11,1 Big Wraiths, 33,3 Small Wraiths, 11,1 Giant Wolves and 22,2 Small Wolves.*



**Calculations, 21minutes55seconds game:**

For the 20 minute game, I will calculate the average gold worth of every type of minion and monster to base further calculations on. The calculations are made with the assumption that the junglers and laners get an equal amount of average CS per minute. The basis for the 50% calculation of gold value growth is to make the gold value reflect the average value of gold rather than the maximum value of gold per CS.

**Average gold value of monsters and minions:**

**Monsters**

* Big Golem average gold value - Base: 55 gold, Time addition: 0,5 x (0,8gold x 20 minutes = 8 gold) = **63 gold.**
* Small Golem average gold value - Base: 15gold, Time addition: 0,5 x (0,23gold x 20 minutes = 2,3 gold) = **17,3 gold.**
* Big Wraith average gold value - Base: 30gold, Time addition: 0,5 x (0,72gold x 20 minutes = 7,2 gold) = **37,2 gold.**
* Small Wraith average gold value - Base: 3 gold, Time addition: 0,5 x (0,054gold x 20 minutes = 0,54 gold) = **3,54 gold.**
* Giant Wolf average gold value - Base: 55 gold, Time addition: 0,5 x (0,65gold x 20 minutes = 6,5 gold) = **61,5 gold.**
* Small Wolf average gold value - Base: 4 gold, Time addition: 0,5 x (0,081gold x 20 minutes = 0,81 gold) = **4,81 gold.**

**Minions**

* Melee minion average gold value - Base: 20 gold, Time addition: 0,5 x (0,1666gold x 20 minutes = 1,6666 gold) = **21,6666 gold.**
* Caster minion average gold value - Base: 15 gold, Time addition: 0,5 x (0,1666gold x 20 minutes = 1,6666 gold) = **16,6666 gold.**
* Siege minion average gold value - Base: 40 gold, Time addition: 0,5 x (0,3333gold x 20 minutes = 3,3333 gold) = **43,3333 gold.**

**Gold distribution per 100 CS**

**Junglers:**

*Non golems:*

* Big Wraiths: 14,3 x 37,2 gold = 531,96 gold
* Small Wraiths: 42,3 x 3,54 gold = 149,742
* Giant Wolves: 14,3 x 61,5 gold = 879,45
* Small Wolves: 28,6 x 4,81 gold = 137,566

Total value of 100 CS for a non golem jungler: 1698,718 which gives us an average gold value per CS of **16,98718** gold.

*All camps:*

* Big Golems:11,1 x 63 gold = 699,3 gold
* Small Golems: 11,1 x 17,3 gold = 192,03 gold
* Big Wraiths: 11,1 x 37,2 gold = 412,92 gold
* Small Wraiths: 33,3 x 3,54 gold = 117,882 gold
* Giant Wolves: 11,1  x 61,5 gold = 682,65 gold
* Small Wolves: 22,2 x 4,81 gold = 106,782 gold

Total value of 100 CS for a golem jungler: 2211,564 which gives us an average gold value per CS of **22,11564** gold.

**Laners:**

* Melee minions: 47,4 x  21,6666 gold = 1026,99684 gold
* Small Wraiths: 47,4 x  16,6666 gold = 789,99684 gold
* Giant Wolves: 5,3 x  43,3333 gold = 229,66649 gold

Total value of 100 CS for a laner: 2046,66017 which gives us an average gold value per CS of **20,4666017** gold.

**Conclusion:**

The average gold value per CS in a 21 minute 55 seconds game for the various players look like this:

* The nongolem jungler: 16,98718 gold per CS
* The golem jungler: 22,11564 gold per CS
* The laner: 20,4666017 gold per CS

The junglers CS value compared to the laner is 83% and 108% respectively. Practically, this means that the jungler doing golems will have to farm **92,5 CS** to break even with a laner who has 100 CS, and the jungler not doing golems will have to farm **120,4 CS** to break even with the laner.

This indicates the importance of doing golems for a jungler in terms of farming and gives you an approximate metric of measuring if you have ""good farm"" as a jungler. Considering also that the numbers are so close to even added with the observation that most junglers average 40-50% of the CS of a good laner in most games, we know that to properly be a ""farm jungler"" you will need to farm all camps, and get upwards of 8-9 CS per minute compared to the laners 10 to consider the gold stream as viable as just putting the champion in a lane.

To round it all up, I urge everyone who's interested to look at my math and make corrections and comments on my assumptions and bases for my calculations. As I mentioned in one part, there are likely formulas and equations who could've made my work easier, but my knowledge of high level math is limited.

TL;DR - jungler CS is worth close to the same as laner CS, so your jungle farmer Shyvana needs to accrue 8-9 CS per minute to be viable as a ""farm"" jungler.",,False,,t5_2wenn,1371833017.0,,Ezreal,True,t3_1gsvtg,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1gsvtg/determining_approximate_jungler_gold_based_off_cs/,

1373155459.0,44,self.summoners,1hrxv5,2 Solo 1 Duo: The rise of generic solo laners in competitive play (analysis article),51,7,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1hrxv5/2_solo_1_duo_the_rise_of_generic_solo_laners_in/,"Until recently in League of Legends, players defined themselves by their roles, and more specifically, what lane they resided in. Lately however, this identity has become less fixed, and more often than not, incorrect. When once the AD carry and Support found themselves in a 2v2 bottom lane duel, they are now more commonly found pushing a turret 2v1 in the top or middle lanes. Likewise, top and middle laners are now subjected to 1v2s, required to stay alive, protect their turret, and farm what they can. This metagame shift, along with other progressions in strategy, has lead to the concept of having two generic solo laners, and one duo lane (2 solo 1 duo). This shift opens up a realm of new strategic possibilities for teams, and is something that I have found to be the most interesting meta shift in a long time.

First and foremost, it is important to explain what this change means for competitive strategy. In essence, teams will decide the location of each laner on a game-by-game basis, in order to fit what they hope to achieve with their strategy. An example of this would be to send Caitlyn &amp; Fiddlesticks middle, with the intention to fast-push the turret against a team with weak wave clear. A laner with superior dragon control, or team fight potential such as Orianna may then be placed bottom, with a split-pusher or duelist such as Zed being placed in the top lane. Looking at this structure, not much is different from the traditional lane setup; bottom simply swaps with the middle laner. However, it is not the result, or what you see, that is significant, but the thought process behind the decision. To elaborate, a team could run a traditional lane setup while still adopting the 2 solo 1 duo framework, as long as the location of the laners is not due to convention, but in order to implement a strategy.

So why is this lane setup superior to the traditional setup?  Simply put, a flexible strategy will destroy a rigid strategy any day of the week. By adopting the traditional lane setup, lane matchups become paramount as teams are forced to lane against their respective counterparts (top v top, mid v mid, etc). This means that if someone was counter-picked, or simply less skilled than their opponent, they were forced into an unfavourable matchup, usually relying on jungle pressure (which took pressure off the rest of the map). Interestingly, this was why the final pick was valued so highly for the top lane in North America for much of Season 2, due to the snowballing nature of top lane, and the pressure drawn from having a winning matchup.

In the current meta, and most notably in Korea, almost the opposite approach is adopted: champion picks are selected for the team composition and strategy, whereas the traditional lane matchups are not important. This is one of the main advantages of running 2 solos and 1 duo: you can pick for your team composition and generally not be forced into bad matchups, through lane swapping. It has been well documented in competitive play that team compositions are more important than lane matchups (unless a massive gold lead is accrued in the laning phase), and thus, picking for the team composition will always be superior to picking for the lane.

There have been many notable occasions where the 2 solo 1 duo setup has been used in competitive play – in fact every time a lane swap occurs, I would argue that it is being adopted. A prime example of a successful team using it is found in CJ Blaze, from the OGN (2nd place in Champions Spring 2013). The Blaze bottom lane, Cpt Jack and Lustboy, is notorious for dying in lane 2v2, despite having good team fight play and mechanics. For many of their games this season however, they adapted by laning 2v1 either middle or top – reducing the impact of one of the main weaknesses in their team. If they had followed the traditional lane setup, this weakness may have been a greater problem during Champions. In addition to this, the 2v1 lane allows Blaze to fast push an early turret with the jungler, to gain an early gold and map advantage. Thus, using the 2 solo 1 duo setup gave Blaze 2 notable benefits: 1) The ability to avoid their bottom lane’s weak laning phase and 2) Early strategic victory through fast pushing a turret.

Recent champion picks have also made it obvious that teams are now leaning towards two generic solo laners. To elaborate, five of the most popular solo lane choices in competitive play recently -Jayce, Kennen, Kha’Zix, Ryze, and Zed – all have previously been found in the traditional top and middle lanes. When previously there was well defined, non-overlapping champions for both the mid and top lanes, now the distinction is not so clear. Even champions who have only been played in the middle lane traditionally, such as Karthus or Orianna, have made their way to the top and bottom lanes commonly in the NA LCS, in order to implement specific strategies.

Another interesting change has been for many teams to recently swap their “official” top and mid positions. While this has little impact on where the players lane, it is significant because it symbolises that teams are also recognising that the two solo lanes are interchangeable. Cloud 9, Team Solo Mid, and Reapered’s old team all announced that they were swapping the top and mid positions, with Maknoon also talking about moving to mid. It appears that the reason for the change, with the exception of TSM, is to move the leaders of the teams (Hai, Reapered, Maknoon) to the middle lane; this may be indicative of a shotcalling position.

*Note: TSM’s Reginald moved to the top lane however, despite being the captain and shotcaller for his team. It has been speculated that this was so Reginald could conduct the picks and bans in the LCS himself, instead of having to go through Dyrus (as the top laner is first in champion select).*

The 2 solo 1 duo setup provides flexibility, allows for superior strategic control, and also provides the ability to pick for the desired team composition, without worrying about individual lane matchups. It is not a strategy, but a framework that provides teams all of these benefits. While it has already made its way into competitive play, it is a development in the meta that has been almost overlooked by the average viewer, up until recently. This advancement is one of the most interesting progressions in competitive strategy to date, and I believe it will be very important, moving forward in competitive play.

So, me and a friend started a page for the tourney and tried to get Riot's approval and help to spread it, but we're waiting for their answer.

It would be really helpful if you guys could make the word spread so more teams could participate and we could get some sponsors and get nice prizes for everyone, including skin codes for the viewers (if Riot sponsor us). We're thinking on making it like a Go4LoL with weekly matches and a monthly final for the best teams of the weekly matches and prize the 1st and maybe 2nd and 3rd of the monthly finals.

We hadn't got a thought in the prizes yet, but at first sight it would be something symbolic since we don't have money enough to afford a nice prize like keyboard and stuff, but we're looking forward to some RP Cards and stuff like that.

The eSports scene over here is growing but it's still slow atm, so we're trying to boost it up. If this tournament gets successful we can think about getting another tournament that isn't closed just for collegiates. And we're serious about this stuff.

We may not be able to stream all the matches, but we'll try to stream the maximum we can. Since our upload speed is pretty shitty, we might not be able to stream it at 720p but we'll try our best. I've got a reasonably nice setup (i5, 8gb RAM and a HD 7850 2gb), think it can holds the stream. My friend got a 1mbit upstream connection and i think we can stream, at least, 480p or something a lil better, MAYBE 720p (i'm not pro at streaming services/settings).

So, the facebook page we made is https://www.facebook.com/pages/Liga-Universit%C3%A1ria/219073511566036

We don't have enough money to pay someone to make a website for us and host it now, but we're working on making our own if we can get at least 1 or 2 sponsors to help us with the name/prize/etc things.

Sooo, I think this is all, thank you all guys &lt;3

**I. Introduction**

Fresh off an upset over CLG in W4D1, MRN followed it with a solid victory over TSM the next day. And while CLG vs MRN game was filled with mistakes and poor decisions as MRN struggled to close the game, MRN showed strong play throughout against TSM, as they took advantage of TSM's mid game disorganization. Let's take an in depth look at what happened.

**Team Comps**

**TSM:** **Rumble** (Dyrus), **Xin Zhao** (TheOddOne), **Xerath** (Reginald), **Miss Fortune** (Chaox), **Taric** (Xpecial)

**MRN:** **Akali** (MegaZero), **Jarvan** (ClakeyDee), **Nidalee** (ecco), **Tristana** (Heartbeat), **Alistar** (AtomicN)

 TSM's comp has a solid mix of physical and magic damage and good aoe, giving them stronger teamfighting capabilities over MRN. Xerath offers solid poke and wave clear, and they have enough CC peel for MRN's dives.

MRN's comp focuses on diving the back line with Jarvan and Akali. With Nidalee, they have good poke and a strong heal, but she greatly lowers their teamfighting ability. The team has strong sustain overall, with Nidalee, Alistar's aoe heal, and natural spell vamp for Akali, which proved useful with the poke Xerath provided.

**II. Early Game: [00:00-25:54]**

**[--&gt;[IMAGES] Early Game Timeline Analysis&lt;--](http://imgur.com/a/fAM4U#0)**

**Analytical Summary:**

The early game was extended and passive, due in large part to MRN's play. Both teams began with safe openings by guarding their four entrances, a very typical starting strategy, especially for MRN who has used it exclusively in their LCS games. TSM set up for their predictable 3v1 dive strategy and MRN countered by swapping their lanes as well.

*

With the role counterparts laning against each other, early game tower aggression was pacified.  MRN played passively, with Jarvan focused more on farming than ganking, which has been MRN's has approach to the early game in the past 2 LCS weeks. TSM was more aggressive on the gank path, but strong early game warding stifled any real success, amounting to a burnt Alistar flash [5:14]. This meant Jarvan took a small CS lead over Xin Zhao. However, TSM was able to out CS their lane opponents early, giving TSM the overall gold lead after 10 minutes.

*

Having little success against MRN's warding, TSM adapted by ganking through lane, and attempting a sneaky ward feint [10:42]. TSM focused on Akali, playing off her overaggression, but miscoordination ruined the first gank [11:01], which should have been first blood, and caused them to double pink ward on the fourth gank [25:54], which should not have been attempted in the first place. TSM also ganked top, unsuccessfully due to MRN's passive play, but stayed away from mid lane ganks on a mobile Nidalee.

*

After level 6, Akali gained the advantage over Rumble in CS and was able to bully him and even kill him as he wasted his CC [18:01], despite the ganks. Nidalee also gained the advantage mid lane by landing spears that forced Xerath to back [13:55][16:05] and cost him mid turret. Much of the action mid was not spectated, so it's hard to say for sure, but it's not unlikely Xerath's own aggression was the primary reason he was hit by so many spears. Throughout the game, Xerath showed a propensity to use his spells for little gain while putting himself in poor position, for example, in the early game at [16:02] and [22:39]. And while he warded well for much of the early game, he left his right side open at one point, which, along with his aggressive spell use, led to a successful MRN gank [18:09].

*

The most impactful event of the early game was the first dragon [15:02], which is also the hardest to analyze. First, Rumble's choice to recall seems odd on the surface, given the circumstances. But without knowing his thought process, it's difficult to judge. Similarly, it's difficult to say how much thought MRN put into the dragon play. There's no way they could be absolutely certain that TSM had no vision or that TSM was too far out of position to contest (which, if TSM had vision, they weren't), and MRN has attempted dragons in other games that they should not have. However, with good use of information and inference by MRN, the dragon call would be considered a good one. Without knowing exactly what MRN was thinking, it's again difficult to judge.

*

Whatever the case, the dragon was important because TSM had no idea it was taken, and thus had no timer for the second dragon. The gold gained from the dragons was a definite plus, but an even more important aspect is that it greatly extended the early game as there was no shift to objective control. While this didn't put TSM at any disadvantages outside of the gold, it stopped TSM from taking advantage of their superior teamfighting ability, in terms of both their skill as a team over MRN as well as their team comp.

*

Overall, both teams had solid early games. The warding was very good for the most part, and there weren't a ton of mental slip ups. With the gold gained from the dragons as well as a turret lead, MRN had the lead, but the passive overall play in the early game meant neither team gained a huge advantage. In all, MRN was up about 2k gold at the end of the early game.

*

**Short Summary:** MRN's passive play and strong warding, and the unnoticed first dragon, led to a passive, extended early game. Akali's overaggressive tendencies allowed TSM successful ganks, but miscoordination cost TSM some of those opportunities. Xerath's overaggressive spell use also cost him, both early and throughout the rest of the game. The dragon play had the most impact in the early game, but it is hard to analyze. Overall, both teams played the early game well, with good warding and and relatively few mental mistakes.

**III. Mid Game: [25:54-33:54]**

**[--&gt;[IMAGES] Mid Game Timeline Analysis&lt;--](http://imgur.com/a/uC5kL#0)**

**Analytical Summary:**

Finally, both teams were aware of dragon. Each team prepared for it properly, pushing their lanes and buying. MRN grouped first, so were able to take dragon control, but they were caught off guard by Xerath's ult, chunking 3 [27:44]. This gave dragon control to TSM, and they started it. However, MRN had good sustain and were able to come back. 

*

The fight was well played overall, save for two mistakes at the start. First, though he was not extremely far ahead of his team, Jarvan still initiated a bit too early. Four members of TSM responded properly by peeling for MF. Had Xerath been in position, TSM would have crushed MRN off of the initiation, as Tristana and Nidalee would have been zoned easily, leaving just Akali and Jarvan together, focused by TSM. 

*

However, Xerath concentrated on using his spells over his positioning. He focused an ulted Alistar, and was then forced to flash to make up for his bad position, meaning he had a poor angle on MRN, an important consideration with Xerath's spell kit. Essentially, TSM fought without Xerath, as all his damage output was on Alistar. Had he taken the time to be in position, his damage would have taken Akali down before she could kill MF, leading to a decisive victory. Instead, TSM came out with a negligible 3-2 kill advantage, despite the poor initiation and a better teamfighting comp.

*

After the fight, the lanes were pushing hard against TSM--unfortunate because their preparation before the dragon was solid [27:13] and there was no way to predict how the fight would turn out. With some good use of ward vision, MRN was able to stall TSM and gain a third uncontested dragon [28:28]. 

*

TSM then showed very poor mid game map control. MRN only had a slight lead, but they exerted some map pressure. TSM turtled hard in response and failed to take advantage of any moments to regain any vision control [31:06][31:18][31:37]. Instead, they placed a couple defensive wards and only moved to farm pushed lanes or small jungle camps, allowing MRN to move freely without pressure. This is a problem that TSM has shown in many games in the past, when they are just slightly behind and the enemy exerts some map presence.

*

The loss of map vision didn't have an impact on the next play, a baron, though the lack of control and the turtling mindset probably played a role. Still, TSM had vision of 5 MRN members clearing baron area. This should have been a clear red flag for TSM to group, but instead, Rumble continued to farm bot lane, an extremely poor and very confusing decision. MRN was able to easily take the baron and panicked TSM into a desperate teamfight that MRN easily won with TSM so out of position, which then led to a free inhibitor.

*

**Short Summary:** TSM beat MRN in a teamfight as Jarvan initiated early, but could have won it more decisively if Xerath had positioned better initially. Unfortunately, the lanes are pushing against TSM afterwards, leading to an easy dragon for MRN. TSM then turtled hard and lost map control. MRN forced a baron, but TSM failed to respond despite having vision and time to do so. A desperation play by TSM led to an easy teamfight victory and inhibitor for MRN. MRN took full advantage of very poor mid game play by TSM.
______________________________________________________________________________________________
**IV. Late Game: [33:54-38:52]**

**[--&gt;[IMAGES] Late Game Timeline Analysis&lt;--](http://imgur.com/a/pUGms#0)**

**Analytical Summary:**

MRN now had a significant advantage. TSM caught them offguard hiding in a brush as they tried to push bot, taking advantage of MRN's split positioning. However, MF was not with them and they were just too far behind. TSM would have won the fight were the game even, but Tristana was too strong and MRN eventually mopped up, taking another inhibitor. Xerath caught Tristana, but the game was essentially over at this point. 

*

MRN regrouped to finish the game. Rumble saw them clearing a ward, but ran closer for no reason and Jarvan initiated. Rumble was caught out and MRN easily won the resulting teamfight, and then ended the game. 


*

**Short Summary:** TSM outplayed MRN in a teamfight, but they were too far behind to win it, giving MRN an inhibitor. MRN then caught Rumble and ended the game.
______________________________________________________________________________________________
**V. Key Points**

A brief list of the mistakes from above to improve on from this game:

***TSM***

* **Ability Use** - Untimely use of Rumble's skills led to a missed gank and a death. 

* **Positioning** - Xerath's overaggressive spell use often resulted in bad positioning. Xerath has long range, a linear damage spell, and long cast times, and he must be played with that in mind. 

* **Mid Game Map Control** - Poor map control constricted TSM. This is more about opportunity cost than any direct disadvantages.

* **Reaction** - Poor reaction to baron cost them the game. This has not been a repeated problem in the past for TSM and is unlikely to be in the future, but it was such a huge mistake this game that it's worth mentioning.

***MRN***

* **Aggression** - Akali's overaggression toward Rumble led to successful ganks.

* **Team Positioning** - Grouping up before the dragon fight allowed Xerath to chunk them. Split positioning before the fight bottom lane meant they could not react immediately when TSM engaged on them, despite being ahead.

______________________________________________________________________________________________
**VI. Final Thoughts**

For me, the most important part of this analysis is my observations in Event Series 12. I had been noticing TSM's poor mid game map control and I wanted to get an in depth grasp on it, or to see if it was all just in my head. Looking at the game, I think my initial insights were correct. TSM's problem seems to come up when they are behind to some extent, and more importantly, the enemy team exerts some map control. They seem to respond to this by turtling and dropping very few wards, none of which are remotely aggressive. 

While it is not always safe to ward, they tend to turtle even when it's clear the enemy team is not exerting pressure, missing opportunities to regain control. They'll often stick to farming their lanes and small jungle creeps, and if the enemy is pushing a lane on their side of the map, they'll stand around waiting for it to push back to them, even when it should be clear the enemy team is not looking to 5 man push. This allows the enemy team to take their time and move freely around the map, forcing TSM into a purely reactive role. 

Even when it doesn't lead to any direct disadvantages, there is an opportunity cost to being so passive. I also think that the turtling mindset had indirect effects in this game, causing TSM to react poorly to the baron in this game, even though their passive wards still gave them enough vision. This poor mid game approach also played a part in the near upset of the W4D2 game vs VUL (though after reviewing the game, the effect was far less than I initially thought) as well as the W1D1 game vs CLG, and in games extending back since last summer. TSM typically is able to exert strong map control when they are ahead, but falter when behind.

*

Another interesting trend I've noticed was MRN's passive early game play. This has been the status quo for MRN since W3, which is in stark contrast to their early game play in W2. Their openings have always been passive, guarding the four entrances and warding their own side of the map. However, MRN previously had an overly aggressive lane phase, attempting to gank without regarding the possibility of enemy wards, which caused them to be countered and allowed the enemy team to snowball the advantages from the early game to win easily (For example, see my [analysis on DIG vs MRN](http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/18p7nz/indepth_analysis_na_lcs_w2d1_dig_vs_mrn/)) Clearly, they realized their flaw and have worked to fix it, showing a dramatic shift in focus away from ganking and toward passive jungle farming and laning in W3 and W4. While being so passive is not necessarily the best approach to the early game, it is a definite upgrade over their previous approach. Their shift from W2 to W3 is one of the most dramatic changes I've seen a team make in a 1 week time span, and I would call them the most improved team over the course of the LCS.",,False,,t5_2wenn,1363119892.0,,,True,t3_1a3mrj,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1a3mrj/in_depth_analysis_a_comprehensive_look_at_the/,

Maybe instead, we should be maxing his heal first now. However, the damage and armor shred from his shatter is still really strong.

So then clearly in a losing lane you'll want the sustain from his heal, and in a winning, aggressive lane you'll want the damage and armor shred, but what about when you can't tell? If you're doing moderately well in lane, but not stomping. Both are very strong skills...

## **Karma Notes**

# **Abilities**

**Ultimate: Mantra (R)**

- Think of it as having 4 ranks
    - Automatically start the game with “rank 1” Mantra.
    - Level-up at lvl 6, 11, and 16 like any other ultimate
- Static 45 second cooldown
    - 27 seconds at max CDR
- Putting points in Mantra increases the potency of the Mantra’d abilities.
    - Ex: The bonus damage from Mantra’d Q (**Soulflare**) scales with points in **Manta** (R)


**Passive: Gathering Fire**

- Reduces mantra cooldown when you damage an enemy champion with a spell or auto-attack
    - Starts a **1** second
        - automatically increases to **1.5** seconds at **level 7**
        - automatically increases to 2 seconds at **level 13**
    - Half amount for auto-attacks
        - Ex: At level 13, auto-attacks reduce **Mantra**’s cooldown by 1 second (half of 2)
    - Only works on champions
        - Huge drawback to jungle Karma

**Inner Flame / Soulflare (Q)**

- Almost identical to Quinn’s Blinding Assault (Q)
    - 75 less range and slows instead of blinds.
- Good poke ability; useful for triggering **Gathering Fire** (passive) in lane
    - You don’t have to hit the enemy champion; you can hit the minion they are standing next to instead
- **Soulflare** (Manta’d Q) does tons of damage early
    - ~170 damage at lvl 1 with 23 AP
    - The main spell you’ll Mantra throughout majority of the game
    - Slow + considerably large AOE (similar size to Brand’s Pillar of Flame (W)) makes it difficult for the enemy to dodge the damage.

**Focused Resolve / Renewal (W)**

- Does identical damage to **Inner Flame** (Q) and immobilizes the target if they don’t break the tether after 2 seconds
    - Can only target champions
        - Can’t heal off minions with **Renewal**
- Tether range is relatively long: 800 units (?)
    - Often forces a flash out of the enemy if they don’t have a gap closer
    - Weaker against gap closers
- Great for stopping the enemy after they’ve engaged / used their gap closer
    - Great for peeling for your ADC
- Recently changed **Renewal** (Manta’d W) from a flat amount to a percentage of missing health
    - Flat amount was probably too strong in lane but borderline useless late game
    - Makes health a more appealing stat
        - More beneficial to support Karma as she naturally builds health

**Inspire / Defiance (E)**

- Large burst of movement speed for a short duration
    - Feels more like Flash variant than a Ghost variant
- **Defiance** (Mantra’d E) creates huge swings in team fights
    - AOE damage with AOE shield and AOE movement speed increase
    - Main reason why Karma pairs well with divers (Malphite, Zed, Eve, etc.)
        - The more divers the better
- **Soulflare** (Mantra’d Q) still does more damage and provides massive AOE slow
    - Probably want to **Manta** E in teamfights where you have a lot of divers, otherwise, **Mantra** Q might be better

*****

#**Mid**
- Similar to **Orianna**
    - Both champions tend to come out ahead in trades in lane
    - Both champions provide a lot of utility and control in team fights
    - Both champions have shields, slows, movement speed boosts, and like to auto-attack when available

- In a lot of areas, **Karma** zigs where **Orianna** may zag but they ultimately accomplish similar things
    - **Karma** is more straightforward to play and more forgiving when you make a mistake
        - No ball, short cooldown on ultimate

- **Orianna** farms slightly better
    - Can shove the lane faster due to line skillshot
        - More wraiths

- **Karma**’s ganks are better, especially pre-6
    - Other lanes as well as her own (when your jungler ganks)

- **Karma** vs **Orianna** (damage)
    - Damage is very similar across the board when you consider practical spell rotations. **Karma** starts to do more damage late game, provided she is able to get two or more Mantra casts

- **Karma** vs **Orianna** (mana)
    - **Karma** uses significantly less mana early and mid-game due to less spell casts and the fact **Mantra** has no mana cost

- **Orianna** probably pairs better with other AOE champions due to the displacement that her ultimate provides

#**Support**
- Feels like **Lulu**
    - Like Lulu, **Karma** wants to level her Q (**Inner Flame**), a skillshot that slows and does considerably good damage
        - You can opt to level E instead if you need to play passively

    - Doesn’t push the lane quite as fast as Lulu but is similar
        - Circle AOE spell instead of line skillshot

    - Can all-in with more damage due to **Mantra**
        - Landing a Mantra’d Q (**Soulflare**) on both enemies heavily tilts the lane in your favor, especially against non-sustain lanes

    - Teamfight is incredibly similar
        - Likes all-in backline dive buddies (Malphite, Zed, Olaf, Kha’Zix, Lee Sin, Evelynn etc) due potency of Manta’d shield (**Defiance**)
            - The more divers the better. **Defiance**’s shield and movement speed boost are *AOE* team buffs
        - Can simulate a miniature Lulu ultimate: Shield + Shard of True Ice

    - Karma can peel for the ADC better than Lulu
        - Both have shields, slows, cc, and movement speed boosts
            - Karma's E provides a massive burst of movement speed that is arguebly better for escaping in fights.
            - Lulu has to choose between polymorph (cc) and movement speed; can't have both
            - Karma can chain abilities: slow, immobilize, slow, to create a large peel buffer for her ADC
            - Wild Growth balances this out but ideally should be used offensively (not on the ADC) to get the most out of the AOE knock-up and AOE slow

*****

#**Builds**
- Cooldown is for sure the major core stat
    - Increases ability to poke
    - More spell casts in a team fight
    - Multiple Mantra casts during lane or - once you hit late game - multiple Mantra casts in a single team fight
        - 27 second cooldown on Mantra at max CDR

    - **Mid**:  should build 1 major CDR item (15%+ CDR) and get the rest from blue buff
        - Morello’s, Athene’s, etc.
    - **Support**: Lots of options
        - Locket, CDR boots, Shurelya’s, Morello’s, Athene’s, etc. + masteries

- After that, you have a lot of room to build whatever you want (huge plus). You should always build dynamically based on the enemy team.
    - Raw **Ability Power** is good, though, as it increases the potency of all your abilities (including shield amount)
    - Doesn’t suffer from “Zac disease;” itemization is in her favor. **Karma** benefits in some way from almost every stat

*****

#**Final Thoughts**

- Similar to **Orianna** when played **Mid**
    - Dominant in lane and provides utility and control in team fights
    - But Orianna is better at being Orianna. Her ultimate is game changing. Why play Karma?
        - Karma is more straightforward, easier to play, and more forgiving
            - Not just solo queue. I mean for competitive players as well
                - Not everybody can be TPA|Toyz

- Similar to **Lulu** when played as a **Support**
    - Doesn’t fast push as well so Lulu is a better fit to someone like Caitlyn
    - **Wild Growth**, Lulu’s ultimate, is a bit better than Karma’s **Defiance** (Manta’d E), especially in situations where you have a single backline diver. However, **Defiance**’s shield is AOE so it’s better with multiple backline divers and the cooldown is much, much lower.

- Can be played **top** lane
    - Hard to gank Karma due to her ability to kite and prevent / offset damage
    - Large variety of items are viable, including tanky items
    - Might have mana issues due to lack of blue buff
        - Chalice of Harmony should solve any mana issue. Look to pick it against magic-based champions as Chalice also has magic resist

- Can be played **jungle**
    - Leash is mandatory (srsly you’ll die)
    - Passive (**Gathering Fire**) doesn’t proc on jungle monsters (con)
    - Ganks are strong
        - Slow, immobilize, speed boost, 45s ultimate
        - Can apply red buff from range (525)

- Can be played as a [fringe] **attack damage carry** variant
    - Passive (**Gathering Fire**) synergizes with Hurricane
        - Max CDR + 2 attacks a second against 3 targets = 5s cooldown on Mantra
    - Nashor’s Tooth is an efficient source of cooldown reduction, ability power, and attack speed

- Incredibly versatile, especially for **3150** IP
    - Orianna (4800 IP) subsitute
    - Lulu (6300 IP) subsitute
    - Could be viable in other roles (top and jungle, most notably)

*****

**tl;dr**: **Mid-lane**, Karma ultimately fills a role similar to **Orianna**. However, she handles differently, is more straightforward, and more forgiving.

As a **support**, Karma plays similar to **Lulu**. They both thrive in team compositions that like to fast push and dive the backlines with all-in champions. Lulu fast pushes better while Karma is better at peeling for the ADC.

At 3150 IP, Karma is a power buy and **you should pick her up**.",,False,,t5_2wenn,1364737640.0,,,True,t3_1bbs4d,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1bbs4d/karma_breakdown_more_than_a_spotlight/,

1361948922.0,42,self.summoners,19bdd2,I've done some calculations on new BotRK (the PBE version),44,2,68,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/19bdd2/ive_done_some_calculations_on_new_botrk_the_pbe/,"I've got interested in the new BotRK [by this tread](http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/198b2s/a_somewhat_indepth_look_on_quinn_new_botrk_and/c8lynnz) and I had nothing better to do at work so I've written a [python script](https://gist.github.com/anonymous/5048172) to plot some DPS graphs.

It only accounts for basic things such as Crit chance, crit multiplier, armor pen, armor, HP, % HP damage and AS, it doesn't include advanced damage reduction (like block, ninja tabi, 3% reduction mastery, etc. but since those are % based, and block is not really significant at the level I'm doing the DPS tests it should be enough).

Anyway I wanted to see how new BotRK with 30 AD and 40 AS and 5% of current HP compares in DPS to the alternatives, and how it scales with other items.

How to read graphs : The first graph is avarage DPS graph, the second graph is a trial run where RNG is used to determine if AA will crit or not based on crit chance and dot marks auto-attack, triangle marks a critical hit, all graphs represent champion HP on Y axis and time spent auto-attacking on X.

Lvl 11 cait stats with 1 item and zerkers vs a champion that has :

* [1300 HP 50 armor](http://imgur.com/bnL7rtv), [trial run](http://imgur.com/eBegLNP)  
* [2200 HP 100 armor](http://imgur.com/GpZiCrd), [trial run](http://imgur.com/oRvKbtO)  

Supprisingly (?) BotRK is the best DPS item for both cases (where BT is better than live BotRK on squishy target and IE is very close to PBE BotRK, ofc it's relying on RNG so it's not going to be consistent)

Lvl 11 cait with ~8k gold worth of items vs a champion that has :

* [1500 HP 60 armor](http://imgur.com/MYW1gAE), [trial run](http://imgur.com/EYHq6Ur)   
* [2500 HP 120 armor](http://imgur.com/1lcB3VO), [trial run](http://imgur.com/dG10u7D)   

The BotRK+LW+BF sword combo (that costs ~ IE/PD combo) is actually equally effective at killing the squishy champion as the IE/PD (slightly slower) but it's the most efficient DPS item on the tanky champion, and it doesn't rely on RNG/Crits for DPS

lvl 18 cait with full build vs a champion that has :

* [1800 HP 80 armor](http://imgur.com/ZG7LhLc), [trial run](http://imgur.com/K3uJU1R)  
* [2500 HP 120 armor](http://imgur.com/dlQAbQX), [trial run](http://imgur.com/yqVpmsP)  
* [3500 HP 200 armor](http://imgur.com/hxLzxg1), [trial run](http://imgur.com/XV45mA0)  

Anyway these comparisons are just the DPS numbers, none of this includes AD scaling abilities (which go in favor of BT/IE) and it also doesn't account for sustain or the utility from the active, but I feel that for auto-attacking AD carries BotRK if it comes out in it's current form, will be a core item, and it will merge two slots in to one - it gives sustain and attack speed and some AD, and it leaves you with the option to fill the missing AD/crit on your own, my idea is Atma's + Mallet, but who knows maybe PD will be better for MS/passive/extra AS for on hit effects.

If someone feels like going trough the script and checking if I messed something up feel free to tell me, I did this on the job so I don't have time to double check it, you can also modify the script if you feel like playing with numbers, it's python code and it uses matplotlib to plot graphs.

**Conclusion**

Early game, BotRK is the best item to rush on auto attacking champions. From DPS perspective, it will have almost as good DPS as infinity edge on squishy targets and better DPS on higher HP targets while being 1k gold cheaper and giving you 15% lifesteal and attack speed (for on-hit effects) and the active.

Mid game you can go for BotRK + IE, it will outperform IE + PD which is a pure damage option with no sustain, it will be slightly weaker on a squishy but stronger on a tanky champion. Also BotRK + LW + BF sword is almost as good DPS source, it will be weaker on a squishy but stronger on high armor - high HP and it doesn't rely on crits so it has consistent damage (and with 25% crit from IE it's perfectly possible not to crit for a long time, so BotRK + LW + BF sword is more reliable DPS).

Late game BotRK + LW + IE + PD is the highest DPS combo, it's better than standard IE + PD + BT + LW. Getting Atma's + Frozen Mallet is actually better with BotRK + LW + IE than just getting a blood thirster because the 15% crit from Atma's is better than 35 AD difference you get from fully stacked BT, but PD is still better in terms of pure DPS. I've also done a test with 0.2 and 0.4 AS reduction and BotRK + PD + BT + PD is still the best DPS combo, the standard ADC combo (IE+PD+LW+BT) beats it just slightly on squishy target but loses on tanks.

EDIT: I've updated the lvl18 graphs because I accidentally calculated the non-botrk build with %HP damage that it doesn't have, I've also added another build combo

EDIT 2: I've updated the graphs to show the avarage DPS along with a trial run DPS graphs I originally had, these are much more reliable in terms of comparing DPS on avg. [Thank you /u/Vilnore for doing this patch](https://gist.github.com/anonymous/5051022)

Hi all! After seeing some of the fan reactions to the results of some of the Allstars games, I felt like now was the time to bring up something I'd been thinking about regarding casting in League of Legends.

Something important to consider in watching League of Legends Esports is that while the results of games speak for themselves, the casters are the lens through which very many people observe the game. Thats to say, casters can have a pretty big impact on how people think someone played or how well a team worked together.

I light of this, I'd like to draw attention to the different ways a caster can frame an event, so that an audience member draws different conclusions. Lets look at a very straight forward event that took place this weekend, LPL stealing baron from NALCS. There are a number of ways this could be presented to the audience, but I want to look at two in particular.

1. ""StVicious fails to smite the baron properly""
2. ""Troll/ClearLove manages to pull off the steal""

At their core, both of these present the same information about the state of the game, but their connotations are vastly different. Sentence 1 presents the game state as a result of some perceived lack of skill on StVicious' part. This can lead to fan frustration and the issue of player harassment we've seen recently. It implies that StVicious was the sole cause of the event at hand, and can focus the criticism of the internet like a laser.

Sentence 2, however, phrases the event as an achievement of Troll. Instead of focusing on the negative aspect for one team, it focuses on the positive aspect for the other. This is how people build a fanbase, they get caster hype, their skill is recognized on the world stage, and builds an appreciation for such skill amongst the viewers.

With league being a zero-sum game (essentially, one team winning or doing well implies the other team losing or doing badly), this technique can be applied to pretty much any event in a game. Doublelift facechecked a bush? No, TSM set up an ambush that succeeded. YellowPete got initiated on? No, StVicious landed a perfect flash hook for his team. Dyrus dies 2v1 to PDD? No, PDD perfectly knows his damage to turn an adverse scenario. 

This suggestion isn't directed at any caster in particular, I just view it as a logical way to improve. By focusing on the successes of a team and the positive aspects of an event, I feel casting can be brought to the next level.

Thanks so much guys, I'd love to hear what you have to say.

Also, you guys like thought provoking banter, so woot!

Ok, folks. *Hear me out*.

This isn't a call out or a witch hunt. I am truly curious about this subject, and since there hasn't been anything at all regarding substance use in eSports or LoL I wanted to gauge the public's opinion on the matter.  

Clearly there are stringent rules regarding performance enhancers in physical sports, so why would it be any different in the digital arena? As long as there is competition, man will try to get an edge over their opponent. What stops LoL e-thletes from gaining that edge from Rx?

Now, I'm not saying the majority of those involved in the professional LoL scene or even other games are constantly hopped up on amphetamines or otherwise. However, I have noticed a few things that have led me to believe strongly that there are some that do. The most blatant sign comes from players during their post game interviews. Despite being under intense lighting, their eyes appear completely dilated. Without the help of psychoactive/dilating substances, this feat is almost impossible.

Anyway, I digress. I want to know what you think, r/Summoners -- and esport athletes/Rioters for that matter. What's your stance on performance enhancers in the pro scene? Are there rules in place against these drugs? Do you think there should be? Is it unfair for those who are prescribed these drugs to compete?

I don't know how Riot will arrange the voting, but I feel that the best way to do it would be if they forced you to vote on each position, and not just allow you to vote for a single position. 

I don't think a team made up exclusively of strong players will necessarily do well. If there are any soccer fans out there, you might be familiar with the played Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard. They are top level players in England, but famously perform poorly on the same team. They just can't seem to make things work. I have a feeling that an NA all star team made up purely of stars would be like this.

## **[C9 vs CST](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4IPNtTnGSY)** - Full Game + Pick/Ban phase.

**SPOILERS BELLOW**

* **

^.

Now when someone mentiones Vayne, the immidiate thought that goes into the majority of people's heads is Doublelift. Apperantly, to the casters, as well, Vayne was associated as a champ that fits split-push skirmish late-game teams. From our experience with Cloud 9, they don't seem to fit the criteria for a possible Vayne pick. That's wrong; and here's why:

^.

* **


## Team Playstyle:

Cloud 9 have this unorthodox (for the NA scene) style of play where they distribute the gold to their team evenly, as shown in multiple games and charts. This means that the solo laners and the ADC get less average gold, while the jungle and support have more.

While this seems counter-intuitive to the whole Vayne pick, it actually **Suits her better**. Vayne is designed to be a champion which over the course of multiple attacks deals very high damage. Much like all AD carries. Vayne however benefits the MOST off of being able to output **Undisturbed** DPS.

Due to the gold being distributed trough the entire team, not only is C9 losing all the damage they bring to their team fight if Sneaky Dies, but also that takes off pressure from Sneaky since he won't be focused completely and is allowed to do consistent undisturbed DPS.

* ^^^^^.  Vayne was allowed to DPS undisturbed due to her team being just as strong!



* **

## Team Comp:

As touched in the previous paragraph, Vayne strives to be undisturbed. This means that all sorts of peels and disables on the team greatly increase her effective DPS.

The team C9 ran had multiple disables on all of their champions and a very sizable Tank-line (With Lemon, Meteos and Quasi-tank Balls). Also they supplied multiple threats with Balls and Hai that alleviated pressure off Sneaky.

Reaching Vayne is especially hard in that team comp. For one, the multitude of disables and peels from Meteos, Lemon and Sneaky himself (Vayne is pretty slippery) kept him very safe. The only way Coast could penetrate that is if they focus Zion, Shiptur and Nintendude on killing Vayne. This brings me to my second point, C9 had enough damage on their own with Kennen, Elise and the farmed Nasus to teamfight once Coast had spent everything on going trough their peel.



* ^^^^^. Vayne was provided with Peel and the team had multiple threats!

* **

## Zed:

Vayne does very good against Zed. This is (as explained in the post-game interview) their main rationale behind picking the Vayne and is a very Valid one. Zed strives to split-push and duel anyone who offsets his split push. This strategy is often thwarted trough either hard engage (4v5) or Duelists.

This means C9 had the option of either going full on engage (with an Ashe) or getting a duelist like Vayne that can kill a Zed 1on1. The Ashe pick couldn't happen since they didn't have the AoE to dive whenever they please (much like the C9 vs Ves game) and that meant Coast could just stall for the Zed split push. This was effectively countered with the Vayne pick.

And not only Zed does bad vs Vayne. Both Zac and Renekton wane to her percentage-based true damage and Ezreal really can't do anything to a Vayne unless marginally ahead. That smart pick and ban phase that Lemon coordinated fell in place completely with the Vayne pick.



* ^^^^^. Zed and most of Coasts' comp does bad vs Vayne!

* **

## But Vayne should get all the gold! :

This is one misconception that people have within the community. While it's true that Sneaky doesn't wander off (Read: Split push) alone to bulk up his cs at the expense of losing pressure, the idea that he gets less gold than other teams is blatantly false. Infact, what Sneaky and his team does is actually capitolize on this mistake that other LCS teams do by sending the AD to get objectives along with the rest of their team. This gives Sneaky almost as much gold and experience as the rest of the teams' ADCs while also giving him a resource not many other teams have that much off: Map presence. Map presence is essential to using an ADC effectively. As seen in most of the mid-game fights, C9 were actually the ones that initiated the fights. This meant that diving Vayne was tremendously more difficult and that gave Sneaky breathing room to do more damage most ADCs.



* ^^^^^. Sneaky got more gold trough objectives and had map pressure!

* **

## Playing the strong champions:

C9 have said on multiple occasions that their champion pool is effectively made up only of champions that are strong at the current moment. Due to recent events Vayne has had most of her counters in lane nerfed, while also benefits greatly off the 1v2 lanes that are played. Additionally her synergy with Botrk and both Zeal items make her one of the top ADCs available at the moment (as seen in her recent soloQ popularity).




* ^^^^^. Vayne is Strong right now! C9 pick and practise what is strong!

* **

## TL;DR

**Cloud 9 orchastrated a beautiful pick trough proper knowledge of the meta-game. The Vayne pick was justified with proper gameplay, counter-picking and perfect understanding of the Team's Playstyle and limits.**",,False,,t5_2wenn,1374827708.0,,Quinn,True,t3_1j2p3t,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1j2p3t/why_sneaky_was_allowed_to_pick_vayne_c9_vs_coast/,

**Analysis:**

###[[Images]Teamfight Breakdown &amp; Analysis](http://imgur.com/a/1EEoe#0)

The overarching theme in this teamfight is DIG's inability to play against split positioning, even though the split actually put GGU at a positional disadvantage.

**Key Factors:**

* **Twisted Fate positioned poorly against GGU's split.** This led to TF getting caught out of position 3 separate times by the GGU players in the dragon pit. TF needed to ensure DIG had a proper tank line set up before moving closer to the pit.

* **DIG did not exercise choke point control.** This prevented DIG from maintaining the split and using it to their advantage. Instead, by chasing into the pit, Riven was able to bypass the DIG tanks and establish choke point control for GGU.

* **DIG did not maintain their tank lines against both fronts.** Instead, the tank line focused on just 1 of the GGU groups, leaving their flank open, which GGU took full advantage of.

Though this analysis is focused on DIG, I would like to emphasize the excellent transitioning by GGU, continuously adapting their positioning throughout the teamfight to suit the situation.

**Key Factors:**

* **Zac failed to recognize GGU's positional advantage.** Though it was just for a second, DIG was greatly punished for Zac's momentary overaggression into GGU's concave.

* **DIG's back line clumped up.** Their singular focus onto Karthus caused the clump, which allowed Ezreal to easily hit 4 members with his ult. It also allowed Blitzcrank to single-handedly zone the DIG back line.

* **DIG failed to respect GGU's zoning.** This split Draven from his team and let GGU get an extra kill on TF.

###III. Teamfight 3 [33:48-34:05]

**Analysis:**

###[[Images]Teamfight Breakdown &amp; Analysis](http://imgur.com/a/lXfcV#0)

**Key Factors:**

* **DIG failed to recognize that GGU had the situational advantage, despite popping Riven's GA.** With their cooldowns spent on Riven, GGU easily kited and out traded DIG's feeble engage attempt, which left DIG in a vulnerable position as Riven respawned. Their focus should have solely been on bursting Riven as she revived.

___
###IV. Conclusions From Game 1

In these 3 teamfights, DIG's mistakes stem from their extremely simplistic and rigid approach, in which they seem only able to operate in 2 modes: engage and retreat. When engaging, they exhibit an all-in mentality, setting their sights onto their target and rushing toward it. This singular focus creates flaws in their positioning, which GGU exploited very effectively, and causes them to miss opportunities because they require things like zoning, which do not involve direct attack. When they aren't all-in engaging, it is simply because they are forced to retreat.

*

This is by far the biggest underlying problem with DIG's teamfighting in this game, which is very apparent in all 3 fights:

The first teamfight can be described thusly: (1) Zac's good initiation splits GGU, (2) DIG singularly focuses onto the GGU members outside the pit, (3) DIG retreats as TF is caught at the unguarded flank, (4) DIG singularly refocuses onto the GGU members inside the pit, (4) DIG retreats as GGU splits DIG at the unguarded flank.

The second teamfight is similar: (1) Zac's initiation splits off Karthus, (2) DIG singularly focuses onto Karthus, (3) DIG retreats as GGU punished Zac's overextension.

The third teamfight: (1) The DIG initiation splits off Riven, (2) DIG singularly focuses onto Riven and pop her GA, (3) DIG turn their all-in focus onto the rest of GGU, (4) DIG retreats as Riven revives and catches them out of position.

If we analyze the teamfights starting at the point in which DIG engages, DIG should have been able to come out ahead in each instance.  with proper zone control and situational awareness. Instead, their poor approach squandered their opportunity to capitalize off the advantageous engages and allowed GGU to turn the teamfight on them.

*

However, this is just 1 game. We will examine if this pattern holds up in part 2, as we study the teamfights in the second game of the series.",,False,,t5_2wenn,False,,,True,t3_1e467n,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1e467n/dignitas_teamfighting_analysis_part_1/,

**Why split from /r/leagueoflegends?**

* **NOTHING IS BEING CHANGED ABOUT RULESETS ON /r/leagueoflegends.** This is just a subreddit focused on QUALITY and CONTENT. It's a project Alex Penn had the idea for so I ran with it and made the subreddit because I know how reddit works.
* This subreddit will be more heavily focused on news, eSports, and discussion content versus community driven content, requests, and videos.
* /r/leagueoflegends is focused on community aspects of League of Legends and filters as little content as possible, this subreddit will be focused solely on news and content related to League.
* Neutral ground is a requirement for a news/content aggregate and Reddit provides this feature while providing all the necessary infrastructure. A subreddit is the perfect neutral area where everyone can be equal. 
* Having a filtered subreddit focused on League and League eSports will advance the scene in a positive direction.
* The freedom and ability to make changes necessary to facilitate and drive the community in a better direction. (Verification system, very clearly defined rules, amazing looking flair, etc)

----

**Goals of /r/Summoners:**

* Become an information and discussion hub of  League of Legends information and content. 
* Keep /r/summoners as ""fluff free"" as possible.  
* Facilitate and grow new ways for content producers to get legitimate feedback and opinion driven discussion
* Drive for quality over quantity.
* Fair rules, fair moderating, and transparency.

**What's in the future?**

* I'll be adding more mods, the current mods are here to help with CSS/Flair. 
* Working on clarifying any grey areas in the rulesets, also looking into exactly what we would like flair to accompish (twitter tags, riot flair, etc).
* Listening to community input on what needs to be changed and making changes.
* Since this is an upstart community which will hopefully flourish throughout the month, be sure to tell your friends if they are interested in a consolidating, focused aggregate to subscribe!

Above vod is from the lpl match this morning between OMG and WE. Maybe you will get an first impression what OMG brought to this game. 

**Intro:**

The current line up formed September 2012. The OMG the organization formed earlier.  Gogoing/san/cool are the 3 initial members during the September reform, Palemo was a pro player before that also.  Only lovelin was new as a pro back then.  

**Style:**

The OMG style, combined 3 key elements:

* Vision Focus, OMG has bought the most wards from lv1 till every stage of the game in LPL. usually have at least 5 sight wards, 1 vision ward and 1 mastery ward at lv1 amount the whole team. They also have Oracle up whole game starting as early as 5-7 minutes by jungler and follow by the support. Usually support will have 2-3 sight ward + ruby sightstone + oracle up throughout the mid - late game along with others getting some more. Vision control has created a lot room for tactical play, for example, the lv1 top bush ward in the above vod against WE. 

* Strong Lane Phase. Laning period is very key time for OMG because they often gain enough advantage during this stage. No matter 1v2 switch or common 1 1 2 approach, OMG always has solid lane phase and never fall behind in every lane compare to opponent. A strong lane phase is not an easy task to maintain every game, it required many factors include the correct lane focus by jungler, individual mechanic, vision control and perfect calculation of trade/skill timer. For example: The Whole OMG team will keep check every single Flash/cleanse/ghost used by opponent and type down the timer and use it as an advantage if available. 

* Objective focus. Similar to many Korean teams, OMG's no.1 focus is Objective. They often create chance by either pushing opponent key champion (jungle/adc/solo lane) away from the objectives or gank/bait and group up as soon as it happens to pick up the objective. Because the vision control, they often has upper hand in knowing where are opponent units locate around the map and able to move towards the right target/objective in short time. 

**Strength/Advantage:**

All 5 players in OMG line up are former top 3 rating in Chinese Solo Q ranking. They still have 4 of them in the top 15 and 2 of them in top 5 now. The only member that is outside top 100 is OMGsan but he does not play solo q anymore after reach Rank 1 back then. The understanding of the game and mechanic skills of this OMG team are amount the best few teams in China. They still have the highest average solo q rating in LPL (IG and WE has many members play in KR server instead)

Work rate. OMG is considered the best team in China to perform a setup plan from lv1 till end of the game. From the above Vod you can see they play the whole game just like a machine. 

Snowballing. OMG is known to be a team that hardly or never throw away any early game advantage. Their ability to keep snowballing the game is very impressing and often a nightmare to opponents which like to make mistake somewhere early in the game (like IG). 

**Weakness/Disadvantage:**

Team fight. Still a very young team, OMG's teamfight is not comparable to teams like WE/IG yet. They are still very high level in this field but not the world class we are looking at. Which you can see in the above vod that WE able to pull out some solid teamfight even down on economic by a huge amount. 

Come Back. OMG still has alot to improve in playing games from behind. Because of their style they often win in early game which also means they lack experience and knowledge how to play in games that they are not winning or losing. 


**Members:**

*Support:*

**OMGlovelin**

*Prefer picks:* 

Thresh / Lulu / Sona / Zyra 

Lovelin is the most important member of this OMG team. As a support, his vision control is the root and core element in the OMG playing style. Considered as the best mechanic support in China now, his understanding of ""what is best for this situation"" and talents in skill timer/targeting during teamfights often result match-deciding teamfight wins. Also the highest Rating support in the LPL MVP chart, hes getting more and more recognition now and pulls target ban on his thresh almost every game. 

*Facts:*

* He use 1 13 16 Masteries, Flat AD Marks, Armor Seals, MR Glyphs and GP10 Quints on thresh/sona/lulu. he may use different marks on Zyra, most likely Mpen. 

* His lv1 item always is Mastery item pair (cookie and ward) + 4 sight wards + 1 vision ward + 2 red pot. 

* Hes support style is very traditional Chinese style, He will not purchase too many ""real"" item but always keep Oracle and at least 4-5 wards (sightstone as 3) up on inventory. He choose to build only Shurelya outside the tier 2 boots/ruby sightstone. 

* His laning mechanic, the dual harass move together with OMGsan, often result better trades. For Example: Sona with Cait, both will stay far away from each but in range of Sona's heal. they will move towards enemies and harass with skill/autos on different target at the same time and move back at the same time with a sona heal. because Sona's heal able to sustain both unit, they wins the trade by out sustain opponent. Also his Zyra ulti combo with san's MF ulti also a terror to face. 

* During his solo q times, he and Clearlove were labeled by the China scene as the 2 best playmakers in game. 

*AD Carry:*

**OMGsan:**

*prefer picks:*

Caitlyn / Graves / MF / Varus

San, which means Umbrella in English, is a talented Ad carry player just as good as Weixiao and Uzi. He made his name in solo q climbing as he was asked to switch server in order to become a pro player and he manage to climb up all the way to the Rank 1 playing adc with not many games. San's adc style suits the OMG team very well as he often put himself at very safe position, which allow other member of the team to have room either to dive or protect him. His teamwork with lovelin often consider one of the best in China, maybe next to Wx/Fzzf. 

*Facts:*

* He does not play solo q on his acc for a long time but it still remain at rank 113. but still very far from the rest of the team (but weixiao's rating in china server is only 2100 which is not even top 500). 

* Hes one of the rare top class adc in China that main graves in current meta. 

*Jungle:*

**OMGbigpalemo**

*prefer picks:*

Volibear / J4 / Vi / Noc 

Bigpalemo, or Youzi in Chinese, is the former teammate with WE.Clearlove and WE.Fzzf in team Phoenix before join OMG. Despite the huge reputation of clearlove in the jungle, It was Palemo who play as jungle in that team (CL is a mid player). With very similar playing style and skill level, Palemo like to make plays just as much as CL. His 2 go to champion, Voli and J4, both are playmaker type of jungler and he often pick up both aura items (locket/bulwark) because Lovelin the support hardly build any real item beside vision related. 

*Fact:*

* hes the 1st ever player in the world to play Sejuani in competitive play, back in week 3 of LPL against IG. And he won the game with some insane initial of sejuani ulti to set up the zyra/mf ulti combo. He also played Pantheon in another game against WE to combo with the Shen shield man drop. 

* hes one of the best junglers in China to be able to survive with heavy set backs. In his game with Sejuani against IG, he had 0 buff at first circle and still manage to farm up and actually got richer than illusion the counter part. 

* he often just stay around top when come to lane focus. but he wont give up chances available at other lanes. hes not a heavy camper like many others that spend a minute of 2 to make a gank. he often choose to farm up or help to set up visions around the map while Lovelin is stuck in lane. 

*Mid:*

**OMGcool:**

*Prefer Picks:*

Khazix / Diana / Orianna / Karthus / Jayce / Eve

Cool is a very versatile mid laner that able to play most of the meta champions. He often play AD mid because that gogoing like to play ap top (Cool was a former top laner and gogoing actually main Mid before becoming a pro). Cool was also a member of the team that include palemo/clearlove/fzzf. Hes a very stable player, focus on winning the lane and do as much dmg as possible in teamfight rather than roaming alot. He often able to avoid or even counter ganks from jungle effectively and use that as an advantage. Because OMG has a style that fits his gameplay, cool often able to farm well early and safely transit into a great dps at mid game for the team. In the Vod above, he showed hes very capable in carrying also. 

*Facts:*

* Played 7 out of the 17 games as AD mid in LPL. 

* His average cs per game is 270, only behind misaya amoutn all the mid players in LPL. And also has 3rd highest KDA as a mid laner. 

*Top:*

**OMGogoing**

*Prefer pick:*

Rumble / Malphite / Renekton / Shen

Gogoing is a famous solo q player before he joint OMG. He has been to the Rank 1 of solo q in both S2 and S3 before. As a former Mid player, he favour AP top more than ad bruiser, but he has been playing jungle/top since joining OMG, hes also a very strong tank/front line player. Gogoing is consider as good as PDD and Caomei in China and has alot respect from other top laners. 

*Facts:*

* His solo q reputation mostly from his insane mid lane plays. But he has never play mid in pro-level. 

* Hes the only few top laner around that can actually out-lane PDD 1v1. 

* He is considered as the best Malphite in China and perhaps world.

57 Champions have been picked (Zed has been banned but not picked)

**Top champion performances**

* Miss Fortune maintains a 100% Win Rate despite being picked up 5 times.  This is the longest 100% win streak in the EU LCS. She is also rocking the 2nd largest KDA in the league (18.5) Which is why we believe she deserves the title “Champion of the League”

* Renekton 72% win rate across 11 picks, 14th largest KDA (5.4)

* Sona 60% win rate with a massive 20 picks (87% of games) 20th KDA (4.5)

* Katarina has top KDA (26) 2 picks and a 100% win rate  

* Leona has a respectable 4 picks 75% win rate and 5th KDA (7.6)

For Junglers, most have middling stats (Vi, Kayle, Volibear) and have sometimes been played in other lanes, so their jungle stats have not been separated out.  Snoopeh's Maoki is a big standout 2 picks 100% win rate and a 0/0/21 stat line.

**The most desired champions** (Popularity=Picks+Bans/#of Games Available)

* Xin Zhao and Thresh are the only champions with a 100% Popularity in EU LCS

* Shen, Sona, Kayle, Vi, Caitlin, Elise, make up the next big chunk of desirable bans from 87% to 70% Popularity

Of these champions Sona, Kayle, Vi remain above 50% win rate.  Elise and Xin Zhao have the lowest win rates of the “desirable” champions (20% and 33% respectively) and sit pretty low in terms of KDA as well. 

Most Elise bans have come from Gambit Gaming.  Elise has been banned by Gambit Gaming in *every single game they've played.*   This has led to a couple of hypothesis about Elise.  Gambit could be overvaluing Elise, Elise may have just not been picked up by the right players or Elise really messes with Gambits strategy.   

Xin Zhao has been on the losing side of both EG v SK games.  So his highly sought after strength is certainly not game shattering. His league statistics don't really indicate a reason for his 100% popularity, but of course, numbers aren't everything.

**Worst champions performances**

* Zyra has 8 picks, has only won a single game.  Whether Zyra has been unlucky, poorly played, or underpowered, she certainly has had the most underwhelming performance

* Cho' Gath (1 win 5 loses) and Elise (1-4) Are near the bottom

* Graves, Jayce, Nunu, Singed, Wukong all have 0 wins but have only been played in 2 games.  Wukong has impressively managed to be right around the median KDA.

**The least desired champions**

There are about a dozen champions with very very small popularity.  Their win rates are mostly 100% or 0% and either way don't tell you much about the champion.  However, we've highlighted a couple.

* Amumu has been picked once, and earned a win.  Additionally he holds the 3rd Highest KDA. He has been increadibly popular in the past, and I wouldn't surprised to see more of him.

* Nasus is in the same spot as Amumu. 1 pick, 1 win, High KDA.  Diamondprox was the first to jungle volibear, and now the bear has massive popularity.  Will the same thing happen to Nasus?

* Singed has been used to great effect over in the NA LCS.  EU LCS has yet to see a great game out of him in his 2 picks.

* Katarina is unpopular, but she also has had two amazing performances. I wouldn't be surprised to see her popularity increase just by people banning her against Fnatic.

* Irelia this former Queen of top lane has only been picked once (for a loss) and never banned in the EU LCS. 

**Bans**

Most of the bans are relatively uninteresting.  Usually teams have banned champions they know the other team are comfortable playing, or champions they consider very strong.  The following are the most interesting quick facts.  

* EG has been the most successful at making other teams scared of “oddball” picks (anivia, maoki, zed) allowing many perceived “strong picks” get through.

* Kha' Zix received far more bans in the beginning of the season than currently

* GG has banned Elise in every match 

I find it interesting that in the best of 1 format we haven't seen bans to protect a certain composition.  It seems that in this format it may be advantageous to find an odd strategy that you think works well in most situations, and then ban the few champions it may have trouble with.

V. Final Thoughts
___
###I. Introduction

Recently, CLG's LiNk115 [began blogging on an array of topics](http://www.icallmid.com/). Interspersed throughout his posts are several informative remarks on map pressure, an oft-overlooked concept. Here are some excerpts:

&gt;[League is a game of pressure.](http://www.icallmid.com/?p=6) The drafting stage is to help you create a team composition to help pressure the map and win you the game. If you can outpressure the enemy team, you will win the game by overwhelming their base.

&gt;[...] Recently, Caitlyn/Lulu was a heavily picked bottom lane combo [...] By taking a tower, you can completely control the map by controlling where you send Caitlyn/Lulu. Doing so will give your team more gold/exp via taking towers and more map control -&gt; dragons -&gt; more towers -&gt; baron. More gold/exp will most likely help you win a teamfight.

&gt;[To put it simply,](http://www.icallmid.com/?p=8) by winning the tower race, it allows you to move around the map and you get to choose where you want to create pressure. If you can’t take a tower, you are simply a placeholder [...]

&gt;[This happens every time we lose and this easily results into a snowball effect.](http://www.icallmid.com/?p=11) Somebody dies -&gt; they get a tower -&gt; more towers -&gt; map control -&gt; dragon/baron and then well, they win. Another scenario is when somebody dies as we group to pressure the map -&gt; lose momentum/delay our window of going on the offensive -&gt; they catch up -&gt; etc. This is 70% of the reasons why other teams lose too.

Here are the important points to glean from above:

* Pressure is at the core of snowballing advantages.
* Those who fail to apply pressure are idle placeholders.
* Lack of pressure is the main factor in most losses. 

In short, map pressure = important. As you can see from Link's examples, creating pressure is key in taking towers, dragons, barons, and other objectives. Pressure forces enemies to areas of the map, creating openings in which to take advantages. 

However, pressure can also be used defensively. One of the most interesting applications of map pressure is when dictating enemy map movement is not used as a means to an end, but rather, as the end goal itself. When used defensively, pressure is created to threaten a higher priority target, forcing enemies to respond and direct focus away from their original target.

In this analysis, we examine 3 such cases from the OMG vs World Elite semifinals match of the NVIDIA Game Festival 2013. We will study how the use of map pressure, or lack thereof, affected the decisions and movements of each team and caused the outcomes in all 3 examples.

###II. Case 1: [22:11-22:56]

The first case is a fairly straightforward application of the situation from above, using pressure as a defensive mechanism.

###[[Images] Play Breakdown](http://imgur.com/a/jedGQ#0)

**Analysis:**

For whatever reason, OMG put themselves into a disadvantageous situation by starting baron. As WE rushed top lane, OMG was not in position for a direct defense. However, by applying pressure mid, OMG was able to indirectly alleviate the pressure top. The pressure forced WE back to mid lane to defend the higher priority inner turret before they could reach OMG's top turret, cancelling the disadvantage and even allowing OMG to come out ahead in the end with some free damage onto the turret. 

___
###III. Case 2: [20:04-21:26]

A secondary benefit of pressure is that it often spurs teams into making bad decisions. This is not something that should be counted on, as there is no inherent reason requiring teams to make poor judgments, but the fact remains that teams tend to react poorly under pressure.

Case 2, occurring just before the events in case 1, is an example of this; OMG uses pressure for defense, but ends up gaining much more from it. 

###[[Images] Play Breakdown](http://imgur.com/a/08p6w#0)

**Analysis:**

OMG found themselves in a disadvantageous position due to Malphite's teleport and the dragon respawn timer. However, OMG recognized the pressure opportunity mid, allowing them to cancel out the teleport advantage--and more.

OMG also recognized the teleport engage threat, and thus passively applied pressure with the sole intent of forcing Malphite down, making sure to stay out of engagement range. Despite this, the pressure spurred WE into a poor engagement attempt, leading to a relatively straightforward teamfight for OMG, picking up a 2-1 win and the dragon off the back of it.

###IV. Case 3: [33:26-35:53]

In the past couple months, there has been great improvement in the overall awareness and understanding of map pressure in the competitive scene. At the same time, progress in this aspect of the game has always seemed to lag behind other areas, and is still often overlooked.

One explanation for this is that map pressure mistakes lack a direct feedback mechanism. Unlike most mistakes, which result in direct disadvantages, map pressure disadvantages typically deal in terms of opportunity costs and future costs, obscuring the true cost of the mistake. In other words, disadvantages caused by missed pressure opportunities often arise far after the opportunity initially appeared (future costs) and are typically best expressed in terms of foregone advantages rather than direct disadvantages (opportunity costs). 

In case 3, we examine a disadvantage caused by map pressure mistakes, despite occurring well after the opportunities arose.

###[[Images] Play Breakdown](http://imgur.com/a/X4ODK#0)

**Analysis:**

By far the biggest factor that led to WE's baron was OMG's failure to respond to the creep wave pressure bot during their window of opportunity, which allowed Malphite to simultaneously pressure bot lane and baron with teleport. Yet, the effect of this mistake was not fully realized until WE started baron, almost a full 2 minutes after the missed opportunity.

A second missed opportunity occurred as OMG retreated after taking the mid inner turret. Though it would be a risky push, OMG's best move was to apply pressure mid to force Malphite off the bot turret, especially since they had blown his ult earlier. This second mistake occurred almost a minute before WE started baron.

As you can see, the downsides of map pressure mistakes might not be apparent until minutes after the mistake. Furthermore, even if OMG had properly cleared the bot lane, the thought process would not be ""let's clear bot to prevent baron"", but rather ""clear bot to prevent some sort of disadvantage that might come from the creep wave pressure"". This results in a much more nebulous connection between map pressure and disadvantage than, say, the instant negative feedback after getting caught. 

Nonetheless, it is clear map pressure mistakes can have a huge impact on the game, as it did in this case; OMG's failure to recognize pressure opportunities led to an uncontested baron, which can very well be considered the turning point of the game.
___
###V. Final Thoughts

Map pressure is an incredibly pervasive aspect of the game. Even outside of the 3 cases above, there still remain several great examples of map pressure in OMG vs WE. Despite their seeming obscurity, the incredible abundance of map pressure opportunities in every competitive match, and their impact on the game, become very apparent if you look for them.",,False,,t5_2wenn,False,,,True,t3_1exgzz,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1exgzz/indepth_analysis_defensive_applications_of_map/,

I wanted to create a topic for maybe some ideas on how to grow /r/summoners into a bigger subreddit. I understand one of the main attractors of this subreddit is that it is small; however, I think it can serve a greater purpose. Right now the LoL content creation space is very limited. As an independant content producer probably 99% of your views come from lolreddit (or maybe GD or something). The problem with that is lolreddit is that it is very random, and you typically have to cater to a more general audience. I believe that /r/summoners can be a great place for more hardcore content creators, where there is a big enough audience to get a decent discussion, and something that is more consistent than /r/leagueoflegends. 

I believe summoners has already went this direction, with many detailed and hardcore analysis being posted and popular here (my fav: the recent http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1k1vu6/an_analysis_of_lcs_fans_across_the_country_results/) .. and this content did not get popular when posted on lolreddit despite being great. 

so this brings to the point of ""how to bring more people into this community"". Do you guys have any ideas? If we compare with /r/Games  and /r/gaming i believe games gained a big presence through having a message at the top of gaming which said ""for more hardcore info look at /r/Games "" or something. maybe we could try to organize something with the main subreddit ?",,False,,t5_2wenn,False,,,True,t3_1k3xnd,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1k3xnd/ideas_for_growing_summoners_readership/,

HotshotGG (Top)

Chauster (Jungle)

Link (Mid)

Doublelift (AD)

Aphromoo (Support)

**Team Overview:** 

CLG is the name synonymous with League of Legends professional e-sports. Being the longest standing and most recognized team since Season One also comes with increased pressure. CLG placed 4th place in the Fall split of the NA LCS, finishing a disappointing 13-15. After losing 2-1 to Vulcan, CLG awaits an upcoming relegation match. CLG has been widely known for their benching of players, which has recently shown little results in terms of tournament wins. However, the overall raw talent of the team is immense. CLG's strategies have remained standard since it's formation, with the designated ""Hotshot Split-Push"" and ""Protect the Doublelift"" comps. CLG is looking to revive and rebound this summer. Hopefully, the added pressure will allow them to shine.

**Team Strengths:** 

*The Doublelift Show*

CLG's AD Doublelift has always been in the discussion of the best AD carries in North America, if not the world. His in-game mechanics and team fight positioning set him up as the main consistent force behind CLG. The team lives and dies by Doublelift. 

*Quiet Consistency of Link and Aphromoo*

Since the pick-up of the two newest members, Link and Aphromoo, they have molded themselves into the CLG style. Aphromoo is a traditional support playing Lulu and Sona almost exclusively. Since transitioning from AD, he has quietly gained a reputation as one of the top 5 supports in NA. When comparing him to his predecessor, Locodoco, he and Doublelift are now one of the most in-sync bot lanes in LCS, in hopes of rectifying the DL/Chauster bot lane. Throughout the LCS, Link had almost fully adopted playing only Lux and Orianna with an occasional AP Nidalee thrown in. Furthermore, he has one of the largest champion pools of all NA mid laners. In terms of consistency, Link is the backbone of CLG. He leaves the big-plays up to Doublelift and game by game consistently performs his role of support/DPS mid laner. 

**Team Weaknesses**

*Inability to adapt to the meta*

Since Season One, the split-push comp has been CLG's main go to strategy. All their opponents know what they're going to run. It's extremely predictable and boring, almost to a fault. Whether it be CLG's inability to adapt to the new meta or just plain stubbornness, it's holding them back. Aside from a single Karthus top game that went horribly wrong, Hotshot always plays a straight tank, a split pusher, or both. His lack of champion pool always causes targeted bans usually this being Chogath, Malphite, Shen, or Nidalee. 
The one threat, late-game composition CLG has recently ran in LCS is extremely hard to win with in the new meta. The coordination needed to makeup for a lack of damage in teamfights is near impossible to perfect. CLG must adapt to faster tower pushing, objective based games or wins may continue to become a thing of the past.

*Team Communication*

Between HotshotGG, Chauster, and Doublelift arguments it's almost impossible to understand what the team's objective is throughout matches. Last year, even in scrims it was apparent that CLG was plagued by communication flaws. Everyone wanting to get their two cents in isn't a conducive environment to winning games. Miscommunication is apparent in games when Doublelift gets caught face checking a brush, or Hotshot gets ambushed by 3 people. Whether CLG needs one shot caller and leader, or perhaps a devoted team manager to get them back in line, something must be done.

**Team Expectations**

CLG's recent streak of disappointing matches could very well continue if their match against Vulcan is any indication. However, they still possess an immense amount of raw talent and in-game knowledge. If they win the relegation game, they could be well on their way to the top of NA standings again. One more loss, and they're finished as a team. This leaves no room for error or excuses. The added pressure of no longer being a professional gamer, will force CLG to rise to the occasion or crumble under the pressure.",,False,,t5_2wenn,False,,,True,t3_1dx52s,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1dx52s/na_lcs_team_overview_clg_513/,

I know that a while back Elementz used to always get slammed for his tier lists but I decided to make one more along the lines of ""power rankings"". This particular [Tier List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AmxKqVsJqGJ2dGVxaUxKejJIdDN4RDEyNnBqMXJLTWc&amp;usp=sharing) is based completely on statistics (wins and losses).

The beginning stages of this tier list will be rough and champions will change placement on a weekly basis. Just off of the 1st 3 weeks there has been some interesting patterns that have formed and I encourage you to take a look if you're interested in statistics of that nature.

Some of the things that I have noticed...

* NA and EU have about the same size champion pool (NA=57 EU=56) although they did use different champions (68 total).
* Graves, Jayce, and Nunu are the worst so far.
* Miss Fortune, Malphite, Draven, Katarina, Alistar, and Twisted Fate are the best so far
* Malphite and Singed are great picks for NA.
* Miss Fortune is a great pick for EU.
* NA needs to avoid picking Graves, Rumble, Nunu, Jayce, and Anivia.
* EU needs to avoid picking Wukong, Singed, Nunu, Jayce, and Graves.

I will be keeping record of all the matches like this, let me know if you all want me to update you all.

(xpost from /r/LeagueofLegends),44,9,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1iswo8/in_response_to_lemonnation_on_why_na_has_failed/,"[LemonNation's thoughts](http://www.ibuypower.com/blog/2013/07/why-north-america-historically-has-failed-internationally/)

Basically everything he said is true, but it barely scratches the surface.

What he said, in summary, is that Asian teams have always had access to top-level NA/EU games, but until now it's been a one-way street.

This is definitely true, and it's accurate to say that the world-wide meta is becoming more homogenous. Mostly this is because NA/EU teams, especially Cloud 9, have been emulating Korean strategies (and Koreans have taken one or two ideas from NA/EU), and China has opened up to team comps that are designed for more than just beating WE/iG/OMG in the LPL. It's no surprise that Cloud 9's LemonNation has watched all the OGN Spring/Summer games. Even before the LCS Summer split started, they were playing team comps that are common in Korea, and MonteCristo (the analysis caster for OGN games) said that they would win this LCS split because of that... *before the Summer split even started.*

But there are other reasons that NA doesn't do well on a global stage.

First of all, the eSports scene in Korea (and to a lesser extent China... I'll be focusing on Korea since they are the strongest region right now) has a huge history. Many of the top Korean teams are ""KeSPA teams"". KeSPA is a company that helps Korean eSports players get into teams and get sponsors. KeSPA has teams in both NLB and OGN (Korean amateur and pro-level, respectively) and they take very good care of their teams. The president of KeSPA is a Korean senator, by the way... that's how big eSports is in Korea.

NA has *at least* a few years before their infrastructure can reach the level that Korea has right now. Any Korean team that has a sponsor also has a coach and an analyst working for them (often more than one). Remember when Dyrus said, about the NA all-stars team, that having an analyst is like having another teammate? Well, every pro team in Korea has that and more.

**And there's even more reasons...**

Asian teams (again, mostly Korean teams, because their infrastructure is so well supported) get better practice. The main reason for this is that most Korean sponsors have more than one pro team. For instance, TSM and Curse can scrim together if they want, but they won't be able to practice their secret strategies. Blaze and Frost don't care about that problem nearly as much, because they have the same sponsor.

And even if you ignore the advantage of ""sister teams"", you'll notice that OGN teams get to scrim against NLB teams. NLB teams are very, very strong. Honestly, most NLB teams would probably do better in the NA/EU LCS than most NA/EU LCS teams. This is partially because Korea is a stronger region, due to their financial support, and also because there's less of a skill gap between NLB--&gt;OGN than there is between the amateur NA/EU teams and the LCS teams in NA/EU.

To put it in perspective... remember Najin Sword from S2 WCS? They're in NLB now. Granted, Maknoon left the team before they fell into NLB, but he joined KT Rolster A(rrows), ~~which is now also an NLB team.~~ Apparently they haven't qualified for NLB, my mistake.

Don't get me wrong, I would *love* to see a North American team (or even a European team for that matter, even though I live in California) win the S3 WCS. I think that with more coaches and analysts, and a better infrastructure, and the *huge* amount of money that supports Korean players... NA/EU teams would be very competitive worldwide. But I don't see that happening in time for the world finals.

**TL;DR**: LemonNation was right, but there's more to it than that. NA/EU players are very good but these regions don't have the infrastructure to compete with Korea or China. Less money + less coaches and analysts + having to scrim against worse teams (because of a lesser infrastructure supporting the amateur teams that they scrim against) = NA/EU has a *very* slim chance of winning S3 WCS.

But don't give up. Support the cause, seriously. If we can make this thing grow, then NA/EU will have enough financial support to be legitimately competitive worldwide. All we need is a lot of fans who are vocalizing their support, and sponsors will take notice. Maybe we can even get an NA/EU version of KeSPA... that would be a **big** step forward for us.",,False,,t5_2wenn,1374494924.0,,,True,t3_1iswo8,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1iswo8/in_response_to_lemonnation_on_why_na_has_failed/,

**Reliance on Doublelift and the Spring LCS**

Spring Split CLG relied heavily on Doublelift to win their games, often funneling as much as their gold as possible into their ADC in hopes of him carrying. A good way to gauge who would win a CLG game would be to look at Doublelift's KDA and CS around the 15-20 minute mark. If he was struggling or behind, it almost certainly spelled defeat for the team. Sometimes Link would pick up the slack and carry, but for the most part, the team hung of the back of their star ADC. This CLG paradigm was not due to lack of skill among other players, but was rather because of individual play styles.

HotshotGG often favored tanks, playing Shen, Galio, Malphite, and Cho'gath in a majority of his games. Instead of playing carry toplaners to pose more of a threat in lane, he opted for tankier champions to split push for map pressure, and then to damage soak in teamfights. While this strategy was not *unsuccessful*, it did add a certain level of predictability to the team before the game had even begun. Other LCS teams never had to worry much about a ""wildcard"" factor coming from the toplane, becuase they understood the distinct way in which Hotshot played the game: pick a high-durability-low-threat champion, stay in lane, farm as much as possible, come to help team during dragon, then head back to lane. This playstyle isn't inefficient, but when a person or team plays the same way over and over again, opponents can find the pattern and subsequently abuse it. A prime example of this was the recent OGN Finals in which CJ Entus Blaze, who had been utilizing a minion push strategy for a 13 win streak **(more [in-depth look by MonteChristo] (http://ggchronicle.com/montecristo-analysis-blazes-slow-minion-push-or-the-sixth-man/) )**, was crushed by MVP Ozone, who had carefully crafted strategies and compositions to counter Blaze's predictable tactics. In a similar fashion, HotshotGG never truly posed too much of a threat simply because his opponents were able to work around his limited champion pool and play style.

At the mid lane was Link, who showed high promise but rarely carried his team and provided threat like the likes of Reginald or mandatorycloud or Scarra (look at Scarra's Yi and Zed play at MLG and compare it to Link's Nidalee during the spring split). Link was a threat, but never really snowballed and carried games hard. Chauster, the team's jungler, was extremely underwhelming and consistently failed to make big plays or carry. 

This left a majority of the carrying job to Doublelift, who was often forced into hypercarries, such as Vayne and Twitch, or Ezreal due to his extremely safe nature. Aphromoo's lack of longtime synergy and experience as a support, however, kept Doublelift's lane a bit suboptimal. This is not to say Aphromoo wasn't a good support, but there was a clear discrepancy in Doublelift's performance when compared to Doublelift's season 2 play, or his Allstar performance when paired with Xpecial, one of the best supports in North America.

All in all, CLG was a team with great potential (lolgetit?) but a lack of threats across the map and a bottom lane with little experience gave CLG an extremely inconsistent Spring Season, where they were eventually knocked down to relegation matches. 
----------
------------------
**The New CLG**

Before the summer split of LCS began, things looked hazy for CLG. HotshotGG, one of the team's founders and most seasoned veterans to the game, retired, along with Aphromoo. Nien was acquired to fill the top lane, but was previously an ADC player and thus lacking any competitive top lane experience. BigfatLP, the former midlaner and sub for the team, was recruited into the jungle, and Chauster was switched back to support, in hopes of the CLG bottom lane returning to it's Season 2's world-class form.

After three weeks in LCS, CLG, the team with the most roster/role swaps of all NA teams, is tied for second place. 

**Link Rising**

Abandoning his old utility/poke oriented play style (Orianna, Lux, and Nidalee), Link has come out swinging during the summer, playing champions such as Zed, Twisted Fate, Karthus, and Jayce, champions *who make kills happen*. Link thus far has played spectacularly, carrying games as hard as, if not harder in some instances, than Doublelift. His roaming playstyle and aggression have proven to be fruitful, and Link has established himself as a true threat. Jungler camping bottom? No problem, Link will roam top, get Nien a kill and help him snowball. Link's performance has drastically improved since the Spring Split, and his new pool of champions have begun to unleash their terror on their enemies. As the season progresses, and Link gets more and more comfortable carrying, I predict Link to become one of the most feared mid laners in all North America.

**The Surprising New Top**

Considering the fact that he was not a top lane player before this Summer Split, Nien has been playing very well. Currently sitting at the 3rd highest KDA among NA toplaners, Nien has transitioned into his new role beautifully, and continues to improve with each game. He has thus far demonstrated an extremely diverse champion pool and varying play styles, from tanking with Malphite, to carrying with Elise, to somewhere in between with Jarvan. Those who saw the CLG v TSM game saw Nien flourish and demonstrate the beginnings of what will hopefully be a fantastic season for the rookie top. With a hard work ethic and proper practice, combined with his impressive mechanical skills, Nien has the potential to become one of the best.

**Bigfat Returns**

While previously the mid laner for CLG, bigfatlp was often criticized for falling short in lane, despite his incredible teamfight mechanics and focus. Now, as the new jungler for CLG, bigfat has foregone the lane phase entirely and instead become one with the jungle. While Chauster is often hailed as the mastermind by CLG, bigfatlp possesses a certain brilliance in-game that makes him incredible to watch. Bigfatlp builds as a tank exclusively, regardless of the champion, in a way that is a bit reminiscent of Hotshot. The difference here, however, is that as a Jungler, bigfatlp's unique tank style is harder to abuse than a top laner's. In addition, bigfatlp plays champions that can duel invading junglers quite well (Nocturne) or CC enemies down until his team can come help (Sejuani and Nasus). His teamfight decision making and skill is outstanding, and he seems to always escape fights with sub 10% hp, knowing the exact limits of his champion. In addition to his near-flawless tanking, he possesses a rare gift among North American junglers: the ability to time his smites perfectly. Simply put, bigfat *does not miss smite.* He essentially does not miss when his team is starting an objective, and has smite-stolen many when the enemy has started it instead. His incredible smiting ability, combined with a genius playstyle, is what makes bigfat the behind-the-scenes hero of the team.

**Finding Their Roots in the Bot Lane**

During Season 2 of League of Legends, CLG's bot lane, Chauster and Doubelift, was arguably one of the best in the world. Doublelift was coached by Chauster, who had previously been the team's ADC, and the mentor and student quickly became one of the most feared duo's in the game. Chauster was eventually switched to jungle, but after an extremely disappointing performance there, he has made his way back to support. While Chauster is still obviously the weakest member of the team, he has demonstrated in the past that he can be a top-tier support. Currently his performance fluctuates as wildly as Curse's has this split: he will either **[make an amazing play](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9plbE0FscIM)**, or **[get caught out and give up first blood for free](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ahi9ii4l9w)** (both of these clips are from the exact same game). If Chauster is able to return to his Season 2 form, which he most certainly has the capability of doing, then CLG's bot lane will become feared once again.

**A Bright Future for CLG (the TLDR)**

CLG has essentially taken everything that made them weak previously and changed it. While there are new problems, such as Chauster and Nien getting acclimated to their new roles, and sometimes questionable in-game objective prioritizing, their old problems have been widely dispersed. The predictability of their top laner is gone, and now actually have carry tops when they are needed. The team has an outstanding jungler that provides presence and extreme objective control, coupled with excellent team fighting control. Mid lane has seen a tremendous growth and is sometimes the biggest threat on the entire team. Bot lane is now only one part of a triple threat team, rather than a 1.5 or two threat team. I truly believe that if CLG can overcome their current issues such as re-prioritizing objective control and working on where they funnel their CS, CLG can be the #1 team in NA.

I made a post on r/LoL but as you all probably know, it's hard to have an elaborate discussion about a issue over there. 

A nice redditor, sent me a private message telling me about this subreddit (I didn't know about it), so I'm basically reposting here, wishing for a constructive discussion around this issue.

My Original post reads:

""As a Rumble main, I'm interested in analyzing any Rumble nerfs/buffs, so I decided to make a spreadsheet to see the damage difference during it's duration.
First of all I see there's a lot of discussion whether Rumble needed a nerf. IMHO, even tho I'd like him to stay the same so I could get to Gold, he did need a slight nerf/change, he was really strong (I think he will still be strong). People's argument is that Rumble has had the highest win % of the game for quite a while, while a valid argument, Rumble's win % is highly affected both by people not knowing how to play against him properly (well, at least in Silver I'm pretty sure people don't) and by only being played by people who do know how to play him proper, since he ain't a popular champ.
About the ult.. it was way too strong, gave him insane sniping ability and dealt too much dmg upfront. You would specially notice this while playing mid cause you get squishier opponents.
I think with this change, Rumble will be more balanced while keeping nearly the same win % (will decrease a bit once people realize how to play against him), its not an overnerf (see why in the next paragraph) it just stops you from sniping people so easily.
Now.. about the spreadsheet, what I've noticed with it, is that since ticks start 0.5 seconds earlier, if the opponent stays exactly 2 seconds on the ult, you will be dealing more damage than before (not truth if you stay 2.5 seconds). Same applies for 3 and 4.
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AvuNgCEOn0dDdFkwdEdaRFFlckZVdTFTWUEwVzkta2c#gid=0
Please let me know if there's something wrong with it, so I can fix it. I assumed the avg AP values I have in each of those levels.
TL;DR: Ult dmg nerf balanced Rumble and is not as bad as people think. At exactly 2, 3 and 4 seconds you even deal more dmg.
EDIT: Just noticed that @lvl6 with 70 AP you will be dealing 3 more dmg than before if opponent stays 1 exact second.

EDIT 2: Can't test cause I'm at work, but can someone check if it ticks for 5 or 6 times now (0s,1s,2s,3s,4s) or (0s,1s,2s,3s,4s,5s) ? (would really like to have help on this one)

Edit 3: Fun fact: At 0.5 seconds, previous Lvl2 Ult with 180 AP would deal 146 more dmg than new Lvl3 ult with 350 AP.

Now were looking at the EU LCS *Players*.  

All of the insights found here were pulled from this [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0ArSHC5_zvDWWdGFUclJpMExKQm9YbnRsUkl1MndMSEE&amp;output=html).  If you use any of this data please credit me, it was a pain to collect. 


**KDA**

*KDA Data was pulled from Riots website and is odd, I'll calculate it myself next time, sorry.  It remains true that Gambit has a low KDA given their relative success*

I think that KDA is an absolutely absurd statistic, and while I employ it as a secondary tool to gauge champion strength I find it pretty ridiculous in differentiating individual player strength.  That being said, some people are going to want the data.  So here is the top KDA for each position.

* Top Lane: Soaz, Fnatic 4.6
* Jungler: HyrqBot, SK 6.1 (malunoo's stats not on lolesports)
* Mid Lane: xPeke, Fnatic 4.7 (Bjergsen's stats not on lolesports)
* ADC: CandyPanda, Sk, 6.8
* Support: edWard, Gambit Gaming, 6.3

Interesting Evil Genius doesn't claim top spot in any position, despite being number 2 in the league.  Furthermore Gambit Gaming's (#3) Alex Ich and Diamondprox KDA are among the lowest for their position in the EU LCS.  I'm sure Alex Ich's opponents would agree that he is a mid laner to be feared. So can we get over KDA? Its silly. 

**Champion Pool**

With only 24 games we can't entirely judge a players champion pool, the opportunity to play some certain champions might not have come up yet.  Its still a pretty interesting variable. 

Method of Measurement

To measure champion pool first we look at number of champions a player had played divided by number of games they've played.  We'll call this the variety coefficient, the closer it is to 1 the more variety a player has made in their picks.  Unfortunately not all players have played the same number of games, so players who've played more should be given some extra consideration.  Win/Losses should be considered last as a loss might indicate a given champion is not really in a player's pool, or but there are many other factors in a loss.    

**Wide Champion Pools**

* Bjergson, Hyrqbot, Malunoo, Shlaya, Shushei, Spontexx, Virtu4l have played a different champion in each of their games. 
* Of those Malunoo, Shushei, Spontexx are all on Dragonborns, they have run through quite a wide selection of champions in their 4 games.
* Hyrqbot has played 6 different champions, more than anyone else.  He's done this while maintaining the top KDA for a Jungler and a 3-3 record. 
* Alex Ich, Froggen, xPeke and Snoopeh have all played 5 Champions, over 6 or 7 games, with good win loss records.  

**Smaller Champion Pools**

* Supports Karalius, Babeta, and Krepo have used the smallest amount of champions.  1 for Karalius and 2 for Babeta and Krepo.  They've all had at least okay success with these champions, and haven't felt the need (or have been prevented from) to play another champion
* Next smallest are EG Wickd and Yellowpete.  ADC don't draw a lot of bans, so I assume Yellowpete has been playing his comfort champs, but I wouldn't be surprised if he has a much wider range of champions.  Wickd also has the benefit of Froggen “soaking up” bans allowing him to play what he wants.  Wickd's small champion pool was a problem at the Season 2 finals, but from what I've heard about Wickd's stream (Top Karma, Top Zed) and all the emphasis EG has put on expanding champion pools, I wouldn't be surprised if his pool is much larger than he has shown us.  
* Exter also has a relatively small champion pool.  He has played Ryze or Twisted Fate in 6 out of 7 games.  With a record of 3-3 on those champions, it hasn't slowed him down too drastically. 

My conclusions from looking at champion pools are:  I feel like Hyrqbot is being underrated, I haven't heard much hype about him at all. EG has a couple players with massive, scary, champion pools, which has allowed their other players to stick to a small roster of champions for the time being.  I literally have no idea what the next team comp out of Dragonborns will be.

**Player Awards**

* The Serial Killer (most kills in a single game) Kev1n's Olaf 11
* Undying (most 0 death games) Froggen 4, Snoopeh 4
* Best Friend (most assists in a single game) Nyph Sona 22, Hryqbot Shen 22
* Skumbag Award (most kills in a single game by a support player) edWard's Sona 4, edWard Thresh's 3.

**Random Facts that didn't fit anywhere**

* Sk has the slowest win 49.08 min (beating CW) 
* Average game length is about 40 min.
* Blue and red have split nearly even 13-11

1371777646.0,30,self.summoners,1grlun,Curse: The Ebb and Flow of the Meta,37,7,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1grlun/curse_the_ebb_and_flow_of_the_meta/,"In the early days of LCS Spring Split, Curse reigned as the team to beat. They were running Taric and Jarvan in majority of their games, taking advantage of the passive armor auras from the two of most outrageous and regal, respectively, champions in the game. Elementz, the former support for Curse, once jokingly said, ""With Taric, I just go around, press E, and win the lane (/hearty laugh, beard and chin shakes)."" They cruised through many of their games due to the cohesion of the champions of that meta that emphasized early aggression during the laning phase. However, as Reginald often states, League of Legends is an ever-changing game. Like a flowing river, League of Legends is never the same game as the one a year ago (hell, even 6 months ago).

Taric and Jarvan received substantial nerfs to both of their main stay skills (the W and E respectively). Assassins that power-up at level 6 and 9 as well as specific champions that Voyboy pioneered have received the brunt of the nerf hammer (Elise [release], Akali, Renekton [due to 2v1, inability to take advantage of strong 1v1 early game], Diana, Olaf, Nidalee [falling out of meta due to 2v1]). Unmovable mid laners such as Morgana have fallen out of favor, only to be replaced by AD assassins that clean-up fights rather than start them (Zed, Kha are the most popular). Although much seething rage was spewed over keyboards about Curse's bot lane since Week 7 of the LCS Spring Split, it was much ado about nothing as an astute spectator can see, the meta and Curse's current champion pool does not favor their early aggression style.

Curse excelled at having two options during the early laning phase: 2v1 or let Voyboy 1v1. Voyboy, at the time of the meta, could not be stopped in a 1v1. Before the maturation/emergence of Zionspartan or Sycho Sid to match his aggressive playstyle, Voyboy remained supreme as the epitome of 1v1, balls to the wall, ""kill-you-snowball the lane"" ability. He was highly touted as one of the the best top laners in the world. A great representation of this is his 1v2 Olaf against AG in the S3 qualifier (against V Bloodwater's old team, no less; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjOBv8SlVb4[1] ). However, this style soon died down due to the CJE Blaze Flame (old strategy, but effective) strategy of freezing the lane and slow-pushing after the early tower siege as well as the emergence of a more prevalent and smarter 2v1 early game. With Curse's reluctance in securing early dragons or sieging more towers (4~6 minutes), the freezing strategy allows the other solo laner to gain much needed CS, decreasing any skill disadvantage between the two laners.

NyJacky remains one of the most adorable players in the League of Legends scene. Even without a pair of boobs and a generous push-up bra, his cries of ""Was good doe?!"" are more attractive than any wailing, alluring siren. Despite all the positive personal characteristics, NyJacky's fun demeanor does not translate well into today's League of Legend's meta. Never known as an AP-carry, Jacky tends not to carry games because of his rather average laning phase and teamfighting. Jacky is not terrible in both aspects. He does not die much in lane, nor does he teamfight horrendously. He is never behind much in CS, but he is never ahead by much in CS. His play style may result in an inability to capitalize on Curse's early aggression. It is fine that Jacky is solid during the early laning phase; however, he never snowballs. With his play style, he cannot snowball. One of the major weaknesses he exhibits is his inability to roam or counter the roam. He loves pitching a lovely tent for his teddy bear in that mid lane without putting too much pressure when the jungler or opposing mid laner is away. This allows the other laner to roam more frequently and make more plays (and with Edward as well as Saint's [he only buys 1 ward; places it at banana bush/Jacky's wraith ramp on purple/blue at ~6 minutes] lack of warding during the 8-15 minutes of the game) which becomes a large problem to the other Curse laners. Jacky and Curse made up for this with a strong mid lane brickwall champion like Morgana or an inherently gank-heavy champion like Twisted Fate (his kit is built for vision control and ganking) to make up for Jacky's weakness. Fitting to this post's theme, those champions were nerfed and severely weakened, thus weakening Jacky and Curse.

Cop is currently the most hated AD on the planet. He takes way too much unnecessary flack for his ""lack of skill."" Mechanically, he is a solid player. He can perform all the necessary functions of an AD carry. He deals damage during teamfights, lanes well enough (doesn't fall 30 cs behind like other ADs), and keeps alive. Yet, like Jacky, he is just lacking that ""something"" that would put him over the top. To put it in perspective, he is like the Chris Bosh (NBA basketball player) of the team. A team player in every sense of the word, he does specific things well, but MENTALLY, he is built of paper. Like a horrible pinball machine, Cop tilts. ""Why am I so bad?"" he often asks himself. Doublelift makes up for his often self-deprecation with outlandish claims that, at times, he backs up with his play. Cop, although solid in play, does not see that he is improving. The words of the people as well as his teammates (Saint, although in jest) put him in a negative state of mind that affects his play. If he can improve mentally, you will see this Cop become a fat donut eating Cop once again.

Edward. Love his play style. Makes aggressive plays all around the map during the mid game. However, his warding just needs work. STUDY SOME MADLIFE x MATA.

The jungle may have changed, but Saintvicious has not. Always one of the most formidable early game ganking-centric junglers, Saint does not shy away from early turret dives or flash+catch aggression. Although the champions that are available have the Saintvicious style embedded into their kit, Saintvicious has not been keeping up with the times. Something has happened that has negatively affected our oldest LCS member. Like the Chevy Vega (a highly marketed and praised car in the early years that fell apart later because of reliability, safety, and rust problems), Saintvicious, once praised, is lauded as arrogant, selfish, and fitting to his name, vicious, to his teammates. It may be bias, but Liquid112, the manager of Curse, spoke highly of Saintvicious as one of the most game-smart individuals of the game; however, it has become increasingly apparent that his game-knowledge has rusted. His once on-point calls have not become reliable (baron attempts as well as dragon calls, smiting timers; yet ironically, his smiting prowess has increased). His safety during the mid/late game is suspect (watch All-Star LCS 2013 against China, Summer Split Day 1 against Vulcan, Cloud 9), with several occasions being caught out of position. To reminisce about the early times, Saintvicious's Xin, Voli, Udyr, Skarner, Olaf, Jarvan, Hecarim were all fearsome to behold. Yet the nerf hammer--an undefeated champion--trounced them all (this is not to say that all of them are weak, there are still strong champions [Jarvan, Hecarim, Udyr to a lesser extent, are all reliable picks]. However, what really seems to have rusted is his team's ability to survive even through champion select.

Curse has never been a phenomenal team fight team. They channel most of their energy into dive compositions (though they tried a poke composition one time during the Summer Split, but threw away any chance of a comeback by getting caught three consecutive times in the mid game) that focus on eliminating the enemy team's threats as soon as possible. During the Spring Split, they focused on mostly running their comps with Morgana/Malphite, Jarvan (and perhaps Olaf, Elise, Akali [clean-up]) as the main front line, designated to dive the enemy's back line as soon as possible, quickly seeking to eliminate any semblance of enemy counterplay. Cop was allowed to wreak havoc with evasive/long range AD carries like MF, Cait, EZ, and Corki while his support protected him. However, this specific composition became old hat quite quickly. Even with the shift of the meta away from their main frontline champions, it does not remain their main problem. Curse, like most teams, tries to get the team comp of their choice as their top priority. Unfortunately for them, their inability to ban the correct champions against the enemy team's strengths is one of their great weaknesses.

The end of Spring Split (weeks 8-10, playoffs) as well as the beginning of Summer Split have shown that three bans are not enough bans for Curse. Their inability to masterfully play the strong champions at the moment have proved deadly for them during this phase of the game. They do not prioritize Jayce, Zed, Kha as top tier first picks, nor do they choose the champions that would fit their style like Karthus, Orianna, Kennen (a champion that is very strong when acting as a protector of the AD rather than a dive champion due to well known knock-back counters like Janna), Shen, Rumble (still strong), Ryze. If these champions are not selected, they have very few prioritized options that they fall back on (a nerfed TF, Zac, Thresh, nerfed Elise, Tryndamere). This allows for so much counterplay due to the bans that the other team can do. With this advanced knowledge, the other team can ban three of the few strong champions that Curse excels at. Chauster, after a scrim with Curse where Voyboy played Jayce, once exclaimed in his somewhat nasally yet hoarse voice, ""THAT'S WHY YOU DON'T BAN JAYCE AGAINST CURSE (snort snort)."" Also, their solo laners both cannot/refuse to play the strong champions at the moment (no Jayce, Zed, Kha, Xerath). The meta of seemingly strong champions is not favoring this Curse team, but do not despair, Curse fans, there is hope!",,False,,t5_2wenn,1371783689.0,,Ryze,True,t3_1grlun,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1grlun/curse_the_ebb_and_flow_of_the_meta/,

1367378366.0,30,self.summoners,1dgjyv,Discussion: Starting Items on Manaless Champs after 3.6,35,5,54,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1dgjyv/discussion_starting_items_on_manaless_champs/,"Patch 3.6 brought, amongst many other changes, a nerf to two very popular starts: Fort Pot/Ward/4-pots, and 9 pots/two wards.  These changes were needed, as many champions were abusing these starts - particularly 9 pots, making it near impossible to get meaningful harassment on an opponent.

However, the problem now is - the champions that started 9 pots/2 wards are left with minimal options.  Specifically, I'm talking about Rumble, Akali, and Katarina.  All of these champions scale off of AP, don't use mana, and are often matched against other AP champions.  Through these three factors alone, most of the standard starts are outright eliminated as options.

* **Cloth Armor and 5 pots** - While some AP champions will punish these melee-range champions with auto-attack harass, it's rarely enough to warrant starting cloth armor.
* **HP pots, Mana pots, and Ward(s)** - The numbers here aren't specified because I don't know the standard number - I usually make it up on the spot whenever I run this.  But nevertheless, the mana potions are obviously useless.
* **Faerie Charm, HP pots, and Ward(s)** - Again, the lack of mana makes Faerie Charm worthless.

This leaves us with, as I see it, a few options, all of which are sub-optimal:

* **Fort Pot, 1 Ward, 1 HP pot** - Fort pot wasn't excellent on these champs in the first place, and with the increased cost, doesn't seem worth it, for something you get minimal scaling off of.  Also, the one HP pot leaves you with a significant lack of sustain.
* **5 HP pots, 4 Wards** - Excessive?  Maybe.  But if you stay in lane for a long time, those wards will help out.  Alternatively you can use one or two of them to ward up the enemy jungle. Still, leaves you lacking a lot of stats for 475 gold.
* **5 HP pots, 1-2 Wards, extra gold** - Not necessarily a bad choice, but just leaves you 155 gold behind your enemy at the start.  It also just feels bad to leave base not having spent that much.
* **Null Magic Mantle and 2 HP pots** - What you lack for sustain you make up for in defense.  This start compensates for a week early game with increased defensive stats.  Still, Null Magic Mantle doesn't have many build paths - off the top of my head, the only one really appropriate for APs is Twin Shadows.
* **Amplifying Tome and 1 HP pot** - The Aggressive start - lacking sustain, but relying heavily on damage.  That lack of sustain is pretty iffy.

So I don't think I have a conclusion, other than that Manaless AP champs don't really have a good start now.  What have you guys been running on your Kat/Akali/Rumble?",,False,,t5_2wenn,False,,Nautilus,True,t3_1dgjyv,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1dgjyv/discussion_starting_items_on_manaless_champs/,
1367291854.0,30,self.summoners,1ddyqd,Any analysis of GGU?,36,6,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1ddyqd/any_analysis_of_ggu/,"Are there any articles on GGU's playstyle? Haven't really seen any, but I'm curious what writers think about them.

Here are my two cents (just from looking closely at PlayOffs):

**Strategy**

Their team strategy utilizes their two largest strengths (ZionSpartan &amp; DontMashMe). ZionSpartan will continually split-push the side lanes which forces the enemy team to respond. Usually the response is one of two options:

1) Send 1 member against ZionSpartan

2) Send all members and push another lane

**Accordingly:**

*Send 1 member against ZionSpartan* -
ZionSpartan will decide either to engage or retreat. If he retreats, I've noticed that he immediately begins to push the opposite lane until he feels like he can 1v1. If he engages, his 1v1 skills really show. If he wins, the enemy team basically is forced to sacrifice a lane to either ZionSpartan or the other 4 members... or both.

*Send all members and push another lane* - 
This is the most common response I've seen. GGU seems to deliberately avoid pushing the mid lane while ZionSpartan pushes the side lanes. This makes very good sense. GGU wants to force a favorable teamfight under a GGU turret. At the end of the day, even if the teamfight ends up with an even trade, GGU wins because ZionSpartan has been pushing down towers in the side lane. In these teamfights, DontMashMe becomes a huge factor.

**Random Notes:**

1) GGU has always picked ZionSpartan's champion after other team has selected their top-laner (At least since Playoffs). Seems like they really want him to win his matchup.

2) ZionSpartan's common picks (Riven, Jayce, Vlad, Khazix) are all extremely hard to pin down, have great wave clear, and can deal lots of damage.

3) GGU's splitpush is a little different from CLG's splitpush because CLG tries to push both lanes at the same time.

4) Of GGU's 5 losses in playoffs, the other team had a global (Noc, Shen, TF, Karthus) in 4 of them. The 5th loss, ZionSpartan chose Rumble.

1362607139.0,30,self.summoners,19svwq,The Viability of Sivir,37,7,68,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/19svwq/the_viability_of_sivir/,"Recently there was a thread about the viability of Ashe, and I thought a similar title was relevant. However, instead of focusing on why Sivir *is still very viable*, I'd like to focus this discussion on *why she has fallen out of favor* or has seen less screen-time. I'd also like to discuss how we can go about changing this - either through different builds or team compositions, or through changes to her abilities, base stats or her passive. If you're not familiar with her skillset or stats - [LoLWiki link](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Sivir).

I'm going to refrain from making this an insane wall, to keep the discussion as the main focus of the thread and not just commentary on my personal ideas/arguments/reasons. I'm in the process of watching and finding some recent (if any) vods of her in competitive play, so I'll link them as I watch/find them. **If I make any mistakes in my very basic math (in the process of studying for tests so not doing anything very intricate), please point it out!**

**To start off, let's take a look at her base stats:**

Her base AD is average, along with her ASP and ASP/level (which are slightly above average). Her mana pool is very small at 203, when her abilities chunk for so much mana early on. This can be negated by Spellshield, but is hardly efficient if the opposing lane trades with autos, and it relies on counter-play in order to function.

At 387 HP, she falls almost exactly on the average HP of most adc champions. However, her 12.75 base armor is amongst the lowest, and as you know all adc champions share 30 base MR and 0 MR/level.

Her range is one of the problems that immediately brings up issues with her base HP and armor: At 500 range, she has *the lowest range of all adc champions*, along with Kog'Maw. Considering her low base HP and armor, this opens her up to very unfavorable trades early against common picks such as Ezreal, Caitlyn and even Vayne early on. Kog'Maw can get around this low range through his W, and it can be argued that Sivir can hit targets outside her range with her W. However, these hits deal less damage and the ability is rarely leveled to a point where it trades favorably until the laning phase is over.

While her range is problematic in the laning phase, it can be overcome by trading with her Q rather than autos. Her passive also allows her to get in and out of range quickly. However, it is during team fights and the endgame that she suffers greatly.

**Next, let's take a look at her abilities themselves:**

**Sivir's passive** is very similar to the Furor boots enchantment, something that was discussed at length recently (I suggest you look into it: [can be found here](http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/19iusb/furor_boots_turn_snowballs_into_avalanches/)). However, it only procs on champions and not on minions. With her already low range, getting into range without taking extra damage can be problematic. 50 movespeed is a large increase, but it doesn't scale throughout the game. It is very strong in teamfights and with positioning, but with her short range it ends up rather lackluster.

**Her Boomerang Blade (Q)** has very long range, but has a downside: it has maximum damage and AP ratios, as well as a 20% damage reduction per target hit (down to a minimum damage, with a percentage reduction). However, the damage potential on this ability is higher than any damaging ability of any other adc:

Doing some basic math, at level 5 with 160 AD the Q (assuming that it hits only your one target, and that it hits twice, before armor/arpen is taken into account) hits for 748.8 physical damage (maximum damage - without maximum it hits for 915.2 physical damage). This is a huge chunk of damage - *but it has a 20% reduction per target hit on both spins to a minimum of 166.4* at the same level and AD. Hitting multiple targets diminishes the damage of this ability a truckload. It is also very gimmicky to land on targets due to it's long range and slow projectile speed. The range is definitely very strong, but can be detrimental in some cases.

**Ricochet (W)** is one of the most awesome abilities for any adc - your attacks can hit multiple targets! While the initial attack is limited by her base range, it has the potential to chain for quite a distance, with bounce range of 450. As with her Q, this ability also has a percentage reduction per hit with a minimum damage. The mana cost and considering the opening level 1 damage boost makes it very mana inefficient to use for quick pokes/trades during the laning phase, and can run you oom in fights!

Again, some basic math: Initial hit at level 5 with 160 AD will chunk for 360 (200 bonus damage) before armor/arpen, down to a minimum damage of 238.8 before armor/arpen. This ability can bounce up to 5 times, but it is sometimes (especially during the laning phase and teamfights) very difficult to predict. There seems to be no preference between champions, monsters or minions, and it simply goes for the closest available target.

**EDIT: Silly me, forgetting this part:**

W resets your auto animation, allowing you to trade a bit better than I might have make it come across (I tend to forget  to mention auto-resetting abilities because I just automatically do that already).

**The Spell Shield (E)** is a very nifty ability that also serves as Sivir's escape/survival mechanism (her ultimate can also be counted as such, more on that later). During the 3-sec window of the ability, *any enemy ability used on Sivir will proc the shield*. This does not count for Zilean bombs already on you, or any ability that is already on affect on your champion, nor for any AoE ability that remains on the floor.

It is incredibly strong against champions that rely on a single spell to deal a large amount of damage or hard-CC ability, but it can be procced very easily. Anything from a stray Ezreal W or AoE ability can knock the shield off. This opens her up to a lot of counter-play from the opposing team. The mana regained can make up for her high mana costs, but as mentioned before this relies on the opposing players actually using abilities on you, and as such cannot give mana on demand.

**Finally, we get to her ultimate, On The Hunt (R).** Before saying anything, this ability scales incredibly well with an auto-centered team and especially with other AoE steroids such as Armor Shredding, Taric's R, and such. Do not misjudge her ultimate in a team that includes Jax, Jarvan IV, Taric and Elise - from personal experience I can tell you they hurt!

The big downside: a cast time. Using it as an escape can often get you caught in that one second of casting it, and similarly while chasing, it drops off half of your passive and can let your target get away. The upside: 60% increased asp on level 3. That is a huge amount! It also applies half of the increased attack speed to your team, which, as mentioned before, is significant.

Unfortunately, her ultimate is pretty much a self-buff if your team doesn't rely on autos. It's still strong, but not nearly as much compared to if your team can benefit from it properly. This is one of the arguments as to why she's seen so little in the past - teams simply didn't gain enough from her ultimate.

**EDIT: Her ultimate does affect minions (no cannon confirmation but multiple reports of it - I'll check it out soon^tm ). This opens up very strong split-pushing potential outside of her already strong split-pushing, as you can easily punish your opponents for leaving towers open or for delaying without taking objectives.**

I think that, with the rise of assassins, melee AD champions and high-damage bruisers, her ultimate could be potentially gamebreaking with damage output.

**What does Sivir have going for her (besides luck - engineer reference^lame ^joke)?**

She has very high damage output potential, the ability to block any ability targeted on her, very strong farming ability and a strong team steroid.

**The downsides?**

Very short auto range, and lack of a proper escape for such low auto range. Her shield can be gimped and the openings for counter-play is extremely high. In the past it has felt like Sivir was a niche-pick, but that may change with the recent season 3 changes.

Her walk animation is terrible! Not to mention the bug that makes her attack and Q animation disappear. Her ultimate requires a cast time and her mana costs are pretty high.

**Some concluding thoughts:**

Regarding item builds: feel free to discuss them, but as that math has ready been done and this thread is for discussion around the champion and not the theory-wise best possible build, and given that there are so many different builds, it would take ages for me to incorporate that in here effectively. How she performs with the new items is something I haven't personally tested yet, so please give some feedback in that regard if you can! I'll try my best to try her out as well.

Regarding ruins and masteries: As with item builds, discuss them! Alternative setups are great to hear of and to discuss, but ares imply too many in number to include every option here. I've run 21/6/3, with AD marks/armor yellows/mr per level blues and flat ad/lifesteal quints on her mostly, but haven't played her a whole lot in S3. I don't want to theorize too much before I'm sure of what is silly and what is workable - this is where input would be very much appreciated!

------------------------------------------------------

The idea is not to try and scream RIOT PLS FIX, but to come up with solutions or arguments to show/exploit her strengths, and to discuss Sivir as a champion.

This is also not a champion guide, but rather a discussion. Again, item discussions and comparisons are encouraged!

This is why I came to love the asian scene (picking Jayce support, Lissandra support, Annie/Brand bot) or a guy like Daydreamin (GGU) who isn't afraid to bring a strange pick (like Leblanc or Yorick) into competitive play. Props to Elementz too for his Fiddlesticks or MuffinQT for his Morgana (wombo combo with kata mid, IIRC).

------------------------------

I would like to know your favorite odd picks/builds.

Here are mine. Don't forget, I'm not saying those are OP champs, this is just for fun and playing something different.

I personally love Lissandra for her all-in initiating power. However I have to admit she is lacking a lot if your AD picked something can't capitalize well on agression. If you are losing the lane and you don't get some help  from your jungler, it's quite a pain to make a comeback. Go Philo, Ruby Sightstone, Boots of Speed, Zhonya. (Morgana Support Style.) Don't forget you can now build shurelya but also michael's crucible out of the philo stone. I recently learnt you gained MS and a heal when using it (for those wondering you can use it on yourself too).

I also enjoy playing AD Thresh as a support when the lane is doing well. Philo, Ruby Sightstone, Berzerker, BotRK, Phage. With tons of Magic Res /lvl for glyphs. Max E, get every soul, don't forget to ward, ???, profit. 

AD Carry Thresh + Blitz is actually quite good too. I think I have a 75% win rate out of 15-20 games. When I play AD Carry I go BotRK, Berz, Trinity, 2xZephyr + last item. CDR as thresh spells cds are super long, super good AS, tons of MS and a bit of AD (u actually rely on your souls as much as you do on your AD: I'm usually dealing 2/3rd phys and 1/3 magical damage which is a pain to itemize against when I get the advantage.) It's not OP but still pretty viable as it scales well into late game thanks to the souls.
I'd like to add that Zephyrs are actually quite good to stack as you only lose on the tenacity. All the other stats stay available.

Finally I think Nautilus is really nice. He used to be my main support before his W nerf. And now that they reverted it back, I got to play him again 5 or 6 games and I don't think we lost once. Max W, get HP and CD. Mobi boots or/and Shurelya as he is quite the slow giant walking armor.

-------------------------------

I've also tried a lot of other supports such as Kennen, Mundo, Zil, Elise even before pro players did but i was maxing the wrong ability (noob me), lux, fizz, jayce......... But I don't want to write too much as I want to get some ideas from you.

1362917844.0,33,self.summoners,1a0rhv,Forgoing the AD carry and the strengths of BotRK - a new strategy?,36,3,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1a0rhv/forgoing_the_ad_carry_and_the_strengths_of_botrk/,"This probably isn't news to anyone, but it seems that teams are warming up to the idea that not every team needs an AD carry. Doublelift has voiced complaints over a lot of AD carries getting shut out of the metagame because of cheap, cost-effective items like Warden's Mail and Warmog's Armor making their life hell. We all remember League of Warmog's, that period when an Olaf would run out of top lane with thousands upon thousands of health, as well as a Warden's Mail and Ninja Tabi. AD carries would just cry - with only an Infinity Edge (or worse, a Bloodthirster), there wasn't much room to do anything.

So, what's the solution? Buff Blade of the Ruined King? That didn't go so well. Buff Black Cleaver and other armor penetration items? I'm not sure I want to see that again either. Teams have instead warmed to the 'tankkillers' of League of Legends - Vayne, Kog'maw and Varus championing this cause. However, I don't think that's the only solution.

Azubu TPA just came off a win in the Garena Premier League against the ill-fated Kuala Lumpur Hunters. While it wasn't the most competitive of games, we saw TPA run an unusual team comp featuring Bebe on AP Nidalee, and DinteR on Soraka. Their physical damage largely came from Toyz' Kha'zix, so they weren't exactly lacking on the AD front. With incredible amounts of poke from Toyz and Bebe, on top of relentless splitpushing from Stanley's Shen, they were able to grind out a win. The combination of Nidalee and Soraka fascinated me - two heals and strong poke means that it'll take a lot of effort to stop Nidalee from farming. 

It got me thinking - what other ways could we remove the AD carry from the equation, while still being able to win and deal with bruisers? There was a very beefy Irelia on the side of KLH, which Stanley responded to with a Blade of the Ruined King (yes, on Shen). In its current incarnation, I believe Blade of the Ruined King serves two purposes:

* Cheap lifesteal item for carries, providing a small peel
* Anti-bruiser weapon for autoattackers

Riot probably intended it this way. Blade of the Ruined King is currently pretty effective at doing those two things. It doesn't leave you helpless against the League of Warmog's and is a versatile item capable of being picked up by a variety of champions. 

I propose this: it is no longer necessary to have an AD carry to beat bruisers and have a strong lategame. Plenty of champions are very strong in the lategame, they don't have to be AD carries. Toyz' Kha'zix, for example, dealt out frightening amounts of damage, and certainly more upfront damage than any AD carry could match. Karthus is a favourite of many teams around the world - Froggen used to love incorporating Karthus into a standard 'CLG.EU lategame' comp. Many more high DPS champions exist, such as Cassiopeia, Tryndamere, Jax, Jayce...the list goes on. 

So my question to you guys - what kind of comps could we see that don't incorporate AD carries? Bruiser Urgot used to be immensely popular, with Genja being the first to play it on an international level (Korean players had been loving Urgot for a long time). Doublelift employs a more damage-oriented Urgot build, focused on stacking AD and poking down opponents with Acid Hunter. We've even seen an Annie/Brand bot lane come out of KT Rolster B (granted, it was a diss against Frost, *but it worked*). 

Is the AD carry no longer a necessity? Is it no longer a role that we should tunnel on? ",,False,,t5_2wenn,False,,clg,True,t3_1a0rhv,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1a0rhv/forgoing_the_ad_carry_and_the_strengths_of_botrk/,

I know acer has already published a more refined article and I'm pretty late, but I'm here to practise my writing and get some feedback, and also demonstrate my knowledge. I am also aware that there will be similarities between our articles, but it is inevitable as both of these teams are very distinct and obvious in their strengths and weaknesses, so please be kind!

**SK Telecom T1 #2 vs MVP Ozone**

*Overview*

This is the semifinal no one saw coming. SK Telecom T1 (affectionately dubbed 'Judgment Day' by OGN casters DoA and MonteCristo) come into the match in their first ever Champions berth as an immensely ferocious and crowd-pleasing team. Declaring that they will be the first ever team to royal road Champions off the back of their superstar mid laner Faker, they come face-to-face with tournament underdogs MVP Ozone after an impressive win against the new Najin Shield squad, headed by Locodoco. 

The MVP side defied all expectations as they hounded CJ Entus Blaze, as well as group winner SK Telecom T1 #2 in Group A, going on to defeat tournament favourites KT Rolster B. The most impressive part of the MVP Ozone story is that KT Rolster B were alleged to have sandbagged games against CJ Entus Frost in order to not have to face Najin Sword in the round of 8 (the very team that knocked them out of last season's Champions). Hell hath no fury like an Imp scorned, it would seem, as Ozone lost one game to KT Rolster's traditional strong laning and early Baron plays, only to take three games in a row to close out the match and secure their right to face Judgment Day.

*Minimum Impact Gaming - Top Lane*

**Impact** and **Homme** represent Judgment Day and MVP Ozone respectively in the top lane. The term is a bit of a misnomer, however, as both teams are very fond of the lane swap that has become the core of the Korean metagame. This match-up is especially unusual as neither of the two players are regarded as world-class top laners (almost an expectation in Korea, where top lane juggernauts such as Shy, Flame, Expession, Reapered and Maknoon claim their home). 

Impact lives up to his name, delivering fantastic performances on Kennen and Jayce, while also being able to take a backseat with champions like Shen to let Faker work his magic. Although Korean teams often employ lane swaps, Impact has delivered fantastic performances mano-a-mano, utilising his previous experience as a jungler to predict ganks from the brush and dropping very few deaths in the laning phase. All-in-all, the Judgment Day top laner is a versatile, solid and reliable player who occasionally shows flashes of brilliance, putting the team on his back when they fall behind. 

Homme is perhaps the HotshotGG of Korea, as he often defaults to tanky melee champions with the role of peeling Imp's aggressors. Like Impact, Homme is a battle-hardened Shen player. However, the Korean metagame has shied away from Shen in recent weeks, and we may see similar tanky champions picked up by Homme such as Zac, Cho'gath or even Trundle, who after his rework has seen high amounts of play in the Korean solo queue ladder. The Kennen pick is also an option, as Homme elects to play Kennen in a more defensive role, using Slicing Maelstorm to stun those who would dare dive Imp.

Neither player is expected to dominate this match-up. Out of 100 games, Impact is more likely to have an advantage, but their playstyles clash against each other like shield on shield, and we can expect both players to fulfill their role for their team. 

*DanDy Unchained - Jungle*

Judgment Day's **bengi** and MVP Ozone's **DanDy** will head for the woods as their teams meet in the semifinal round. What is perhaps unusual is that both players have shown incredible mechanical and playmaking skills throughout their careers, but neither player has tapped into their innate abilities to a great extent during Champions. Indeed, the junglers in this match are often relegated to support roles, as both teams put their hopes on their carry players to close out games - specifically Faker for Judgment Day, and Imp for MVP Ozone. In the last round, bengi dominated NoFe as he ganked wherever the Najin Shield jungler wasn't, while DanDy had his hands full trying to deal with Korean All-Star inSec in the jungle. This game, the two initiate-heavy players will square off against each other as they finally have the opportunity to test their skills against a jungler of similar playstyle. 

bengi has played his role near-perfectly this season, giving Piglet and ManDu advantages in lane to push early towers and claim victory in the early-to-mid vision war. Favouring mobile junglers capable of chain ganking lanes like Jarvan IV, bengi will be looking to do much of the same in this match, trying to shut down the rampaging Imp, while also ensuring that Impact has the resources necessary to play whatever role Judgment Day requires of him. Interestingly, despite Faker being the centrepoint of Judgment Day, bengi has not paid many visits to enemy mid laners, only really appearing in the lane when he detects a possible gank against his teammate.

DanDy has struggled to achieve the form he had in previous iterations of Champions. In the past, the MVP Ozone jungler has been lauded as one of Korea's best junglers, hindered by weak teammates. This time around, his team is certainly far from weak, which brings into question whether he is actually as good as the public considers him to be. DanDy employs a 'jungle duel' mindset, favouring counterjungling, early ward clears, and counterganks as he attempts to support his team by mitigating the impact of the enemy jungler. Against bengi, DanDy will definitely have his hands full as he finally has the match-up where his strengths shine. However, his weaknesses are also easily exploitable by an explosive team like Judgment Day, as his lategame teamfight performance is not quite up to scratch, as well as the fact that without proper vision, DanDy tends to give up free kills. Expect DanDy to gravitate towards Lee Sin and Elise.

Other things being equal, this jungle match-up actually has the potential to swing the game massively in either direction. Judgment Day almost solely gains momentum off bengi's ganks, while MVP Ozone relies on DanDy to prolong the laning phase and give Imp as much free farm as is practical. bengi will set the tempo of the games, while DanDy will succeed if he matches bengi at every turn.

*Mother Faker Gentleman - Mid Lane*

The second-most anticipated match-up of the round of 4 isn't so because Judgment Day's **Faker** and MVP Ozone's **dade** are guaranteed to clash with each other in an explosion of farm and kills. The second-most anticipated match-up of the round of 4 is so because solo queue hero-cum-professional player Faker is involved. The young mid laner has dropped jaws and led many to question whether or not he is actually human. With an absolutely logic-defying performance on Leblanc and an uncanny ability to make plays on Twisted Fate no matter how lopsided the match-up, all eyes are on Faker in the upcoming games as the entire League of Legends community waits to see if the hype was warranted, or if he just got lucky.

Faker employs an explosive, highly aggressive playstyle in which he seeks to kill the other mid laner and apply pressure across the map. Although he seems less impressive when playing passively in a 1v2 lane (increasingly common as teams realise the threat he poses), he still pulls out from behind as he takes safe last hits to slowly become a threat in the lategame. Indisputably wielding the strongest mechanical skills out of all Champions mid laners, Faker's champion pool is also diverse, capable of picking both high poke champions like Jayce and Nidalee, and snowballing on assassins like Kha'zix and Leblanc. 

dade, like his jungler DanDy, has come into his own this season as he finally has a team able to match his mechanical ability and tactical genius. The MVP Ozone mid laner will likely not seek to take Faker in a contest of mechanics, as that is one of the few avenues Judgment Day will seek to take in order to topple the MVP side. Rather, he will try to outpush Faker and pressure other lanes with the use of Teleport on high CC champions like Diana. One of two star players on the old CJ Entus team, dade's playstyle is incredibly similar to Faker's, though he may pick less risky champions such as Lux or Ryze from time to time. 

In a vacuum, dade would not be able to put up the goods against rising star Faker. However, eight other players have to be factored into this match-up. As such, the performance of both mid laners will come down to how much they can push advantages around the map, rather than how far of a lead they can extend over their opponent. The games will be a learning experience for both players, as the winner must move on to face one of the CJ Entus mid laners, considered the best in Korea: either Frost cornerstone RapidStar, or Blaze All-Star Ambition.

*Mata In The Bank, impin Ain't Easy - Bottom Lane*

Superstar bottom lane meets superstar bottom lane as Judgment Day's **Piglet** and **(Pooh)ManDu** ready themselves for the onslaught of MVP Ozone's **imp** and **Mata**. Both bottom lanes have performed very well throughout champions, with consistent lane domination by Judgment Day's duo and explosive, if inconsistent play by MVP Ozone's bottom lane. They face off against each other for the second time this season, this time with greater pressure.

Piglet and ManDu have displayed praiseworthy synergy, with Pooh supporting Piglet with an innovative playstyle tempered with swaths of experience. Comparisons between Piglet and SK Telecom T1 #1's Raven (also imp's 'sister' AD carry) have been drawn, with both players favouring champions with weaker escapes and greater teamfighting ability such as Miss Fortune and Varus. Piglet also has a pocket Caitlyn that has been absolutely destructive when he has pulled it out. ManDu's picks will be unpredictable, though against Mata he will seek to take Sona and Thresh away, with the threat of more unorthodox picks like Leblanc and Fiddlesticks if they are not banned. Although not the shining stars of Judgment Day, Piglet's impeccable mechanics and Pooh's ban-drawing support play will seek to quell the imp hype and show the rest of the world that the Hundred-Acre Wood is Korea's most dangerous duo lane.

imp and Mata will draw the attention of viewers, as the AD carry of the duo has been nicknamed 'DoubleImp' by Korean fans due to his uncanny similarity to Doublelift in his ability to dominate games with near-impossible plays on Vayne (that arise, of course, from his tendency to get caught). The young talent of MVP Ozone is the core of their wider strategy of protecting and peeling. Mata is a reliable support player, who like ManDu enjoys seeking out kills and setting up ganks for the jungler. Also like ManDu, on a bad day, Mata looks very weak, diminishing imp's ability to carry. imp will be required to carry for MVP Ozone to win, seeking out hypercarries Vayne, Tristana and Kog'maw and only rarely deviating to more teamfight oriented picks like Varus. Mata's favourite Zyra may see play, but it is more likely that he will contest the top support pick in Korea: Sona.

*Overall Match-up*

Paradoxically, Judgment Day has the misfortune to play against the team that is most likely to counter their explosive, high-octane playstyle - the underdog team of the tournament, MVP Ozone. Like the CLG of days past, MVP Ozone's ability to turtle and leave the game in the hands of their superstar AD carry will prove a formidable stumbling block to Judgment Day and their desire to close out games early.

SK Telecom T1 #2 must:

* **Win the early game**. Without all three of Impact, Faker and Piglet amassing items, their lategame prospects against MVP Ozone are shaky at best. bengi will have to make sure DanDy does not hamper his efforts at giving advantages to the Judgment Day lanes.
*  **Bring the show to MVP Ozone**. Judgment Day absolutely cannot play to MVP Ozone's tune. They must control the tempo of the game and punish the weak objective control of their opponents.
* **Get Faker farmed**. dade and imp are immense threats to Judgment Day and if they cannot win in a shut-out, they must rely on Faker to make plays, or else they will be caught up in MVP Ozone's strong team coordination and lategame play.

MVP Ozone must:

* **Minimise early losses**. Judgment Day will force objectives, and attempt to put MVP Ozone on the backfoot. MVP Ozone must be comfortable with this, and have contingency plans for every early game scenario.
* **Protect imp with their lives**. The dive threat of Impact, bengi and Faker is reminiscent of the triple threat of KT Rolster B and their uncanny ability to reduce any AD carry to tears. Homme, DanDy and Mata must be on full alert as they attempt to guard imp and allow him to carry.
* **Play their roles**. Unlike Judgment Day, MVP Ozone cannot afford to have a single player slack off, as their compositions are centred around one or two players. Homme must be the defensive juggernaut, DanDy must not fall behind, while dade and imp absolutely must farm to the best of their abilities, to the point where they have to take jungle camps and empty lane farm to stay even or ahead of Faker and Piglet.

*Predictions*

Any outcome could occur, it comes down to how the teams perform on the day, as on paper it is impossible to judge whether one team's strengths can overpower the other's. In a set of 5, I believe that SK Telecom T1 #2 will win, but the nerves of their young players may get to them if MVP Ozone clutch an early lead.

My prediction is 3:0 in favour of SK Telecom T1 #2. ",,False,,t5_2wenn,False,,clg,True,t3_1f9c0r,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1f9c0r/olympus_champions_spring_2013_semifinal_preview/,

1364033415.0,32,self.summoners,1aupnt,"CLG this week (not a trash talk thread, reposted from /r/leagueoflegends)",49,17,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1aupnt/clg_this_week_not_a_trash_talk_thread_reposted/,"I'd first like to mention that this is not intended to be a CLG bash thread, in fact, quite the opposite.


CLG failed this week. There's no other way to put it. They lost all of their games, and seem as though they're a contender to fall out of the top 4, and fall out of the top 4 HARD. Their problems seem to arise from them refusing to play new champions aside from Link and a bit from chauster (though, to be hinest, neither of them have been carrying the team as hard as doublelift had been doing last season, which is perhaps to be expected). Personally, I think there are a few solutions, or outcomes, depending what they choose, or choose not, to change.


First, let's talk about hotshot. He's an amazing player, I believe he can keep up with other top lane players in NA. However, to say he's innovative would just be foolish. Yes, he tried the karthus top lane this weekend, and it worked out okay overall (failed one game, worked surprisingly well the next). However, the karthus top is more of a gimmick than anything. I don't think it's something that can genuinely be continued to be used effectively. Anywasy, back on track. What hotshot needs yo do (imo etc), is one of two things. The first idea, which is my preferred idea, is get a bigger champion pool. His nidalee is amazing, but she is either banned or the enemy team picks it vs them. Also, the type of nidalee he likes to play was nerfed quite hard with the resistances being taken off her cougar form. Further, we all know he can play certain tanks, and he had a lot of success playing these certain tanks in season 2. However, the time has come where either pure tanks are no longer a viable option in the top lane, or his style of playing tanks is no longer as dominant as it once was. Essentially, he needs a bigger champ pool. The karthus idea was on the right track, let's hope it keeps rolling.


The other idea to fix the hotshot problem, is simply to bench him, have him become a sub or a coach. The problem with this is that he will have a lot less of an importance in league of legends, which affects both sides of the coin; Personally, I love watching him perform when he does well, and it seems that the people who aren't his biggest fans, love to hate on him even more. I believe hotshot has a place in the league of legends professional scene, I'm just no longer sure if it's playing for a team if he's not willing to change SOMETHING about his play. I don't want to see him go, but something needs to happen.


Second, I'd like to talk about CLG's bot lane. This isn't so much centered around aphro, though, as I think most people would agree that, although he is new to the roll, he has been doing a good enough job that he isn't having a huge negative effect on his team. Yes, he's gotten caught a few times, but who hasn't? So, on to doublelift. This past weekend must have been one of the most painful for him. He likes to trash talk (though to me, and maybe I'm just a doublelift fanboy, it seems to all be in jest), and that somewhat backfired when someone took something he said a bit too personally. Now, I'm not saying anything for sure, but something like that could have had an effect on his gameplay for the other two games they played this week. Although he did pretty well against V, as long as teams ban out his vayne, he doesn't seem to be able to carry CLG as hard as he could one year ago, even when they need it most.
So, what does he do to change? Obviously I would never suggest he needs to be benched; although these past few weeks have hit him hard, before then, most people wouldn't have denied that he was one of the best ADCs in the world. Now with even his fans with some doubt that he's as dominent as he once was, what does he need to do to regain our faith? Well, he seems to have said it best himself; he needs to, too, expand his champion pool (https://twitter.com/CLGDoublelift/status/315279720541474816). Now, you might be thinking, ""hey, didn't he say that all of the ADCs he doesn't play are garbage?"" and if so, you're right. He's said many times that the champs without escape mechanisms (excluding twitch and kog) will not be viable against good teams. Though, after being stomped by these champs, and perhaps swallowing a bit of pride (err, maybe a lot of pride), he seems to have changed his mind.
Now, finally, onto the rest of CLG. First, we can start with chauster. Before he was their jungler, he was probably the best support in the world (at the time of course, I'm sure there is a 10 page document of Asian supports that are better than him now). The transition to jungle seems to have been a weird one for him. He's come up with a decent amount of innovative strats, which are fantastic, which is exactly what CLG seems to need. However, like in season 2, he seems to want to jump on doublelift's back and have him carry him to the top. Don't get me wrong, in season 2, chauster did everything you could want from a support and a shot caller. However, now in S3, where carry junglers are more dominant, he seems to continue to want to play the support jungler role, which is perhaps already filled by hotsot in top lane. Hopefully either him or hotshot can eventually become another source of damage for the team, rather than both of them being another source of CC for the team.
Of the remaining 2, link seems to be the only one left to mention, as I've already said something about aphro. When link joined the team, I think everyone was very hopeful that he would be able to fill jiji's role in skill, but also be able to fill the void that jiji left, meaning having a mid laner that would have an impact on more than just mid lane. This isn't a bash to jiji, obviously, as I love him to death. The point is, though, that link hasn't been able to fill that roaming void. Yes, in CLG's past game vs V, he did play Katarina with TP, which had a great impact on the game overall, and he did a decent job roaming when needed as well. However, one game does not make up for a month of not really disapointment, but more of the same problem that jiji was having. However, I find it hard to say that it was somply the same problem that jiji was having, as link is innovative and has shown us that he is willing to pull out different champs on occasion (I think, apart from MAYBE voyboy, this was the first game that CLG played katarina).


Well, that about sums up my overlook of the current CLG situation. Personally I don't think that there needs to be any immediate roster changes (though admittedly, hotshot leaving top lane has a decent amount of potential), but there needs to be immediate changes period. SOMETHING has to change. Doubelift has started the train, and maybe this past game of CLGs will start something, since they had moderate success with the katarina and karthus picks.

As a huge CLG fan, I just want them to win. Please, and hopefully I can speak for most fans of league of legends in general, CHANGE SOMETHING.",,False,,t5_2wenn,False,,,True,t3_1aupnt,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1aupnt/clg_this_week_not_a_trash_talk_thread_reposted/,

(x-post from /r/leagueoflegends),53,26,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1f10ho/the_league_of_legends_community_needs_some_rules/,"Apologies in advance for the wall of text, as I feel very strongly about this topic. I brought it here for some (hopefully) more intelligent discussion about the issue, and maybe I can learn something.

As a content creator, the amount of unethical practices in the league of legends subreddit has bothered me for a long time, but this weekend we've seen it at a ridiculous level for all of the all star clips floating around. The thing that really grinds my gears is that people screencap from pro/tournament streams and upload them to personal YouTube channels, monetizing the clips. This means that they are personally making money by taking other people's content. The streamer/tournament gets none of that ad revenue, and often these clips contain copyrighted content (i.e. music).

So why does this matter? As a fledgling industry still, eSports can only be successful as long as some semblance of professionalism exists. For an example, look at all of the backlash from the fighting game community. A large portion of the community has pushed against the advent of their hobby as an ""eSport"" instead holding on to their roots. Their refusal to change their behavior can clearly be seen by the lower sponsorship, new viewership, and public opinion of their games compared to other large eSports. The behavior of the community has a very quantifiable effect on public perception of the sport, and one need look no further than the CapCom livestream fiasco where even more conventional media outlets took notice not of the thriving community behind the sport but rather the practices condoned by their leadership which many would consider unacceptable.

When our community engages in practices that are unethical, we actively cripple ourselves from reaching our potential. Frankly, uploading clips without permission from the content creator is nothing less than stealing, and making money from stolen material is punishable in real life outside the wild west mentality that exists still on the Internet.

More importantly, this is an issue that can easily be fixed with some awareness and integrity from our community. The VODs for LCS, for example, are available very soon after the event and often during the event itself on YouTube. People who want that precious karma can simply link to a timestamp in the video rather than uploading it their own channels. That way, the views/ad revenue still go to the people who are really responsible for the content being created, and tournaments can see more attention and return on their events, which in turn benefit us all. Twitch vods can be similarly linked by adding t=xxmxxs at the end of the url, and the attention/revenue for the clip would again go to the streamer who made it.

Currently, the front page has been inundated with clips from LCS All Stars, and I've seen some 80-90% of them monetized by the uploader. For some examples, see here:

[1] http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1f0vz3/pdd_quadrakill_against_garena_all_stars_team_video/

[2] http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1f0r5f/theu_eu_allstars_almost_pulled_a_xpeke/

[3] http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1f0t6r/all_star_doublelift_pentakill_video/

[4] http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1f0qv5/na_vs_eu_first_team_fight_at_dragon/

If you go to the videos themselves, you'll find either in stream ads or banner ads, and you can see where they are applied in the video by the yellow bars in the time map.

I love that at the click of a button I can see doublelift pentakill the EU team, but as you can see, I can just link as so: [5] http://www.youtube.com/user/LoLChampSeries?v=pzNYdkev18o&amp;t=4h42m17s and offer the exact same content without stealing it from its rightful owner. A good example of this currently on the front page is the following submission from qtpie's stream which is a timestamp from his VODS: [6] http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1ezqpn/imaqtpie_nunu_pentakill/. It still shows the great play but any monetization of the video goes to qtpie, who made the stream to begin with.

I know this has turned into a wall of text over an issue that is probably not that important to most people, but as a person who loves eSports and wants it to grow as well as a recreational video creator, it is abhorrent for me to see this unethical behavior condoned and let it damage the entire community when it can so easily be rectified. Please discuss in the comments below and hopefully we can make this community better with our actions.

tl;dr Uploading and then monetizing content from streams is unethical, and the community can easily rectify this practice with some awareness and action.

###I. Teamfight Breakdown

###[[IMAGES] Full Teamfight Analysis](http://imgur.com/a/1EEoe)

The images above breakdown the entirety of the teamfight. In the sections below, we will take an even deeper look at 2 key concepts that heavily influenced this fight.
___
###II. Key Concept: Choke Point Control

Zac's excellent initiation into the middle of GGU created a split, trapping Riven and Elise inside the dragon pit. At this point, DIG's main focus should have been to preserve GGU's split positioning through choke point control. Due to their narrow nature, choke points are generally the easiest locations in which to create a zone, an area of control that enemies cannot move through because of CC or damage threat. More spacious areas require a proper team positioning to control, but narrow chokes typically require just a single player to create a zone. Thus, the dragon choke point was an integral point of control in this teamfight.

Yet, creating the zone and maintaining it are two different things. Positioning in chokes is generally disadvantageous, mostly due to the increased susceptibility to enemy skillshots and AOE, so it is usually difficult to control a choke point for an extended time. 

Furthermore, even with zone control, it is not always easy to take advantage of a split. In most scenarios, teams that are split can simply take a circuitous route and regroup. Though this wastes time, it is oftentimes not enough for the enemy to take advantages off it.

**The Dragon Choke**

The unique characteristics of the dragon choke, however, combat these problems, making the choke an ideal location to control and abuse enemy split positioning:

* **Dimensions** - The dragon choke has almost no length, giving a player in the choke far more diagonal movement than most chokes. It is also wider than most chokes, so it is wide enough for a single player to maneuver laterally, while still being narrow enough for the player to cover it easily. 

* **The Pit** - The dragon and baron pits have just 1 exit. Therefore, controlling the dragon choke traps players, making it much easier to create advantages off split positioning.

**Abusing Split Positioning**

From [23:15] onward, choke point control was a key factor in this fight. In addition to splitting GGU, Zac's initiation chunked Elise heavily, giving DIG enough threat to control the dragon choke. At [23:16], DIG had obtained control of the choke, with Zac in position to enforce the zone. It was then time to take advantage of GGU's split. 

The first objective for DIG should have been to split GGU further, keeping Zac at the dragon choke while moving the other 4 members aggressively toward the GGU carries. With the numbers disadvantage and a lack of tanks, GGU would have been forced back. The light blue and pink arrows in the image at [23:16] show the movements DIG should have made and how GGU would have been forced to respond. If done in a proper fashion, they could then turn freely onto the GGU players trapped in the pit before the GGU carries could react and regroup.

However, DIG locked their focus onto the low HP Elise instead, even though she still had rappel. As the DIG tanks moved down into the pit, they lost choke point control. This allowed Riven to easily flash past them at [23:18] and establish choke control for GGU instead. With DIG now separated by the choke point, GGU focused the DIG carries with the numbers advantage, winning the teamfight.
___
###III. Key Concept: Tank Lines

Competitive LoL has progressed greatly from the days where, even among the best teams, carries would routinely rush into teamfights in front of their tanks. However, while such simple mistakes are no longer made, top teams still sometimes fail to position well with respect to their tank line in more complex situations.

The main goal of tanks is to protect the squishier carries, allowing them to survive and maximize their damage output. The tanks accomplish this by staying in front of their carries, which allows them to zone, preventing enemies from moving past them and getting to the carries, and block, stopping enemy skillshots from hitting their carries.

**Maintaining Tank Lines**

Throughout this teamfight, DIG failed to adapt their tank line to the split positioning of GGU. DIG only maintained their tank line against one side of GGU's split, opening up the other flank to free CC and damage. 

At [23:14], Zac had created a tank line against the GGU carries, but there was nothing protecting DIG against the GGU members in the pit. However, DIG was focused on following up with Zac. Thus, for the second time in the teamfight, Twisted Fate was caught with poor positioning, and was caught by an Elise stun. Meanwhile, GGU spread themselves out well, giving Ezreal the opening to chunk TF through the 1 man tank line. Without a tank line for the GGU members in the pit, TF should have prioritized safety, moving to the top of the river. However, the GGU carries were the far more apparent targets, causing TF to focus only on them.

At [23:16], DIG had an excellent tank line set up against both flanks, with Zac zoning the GGU members stuck in the pit, and Lee Sin forming the line between the GGU carries. However, this was just a transitional moment. DIG had simply noticed how low the seemingly trapped Elise was, and were all moving down into the pit. With the tank line broken at [23:18] the GGU carries were able to flank and split the DIG carries from the tanks, focusing them down with ease. Furthermore, TF once again did not keep proper positioning with the respect to where the tank line was, and was instantly bursted down by Riven.",,False,,t5_2wenn,False,,,True,t3_1draci,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1draci/teamfight_breakdown_ggu_vs_dig_dragon_teamfight/,

The two scenes I pay attention to are the NA scene and the Korean scene. I've noticed in many interviews how each team describes their training regimen, where they scrim and watch replays 10 - 12 hours a day, but still they are considered the weakest region. A lot of people say how NA has a lot of 'catching' up to do and it's almost impossible at this rate to be as good as the Asians. Even concerning the LCS Qualifiers, I've seen several people of the opinion that the LCS will eventually become monopolized by all the experienced teams. Now, I believe that League of Legends is a very overrated skill gap. Obviously, more experienced teams have the advantage, but the gap is grossly overestimated by most of the community. Before, NA used to be the most experienced and best scene. How did Korea and China go from being the weakest region to the strongest so quickly? How come NA has been stuck at the bottom of the ladder when they practice so much every day? A good example is IEM Cologne where Sk Telecom beat Fnatic in the finals. SK Telecom was literally a team for about a month. This was also when Fnatic was on their hot streak and resurgence to fame beating all the top teams only to lose to a team still in it's infancy. Another good example is OGN, where literally all these newly sponsored teams are coming out beating veterans with many wins already right at the start of the tournament. I feel like any team has the potential to upset, and the LCS teams shouldn't remain stagnant, there will always be fresh teams if they put in enough effort. I don't know what it is though, how come these foreign teams can improve so quickly, while NA always seems to be left behind? Once again, I don't think the problem is that the skill gap is too large, or that NA doesn't practice enough, there has to be something with the way they practice or something they are missing from their schedule that is separating them from rising to the top again. Feel free to post your theories as I am curios to hear other people's opinion on this.",,False,,t5_2wenn,False,,Riven,True,t3_1ct98u,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1ct98u/discussion_nas_training_regimenskill_gaps/,

Hoping someone here could give me some insight/clarify somethings as to whether or not this would be a good idea. Sorry if it's somewhat of a vent. Let me know what the issues are with it.


**Tl;dr** Ranked 5 Match making should incorporate **BOTH INDIVIDUAL MMR as well as TEAM MMR** in order to avoid ridiculously imbalanced team match ups. 

Hey everyone,


I just wanted to take a moment to explain my thoughts about the Ranked 5's system. I have been playing LoL since the release of Kennen (April 2010), so I have seen almost every single significant change made in this game. I always enjoyed ranked, even if I never played enough of it to try and get to a higher teir, mostly because I would be trio or 4 man arranging with my friends. With the change to the league system, Myself and my friends decided to really go at it this season to see what we could get by way of ranked 5s. We already had a team from the last seasons so we just stuck with that.


We initially did pretty well in our placements coming out with a 4W2L ratio. We were placed in Silver 3, which was some odd to us because the season previous we were high silver almost gold. Nevertheless, we started playing and decided to crack out as many wins as we could to get us up to Gold or higher, just to see what we were able to accomplish. We played a handful of games and got to our Silver 3 promotion series with no losses at the time. Things were looking up and we just shrugged off the low placement.


To give you an idea, each member of our team is Silver 1 moving up to Gold. 


The first team we faced in our promotion series utterly crushed us. It was a team with nothing but diamonds, Jungie who was in challenger at the time and a single gold tier player. here's a [Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/QWpFGEa.jpg). We were dumbfounded, but we moved on. We played against a team of all silvers as our MMR had dropped and we beat them by a significant margin. Our next match was against a team of Plats and Diamond players. They crushed us.


We were annoyed and bummed that we had been matched with people that were so much better than us, but we played again. We were able to get back into the promotion series where we met another silver team, but then more Diamonds and Plats. We dropped down back out of promotion. We played another game (with a 10W6L record) and played against [this team](http://i.imgur.com/p3w1ucu.jpg). Anyone recognize that Graves player? Though we were able to win, we were all still completely blown away by these Match ups we were getting. Now we're back into the promotion series and our first match up should have quite a few Well-known names in it. [See if you recognize anyone on this team](http://i.imgur.com/ctous3l.jpg).


My point is, Our team is full of Silver 1 players, we're ranked Silver 3 in teams, and we have an 11W8L ratio. WHY ARE WE GETTING MATCHED WITH PLAT AND DIAMOND LEVEL TEAMS? I understand that there is a different MMR for Teams and Solo Queue, and that is why were are getting matched, but that is the problem. There is NO REASON we should be playing against these types of teams. As much as I would love to say I am Diamond 2 and 1 material, I am not anywhere near that good.


So what should be done? How can Ranked 5s be made fun without the burden of being matched with teams that have ridiculously higher skilled players than yours? IT'S SIMPLE REALLY. All that would need to be done would be to incorporate individual MMR as well as Team MMR into the Match making process. You match people/teams of Diamond and Plat level ratings and skills against other people/teams with that kind of skill. You can make it broader to reduce the limited number of teams in higher brackets. All it would take is to make Bronze, Silver, and Gold Tier players play against teams with nothing but Bronze, Silver, and Gold tier players. Plat, Diamond, and Challenger can play against other plats, diamonds, and Challengers.


This method would allow teams of lower skill to actually be able to advance through even the lowest of divisions and tiers without having to play 50+ games together to have their MMR settle out with a negative Win/Loss ratio. Once you get to the top of Gold, you would play promotions against Gold/Plat player teams. When you cross that threshold, you then are into the next Bracket of Team play and get to work on Advancing higher and gaining that MMR.

1365846290.0,28,self.summoners,1c9gf8,NA LCS &amp; The Race for the Top in Week 10...,30,2,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1c9gf8/na_lcs_the_race_for_the_top_in_week_10/,"With the penultimate week of the NA LCS down the fierce battle to stay out of those bottom 2 slots, guaranteeing a spot in the Promotion/Relegation Tournament, is still pretty close between half the ladder (with CLG only at risk if they have an amazingly terrible final week). But the coveted top 2 spots may just come down to the last few games of the season...  

With the only 2 wins separating 1st and 3rd and every team having to play 5 matches in the last week it should make to be an interesting watch. What's even more interesting is the chances of a tie situation are more than likely especially with Dignitas &amp; TSM both sitting on the same score and both all but certain of a handful of wins.  

Here's what the LCS Rulebook has to say about tie-breaking the ladder:
&gt; **7.3.2 Regular Season Tiebreaker.**
 
&gt;In the event that two teams are tied in the standings at the conclusion of either Regular Season split (as defined as having the same winning percentage), then any teams so tied will be seeded by head-to-head record. If said teams have identical head-to-head records (as defined as each team winning 50% of games between the two teams), said teams will play one tiebreaker game to determine the final standings.

&gt;Tiebreaker games will be played following the final day of the Regular Season, but prior to the first day of the Playoffs. Tied teams will compete against each other until there is a winner.

&gt;If three or more teams are tied, the teams will play full round-robins (involving best-of-one matches) until the determination of a hierarchical non-tied result is made.

&gt;Side selection for all tiebreaker games will be determined by a coin flip.  

The interesting take away there is that the 'Head-To-Head' record between Dig &amp; TSM is 2-1, which means the last match of the Spring LCS that both of them play (against each other no less) may decide who scrapes in.

IF TSM/Dignitas tie for 2nd/3rd place but Dig wins that match then they maintain their lead in the Head-to-Head record and retain 2nd place, but if TSM wins that match and both teams tie the season they also tie their Head-to-Head (2-2) which means the fight continues and both teams have to show up on Saturday for a tiebreaker game.  

  
  




...of course if they don't tie the season then all of this is redundant and doesn't matter, but it's still interesting!  

PS: It's also theoretically possible (but less likely) that Curse might tie with one of the two, in which case their H2H records look like:  

Curse 2:2 TSM

Curse 2:1 DIG (With 1 last game to be played in Week 10)

The problem with this is that different champions value different stats so this doesn't tell you how efficient an item is on a specific champion.

A more accurate way of calculating item value is to use damage gained per kilogold. First you calculate the damage of a champion with runes and masteries. This is your baseline. Then calculate the damage with items. Find the difference between your item damage and your baseline damage multiply by 1000 and divide by the cost of your items. 

The reason you use kilogold instead of gold is because using damage gained per gold gives you too small of numbers. Higher values of Δdmg/kgold means more efficient items.

---

Here's an example using a lvl 13 Ashe with 21 offense and flat AD runes. (I'm ignoring armor because neither build will have a LW).

base damage = 96.35 AD * 1.00 Attacks/second = 96.35 dps

damage with BT = 196.35 AD * 1.00 = 196.35 dps


**BT Δdmg/kgold = (196.35 - 96.35) * 1000 / 3200 = 31.25 Δdmg/kgold**

damage with IE = [166 * 0.75 + 166 * 0.25 * 2.55] * 1.0 = 230 dps

**IE Δdmg/kgold = (230 - 96) * 1000 / 3800 = 37.9 Δdmg/kgold**

BT + dagger + dagger = 196 * 1.15 = 225 dps.

**BT + 2xdagger Δdmg/kgold = (225 - 96) * 1000 / 4000 = 32 Δdmg/kgold**

This shows what most people already know. A BT is slightly less gold efficient than an IE if you are focusing purely on maximizing autoattack damage.

1372207700.0,28,self.summoners,1h2r8r,An idea to remove Thresh from the ~100% pick/ban list (x-post from /r/leagueoflegends),47,19,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1h2r8r/an_idea_to_remove_thresh_from_the_100_pickban/,"This is an expansion of a[ comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1gzguc/ezreal_meets_the_box/capitut) I made earlier. *You do not need to read that comment to understand this post as I will reiterate what I have previously stated.*

Since Thresh was announced approximately 6 months ago people have said that he would be at the top of the list of ~100% pick/ban champions. Most shrugged this off as almost every champion appears to be OP before they are released and that this new champion would be no different, but there is no denying the power of Thresh. He has enough CC in his kit to stop a rampaging Hecarim, and is one of the few champions that is able to continue to scale (without items) after he hits level 18. However, these things are not what makes Thresh such a sought after pick. He has the ability to set up ganks and save teammates like nobody in the league before him thanks to his trademark lantern. On top of all this, he has an attack range of 425 that allows him to harass the enemy ad fairly safely in lane. Since his abilities themselves are strong because of their effects and not because of the insane amounts of damage  or the free stats they provide to a team it is extremely hard to balance because tweaking numbers will do nothing to stop him.

The only real ways you can nerf abilities like these are by reducing their range, increasing their cooldown, or increasing their mana cost. I feel that range nerfs are easiest way to destroy a champion. Usually, it does little to stop the problems that required the ability to be nerfed, and it just annoys everybody who has played the champion prior (ask Diana players about patch 1.0.0.153). Thresh's cooldowns are long enough in lane to allow you to react to him if he misuses an ability, so a cooldown nerf will also do little to change his laning or presence in fights. Of these three options, mana cost nerfs would probably be the Riot's best bet at reducing his ability to make plays happen in lane. While this might make him less contested in lower divisions of solo queue, in higher divisions and in competitive play, where players know how to manage high mana costs and can consistently land skill shots, he would almost definitely remain in the 100% pick ban list.

At this point in the post you might be thinking to yourself ""But Nostalgia37, what's the big deal if there are a few champions that are picked or banned in almost every game? There are 114 champions. It is near impossible for Riot to balance the game completely so some champions will be stronger than others"" While I do agree that it is unavoidable that some champions will simply be better than others, having champions that are being picked or banned in almost every game is not healthy for the game. It removes a lot of diversity from the game and, on both a competitive and personal level, makes the game much more boring.  Furthermore, the game is getting close to the point where the team who is smarter during the picks and bans phase will win the majority of their games. If this is how the game is meant to be played at a professional level, which I believe it is, then Riot must  allow competitive teams to spend their bans on champions that their opponents play well and not force them to ban champions that are insanely OP.

Getting back to the point of this topic, Thresh is able to dominate the laning phase through the displacement abilities in his kit and his ability to constantly harass the enemy AD with his auto attack while being able to easily transition into late game thanks to his passive, there is no point in the game where you can take advantage of Thresh. Since nerfing his abilities is almost impossible we need to look towards the two other things that he is able to do.  For those who don’t know, Thresh’s passive lets him collect the souls of enemies that his team has slain. These souls give Thresh bonus armor and ability power, with the value of each soul diminishing as Thresh fills up his lantern. What some people may not know is that, depending on the level of Thresh’s E ability, Flay, souls give him bonus magic damage on his auto attacks. This bonus damage increases the longer Thresh does not attack with a base damage of the number of souls Thresh has collected. This would be alright if Thresh was a melee ranged character and had to work to get that auto attack in, but with his 425 range he can, and will, hit you like a truck whenever you try to cs. Since his all-in is so strong because of his massive amounts of cc he should not be able to zone so well. This was similar to Kha’zix problem (although not to the same extent), he was able to poke people down before jumping in and bursting them down. Since the changes made to Kha’zix in patch 3.8, where they reduced his evolved W damage, he has almost fallen off of the map. So it would seem obvious that his ability to zone in lane would be the best thing to target the nerf bat at while still keeping the feel of the champion intact. 

While it would be possible to nerf Thresh’s base stats so that he would be vulnerable when he goes in to land an auto attack, or so that he would deal less damage with each auto attack, this is not the best way to tackle this problem. If he were to have his hp and base armor lowered then he would be less willing to go all in once he lands a death sentence and he would feel like a much different champion. If his base AD or attack speed was lowered, this would do little for his auto attack dps since the majority of his AA damage comes from his souls. Rather than remove the passive on flay, or lower the amount of damage he gets from it I propose that the chance of souls spawning from a slain enemy be reduced. 

If souls were less common then it would mean that he gets a lower base damage bonus on his AA and that he is much less tanky later in the game. This would also make it more important for thresh to pick up every soul in lane and would give him the option of going out of position, where the enemy could capitalize, using his lantern cooldown to collect the soul, and relieve some pressure on the enemy, or not collect the soul at all, and miss out on stats for the late game. This would make his mid game much weaker and would allow for some more counter play to a champion that lacks any apparent weaknesses.

TL;DR Lower the chance of souls dropping.

###I. Introduction

Without gameplay mistakes, matches in the competitive LoL scene would be largely decided before the games even started, in the pick and ban phase. But of course, all teams make mistakes, and these mistakes are almost always the main determinants of the outcome of a certain play or game. Yet, there are exceptions:

In the 3rd game of TS vs DIG in the NA LCS Summer Promotion, TS grabbed an early lead through nearly flawless play. The catalyst for the advantages they gained was not a major gameplay mistake by DIG, as is typically the case, but rather from the team compositions. DIG played well in their own right, but excellent strategic play allowed TS to start a snowball of their picks that DIG was helpless to stop. Unfortunately, TS was unable to keep up their level of play, creating openings that DIG expertly pounced on to turn the game around.

In this analysis, we will examine the amazing strategic play of TS in the first 10 minutes of the game, as well as the point at which TS began to falter. We begin in section II by studying the team compositions that gave TS their initial advantage. Section III presents the in-depth gameplay analysis in a timeline of images, after which the key ideas and events are then summarized in section IV. We end with some short final thoughts in section V.

###II. Team Compositions

**Team Comps**

**DIG:** **Jayce** (KiWiKiD), **Rammus** (Crumbzz), **Ryze** (scarra), **Ezreal** (imaqtpie), **Zyra** (Patoy)

**TS:** **Shen** (Grim Samurai), **Nasus** (Sickoscott), **Syndra** (CaptainKorea), **Varus** (otter), **Sona** (L0CUST)

**Draft Order:** Ezreal -&gt; Shen/Sona -&gt; Jayce/Zyra -&gt; Nasus/Varus -&gt; Rammus/Ryze -&gt; Syndra

Throughout their relegation matches, TS displayed an excellent understanding of map pressure. They complemented that strength in this game with a team comp that excelled in providing and preventing pressure. With this in mind, let's examine the important picks:

* **Shen/Nasus:** This top/jungle combo has great tower holding potential against an AD/support combo; Nasus has strong wave clear and Shen creates strong threat with his taunt.

* **Varus/Sona:** This combo has great harass and solid wave clear from Varus, allowing them to push towers quickly in a 2v1.

The above 4 picks are typical of recent TSM compositions, especially in the playoff finals. Like TS, TSM has a much stronger understanding of map pressure than most NA teams and complements this strength with their picks. To this end, TSM picks a comp that is well-rounded in all aspects, but has especially strong early game pressure.

A common TSM comp in the last weeks of the LCS was something like this: 

* Top: Rumble/Renekton 
* Jungle: Nasus/Cho'gath 
* Mid: Diana/Twisted Fate
* AD: Caitlyn/Varus
* Support: Sona/Thresh. 

The key roles in this comp are the jungler and AD/support. The jungler must have strong wave clear and the AD/support must have strong tower pushing capabilities. The top and mid roles are more flexible, but should have at least decent wave clear and tower holding ability. Ideally, TSM can create an advantageous lane swap scenario, in which the jungler then prioritizes towers over jungle farm and alleviates pressure from the enemy AD/support lane, while the AD/support lane heavily pressures the enemy turret. The goal is to gain an early tower advantage, which they use to snowball.

As you can see, the TS team comp holds these traits, and as you will see, it is run in the same manner. However, it was the last picks that allowed TS to gain an overwhelming team comp advantage and create strong early game pressure:

* **Rammus:** This pick was the main determinant of the early game. TS' early strategy focused on punishing 2 key weaknesses of Rammus: (1) he is relatively blue dependent and (2) he has poor wave clear. TS knew they could cripple his jungle with early blue control and easily get a tower advantage with a 2v1 swap, given the wave clear difference between Nasus and Rammus.

* **Syndra:** This pick shows how TS adapted their focus to Rammus. Not only does Syndra have solid wave clear that allows her to pressure well, especially against a Ryze, but her toss is great for the early blue invade, which they clearly planned from the start with this pick.

TS left mid open in order to counter pick, and they did so extremely well, adapting directly to the Rammus pick. After the last 3 picks of the draft phase, TS clearly has a far better ability to manipulate creep waves and create pressure. In the next section, we will see how they snowballed this advantage.

###III. In-Depth Analysis

The following image timeline constitutes the crux of this analysis:

###[[Images] In-Depth Analysis](http://imgur.com/a/jU8eD#0)


The main factor for TS' early game advantage was not a gameplay mistake by DIG, but simply a matter of a team comp advantage and a nearly flawless understanding and execution of strategic concepts to snowball the advantage, which is what makes this early game play so excellent. The 3 main things to note about TS' play are:

1. **Seamless Transitioning** - There was essentially no wasted time throughout the early game with TS' extremely smooth transitioning, allowing them to maximize the efficiency of their snowball.

2. **Map Pressure Recognition** - TS applied and responded to pressure very well, allowing them to create advantages without relying on mistakes from DIG.

3. **Priority Awareness** - TS understood the relative importance of different objectives and made sure they were always taking full advantage of the best opportunities.

Because of the nearly flawless play, it is easy to map out the TS-controlled early game in a snowballing chain of events:

Blue Control -&gt; Tower Control -&gt; Dragon -&gt; Blue Control -&gt; Tower Control

After DIG was caught off guard by the invade, the first 2 links in this chain were essentially guaranteed by the team comp advantage alone. In the events afterwards, TS snowballed off openings that DIG were helpless to stop; while DIG could have prevented the exact series of events from happening, some vulnerabilities were bound to pop up as a result of the first 2 events, no matter what they did.

The next section will summarize each of the events and put the information from above into context, but the images are the ""in-depth"" portion of the analysis.

###IV. Summary

**Step 1: Blue Control**

By taking control of both buffs, TS crippled Rammus for the first 4 minutes of the game. The loss of experience and cooldown reduction from the blue buff slowed his level 3 gank and forced him to take extra damage. At low HP and having no wave clear, Rammus could neither gank nor relieve any pressure top by the time he reached lvl 3.

The most impressive part of this play was the transition after the steal. Though they committed all 5 to the blue steal, none of the TS lanes were impacted. Shen was the only one late to lane, but it did not matter in the 2v1 match up. TS showed their understanding of priorities and pressure, rushing to secure the second blue with Shen, who would have otherwise just stood in lane getting denied.

**Step 2: Tower Control**

By crippling Rammus, TS made an already strong tower pushing advantage even stronger. Once again, TS displayed great understanding of priorities, using Nasus to hold tower instead of clearing the red buff. Thanks to Shen's earlier help, Nasus transitioned to the tower as the creep wave hit, maximizing experience and gold while minimizing tower damage. After taking top tower, TS wasted no time, pushing in and transitioning bot.

**Step 3: Dragon**

Again, TS showed great pressure and priority awareness. Seeing Jayce freeze top, TS used the lack of pressure to take a free dragon.

**Step 4: Buff Control**

This is where TS really began to shine. With dragon gone, there were no clear objectives and Jayce was still freezing top. However, TS remained completely unfazed. Shen and Nasus simply cleared the jungle and then pushed mid with a numbers advantage. This pressure pinned Ryze to the turret and also caused Jayce to stop freezing his lane. With Ryze stuck at turret, TS stole the second blue buff. They then transitioned back to natural lanes and secured their own blue, losing nothing and making full use of their time.

TS' excellent recognition of map pressure opportunities created a blue steal opportunity while simultaneously stopping the top lane freeze. Instead of falling victim to farm denial in the frozen lane, TS punished DIG for the lack of pressure it created.

**Step 5: Tower Control**

TS continued their amazing play, seizing the opportunity to push mid after Ryze recalled. With bot lane under control, TS sent Sona mid after backing instead of returning bot. Meanwhile, Nasus already transitioned mid and got free damage onto the turret. The pressure caused DIG to gank, but TS was completely prepared with Sona and Shen ult. Though Shen ulted in unnecessarily, TS simply adapted and used it to start a legitimate push onto the mid turret, which they grabbed easily.

TS' choice to send Sona mid is the epitome of their incredible early game play. TS didn't just take advantage of openings in DIG's play, they punished those openings to the fullest. Just realizing the opening and sending Nasus to push was already a great play, but sending Sona made it amazing. TS realized the map pressure situation and knew they could send Sona mid without losing much bot, letting them take full advantage off a small opening.

**Step 6: Dragon**

Here, TS began to falter. It seems they simply forgot about the dragon timer, and thus were unprepared when it spawned. Though the most apparent and foolish mistake was when Syndra moved out of position and wasted her spells, the more important mistake was the overall lack of preparation, which should have started well before the dragon spawned. 

Showing poor prioritization now, Nasus farmed his jungle instead of holding the bot turret, allowing DIG to be in position to pressure bot turret as dragon spawned. With Shen also failing to roam down, TS was in poor position to contest a dragon that they should have easily taken. Though it does not excuse Syndra's mistake, TS should have never been in that type of position to begin with.

After this point, TS played more sloppily, though they still made some great moves, and DIG did well to recognize these mistakes and capitalize off them.

###V. Final Thoughts

Throughout all of their relegation matches, TS displayed a level of play higher than what the majority of NA LCS teams have shown they are capable of. At their best, TS is right there at the top, rivaling the best of the NA teams. However, they are unable to maintain this level of play. Though TS shows higher upside, DIG's superior consistency makes them a much better team, and allowed them to win the relegation series comfortably. Still, TS shows great promise, and with more consistency, could be a major force in the competitive scene.",,False,,t5_2wenn,False,,,True,t3_1ej4na,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1ej4na/indepth_analysis_team_summons_almost_flawless/,

1363896397.0,30,self.summoners,1ar48d,Optimizing Rune Pages for Season 3,37,7,58,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1ar48d/optimizing_rune_pages_for_season_3/,"Inspired by the recent thread on rune efficiencies, I want to make a thread to discuss new rune pages for Season 3. I often still see people recommending the 15 ad or the 21 ap rune pages from season 1 and 2, and I can't help but feel that these pages are outdated. Below, I'm going to outline some of my rune pages, and please share your pages in the comments.


**For ADCs**:

* The standard page that almost everyone recommends: AD quints, AD marks, armor seals, mr or mr/lvl glyphs

This gives you +15 AD, +13 armor, +12 MR. This is very safe. The early boost of AD makes you lasthit easier and trade better pre 6. However, I feel that this is antiquated. In Season 3, ADCs start with doran blade or long sword 2 pots. This item start makes lasthitting easy enough that you don't need the bonus ad. I only recommend the +15 AD page if you plan on being aggressive and trade a lot pre 6.

* Alternative #1: AD quints, armor pen marks, armor seals, mr or mr/lvl glyphs

Flat armor penetration is stronger in season 3 and scales much better into the mid game. I still keep the AD quints because 1. they're very cost effective 2. you can still trade early game.  I find AD quints, and armor pen marks to be the best compromise between early and mid game power.

* Alternative #2: armor pen quints, attack speed marks, armor seals, mr or mr/lvl glyphs

This page is good for ADCs that scale well with attack speed. Certain champions don't need much early game bonus AD, so I'd rather get more autoattacks in. I use this page for Varus, Trist, and Vayne. This page is bad for champions that use AD scaling abilities however.

* Alternative #3: lifesteal quints, ad marks, armor seals, mr or mr/lvl glyphs

This page is for champions that just want to sustain and farm. Kogmaw, I'm looking at you. This page can also be used for duelists because the +6% lifesteal is a substantial amount.


**AP carries**:

* the standard: AP quints, magic pen marks, mana regen seals, ap/lvl glyphs

This page is also antiquated in my opinion. It's made for long range burst mages that have fallen out of flavor. The lack of magic resist makes laning and trading very difficult in the current meta.  Only recommended if you have a super easy lane opponent.

* Alternative #1: AP quints, magic pen marks, mana regen seals, MR glyphs

The page is basically the same as the one above, but with MR glyphs over ap/lvl. The addition of +12 MR is very helpful in the laning phase when you're harassing with spells. This should be the new standard.

* Alternative #2: AP quints, magic pen marks, armor seals, ap/lvl glyphs

Many people are running AD casters mid. You will want to run armor seals vs them. 

* Alternative #3: MS quints, magic pen marks, armor seals, MR glyphs

I use this page for melee mages that are easily harassed by both autos and spells. The +4.5% movespeed helps with roaming as well. This page is also great for aggressive supports.



**Support page**: gp10 quints, AD marks, armor seals, MR glyphs

I use this for pretty much every ranged support. gp10s on supports are great, and the AD marks help with harassing.



**Jungle page #1**: AD quints, attackspeed marks, armor seals, mr/lvl glyphs

This is purely optimized for clear speed for auto attacking junglers. Several junglers have abilities that scale with attackspeed as well.



**Jungle page #2**: lifesteal quints, ad marks, armor seals, mr or mr/lvl glyphs

This is the same lifesteal page from the ADC section. Lifesteal quints make jungling incredibly safe and can easily sustain you to 100% hp with the machete 5 pot start. This page also makes you a bigger threat in a early gank or invade before your first recall.


I hope this write up gives you some ideas for how to optimize your rune pages for Season 3. Again, please share your own setups in the comments.

(Curse opted to not use a ban against Coast in their week 6 match-up, and in Week 8 TSM did not get to use their 3rd ban against CLG)
The most banned position across the league is the mid-lane, followed by top and jungle. Support and ADC roles are the least banned and even if counted as a unit would be the lowest banned at just under 16%.

Cloud 9 has relied on only 27 different champions (lowest in the league) to get to their league leading 21-2 record before superweek. They’ve drawn bans to 16 different champions, most notably 12 against Rumble and 9 each for Zac and Jayce. Proportionally the team has been banned against very much in line with the leagues overall trend based on player roles. 

* (4) Hai - 25.429 - 8 Twisted Fate bans

Vulcun is perhaps the most even team across the board and the bans aggainst them seem to support that claim – they have the smallest difference between the highest and lowest banned players in mancloud at 29,92% and Zuna at 11,59%. Their 38 different champions played is second only to Curse at 40. They’ve had 18 different champions banned in 23 games and it is noteworthy that BloodWater has drawn 11 bans, which is a clear leader among supports.

* (9) mancloud - 20.643 - 9 Twisted Fate bans

CLG has number of standout statistics when it comes to bans against the team. Chauster is the only person in the league who has had 0 bans targeted against him and his 4 different champions played during the season is also league lowest. At the other end of the extreme stand Nientonsoh and Link – Link has commanded 16 bans against his Twisted Fate so far in the season and this is the highest a champion has been banned against a team. Not only is the new toplane convert Nientonsoh leading all toplaners in bans against him, but his 12 different champions played is league highest among all roles.

* (5) Nientonsoh - 25.333 - 8 Jayce bans

* (16) Bigfatlp - 14.5 - 7 Nunu bans
* (27) Doublelift - 6.833 - 6 Tristana bans
* (40) Chauster - 0 - No champions banned against him

Team Dignitas boasts the leagues most banned player in their midlaner Scarra who has been the target of bans a scratch more than 50% of the time – with 9 different champions banned against him he holds the leagues top position in that category alongside CLGs Nientonsoh. While Kiwikid has the 2nd most bans in the team he draws the least bans for a toplaner in the entire league. The team as a whole has played 34 different champions in the 8 weeks and has had 23 different champions banned in that timespan.

* (1) scarra - 34.583 - 9 Zed bans
* (17) KiWiKiD - 13.81 - 3 Kennen bans

* (34) imaqtpie - 4 - 2 Draven bans
* (34) Patoy - 4 - 3 Sona bans

Team Solo Mid has almost a perfect name for their ban situation. Reginald has accounted for exactly 50% of the bans – 15 bans against his Karthus is the 2nd highest single champion ban against a specific player. Dyrus pulls in a respectable amount of bans for a toplaner, but the rest of the 3 combine for just over 20% of total bans, largely due to TheOddOne only being banned against 6 times during the whole season. For comparison that’s at best 50% of what other junglers demand and almost 4 times less than NK Inc.

Curse has so far played on 40 different champions, which is the highest in the league and all their players are close to the very top of different champions played among their positions. They’ve drawn bans to 20 different champions in the 8 weeks and the proportion among different roles is quite close to the league average - slightly more bans towards Voyboy and Edward and slightly less towards Nyjacky. An interesting tidbit is that while Nunu with 10 bans was the highest banned champion against Curse – when it wasn’t banned they never picked it.

* (7) NyJacky - 22.667 - 7 Twisted Fate bans
* (12) Voyboy - 20.533 - 7 Elise bans

Team Coast has had league highest 25 different champions banned against them, they’re also leading the league in number of champions that have been banned against a team without ever seeing playtime – Coast has a total of 9 bans against Rengar, Khazix, Lulu, Trundle and Tryndamere without playing any of them. They’ve also drawn a team high 11 bans against Riven, who nobody else in the league seems to play, but ZionSpartan does and Team Coast are 5-0 in the games that he has been allowed to do so. Their support Daydreamin leads all supports in different champions banned against him with 4, while it may seem a low number, no other support has had more than 2 different champions banned.

Velocity was the only team in the Summer Split to go through roster changes in the North American LCS and as such their current Top and Midlaners are among the lowest for banned against statistics in the league. They had a total of 17 different champions banned against them – two of which (Kayle and Rumble) were exclusive to Vileroze. One thing that separates them from all other teams in the league is that they’re the only team to have most bans against a jungler - NK Inc was target by almost 40% of the bans against the team.

Aatrox is coincidentally the newest champion to be added to the pool, which should help reflect the current design philosophy at Riot

Abilities are from the [wiki page](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Aatrox)

Passive:  Blood Well
Cooldown: 225
&gt;Whenever Aatrox uses an ability that costs health, he stores 100% of the health cost into his Blood Well. The maximum amount of health the Blood Well can store equals 30 + (45 × level). If Aatrox has not dealt or received damage in the last 5 seconds, his Blood Well will deplete at a rate of 2% per second.

&gt;Upon taking fatal damage, Blood Well activates and places Aatrox in stasis for 3 seconds. Over the stasis duration the Blood Well is emptied and Aatrox restores health equal to its contents plus 10.5 + (15.75 × level). Blood Well's activation has a static cooldown and is unaffected by cooldown reduction.

&gt;Also, Aatrox passively increases his attack speed by 1% for every 2% in the Blood Well.

Thoughts:

* Theme: The resurrection aspect of the passive certainly fits with the idea that Aatrox wins fights against the odds even though he dies. This synergizes well with the idea that expending his life force makes him fight harder.

* Flow:  The AS boost combines well with his kit which emphasizes dueling and combines with blood thirst to make him deceptively tanky at low amounts of health.  This also encourages him to build Ad in order to make use of the bonus AS.  The resurrect passive also helps make certain build path more appealing and emphasizes building damage and defensive stats as opposed to health, especially since other abilities cost a percent of health and his healing is a flat amount that scales with AD.

* Balance: The value of the resurrect passive can only be compared to GA.  The GA passive restores 30% of max health which means that at about 3797 hp an equal amount of health is restored assuming a full bar.  Additionally, the cooldown is 75 seconds shorter than GA (only 30 seconds shorter with 2 points in artificer).  This is probably roughly equal to the GA passive [which is worth 1000 gold](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Guardian_Angel) since it is dependent on Aatrox dying with a full bar.  
Additionally his passive grants between 0 and 50% attack speed.  Attack speed is worth between 30 and 33 gold per point and thus, depending on how prolonged the engagement he gains between 0 and 1650 gold worth of stats.  This works out nicely, because this doesn't give him enormous power during the beginning of fights and therefor in team fights which are usually relatively short he gains less of a benefit from it than he does from prolonged chases and smaller prolonged skirmishes.
Summary:  Overall his passive is very strong and provides an enormous amount of value (up to 2650), but it is entirely dependent on Aatrox spending his HP in order to gain this benefit.  This encourages aatrox to avoid constantly healing and helps encourage his intended all in dive playstyle.

Q: Dark Flight Range: 650  Cooldown: 16 / 15 / 14 / 13 / 12  Cost: 10% of current health

* Theme:  Works fine with the super warrior archetype that Aatrox is a part of.  In my opinion, this ability was chosen to round out the kit as opposed to being a core mechanic for the character, which is fine, but leaves it lacking any real reason why Aatrox has this and not some other champ.

* Flow:  This ability is clearly designed to allow Aatrox a hard engage and to prevent him from being constantly kited.  The choice to have it cost 10% current hp although counter-intuitive serves a dual purpose.  When hard engaging with this ability from full health, it costs the most, which actually helps Aatrox get a reasonable amount of AS from his passive to start with and leaves him with at least some hp in his blood well should he die.  Additionally it allows him to use it as an escape with a very small cost.

* Balance:  The obvious comparison to make is with Malphites ultimate, and on release many complained that Aatrox had Malph's ult on a regular ability cooldown, however Aatrox's Q is interruptable, lacks a stun on top of the knockup, and has a much smaller aoe that is knocked up.  The real difference is simply the role that the two play and that malphites ability has much more potential becuase of his kit.

W: Blood Thirst/ Blood Price Cooldown: .5  Cost:N/A

&gt;Toggle off: Aatrox heals himself on every third attack. If Aatrox is below 50% health he will heal for three times as much. 

&gt;Heal: 20 / 25 / 30 / 35 / 40 (+25% bonus AD) 

&gt;Enhanced heal: 60 / 75 / 90 / 105 / 120 (+75% bonus AD)

&gt;Toggle on: Aatrox deals bonus physical damage on every third attack at the cost of health.

&gt;Bonus physical damage: 60 / 95 / 130 / 165 / 200 (+100% bonus AD)

&gt;Health cost on third attack: 15 / 23.75 / 32.5 / 41.25 / 50 (+25% bonus AD)

The core mechanic of Aatrox's kit and arguably the most interesting mechanic, the skill is designed to allow aatrox to do high bonus damage while helping him more speedily reach 50% during fights, at which point the ideal choice is based on the situation, while providing limited and controlled sustain in the lane or the jungle.

Thoughts:
* Theme:  A core mechanic that reflects the central idea of using his own vitality to bolster his attacks until he seems like he is about to be defeated at which point the triple healing kicks in.  A well thought out skill in terms of fitting in with the champ lore

* Flow:  This is the area where this skill shines.  The skill is designed to allow Aatrox to do high bonus damage while helping him more speedily reach 50% during fights, at which point the ideal choice is based on whether Aatrox has the health to clean up with the increased damage or whether he needs to tank the dps of whomever he is diving, while providing limited and controlled sustain in the lane or the jungle.

* Balance:  Balance wise this skill shouldn't ever be a major problem simply because it is very easy to adjust numbers in order to change how much of an impact this skill has.  As far as I know, there are no real balance concerns with this skill at the moment from either Riot or the community.  The heal is a fairly standard heal and the numbers are slightly lower than Xin Zhao's heal most likely because of the triple heal as well as the fact that the heal amount scales with AD as opposed to AP.  The bonus 3rd hit damage is also very high. Since Aatrox effectively gains 33% bonus damage while Blood Price is toggled on, the only percentage based AD boost that is stronger is malphite's brutal strikes which gives an extra 40% (Feel free to correct me if this is wrong).  Additionally, his bons 66 damadge on hit is well above most ad bruisers and only outdone by Taric, Poppy, Yi, Gragas, Mundo, and Alistar.  Some interesting side effects of the self imposed damage is that with 25% lifesteal this ability has no cost against an enemy with no armor and that this ability damages Aatrox more against an enemy with 300 armor or more.

E: Blades of Torment Range: 1000 Cooldown: 12 / 11 / 10 / 9 / 8  Cost: 5% of current health

&gt;ACTIVE: Deals magic damage to enemies in a line and slowing them by 40% for a few seconds.


&gt;MAGIC DAMAGE: 75 / 120 / 165 / 210 / 255 (+ 60% AP) (+ 60% bonus AD)


&gt;SLOW DURATION: 1.75 / 2 / 2.25 / 2.5 / 2.75

Thoughts:

* Theme:  This ability has more or less no correlation with what Aatrox is supposed to be and appears to be an ability that was added to provided needed cc in a new targeting shape.

* Flow: Because the slow length scales as opposed to the slow percentage, this skill allows Aatrox to get the upper hand in trades in lane, and the increased duration once leveled up makes it much more useful for chasing.  The triangle shape and slow projectile speed means that it is much easier to hit on close targets or targets that  are chasing, as opposed to targets that are farther away and running.

* Balance:  This skill also doesn’t seem to have any major balances issues or reasons for special attention when balancing since it is a generic aoe slow with decent AP and AD scaling.  If the skill is found to be too weak or strong, other options to consider are increasing or decreasing the distance between the starting projectiles or to change the projectile speed.

R: Massacre Cooldown: 100 / 85 / 70

&gt;Active: For the next 12 seconds, Aatrox gains bonus attack speed and 175 bonus attack range (325 total range). His attacks are still considered melee. 

&gt;MAGIC DAMAGE: 200 / 300 / 400 (+ 100% AP) ATTACK SPEED: 40 / 50 / 60%
Thoughts:

* Theme:  Although bland, the Nasus/Renekton style of get bigger and do AOE damage does match up with the legendary warrior setup that Aatrox has and the bonus AS that stacks with his passive magnifies this idea of his frenzy becoming greater as he approaches death.

* Flow:  Again this ability flows fairly well, although this is unimpressive since it has very little to it.  During teamfights you essentially want to pop this as soon as you go in with your Q since it lasts long enough that timing is unimportant.  It is as simple as this: Jump in and pop ult for more damage and AS.

* Balance A fairly straightforward ult like this shouldn’t be hard to balance, but it does have some smaller details to finesse and critique.  First of all, adding range is a mechanic that I have mixed feelings about, because it helps temporarily fill in a weakness, but it doesn’t feel nearly as fun as something as powerful should.  Additionally, the 1:1 ap ratio is ridiculous and seems like a newb trap since playing him as Ap is clearly extremely subpar.  I question why Riot chose to add this.  Other than that, magic damage is a good choice since it scales better into late game where armor is more common without getting out of control with armor pen stacking.

Out of characters, but I would love some feedback and discussion about the champ and the format

Original post can be found [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1gvc8c/na_lcs_week_2_unofficial_elo_ratings/), though I think it failed to make it through /new.  I hope this is informative enough for your standards!  
____________________________________

Hello again LoL community, I'm here with another week of ratings, as well as a new feature for this thread.  I also have a request: if anyone knows how (if it's possible) to format multiple line breaks in a row so that I can have things a bit more spaced out in these posts, please let me know.  I hate how compressed everything looks.

Now, onto the new ratings!  


| Rank| Team | Elo Rating | Elo Change| Win-Loss |
|:---:|:-----:|:---------:|:-------------:|:-----:|
|1|C9|1274|-7|6-1|
|2|CLG|1224|+42|4-3|
|3|CST|1216|-5|4-3|
|4|VUL|1213|-1|4-3|
|5|TSM|1212|-4|4-3|
|6|DIG|1182|-2|3-4|
|7|CRS|1158|+7|2-5|
|8|VES|1120|-30|1-6|  

So CLG basically stole everyone else's elo (elo is a zero sum system, add up all the numbers in the fourth column and you should get zero), with wins over C9 and TSM rocketing them up the list.  Are they just raising the hopes of their fans in order to crush them later, or is this a sign of something real?  Only time can tell.  

Note though, how quickly elo can change significantly.  Small elo differences are essentially meaningless when just two games can gain or lose you over 40 points.  The difference between Cloud 9 and Velocity, however, is looking pretty meaningful at this point.

Now for some exciting new content!

My EU counterpart, /u/Forcepath, came up with the idea of providing win probability estimates for the specific matches each week.  Keep an eye out for his post at the end of each week for EU elo ratings!  

**Quick Disclaimer:**  Elo is designed to provide a win probability estimate given the difference in rating between two teams.  These estimates are only accurate once teams are near their ""true elo,"" so take them with a grain of salt after only seven games.  In addition, League is a lot more complicated than can be expressed by a single number like elo.  These estimates are to give you a rough idea of teams' relative strengths.

**Week 3 Match Win Probabilities**

|Blue Team|Est. Win%||Est. Win%|Red Team|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|TSM|**54%**|vs|46%|DIG|
|VES|45%|vs|**55%**|CRS|
|CLG|**52%**|vs|48%|VUL|
|CST|42%|vs|**58%**|C9|
|VUL|**54%**|vs|46%|DIG|
|CLG|43%|vs|**57%**|C9|
|CRS|42%|vs|**58%**|TSM|
|CST|**63%**|vs|37%|VES|
|VUL|41%|vs|**59%**|C9|
|CRS|42%|vs|**58%**|CST|
|CLG|**52%**|vs|48%|TSM|
|DIG|**59%**|vs|41%|VES|

C9 has a tough week ahead of them, facing off against the second, third, and fourth rated teams!  Even so, their much higher elo gives them good chances in each game and a 62% chance of having a winning record for the week (and a ~20% chance of going 3-0).  

I leave the rest of the interpreting up to you!

**Some Quick Math Notes**

* I did indeed start everyone at 1200 elo.
* I am using a k of 36, slightly on the high side, so that ratings have a chance to diverge over the short season.
* I am willing to consider decreasing k mid way through the season once scores have had a chance to settle a bit, but am strongly leaning against doing so at the moment.
* Win probability estimates are calculated using the following formula: 1/(1+10^((rating of B - rating of A)^)/400 )",,False,,t5_2wenn,False,,dignitas,True,t3_1gvein,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1gvein/week_2_na_lcs_unofficial_elo_ratings_xpost_from/,

______________________________________________________________________________________________
**I. Introduction**

Map terrain is a crucial, yet often overlooked, factor in competitive League of Legends today. When teamfighting, a team that takes advantage of the map terrain can erase huge deficits, allowing the underdog team to completely turn the game around. One of the most impactful map terrain elements is the choke point.

Choke points occur at any point in which a relatively straight path narrows suddenly. This narrowing restricts side to side movement as teams move through the choke, forcing teams into generally poor positioning, often determining the result of a teamfight. In game 3 of the NA LCS Spring Playoff Finals between TSM and GGU, there were 3 teamfights which were impacted heavily by choke points. In this analysis, we will examine each of these 3 teamfights, analyzing how the chokes dictated team positioning and led to losses for the team that failed to recognize them.

**Team Comps**

**TSM:** **Renekton** (Dyrus), **Cho'gath** (TheOddOne), **Diana** (Reginald), **Caitlyn** (WildTurtle), **Sona** (Xpecial)

**GGU:** **Rumble** (ZionSpartan), **Nocturne** (NintendudeX), **Orianna** (Jintae), **Twitch** (DontMashMe), **Thresh** (Daydreamin)


______________________________________________________________________________________________
**II. Teamfight 1: [14:16-14:42]**

**[[IMAGES] Teamfight Breakdown](http://imgur.com/a/ganmZ#0)**

**Analysis:**

There were 2 key positional mistakes TSM was forced into because they chose to initiate through the ledge choke. First, with the added zoning of Orianna's slow, the choke forced TSM to group at the edge, allowing Rumble to land an ult hitting all 3 squishies of TSM. This dealt some damage, but more importantly, it forced Sona to split upwards to get out of the ult. 

Second, because Renekton and Cho'gath were lagging behind from finishing the dragon, they would be too late to the fight if they followed with their team; the choke restricts movement to the left, the most convenient retreat path for GGU. Thus, their best move was to run through the river to arrive at the fight as soon as possible and cut off the retreat path. This also allowed them to avoid the choke, but it split them from their squishies. 

Thus, the choke effectively split all of TSM away from Caitlyn, save for Diana. However, she had wasted all her cooldowns on Thresh, so Nocturne was able to ult onto Caitlyn and separate her, which was the biggest determinant of the teamfight.

However, it was not necessarily a bad idea to engage from the choke in this case. For this particular location, the thin wall of the ledge gives a convenient escape from the choke with almost any dash ability, and Diana and Caitlyn had flash and net respectively. What was necessary was for TSM to be cognizant of the choke and be prepared to escape out of it. But clearly, this was not the case; Caitlyn chose to run away from the side of the ledge instead of netting over it, which would be the right course of action if she were not separated in a choke. 

Overall, the teamfight was sloppy by TSM from more than just a choke point perspective. GGU's item builds were not geared toward engaged teamfights at the time, so had Diana not wasted her spells on Thresh or Renekton not focused Rumble, TSM could have still won the fight, even with the loss of Caitlyn. However, the biggest loss in this teamfight was Caitlyn's death, and the next 2 teamfights are almost entirely dictated by the presence of choke points.

**In Brief: Engaging through the choke forced TSM into split positioning, allowing Nocturne to separate Caitlyn and solo her.**
______________________________________________________________________________________________
**III. Teamfight 2: [20:34-20:52]**

**[[IMAGES] Teamfight Breakdown](http://imgur.com/a/ganmZ#10)**

**Analysis:**

This teamfight perfectly demonstrates the primary disadvantage of moving through choke points: the limited lateral movement leaves players susceptible to skillshot and AOE abilities. Thus, when a team engages through a choke, the enemy can usually zone the carries easily, splitting the team and focusing down the initiator freely. This exact scenario happened twice in this teamfight, with each team foolishly engaging through a choke, and dying as a result.

As Thresh first engaged, Cho'gath zoned the GGU squishies with the threat created by his AOE, allowing TSM to freely focus Thresh, bursting him and forcing his flash. As Nocturne ulted, GGU was no longer completely zoned since TSM had used some abilities, but they could still only safely focus Cho'gath from a distance. Thus, when Cho'gath was low, he was able to easily flash out of range. Meanwhile, the GGU carries could not follow up with Nocturne, so TSM could freely position themselves in the spacious river area and fully focus Nocturne, leaving him with no escape even if he flashed. 

As the GGU carries moved forward in the choke, the restricted movement allowed Sona to easily ult both GGU solos and allowed Cho'gath to predict Rumble's forward movement and land a stun, stopping any GGU follow up as Nocturne tried to run back. Cho'gath's stun caught Rumble out of position as TSM finished off Nocturne, and he was forced to burn his flash before TSM could turn. In contrast, Orianna's ult was easily avoided by most of TSM, hitting only Cho'gath; the zoning limited her ball placement and made it more predictable, and TSM had multple directions to spread out to. 

However, TSM then tried to engage into the choke themselves, forgetting that many of their skills have been used and they are low. The threat of AOE and CC zoned 3 members of TSM, so the initiators, Diana and Sona, were easily focused down within the choke, ending the fight at 2-1 for GGU. All the deaths were a result of the positional disadvantage created by engaging through the choke point.

**In Brief: Poor engages into the choke by both teams allowed the enemy to zone, splitting the initiators from the rest of the team, and focusing them down easily.**
______________________________________________________________________________________________
**IV. Teamfight 3: [24:53-25:40]**

**[[IMAGES] Teamfight Breakdown](http://imgur.com/a/ganmZ#20)**

**Analysis:**

The area between the wraith brush and lane entrance chokes is an especially hazardous area, forcing a team to not only initiate through a choke for a teamfight, but also to retreat through one if they are caught. Thus, when GGU was forced behind the wraith brush, TSM should have had an easy tower, and GGU should have been forced to run all the way around the wall to get to mid lane.

However, Cho'gath wasted both his AOE skills, which allowed GGU move forward safely to the tower, as the rest of TSM's AOE threat was not in position. It did not give GGU an opening to initiate, however, since GGU was still grouped up from moving through the choke point. They needed to reposition first, but Nocturne initiated anyway, allowing Renekton and Diana to burst the clumped GGU carries. Meanwhile, with ample room to run, Caitlyn was able to kite Nocturne and maneuver around the Rumble ult while the rest of TSM peeled, allowing TSM to eventually clean up for an ace.

Once again, both teams fail to account for the choke points. Had Cho'gath saved his AOE threat, TSM would have gotten the inner turret simply off the push. Instead, GGU got an opening to defend the turret. However, GGU's poor initiation nullified the mistake and created an even better outcome for TSM.

**In Brief: TSM failed to zone GGU at the choke point, but GGU initiated before repositioning, causing their carries to remain clumped and allowing TSM to kill them quickly.**
______________________________________________________________________________________________
**V. Key Points**

In summary, these are the effects choke points had on these 3 fights:

* **Susceptibility to AOE and Skillshots** - The restricted movement caused teams to clump and move more predictably, allowing Rumble ults, Sona ults, Cho'gath stuns and many other abilities to land on multiple important targets. 

* **Zoning** - In teamfight 2, multiple heroes were zoned just by the threat of AOE and skillshots. Thus, as each teams' initiator engaged, the rest of the team could not follow up properly. 

* **Split Positioning** - Even without zoning by the enemy team, choke points still caused split positioning. In teamfight 1, Cho'gath and Rumble had to split from the rest of TSM because they were lagging behind. The limited lateral movement meant that if they ran through the choke and GGU ran up the mid lane, it would take too long to follow up. Thus, they split from the team to cut off the mid lane retreat, but left Caitlyn defenseless in the process.

______________________________________________________________________________________________
**VI. Final Thoughts**

Failing to account for choke points is one of the most common teamfighting mistakes in competitive League of Legends. Most teams seem to have some innate understanding of the effects of map terrain, but do not seem to have directly addressed them. As a result, teams play with a subconscious feel for map terrain, but are not always actively thinking about it, so huge choke point disadvantages are often overlooked for trivial reasons.

This is one of the biggest areas of improvement for any team. Those that work to be consistently and actively aware of choke points and other map terrain features will improve their teamfighting and overall play greatly.",,False,,t5_2wenn,False,,,True,t3_1dniao,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1dniao/indepth_analysis_choke_point_play_analyzing_the/,
1367603229.0,27,self.summoners,1dmq90,"Delving into the versatility, niches, and potential of Tryndamere. (Also, the State of Melee ADC's)",32,5,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1dmq90/delving_into_the_versatility_niches_and_potential/,"**Introduction:**


Hey guys, I'm iPandaN! I post on this subreddit occasionally with theorycrafts, but today I wanted to talk about what I have learned from my experience in the last few days. I accquired a drastically different perception of Tryndamere after spamming jungle tryndamere for about a week.

_________________________________________________


**The State of Melee ADC's:**


This is a discussion we've all had or read so many times, but look at the different ""melee-ADC's"". None of them are solely melee ADC's, except for Tryndamere. I'm not referring to AP builds. For example, Yi is a Melee ADC/Resetting Assassin hybrid, an Fiora is a AD Caster that transitions into an ADC/AD Caster hybrid late game.


The classic statements are that Melee ADC's are susceptible to CC and Kiting, and that they cannot ""erase"" high priority targets from teamfights, because they will just get CC'd and/or kited. I have learned that the common perception of what role a Melee-ADC should fill is very narrow, and doesn't really have any basis (Because all of the Melee ADC's function very differently.)

_________________________________________________


**Tryndamere's different niches:**


The first niche is the one aforementioned, where Tryndamere will be diving high priority targets. He fulfills this role so well when there is not any CC to shut you down, and their high priority targets are often being CC'd in teamfights. While it is true that Tryndamere cannot fulfill this niche when they pick an obscene amount of CC, it is not true that picking an obscene amount of CC will counter a Tryndamere pick. It just counters this one niche, and not Tryndamere.

Tryndamere's second niche, and the next familiar, is his splitpush and backdoor potential. Yes this is always there with tryndamere, and he's phenomenal at it. I can't tell you how many games I've won where applying pressure as Tryndamere via splitpushing was a major contribution to the win. This is an optional niche you can fill if they pick champs with large amounts of CC.

The third niche Tryndamere can fill is still a melee ADC role, but instead of the ""diving squishies"" paradigm, we'll be beating down the front-line. This means you focus whoever the ADC is auto attacking (9 times out of 10 is a front line champion). **Possible Scenarios:**


-**If you get focused**, you're at most being focused by 3 people (Enemy jungler, mid, and top), as you're not within range of their support and you're not diving the enemy ADC (who doesn't prioritize focus to start with). Any enemy AP that is going to dive your backline, will be a burst champion, and not a DPS champion, because the only AP DPS champion (Karthus, Ziggs, Ryze, Cassiopeia) do not dive the backline (Well maybe suicide Karthus). Any DPS champion diving your backline will be AD, and their DPS will be reduced greatly by your W. Burst champions will blow their combos, rendering them unable to do anything until their abilities come off cooldown. This means if they commit all AD DPS to focus you, pop W and fight tanking with lifesteal for as long as you can until you have to pop your R. Once you pop your R, keep fighting as if they keep focusing you to keep you at 1 hp, they're wasting their time (similar to wasting time attacking some1 who has been ulti'd by kayle), and if they focus other people after you pop ulti, then you lifesteal up and pop Q and BoRK active (which has great synergy with trynd ultimate) to have decent health when your ulti wears off. If they commit all burst champions, then just ult when they burst you and they will have no cooldowns. Lifesteal back up and stay because they have no DPS to keep you from heal tanking. If they commit some combination of DPS/Burst then it still greatly benefits your team to have 1-2 of their burst champions' abilities on cooldown. 


**Short Version:** Whoever is diving you in the backline is going to die to the damage from your Ranged ADC and Yourself. GOOD scenario.


-**If they understand that focusing Tryndamere is like focusing Karthus, and focus your Ranged ADC:** Just focus whoever your ranged ADC is focusing (Unless there is an assassin such as Zed trying to get to your ADC. In this scenario focus them and they won't be able to do anything to peel you, and if they try to burst you, they just blew all their cooldowns.) and slow them with your W once they run past you to get to your ranged ADC, and BoRK active whichever champion it will peel the most (Not really peel the most per se, but use the BoRK active on whichever champion that using it reduces the most damage your ranged ADC would take  otherwise). If they only commit 1-2 champions to diving, you should be able to burn through their HP bars insanely fast especially if they are off-tanks. If they commit 3, well then their support and ADC will get killed or zoned out of the fight by your mid and top,  who then will return to ruin the 3 divers' day by forcing a localized 5v3 (Or a 5v2 if everything's gone well and you've already killed one of the divers).


**Short Version:** It can go either way, but if they don't have the CC to disable you and your ranged ADC, and the damage to quickly take down your ADC (You can't have tons of CC and tons of damage, but it could happen with a right mixture of champions), then your combined DPS will win out very quickly. Usually a GOOD scenario.


-**If They are running a Protect the ""X"" strat and not diving, but attempting to counter-initiate and peel so their Carry can DPS your team down:** Your ranged ADC's DPS should be comparable to theirs, but since you have 2 ADC's (Tryndamere and your Ranged ADC), you will be able to eat through their teams HP faster than their carry will eat through yours. It's really situational here, but either focus whoever your ADC is focusing, focus their ADC (Forcing their team to blow CC on you), or focus whoever has the Aegis/FH/etc on their team. I'll admit I haven't dealt with this scenario as it's not very popular in S3, and even more rare in soloq.


**Bad Scenarios/Complications:** 

-Fed Poppy.
-Teams with multiple Attack speed debuffs (I.e. Nasus, Anivia, Malphite, etc.)
-Teams with strong single target suppress (I.e. A malzahar that can ulti you right before your ulti wears off etc.)

**Conclusion:** I'd really like to hear what you guys think about some of the things I've pointed out. I didn't have very long to post this but I love replies, and answering questions/comments. I'd really like to hear a challenger's opinion on tryndamere, and why he wasn't picked as jungle/top when teams were running all AD team comps for a few weeks. It seems that removing 400 AD from an all AD team would really impact their damage. 400 AD is a lot of gold worth of stats you're removing.

Hey for folks that aren't aware, IPL is currently running a live tournament at SXSW where they flew out 10 people:

* Vman

* Hafu

* Takashi

* Pobelter

* Westrice

* IWDominate

* Spellsy

* Wingsofdeath

* Hai

* Phantomlord

Then Hatperson and Baron picked (dodgeball style) one player for each team. Also, once a champion is banned/picked it's banned from the rest of the day, three games each and different teams picked for each day (Sat/Sun). 

For those asking, I'm guessing it was a lot easier to do a smaller tournament at SXSW and harder to cancel it than it was to put IPL on in Vegas.

Either way this should be pretty entertaining since people are playing outside of roll and stuff.

Xypherous has also talked about a shift towards selfish itemization over selfless itemization, specifically in the MR department - coming next patch. Will this flow through to the S4 changes?

Xypherous also mentioned that he wanted to test items that fulfilled a specific niche, so that items became more situational rather than cure-all. The post was found in the forums complaining about balance between Cutlass vs. Phage.

Another thing that was mentioned was a potential global nerf on all ranged champions' base AD to prevent them from being as dominant in places like top lane.

I'm pleased to announce that starting from next week, you can find my previews at Team Liquid as well - shoutout to NeoIllusions for setting me up with this awesome opportunity. I've taken your praise and criticism on board, and hopefully I'll be able to deliver more quality write-ups from now on. Apologies for the lateness, I wasn't going to write this but I decided to at the last minute since there was some stuff about Frost I wanted to write about and couldn't find any other outlet for.

**CJ Entus Blaze vs CJ Entus Frost**

*Overview*

It just wouldn't be a Champions playoffs without Blaze and Frost clashing in a best of 5. MiG Blaze humiliated MiG Frost in a shutout in the first iteration of Champions (coincidentally, also a Spring season). Azubu Frost beat out Azubu Blaze in five nail-biting games in Champions Summer, and again in ten games in Champions Winter. The two teams live and breathe League of Legends under the same roof. It is often said that Blaze has the best chance of beating Frost, and that Frost has the best chance of beating Blaze. In some aspects, this is true - each team knows the playstyle of the other like their own. Hours upon hours of practice, each team bouncing strategies and compositions off each other culminate in some of the best games of League of Legends ever witnessed when Blaze and Frost collide.

The two teams have performed extraordinarily well in Champions Spring so far. Blaze came into the tournament with a lot of skepticism surrounding them, with the recent weak play of bot lane Captain Jack and Lustboy raising questions as to whether they could make it to the round of 4 three seasons in a row. Top laner Flame had something to say about that, however, as his rapid improvement led many to consider him the best top laner in Korea, if not the world. Off the back of Flame and Blaze's other solo laner Ambition, the CJ Entus side has wowed fans and dispelled all doubts existing in the minds of critics. Blaze destroyed Reapered's SK Telecom T1 #1 in three games in the quarterfinal, and are coming into this game with an air of confidence.

Frost are no strangers to finals pressure. True to form, they have performed consistently well this season, with a current record of 11-4 and having not lost a single set. Should they fall to their sister team tonight, Frost will have received their worst Champions result in history, as they have made it to the grand final of every tournament thus far. The consistency of solo laners Shy and RapidStar has taken them to the round of 4, dispatching of last season's winners Najin Sword in the quarterfinal - the very team that took three games in a row against them in the grand final.

*Flame On - Top Lane*

In my previous article, I described the showdown between Faker and dade as the second-most anticipated match-up of the semifinals. It is extraordinarily difficult to not view the battle between Blaze's top laner **Flame** and his Frost counterpart **Shy** as the most exciting match-up to date in Champions, and possibly the most exciting match-up in recent League of Legends history. The core players of their respective teams, Flame and Shy are in top form, made especially significant as Shy was the one who taught Flame the ins and outs of playing top lane in the Korean competitive scene. Student challenges master as the two top laner juggernauts come head-to-head tonight.

Flame, once dismissed as a struggling top laner on a struggling team, has completely turned his play around to become Korea's most feared top laner. Currently, the Blaze top laner is currently leading the Sonokong MVP rankings, with 700 points, 50 points ahead of the now eliminated Faker, and MVP Ozone's support Mata who Flame will face if Blaze wins this semifinal. Flame is the core player of Blaze's split-pushing strategy, employing a unique style without the use of champions with teleports such as Shen or even champions with strong escapes like Nidalee. Rather, he favours champions such as Kennen, Jayce, Kha'zix and even a new concoction in Ryze. All of these champions are able to dominate in one-on-one duels, and present a serious pushing threat. It is not unusual to see Flame pull two or three defenders at a time, allowing his team to pressure objectives on the other side of the map. Shy has stated that Flame is his favourite player to lane against, though whether or not we will actually see a 1v1 lane between the two tonight remains to be seen, due to Blaze's frequent employment of lane swaps.

Shy returns from Shanghai as a Korean hero, gaining valuable experience playing against international powerhouses Dyrus, soaZ and Pdd. The victorious All-Star wields a skillset and champion pool rivaling his opponent Flame's, also being the core player of Frost's strategy. Despite their similarities, Shy's role in Frost's broader game plan is much different. His Jayce is a core component of Frost's poke compositions, while his Kennen and Rumble are central to their AOE compositions. Like Flame, his Ryze is also deadly, though he prefers to run the mage in the middle lane while RapidStar takes a side lane. Ultimately, a head-to-head between Shy and Flame will come down to the champions which they pick. Currently, the Korean metagame is very solo lane-centred, with Kha'zix, Diana, Jayce and Rumble being common bans. It would be foolish to believe that Shy does not have a new champion prepared for this semifinal. His rapid adaptation to new champions has been a beauty to witness, as Jayce is now a perma-ban against him after only a few weeks of play.

Both Flame and Shy are extraordinary players, which has led their teams to construct strategies centred around their top laners. The players will have a lot of attention on them in the upcoming games, in an attempt to shut them (and by extension, their teams) down. With this in mind, the outcome of their match-up will be decided by who can overcome resistance the best and perform their role.

*On Cloud Nine - Jungle*

Once upon a time, Blaze's **Helios** and Frost's **CloudTemplar** were worlds apart in their playstyle. In previous days, Helios' 'carnivore' tendencies would allow Blaze to aggressively shut out games with repeated ganks coordinated with Ambition. CloudTemplar, the exemplar 'herbivore' jungler, defaulted to a support role, initiating fights and protecting his carries. With the season 3 jungle, however, both players have gravitated towards a more holistic jungle style, focusing on taking early objectives rather than favouring ganks or farm. 

Helios has had to deal with mounds of criticism, as many feel his jungling has not been up to the Korean standard. His disappointing play on Jarvan IV against Judgement Day in the group stage led many to call for a replacement, and many more to question Blaze's chances in Champions Spring. Since then, Helios has picked up an old favourite of his, Lee Sin, occasionally looking to Nasus as an option. His versatile, bruiser-oriented playstyle has been a factor in Blaze's recent success, where he has functioned as an 'enabler' for Blaze's superstar solo lanes. Slightly more aggressive than his Frost counterpart, Helios will continue to select more aggressive, gank-heavy champions like Lee Sin, or possibly his old flame (pun definitely intended) Nocturne. 

CloudTemplar has surprised many this season with his move towards a more aggressive playstyle. The herbivore jungler is often seen with Hermes and MadLife, employing an almost tri-lane strategy to push early towers, in which he camps bottom lane or helps Hermes push it in. His champion pool has diversified to a certain extent since Champions Spring begun, picking up Elise and Rammus as more aggressive ganking junglers alongside the old herbivore standards Nasus and Shen. However, if he does not pick a ganking jungler, CloudTemplar cannot be expected to have too much of an impact on the game early. 

The match-up between the two CJ Entus junglers is the opposite of the match-up between bengi and DanDy that we witnessed on Wednesday. Both players do not want too much trouble from the other, and should focus more on executing their team's strategy rather than shutting each ot her down. Both Blaze and Frost know that their junglers are not the strongest, and we can expect the early game to be fairly stagnant. 

*Grand Final Ambitions - Mid Lane* 

Blaze's All-Star **Ambition** and Frost veteran **RapidStar** present an equally weighted match-up, much like their top lane counterparts. Although consistent players who typically take a backseat to their top laners, Ambition and RapidStar play a greater role when Blaze and Frost go head-to-head, due to both players being fairly passive mid laners, opting to farm and help their teams with objectives rather than try for kills. As such, both Ambition and RapidStar should enjoy a greater degree of freedom and influence on the game as they come up against a similarly passive opponent.

While Frost's Shy went to Shanghai to take home a Korean victory, it was Blaze's Ambition that was chosen by the Korean community. Regarded the strongest mid laner in Korea (stronger than Judgment Day's Faker), Ambition's ability to farm no matter how much pressure he is faced with has allowed him to function as an auxiliary damage threat. During Shanghai All-Stars, he selected Kennen as a surprise pick, as well as one of his favourite champions Kha'zix. Unfortunately for Blaze fans, Ambition will not be allowed to pick Twisted Fate, as Frost will not want to give away free games. The likelihood of another surprise pick coming out of Ambition is quite low, but the possiblility should not be discounted.

RapidStar has lived in Ambition's shadow in recent days, with his play not being quite up to scratch. However, years of experience coupled with impressive mechanical ability mean that the Frost mid laner will still pose a threat to Blaze. Whether RapidStar will pick his favourite champion Lux in Frost's poke compositions remains to be seen, but Blaze must be more frightened of his breathtaking Diana, showcased in his destruction of Najin Sword's SSONG in the quarterfinal. Kha'zix, Jayce and Ryze remain favourite picks for RapidStar, and the possibility of the mid Nocturne which he enjoys cannot be discounted, either. Expect RapidStar to pick for Frost's composition, rather than to beat Ambition out.

There is a lot of subtext beneath this otherwise standard mid lane match-up. Ambition is seeking to utilise his All-Star experience and to remind Korea why they deemed him the mid laner of choice. RapidStar does not want to be considered beneath Ambition in terms of skill, and it should reflect tonight in his play. Nevertheless, both mid laners are exceptionally skilled and spectators will have a lot to look forward to. 

*God on His Throne - Bot Lane*

Perhaps the most lopsided comparison that could be made between Blaze and Frost is that of their respective bot lanes **Captain Jack** and **Lustboy** against **Hermes** and **MadLife**. The Blaze bottom lane has fell from grace, from being considered one of the best bottom lanes in Korea to being considered one of the worst, and an obstacle to Blaze's success. Meanwhile, Hermes and MadLife are considered one of the best, mostly due to the influence of All-Star MadLife, who has proven himself the world's greatest support, if not the world's greatest player. 

Captain Jack and Lustboy have a lot to prove in this match. It is likely that Blaze will elect to send them against Shy, as there is not a great degree of confidence in their abilities in a 2v2 lane. Captain Jack's mechanical prowess is not to be underestimated, however, as his abilities on hypercarries Kog'Maw and Tristana should shine as he comes up against a team that seeks to engage in teamfights rather than split push. Lustboy's synergy with Captain Jack is impressive in teamfights and skirmishes, though his questionable laning decisions lead the Blaze bot lane to give up deaths early. His favourite support Lulu should make an appearance, though his Sona is not out of the question either.

Hermes makes his first semifinal appearance on the side of Frost, fortunately on the side of God-incarnate, MadLife. Hermes has admirably fit the hole that Woong created when he departed the team, opting for teamfight-oriented carries like Miss Fortune and Varus. The attention is certainly not on Hermes when Frost plays, as he is expected to put out damage to allow Shy and RapidStar to clean up. MadLife is the factor that ties Frost together, with near-impossible plays on Thresh and Blitzcrank creating opportunities for his team to push advantages. Certainly, the performance of MadLife will be a huge factor in Frost's ability to pull out a win against Blaze.

It is extremely unlikely that Blaze will send their bottom lane against Frost's, due to the gap in skill. We can expect lane swaps from Blaze in this case, possibly even on blue side. The natural advantage for Frost should prove one of the biggest factors should they claim victory in this semifinal.

*CJ Entus Blaze must*:

* **Allow Flame to carry**. Due to the disparity between  their bottom lane and Frost's, Blaze must rely on Flame's incredible top lane play to create a gold lead and close out games.
* **Play a fast-paced game**. Laning aggression and early objectives have been the key factors in their ten-game winning streak, whereby Helios gives Flame and Ambition the edge over their opponents to win engagements.
* **Prey on Frost's predictability**. The reason Frost have always made the grand final isn't innovation, but consistency. Blaze have a good idea of what Frost will do, and must construct strategies to counter it.

*CJ Entus Frost must:*

* **Limit Flame's opportunities**. Though Flame deserves his reputation as Korea's scariest top laner, if Frost play in a way that his split pushing and dueling prowess cannot come into fruition, they will win.
* **Stress their teamfight dominance**. Frost look to be near-unbeatable when playing in their comfort zone, and must continue to do so against Blaze. Playing an alternative game could lead to Frost's loss.
* **Take early games**. If Frost can come out of the gates with a surprise, the rest of the match will be easier. Should the match come down to blind pick, Frost's history of blind pick dominance will lead to their victory.

*Predictions*

I see two alternative outcomes for this match, which come down to how the early games will play out. If Blaze claims early victory, I do not see them losing. However, if Frost claim early games, they are at liberty to drop games and extract information about Blaze's game plan to claim a blind pick victory.

1362475095.0,22,self.summoners,19p65r,With the current popularity of BotRK...,33,11,49,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/19p65r/with_the_current_popularity_of_botrk/,"...will we see the return of support Nunu?  

Support Nunu  hasn't seen much play, both in competitive and solo-queue, since the nerf to his Blood Boil. I've always loved support Nunu, and I think that with the current popularity of Blade of the Ruined King, support Nunu might be able to make a comeback.  

**Why?**  
Because support Nunu still gives a massive amount (45% with maxed Blood Boil) of attack speed, and BotRK heavily favours attackspeed-based champions. Also, Nunu has a counter to enemies with a BotRK: a 25% attackspeed slow that lasts for 3 seconds on both his E (Ice Blast) and his ultimate, Absolute Zero. I don't think Nunu will be able to reach his former dominance again, for reasons stated below, but I think that, especially when paired to either a late game hypercarry (Tristana, Kog'Maw, Vayne) or an early game attackspeed-based carry such as Caitlyn or Varus, Nunu support will at least become viable again.  

**Why not?**  
Because support Nunu will still be not as good in some areas as a lot of other supports. Compared to Taric and Sona, two of the most popular supports at the moment, Nunu lacks a heal, hard CC and significant defensive steroids (no aura's like Taric's Shatter or Sona's Aria of Perseverance). Nunu has obviously been nerfed, and that took away some of the dominance he could show in the past, but I think he is still very strong. The main reason he might not become popular again, is because other supports (Taric and Thresh, I'm looking at you...) are simply too strong right now.  

**TL;DR:** With the new BotRK, attackspeed-based carries have become very strong. This might make support Nunu popular again, due to the still huge attackspeed bonus on Blood Boil and the attackspeed slow on his E and ultimate. However, Nunu might not become a good pick because supports such as Taric are simply too strong.

1374924685.0,24,self.summoners,1j5mkf,What does the lack of international tournaments in Season 3 mean for the competitive scene?,25,1,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1j5mkf/what_does_the_lack_of_international_tournaments/,"Seasons 1 and 2 (predominantly 2) were played through a series of international tournaments every one or two months - IPLs, MLGs, and so on. As much as I love the LCS format, it's regularity and consistency, it has pushed out any room for international tournaments. With the teams having to practice for meaningful games every week and travelling to the venue and back, there is simply no time for the IPLs of Season 2. 

What this means for the competitive scene is that there is *one* big international tournament per year. World Finals. That's personally what I've missed most about the previous seasons. It's frustrating having absolutely no way to compare the different regions until Worlds, and never being able to rematch epic games from the past like CLG.eu vs TSM, CLG.eu vs Frost, WE vs CLG, M5 vs TPA, etc.

I think it would be great to see these big, best of three/five knock-out tournaments reintroduced. They play very differently to the LCS best of one games, and would be a very welcome change of pace to break up the season.

How I think it would work best is taking a mid-season LCS week and replacing it with one of these tournaments. The problems with this though would be organizing it alongside LPL and OGN and also the fact that it would make the split a week longer.

But my main question is what do you think this lack of international competition means for competitive League? Does it stifle progress? Does it make Worlds a better, more explosive tournament? Is it even feasible, or is it too difficult to organize with travel, etc.? Will teams take them seriously?",,False,,t5_2wenn,False,,eg,True,t3_1j5mkf,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1j5mkf/what_does_the_lack_of_international_tournaments/,

I am Acapella, a staff member of eFlux Gaming and I'd like to inform you all about our upcoming season of our LoL Arena.

**LoL Arena is a league-based tournament that gives you a month to get used to the players on your team and compete against others. You register as a player and enter the pool of draftable players. Your performance in Scouting Lobbies will greatly impact your draft stock. After the draft, you will be informed of your being drafted and you will then be responsible for keeping in contact with your owner about practices. Games will be on Mondays, Wednesdays and Thursdays at 10 PM EST.**

We are fielding 12 teams and are looking for two more owners. Each team will draft 6-7 players(TBD based on number of sign ups) so only roughly 84-96 will be drafted. The rest have the option of entering free agency. Not being drafted is not the end of the world because eFlux is a great community. We usually run community games on a daily basis and allow for other opportunities for competition within the community. Our website is brand new and we are not yet utilizing the new forums. They will be for only social purposes within the community, all formal posts will be made on the main website.

Anyway, without further a-do here is the bare bones version of how you get started with eFlux.

**Step 1: Fill out the sign up sheet on the home page.**

**Step 2: Check the calendar for Scouting Lobbies. You must play in at least one.**

**Step 3: The draft will occur and you will be informed if you are drafted.**

**Step 4: Practice and play with your team and fight for the gold!**

*You can read more in-depth about eFlux Gaming's LoL Arena and sign up here at our main website:* http://efluxgaming.com/

She definitely seems a little stronger but I don't know if she's on-par with other champions similar to her.

What do you guys think of Quinn? Builds? Strategies?
I've played 4 or 5 games as an ADC and I just can't play her well as a normal ADC. Even if she picks up a few kills early on I feel like she can't carry as hard as most of the other ADCs because of her kit.

However building her like a tanky-DPS top laner has seemed to work a little better.

I've been starting Doran's Blade, which I feel like really helps Quinn early on, and I've been building straight in to a Phage and a Zeal depending on how well I'm doing. Then I'll usually turn Phage in to a Mallet and Zeal in to a shiv or PD, then going for a BT. I've yet to try BotRK, but it seems like it could be a good item for her.

I feel like she has a lot of potential but I still can't really figure her out. Her ult seems like it should be used as a chasing/movement tool instead of some kind of team fight execution move. Her W seems really useful. Her Q is really good but her E is kind of strange and I can't really seem to figure out when it's a good time to use it. I usually end up maxing Q first but I don't know if her W or E is better to start maxing next: the E's increased damage seems helpful in top lane trades while the W passive seems really good too.

I apologize if this post isn't quite at the standard of most of the posts on this subreddit, I've been lurking for a few days coming from /r/leagueoflegends",,False,,t5_2wenn,False,,,True,t3_1dj0of,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1dj0of/quinn_and_valor_demacias_wings_post_buff_opinions/,

1362101547.0,21,self.summoners,19fndl,Lane Swaps and Map Pressure have become the focus of the game,32,11,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/19fndl/lane_swaps_and_map_pressure_have_become_the_focus/,"On the professional scene it seems like the team that the team that lane swaps better just has huge mastery over the game. 

It's becoming almost expected that purple side will initiate a lane swap, have their adc/support take golems and start shoving the lane, and once the jungler clears the jungle they go top and take the tower. 

And anyone who saw the Dignitas vs Complexity game today, or the Curse vs CLG game can plainly see that the teams that react and apply map pressure the best just absolutely take command of the games. 

I think the teams that emerge on top will be the ones who are roaming the map, taking objectives, and just exerting pressure. Laning phase is practically obsolete in these games. 

What do you guys think? And if you're looking for a intro on a 2v1 lane swap and the basics on it, feel free to check out my [article on team-dignitas.net](http://www.team-dignitas.net/articles/blogs/League-of-Legends/2947/Breakdown-on-2v1-Lanes/).",,False,,t5_2wenn,False,,,True,t3_19fndl,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/19fndl/lane_swaps_and_map_pressure_have_become_the_focus/,
1361988902.0,22,self.summoners,19c90a,Just in time for Super Week! NA LCS Player Statistics,27,5,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/19c90a/just_in_time_for_super_week_na_lcs_player/,"Hey, its RRCount Moriarty again bringing some more numbers.  This is a brief summary of some interesting NA LCS *Player* Statistics.  The current spreadsheet is [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0ArSHC5_zvDWWdHFwaDU4ejh0b2haeUJrQk5QcTctMlE&amp;output=html) .  This spreadsheet was also the source of data for the [EU LCS Player](http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/199o14/player_statistics_going_into_super_week_at_the_eu/) and [Champion](http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/198my2/eu_lcs_champion_stats_going_into_super_week/) write ups.  Feel free to use the data! 

**Gold/Min**

I'm interested in knowing what you think the best statistical gauge of individual player skill is be it KDA, Gold/Min, Deaths/Min or some other stat you'd like to see calculated. Instead of KDA this time I decided to use Gold/Min to rank the top player in each position just to see what happens.  

* Top Lane: Voyboy, Curse 366
* Jungler: SaintVicious, Curse 307
* Mid Lane: Reginald, TSM 366
* ADC: Imaqtpie, Dignitas 388
* Support: Elementz, Curse 266

Unsurprisingly the undefeated Curse is on top of a majority of the positions.  Somewhat humorously, if ranked by the KDA given on Lolesports the teams would maintain the number of top positions they currently have, but Voyboy would be replaced by Dyrus and Reginald would be replaced by Nyjacky. Teams total Gold/Min is a decent indicator of team success.  If ranked by total Gold/Min the only change in the current standings is that MRN and coL would swap positions.  

**Champion Pool**

Just as in the EU, to measure champion pool first I looked at the number of champions a player had played divided by number of games they've played. This is what I've termed the variety coefficient, the closer it is to 1 the more variety a player has made in their picks.  Unfortunately not all players have played the same number of games, so players who've played more should be given some extra consideration.  Win/Losses should be considered last as a loss might indicate a given champion is not really in a player's pool, or but there are many other factors in a loss.   

**Wide Champion Pools**

* In a completely opposite trend from the EU LCS the ADCs in NA have shown a wider champion pool than other positions.  MRN's Heartbeat has played 4 champions across 4 games. The formidable ADCs Doublelift and Cop have both played 5 different carries in 6 games
* In a statistic that will probably shock just about nobody, there is a good argument for claiming Voyboy has one of the best champion pools in North America.  He (like Cop) has played 5 different champions across 6 games, and won everyone of them.  

* GGU has a couple of members topping the variety poll.  Fat has never played the same champion twice across 5 games.  Nintendude has played 6 different junglers in 7 games and Zionspartan has played 6 champions in his 7 games across two roles.  GGU has certainly show a willingness to try many champions, but have yet to turn that into results.

**Small Champion Pools**

* Dignitas' Patoy has the smallest champion pool.  However, if it isn't broke don't fix it! Patoy is 4-1 on Alistar and Zyra and boast the highest KDA in the NA LCS. 
* 10 Summoners are just about tied for the next smallest Champion Pool. Most of them are Junglers (4) and Supports (3), but interestingly 4 of the players in next 10 are on TSM.  TSM has shown the lowest champion variety of any team, but with a record of 4-2 it seems that not too many teams have figured them out yet.

**NA Player Awards**

* Serial Killer (Highest kills in a single game) Doublelift's Ezreal 12
* Undying (most zero death games) Cop, Dyrus, Xpecial, Zuna 3
* Best Friend (most assist in a single game) M eye A's Taric 21
* Skumbag Award (most kills in a single game by a support player) Bloodwater's Leona 3

I would love to get more ideas for these player awards so let me know if you come up with a good one.  Keep in mind I'm trying to save awards that call for totals (such as Highest Total Kills) until the season ends. 

**Other Stuff**

* Dignitas has the 2 fastest wins in NA.  25:17 against TSM and 25:32 against MRN
* TSM's win over Dignitas was the 4 fastest win in the NA LCS
* Slowest win came from Curse 48:31 over GGU
* Average game length is 35:55
* NA has fewer strats for red side than EU. The current record is Blue 16 Red 8. (EU splits 13-11)
* The most obvious “victims” of repeated target banning are Scara and Reginald. Their Gragas and Leblanc get banned frequently against them, and these champions have never been banned  against another team.

Part 2 examines the second game of the series. Read [Part 1 here](http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1e467n/dignitas_teamfighting_analysis_part_1/).

###I. Teamfight 4 [7:23-7:53]

**Analysis:**

**Key Factors:**

* **DIG properly focused down Ryze, who zoned in too hard on Nasus.**

###II. Teamfight 5 [16:44-17:10]

**Analysis:**

###[[Images]Teamfight Breakdown &amp; Analysis](http://imgur.com/a/Luc4v#0)

This teamfight was decided by the team comps rather than any big mistakes. It ended with no deaths, which is often how fights should end when both teams play well.

**Key Factors:**

* **DIG used their team comp advantage well.** With low range and AOE in the GGU comp, DIG simply waited for GGU come to them, and then used Karthus' superior range to zone and split GGU while they took dragon.

* **DIG properly punished GGU's split positioning.** By chasing Kha'zix back to further separate GGU and then suddenly turning, Tristana was caught by surprise and forced to blow summoners.

* **DIG retreated at the right time.** Though DIG had blown Tristana's summoners, they had used up most of their CC as well, putting them at a temporary disadvantage. DIG took a better opportunity to push instead of forcing a poor engage.

___
###III. Teamfight 6 [33:48-34:05]

**Analysis:**

###[[Images]Teamfight Breakdown &amp; Analysis](http://imgur.com/a/ijbfI#0)


**Key Factors:**

* **DIG's superior AOE punished GGU's engage.** The AOE damaged Ryze and his ghost simultaneously, preventing Ryze from reviving. It took Kha'zix low and prevented the low hp GGU members from following up.

* **Zyra landed her root onto Yorick as well as Ryze.** Though it was mostly luck, as Yorick simply ran straight into it without being forced, the root gave DIG a second kill.

___
###IV. Conclusions From Game 2

Unfortunately, only the second teamfight was really noteworthy in this game, as the other 2 were decided by very simple, uninteresting mistakes by GGU. The second teamfight was well executed by DIG, punishing GGU once they saw the split, and also knowing when to retreat for better opportunities.
___
###V. Conclusions From Games 1 and 2

In stark contrast to the teamfights from game 1, DIG showed strong zone control and situational knowledge, allowing DIG to punish the split positioning and fall back at the right time. The big question, then, is why DIG was able to execute these concepts well in teamfight 5, but not in the previous game. Though it's impossible to know for sure, there were several factors that potentially made the proper decisions much clearer to DIG in teamfight 5 over the previous fights:

1. **DIG was naturally set up to execute choke point control.** In teamfight 5, the Karthus wall was placed between the choke and 4 members of GGU, naturally zoning GGU and letting DIG naturally establish control and punish the split, instead of having to actively enforce it like in teamfight 1.

2. **DIG only needed 1 tank line and it was much more obvious where to place it.** It was clear that GGU's main threat was in the 4 man split so DIG formed a strong tank line against the flank, unlike in teamfight 1, where they were indecisive between 2/3 man groups.

3. **There was no hard engagement**. In the fights from the previous game, Zac's initiation gave a clear signal for DIG to start moving in, which led them to fully commit. Without the same type of initiation, there was no initial target for tem to zone in on.

4. **No GGU members were overly weak.** Similar to the previous point, DIG had less incentive in targeting their all-in focus on anyone because there was no GGU member at low health for them to focus in on.

5. **The disengage was much more decisive.** The Zyra ult created forced GGU straight back and created a much larger gap between DIG and GGU in teamfight 5 than those in teamfights 2 and 3, making it much easier to realize the lack of engage and follow up potential.

In summary, there were less factors that gave DIG an incentive to begin their all-in focus onto 1 target, potentially causing DIG to make the proper moves against the split. Of course, it could also have been a matter of chance, with either game being a fluke, or something else. Whatever the reason, DIG showed markedly better teamfight play in this game than the previous one, and showed they are capable of executing the concepts they failed to in game 1.

There were 2 other potential flags, however, to take note of:

1. **In teamfight 5, DIG grouped tightly into the choke point while chasing Kha'zix.** In this case, it was perfectly safe given GGU's team comp, but was this matter realized by DIG or would they have done the same even if GGU had strong AOE? From my knowledge of DIG, I would tend to give them the benefit of the doubt in this situation, but it is still something to watch for.

2. **A bigger flag, there was clear miscommunication in teamfight 6 between Karthus and the rest of DIG.** The rest of DIG had no intention of engaging until Karthus got caught, yet Karthus kept moving in after he had already zoned with his wall. While it was not a mistake that would have led to anything detrimental in this case, it fits in with a larger theme from game 1 in which Scarra was continually caught out of position.

*

We end part 2 with a more balanced perspective of DIG, as they executed much better overall in the second game of the series. However, there was only 1 teamfight that could be well-analyzed, and there were factors that naturally made it easier to realize the proper moves, which could potentially be the reason for DIG's better play in this game rather than a better active approach from DIG. We will continue to round our perspective on these matters as we examine the teamfights in the final game of the series in Part 3.",,False,,t5_2wenn,1368409064.0,,,True,t3_1e4zmb,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1e4zmb/dignitas_teamfighting_analysis_part_2/,

_________________________________________

**Elise**


*Elise has been rewarded too well for playing safely, so we shifted some of her power to her spider form to increase the reward for taking risks.*

Neurotoxin

* Cast range reduced to 625 from 650
* Damage reduced to 40/80/120/160/200 from 50/95/140/185/230

Venomous Bite

* Damage increased to 60/110/160/210/260 from 50/95/140/185/230


**Janna**

Howling Gale

* Fixed a bug where the knockup duration was not increasing based on charge time
* Knockup duration when fully charged increased to 1 second from 0.75 seconds


**Jarvan IV**

*Jarvan has been bringing too much utility to his team, so we've removed the armor component of Demacian Standard's aura.*

Golden Aegis

* Shield amount per nearby enemy champion increased to 20/30/40/50/60 from 20/25/30/35/40
* Mana cost reduced to 45/50/55/60/65 from 65

Demacian Standard

* Active no longer grants bonus Armor


**Nami**


Tidecaller's Blessing

* Added new visual effects to better communicate the amount of charges left
* Duration increased to 6 seconds from 5



**Singed**

*Singed is intended to be incredibly durable and to gradually burn down his opponents in team fights. By making disables more effective against him and reducing his initial burst damage, Singed’s opponents now have more time and ways to deal with him in these situations.*

Fling

* Damage reduced to 80/125/170/215/260 from 100/150/200/250/300
* Ability Power ratio reduced to 0.75 from 1.0

Insanity Potion

* No longer reduces the duration of disables


**Taric**

*Last patch's changes opened up different playstyles for Taric but did not effectively address his power level. These changes reduce Taric's lane dominance by lowering his burst damage and forcing him to make more tradeoffs when choosing which spells to level up.*

Shatter

* Damage reduced to 50/90/130/170/210 from 60/105/150/190/240
*Armor damage ratio reduced to 20% from 30%

* Magic Resist aura reduced to 25 from 30
* Aura grants an additional 50% Health Regen, Armor and Magic Resist for minions


**Locket of the Iron Solari**

*Locket of the Iron Solari is mainly picked up by junglers and supports, roles that most frequently earn less gold than others, for the team-wide active. We've reduced both the cost and personal stats on the item to lessen its gold impact while preserving its team utility.*

* Combine cost reduced to 520 gold from 670 (total cost reduced to 1850 gold from 2000)
* Health reduced to 300 from 400


**Runaan's Hurricane**

* Combine cost increased to 940 gold from 880 (total cost unchanged)

* Armor increased to 70 from 60
* Ability Power reduced to 30 from 40

**Randuin's Omen**

* Attack Speed reduction reduced to 15% from 20%

**Seeker's Armguard**

* Ability Power reduced to 20 from 25

_______________________________________________
**Runes**


* Continuing our efforts from Patch 3.02 to standardize cooldown reduction, we've slightly buffed Cooldown Reduction runes to provide less awkward stat amounts. For example, nine Tier-3 Scaling Glyphs of Cooldown Reduction previously provided 8.62% cooldown reduction at level 18, but will now provide an even 10%.

* Cooldown Reduction and Cooldown Reduction per Level runes have been increased at all Tiers (varying from 2-35% increase)


_______________________________________________

**Spectator Mode**

* Fixed a bug that would cause the spectator client to crash when using chat commands (ex: /joke, /taunt)


__________________________________________________

**Restricted Chat Mode**


* In an effort to encourage active reform and shield players from toxicity, we’ve implemented a new account restriction that limits in-game chat for toxic players.
Certain players (identified by Tribunal and by Player Support) will have a limited number of in-game messages available and limited access to [All] Chat.
Restricted players that successfully complete matchmade games will earn their chat privileges back.

**General**


* Ready checks no longer return players to the PvP.Net landing page
* ""Random"" has been moved to the top of champion select

Well I would like to discuss the items that tend to be ignored in the Summoner's Rift, anlysing it and trying to find a way to make it viable.

We recently got to see a lot of threads dealing with the new Blade of the Ruined King as it looks like it will become a dominant item for AD carries to build so  as a first topic, I would like to discuss an AD Carry oriented item: **Runaan's Hurricane**.

Coming into season 3, a lot of summoners were looking forward to building it as the passive looked pretty neat and interesting but several months later we barely get to see it used.

A quick reminder:

**Recipe:** *Recurve Bow* (950 G) + 2x *Dagger* (400 G) + Recipe (1000 G) = Total cost of 2750 G

**Stats:** +70% Attack Speed

**Unique Passive:**  Your basic attacks fire minor bolts at 2 nearby targets *(300 range, according to my google researches.)*, each dealing 10 + 50% of your attack damage and applying on-hit effects. **=&gt;Ranged only&lt;=**

A few questions to help you get started:

What do you think of this item (building path, cost, stats, passive, counterparts, good champions to build it with)? 

Were you excited when it got released ? Were you disappointed or did you foresee its lack ? 

Do you use it in serious games ? Would you like to see it tweaked and how ?

I think that this next patch will start a swing which will change the adc meta. 

After a few people have gone about building BRK, it's suddenly become pretty popular, making a lot of appearances in LCS matches. And it's only going to be stronger with the next patch (if it goes in as it is on PBE, for a more clear breakdown as to why it's good, check the above linked thread). 

But the [comments that Doublelift made last week](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CEAQtwIwAg&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Fleague-of-legends%2Fvideos%2Fknow-your-role-ad-carry-with-doublelift-lcs-week-3-6404372%2F&amp;ei=17ksUbLwL5HkmAXnlYGYDA&amp;usg=AFQjCNHWOMwVP9G1S4FeIobMZ2NBO4ZxrA&amp;bvm=bv.42965579,d.dGY) are still valid (to paraphrase: ADC role is dying, it won't exist (in it's current form) in a years time). 

And that's fine, IMO.

Current meta up until a few months ago (and definitely the CLG playstyle) had been to get the AD farmed and let them carry by doing big damage to everyone. 

And then bruisers started to become more dominant. It wasn't enabled by the black cleaver changes, but those changes made it more obvious to all. You can run two or even three bruisers on a team and still work well. Stacking craploads of health is suddenly very effective. Dive onto AD carries and shut them down, not that they can do so much damage to you anyway, right? 

And then I read the post about Quinn and BRK, and the OP's findings of building tanky vs standard. 

I think that this ""tanky"" build is the natural evolution of ADC to combat not only the bruiser meta, but the fact that many team comps are currently based around diving high priority targets (generally the AD). I predict that sooner or later we will start to see more unconventional lane setups in regards to the duo lane (currently support/ranged ADC). 

**Why?**

Most people insist on building their carries glass cannon. At the most they get a warmog, randuins or GA, but generally never more than one of those items. People hate change, if you break the norm you are feeding, trolling, etc. But in actuality, teams don't **need** ranged AD carries. They need **damage** to win team fights. A glass cannon carry who gets dived and can't escape will die quickly or will be totally zoned, and do little to influence the fight. 

But a carry like he lined out? IE, BRK, randuins and a warmogs? That's damn tanky, but still with damage output.

""Ah but it's not as much damage.""

Correct. Glass cannon will always do more end game damage. But thats assuming you stay alive in team fights (you won't, not with the xin's, J4's, Vi's etc on the team). Don't forget that the point is to have damage in the fight, not to play standard. 


**What I'd like to see**

A change in people's mindset. More flexibility in the AD role. 

""Top lane, Jungle, Mid lane, AD carry, Support"". This is how Riot defines the current roles on a team (and it's laid out as such on their lolesports site). 

I'd say that the most flexible players are the ones who play top. They play all types of characters. Tanks, tanky, damage dealers, assassins, split pushers... the list goes on. Sometimes they play in the bottom lane but as the role that is taken on by the top player is a special one (you are isolated from your team, this is true whether you are at top or bottom, as long as you are alone and away from the bulk of your team). 

What was AP mid is now just ""Mid"". J4 mid? Sure, why not .Jayce? NP. Same for Kha'zix. This change and malleability in the mid players is great. 

The jungle is always changing. People fall in and out of favour for no real reason ,as do items. In recent times, Xin has become incredibly popular (since Katovice, i think), as has building locket of the iron solari. Before Diamondprox built that locket, I don't think I had seen one in game for months. Now it is almost a given you will see it in a pro game. nothing much changed about the item (i believe), it's just that one person did it, people saw it was good and suddenly it's the norm. Same thing for Hecarim. Now he is considered  great jungler, but with nothing really changing for him. Lee Sin, who was god tier for oh so long, is suddenly not as popular. No big changes to him recently, it's just the jungle adapting. 

But AD? Not much changing. One example is Doublelift (and let me take this opportunity to say that I think he is an amazing player, I'm not questioning his skill, more his mindset). He made a comment in the above linked video about MF being ""an ulti bot"". And this was said like it was a bad thing. 

So what? It's been working very well for Cop in the LCS, him having played more than a few games on Ultimate reliant champs (MF + Twitch). Sure, it's not as mechanically impressive as killing someone while you run away with amazing stuttering, but whatever works. 

Emphasis on the word **works**. The job is not to be impressive, it's to win. And make no mistake, for the pro's, this is a very real, very high pressure job.

I think that AD players are currently the least versatile. Top and mid play a mix of all characters, junglers can be support orientated, carry or build tanky and supports differ greatly (Sona, Taric, Leona and Alistar, for example, all play very differently). They have it fixed in their mind that they must play the same type of characters each game. 

**Predictions** 

*More lane switches

I'm not talking about top/bottom, I mean mid and bot. An AD and support mid lane can drop mid tower (generally considered the most important of the outer towers) pretty quickly, forcing a mid player without good wave clear to have to swap with their own AD and support. If they don't swap, all things being equal in terms of wave clear, mid tower will drop faster, as it's the shorter lane. 

The advantage in this swap is that IF you can win your lane or get a few kills early on, this early middle tower will give your team a **significant** advantage. 

*Tankier AD carries

With an item build similar to the one laid out in the Quinn/BRK post (BRK, IE, Warmogs, Randuins) an AD would have not only good duelling power against another AD but a huge health boost for teamfights, well as the ability to escape using Randuin active + the proc from auto attacks on randuins. Less glass cannons.

*Solo ad carries mid lane, support with ""mid"" bot lane. 

This one is the biggest change. It might not happen, as it would mean a big change for the AD players. The current meta of having a support with AD makes things a lot easier for them, and allows them to focus on cs'ing/harassing, with (it seems to me) most warding and map awareness coming from their support player. But it's my thinking that an AD carry mid lane can function fine (it was common when I started playing), and a typical AP character (which often have their own CC) in combination with a support (also often having their own CC) would be an incredibly effective bot lane. 


**OK So if this is such a good idea, why wasn't it done until now?**

It didn't need to be. The meta develops to combat the previous meta. This is a constantly changing cycle. When AD's were the best for consistent damage, it was realized that having one player forgo CS to help their AD get super strong was better for the team. 

But currently, that's not really the case, is it? 


I love the idea of this new subreddit, and have seen plenty of intelligent comments and discussions already. I'd love to hear peoples opinions on my thoughts, even if it's only to tell me how crazy I am. 

TL;DR: 

No TL;DR!

        [R] - Mercury Cannon -  No longer has an armor and magic resist reducing proc.
  
Riot's explanation for changes:

 Shifting around his statistics to favor mana regeneration as Jayce should be more of an active laner focused around spells to achieve victory. The shift in regeneration should also compensate for the removal of Mana on Hit from Static Field.

To the Skies! had some early game spike power and late game spike power. Normalizing this curve such that you don't have to stack a ton of early Attack Damage or a ton of late Penetration in order to utilize this ability effectively for burst.

Static Field should encourage Jayce to stay in Hammer form and engage on his opponents for prolonged periods of time while his Cannon Transform is unavailable.

Also experimenting with a W -&gt; R -&gt; W swap combo - though the current gameplay is a little unintuitive.

Thundering Blow in top lane was often Jayce's easy-mode button. If Jayce was in a bad spot - he could simply Thundering Blow to escape. Aggressively gating the Mana Cost on this ability means that eventually, Jayce's second chances will run out.

However, we wanted to preserve Jayce's engagement pattern if he chooses to be active - hence the To the Skies! Mana changes.

Changes on Shock Blast are mostly to increase the dodgability of it, especially from fog of war + acceleration gate circumstances.

The acceleration of gate also favors using E after launching Q - as this will give the opponent the smallest amount of time to react.

Hyper Charge harass becomes more dominating depending on the rank of the spell in a lot of cases. Early ranks of Hyper Charge tend to be less than mana efficient in a lot of ways. These changes are designed to reduce some of obtuse abuse cases of Hyper Charge with IE or priming the skill but to also make Hyper Charge's cost roughly equivalent to its effect.

Jayce brings Acceleration Gate as his primary team utility. The Jayce player should feel confident that his team contribution shouldn't be necessarily gated by his playstyle or what he is forced to build. The cooldown nerfs in 3.9 should control Gate''s spamminess and uptime - and thus the Mana Cost here seems to be unnecessarily restricting him to Mana intensive builds.

This proc effect (on Mercury Cannon) was mostly unnecessary - while it ensured Jayce made it to late game, the combined effect of the proc means that Jayce effectively ignored far too much of his opponent's armor than was healthy.

My opinion on the Olaf changes are that they're a bit much. I get that Olaf hasn't been seen in awhile and that he has one of the lowest win rates in solo queue but people seem to forget how strong he used to be and the problems with him.

People like to point to the fact that the 1v2 with Voyboy was the reason he got nerfed but if you watched some of the old matches from OGN, he was picked fairly often by Shy and others due to the fact that he could 2v1 pretty well by farming with his axes. There was also the fact that he simply built health and HP regen and could trade with you evenly without building much dmg. The main builds on him were stacking HP, building tanky and CDR. Just with that, his ult and ghost he could run at your carry and there was no way to stop him save exhaust which simply reduced the damage he was able to deal out. People like to say ""just kite him"" but he cannot get slowed or knocked back during his ult and the only champion I know who can kite him well enough is Vayne and if you need to pick exactly one champ to deal with another, I think that's pretty problematic.

With the current numbers, I feel that this will simply bring him back to his old state and that trading against him will be even more difficult as now he can trade with E and his Q which has a higher ratio making him a bigger lane bully than he was before. With a lower mana cost for his W and no mana cost on his E and R, I feel his sustain will be really strong possibly making him really difficult to deal against.",,False,,t5_2wenn,1373706201.0,,,True,t3_1i7dqh,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1i7dqh/discussion_about_upcoming_pbe_310_patch_2_changes/,

Last week's Power Ranking above. 


Welcome to another week of the CN LPL power ranking. Remember this power ranking representing the current performance of each team in the league, it is not a measurement of the team power nor it is a ranking of the teams. 


**Rank 1 (+): Invictus Gaming / 14W3L / 1st**

IG remain at the top of the table with another perfect 3 0 week, They look more stable now and players are on form. IG's key strength is the dominating lane phase and it is hard to see too many team able to counter that. In the upcoming week, IG will face huge test throughout the week with SWL final against WE, NGF Qualifier against OMG, and a super weekend in LPL against Royal/We/OMG. 

*Highlighted Player: Xiaoxiao / Support:*

Had a good performance over the past one week, Xx manage to regain some of the faith into his skills rather than only his tactician status. Hopefully he (wont) miss a sona ulti again.

**Rank 2 (+2): Team OMG / 12W5L / 3rd**

3 0 perfect week, beat Royal, and destroy team WE without losing a single tower/dragon, OMG continue to show why they had the expectation from the Chinese fans to be the 3rd Giant of China. No obvious weakness in the lineup and unbelievably stable, it will be no shocking if OMG will be one of the team qualify to the S3 world finals. 

*Highlighted Player: Gogoing / Top*

Gogoing is having a great time, gaining more recognition around and highly respect by other top class top laners. Favour AP top more, he is very flexible in how to build the champion in order to win game rather than stick to one type. A rush warmog on Rumble in the WE game is the great example. 

**Rank 3 (+2): Royal.HZ / 10W7L / 5th**

Still at the 5th, Royal remain the only 2 team beat both WE and IG in the league (another is OMG). Uzi continues to show what a world class ADC he is and other players also perform better and better week by week. Only 2 game away from 2nd, it is not that far to chase and Royal certainly has the strength to try. 

*Highlighted Player: GoDlike / Top*

Godlike is the best Renekton in the world, no doubt. Recognized by both the China and Korean scene and still have 100% win rate in Competitive play with renekton, he will help Royal at least drawing a target ban/pick. Hes capable to play other popular champions too. 

**Rank 4 (-2): Team WE / 12W5L / 2nd**

Bo1 is hard for WE, now we know. Just a joke, but team WE suffered 4 lost in last 6 LPL matches, and another 1 2 finish this week drew more attention on their ability to play in BO 1 format, which is potentially the World final group stage format. Despite heavy favour to be the Number 1 seed of the region and qualify to the quarter final directly in the Worlds, the current status in LPL may turn out it could be other possibilities. 

*Highlighted Player: Misaya / mid*

This is the first time highlighting a under-performing player in the power ranking. Misaya's past performance in last 6 LPL match brought alot doubts to his form and a big part affecting WE's overall performance. We will have to see if he can bounce back in the SWL final against IG and the upcoming LPL week 7. 

**Rank 5 (-2): Positive Energy / 11W6L / 4th**

PE achieved a expected weekend with 2 1 finish but still unable to win against either IG/WE. Their strength and weakness both very obvious and it is hard to expect any big turnaround soon unless another roster change. Jing is world class but even though jungle ca change games, there is still the limit as a jungler. PE need a overall improvement in every lane to be able to go strong in later part of LPL. 

*Highlighted Player: NameI (Devil) / ADC*

China has too many world class adc, and someone like Devil which could easily on top of anyone else at other region, still fighting to be the top 3 AD in China. His performance is no question the key factor for PE. 

**Rank 6 (+): Team LM / 5W12L / 6th**

LM is the only team that can put on some challenge against the top 5 team from the bottom 3, and they have the best chance to remain in the league after end of the Spring season. 

**Rank 7 (+): Wayi Spider / 2W15L / 7th**

Not much to talk about a team full of trouble since week 1. Wish them to at least remain 7th at the end of the season for the Pride. 

**Rank 8 (+): Wings of Aurora / 2W15L / 8th**

WOA can beat any team if opponent doesnt know them or unable to adapt quick before 10 minutes mark. But it is harsh to be in China because the top teams adapt quicker than any other region. But their ""first 10 minutes decide game"" strategy could be useful sometimes for other teams. 

**Highlighted Matches:**

Royal vs WE: http://lol.tga.plu.cn/vod/2013-04-20/9685.html

OMG vs Royal: http://lol.tga.plu.cn/vod/2013-04-20/9701.html

OMG vs WE: http://lol.tga.plu.cn/vod/2013-04-21/9720.html

*(All Vods in Chinese and Qualities are not guaranteed)*

**What Happen Next Week:**

This week 7 of Chinese LoL pro scene contain full of great matchs. Starts with the SWL season 2 Grand Final, IG vs WE for a bo5 which WE got a 1 game up due to Winner Bracket Winner status. The match will play in roughly 13 hours time from now and that is 6 AM ET Tuesday, 23rd April. Follow up is the NGF Group match IG vs OMG on Thursday. And of course, the LPL weekend will have IG vs Royal/PE vs WE on Friday, IG vs WE/PE vs OMG on Saturday and IG vs OMG on Sunday. Full of great actions all week long.

Sup: OMGlovelin

**Allstar voting:**

The Chinese All Star Voting is On going and vote **ending on the 30th of April.** Currently team WE dominated all 5 roles but because of the 3 per team rule, PE.jing (Jungle) and IG.Xiaoxiao (Support) would be the 2nd choice for respective roles **FOR NOW**.",,False,,t5_2wenn,False,,sgs,True,t3_1cvz5x,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1cvz5x/week_6_china_lpl_power_ranking/,

Often I see this comment (and others related to it) about how you shouldn't play ranked if you can't play every role. I wanted to know how people felt about this, because I personally disagree with the statement.

Now, I love league of legends. I watch streams, all the tournament games I can get my hands on, and I will play anything in ARAM and do it well. However...When I play on Summoner's Rift the only role I actually have fun playing is Support. I can ""play"" (understand) other roles, but I don't enjoy them and I don't play them very well partly because of that.

My question to you, is it wrong to only want to play one role and not attempt to play others? I don't think it's fair to tell someone they should only play normal mode until they can do everything when all they want is to competitively play the role they enjoy. On the flip side, refusing to play multiple roles can ruin champion select, but, is it worse to play a role you don't like and not have fun while potentially ruining the game for your team or force yourself into the role you want to play regardless?

Edit: Just to clarify I'm not looking for validation, I want to see how other people approach the game and roles.",,False,,t5_2wenn,1364036906.0,,,True,t3_1auq5e,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1auq5e/you_should_be_able_to_play_every_role_before/,

&gt;Unique Passive - Tenacity: The duration of stuns, slows, taunts, fears, silences, blinds and immobilizes are reduced by 35%.

I personally love this as a 3rd item on almost any strong kiting champ then to also follow up with a Frozen Mallet as a defensive item. Going BT &gt; LW &gt; Zephyr &gt; Phage &gt; PD &gt; finish FM.

The tenacity and CDR makes champs like Graves/Vayne much more comfortable in team fights in my opinion, how do you guys feel about these items as a whole? I know some will say you need to AS/crit from PD. But Zephyr vs. PD goes in favor of Zephyr for the same AS, double the MS, 20 AD and CDR/Tenacity. PD got nerfed into the ground in my honest opinion, you don't have the IE to back up those crits and the MS is very important in team fights in my opinion to keep some more brittle ADC's safe, meaning they have no large escape (MF/Vayne/Graves).",,False,,t5_2wenn,False,,Swain,True,t3_19khen,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/19khen/item_discussion_zephyr/,

**SK Gaming over Evil Geniuses**

Don't worry, I'll cover Giants vs. Wolves and aAa vs. DB later. I just wanted to focus on the Top 4 teams first, and then Bottom 4 teams later, since the Bottom 4 teams will have a big day tomorrow.

SK vs. EG. They know each other very well, and this was a crucial game to determine who'll be looking up at catching Fnatic and Gambit, and who'll be looking back to see if the Wolves and Giants can catch up. 

The Malphite ban by SK was kind of odd, but I suppose that they didn't want to have to deal with a giant rock golem coming toward them. The Anivia and Zed bans are standard against Froggen, and the Kassadin ban against Ocelote, Jarvan ban against SK, and Shen ban against Kev1n were all good ones. Perhaps SK could've banned Lux, but I guess maybe they wanted to face Lux.

First pick Thresh tells you that the bottom lane will be aggressive. Thresh just cannot be a passive support. He has no heals, he has no speed buffs (unless you count the lantern moving a speed buff, which I guess you could). No, he is just a CC monster. Pull you, knock you up, get someone on top of you, and slow you down to a crawl. EG must have known that SK was going to run an aggressive comp. MF+Lulu came out from EG, which, as stated before, can be either an aggressive comp or a passive comp since they both have CC and good disengage. SK then went Volibear and Varus. We've seen the Edward pulling Diamond in the lantern to a flash fling before, so the Volibear pick with the potential fling was solid. Varus provides massive CC as well. Against an aggressive CC comp, EG got Nasus and Akali. The Nasus pick was good because it could slow down that bear from flipping someone over, and Akali could potentially close the gap and assassinate Varus. The next two picks for SK, though, spoke volumes. Twisted Fate and Rumble... I guess Ocelote was finally tired of getting hit by gold cards and decided to throw some instead. And Equalizer is one heck of an ultimate. So, there SK's lineup was, all about crowd control, zoning, and ultimates that really hurt. EG's last pick? Lux. Sniping lasers, Froggen's specialty. 

Akali vs. Rumble is a good lane for Akali, except Wickd got ganked and Kev1n got into a huge lead. Then, the team fights began to happen, and pretty much, the crowd control of SK was overwhelming. Volibear would go in to fling someone, TF would come in to stun them so that they couldn't help but get flung, Thresh would hook then box everyone, and the equalizers did so much damage. That whole time, the champions were stuck in blight and corruption from Varus. The abilities went so well together, and the SK players were so crisp in their synergy and working together. All EG could hope to do was have Wickd go in to assassinate while a Lulu-ulted ulting Nasus tried to fend off the attackers from MF, who was just trying to bullet time. Yellowpete was not able to get farmed up enough to hit the threshold that Genja gets on MF where every bullet time does so much damage. Also, the lack of CC in the EG team hurt in the fact that the Bullet Time didn't necessarily hit everyone. 

SK won against EG simply because SK's composition was built around fighting together, and they forced EG into situations where they could. EG, with assassins like Lux and Akali, couldn't keep up. 

It was a good win for SK, but I wouldn't count EG out just yet. Froggen's Lux was exquisite, and I think they will become better. If there's one scary team in the European scene right now, it is EG. 

Just remember. Twisted Fate's Destiny reveals invisible champions. Kha Zix, Akali, Twitch, Shaco, it doesn't matter. You will be seen.

**Gambit Gaming over Fnatic**

I said in my preview of Week 8 Matches that the only way to defeat Fnatic is to shut down xPeke early. Everyone has known that for a while. Gambit was actually the first team that I've seen in a while to shut down Peke and get Fnatic so down early that they couldn't split push at all.

On paper, Fnatic's team looked very suited to what they usually do. Kha Zix can clear waves fast by Void Spikes, xPeke would do his thing on TF, and with Volibear, MF, and Lulu guarding the base, Fnatic could hold the middle while sOAZ and xPeke split pushed. What they didn't see coming, however, was Fizz.

Now, Fizz was only viable, as Phreak and Quickshot, along with other casters, pointed out, because of the fact that it was the last pick. And Gambit picked that pick to counter TF specifically. Alex Ich actually said in the interview at the end of the match that they farmed TF on purpose. Even if Alex or Diamond (on Nasus) died, it was worth it to stop xPeke from getting items early. In fact, Peke had to go for a Zhonya's before a Lich Bane just because he was pressured so much.

Without split pushing, Fnatic is disjointed. Their comp isn't the best for team fights or defending. Ezreal with Sona? Nearly uncatchable due to Arcane Shift and Crescendo. Nasus? Slows you down completely. Elise? Repel. Cocoon. Game over. 

Gambit finally figured out how a team can stop Fnatic early. You kill Peke at all costs. You have your AD outfarm Yellowstar. And you go for picks that have hard disengages so that you don't get caught out. Most importantly, you don't let up, because once that push starts... It doesn't end.

**So Who's in the Worst Spot Among the Top 4?**

On paper, EG is. They seem kind of lost right now, lost within themselves. Their game tomorrow against DragornBorns will mean tons for this team... 

SK is faring a little better but not out of the woods. A tough match against Giants Gaming awaits, and they can't afford to let up now.

Fnatic wants to keep that top spot, but with Gambit just waiting them to mess up once, while also controlling the Head to Head record, they can't slip. aAa also look to upset them with their new roster.

Gambit will be in a dogfight with the Wolves, who are on the rise. After today, though, I think Gambit can handle anything that gets thrown at them.

1362507039.0,20,self.summoners,19pwg5,"""Barely Protect the Twitch"" - A Theorycraft in the Workings",30,10,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/19pwg5/barely_protect_the_twitch_a_theorycraft_in_the/,"**Intro:**
Hi, I'm iPandaN, and I play ADC for my ranked team, Fusion Blaze. We scrim our Frost/Mist teams daily, and last night we learned the newly formed Mist team loves hypercarries. Today, while engaged in theorycrafting, I listed champions that my teammates play and/or learning. Here's a composition that I came up with as a template for a late-game peaking playstyle which is hybrid of Single Target Surpress and Protect the Hypercarry.

**Example of Composition:**

-Poppy

-Rammus

-Karthus

-Twitch

-Zilean


So at first I struggled with this idea, because of Poppy and Zilean. Poppy's early game is so weak, and Zilean can be tough to pull off bot-lane in some situations, but soon certain strengths became very apparent in this compoisition/playstyle:

-Great Engage, by means of Rammus Powerball and Zilean Q+E (Bombs Rammus)

-Secondary engage from Rammus taunt, which allows for decent Karthus/Zilean AOE dmg to their front line. And Poppy follows up with % Health Damage to the tank line.
-During the initial part of teamfights, when all of the important abilities/ultimates are blown, Twitch is safe, and Rammus should soak up alot of this damage.

-Very good ability to dive the enemy hypercarry. Poppy will dive right when Zilean gets his reset for another Q+E

-Twitch unstealths as soon as rammus pops his secondary initiate. If the tank/AP/Bruiser thereafter dives twitch He should be able to clean up fairly quickly as they've already taken Dmg from Karthus Pool, Rammus Powerball/Taunt, and 1 zilean bomb.

-**If they commit 3 people to diving twitch**, karthus wall will slow all of them alot, and zilean can perma-speed up twitch/ulti if needed. Twitch should be able to take out all of them if they can't gap-close onto him. If they do and he's force to kite them away and gets forced out of teamfight, he can return very quickly from his Q reset/Zilean E. If worst comes to worse, Twitch kills one of the 3 people diving him, get's revived from zilean ulti, and then BotRK Actives/W/Q/Potential Flash to get away and stealth to re-engage and clean up the other two. Meanwhile, Rammus, Poppy and Karthus are diving their ADC/Support.

-**If they commit 1-2 people to diving twitch**, if they are full tanks, twitch should be able to mop them up with no problem, but now your Rammus/Poppy/Karthus are about to fight a localized 3v3. This means that karthus didn't have to blow his wall to peel, so he has an option of Walling the other 3 off from the rest of the teamfight. Because they have a hypercarry, this means they have no gapcloser to quickly return if heavily slowed, Now karthus, Rammus, and poppy can turn back and fight a localized 5v2 briefly until they come and rejoin the fight, which has good chances of turning the fight into a 5v3 where they have no tank line.

-Zilean and Twitch's mobility allows bot lane to easily go up to the bottom jungle to help out if rammus finds the enemy jugler in his jungle, which is a popular counter-play to rammus (Take all of his jungle creeps, all day)

-Versatility in Champion select. I'll explain this in a later section.


**Counterplay:**
-All-in play (such as this) is 9 times out of 10 countered by poke/disengage play. So, A great counter to this scary team-fight potential is disengage immediately after primary initiaton and continual poking. I won't elaborate on this too much as this is really common knowledge.

**Champion Select:**

-In champion select, your first two picks should be Twitch + Rammus. This allows you to subsequently build either **AOE** by adding Galio/Nunu Support, Lux Mid, etc. **OR ""Barely Protect The Twitch""**

-Since these picks do not allow you to play a decent Poke Composition, they shouldn't opt for sustain/siege, sustain/poke, sustian/disengage, or some other variant of sustain play. 

-This means they can go AOE, which should be outplayed by this, as twitch is safe against initial scary bursts in teamfights.

-They can opt for Poke/Disengage, which means their AD carry shouldn't be a hypercarry, so your damage potential is much higher late game, and when they turret siege, your engage is just *too* heavy.

-They can go for split pushing play, which again is risky against such heavy engage.


Also mind you that the champions i mentioned aren't really definite, asides from Zilean and Twitch. Top could be replaced with something like Olaf, and Jungle with another champion that benefits from zilean E as much as rammus, such as Hecarim. So if you pick Rammus + Twitch and see that you can't pull off poppy/karthus against whatever mid/top they pick, then pick some1 else.

I'd really like to hear some feedback/see some discussion of this! If you have any questions leave a comment, and I'd be happy to clarify any confusions you may have!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**TL;DR:** ""Barely Protect the Twitch"" seems to be a great counter to ""Protect the Kog'Maw"" and other hypercarry/late game oriented play, As twitch requires less peel than other hypercarries and Zilean can give all of that to him. Zilean and Twitch also limit counterplay to ramus in the jungle. It is also very versatile in champion select, as you can play two very different styles, and countless sub-styles with your 1st two picks being Rammus and Twitch.

He began his professional career on the TT Dragons but was shafted by the contract for a measly 69 USD a month which also forbid him to join another e-sports team for a six month duration. After leaving the team and saying that e-sports is akin to slave labor, he streamed from an internet cafe since he didn't have the hardware at home to play, when he reached #1 in NA he was playing on 150 ping.

Recently this contract expired. Today Westdoor joins ahq (#1 KR 5v5 ranked team; Taiwanese professional team) and a show match will be played with the S2WC winners Taipei Assassins.

Mandatory Westdoor jokes from Twitch

""God created Micheal Jordan to teach the people of the world to play basket ball, he then transformed into Westdoor to teach the people of the world to play League of Legends.""


""Summoner's Rift use to be a quiet patch of jungle. Then came Westdoor, who scattered three cards into the valley. And so there were three lanes, the Blue card turned into Blue buff, and the Red to red buff, and out of the Gold card Dragon and Baron were hatched.""


""How can you compare Toyz and Westdoor, one is an AP the other is a god.""


""The first thing Westdoor did after he was born was drive his mother back for a nap.""

Apparently this is a troll game where people trying to enrage fans of other pro players, so please don't treat this too seriously!

* Same type of CC immunity that Vi, Noct &amp; Co. are changed to in upcoming patch. No long cooldown ult initiation should be as easy to halt as hers currently is.
* Cure to her itemization issues. New Wit's End is a perfect match for her and most likely covers this part. If not, one way to solve this is higher AP ratios (+0.10-0.25 overall) to make items like Abyssal or Liandry's a real option.
* Flame Breath (E) with shorter/instant cast time, a major QoL issue in ganks and chasing situations.
* Hitbox issues in Dragon's Descent (R). Reliable hit area is far too narrow compared to animation.

I disagree with few of the changes Riot is trying in PBE, like AoE Flame Breath in exhange for lower damage (only the big monster lives after Burnout (W), so it slows clearing for those who can land E on right one) and the slap on ""fix everything"" %HP damage instead of current Armor Shred that provides some team utility, makes itemization smoother (BotRK) and keeps her damage relevant into lategame (the very issue that Scharizard proclaimed they would address). Then there was the Dragon's Descent change to first target hit only and knockback full distance to where she lands... When ganking, the aim generally is to get between her target and his escape route and path block while whacking at them, current live version helps this goal when coming from front or sides and can be saved for later when coming from behind. Changed version on the other hand makes first case moot and benefit to behind gank is quite questionable if they have Flash up. That change also removes some power from clumping effect (for teams AoE), makes it harder to dive carries (brings a tank to peel her) and is much harder to use as an escape (pushes her chaser along).  

note. This started as a comment in r/lol but that post got deleted before I hit submit so if this type of discussion is appropriate, I'd rather post this here.

1375345887.0,20,self.summoners,1jhdvu,7 Reasons Why You Shouldn't Main a Lane (x-post from /r/LeagueofLegends),49,29,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1jhdvu/7_reasons_why_you_shouldnt_main_a_lane_xpost_from/,"This didn't gain much traction over in /r/LeagueofLegends, so I thought you guys might appreciate it more.

Firstly, these first two points raise an issue with terminology in the game, which I feel also impacts on players’ mindsets. Mid and top lane *are not* **roles**, they are **positions**. A **role** is *what you do for your team*. This means that your role could be initiator, or split-pusher, or assassin, poker, disengager, counter-engager, peeler, AoE CCer, bursty or consistent damage dealer, or any mixture of the above. A single champion may play different roles depending on the rest of his team. For example, Zed might be a split-pusher when he’s too strong for anyone to 1v1 him, but on a hard-engage team he might rather play the role of assassin. Or indeed he might fulfill both roles in a single game. Champions have **traits** like initiation, AoE, CC, etc., which can be applied to **roles**, which for the sake of convenience are sorted into a **position**, i.e. top lane, mid lane, jungle, etc.


1. **Being a ‘top laner’ or a ‘mid laner’ doesn’t account the vastly different champions that can be played in those lanes.** AD and AP forms of assassins, tanks, bruisers, CC-trains and pokers are all seen in every lane and jungle, and all play in vastly different ways to each other both in lanes but particularly in teamfights. I play tanky champions like Jarvan IV, Cho’Gath and Zac well in the jungle, but am pretty bad at snowbally assassin junglers like Evelynn, Kha’Zix and Lee Sin. Likewise I play poke champions like Nidalee and Jayce well in both top mid lane, but struggle to get a hang of mid laners like Kassadin and Fizz.

2. **What lane you’re in is only relevant for the first fifteen minutes of the game.** After laning phase is over, how well you manipulate top lane doesn’t matter. What becomes important is how well you play your role in a teamfight. Being good at top lane doesn’t mean you’re good at using a tank to initiate and then zone a carry.

3. **Lanes are hardly even relevant to the pros any more.** And it’s begun to trickle down. Various forms of 2v1 lanes and laneswaps mean that traditional top laners frequently go against traditional midlaners, and that battle may not even happen in top or mid lane, but rather in bot lane! And when we see these pros go into lanes they’re not used to (for example, Wickd has played in mid lane a couple of times, against mid laners like Bjergsen), do they crumble under the superior lane expertise of their opponent? No. We even see swaps like sOAZ taking Blitzcrank support and Yell0wstar going Shen top. More permanent changes like Bigfatlp going jungle and Nientonsoh taking top for CLG have also met with success, though under this culture of exclusively maining a single position you might expect them to have failed in the transition, being inferior to those who have played top lane or jungle for years like Saintvicous and Dyrus. Obviously you’re not as good as the pros, but it’s all relative. *If you are as good or better than your peers in terms of mechanics and game knowledge, you can more or less learn a position to that standard in about a week.*

4. **You get a better perspective on the laning phase as a whole.** You might not think that playing jungle would improve your top lane, or playing top lane would improve your AD carry, but they do. Every role has something to add to the knowledge of every other role, and getting first-hand experience in each of them allows you to take that knowledge to every position. You might become more aware of how and when the enemy jungler will gank, or how to control your lane to be easier for your jungler to gank. You might get a better idea of when the best time to go ward as a support is, or when not to engage because there are too many minions at the turret and losing the CS is not worth it. You might learn from mid lane what makes you a nice easy target to roam to, and how you can prevent that or waste their time. Knowledge about the game as a whole often comes in much more handy than nuanced information about a specific lane, because it’s all about winning the game, not your lane. You can take what annoys you about playing a certain position, and abuse it when you play the other side of it.

5. **You become a more adaptable player.** This is great for loads of reasons. Champion select goes a lot smoother when you are able to play any position. You stop caring about whether or not you can insta-lock mid lane before the other guy, and you start thinking about your team comp versus theirs. What role needs fulfilling on your team? Do you need a tank? Unless you’re playing AD carry, or you like Urgot, you can play a tanky role in any lane, so that’s fine. Do you need someone with good waveclear, but the only position left is support? You could go for someone like Lulu, or maybe direct your team towards another strategy that doesn’t require you to turtle with waveclear, so maybe a Leona or something to aggressively start teamfights. If you were exclusively a mid laner, you would probably just pick whatever support you’re most comfortable with in this situation, since you hardly ever play it, and that could suck for your team comp. It also means you’re harder to be banned out or out-picked. Mid lane and jungle are left on the team. But their mid laner is Fizz and my only counter to him is banned, I’ll just take jungle and gank him often, or I’ll pick a safe laner like Karthus and suggest a lane swap to 2v1 the Fizz. You just get more options when it comes to champion select.

6. **You become a stronger teamfighter.** What I really mean is you become a stronger late game player, which usually (though not necessarily) involves teamfighting. By focusing more on practicing the role you play within the team, you become more effective in teamfights. You might be able to play an unbeatable Riven in a 1v1 lane, but struggle to survive in teamfights. Like myself, you might be able to play an AD carry fine in lane - trading well, avoiding ganks, 2v2 fighting well, pressuring the tower - but suck when it comes to positioning in teamfights. No matter how good you are in lane, how well you play your role in teamfights is *what decides the game*. Only being good at the laning phase just gives you some extra strength with which you can buffer your mistakes or misplays, whereas if you know your *role*, being good at the laning phase gives you that extra advantage with which you become completely unkillable in a teamfight.

7. **You gain Elo.** This may be anecdotal, but for a long time I was a top lane main in Gold V. I would have put my lanes in this order: top &gt; support &gt; mid &gt; AD &gt; jungle. I considered myself a terrible jungler. Then one game I was forced to go jungle, so I thought fuck it Jarvan’s cool and gave him a spin. I had a good game, and though I put it down to luck I played him again because it was pretty fun. 16 wins in a row on Jarvan and 3 on Cho’Gath later, I’m Gold I. Now 18-8 on Jarvan IV, I consider Jarvan one of my most comfortable champions, even though I’d previously despised playing jungle. As I said, it’s anecdotal but I still believe that it’s because I’m good at playing *tanks* and have decent enough game knowledge to learn how to get by in jungle. I would feel comfortable playing Jarvan in top or mid lane as well, because I’m comfortable with the champion and what he can do, and know the basics of those lanes, even though I’ve never played him in either.

So let's do away with this 'mid or feed' nonsense, and stop tunnel-visioning in on the first fifteen minutes of the game. Every position and every role can carry in their own way, not just whichever carried your last game hardest. Main roles and champions, not lanes!

It seems to me that the content creators who are the most focused on creating ""don't be toxic"" content, (athene being a good current example) are typically the most toxic players.

Similarly, those people who are the most toxic on my friends list are often extremely vocal about the toxic players they are queued with. 

personally, I seldom deal with toxic players, and I am confounded by reddit's argument that all of the community is toxic as I don't run into this.

I am highly suspicious of a toxichell actually existing.

I would love to hear thoughts/opinions on this concept and I would really like to see /r/summoners host an AMA from RiotLyte so we can ask legitimate questions of him. The entire tribunal's effect is very interesting to me as it is quite successful in its job from what I have seen over my time on league.

Man, they were awesome :D 

I've got some interesting rankings today, definitely starting to see some interesting ELO divergences and I'm really excited to see how each win/loss affects elo!
Enough of my nerd excitement.  Here ya go!


Week Three - THE GREAT EQUALIZER

| Rank| Team | Win-Loss | Elo Rating | Elo Change| 
|:---:|:-----:|:---------:|:-------------:|:-----:|
|1|aTn|8 - 2|1,282|-11
|2|Gambit|6 - 4|1,223|-45
|3|MYM|6 - 4|1,221|-6
|4|SK|4 - 6|1,190|+43
|5|NiP|4 - 6|1,185|+45
|6|EG|4 - 6|1,176|+9
|7|LD|4 - 6|1,164|+3
|8|Fnatic|4 - 6|1,158|-38

Wow!  What a great week for us stats nerds.  Some points of interest:

* The spread is now only 124 elo.  Last week it was 152.
* aTn went 1-1 but lost 11 elo.  Now we start to see 'strength' of win is becoming important.  It's not enough to win, but you need to win against quality teams! (And if you're the top team, expect those losses to count for even more!)
* **FIVE** teams are 4 - 6 but check out the spread.  32 elo separates SK from Fnatic.  This translates into 5% advantage for SK if the two were to face off.



____________________________________________
_______________________________

Now for next week's predictions!

**Quick Disclaimer:**  Elo is designed to provide a win probability estimate given the difference in rating between two teams.  These estimates are only accurate once teams are near their ""true elo,"" so take them with a grain of salt after only seven games.  In addition, League is a lot more complicated than can be expressed by a single number like elo.  These estimates are to give you a rough idea of teams' relative strengths.

**Week 4 Match Win Probabilities**

|Blue Team|Est. Win%||Est. Win%|Red Team|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Fnatic|40.96%|vs|**59.04%**|MYM
|Gambit|41.70%|vs|**58.3%**|aTn
|EG|**51.79%**|vs|48.21%|LD
|NiP|49.33%|vs|**50.67%**|SK
|LD|**50.89%**|vs|49.11%|Fnatic
|Gambit|**50.30%**|vs|49.7%|MYM
|NiP|36.47%|vs|**63.53%**|aTn
|EG|48.06%|vs|**51.94%**|SK
|LD|41.52%|vs|**58.48%**|Gambit
|Fnatic|32.89%|vs|**67.11%**|aTn
|SK|45.49%|vs|**54.51%**|MYM
|NiP|**51.28%**|vs|48.72%|EG

Really the only thing we know now is that there is a LOT of parity amongst the bottom teams and it's hard to tell who is going to win.  Exciting!!

Leave your thoughts below!  Thanks everyone for your support! :D

**Some Quick Math Notes**

* I did indeed start everyone at 1200 elo.
* I am using a k of 36, slightly on the high side, so that ratings have a chance to diverge over the short season. I am firmly against changing k at any points during the season unless someone can up up with a very compelling reason to do otherwise.
* Win probability estimates are calculated using the following formula: 1/(1+10^((rating of B - rating of A)^)/400 )
* A note to /u/UncountablyFinite: Thanks for helping me work through the issues from last week! Your patience and wisdom are quite appreciated.
* Google Docs spreadsheet available upon request.  Looking for an exceptional person to help me clean the spreadsheet up and come up with a more efficient way to do things.

All the pro players in the LCS scene deserve lots of respect and support as it's not easy being in their position. This is just what I think and what I have observed while watching the matches.

First, I would like to say thank you to all the viewers who read my very first post on Reddit. Thanks to Ocelote for taking notice of me, and to phan2gram for actually asking me to write about EG this time. It's good to know that people read my stuff and appreciate it. It motivates me to write more!

What a start to the week, eh? Six matches, four of them between teams of the Top Four... My predictions came true in four matches (if you count that I said I couldn't call the GIANTS-Wolves match), while there were just solid performances all the way around. Let's take a look...

**Fnatic over SK Gaming**

As was expected, Fnatic vs. SK was a game between a split-pushing team and a team fight-oriented team. Ocelote tried his best to shut xPeke down on his trademark Twisted Fate, but Diana wasn't able to get any pressure on TF. Instead, the combo of CandyPanda on Twitch and Nyph on Sona had way too little health in the early going, and the fact that neither of those characters have any possibility of escaping when they get caught made it even harder for the bottom lane to survive. Peke ganked the bottom lane often, and successfully got YellowStar and nRated ahead in terms of kills, assists, and levels.

I personally liked the Olaf pick for Kev1n because it fit his style - Olaf is just a rock that won't budge, while dealing tons of damage and also having lots and lots of health. However, Olaf was counter-picked by Elise, who does damage based on health, so it doesn't really matter how much health her target has. That being said, most of TF's ganks were in bot lane because Fnatic knew that getting Kev1n was going to be much harder than fighting a Twitch and a Sona.

One part of TF's ultimate that gets overlooked very often is that it provides full vision of one's enemies, even if they are stealthed. This came into play in the later games as well, but it totally negated Twitch's stealthing ability when CandyPanda was caught out. This game snowballed, and got out of hand. Props to Fnatic for showing SK that they still have work to do concerning learning how to shut down the split push.

It can be said that Fnatic actually picked TF due to the fact that Twitch+Sona was revealed right before that pick. It was the perfect pick for such a lane. The MF and Lulu pick that Fnatic had in the beginning were just solid, as the casters said. then, they counter picked Sona and Twitch with TF, and Olaf with Elise. It is said that some games are won in the pick/ban phase, and I must agree that this was the case here. When teams are so evenly matched, every champion pick matters...

**Gambit Gaming over Evil Geniuses**

There is a lot of talk about EG's lineup in this game, and how Gambit just tore it apart. I will not argue that Gambit won solidly. However, I wouldn't bash EG.

The environment of the LCS series is a harsh one. It is a great community of players and they have a lot of respect for each other (especially among Gambit, SK, EG, and Fnatic), but at the end, this is their lifestyle, this is what they do for a living. The concept of a twenty-eight game season in ten weeks means that there is so much time to think of new strategies and new picks. Riot also makes things not easy by having so many patches and new champions, which makes the game more fun but also makes it much harder to master. A pro team must deal with how to handle all this while traveling and being under the scrutiny of the audience. Please, people, don't bash these players. They are trying. Nobody wants to lose. It's just a fact of life that when two teams face, one must prevail. Unless you are constructively criticizing, or unless you're better than these players, do not bash them. They are people, too. They aren't these maniacs that only play games. They have lives, they have feelings, they have dreams... It's sad to see all the flak that they take. Don't complain about them... Support them and cheer for them.

Anyway, to the picks and bans. Anivia and Cassiopeia aimed at Froggen, Jarvan at Snoopeh. Zed against Alex Ich, Elise against Darien, and Thresh against Edward, cause that's just a must. Genja first picks MF, big surprise there (not really) - MF is a caster-based champion, which fits so well into Gambit's playstyle - team fighting. EG counters with Varus and Lulu, which has good push and poke, so wasn't a bad pick at all. Then, though, Gambit kind of took an upper hand. Nasus is Diamond's main, which is to say, he is the one that brought Nasus into the jungle and made it viable. Darien, along with every other top European top laners, play a mean Shen, and the threat of having the Stand United is a great one. These are solid picks regardless of whom they are facing, but EG had a chance to counter pick. 

And they did. Malzahar and Malphite. It did seem like Malzahar could mid, which wouldn't be a bad thing. Malphite could top, in which Shen and Malphite would just bruise each other but not kill without a gank. Gambit replied with Kha Zix and Sona. Sona is a solid pick alongside MF because they can both poke so well. Sona can heal, and if they get ambushed, MF can use the Make it Rain to slow down the enemies while Sona can speed up both of them and heal as well. Compared to the Twitch/Sona lane that SK had against Fnatic, there was a much higher chance of escape by Gambit because there wasn't going to be that teleport that would come, with a guaranteed stun. They might trade summoner spells, but that wouldn't be too bad overall. Kha Zix was actually a very solid pick against Malzahar because he can farm from afar using void spikes and then go leaping all over the place in later levels. 

This, of course, was answered by the final pick: Akali. Then they put Malzahar in the jungle as an AP champion, and Malphite solo lane... And here is where people go crazy on EG. I think that it was a risk that EG took, but it was one that they were willing to take. At their position - 10-8 at the time - they wanted to spring a new lineup against Gambit. Akali is a massive gap closer, and Malphite can just knock anyone up in the air. Malzahar does so much single target damage. The potential was there to kill someone off the map and then fight the rest. The idea was great. It was the application that suffered, and here is why.

Gambit is perhaps the most fundamentally sound team in the European scene. You can't rattle them very easily. They don't seem confused at all about anything that their opponents throw at them. They just go, ""Oh, you're going to do that?"" and deal with it. They do lose, but they always learn and adapt. 

Perhaps against a different team, EG's new system would've worked. But not with Gambit. No, not with Gambit. Diamond showed once again why he is the Nasus innovator... and Alex Ich went to town. The potential was there for EG, shown when Snoopeh and Wickd took down Shen and Nasus very easily in a gank, but Froggen's Akali couldn't get farmed up, while Alex Ich just became a monster. Couple that with the hard CC of a Crescendo that Edward puts so well, and Bullet Time that hits everyone, and... Everyone knows the result. Alex Ich had a Pentakill, and Gambit rolled to a win.

However, don't bash EG for trying something new. This game, this league, is all about adapting and trying new things. Some teams bring new players to shuffle things. Some teams bring out new champions and new compositions. EG was trying to pull a new composition. They just ran it against one of the most fundamentally sound teams in all of League of Legends. In a game decided by microsecond reactions, the discipline that Gambit had paid off.

I think this subreddit is a great idea. It'd be amazing if this turns into a community where we can truly analyze games and discuss competitive teams on that basis, rather than looking solely at W/L record or how ""close"" a game felt or who made flashier plays.

Trying to find an analytical niche community was the main reason I decided to start writing up some in depth analyses of the NA LCS games, which I intend to continue. My goal is to take a very comprehensive look at all the meaningful strategies and mistakes from the games I analyze, and see if I can determine some of the strengths and weaknesses of the teams based off my analysis. 

So far I've written 2 analyses, from the Week 2 games, which I'll share, along with my short thoughts on how the trends I discovered from the two games transferred over to the week 3 games for each team.
___________________________________________________
**[W2D1 DIG vs MRN](http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/18p7nz/indepth_analysis_na_lcs_w2d1_dig_vs_mrn/)**

**DIG**

There wasn't too much I learned from DIG's play in the analysis, other than they were solid, which I already knew. DIG took advantage of MRN's big mistakes and snowballed to an easy victory. There were some small mistakes, but no real consistent trends in a particular mistake. DIG played a single game vs CLG this week, and it was more or less the same. There were more mistakes against a tougher opponent, and Crumbz showed a propensity to initiate too hard with Vi, but overall it was solid play, and there were no big trends I'm willing to point out unless I see it them happen in more than just the one game. There's definitely a lot to improve on, as with all teams, but no single pressing issue to point out as of now.

**MRN**

MRN's biggest flaw in the game I analyzed, which was something I noticed in many of their games, was an overaggressive early game, mostly by the jungler. MRN made strides to improve that this week, mostly by playing very passively in the early game. This isn't exactly the ideal long-term solution to their problem, but it still shows they've recognized they have a problem and are working to fix it. I'd say of the teams of week 3, MRN is in fact the most improved. They are still far from the top and have many other flaws to fix in other areas though. It'll be interesting to see if they've improved their early game further.
___________________________________________________
**[W2D2 GGU vs VUL](http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/18yjs9/indepth_analysis_a_comprehensive_look_at_the/)**

**GGU**

For the analyzed game, GGU overcame a early game deficit with a good teamfight vs VUL in which they made use of positioning very well. A lot of their victory had to do with VUL stagnating the mid game and being baited into the teamfight however. For week 3, GGU looked very weak, especially in their teamfighting. One thing I had noted, their dragon control/awareness, was also very spotty. The coL game, in particular, featured extremely poor play in many aspects that blew their lead, after a good early start. Definitely a weak showing for GGU in both play and results, and no real improvement.

**VUL**

VUL's biggest mistakes in the analyzed game was a poor mid game approach and bad teamfighting, especially in initiating. In week 3, vs CLG, they played a better mid game. I have to think a big reason for their stagnation vs GGU was an unfamiliarity with the push comp, along with having Singed instead of Renekton to attempt their split push. The teamfight they had was very disorganized however. Vs coL, the also showed weaknesses in teamfighting, given the lead they had. There were also times they failed to transition from a fairly stagnant position in the mid game once again, though their lead was huge enough that it didn't even come close to mattering. Vs MRN, a teamfight at drag and a catch top into a baron rushed the game past the mid game. The teamfighting was a mixed bag. Overall, VUL played better for week 3, but not by too much. They certainly played much better than they did against GGU, but their play against GGU was probably not a true representation of their abilities. Still, the weaknesses they showed against GGU showed in week 3 too. I would not call them ""on fire"" based on their play like the casters did, despite going 3-0.",,False,,t5_2wenn,1361930259.0,,,True,t3_19a8fa,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/19a8fa/in_depth_analysis_series_for_the_na_lcs/,

1376334539.0,17,self.summoners,1k83n1,Improving Masteries for Season 4 (xpost r/lol),21,4,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1k83n1/improving_masteries_for_season_4_xpost_rlol/,"Currently, masteries come in two types: statistical optimizations lending a small boost to your character's most relevant stats (e.g. Mental Force, Tenacious), and more situational buffs that are generally stronger but only represent their strengths in certain moments of opportunity (e.g. Executioner, Pickpocket). Stats are useful but lend power without much visibility and therefore are suitably limited. By linking masteries more strongly to game play and to your champion’s situational opportunities in a game, they can be given more strength and help provide new opportunities to players.

In season 4, masteries could be further improved by increasing effectiveness of the second variety in order to enhance players’ positions on their teams or their roles in a strategy. Further tuning the stat optimization masteries will help some less utilized masteries become viable alternatives to the current popular choices. There are undoubtedly some potential negatives to this direction as well, primarily the possibility of limiting a player’s game play opportunities prior to the start of the game.

Below are a some suggested changes and optimizations incorporating situational power to demonstrate how players and game play could benefit.

_________________________________________
Offensive masteries are intended for **Primary Damage Dealers (Marksman, Assassins, Fighters), and Secondary Damage Dealers (Mage Supports, Junglers)**

http://i.imgur.com/sAIQJAC.png

##Remove Summoner’s Wrath
- Shift the bonuses for each summoner spell onto the spells themselves and remove this uninspiring, one point necessity. Alternatively, the additional bonuses could be metered out to other masteries individually.

##Swap Brute Force and Fury and buff both, remove Frenzy
- 4% Attack speed is underwhelming for most champions, not providing enough attack speed to make a difference in all but very sustained fights. Champions that do itemize for attack speed often skip Fury in favor of Sorcery or Butcher. Moving it to a higher mastery tier allows us to slightly buff it in order to make it worth the point investment. Brute Force, a mastery that is almost universally useful, would be better positioned as a viable alternative to Sorcery in the first tier. Fury granting a higher attack speed necessitates the removal of Frenzy, a mastery that is adopted mostly by Marksman. Its impact is rather situational, which is difficult to recognize and appreciate by many players.

##Split Havoc into auto attack and ability based versions
- Havoc suffers first of all for its limited power. 2% of 2000 Damage is only 40, less than the level 1 base Attack Damage of most champions. However, it is often chosen despite that weakness because it also suffers from a lack of competitive alternatives on the same tier. Havoc could be replaced with a stronger “percent damage buff to only basic attacks” and would appeal to Marksman and Fighters. We can add another mastery in a lower tier to add “current percent health as bonus magic damage to spells” as a more flavorful way to enable a damage boost which gives extra value to Mages and Supports attacking tanky targets while limiting its use to most Fighters.

##New offensive support mastery

- Currently, Supports looking to be secondary damage dealers (typically mage supports) would invest a maximum of 9 points into offense, which happens rarely. Adding in a new mastery at the 9 point level that grants bonus damage on allied attacks against enemies affected by the Support's abilities can better reward aggressive Support players that is linked to cooperation with their teammates in order to realize the benefits.

##New mastery for fast jungle clears

- Junglers (Fighters, Assassins) willing to invest deep in the offense tree could benefit from a mastery intended to help them clear quicker. An attack speed buff enabled only while attacking monsters should help accelerate their income and give them higher flexibility to skirmish more freely and utilize their strong damage potential instead of just farming.

_________________________________________
Defensive masteries are intended for **Primary Tanks and Fighters, as well as tanky Supports and Junglers, and to a lesser extent any champion looking for small boosts in early survivability.**

http://i.imgur.com/YyOSplm.png

##Remove Summoner’s Resolve
- Shift the bonuses for each summoner spell onto the spells themselves and remove this uninspiring one point necessity. Alternatively, the additional bonuses could be metered out to other masteries individually.

##New defensive support mastery
- Like the offensive option, Supports have no unique opportunities when investing into defense. A mastery could provide a buff for a greater boost in defensive stats or perhaps a small shield whenever that player CC’s an enemy. This would be especially useful for the likes of certain supports and tanks who tend to initiate fights or bully enemies.

##Rework Perseverance into a new mastery for safer jungle clears
- An alternative to the offensive jungle mastery for Junglers investing deep into defense (support tanks), this should provide tanky Junglers extra safety while clearing camps. This takes the principle of “HP regen per missing health” and fixes it into an increase of the healing buff that large monsters give whenever they are killed.

_________________________________________
Utility masteries are intended for **Primary Supports and some Mages, as well as some Tanks and Junglers**

##Remove Summoner’s Insight
- Shift the bonuses for each summoner spell onto the spells themselves and remove this uninspiring, one point necessity. Alternatively, the additional bonuses could be metered out to other masteries individually.

##New Initiator mastery
- For deep investment, provide a small flat movement speed buff while moving towards an enemy champion (mini Vayne passive) for champions who specialize in ganking and starting fights. This would help lessen certain champions’ mobility limitations or dependencies on Flash in order to become effective, reliable initiators.

##New CC based Mage mastery
- This new mastery would be in line with the other suggestions that provide novel ways for Supports to contribute to their team’s damage or their own survivability. It would be a useful way for Mages with CC to advance that particular strength when investing more points into the utility tree as an alternative to offense. Anytime you CC an enemy champion with an ability, all your cooldowns are reduced by 2% of their total cooldown.

##Rework Scout
- Extra vision range for wards has been a largely underwhelming option, even considering its position early in the utility tree. Switching up its purpose to act as another way to combat the vision burden from supports would make it a far more competitive choice when positioned deeper in the tree. Scout could instead reduce the cost of wards by 25 gold; or if sight wards are reworked to be purchased in packs of 2 per player every three minutes, scout could allow purchases of packs of 3 instead.

##Move Vampirism to Defense
- Both Life Steal and Spell Vamp are essentially methods for sustain--active game play linked ways to regenerate health. Oddly positioned in the middle of the utility tree, it’s only an opportune choice for a small subset of classes and not even available for the classes who could most benefit from the sustain like Marksman, Fighters, and Junglers with making substantial sacrifices in primary trees. Lifesteal quints as well make the options seem even more obsolete. Shifting it to a lower tier in Defense can set it as an alternative to the flat heath and mitigation options that are otherwise mandatory choices.

Those of us who have been playing for a while will recall how both support and jungle used to buy multiple gold generation items because it was the only way to stay somewhat relevant if the game went to lategame. Thankfully, Riot made changes to the game that improved income and item efficiency for the two poorest roles. When I play support I even get to complete a major item before the game ends most of the time!

However, I'd argue that not enough changed. Both support and jungle are falling back into certain playstyles and items. The most efficient strategy is a jungler that buys Ancient Golem and Bulwark, and at a competitive level there is the worrying trend of junglers getting Philostone and supports buying nothing but vision items and consumables...

I see no problems with the jungle and support having access to slightly more gold, it would make them more relevant in team fights and it might make damage-style junglers more viable once again. More importantly, having more gold would make these unpopular roles more fun to play. Sadly it seems as if Riot hasn't found a way to do this without it backfiring yet. Just look at the patch history for Spirit of the Elder Lizard, and laners are still buying that item...

**So here's my proposed solution for the support role:**

It would be a new, cheap item with the following passive:

""You receive 5 gold every time you gain xp from an enemy you didn't kill""

This would put its optimal gold generation at twice that of Philostone, without making it attractive to buy for any other roles! To solve the problem of slot efficiency it could have a small amount of mana/health regeneration and replace one of the components for philostone, or it could be a new component for Sightstone. The passive would be kept when upgrading it (though not necessarily for all the upgrades from philostone).

**For junglers:**

Machete and its upgrades would get an additional passive that grants a small amount of gold on monster kills. This amount would have to be small enough for machete items not to be a good investment for anyone other than the jungler.

I've been playing League of Legends since the release of Kennen (April 2010), and I'm currently rated Gold III.


I've recently been focusing much of my efforts on expanding my Champion pool. I've been playing the same champs for awhile, and though I am not currently on Diamond level, I believe I have sufficient skill with most of them so that I can afford to broaden my horizon. My goals in doing this are two fold:


 - have more options to counterpick/complement team comp


 - Expand my knowledge of each champion even more so that my understanding of the game will increase, allowing me to advance to higher levels of play.


Please bare with me as I know that I do not have as much knowledge as many of you, however I feel I understand enough to make a significant contribution to the discussion.


Undoubtedly, we have all noticed the some-what narrow champion selections in many games. Each lane has its fair share of every game picks/bans. Where I used to be surprised by a volibear/nasus in jungle during season 2, it's now almost expected to see them picked or banned. This of course has to do with the changes to items, masteries, and general formatting of the jungle. 


The change in influence these champions bring to the table has caused many of the previously deemed go-to champions to become less used, inferior, or even seemingly obsolete. 


I would like to discuss Shyvana who has fallen from grace as it were in the professional scene. 


Please note that though she may have been picked in LCS games, I am basing this thread off the notion that she is not NEARLY as popular as a Nasus, Voli, Cho, Xin, J4, or Elise (or any other that you see with specific comps).


Lets get started!


- **Shyvana**: The previous Queen in all her glory and favorite of many junglers seems to have run into a rut as of late. As an avid shyvana lover, I find myself looking downheartedly at her portait in champion select reminescent about the good times. With a strong clear time and strong counter jungling, shyvana can be the cause of excessive advantages over the enemy unsuspecting jungler. An excellent team fighter, Shyvana excells in diving carries, applying immense pressure to entire zones of the fight, and detering dives not by hard CC, but by sheer damage potential. In general, you don't mess with a farmed shyvana unless you're confident you can out manuever her.


So whats the problem? Why isn't she seen very often?


The answer everyone says upfront is that her ganks are trash. She doesn't bring anything to the table with a gank other than damage output and decent chase. If the enemy has an escape, she's at best blown a flash, at worst wasted her time.


My theory however is the main reason Shyvana is less useful currently is the lack of complimentary picks, not her individual kit.


 Just as a Volibear loves ganking a Leona/Graves lane due to the ridiculous burst and CC, a Shyvana does extremely well in ganks when complimented with a high cc champion. Shyvana ganking a lane with an allied Rumble? unless the enemy is low health, chances are they get away. However, Shyvana ganking a Shen/Elise/J4, the kill potential skyrockets as the enemy is CC'd upfront, followed by the Shyv's Exhaust.


- **Team Fighting Issues**: When a Shyvana gets behind, just as many champions her team fights become less powerful. When under farmed, Shyvana is a threat, but little more than a zoning champion who is easily kited with the right Carry and Peel. Any shyvana player knows the annoyance of trying to dive onto a Trist/Ez/Cait only to be stopped mid air by a thresh, get knocked back by a cannon ball, slowed by a 90 caliber net, or laughed at from over a wall.


So what do we do? What tool could be used to get her back up to snuff?


The answer lies in team comp. 


Certain junglers have so much reliable CC and base damage that it almost doesn't matter when you pick them, they will always bring utility to the table. Shyvana is NOT one of those champions. With the right team however, a Shyvana coupled with a team mate can be the single reason a game is won.


An excellent and somewhat classic example of this lies in Orianna. I personally have 2 v 3'd and 2 v 4'd an enemy team with my AP carry teammate playing orianna. The synergy in diving into the enemy with Ori ball, only to have the ball pop in 2 Strong AOE moves, 1 of which pulls them in closer, and then for these unlucky champions to be hit by Burnout, Flame Breath, and Twin Fang unloads RIDICULOUS damage in the space of a couple seconds. Couple this with a rumble ult, Leona ult, and Varus/MF ult and you'll be watching the fight go from a 5 v 5 to a 5 v 3 or 5 v 2 almost instantly, especially if you catch them in the jungle or at a dragon or baron.


Another viable option is with a Shen top lane. As you go to ult, Shen will pop Stand united to help shield from initial burst, and join in your diving frenzy after you're descent. His aoe CC has a fairly strong potential to taunt 1-2 champions if positioned correctly. The intial damage the 2 of you will do will be enough to at the very least push the enemy out of the fight for those few precious moments to allow your team to turn and fight the other enemies 5 v 3 (as long as your carries have strong peel/selfpeel to avoid the dive of their front line).


**Problems with this**


Some of the issue with these comps is that many times, especially in a solo queue setting, you will not get this kind of coordination. You will be lucky as a shyv to have 1 champion that compliments your need to dive into the fray and wreck the enemy carries. And many times, even when you do the coordination is just not there. 


To close this off, My question to you all is what other champions/team comps could offer Shyvana the maximum potential for influence in a game? She has the kit, however she needs the comp.

I'm not level thirty yet but my W:L is putting me against current Gold players. Some people have decent lane mechanics, so it's not a free win every game.

1) Quinn is probably the best champion design visually / thematically in the past year. Vi is too 'fan service' for my liking, Zed has potential but it feels like the lack of lore really hurt him, and everyone else is just *boring*. Quinn has global voice lines which I think are sorely lacking in 90% of the champs in this game. The last champ with this treatment was probably Jayce (POWER SLAM!). No complaints here. Awesome design. *Gouge 'em Valor!*

2) Quinn is built around her passive. Her passive is high risk, you *have* to use it else it goes on CD for ten seconds, and you lose a lot of damage. Furthermore, it's best to use it before casting E, else you lose the 2nd proc. Wait for Valor to mark a  target, AA, E, AA, Q, engage. Do this proficiently (relying on your support, especially hard CC like Taric, helps) and you'll mathematically come out in trades against every AD in the game, *including Draven* (thanks to the blind). 

Quinn's passive *will* target the last champion hit. Try to poke their AD or squishy supports -- but this discourages ever attacking a champ like Taric or Leona in lane...you will lose a lot of DPS, and trades, if you try to proc -&gt; E -&gt; AA their tank support.

3) Her blind is great against autoattackers: Draven, Kog, Twitch, Ashe, to a degree MF (if the MF maxes W). 

4) Her sight aura (W) has a prohibitively long cooldown. Don't use it to check for jungle ganks, use it to pre-check a brush you're running into, else save it for trades where they duck into the unwarded lane brush.

5) Her E is hard countered by Singed, Volibear, Udyr, pretty much anyone with targeted powerful CC that is low range. If you are trying to escape a Singed, you can't with E you'll need to pop ult and try your luck at running away. 

Her E is only an escape if you have your back to the wall and E an enemy at a perpendicular angle. This is very easy to do in the dragon pit, try it.

To use E as a gap closer, get between your enemy and a minion, then use it like a Caitlyn E. This will cut your damage heavily though.

6) Her ulti is too weak for what it is (or, more likely, other ults are too strong). It's an execute that has less base damage (even on 5% HP enemies), less range, longer cooldown, lower AoE than Graves' ult. The value is using it as a steroid in an engage that is 1v1 ""either you do, or I"" all-ins. **You lose her passive while ulting**. This is one of the most frustrating parts of the ult. If you get two passive procs off (one proc then an E AA), you lose damage since the execute is so weak.

7) Her Q has a terrible animation in ult form. Hard to notice. No added benefit. Less effective range (in terms of damage) because you take up part of the AoE. In my opinion this is one area she needs to be changed: double the Q range in ult form.

8) Her ulti is prohibitive if the execute damage doesn't kill the target. You gap close, cast Q, an AA or two, then attack -- but after ult form is down your Q/E are still on CD. IMO this could use the Rengar treatment, in that his 5-stack abilities can be double cast.

Anyway. I'll think of more later after I get more than 15 games in with her. Thoughts?",,False,,t5_2wenn,False,,gambit,True,t3_1aws87,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1aws87/my_thoughts_on_quinn_and_some_suggested_changes/,

Does  this information not exist or have I just missed it?

This past weekend Could 9 and Velocity esports won a spot in the NA LCS May Promotion Tournament.  Two teams for the EU will earn a spot in the EU LCS May Promotion Tournament this weekend when the LCS travels to France.  The promotion tournaments promise to be incredibly exciting as challenger teams battle to make it in the LCS and established teams fight to keep them out.

The only issue is Riot has told us precious little about these matches.  The [F.A.Q.](http://na.lolesports.com/season3/split1/about#tabs=3) on Lolesports.com tells us how the bottom 4 LCS teams are selected, and that they will be pitted against “rising stars from amateur ranks.” The bit about rising stars is pretty poetic but it doesn’t tell us how these stars are selected or how many of them will play. 
 
Questing for a riot response I eventually ended up at [this reddit ama](http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/169tp6/season_3_league_of_legends_championship_series/)  RiotMagus says, 
&gt;The bottom 4 teams after the first half of the season will have to play their way back in. There'll be a 16-team promotion tournament during the All-Star break - 8 challenger teams, 4 teams from the partner events, and the 4 bottom LCS teams.

So 12 “rising stars” 8 of the Challenger Teams, and 4 from partner events.  Great! I assume that Challenger Teams are teams coming from Challenger Tier, and there is a bunch of information on how those are selected at lolesports [“Become a Pro.”](http://na.lolesports.com/season3/split1/about#tabs=1)  

Unfortunately it’s conflicting.  First the page says that top 32 Teams will compete for 4 spots in the promotion tournament.  Then further down it says the top 16 teams will play for 4 spots.  I have no idea whether it is 16 or 32 and both say that 4 Challenger Teams Qualify, not 8. 

And then what are the partner events?  Flipping through tournament information pages and hoping that one of them mentions it seems the only way to find them.  IPL 6 was going to be one, but I can’t seem to find any more information about them.  

Am I missing something really obvious? I just find it hard to believe Riot has left us hanging related to this important event.

For targets I now used 3 full build targets. A very squishy champ, the tankiest ADC, and a tank. All these targets also used magic resist per level blues and armor yellows. For the squishy target I chose Zyra who had Liandry's Torment and Zhonya's Hourglass as health and defensive items with [9 points in the defensive mastery tree.](http://i.imgur.com/cvpQB5J.png) Her health, armor, and magic resist at level 18 were 2125, 133, and 56 respectively.

For the tankiest ADC I used Graves who had his passive fully stacked and had either Guardian's Angel or Randuin's Omen as a defensive item. He also had [9 points in the defensive mastery tree.](http://i.imgur.com/cvpQB5J.png) His health, armor, and magic resist at level 18 were 2060, 170.6, and 102 for GA and 2560, 190.6, and 62 for Randuin's.

For the tank target I chose Shen with Armor boots, Sunfire Cape, Locket of the Iron Solari, Spirit Visage, Trinity Force, and either Warmog's or Randuin's as his last item. He also had [22 points in the defensive mastery tree.](http://i.imgur.com/ac0uF6W.png) I did apply the 2 less damage from all sources (except for true damage), 3 less damage from all AA's, 10% less crit damage from all sources (this includes Master Yi's Q), and 3% less damage from all sources (except for true damage). Shen's health, armor, and magic resist at level 18 were 4675.84, 170.6, and 113.475 with Warmog's and 4155.84, 261.3, and 113.475 with Randuin's.

When calculating the damage from items, actives, passives and whatever else was there I did include Q's damage, BotRK's active damage, and Shiv's damage all the time if applicable. However for Q and Shiv I did two separate calculations for if they did or did not crit since you Q once at the beginning before you auto attack them and since Shiv only procced once during all the fights (Yes, everybody died in under 10 auto attacks).

After all that pre-explanation here is all the data I collected: http://sdrv.ms/12QhWBB

**TL;DR:** If you want to kill a lower health/armor target go BotRK with either PD or Shiv with Armor Pen reds. If you want to kill a tanky ADC without Randuin's go BotRK with either PD or Shiv. Reds don't matter here. However if the ADC has Randuin's go BT with PD and Armor Pen reds but only if your Q crits. If your Q doesn't crit then go BotRK with PD. If you want to kill a tank with or without Randuin's go BotRK with PD and Armor Pen reds.

**TL;DR of the TL;DR: Run BotRK, PD, and Armor Pen reds on Yi.**

Now here are the results:

**KEY:**  
BRK = Blade of the Ruined King  
BT = Bloodthirster  
PD = Phantom Dancer  
Shiv = Statikk Shiv  
AD = Attack Damage Reds  
AR = Armor Pen Reds

Remember Q and any actives are applied first before auto attacks.

(x-post from /r/leagueoflegends),14,0,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1gye9a/38_changes_on_khazix_discussion_xpost_from/,"For those who are unaware, Riot changed Kha's W, evolving it no longer consumes his passive to apply the extra damage, and you can't cast W while leaping anymore. His Q got some tweaks and is now his main source of damage. Finally his R got buffed, now Kha gets 50% damage reduction instead of 40% while on stealth.


Ok, now that you know that, to the text:


I've been playing Kha'Zix since he came out, I thought the idea of evolving your abilities was pretty cool.
When the changes to Kha'Zix kicked in the PBE, even tho I don't play in the PBE server, I was very excited. Of course a lot weren't very happy but others started posting and commenting about how the changes were going to make other evolution routes possible, and the red posts, I was pretty damn excited. But I feel like they just changed the viable route to Q&gt;E&gt;R/W instead of W&gt;E&gt;R/Q.


**Thoughts:** I think that Kha feels more like an assasin now, and that his W is pretty useless, unless you find yourself playing a front liner/tank or a splitpusher, but evolving his W you would have to sacrifice evolving other ability which would harm his full potential, for example his R now helps him getting in and out of fights more effectively and making Kha more durable while doing more damage thanks to being able to toggle his ult and getting his passive one more time, or his Q which is his main source of damage, and in my opinion not evolving his E is unforgivable because it greatly increases his mobility. What are your thoughts?

**EDIT:** Formatting.

Just did some quick math:

Judging from current standings, it actually might work in favor of Curse to take 2nd place because then they'd be taking on 3rd/6th instead of 4th/5th. Assuming the standings don't change drastically: 

* the 1st place team would be facing CLG vs. GGU
* the 2nd place team would be facing DIG vs. VULCAN/MRN/COL.

Curse's current record against teams:

* CLG: 2-2
* GGU: 3-1
* DIG: 2-1
* Vulcan/MRN/COL: 3-0 for all teams

This is just from game data so far. With the player changes, the bottom teams have been showing some great performances, and they've already shown that they can upset any of the top 4 teams.

I made a roster history of the big 4 teams in NA - TSM, CLG, DRs and DIG. To be honest, there might be minor mistakes. I added EPIK as well, but didn't took their entire roter hitory.

I think it would be great if someone with the ability and tie could maybe make a website, of course adding EU/Asia would be nice, as well as ""job changes"" like going to Riot (Kobe or Jatt) or coaching (like Liquid). 

But first, I want to know what you think about because it's quite some work digging through team histories and finding out who actually played what back in 2010.

1365469845.0,14,self.summoners,1byiof,Week 4 Chinese LPL Power Ranking (spoiler),15,1,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1byiof/week_4_chinese_lpl_power_ranking_spoiler/,"Last Week's ranking: http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1bd48o/week_3_chinese_lpl_power_ranking/


**Rank 1(-): *Team WE* / result 10 1 / 1st place**

Team WE continue to show they are just too stable and too hard to beat in the league. Not only able to get the results they want, they also do it in dominating fashion. This week WE had faced 2 mid-tier teams in OMG and PE, both game had went pretty one sided after WE engage into a well-timed teamfight. The only possible for WE to lose is themselves for now. 

**Highlighted player: *WE.Fzzf* / support**

We all know everyone in WE can be the key factor in any game. This surely included their support player in Fzzf. He played only Elise this week, in all 3 games, and almost became a solo-lane elise at one point in each game. His timing and mechanic are surely big part of WE's 3 0 finish this week. 



**Rank 2 (-): *Invictus Gaming* / result 9 2 / 2nd place**

IG lost another game, and again it is not against WE, made people wonder if their stability is a problem. As all the hypes and expectations surrounded the team for the past 2 weeks, IG again shows their over-risky plays can sometime backfire really hard. Even though IG still is the only team that could test WE's domination in China, but it seems time still needed for the team to find the balance between win the game and kill the game. Xiaoxiao need to be more accurate with his famous ultis and illusion should never be a real shadow in his games. 

**Highlighted player: *IG.Zz1tai* / mid**

As the no.1 ranking on the MVP chart, again Zz1tai catch all the attention this week. His unbelievable powerful Karthus, tricky pick Annie and passive pick Orianna this week shows only that he has just too many bullets in his gun. Whatever champion he pick hes able to perform to a high level that is at least okay for competitive play but what he need is that his shoulder need to be harder and tougher so he can carry IG even when they are behind. 



**Rank 3 (+2): *Royal.HZ* / result 6 5 / 5th place**

Even though Royal still is only 5th place, but their 3 0 finish this week, included wins against OMG and IG has really pull them back into the league. Only 1 game behind OMG after an impressive week, Royal must maintain their current form into next 2 weeks in order to fight for the top 4 finish. 

**Highlighted player: *Royal.Uzi* / adc**

When more and more people try to convince you that Uzi is actually better individually compare to Weixiao, eventually you may convince yourself that this 16 year old kid is a monster. Not only able to farm and out farm, hes doing his best to improve his big teamfight presence, and with this young age, you can only fear that another monster adc is in making to haunt the world of LOL, again from China. 



**Rank 4 (-1): *OMG* / result 7 4 / 3rd place** 

OMG has a less impressed weekend with a 1 2 finish. Not only lost to WE which people does not expect the opposite result, but again fail to take the point from Royal shows they still have alot hard work to be done in order to stay top 4. Being the team that has best record in scrim against IG and WE, OMG will need more official success to remove their current title: King of Scrim. 

**Highlighted Player: *OMGlovelin* / support**

Continue to stay at 2nd overall ranking on the MVP chart of LPL, lovelin's impressive support play raised his reputation greatly in the past 4 weeks. His combination with OMGSan has great foundation and lots of potential, hopefully both can improve to another level after more games played in the highest level. 



**Rank 5 (-1): *Positive Energy* / result 6 5 / 4th place**

PE has drop 1 place on the power ranking only because Royal's impressive weekend performance. Despite unable to give any challenge to WE, PE still net a solid 2 1 finish this week. Not only maintaining their games in LPL, their wonderful win against TPA in SWL in mid week also extend their fanbase reach. PE vs OMG vs Royal would be another intensive battle of 3 - 5 ranking in LPL. 

**Highlighted player: *PE.JingGG* / jungle**

Even though Jing was unable to test clearlove in the WE vs PE game, in all other games since he join the team, Jing was able to pull out MVP performance. His aggressive jungle play and hard engage determination fit into PE's current team com, and improve the general performance in every lane. Expect more target ban on Jing in next few weeks. 



**Rank 6 (-): *Team LM* / result 3 8 / 6th place**

Failed to win any game this week, included a lost to the last placed Spider, LM make its way to join the other 2 bottom teams in a fight of relegation. In the game against Spider, both side has made numbers of mistakes that could hardly see in the highest level of Asian games and only to lose by making more mistakes is nothing too good to think about. If LM unable to get any result from the other 2 struggling teams, they may seriously in trouble and could face a tough fight in the relegation battle. 

Highlighted player: none



**Rank 7 (+1): *Wayi Spider* / result 1 10 / 8th place**

Finally achieve their 1st win of the season, Spiders do not look anything too impress still. Even though no one still think they could achieve some crazy result like beating IG in the qualifier, but they could already too far from being in a safe spot. If nothing change still in next 2 weeks, they may just continue to struggle and never look like a team to expect any results. 

Highlighted player: None



**Rank 8 (-1): *Wings of Aurora* / result 2 9 / 7th place**

WOA got destroyed by WE and IG in last 2 weeks, shows that their individual skills and team overall skills are so lacking behind compare to the mid-tier 3 teams. Any expectation above 6th place is over-rating and hopefully they can pull out cheese plays like what they did in week 1 and 2 so that they are actually fun to watch at least.

A well-timed barrier can render a 3v1 dive useless, especially when combined with a red elixir. Exhaust can also play the role of barrier proactively by gimping someone's damage. Additionally, exhaust is one of the best scaling summoner spells in the game, so it wouldn't hurt to take it over ignite. 

I know a lot of players are running teleport, but I just don't think that's the right call. What is teleport going to do for you when you get 3v1 dived and die/lose your tower and lose a ton of exp? Sure, you have more map mobility/presence, but you don't at the same time because you got asspounded at level 1/2 in laning phase. It's going to take time for you to recover from your farm deficit.

1362622464.0,16,self.summoners,19tgm0,Let's talk Malzahar,17,1,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/19tgm0/lets_talk_malzahar/,"Greetings everyone,

I am Drothdarr, a League of Legends player like you, and I am here to discuss Malzahar. Malzahar is one of my favourite characters, I love his capabilities of both farming and dueling, and hist 1-hit-combo playstyle. Now, as we all know, he is not in a very good shape in the competitive scene, maybe because he is forgotten, has an outdated kit, or simply just doesn't fit the current meta. 
Back in Season 1, Malzahar was one of the most contested champions in the pool, back in the AP top meta, because of his excellent pushing abilities, only matched by Karthus and Anivia. However, as game changed, it evolved into a more mobile playstyle, where most 'viable' champions had some sort of gap closer or manouverability skill. This, paired with the lack of escape and an ultimate that stuns Malzahar in place, made him obsolete. 





&gt;Let's take a look at his information



**Base Health:** 380 -&gt; *89th highest*

**Health per level:**  80 -&gt; *81st highest*

**Health Regeneration:** 4.5 -&gt; *86th highest*

**Health Regeneration per level:** 0.55 -&gt; *66th highest*

**Mana:** 250 -&gt; *20th highest*

**Mana per level:** 45 -&gt; *31st highest*

**Mana Regeneration:** 7 -&gt; *11st highest*

**Mana Regeneration per level:** 0.6 -&gt; *29th highest*

**Range:** 550 -&gt; *9th highest*

**Attack Damage:** 51.7 -&gt; *59th highest*

**Attack Damage per level:** 3 -&gt; *97th highest*

**Armor:** 15 -&gt; *45th highest*

**Armor per Level:** 3.5 -&gt; *37th highest*

**Magic Resist:** 30 -&gt; *Same as everybody, no scaling*

**Movement Speed:** 340 -&gt; *41st highest*




&gt;**Abilities:**

***Q: Call of the Void***

- AoE line nuke with 400 width
- Magic Damage
- Base damage: 80 / 135 / 190 / 245 / 300
- Ratio: 0.8 AP
- Silence everyone it hits for 1.4 / 1.8 / 2.2 / 2.6 / 3 seconds


*Great poking tool, great wave-clearing ability, devastating if landed on multiple people in a teamfight*




***W: Null Zone***

- AoE circle DoT with 500 diameter
- Duration: 5 seconds
- Base damage per second: 4% / 5% / 6% / 7% / 8% of maximum health
- Damage per second ratio: +1% for each 100 Ability Power
- Maximum base damage:  20% / 25% / 30% / 35% / 40% of maximum health
- Maximum damage ratio: +5% per each 100 Abiliy power


*Low early game damage, huge late game damage, tiny radius*




***E: Malefic Visions***

- Targeted DoT spell
- Duration: 4 seconds
- Base damage: 80 / 140 / 200 / 260 / 320
- Ratio: +0.8 of Ability Power
- When a unit dies while affected by this spell, it will jump to a nearby unit, and restore mana to Malzahar
Mana Restored: 10 / 14 / 18 / 22 / 26

*Amazing farming and pushing ability, while being a good mana sustain spell early and mid game. High damage early and mid-game*



***R: Nether Grasp***

- Targeted channeled ability
- Suppresses the target
- Duration: 2.5 seconds
- Base damage per second: 100 / 160 / 220 
- Damage per second ratio: +0.52 of Ability Power
- Maximum base damage:  250 / 400 / 550 
- Maximum damage ratio: 1.3 of Ability Power


*Great dueling ability. High damage, stuns target in place, however it stuns Malzahar as well for the duration.*



&gt;**Win ratio and popularity:**

Popularity: 3.02%

Win ratio: 49.72%

Ban ratio: 0.08%


&gt;**Recent competitive apparitions:**

Very rare. 

MoMa used him while he was in aAa in a game vs SK.

Former CJ-Entus Dade used him in a cheese Soraka+Malzahar mid uber aggressive pushing strat.


&gt;**Pros:**

- Great pushing power
- Lane dominant
- Great duelist
- Reasonable sustain
- Good ganker
- High damage output

&gt;**Cons:**

- Very vulnerable to early ganks
- Falls of late game
- Requires very careful positioning
- Can't peel for himself
- No escape mechanism
- Roots himself during his ultimate
- Quicksilver Sash counters his combo

After this introduction to who is Malzahar, let's get to some questions worth of discussion:

- In the current meta-game of HP stacking, how could Malzahar fare? How could he be improved in order to do good?
- Is QSS really a problem? In my opinion, making the enemy team spend around 5k gold just to counter Malzahar is a good thing.
- Are Malzahar's base stats up-to-date with current FotM AP casters?
- Are the new items such as Liandry's really boosting Malzahar's performance?
- What changes to Malzahar's numbers and kit would make him viable, without changing the feel of the champion?
- Scarra once said that Malzahar's cast animations were  too long and really holding him back. How come?


Feel free to discuss this thread about one of my favourite champions. Cheers!

My name’s Will “Chobra” Cho, and I’m the Creative Director and Assistant Business Manager on the Global Team from Ongamenet, the organizer and broadcaster of LoL Champions from Korea. As we gear up for the Spring Season of League of Legends Champions and upcoming SC2 content (and wait for our HD renovations in the stadium/studio!), we wanted to take this chance to answer some of your questions and spend some time with you! (If you want some more basic info on myself/OGN, read below!)


**Please submit questions here, and I will answer them live on stream from the office on March 6th, Wednesday, 10 PM EST / 7PM PST  for about 2-3 hours, including gameplay on the Korean server!** (A separate European timezone broadcast is in consideration)

**Time is subject to change**


We welcome all questions from feedback on Champions Winter, Features/Content you’d like to see, questions about how things work at OGN, and even our favorite foods! It is an AMA after all (but not a We Will Answer Everything ;P ) You can also direct questions specifically to myself, or any position in the office (such as the directors of the tournaments or various shows etc.)


---


**Depending on the # of questions, of course I won’t be able to get through everything. Here’s how it will work:**

If we can have one broadcast each for EU and NA, then I will prioritize any such region based questions first on stream.
If only one broadcast, I will prioritize questions that are deemed more overarching i.e. ones that a broader audience shares interest in.


Any questions unanswered I will revisit and write down for everyone in another post or google doc or such

The last legitimate tournament on a world scale was IPL5, and I thoroughly enjoyed watching the talents each region brought to the table. 

Remember how WE won the entire tournament? I find the lack of discussion about how the China scene is slowly becoming a dominant force, I personally can even argue that it is the strongest scene at the moment. 

With LCS going on, I know it is difficult to follow any other scene, but watching how Team WE and TPA execute their plans is inspiring, I can guarantee many jaw-dropping plays from any of the vods with these teams involved.

1373506389.0,14,self.summoners,1i1tr1,Exploring Asian Episode 2: Chinese LPL Summer Season Returns on 12th July,14,0,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1i1tr1/exploring_asian_episode_2_chinese_lpl_summer/,"Been a really long long break from posting on reddit due to personal reason, now come back right before the Chinese LPL summer season starts. 

The Summer Season of LPL remain as 8 teams playing ONLY 3 Circle of BO1s, instead of 4 like in the Spring. This cut-short is because the lack of time for the qualifier to S3 World Final hence cutting 2 weeks away could help the situation out by a lot. 

During the Spring season and playoff, 2 less-known teams really stepped their game up and start to take over the old dominated forces of WE/IG in China lol scene. 

One Team that has been dominating the whole China lol scene, is the Dark Force, **team OMG**. OMG jump into the scene as one of the team that has great potential, and they really take on the chance to shine in playing LPL. Not only had dominating result against IG ( 7 2 since lpl start, in all official competitions), but been winning every competition lately. They have Clowned as champion in 3 straight tournaments in China in less than a month, started from the great showing in LPL playoff, beat WE and PE in progress; also champion of WVW cup and starswar 8. They are now the team to beat in China as none of the top teams able to adapt well to their style of play which is as fast as the korean but even more teamfight-centralized. 

OMG would look to continue its domination and since they already got the ticket to the qualifier ( top 2 in Spring regular season), they may start to bring out more different way of playing to test which are the good ways to pick up in future. Their recent role swap between Lovelin (now jungle) and Bigpomelo (now support) already brought them 3 titles and they would look to open the gap further between themselves and rest of the chinese teams. 

Another team should be look at is Positive Energy, which formerly known as WE b team. Currently the team has further divided them away from the WE organization by register their new team name as **China.PE**. 

China.PE is sponsor by a famous chinese gaming organization: 'china' which is equally influential as another powerhouse 'royal' (sponsor of Royal.HZ). This new sponsorship enable PE to improve their financial power and Independence, allow them to separate themselves from the old image of WE.B team and work on better performance or even potential improvement if any roster change should be made. 

PE has been doing really well in past 1 month. Not only step up their games to be on bar of WE/IG but also reach some results that has never expected by fans before, like Runner up in both LPL Playoff and WVW cup, beating IG in both Semis. Their improvement has went on step by step. At first it was the arrival of Jing in the jungle during the spring season of LPL. Jing as a hyper-aggresive jungler bring the PE team to the right direction as they really enjoy playing aggresive as whole. Later then the adc Namei, former known as PE.Devil, also reach his peak performance as able to dominate every single bot lane opponent in China. Lately, the often pointed as the weak link of PE, top laner Aluka, also step up his game by alot as Kennen being one of his best champion. Add together mid laner Jojo and support + Captain Sicca which both been good players, PE looks highly possible to bring out some real challenge to the 2 tickets for China at the S3 World final. 



The Old Boys, IG, WE and Royal.Hz, are all looking to return to their best as soon as possible. **World Elite** in particular, has really disappointed millions of their local fans in China in performance recently. Their passive style often criticized by viewers as not matching the meta well. And only 1 title in every competition since lost to IG in SWL2 can not match the former image of the unbeatable team of the world. WE's problem could be internal + external but one of the most seriously problem now is the moral factor of the team is in all-time lowest level since Clearlove and Fzzf join the team before S2 final Last year. 

WE has problem in adapting to the new meta and get hit on moral by all the unsatisfied results. **Invictus Gaming** on another hand, looks lack of discipline and organizes since the end of LPL regular season, or say, after all-stars. The lost to Korea in AS brought a lot of analyses and different views to the Chinese LoL scene, many teams try to adapt to the Korean style of playing with faster pace and picking up broken champions fitting the pace. But all of these changes did not go too well for IG as they struggled a lot between changing and remaining.  But IG do have enough individual talents in the team which is a really good part of their problem, as long as they are able to pick up what they really want to play, the old fearful IG team will be back to the scene in no time. (But again, moral factor is a big part to the IG team here). 

Another team that could make some challenge to the S3 ticket is **Royal.HZ**. The recent return of Tabe at the support role already show some small improvement of the team as they are able to bring more to the table rather than the old everything-about-UZI. With Uzi continue to be strong, and Godlike at the top able to hold his lane well, Royal could surprise people by bring many odd strategies which other teams in China might not use at all. 

Another team that remain from the Spring season was the 6th place team LM, which now **LMQ.TC**(tianci). They have a big roster swap as only the ADC and Top remain in their old roles. LM.Wayoff, famous by his insane Shaco play against WE in the spring, now switch to the Mid Lane. 2 Players from Royal.TC (ex-royal b team) has mix up with the team under the sponsorship and team-reform. Dreams, playing as jungle and PandaB at support, would have to wait and see if they can bring the LMQ.TC to another level or remain as the team fight for avoiding relegation. 

2 new teams in the Summer Season are EP.HK, and YG. **Energy Pacemaker.HK**, formerly known as Hongkong Carries, drop out from the S3 qualifier of Taiwan/Hongkong/Macau region to participant in the LPL. They believe playing in LPL would improve their team far more than remain in the qualifier and get destroy by the taiwanese teams. Their No.1 mission of the season is to avoid seating at the last spot of LPL. 

Another team in the LPL summer is YG, **Young Glory**, former IG.Y (b team). This team has one of the youngest roster in LPL and they will bring to the league some refreshing air. As chinese often say the New-born bulls would not fear the Tigers, This team is expect to bring out many New thing to the table and try to win some game and avoid relegation.

1372086579.0,12,self.summoners,1gz00a,ADC vs Bruiser - which class is healthier for the game?,19,7,54,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1gz00a/adc_vs_bruiser_which_class_is_healthier_for_the/,"http://na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=3551106

After seeing [this](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=3551106) thread on the front page of the main subreddit, it got me thinking. A lot of the nerfs/balance changes to bruiser items made ADC stronger. ADC/support lanes have been the meta since late Season One, and it hasn't really shifted at all since then. Despite lane swaps and faster turret killing, the core meta (what roles are selected) has not changed since S1 Worlds. Is ADC truly the menace responsible for stagnating LoL? Were bruisers truly too strong for ADCs to handle?

---

Personally, I think bruisers were well-positioned before the nerfs to phage. I think the original S3 Black Cleaver made bruisers appear to be a lot stronger in S3 than they really were. Post-nerfs, bruisers fell in line. I miss building phage, but the item is incredibly inefficient compared to in S2 when it was significantly cheaper. This nerf really hurt heroes like Darius, Irelia, Olaf, etc. In fact, throughout S3, bruiser items have been repeatedly nerfed, and anti-bruiser items (BotRK) have been buffed/changed. These changes really nurse ADCs.

Additionally, after checking LoLKing's stats, there are only 3 ADCs with winrates under 49% - Ezreal (47.4%) [note that SotEL was just nerfed again this patch], Urgot (46.0%) [does he even count anymore?], and Corki (44.7%). Draven has the second highest winrate of all heroes (54.5%). Twitch is the only other ADC with a winrate above 51%, and he's not too far above it (52.7%). Every other ADC, on average, wins 49% or more games they are in. **Generally, ADC winrates fall into an average between 49 and 51 percent.** This is likely due to the fact that there are usually 2 ADCs in every game.

The fact that the values are averaging out could also be an indicator that **ADCs bring the same chance of victory to the team**. These heroes have incredibly consistent win-rates in solo queue. In an arranged game, where communication and team-fighting takes place on a whole different scale, barring huge mistakes (i.e. priority targets getting caught out of position), the team whose ADC does more DPS is more likely win the team-fight. High-level players can focus their abilities on protecting their ADC or blitzing the enemy's ADC/APC, depending on which would be more beneficial. This tends to happen towards the end-stages of the game. **The end-game of almost every game revolves around the ADC.** There's obviously going to be exceptions - there are APCs and Bruisers who have amazing late-games - but in a relatively typical scenario, teams are relying mainly on their ADCs for the bulk of their damage after 30 minutes. 

I feel like the biggest issue at the moment is that anti-ADC items are not strong enough anymore. If a team wanted to opt for a meta-change and run dual bruiser versus support/ADC, they would absolutely have to CRUSH the enemy before they reached that 30ish minute mark in the game, **where the enemy ADC outscales the bruiser in team-fights simply by being there**. This hinders new strategies and new metagame developments because their chance of success is so reliant on proper execution within a very small window of opportunity.

I used to run Pantheon/Taric cheese botlane, and the results were varied, but they boiled down to 2 things: Can I, as a bruiser, completely nullify the enemy ADC (either through denying farm or through assassinating them quickly in a fight)? If not, can I output a comparable amount of damage over the same amount of time without putting myself in harm's way? A lot of the time, I was winning my games by forcing all-ins at level 3/4 and killing either of my lane opponents. I would snowball so hard that the enemy ADC would lose farm and the enemy jungler would waste time coming bottom. However, if I did not succeed in shutting down the enemy before they base  (with anywhere between 1k and 2k gold), the enemy ADC would have a huge advantage simply because their auto attacks come off cooldown faster than Pantheon's Q does. Their damage starts to outscale bruiser damage because of their range. Outplaying and coming out ahead in exchanges becomes incredibly difficult once item scaling kicks in.

**tl;dr** my opinions on bruisers and ADCs

Unlike NA, many teams that did not qualify in Spring stuck together and 4 are back for another shot at the LCS.

Also Alternate is favored to take on GIANTS! Alternate lost to GIANTS in the spring and it kept them out of the bracket stage.

NA LCS Promotion can get confusing.  Doublebuff (1 Trick Ponies) Team Astral Poke (Nydus is Diamond 1) The Salad Bar (Hedgehog Brigade) and Fidelis (No Team Name Necesarry) are all not competing under the name they qualified under.

I think these are the 2 biggest stories out of NA:

Complexity has been on the rise with Pr0lly, but now have lost Bruch U.  Will they be able to hold on against (likely) Quantic, the top seeded Challenger. 

CLG, Cats, and Doublebuff.  Although many people want to see Jiji take on his old team, they'll first have to fight through Doublebuff. Doublebuff has been largely ignored but they are the higher seed in this matchup. [This blog](http://midorafk.wordpress.com/2013/04/27/why-doublebuff-1-trick-ponies-shouldnt-be-ignored/) boast about Doublebuff and their impressive scrim record.

I've now got this to the full prototype/pre-release stage... and now it's available for people to try out! 

Please let me know what you think, and any issues you have. There are some known issues, but I haven't collated them into one place yet. 

Here's the link: http://beta.zaprocalypse.com/rolepick/prototype/

**What does it do?**

The app is designed to help you organise the roles for a team, by putting as many people in the roles they prefer as possible. Each player gives information about what roles they prefer - and the application will return the team that gives the strongest team given that information.

To do this, it assigns a point value for each role for each player, and then runs through all ther possible variations for the top scoring combination.

*Example result:*  http://i.imgur.com/dYpcXVo.png

The app is designed to take information directly via a copypaste from pregame / champselect chat, and to provide you text to put back into chat. 

At the moment, the prototype only works with a specific input, due to my pretty basic parsing. In the future, it should allow for a few more forms of data. 

**Future Plans**

*     More accepted names for roles
*     Better error checking / failure to parse messages
*     Optimistic or Pessimistic options for unspecified roles. This makes a surprising amount of difference.
*     Dealing with ties more effectively (surprisingly rare if most information is completed)
*     Sorting of team variations by score
*    Ability to input information via a form (dropdown boxes, etc.) - this would make the app better for users planning well before a match.

Atmas either needs the passive buffed or the crit removed for some other stat (damage or attack speed most likely), personally i'm in favor of the latter.

Youmuus I have no idea on, something needs to be changed though.

Executioners is just a mess, personally I think it either needs much more crit or the large amount of lifesteal added back into it.

APs really took over the midlane in Season 2, but that seemed to end when Froggen reminded us that a good Lee Sin could dump on any lane in the game. Then Black Cleaver was remade and AD champions were seemingly mid to stay. And, even beyond the AD champs, there are AP champions like Vlad, Rumble, Katarina, Diana, etc. that are all somewhat viable in both mid and top.

Given that champ select can make or break a game, especially in organized play, how beneficial would it be for, say, and LCS team to have a decent amount of overlap with their top's and mid's champion pool?

The first pro that comes to mind is that it's hard to counter lanes, obviously. If somebody picks KZ, and you plan on playing two 1v1 lanes, you're sort of forced to pick a ""safe"" champion, because in the process of countering KZ, you can easily be countered by the team swapping which lane he plays.

I can think of two cons. The first is that a ban can be doubly effective. Targeted bans could, theoretically, lock out two people instead of one. That's a big con. The second is that a few of the overlap champs are more vulnerable in 2v1 lanes than more specialized champs. 

Now, some of you might be thinking, ""Why not just have player be able to play both lanes? Isn't that the same thing, but safer?""

Well, while you'd effectively have a much larger champion pool if that was the case, I'd argue that matchups are *much* harder to learn than champions. Learning how to play a champion is relatively easy. But learning how your kit interacts with opposing champions in the environment of different lanes is incredibly complex. If a team were to approach training like that, they'd be more difficult to ban out, but I think they'd end up losing a lot of lanes to more focused players. 

Anyway, I just wonder what some of you think about how effective it would be for teams to focus on having more overlap between players in their champion pools. This could also apply to supports and mid laners, but top and mid was what got my thought balls descending. 

EDIT: Another pro that just crossed my mind is regarding first-pick-worthy champions. Not many highly flexible champs are first-pick-worthy, but I think there are a few. The problem is that a player might be worried about getting countered. Being able to move that champion to a different role and effectively get a second pick at the other role gives you a lot more breathing room in champ select.",,False,,t5_2wenn,1365457681.0,,crs,True,t3_1bwlkg,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1bwlkg/how_strong_is_champion_pool_overlap_between_top/,

1362160299.0,14,self.summoners,19h202,Viability of Ashe,20,6,56,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/19h202/viability_of_ashe/,"Ashe was one of my top-played champions prior to S3 and even then people bashed her for being unviable as an ADC. Some of the arguments I've seen include:
 - ""She has no escape!""
 - ""Most of her skills have effects given by items!""

Both of those arguments are true, but that doesn't make her useless. 

By not having an escape, she's prone to gap-closing bruisers, but it can be resolved by simply not standing in the middle of the fight. By properly kiting the enemy in combination with Frost Shot, Ashe can easily forego a 10s cooldown escape for another useful skill to synergize with her kit.

Although Ashe's kit contains skills that have item counterparts, by having them as skills instead of items, she is able to focus completely on rushing important high-gold cost items such as Infinity Edge or Guardian Angel. By having Frost Shot in combination with the occasional Volley for AOE damage/effect, she saves herself 3250g. She is now 550g away from a massive damage boost while Ezreal is still building Sheen after building Bloodthrister.

Ashe's Eagle, something people cast off as a weak temporary ward, is invaluable in chasing, Ashe's specialty. In combination with Frost Shot and the massive damage boost from your early IE, Ezreal can either fight back (and die) or attempt to escape (and die).

And if by chance that pesky ezreal Arcane Shifted outside your auto-attack range and Volley and cleansed your slow, Ashe also has a powerful stun that completely imobilizes the escapee.

And now with patch 3.0.3, Ashe is even more viable with a higher attack speed scaling and the buff to Blade of the Ruined King. Even if she doesn't rush IE, her base attack speed combined with the massive buff from Blade of the Ruined King will completely shred any persistent Xin Zhao or Maokai coming to gank.

Blaze went with the pair of Cpt Jack and Muse for the series which arguably was a decision that went in their favor. Jack Sparrow, as MakNoon would say, had some flashes of brilliance skirting around teamfights while on Vayne, but still managed to get himself caught out a few times. Muse was solid throughout the games including some solid Crescendos and seemed to be overall, more effective than Lustboy has been.  

Blaze made some questionable decisions in picks and bans in almost every game, most notably letting Kakao get Elise and of course as MC said, picking such slow scaling champions in the 5th game. I also didn't think that Ryu's Ahri was so terrifying that it warranted a ban the rest of the series. That ban could have been used on Zac perhaps.

How will this affect the current NA LCS teams and their meta accordingly?

**Stats**

6/9 games played yesterday had him, significantly higher statistics than we have seen throughout the LCS.

Bitfatlp (Mid) and Grim Samurai (Top) have a 100% pick and win rate with him so far.

He has won 4/6 games, with losses on Velocity E-Sports (Vileroze) and Team Astral Poke (Anxietylol).

**Rank 1: Team OMG / 1st / 18W5L**

If you are wondering which team could be the most on Form team atm around the world, it has to be team OMG. The lpl leader is having a 18 straight win on going in all official competitions, they have beaten every single team in the lpl at least once so far. Also they just beat team LM last night in the GES qualifier 2 0 with conceding just 1 tower in 2 games and each less than 25 minutes. They will face team WE in 16 hours time in the lpl week 9 day 1 action. 

**Rank. 2: Invitus Gaming / 2nd / 18W5L**

IG is still tied on win/lose record with omg in lpl but the result between these 2 teams is 0 5 in favor of omg in both lpl and ges qualifier. IG has been very stable in lpl, kept up the pace with omg as much as possible. Their individual performance had shifted a little bit as xiaoxiao and illusion stepped up their games recently but Zz1tai and pdd had some less impressed game. The decisive match against team omg in week 10 could decide the final standing of lpl. IG had lost their qualifier to PE in the GES so Fans won't see them next week in the LAN final.

**Rank. 3: Team WE / 3rd / 16W7L**

The long lasted leader of the Chinese lol scene is having some spiky period in their games past few weeks. They could do really well against IG and PE, can win ugly against Spider and royal, can lose to woa and lm. Some of their fans have been criticized as unreasonably annoying lately as the former unbeaten Titan return to earth. They still have a most talented team in China and it is only takes time for they the recover. 

**Rank. 4: Positive Energy and Royal.HZ / 4th and 5th / 14W9L and 11W12L**

PE and Royal has done quite similarly in recent weeks. PE continue to be able to secure wins against weaker teams in lpl and also beat IG in GES qualifier and Royal had done quite good against OMG and WE. Royal maybe less impressed in lpl but they beat PE in GES qualifier a day before yesterday to reach the LAN final equal up the performance from both team in past 15 days. 

**Rank. 6: Team LM / 6th / 8W15L**

Team LM could be most impressed team lately from the lpl. Although there is no Chance for them to reach the playoff as top 4, but their spot at summer season as top 6 finish is quite secure atm. Fans are encouraged that giving more time team LM would surely become another strong force in China. 

**Rank.7: Wings of Aurora / 7th / 5W18L**

WOA is another team from the bottom 3 finally step up their games lately. Their latest role switch, putting former support and Captain Haokai to mid Lane had improve their overall performance largely and now they even have a chance to fight for a guaranteed summer spot as they will do best to catch up team LM. 

**Rank.8: Wayi.Spider / 8th / 2W21L**

Spider from a highly regarded team to the 1st team to relegate to the tga promotion series only took 2 month. The unstable medical condition of their key member and lack of experience in some of the other players could be a key reason behind their fall. They will have a very very hard time in the tga promotion series with at least 6 to 8 teams are expected to be better than them.

*Top 5 Players in last 2 weeks*

1. OMGogoing

2. OMGcool

3. LiveMoreWayoff

4. PE.NameI (devil)

5. WOA.Haokai


**Regarding GES competition LAN final**

Will be play in Shanghai on the 18th and 19th of May. The 4 participants are Team WE, TPA, Royal.HZ And Team OMG. 

**Regarding LPL playoff**

Which is also this year's TGA summer tournament. Top 4 ranking in the spring season will enter. First place vs forth, second against third.

The positions looks pretty set already in the EU allstars team. The top contenders for the mid lane are pretty close to eachother and may shuffle around, and maybe also AD carry. But support, top and jungle needs an overwhelming amount of votes to change.

So what do you all think of the current team consisting of Diamondprox, Wickd, EDward, Yellowpete and maybe xPeke. Is it the best that EU has to offer? The rumoured language barriers looks to not be of too much trouble with Diamondprox knowing both english and russian and being able to translate for EDward, but the bot lane synergy will be worse.",,False,,t5_2wenn,False,,mrn,True,t3_1bnc9i,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1bnc9i/eu_allstars_m5egfnatic/,

1373188678.0,11,self.summoners,1hsniy,What are the top tier 2v1 / 1v2 champions?,15,4,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1hsniy/what_are_the_top_tier_2v1_1v2_champions/,"With the rise of the 2v1 lane matchups in all lanes I would like to start a discussion on the champions best suited for this role. Since in the current DoTA meta laners going solo vs usually multiple opponents in the long lane are called *suicide laners*, I borrowed the term. Some questions to consider:

* What are the most desirable qualities these champions should have?
* Which champions are currently picked in the competitive scene and why? Provide VoDs if possible.
* Are there any champions that in your opinion fit the bill of being good 1v2 perfectly but aren't used? Why do you think so?

As for my opinion to start off the discussion... I believe the most important qualities of a 1v2 laner are:

* **ability to farm from range/quickly waveclear** - probably the most important thing, allows the suicide laner to help his tower stay up and be farmed.
* **ability to deter tower dives** - whether it is by being tanky, elusive or having strong CC / a vision ability, a suicide laner needs something to prevent the enemy jungler from coming from behind the tower and picking up free kill.
* **ability to stay relevant even with inferior farm** - regardless of his waveclear abilities, it is inevitable for the suicide laner to be denied farm/exp in most of the games. Therefore it is important for him to function well in a low farm environment.

As for the list of champions that fit that role, I'd like to start with IMHO a god-tier suicide laner:

* **Elise** - Often used by MYM Kubon ([example game 1](http://www.twitch.tv/dreamhacklol/b/417659901?t=3h48m13s), [example game 2](http://www.twitch.tv/dreamhacklol/b/417659901?t=10h28m45s)). Her CC and elusiveness makes her hard to dive, while her ranged AA and explosive spiderlings allow her to waveclear/farm decently. Can function well with just magic penetration items, which are very cheap. Combination of her mobility/CC/high damage makes it a good lane for Elise's jungler to gank for despite no numbers advantage - [Example 1](http://www.twitch.tv/dreamhacklol/b/417659901?t=3h54m30s), [Example 2](http://www.twitch.tv/dreamhacklol/b/417659901?t=10h35m00s). Very flexible in both her build / teamfight role, can fulfill the roles of tank/splitpusher/assassin/initiator - she is decent at all of these roles, but excels at none.

This is it from me for now, however there are a few more picks that are IMHO worth looking into: Diana, Jayce, Kennen, Nasus, Olaf, Renekton, Shen, Udyr, Urgot, Zac.

Hello again boys and girls, week 3 is over and my latest results are in.


| Rank| Team | Elo Rating | Change| Win-Loss |
|:---:|:-----:|:---------:|:-------------:|:-----:|
|1|C9|1283|+8|8-2|
|2|CLG|1241|+17|6-4|
|3|VUL|1236|+23|6-4|
|4|DIG|1198|+16|5-5|
|5|CST|1195|-21|5-5|
|6|CRS|1180|+22|4-6|
|7|TSM|1156|-56|4-6|
|8|VES|1110|-10|2-8|  

C9 briefly broke the 1300 barrier after their win over CLG but their loss to Vulcun sent them back down to where they've been for the past two weeks.  This weeks big mover is TSM, going 0-3 and plummeting to 7th place in the standings.

In addition, League is a lot more complicated than can be expressed by a single number like elo; this is just one way of looking at things and one we're all familiar with from solo queue (well, season 2 solo queue anyway).

**Week 4 Match Win Probabilities**

|Blue Team|Est. Win%||Est. Win%|Red Team|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|CRS|42%|vs|**58%**|VUL|
|VES|46%|vs|**54%**|TSM|
|C9|**62%**|vs|38%|DIG|
|CLG|**57%**|vs|43%|CST|
|CRS|36%|vs|**64%**|C9|
|TSM|44%|vs|**56%**|CST|
|VES|32%|vs|**68%**|CLG|
|DIG|45%|vs|**55%**|VUL|

So CLG vs Velocity is the biggest mismatch we've had so far, with CLG a massive 131 points higher than their opponent.  Surprisingly, Velocity is also involved in the closest matchup of the week in their game against TSM.  I don't think there's a better way to illustrate how bad a week TSM had in Anaheim.

**NA and EU ratings for last season!**

This project has been a lot of fun for me, and it seems to have inspired many others as well.  Many of you have expressed interest in seeing the results of running these calculations over the spring split.  Because I'm doing these calculations by hand I was rather reluctant to take on the project, but several users with some coding skills messaged me over the past week with results of programs they ran to calculate ratings for last split!  Special thanks to /u/xkeemy and /u/hehewaffles for sending me your work and helping /u/Forcepath and I to find an error in the results I had mentioned in the comments of last week's post.

/u/hehewaffles has generously posted his results on his website [here](http://lcs.damondoucet.net/).  There you can see how each team was rated after each of the spring split's 10 weeks for both NA and EU, so head on over there if you are interested in seeing how the ratings changed over the course of the season.  I will post  the final spring ratings of the NA teams here for those who are interested.  Note that the final super week had a huge effect on the final standings.

**Spring Split Final Ratings**

| Rank| Team | Elo Rating | Change| Win-Loss |
|:---:|:-----:|:---------:|:-------------:|:-----:|
|1|TSM|1356|+52|21-7|
|2|CRS|1233|-86|19-9|
|3|DIG|1208|-61|17-11|
|4|VUL|1190|+67|12-16|
|5|GGU|1187|-10|11-17|
|6|CLG|1158|-14|13-15|
|7|COL|1134|+45|9-19|
|8|MRN|1133|+8|10-18|

**Some Quick Math Notes**

* I did indeed start everyone at 1200 elo.
* I am using a k of 36, slightly on the high side, so that ratings have a chance to diverge over the short season.
* I am willing to consider decreasing k mid way through the season once scores have had a chance to settle a bit, but am strongly leaning against doing so at the moment.
* Win probability estimates are calculated using the following formula: 1/(1+10^((rating of B - rating of A)^)/400 )",,False,,t5_2wenn,False,,dignitas,True,t3_1hfzri,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1hfzri/na_lcs_week_3_unofficial_elo_ratings_xpost/,

1364723018.0,11,self.summoners,1bcoes,"[Discussion] Another Karma post. Thoughts about matchups in bot lane. (Warning, wall of text. But don't worry, you can still pick out my main ideas easily.)",19,8,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1bcoes/discussion_another_karma_post_thoughts_about/,"I just finished a game laning bot with a Karma as AP Ezreal. The summoner was brand new to the champ, but had owned her before the rework was ~~announced~~ leaked. Same story for me. Now this was a bot game because I was just looking to get my first win quick, so we definitely didn't tap fully into what potential we found. However, even though it was bots we got to see a bit of what she can do. (Credit to NamelessHero2222 for the awesome game!) These are my thoughts on our discoveries.

####Karma.
Lets start with a little explanation of Karma. Her role as a burst champion has stayed, but she can trade much better now and has more utility. Her ult has a short cooldown and the timer is reduced when she does damage to champions (1 second for abilities, 1/2 for AA's). How about her combos? Her w can set up a lot of damage if you get the root. Place a mantra'd q on them and watch as they try and run from their inevitable damage/demise. Unless you're Fizz, in which case fuck you. Phreak mentioned this combo in the spotlight and I think it could become her bread-and-butter. Another good combo is with melee champions if you get a slow off and they run in, you can use your shield to AOE burst effectively. When running, place your w on melee champions like Yi. If you root a ranged champ or mage they can still get damage off. We didn't get a chance to much else, so if you've found anything good leave a comment!

####AP Ezreal.
I have to explain AP Ez before continuing. I've been playing him a fair amount recently, but I want to explain my knowledge so you have more backstory or in case you haven't ever seen/played AP Ez before. AP Ezreal is played in the back, far from all danger. You play him with instant reflexes and a lot of good positioning. This is the reason I think he synergized with Karma so well, as she could give me easy skillshots with her slow and a guaranteed ult with her root. (On a related note, I always play AP ez when I lane with a Sona. Extra mana, high burst/poke, and a perfect ult wombo combo.)

###Karma's matchups.
I'm looking at Karma with the specific recent experience of AP Ezreal, but there are a number of ADC's that have more bursty/skillshot mechanics or seem to also fit for other reasons. ADC's that have burst potential are Corki, Graves, and AD Ezreal. I'll also mention Draven, Caitlyn, Varus, and Vayne, as well as Quinn for later. Karma can provide the moment those characters need in order to get off their damage and amplifies the moment with her own burst. These are the champions I think that could synergize well with Karma. Now, for the ""burst"" matchups. Karma is a burst champion. That's what they made her into. I think the best champions to compare Karma to would be a Lux/Morgana support. You can loosely think about Karma in a similar way as I talk about some specific champions and their potential. I'll number each combo at the from [1] (bad combination) to [5] (perfect match). No 1's for this section.

- Corki: *no personal experience* [2-3] - Corki's missiles would be a breeze with Karma's cc. Also good double q burst. No sustain for Corki's mana hunger. Potentially good combo.
- Graves: *little personal experience* [4] - Good burst combo. Shield damage fits well with Grave's up close and personal damage style. Consider more E levels. Good combo.
- Ezreal: *some personal expereince* [3] - Similar to AP Ezreal play, Karma sets up q hits &amp; ultimate well and can keep the squishy Ezreal safe with e shield and speed. Potentially good combo.
- Draven: *little personal experience* [3-4] - Good setups for Draven's high damage with her slow, but being a skillshot makes it slightly unreliable. Shield would be slightly under-used. Early game potential would be absolutely massive. Level 1 or 2 all in would be devastating. Potential for early game snowballing, good combo, **requires more thought.**
- Caitlyn: *little personal experience* [2-3] - With Caitlyn's long range, you lose some of Karma's potential from her shield. Main plus comes from Caitlyn being able to send a guaranteed q with Karma's root, similar to Ezreal. Also, don't quote me on this, but if Karma's q gives vision, you could catch an enemy with Cait's ult as they run. I haven't tested this, though. Limited combo potential. Fair combo.
- Varus: *little personal experience* [3-4] - Burst potential with Varus' E (and Q). Good kiting with speed buff for blight stacks. Karma's root would make Varus' ultimate highly reliable and effective. Fairly good combo.
- Vayne: *some personal experience* - [4] Both share an aggressive playstyle. Similar pros as Graves. I can't find the range of her Mantra'd E effect. If it's at least 525, it's a perfect combination. If it's less, it makes for a more risky play. Highly skill based, potentially very good combo.
- **Quinn**: *little personal experience* ~~[5]~~[3] - Mechanically, Quinn and Karma could produce a very deadly lane. Both Karma and Quinn want quick engagements and Karma compliments Quinn's dive-in style of gameplay. Unfortunately, Quinn doesn't really seem to be up-to-par on her numbers to really create a competitive lane. The potential seems to be there, but Quinn probably needs some buffs or QOL changes to be effective. Nonetheless, I think it would be a fun lane to try out. Potentially good combo, restricted by Quinn's numbers.
~~Lots of theorycrafting here, as Quinn hasn't been around long enough to get pinned down much. However from what I've seen, I think Karma could work very well with Quinn. In fact, I have a specific mechanic in mind that would be utterly unexpected and highly effective. I'm actually really excited about this. I had some really annoying run ins as Quinn with an AI Alistar. When I'd try to Vault onto or next to him, the broken instant computer reflexes would knock me up before I got to him. The reason I mention that is Karma's E. If you can use the shield while Quinn is jumping, I cannot think of any better ranged champion or ability to combine with Karma's shield than Quinn's Vault. Quinn jumps in while Karma send out AOE burst, WHILE protecting any retaliation WHILE helping Quinn escape from the engage speed. It's too perfect. Seriously, I need to try this out. Overall I think Quinn and Karma would have really good trading potential and Quinn benefits from Karma's aggressive playstyle. Karma can set up Quinn's blind skillshot, can(?) pull off abnormal burst with a Vault shield, and HOLY CRAP VALOR. I forgot. Ok, nope. That's it. Perfect combo. No competition. Karma's shield wants a melee champion to best synergize, right? But bot lane is almost always ranged. NOT WITH QUINN. I have to play a game. Now. Jesus, the potential. The all-in you could pull off with Valor supported by Karma would be huge. Karma could help Quinn get out of an engage as Valor with extra speed and block of any pursuers with her root.  The engage should be long enough for Quinn to get the execution off with her ultimate. **Very good combo, needs more exploration**.~~

EDIT: More thoughts on Quinn. It seems like Quinn is considered to be a little underpowered right now. I agree that the concept of Quinn + Karma's quick engage and disengage could be a good combo, but might be b-b-b-broken by Quinn's current numbers.

Quinn EDIT#2: Rewriting of Quinn's section to better reflect how she realistically performs.

EDIT: New lane partner.

- Urgot: *no personal experience* [2-3?] - /u/YUSoTanky mentioned Urgot as a possible lane partner. Karma might be good considering how much Urgot wants to lock down his opponent in a fight, but they have a split when Karma want to burst and Urgot wants to sustain dps. I could us input on this. Possible combo, need more experienced input.

I wish I could to be able to add thoughts about countering and add the rest of the ADC's to my list, but it's really late. If anyone wants to add to my list or comment on what supports Karma counters, and what supports/carries counter Karma, I would love to add your thoughts to my main post.

**tl;dr Thoughts about Karma and information about what she can do. Potential good candidates for duo support. **

I'm really looking forward to feedback from you guys to see how I line up with your thoughts about Karma, but even more to hear ideas I haven't thought of yet!

EDIT2: My general criticism comes from the perception that all of my information is based on bot games. It was a bot game that got me thinking, but **not** where my experience comes from. Compare me to a Reddit lurker. I've been around for a while, but I enjoy watching a good game like the LCS as much as I like playing one. Also please forgive me if I tried to come off as more knowledgeable than I am. I am an AP Carry (Swain ftw!) with a good amount of overall game information. Back to the post, I feel like I need to change the tone of my post to a little less optimistic stance, as I put too much emphasis on Karma's CC. It's not very reliable and not extremely effective. That being said, I think it still has potential and can make plays. Also, my love for the Quinn/Karma matchup is diminished. After some discussion, Quinn's numbers don't really seem to add up to the potential of other ADC's. I knew she wasn't a ""normal"" pick, but hadn't realized that she was considered to be a little UP. As a final note, please keep in mind that I'm only looking for discussion here. I didn't give a perfect list that should be a scientific law when picking Karma as a support. I want to hear what other people think about her rework and hopefully get more information as to how she could fit into the League.

I believe that I have a lot of insight into the game despite not being a pro/challenger/diamond/whatever. I'm content to just talk about League of Legends, but it's hard to find people to talk about it in real-time.

There are just a few posts up to give an idea of the kind of discussion I'm interested in, and the big idea I have for the future of the site would be more liveblogging games alongside the official commentary, and a live chat-room to talk about the games, as I feel that's the weakest part of the live broadcast. (Trying to have a discussion in a twitch chat with 200000 people watching is hard.) Other future plans include pre and post-game discussions of the LCS games.

My Proposal: Create a search filter where a player can put in his information that will search for suitable matches of teams that are looking for a player that fits what you want as well.

Maybe after the basic information is filled out, a player fills out a quick questionnaire getting more specific desires out of what the player wants so a team can better judge if the player fits their needs. An example question is listed below.

How committed are you?

A possible answer could include: ""Im a full time college student but i love league of legends and i loved playing ranked 5s with my real life friends but i would love it even more to find a group of people that have a similar availibility that want to get better at this game and maybe even possibly join a tournament.""

Another answer could be ""I'm actually have a kid but i love the thrill of competing and being in a team atmosphere as i've always played high school sports as i grew up. I would be available for a few hours after my kid goes to be every night to play some games or possibly join a league based tournament system.""

I've been thinking a lot about the community in LoL, and it seems to me that even though things have gotten a lot better recently there seems to be something lacking.  I'm sure you have all seen players that're trolling/feeding/being awful people say things along the lines of ""I won't get banned, Riot never bans people"".  I believe this to be factually false of course, what with the Tribunal and everything doing its job.  

That being said however, I think there's one change (albeit a massive one) that could solve a lot of issues without creating new ones.  Before coming to League I was an avid RuneScape/FunOrb player, and JaGeX had a system implemented in these games called Player Moderators (PMods).  The PMod system did three things:

* It allowed positive members of the community to be recognized both by the company and by the rest of the community as being great people to be around.
* PMods were given the ability (and responsibility) to temporarily mute or temporarily ban other players for particularly egregious behavior.
* PMods could also immediately escalate particularly severe cases directly to JaGeX's Player Support/Community Management team.

The PMods were **volunteers** hand-picked by JaGeX for responsibility and kindness, and were strictly policed by the company.  Player Moderators were positive pillars of the community first, and police second.  If they abused their power they immediately had their PMod status removed and were potentially banned from the game depending on the severity.

The reason I bring all this up is that I feel a system like this could work extremely well for League of Legends.  A lot of the concepts in FunOrb are relatively similar to LoL, although on a larger overall scale.  FunOrb games had a global lobby for each server, whereas LoL obviously only has game lobbies of up to ten people.  Without further ado I'd like to lay out the limitations I want people to consider before raging at me for suggesting this:

* I do NOT think this should be based on Honor.  The Honor system is decently accurate, but it's a bit too easy to falsely acquire Honor or not acquire Honor you deserve.  In my opinion there should be a different metric in place.
* I am suggesting this under the assumption that Riot picks PMods well and makes sure they do not abuse their power.  Please don't fill the comments with ""ehrmagerd but mr t pmods will just mute everyone they dont like"" because SHH!
* This is also under the assumption this system already exists and all of the infrastructure is in place.  I realize this would be difficult to implement, take the suggestions with a grain of salt.
* Last but not least, this is assuming Riot tells/teaches the PMod team how they'd like them to go about their business.

Right, now that's out of the way let's get on to the potential responsibilities of the PMods:

* PMods are required to send a warning to the player in question before taking any action.  This warning would entail either a message in their chat window or some sort of other UI interaction.
* If the player accepts the warning and stops the toxic behavior, no punishment will be administered.  However, the PMod would have the ability to ""blackmark"" that player so that if either the same PMod or a different PMod caught them it'd be clearly obvious that they were a repeat offender.
* If the player does NOT accept the warning, the PMod can apply one (or both) of two punishments.  1) The player is muted for x amount of either real life or in-game time.  2) The player is banned from joining future games for x amount of time.
* In addition, the PMod would be able to escalate players to Player Support.  This escalation would include a recommendation of punishment from the PMod that submitted it based on the severity of the toxicity.  For example, an extremely serious breach of the CoC could be accompanied by a recommendation of a long-term ban.

Now then, there are a few questions I still don't know how to answer myself and I would love some input from you guys.

* Should these PMods have some sort of an identifying marker similar to how the Honor Crests are displayed?
* Would a system like this get in the way of gameplay in any way?  If so how?
* Should the warning be labeled as from the PMod's player name or a global ""Server: Warning"" sort of dealio?

**TL;DR - I am suggesting a Player Moderator system where Riot picks extremely positive players from the community to both be recognized as such and have the ability to keep some of the more egregious cases out of your games.  The goal would roughly be to make PMods a near-instant front line arm of the Tribunal.  THIS IS ALL THEORETICAL!**

Now then, these are the suggestions I've come up with so far.  Please feel free to tell me what's wrong with them or suggest other responsibilities/restrictions!

Thanks for reading,
Eagle

**EDIT:** OK so I'm going to make an edit here I feel is **REALLY** important.  If PMods are not identified as such it'd be extremely easy for average players or trolls to impersonate a PMod and scare the other players into submission.  This would be a HUGE problem in my opinion, but please tell me what you guys/gals think.",,False,,t5_2wenn,1374727278.0,,,True,t3_1ixq7y,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1ixq7y/community_selfgoverning_suggestion/,

As some of you may or may not know, Lulu saw a pretty abysmal Super Week at the NA LCS recently.

Now, I'm not one to jump to conclusions about a champion based on 7 games, but this also coincided with a considerable decline in winrate in Solo Queue. 

Now, I'm not trying to make a thread about whether or not Lulu is weak. I don't think she is, and I don't think anybody with half a brain thinks she is. BUT, during this discussion, the relevance of LoLKing stats came into question.

I think everybody here knows that win, pick, and ban rates can often be given far too much weight in the LoL community. Xypherous has often talked about how ""problem"" champions often hover around 50% (sometimes even under) because they're frequently picked by players who don't know how to play them that well. Alternatively, a middling champion can have a high winrate because the champion is infrequently picked, and when it is picked it is picked by players that play it relatively well. 

Now, while we can agree that these statistics are not the end-all, be-all of champion balance -- that it is simply data -- I think we can also agree that these statistics are hardly irrelevant. Whenever win rates come up, I see a few people who, I assume, are trying to be heroes of reason, saying that solo queue win rates are irrelevant when discussing balance. The most recent reason cited to me is that the ""vast majority of players ... are not playing the game to even 60% of its potential."" 

Disregarding the arbitrary 60% in there, the sentiment behind that comment is true. Most players aren't any where near professional level, and most never will be. Heck, most players will never make it past silver. 

However, what that *does not mean* is that champion statistics from those players are irrelevant. Champions don't exist in a skill-bubble. If a champion is too weak to play in the LCS, you can't just buff it to that strength because it might turn it into a solo queue terror. If a champion is too weak in solo queue, you can't just buff it because it might have negative repercussions regarding the LCS competitive field.

Sorry, this is a bit ranty, but I people in this community like to polarize things -- either something a champion is god tier or its worthless; a statistic is the most important statistic or it is irrelevant; and item is gold efficient or it isn't worth the buy -- and that polarity contributes a lot to the attitudes that stagnate solo queue. When you're having a balance discussion, you're doing yourself a disservice if you ignore data. Instead of ignoring data, we should take more time to decide how the data fits into the tapestry of perspective.

1366736627.0,10,self.summoners,1cy2k6,Concept: Replay reviewing system with some Pro/High Elo volunteers?,11,1,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1cy2k6/concept_replay_reviewing_system_with_some_prohigh/,"What does reddit think of an online replay sharing system that would allow pro players (if they opt'd in) to review user submitted replays, and comment on them with tips on improving? 

This is a followup on this reddit post yesterday: http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1cuqfp/i_feel_like_ive_stopped_getting_better

If the idea went well, could look into expanding it to a full commenting system where players can help other players.  Could probably integrate a ""question/answer"" system like on stackoverflow.  Someone posts a replay, checks a box asking for advice, then the pro players (or high elo volunteers) will be granted special permissions to see a pool of these ""question"" replays. They download it, watch it, and then reply with some commentary on it and ""answer"" it.

Bouncing some concepts around, would like to get some feedback from the community.  This would all launch if supported by a large enough of the community with the new Riot Games Replay system when it comes out into open beta.

**TL;DR** Be able to submit replays onto online system for pro players to be able to review and comment on?

P.S. If you are a high elo player, or a pro player in the LCS/Qualifying for the Summer LCS and are interested in volunteering for this system, pm me.

My previous two posts have analyzed the performances of SK Gaming, Fnatic, EG, and Gambit. Now, to talk about Giants, Wolves, DragonBorns, and aAa - their games today, and how important their games tomorrow are.

**Wolves beat Giants**

This was a huge win for the Wolves, and a dominant one. They were facing another team that had been doing better lately, and stomped them. It was't even close, it was a surrender. Exter was the only player on the Giants with kills at the end of the game. 

On paper it looked fine, except two warning signs: Jarvan, and TF. Svenskeren cannot be allowed to play Jarvan. He's a monster on that champion. And Bjergsen? He's like another xPeke... Just younger, and Danish. Couple that with Thresh's hard CC and Graves's pure damage, and you have one scary team! Not to mention Shen... Whose global threat of just coming out of the blue is so crucial...

Svenskeren became a monster early game, and then Bjergsen took over. Gold card after gold card, Destiny after destiny. Flag toss, Cataclysm, The Box... Wolves pulled out all the stops, and Giants looked lost. They looked shell shocked, as if they didn't know what to do. Babeta had Zyra but it didn't matter. Wolves dominated early, kept it going, and defeated the Giants.

Looking to tomorrow, these teams both have two games. Wolves will look to take down DragonBorns and Gambit. The game against DB should be easy for the Wolves as long as they don't get overconfident. Gambit will be a tough game as always. Worth noting is that Copenhagen is actually 8-4 in their last 12 games. Don't count them out.

Giants face aAa and then SK. aAa looked very strong over DB today, so Giants must watch out that they don't drop another one, because there isn't much time left to get back up if they do get knocked down again. If they can defeat aAa, they might get themselves together to play SK. SK, though, seem to be motivated, so I don't think that they'll win that game.

Expect Wolves over DB but losing to Gambit. Expect Giants to drop both games against aAa and SK. Why? Let me tell you...

**This Dioud is the Real Deal**

Yes, I had to use a pun. After listening to seven hours of puns by the casters, I just couldn't resist. 

It is true that Against All Authority played a very struggling DragonBorns team. However, DB is still a strong team (albeit a struggling one) with capable players in Shushei and HosaN. aAa just looked like a totally different team with Dioud in the lineup. His Janna play was amazing. From using Monsoon to heal against Baron or knock Kha Zix back from diving on his allies to having complete ward coverage for most of the game, aAa finally seems to have found a support player who matches the aggressive nature of Nono. Malunoo tried Udyr in his return to DragonBorns, but it wasn't a great performance. Hosan seems to be the only aggressive one on the team while the rest of the team was caught out over and over again. It did not help that Shlaya's Lux was on key. 

Against All Authority still has a little hope left. If they can defeat Giants, they they can be within reach of striking down the Wolves. Fnatic does await them, though, which will be a very stout test. If aAa, with their new Dioud, can defeat Giants and Fnatic? Then they might actually be able to matter a bit more in the last few weeks of this very turbulent season.

DragonBorns, on the other hand, have no chance of finishing better than .500. As much as I like the play of Shushei and Hosan (Hosan specifically), their season seems lost. It will be up to them to keep motivated and keep hoping. They need to remember that they can still qualify for the Summer Season by winning through the Promotion/Relegation tournament, so it's imperative to try to keep getting better despite the negative results. Facing adversity and persevering is one of the hardest things to do, but it is what they must do.

aAa faces Giants while DB faces Wolves. Then, aAa takes on Fnatic while DB faces EG. I feel bad for the DragonBorns, because if there are two teams who are looking to show that they still matter right now, it's the Wolves and the Evil Geniuses. Wolves are looking for a big win to cement their fifth place standing, while EG wants to forget the taste of defeat they experienced today.

More drama will come. Who will prevail?

**Miscellaneous Notes**

I actually took the time to watch most of the NA LCS matches this week, and it was interesting to see the different play styles. Though not as different as the multitude of play styles in the European scene, it was fun to watch the games. Daydreamin and BloodWater remind me of Edward and nRated in the European scene, while Stvicious and TheOddOne, along with Lautemortis, are very capable junglers. Wildturtle is America's Hosan in a sense, and Voyboy and Dyrus can deal with the best of them.

I still like the EU scene a bit better, but the NA scene is pretty good as well. One thing that stands out, though?

It's nicer, NA, to have a host who's as beautiful, charming, and well-informed as Sjokz. Coupled with her and the analysts having a guest from a team or the Riot community? Nothing beats that. (In my opinion).

I'll write sometime next week about the matches tomorrow and the matches that await us next week. Thanks for reading, and follow me on @LOLEUROCKS on Twitter!

It is in chinese. Simple Translation:

the ongoing Chinese LPL has insert a new individual ranking system called MVP rating ranking. Each match, 5 groups of experts from different sources will select 1st and 2nd choise MVP player from the game which the 1st will get 30 points(15 if hes from losing team), 2nd will get 15 points (8 if from losing team) from each group.  

And all the points will add together from these 5 groups (means a single player can get up to 150 points in a single game if hes from the winning team and also get picked by all 5 groups of experts as 1nd choise MVP). After that, there will be a total rating ranking. 

then it come to the most important last paragraph:

目前直播中的MVP值评分并没有加入玩家们的参与环节，不过每周之星的投票应该会对选手们入选MVP阵容有很大的加分，所以，千万不要忘记前往LPL专题为你心中的MVP投上一票哦！

the current MVP rating has not included any factor from viewers and fans, but the 'weekly star voting' will greatly improve the chance of the individual player to be SELECTED INTO THE MVP TEAM. so please dont forget to vote for ur MVP (weekly star only will be 1 player each match day or each weekend)


Hence that based on the current MVP rating (which i m still searching for any source that has the correct mvp rating ranking, but still unable, I will keep a close eye coming Friday morning at the LPL Live which they will show the MVP rating in the stream) the current MVP team for China LPL is:

Top: IG.PDD
Mid: IG.Zz1tai
Jungle: WE.Troll(clearlove)
AD: OMGsan
Support: OMGlovelin

In my opinion:
Lissandra looks to be your average damage caster, maybe an ice mage? Not especially reliant on mana regen, but being recommended to buy some probably means she uses it.
Zac looks to be a tanky ap jungler, kind of like amumu and sejuani, but maybe even more damage, being recommended Spirit Of the Spectral wraith. Likely to use mana due to spirit stone, and might have some form of innate lifesteal/heal/spell vamp seeing as he's recommended spirit visage.

Hey guys, I'm iPandaN, author of [This Theorycraft Post](http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/19pwg5/barely_protect_the_twitch_a_theorycraft_in_the/) about ""Barely Protect the Twitch"" that Scarra responded to (which i thought was pretty cool). Today I came up with an interesting Concept: Tanking without a tank. Again, like my last post, this composition is extemely niche in countering comps with scary damage/AoE.


**The Composition:**

-AP Galio
-AP Maokai Jungle
-Katarina
-Soraka
-Urgot

**The Theorycraft:**

So this composition may seem silly at first with it's gimmicky bot lane, and obscure top lane pick, but the depth of the synergy is immense. Also this comp requires building Urgot in a rather Odd way.

-Soraka and Urgot will be spamming their Q's in teamfights. Every 5 spellcasts near Maokai will heal him for 7% of his maximum health. The regeneration potential for Maokai is insane without even accounting any other spell 
casts.

-His ulti will make his team take 20% reduced damage in teamfights, and a Galio Ulti on top of it will charge up the damage on the Maokai Ult rather quickly while giving Kat very nice ulti potential.

-Soraka can silence an enemy that would otherwise disrupt galio's ultimate.

-Urgot will be building Runaan's Hurricane, which means that while he's auto attack their team, 3 of their members will have their Damage reduced by 15% (I assume this works, as i don't see why it wouldn't otherwise). This is rediculous.

So at it's core, what this team composition is doing, is replacing MR and Armor with artificial effective health, and emphasizing debuffs and auras, that are not effected by penetration (Urgot/Maokai). The new emphasis on penetration has made stacking Armor/MR not so effective, but penetration doesn't apply to these artificial means of damage mitigation. It seems to me that this has some potential. So if they're grouped up, in total you have: 

-AS reduction (FH on Urgot)
-MR Reduction (Soraka Q, Abyssal on Galio)
-Armor Reduction (Urgot E, Black Cleaver on Urgot)
-Damage Output Reduction (Urgot)
-AoE, Slows, Taunt, Root, Silence, Surpess
-That Soraka Ultimate

You have so much damage and effective tankiness on all of your champions that it's hard to decide who to focus, and when they do decide to focus one, you have amazing peel, a defensive steroid, OP heals, and damage reduction on the scary targets that are trying to pick off whichever champion.

**Urgot's Build:**

-Tier 2 Boots (There are lots of viable options)

-Trinity Force (Sheen Procs/AoE slow combined with W AA's between Q's for AoE dmg)

-BotRK

-Runaan's

-Black Cleaver

-Frozen Heart


With this you debuff 3 people to full BC stacks in 2 Auto Attacks.

1362560377.0,9,self.summoners,19rmhj,Double Lizard Action,13,4,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/19rmhj/double_lizard_action/,"A friend of mine just thought of builing Spirit of the Elder Lizard on Renekton. I didn't know the item that much and thought it would be useless unless you were a jungler but in my opinion it turns out to be quite an interesting idea. Not necessarily op but at least a bit creative.

------------------------

**Total Cost: 2300g**

 Spirit Stone (700g) *(Hunter's Machete (300g) + Faerie Charm (180g) + Rejuvenation Bead (180g) + 40g)*

 Pickaxe (875g)
  
  725g

**Stats:**
 
+50 attack damage

+14 health regen

+7 mana regen

+10% cooldown reduction
	
**Unique Passive:** 

*Butcher:* Damage dealt to neutral monsters increased by 25%.

**Unique Passive :**

*Incinerate:* Basic attacks and spells that do not inflict damage-over time deal 14-50 (based on level) bonus true damage over 3 seconds on hit.

-----------------

Actually this item synergizes quite well with Renekton ult + a sunfire cape, the butcher passive can also not be useless when taking barons or drakes. The mana regen is useless but since the Gold efficiency of this item is high and the mana regen not that big it shouldn't be too much of a waste. 

In fact the biggest problem here would be the building path. Machete will be useless since you're gonna be laning. Not even talking about fairy charm. So in the end, the only components worth sitting on are the pickaxe and the rejuvenation bead, meaning you will need to wait 1425g before getting something worth being brought in your laning phase. So even if the result seems appealing, is it really worth building it ?

It may not be OP and I'm not that good of a top laner but on paper it doesn't seem that terrible to me, past that building path issue. Thoughts ?

I understand Varus's key weakness is not have any type of escape, but lets me honest you do not have to fight without flash unless your team puts you a bad situation to begin with.

IMO, he just has too many advantages to counteract the current jungle and top lane meta. When blight is maxed and stacked (3 hits), he can take 15% of someones max health. This is very easy to do if you can hit his q and e. So, that is 30% max health just from blight stacks in ~4 seconds not counting the auto attacks and ability damage. Not the mention the blight stacks do magic damage which most tops and junglers don't prioritize MR over armor. 

He also has a great CC ulti that if used correctly can lock up at least 2 people for 2 seconds each. Plus, his passive adds a 40% auto attack speed increase on an assist which is typically easy to achieve during a teamfight.

Finally adding in the changes to BotRK which does another 15% max health damage, I find it hard to believe Varus isn't played more than he is just because of a lack of an escape.

Just wondering if I am missing something or just being naive. Anyone else have any opinions on why Varus isn't played more?",,False,,t5_2wenn,False,,,True,t3_19haqz,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/19haqz/varus_viability/,

1375060970.0,9,self.summoners,1j8xpe,"After 7 weeks a total of 86 champions have been picked in EU and NA LCS, will there be more?",10,1,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1j8xpe/after_7_weeks_a_total_of_86_champions_have_been/,"Week 7 of the European LCS Summer Split will probably be most remembered for Diamondprox breaking out Karma jungle, but in addition to that it was the first time this season that we saw Corki, Gragas, Talon and Vi played in Europe.


The Gragas pick is perhaps not a huge surprise considering it's not an entirely uncommon pick in Chinese and Korean pro leagues the other champions though haven't seen almost any play time this summer  (Corki was played once in NA and once in Korea i believe).


The 7th week in the North American LCS was less eventful in terms of new champions being played - the only one previously unseen was Aatrox who Kiwikid from Dignitas played twice during the week.



The fact that just two weeks before the start of play-offs it appears teams are not afraid to bring out new picks raises the question what other unconventional champions we could see before the standings for play-offs are locked. The subject seemed interesting so i decided to take a closer look.


So far the European Season has seen 77 different champions and the 37 that are yet to see any play-time are:



Akali|Alistar|Amumu|Brand|Cassiopeia|Cho'Gath
:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:
Darius|Fiora|Gangplank|Garen|Heimerdinger|Jax
Katarina|LeBlanc|Malzahar|Mordekaiser|Olaf|Pantheon
Poppy|Rammus |Riven|Shaco|Shyvana|Sion
Soraka|Swain|Taric|Teemo|Trundle|Tryndamere
Urgot|Veigar|Viktor|Warwick|Wukong|Yoirck
Ziggs



The NA LCS has seen a total of 70 different champions in the 80 games played so far and the 44 that are still yet to be played are:
*edit : There are 4 champions that were counted towards the 70 that were banned in games, but never actually picked. Nidalee, Miss Fortune and Ziggs were banned once and Rengar three times.



Akali|Amumu|Anivia|Brand|Cassiopeia|Darius
:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:
Dr. Mundo|Fiora|Fizz|Galio|Gangplank|Garen
Hecarim|Heimerdinger|Jax|Karma|Katarina|LeBlanc
Malzahar|Mordekaiser|Morgana|Olaf|Poppy|Quinn
Rammus|Shaco|Shyvana|Singed|Sion|Sivir
Skarner|Soraka|Swain|Syndra|Talon|Taric
Teemo|Udyr|Veigar|Vi|Viktor|Volibear
Warwick|Wukong




There are some differences, but there are 28 champions that are shared between both lists and a few of those are common ""hover over"" crowd pleasers during champion selcet that have not seen almost any pro-level play in any major region.



There are just two weeks left in the regular season, the last one is a super week. Each team gets to play 8 more times and that means there are a total of 32 chances for champions to be picked (and banned) in both regions. 
32 games are just a little less than a third of a season though so there are plenty of opportunities for teams to bring out new picks to surprise their opponents and through that try secure their spots in the play-offs.



Which previously unplayed champions do you think will get picked in the last two weeks of the regular season? Or has the viable champion pool been completely exhausted with the new picks in week 7? The Spring Split regular season saw 86 different champions in NA and 81 in Europe, so perhaps there is room for at least a few more surprises.",,False,,t5_2wenn,1375103053.0,,,True,t3_1j8xpe,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1j8xpe/after_7_weeks_a_total_of_86_champions_have_been/,

I've made a google document that has all the Pick/Ban info, plus the number of wins and losses. Let me start of by linking the spreadsheet and then explaining a couple of things:


[Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ar0-EIEFsQvLdEY1LWxKdUp4ZkNvZHRzeC1rYll3aFE&amp;usp=sharing)


**What do I mean by Champion Synergy?**: I've been counting the number of games played and wins of each individual champion *WITH* every other champion they've played with (not against) in those matches. (You can look that in Sheet #2, P= Matches played, W= Number of wins, simply look for your champion on any row/column and then look for another champion in the opposite side).


**Why does it say patch 3.8 in the title?**: Well, since the start of the tournament that's the patch that has been used, but that was until today. The set of matches of today were played on 3.9, and I really didn't feel like mixing them up, so... yeah that's pretty much it!


For the lazy, here are the most interesting ones:


*By order of wins:*

* Elise &amp; Nami Played 7 Won 6

Please do not take offense in what I say, as it is what I think and what I have observed. All of the players in the pro LCS scene deserve lots of support and respect for getting there so far; this is just an analytic look at the matches of Week 8.

**Week 8 Matches Day 1 Preview**

Did EU LCS do this on purpose? We have games that pit #1 vs. #2, #3 vs. #4, #5 vs. #6, and #7 vs. #8 this week. That is just... CREEPY! Anyway, on to the matches, which are going to be EPIC!

*Match 1: SK Gaming (11-8) vs. Fnatic (15-3) Saturday 2:00 PM CEST 5:00 AM PDT*

Season Series: Fnatic 2:0 SK Gaming

The Showdown: 

Fnatic vs. SK. I'm sure by now casters and players could write a book on the history between these two rivals. From IEM Katowice (xPeke's epic backdoor) to the two wins in the LCS for Fnatic, it seems that the split-pushing maniacs have SK's number thus far this season. This game starts a three-game split for SK that could really determine how they approach the final weeks of the season. With nine games left, SK sits in third place, with one more win than EG; A loss here coupled with another loss against EG would drop them to fourth place for certain. Fnatic, on the other hand, wishes to keep the pressure on SK and win another game to cement their lead on top of the standings over Gambit Gaming. 

The Strategies:

Fnatic is known as the split-pushing team. According to EG's Krepo and SK's Ocelote, Fnatic's style puts so much pressure on the opposing team that they don't have time to breathe. Fnatic doesn't team-fight very often unless they have the absolute advantage. With xPeke's play on Twisted Fate with destiny or Katarina on teleport or Kassadin with Riftwalk, along with sOAZ's split pushing with Shen or Zed, they have their opponents scurrying for cover. In contrast, SK is all about winning the side lanes and then winning big engagements. Ocelote will actually miss out on farm to go help his teammates by ganking either top or bot, giving SK another presence along with hyrqbot. Another thing to note is that neither of these teams do crazy lane swaps; if they do lane swaps at all, they will just flip top and bot, instead of putting the AD and Support in mid like Dignitas in NA.

Key Matchup:

xPeke vs. Ocelote. What Ocelote must do to help SK win this game is shut xPeke down. xPeke's play is such that once he gets a Lich Bane on TF, a Hextech Revolver on Katarina, or Void Staff/Needlessly Large Rod on Kassadin, he split-pushes. Then, Cyanide, Yellowstar and nRated hold the middle while xPeke and sOAZ apply so much pressure that the opposing team has to deal with them. Then, they back off and go get big objectives like turrets or dragon. 

Although Ocelote's playstyle usually has to do with roaming lanes to help his teammates, he and hyrqbot must gank xPeke often to stop him from getting those big buys early. Denying xPeke of farm will be crucial, as a Fnatic can't split push without xPeke as effectively. 

For Fnatic, it all comes down to how Cyanide, Yellowstar, and nRated can hold the middle while xPeke and sOAZ are ideally split-pushing. I believe that those three don't get enough credit. Split-pushing doesn't work if you lose objectives in the middle that comes from the opposing team. Cyanide, Yellowstar, and nRated have held the ground while the split push goes on. This is why Cyanide always goes for a hard CC/Clearing Champion like Nasus or Kayle, and why Yellowstar likes Varus so much due to the Arrows. 

My Prediction: Fnatic

It should be another great game between these two rivals. It's the start of a crucial couple games for SK, so they will definitely be looking to overthrow Fnatic. Fnatic will be looking to stomp SK and look ahead to putting a stranglehold on the leaderboard by taking down Gambit once again. I personally think that SK hasn't figured out a way to shut down Fnatic's split pushing, and so Fnatic will pull it through.

*Match 2: Gambit Gaming (13-4) vs. Evil Geniuses (10-8) Saturday 3:00 PM CEST 6:00 AM PDT*

Season Series: Tied

The Showdown: 

Another team that is looking to make a move this week is the Evil Geniuses, currently fourth in the EU LCS. Their quest begins with a match against Gambit, the second placed team at the moment. With a clash against SK in the horizon and DragonBorns also in the weekend, EG needs to seize the moment, and the moment is now. Gambit, on the other hand, want to keep a grip on their Top 2 spot and perhaps regain the top place by the end of the weekend, with a game against Fnatic coming up. 

The Strategies:

Nobody quite knows what kind of team EG is at the moment. At times, they seem like the way they were when they were CLG.EU, which was a team that focused on farming up until the late stage and then dominating at the end. Froggen is one of the best farmers in the game, and Wickd's edge in the top lane always gives them an edge; Snoopeh is a solid jungler and Yellowpete/Krepo are a very competent duo. However, recently, they have learned the teams can use early aggression on them to shut down their game before the late game happens. We saw a glimpse of what the new EG could be in EG's win against GIANTS in Week 6. Sure, GIANTS were penalized two bans, and EG was allowed to have Froggen on Anivia and Krepo on Thresh, but EG played a smart, efficient game and won to prove that they could perhaps keep up with the Season 3 changes.

Gambit, on the other hand, has always been an objective-oriented, team fighting team. They have the longest continuous lineup, and the fact that they are all Russian means that language is not an issue. They seem to communicate flawlessly, and know exactly where to push to get what they want when they want it. There simply isn't a team that plays better in team fights 5v5 or even 4v5 than Gambit. They might lose the early game, but one team fight win in mid or late game can cause such a devastating snowball effect, and when that one battle comes through, Gambit's stranglehold is so strong that they rarely drop games at the end.

Key Matchup:

Krepo vs. Edward. These two are the top two Supports in the EU All Star voting for a reason. They are pretty much incredible. I promise you, Thresh will be banned this game. If it isn't, I don't even know what to say anymore. The Thresh King vs. the Thresh Prince, they are both either ""skumbag"" or ""kill-securers"". The thing that most people don't know, however, is that the way that these supports play actually works in their overall plan. Both Gambit and EG are mid to late game oriented teams with a heavy emphasis on winning that one team fight to turn the entire game. That means that supports getting kills is not bad at all, as the more gold a support has, the more team fight oriented items they can purchase to help their team in the long run. So, although some might say that Edward and Krepo take too much, it actually helps. 

Who knows how many kills Genja and Yellowpete will ""assist"" these two in. But one thing is for certain - with Krepo and Edward, supports will matter, and they will be aggressive. The team-aura items will be crucial in this game, and although Snoopeh and Diamondprox will buy their share as well, what Krepo and Edward are wearing when the big fight comes will have a huge impact on this game.

A sidenote on Froggen vs. Alex Ich: I'm not sure if they'll be allowed to face each other, but if they do, it should be one heck of a battle. Alex is, in my opinion, solely responsible for bringing the AD Bruiser mid-lane into the EU LCS scene with his Zed play; Froggen's Lux, Anivia, and even Cassiopeia are amazing. EG has historically excelled when Froggen plays well, and the same goes for Gambit and Alex Ich. Although, I want to say that Froggen matters a little more because I have seen Diamond take over games before, but not Snoopeh to the extent that Diamond was on Hecarim last week.

My Prediction: Gambit

Sorry for EG fans, and you might argue with me in the comments, but in my opinion, the only team that can beat Gambit at the moment in the EU scene is indeed Fnatic. EG will give Gambit a good fight, but the cohesion that Gambit has will prevail in the end over Evil Geniuses. One thing I am certain of? The probability of this game hanging on one team fight is extremely high.

*Match 3: GIANTS! (6-11) vs. Copenhagen Wolves (7-13) Saturday 4:00 PM CEST 7:00 AM PDT*

Season Series: Tied

The Showdown: #5 vs. #6. Raise your hand if you thought at the beginning of the season, after three weeks, that the Wolves would be a legitimate threat to be in this position. Raise your hand if you thought two weeks ago that Giants will be in this position. Yeah, me neither. These two teams have been spectacular the last few weeks. Bjergsen and Exter have been the life of their respective teams, leading them to upset victories time and time again. As these two teams fight for the right to face either SK or EG and stay ahead of aAa and DB, it is good to note that they can still mathematically catch EG and SK if they win enough games. On the flip side, they could still end up in the bottom two if they lose enough games. Hence, this clash is actually very important, and the play of Exter and Bjergsen as well as the improved play of these teams as a whole presents an intriguing matchup.

The Strategies:

GIANTS and the Wolves are two very similar teams, like EG and Gambit are similar. They both have very capable Mid laners that can take over games. Exter and Bjergsen have shown through their Kassadin and Zed play as well as Ryze that they can snowball very hard. TheTess and Jimbonz are capable AD carries who have improved a lot due to pressure being taken off of them by the emergence of their mid laners. Babeta has actually become a legitimate threat due to the play of his support zyra, while Deficio has shown that he is not afraid of battle by finishing the Ace against aAa in the last week.

These teams tend to play lanes, wait till they get a lead in a lane, then pounce. Bjergsen and Exter farm up, get big items, then roam to kill. They both have had issues in the past with closing out games and letting teams get back into a game that was firmly in their control. Vision has also been an issue for both teams as it seems that at times they don't have enough wards on the map.

Of course, having a superstar in the middle lane does mean that if the superstar isn't doing well, the entire team suffers; Bjergsen and Exter, although not as widely recognized by the community as Ocelote, xPeke, Froggen, or Alex Ich, are definitely very important to the performance of their teams.

Key Matchup:

Svenskeren vs. Morden. What? You might say. Didn't I just spend so much time rambling on about how Exter and Bjergsen are so key? Yes, that is true. Yes, they will be crucial to their teams' success. But before team fights occur, who has the biggest impact on how a team's mid laner does? The opposing team's jungler. Svenskeren's play, especially on Jarvan, has picked up immensely. Morden hasn't been spectacular, but solid nonetheless. It will be on these two to gank the other mid-laner successfully, and whomever gets their mid laner rolling first will contribute the most to their team. Of course, the mid laners could kill each other, and there might be lane swaps, but the jungler matchup stands out here due to how fast Exter and Bjergsen can pick up the slightest lead and change it to domination.

Honorable Mention: Samux vs. Godbro

Both Samux's Rumble play and Godbro's Shen/Singed play have been impressive lately. With their mid laners getting all the attention, these two have become better in their play as well, and the matchup of them surviving against each other OR 2 vs 1 will be important as well. 

My Prediction: Toss Up.

I can't pick. Sorry. Right now, these two teams are on a huge wave of confidence and skill. Exter and Bjergsen are both amazing players. If Bjergsen gets his hands on Zed, then Exter might have a problem dealing with that; but something tells me that Zed and Kassadin will be definitely among the champions banned. I will give the Support edge to GIANTS, but that's only if Babeta can get his hands on Zyra, which is highly unlikely as well. They are definitely teams on the rise, teams that have figured out what they were doing wrong and fixed them. A win here would catapult either team to be a legitimate threat to whomever loses the SK vs. EG game... Expect drama.

I think a 9/0/21 setup with lifesteal quints might be effective. I was hoping for some feedback on the idea, as I have not yet tested it.

First looking at the mastery points

The 5 in offense gives

-2% increased damage

-3 flat ad


The 5 in utility gives

-3% lifesteal / spellvamp

-3% movespeed

-Either 3 gold for auto attacking champs or explorer ward or 1.25% exp



Between quints, you essentially have 4 options.


-4.5% movespeed

-6% lifesteal 

-7.7 arp

-6.75 flat ad


Now most of the time the choice is between movespeed and flat ad for adcs. I say that with the utility spec choice, you will have just enough lifesteal to make the 6% from quints worth it (you'll be getting 5 hp per hit + 9% lifesteal). Now, worst case scenario you are losing out on 9.75 ad over someone who went offensive masteries / ad quints. But, with the dorans blae attack damage, last hitting is still easy, and your trading power is intense. Any thoughts?

So to recap

14/0/16 blade and ad quints vs 9/0/21 with blade and lifesteal quints

14/0/16 has a 9.75 ad, 2% dmg advantage, 9/0/21 has 9% lifesteal, 3% movespeed, 3 gold per champ auto advantage


14/0/16 blade and ms quints vs 9/0/21 blade and lifesteal quints

14/0/16 has a 3 ad, 1.5 % ms, 2% dmg advantage, 9/0/21 has 9% lifesteal, 3 gold per champ auto advantage",,False,,t5_2wenn,1363464936.0,,,True,t3_1afba4,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1afba4/expanding_on_the_14016_mastery_discussion_for/,

With the new Bork being overpowered, even with the hotfix, and a good early purchase on the bruisers, this is even more going into the full bruiser comp.

But of course, there is the farming issue or early game. How to farm with two melee champ without burning all your mana or all your hp when you have to face a ranged Cait with a support Soraka? The advantage would be to take the opportunity of one misspositioning from Cait and 100 to 0 her with the cc and base damage two bruisers can have.

But isn't it the same for a Nunu+Vayne type of botlane? Whenever vayne is last hitting a caster minion, she's in cait range, and a good cait will harass her, and if she trades back, cait can count on soraka's help. Hence, pros came up with the switch lane solution. Switch your weak botlane to top and shut down their toplane.

Now that seems a good solution for a double bruiser lane. Get two bruisers to toplane, one in bot. Exact same scenario than our normal meta, with just a stronger midgame (we all know that midgame comes sooner in S3 than in S2, because of the same switch-lanes-kill-turrets Korean meta).

Another advantage of this kind of comp is the permutability of the three bruisers. Whenever the botlane solo feels like backing, he switches with a toplaner, preferably the stronger one, or the one that can buy a decisive small item to counter the botlane (first to reach tabi-dorans, first to reach cloth+philo, etc.). If the opponent decides to switch back lanes, no worries, you do the same. But you only send one bruiser to botlane, while they had to switch three people. This is more xp and gold for two ppl.

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JV-tKBYRzwBBGo2ZgWr_ikg40p1ckCW497Ra4RIH7Lk/edit?pli=1

On a related note: I've noticed a pretty lacking amount of content on this subreddit over the Korean scene other than the weekly topics from eSports edge. I would be willing to start up weekly discussion threads or post game discussion threads regarding the matches if there is interest.

I also have one edit to my paper. I posted this paper in r/leagueoflegends and someone brought up the point that they disagreed with my analysis of the strength of Frost and Blaze. I agree with them that Frost is looking much stronger with GankedByMom and Space and Blaze is looking weaker due to their reliance on Flame to carry them. However, I would also point out that GankedByMom's champion pool seems to be lacking and could be a weakness going forward.",,False,,t5_2wenn,1375554672.0,,skt1,True,t3_1jmygf,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1jmygf/world_championship_picture_for_korea/,

Part 3 examines the third and final game of the series.

___
###I. Teamfight 7 [21:50-22:22]

**Analysis:**

###[[Images]Teamfight Breakdown &amp; Analysis](http://imgur.com/a/00la9#0)

**Key Factors:**

* **DIG caught GGU at the choke.** Capitalizing on GGU's unforced mistake, DIG was able to use the choke to zone GGU and easily focus down Nasus.

* **DIG knew when to retreat and punished Twitch's flank attempt.** Instead of focusing all their attention forward, DIG realized they lacked CC cooldowns and retreated, avoiding most of the GGU followup, while the carries mobbed Twitch while he was out of position.

___
###II. Teamfight 8 [24:13-24:29]

**Analysis:**

###[[Images]Teamfight Breakdown &amp; Analysis](http://imgur.com/a/XJQ8j#0)

**Key Factors:**

* **DIG did not realize the terrain situation with respect each team's team compositions.** What would have been an excellent initiation in many situations turned out to be a critical mistake, as GGU simply had more ranged AOE damage.

___
###III. Teamfight 9 [30:36-31:01]

**Analysis:**

###[[Images]Teamfight Breakdown &amp; Analysis](http://imgur.com/a/v5fRd#0)

**Key Factors:**

* **Jarvan initiated onto low priority targets.** Despite the numbers advantage, too much CC/gap close was used just to hit Nasus and Lulu, leaving Orianna and Jayce completely free to react and counter the initiation and deal far more damage to DIG than GGU recieved.

* **Jarvan initiated too early.** Too focused on using their numbers advantage, Jarvan's early initiation did not allow the rest of DIG to position properly, preventing DIG from forming a proper tank line against Jayce, forcing them to group up, which likely made them more inclined to all-in focus the closest target, Nasus.

* **DIG zoned in too hard onto Nasus.** This further clumped them up, leading them into a perfect Orianna ult and allowed Jayce to easily penetrate into GGU's back line through the unguarded side flank.

___
###IV. Teamfight 10 [38:37-39:16]

**Analysis:**

###[[Images]Teamfight Breakdown &amp; Analysis](http://imgur.com/a/hoKpP#0)

**Key Factors:**

* **Renekton prioritized the wrong target.** Though Nasus was closer, he was clearly far too tanky to be focused. Though it also may not have resulted in a kill, Lulu would have been just as easy and safe for Renekton to stun and for DIG to attempt to focus down, with proper caution.

* **Renekton committed too deep.** Feeling overly powerful as he was just coming into the fight, Renekton tried to do too much and rushed forward. However, he had already used his stun, and GGU had a strong advantage at this point.

* **DIG miscommunicated.** The rest of DIG was retreating as Renekton dashed forward, preventing DIG from providing and cover or followup. Even though Renekton's decision was not the correct one, DIG still might have saved him if they were on the same page when Renekton engaged.

___
###V. Teamfight 11 [46:20-46:44]

**Analysis:**

###[[Images]Teamfight Breakdown &amp; Analysis](http://imgur.com/a/RXVAa#0)

**Key Factors:**

* **Jarvan initiated too far in front of his team.** Though there was little chance of coming back, this initiation sealed it for DIG, as it baited Renekton forward and let GGU finish him off with no repercussions.

___
###VI. Conclusions From Game 3

Outside of teamfight 7, DIG once again showed signs of an extremely simplistic all-in approach. It manifested into their initiations in teamfights 9 and 11, where engagement decisions seemed to be based on a single positive factor, ignoring the disadvantageous factors. It was also clear in DIG's overcommitment onto Nasus in teamfight 9 and Renekton's in teamfight 10.

A positive trend DIG displayed was an ability to recognize choke point vulnerabilities, jumping on openings when GGU moved though choke points in teamfights 7 and 8.

___
###VII. Final Summary

**Scouting Report**

Team Dignitas' main flaw in teamfighting lies in their one-dimensional, fight or flee approach. Dignitas exhibits a tendency to lock on to a single target or goal, opening up vulnerabilities for opposing teams to exploit as their singularly focused mindset prevents them from  the situation.

*Initiation*

Dignitas is often too focused on taking advantage of a single favorable factor, such as a numbers advantage or a partially out of position carry, that they ignore multiple other considerations that are less than ideal for them. This causes Dignitas to make poor initiations or over-commit to good engagements.

*Positioning*

In direct teamfights, where positioning is not influenced by outside objectives such as dragon and baron, Dignitas exhibits strong initial positioning, but as they move forward, their positioning often falters, showing little ability to transition. Dignitas often clumps up as they all press toward a target, making them highly susceptible to AOE. The tank lines are typically well maintained toward a single front, but paths to the back line are available from the flanks.

*Targeting*

Dignitas picks the correct initial target for the most part, though their eagerness to take advantage of one favorable factor may cause them to target poorly. They are capable of smoothly switching to nearby targets when the initial target moves out of reach, but often, the best option is to drop focus all together and retreat, which they fail to realize immediately in more complex situations. Dignitas is typically on the same page with regards to their focus, though they are not immune to miscommunication.

*Terrain*

Dignitas seems to recognize the vulnerabilities created when moving through choke points, and take advantage of the opportunity to engage on enemies in chokes. However, they fail to take advantage of the zoning possibilities and other indirect actions that would help them. Dignitas also sometimes fails to make full use of spacious areas, clumping up for little or no reason.

**Playing Against Dignitas**

Opposing teams should focus heavily on their positioning in order to take advantage of Dignitas' teamfighting flaws. Teams should concentrate on maintaining a spread formation that can be transitioned into and out of easily, avoiding Dignitas' comfort zone of direct, head-to-head engagements. As Dignitas begins their all-in focus onto one target, this will allow other teammates to take advantage as holes in Dignitas' positioning open up.
___

It is important to remember that all of the information is based on data that is 2 weeks old, a timeframe in which teams can greatly change. It will be interesting to see if and how Dignitas has improved after their preparation for relegation, and I hope to do a post-relegation analysis comparing the 2 series.",,False,,t5_2wenn,1368409193.0,,,True,t3_1e70mb,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1e70mb/dignitas_teamfighting_analysis_part_3/,

Over on the main subreddit, the European teams especially are given a large amount of praise. Now, occasionally people praise teams such as WE, IG, Blaze/Frost, etc--and all for good reason. It seems China and Korea, while not receiving as much attention, still gets more than the Southeast. But is this actually warrented?

I don't think so. I don't have the vods on hand right now (this is a rushed post, so forgive me) but if anyone here watched any of the Garena Premier league, they'd see that Azubu TPA won every single match save for one. Every single one. That's a claim that team World Elite, Fnatic, and Team Solomid can't even attempt to claim. Not only that, but they've also been doing some pretty radical things--in the final match of the season against the Saigon Fantastic Five, every single member on that team save the support built one of the items from spirit stone--notably Spirit of the Lizard Elder on 3/4 (Jayce, Kha'Zix, and the Adc who I am woefully forgetting), and even built Spirit of the Ancient Golem on Nasus. This strategy, and other ones not yet witnessed on the other scene, seem to be going ignored.

Likewise, the underdogs of the Season 2 World Championships, the Saigon Jokers, have also done fantastic this season with their adc Archie performing spectacularly. And this doesn't even cover the amazing play by the Singapore Sentinels who finished second at 22-6, or any of the other fantastic teams in the GPL.

What I'm getting at here is that the Garen Premier League seems to be largely ignored, yet the amount of innovation to the meta and the sheer talent being honed there is world class. Maybe at the all-stars match, it won't be China or Korea or NA or EU that takes home that spot but SEA?

1366860228.0,7,self.summoners,1d25gw,SEA/Garena allstars lineup - not their strongest,8,1,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1d25gw/seagarena_allstars_lineup_not_their_strongest/,"I view the current lineup as *suboptimal*. There, I said it. Instead, I think it should be 

ADC - Bebe

Jungle - Lilballz

APC - Chawy

These three are clearly the best in these roles in SEA, like leagues beyond anyone else in the region. 

* Maybe Chawy is a little controversial, since he's been playing ADC due to SGS's roster issues and is probably rusty at APC... But he has never lost lane to Toyz IIRC, and his plays over the past year should speak for themselves, **and** the Allstars have about a month to figure everthing out. Particularly as Chawy's work ethic is prolly the most sexy thing about him h4h4. I have no idea why he was entered as an ADC instead of his much better APC, and am quite disappointed that he was picked due to the rule about regions over the very gifted Bebe.
* Harleluyar is definitely a great jungler, but I strongly prefer Lilballz as I think he can communicate better. :')

Top - Stanley (dark horse Tofuboi, Zonda, QTV)

* I actually prefer Tofuboi in this lane because he usually just rapes the lane. Hard. Even when ganked all day. But Stanley is more consistent and less of a lone wolf than Tofu. 
* SAJ are generally underrated, and so is QTV.

Support - d4rkness (also Mistake)

* Taking d4rkness in this role because of Stanley at top and region limitations, would take Mistake if Tofu at top. That said d4rkness has made some insane plays both as jungler and as support (with Lulu). 

These are just my thoughts - if you disagree, I would love to hear from you. Have not followed the SEA scene lately and am not too familiar with TPS, for instance, but the few matches I've caught this season seem like same old same old.

1364494872.0,8,self.summoners,1b6wai,Damage multiplier vs effective health. Which number matters?,10,2,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1b6wai/damage_multiplier_vs_effective_health_which/,"For each additional point of resistance, you get less damage reduction. In economics and statistics, this is called diminishing marginal returns. This is because of the equation for damage multiplier which is:

DM= 100/(100+ resistance)

From 0 armor to 1 armor you will see that I attain a 0.99 DM. Compared to 0 armor which gives me a 1.00 DM, I get a 1% damage reduction from physical damage. From 100 armor to 101 armor you will see that I attain a 0.498 DM. Compared to 100 armor which gives me 0.5 DM, I get a 0.2% damage reduction. So you see, at lower armor levels each armor point gives you a greater marginal % reduction in damage than at higher armor levels.

Lets set up damage to kill you like a distance forumula: D=RT, where D= health, R=damage multiplier, and T= effective damage. You will see that the effective damage to kill you = health/DM. From this perspective you will see that each armor point will marginally increase the effective damage to kill you by less and less, indicating diminishing returns.

***

Now let's look at effective health.

For each resistance point you gain a CONSTANT 1% increase of health effective health against physical or magic damage depending on which resistance you get, indicative of no diminishing returns. Using this approach, time to kill does not incorporate any resistance points at all. Damage done to you will be counted as true damage against your effective health.

The damage to kill you would then be Health*(1+ (Resistance/100), indicating constant returns.

So two ways calculating Effective health:

1. Health/DM or Health/(1-%damage reduction) or substitute in for DM to get a third convoluted equation.

2. Health*(1+ (Resistance/100)

One indicates diminishing returns and the other indicates constant returns. I've slept on this for many weeks, but I still cannot figure out why this is. Please discuss

This one looks at NA LCS *Champion* Statistics.  Here are links to [NA Player](http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/19c6pn/just_in_time_for_super_week_na_lcs_player/), [EU Players](http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/199o14/player_statistics_going_into_super_week_at_the_eu/), [EU Champions](http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/198my2/eu_lcs_champion_stats_going_into_super_week/), and the [data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0ArSHC5_zvDWWdHFwaDU4ejh0b2haeUJrQk5QcTctMlE&amp;output=html).  

**Champion Statistics** 58 Champions have been picked (Zed and Leblanc have been banned but not picked)

**Top Champion Performances**

* Malphite and Singed have a 100% win rate and have been played in 5 games.  This is the longest 100% win rate in NA LCS.  Malphite has the 5th Highest KDA while Singed is only 23rd.
* Miss Fortune, the top champion in EU LCS, is also formidable here in NA where she has a 5-1 record and the 6th Highest KDA (7.63).
* Alistar has the highest KDA of champions with a a decent amount of picks.  In 9 picks he has maintained a 78% win rate and the 3rd highest KDA overall (9.5) 
* Far more impressive than her EU performance, in NA Nidalee is 5-1.
* Top KDA in NA goes to Draven, who has a 3-0 record and a 15.6 KDA (And has only been played by Imaqtpie)

**Worst Champion Performances**

* Graves has yet to win a game despite being played 4 times.  He has managed to earn a KDA that is right in the middle of the pack (3.6)
* In Shen's 7 trips to summoners rift he has only won a single match. He has been played by 5 of the 8 Lcs teams.  Furthermore, hiis KDA is also on the low end. 
*  Overall there are 17 Champions in the NA LCS with a 0% win rate.  This is nearly double the amount of champions with a 0% win rate in the EU LCS.

**Most Desired Champions** (Popularity=(Picks+Bans)/#of Games Available)

* Unsurprisingly Xin Zhao, the most popular champion in the EU, is also the most popular champion in NA.  In NA he shares the top spot with Kayle at 95.83%
* Noone else comes close to their popularity but Nidalee, Jarvan, Taric and Shen make up the next group from 75-66 popularity.  For Taric and Jarvan this is a massive increase in popularity from EU
* Shen appears on the worst Champion performances and the most desired champions list, making it increadibly possible he's being overvalued in NA.  His popularity has also far outstripped his results in EU. 

**Least Desired Champions**

There are about a dozen champions with very very small popularity with 1 or 2 picks or bans.  In NA most of these low picks have a 0% win rate..

* Tristana may be an undervauled pick.  She is 2-0 with the 4th Highest KDA. Her wins have also come on 2 different teams.  It will be interesting to see if any other teams give this Yordle a try.
* In 24 games Karthus has only made 1 appearance, but I'd be surprised if the rest of the LCS didn't see at least a few more Karthus games. 

**Odds and Ends**

* Vi has the 21st Highest Win Rate (57%) and 9th Lowest KDA
* Thresh has 100% Popularity in EU but only 37% in NA
* Bans have not seen any major shifts besides Olaf who was banned in 6 out of the first 8 games and has not been banned since being nerfed.  Xin Zhao who was not banned in the first 6 games seems to have taken his place as a must ban.
* In all 3 of the longest victories the winners ADC was an Ezreal, The Losers' ADCs were Twitch twice and Graves once

In 1 month, eFlux gaming will be celebrating it's first full year serving the reddit and general league community with free entry, prized competitive events.  We have always tried our hardest to make sure any summoner has a place to find a friendly, free taste of competitive team play, through our Arena, and other hosted tournaments and events (including formats such as 2v2 proving grounds, and looking at combination random draw map tournaments)

We are an open community; anyone may join as long as they are capable of respecting the other members, and their right to play a flame/rage free game.  

We have our own *excellent* casting team, and an experienced staff to help us manage our events. Many matches will be streamed/shoutcast, which is always fun, and eFlux is a great way to find a full team, or a capable duo queue partner if you are a ranked addict.

Come join us for the Season 5 eFlux LoL Arena, starting in the near future.  Scouting Lobbies open tonight (7/27/2013) and run right up until the day of the draft (draft is 8/3, so last lobbies are 8/2) in the evenings, and we'd love to see you in game, or in our stream.

The last time you saw me post on r/summoners, I was attempting to determine how much an average jungler CS was worth compared to a laner - now I'm here to make the folks who are not researching as much as me aware of a new (or, somewhat new) trend in support runes and masteries: **Running low or no GP10 runes at all.**

*Circumstances surrounding this trend:*

* Passive gold got increased in season 3
* People kill more towers
* The gold influx pressure to drop wards decreased with Sightstone
* Bottom lane got more aggressive

I've mostly been looking at Korean supports, but also glanced at Krepo and with a stopwatch and a VOD determined that he does not run GP10 (atleast on some supports) either. The rune build variations differ, but popular choices are HP quints, AD quints, AP quints or, a new twist (for me): MPen.

The magic pen choice is a likely consequence of a trend in the last couple of months where bottom lane has been running increasing amounts of non-MR glyphs. Feel around with lolnexus during your soloqueue games to get an idea about the general rune choices of your opponents.

Random general facts to support your choices:

* **Sightstone first**
* Running no gp10 quints compared to 3 will delay your Sightstone by slightly more than 1 minute.
* Running 1 gp10 quint compared to 3 still gets Sightstone in the same game minute interval (between ~08:30 and 09:30)

* **Philostone first**
* Running no gp10 quints compared to 3 will delay your Philostone by pretty much exactly 1 minute.
* Running 1 gp10 quint compared to 3 still gets Sightstone in the same game minute interval (between ~06:30 and 07:30)

Let research strengthen your decisions and may we be better players for it!

Is the balance of the game too fragile an ecosystem, where any abundance of nerfs or buffs to a role can swing a champion into 'OP status' without that champion receiving noteworthy changes? Is that a problem or just the nature of balance?

So many questions.

Did anyone actually thought the game was well played?

Read that carefully, I don't mean good ""tv"" moment or really exciting, which the match clearly was, but anyone actually believes the teams played well? Hell, even decently?

I'm really curious here, because quite frankly I think it was quite poor, quality of gameplay wise. 

TSM (or at least Dyrus and Reginald, because Wildturtle and Xpecial pretty much did all they could) was absolutely mediocre with, in one hand, Dyrus going for the most idiotic 1v1s against Elise despite being severely behind, not defending the top inib tower and wasting time mid despite his team having far superior wave clear and, in the end, taking part in the most ridiculous ""base-race"" call I remember to date; on the other hand, Reginal too kept going for the most senseless 1v1s against Link, often wasting his Requim (a teamfight changing ultimate) just to get Link or pop a GA.

TSM played truly bad for their standards and there must be some internal issues with that team.

Meanwhile, CLG were unable to close the match and had to absolutely rely on TSM making the dumbest decision of not defending the base. They had a lead throughout the entire game and still failed miserably to properly finish the game, completely relying on TSM's poor decisions, like not stopping Nien from getting 3 freaking inibs.

Some might argue that this was the match of the year for the NA LCS, but there's a reason why such a silly game would *never* (or very, very rarely) happen in Korea, or pretty much any other decent Asian League, while, unfortunately, they're far from being a rarity in the Western Leagues.

*Do you prefer playing with organized teams than solo queue? Do you have ladder anxiety? Do you want to meet new friends? Do you have a love, a passion for competition? If so, eFlux may be the perfect solution to your dilemmas.*

**What is eFlux?**
eFlux is an organization that runs competitive arenas for League of Legends and DOTA 2. The arenas function somewhat like a sports league. Team owners are selected by the staff and they are in charge of their teams for the season. It is their duty to scout players  in preparation for the draft. When the draft occurs, all players that have signed up and participated in scouting lobbies are entered into the pool of eligible players. Owners then use what they have seen from scouting lobbies and other information they have obtained to choose what players they would like to draft for their team. Due to the way the draft is handled, all teams turn out with equally talented players.

After the draft, each team will play three games a week for four weeks. The top eight teams after the regular season will go into a playoff prized by Riot. Games take place on Monday, Wednesday and Thursday at 10 PM EST. The season begins with the draft on June 12th and the last playoff game is on July 18th. If you have any questions, we will be doing an on-stream interview/AMA for James and Dan, the leaders of eFlux at 9 PM EST.

**What are Scouting Lobbies?**
Scouting lobbies are custom games played on Summoner's Rift using Draft Mode. It is in these games that players aspiring to be drafted play to show off their talent to team owners. The game name and password will be given on stream and in our in-game ""eFlux"" Chat Room. The first 10 players in will participate. These lobbies will be casted and recorded for owners to review and for you and your friends to watch live. You do not have to be currently signed up to participate!

My personal opinion is no change of teams in NA and MYM will go up in Europe.


I also think if the above result holds true it will be the last time we see a change of teams in either region for a very long time.  The teams in LCS will replace a weak member here and there with the best of the rest and there won't be enough talent in the non-LCS teams to compete with the salary teams and the huge experience/practice advantage they have.  Unless burnout among players becomes more common I don't see any amateur team being able to break through after this unless somebody gathers up the very best non-LCS players and they all go to Asia for a month or two and train up which would be very unlikely.

Will it be a healthy situation to basically have the same 8 teams locked into LCS in NA and EU if it turns out that way?  Is 8 teams enough, too few or too many?

I've made a post recently about a specific way I began to approach bot lane. The path was deigned for specific advantage gained at level 1, exploiting weaker jungle presence in lower elo, and gaining very early advantage. The post resulted in an interesting discussion around support's early itemization, the trade offs and the challenges.

But in the back of my mind I kept thinking the same thing, which is the new mentality I've adopted for solo queue. **""If you are not absolutely crushing, you are getting carried.""**

The basic idea is if you are not making your enemies life miserable, gaining a kill every minute or two minutes, you are not really winning the game. Your team is winning the game. You can not say ""I won my lane by 30 cs"", and expect that to be a large enough factor to lead to victory, it's a contribution, but hardly justification for the actual outcome.

I find it interesting that this is not a widely accepted view yet. Doing well in one game is not reason to climb elo, crushing every game you get dropped into is. But this does mean you can not play regularly, the way others play, because you will end up merely ""winning lane"" by a few cs and maybe 1 or 2 kills.

A perfect example of this ""I must crush"" mentality is Best Riven NA. He picked a champion that has an early advantage, he configured his build to ensure as much as he can that his level 2 all-in lands him an advantage he can snowball into a win. The trade off is if he fails, he must become light enough for potentially someone else to carry him, but even if he ensures that he wins 50% of the game for sure, the other 50% may be an even split, and he ends up at 75% win ratio overall :)

So don't be afraid of all-in strategies, or risky (but planned) plays, because **if you are not destroying the game, you are likely getting carried by someone** and that's no way to win.",,False,,t5_2wenn,False,,,True,t3_1aoa12,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1aoa12/lets_talk_attitude_and_mentality_for_solo_queue/,

I've played this a little bit, and so far I can't really see anyone working except Corki and Ezreal. Aside from the obvious escapes, they can grab some tankiness as part of their build without missing a step (Phage -&gt; Triforce), and not be worse off damage-wise for it.

I've heard of people playing Vayne top...maybe, because she can hit 6 and duel really strongly (and has a pseudo-escape between Q+E). I'm still leery of it, but there's plenty of videos of high Elo streamers doing it. I'm just unsure of *how* and *why* it works.

Obviously, that's wrong, and the OP was being hyperbolic and ignorant. Varus is a great ADC, with strong burst damage, a fun playstyle, good wave clear, and high utility. 

As I'm sitting here thinking about how silly this guy is to think that Varus is UP, something occurs to me. Despite all these great qualities Varus has, I don't see him in many games. Being that I main support, and play it nearly every game (as you can imagine, I don't have to fight for that role often), I feel like I have a pretty firm grasp in my head of how often I see certain carries and supports. I double checked, and sure enough, Varus is among one of the least played ADCs in the game, clocking in just above Ashe, with Sivir and Corki hanging out together at the bottom. Urgot is down there even further, but despite the fact that he's played in duo lanes, he's not really an ADC. But, hey, we'll count him, too.

But, with Urgot, Corki, Sivir, and Ashe, their lack of appearances have reasons I can understand. Even if I might disagree about *how* weak they are (For instance, I don't think that Corki is a disaster like some people think; the TF nerfs just hit him harder than others, and old nerfs finally caught up. It's still very easy to outplay people with Corki, though.), I can agree that they are, in fact, a little weaker, and with the hive mind the way it is, it makes sense that they're not played very much compared to, say, Ezreal, MF, and Cait. 

But Varus is competitive with the most picked ADCs in the game. Why don't people pick him? He's no more difficult than Graves, with comparable burst damage, and while he doesn't have the escape mechanic, he does have a much more useful ult. Yet Graves is picked in nearly twice as many games.

The only thing I can think of is that he has a pretty bad winrate in the professional scene. But he still gets picked. I dunno. And there are other champions out there like him. What's the deal?

I go to a twitch stream and starts to watch a game that has been going on a while. I then I notice that the spectator mode interface cant tell me how the game ended up the way it did. For that I would like this changes:

* I would like to see dragons and barons killed. Maybe even blue, and redbuffs killed. 
* % difference on gold would be nice (hover over for exact amount)

Other suggestions for the spectator mode:

* I would also like to se gold spent on consumables in the gold tab. 
* Time left till objective re-spawn (including inhibitor)
* One bigger thing is to make the bottom infobar bar wider. That would make room to see all player info in the bottom screen. (Remove the portraits on the side) That includes healthbars, summoners and ulti.
* Replace the portraits on the left and right side with some menu for more statistics that the commentators can bring up. Like total difference in experience between teams.

What would you like to see?

1376494000.0,6,self.summoners,1kcpal,Open Role Ratings Feedback Post: Let me know how I can improve the formulas!,7,1,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1kcpal/open_role_ratings_feedback_post_let_me_know_how_i/,"My post yesterday got a lot of discussion (http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1kabiw/top_10_rankings_and_individual_player_ratings/) and I definitely think I can improve the formulas. Superweek starts tonight, and I'll probably be up late entering data and messing with the spreadsheet, so now is a great time for me to ask for feedback. Feel free to suggest or ask anything!

Some ideas I have:

- Weigh Markman deaths higher
- Gold and cs marksman weights higher
- Weigh top and jungle deaths lower (initiators)
- Remove support CSPM hit? (situational items need cs, counter evelynn pink wards for example)
- Lower support death weight

Some notes:

**Role Rating is supposed to be a measure of how much that player contributed to the team's overall performance, not how good they are.** So yes, if Zuna has a lower rating due to Mancloud being a kill machine, that doesn't mean he is a bad player - it just means he contributed less to the team's overall performance, which makes sense.

That being said, if this kind of rating system lasts, casual fans **will** take this number to mean how good the player is, so it is our duty to make sure we make it as accurate as possible. 

There was also some discussion yesterday about weighing in wins and losses to the Role Rating. I want to be clear here: I totally disagree in ever linking those factors into a player's rating. I could be totally wrong, but inflating a player's rating because *of a teammates' better performance,* or lowering a rating *because of a teammates' worse performance* seems against the nature of the rating. The Average Rating table was my attempt at judging a whole team together, and that concept shouldn't spill back into the players' individual ratings.",,False,,t5_2wenn,False,,,True,t3_1kcpal,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1kcpal/open_role_ratings_feedback_post_let_me_know_how_i/,

It featured the return of RapidStar, who had two great games on Ahri (in contrast to Ryu's Ahri on Wednesday).

I feel like Shield's picks felt pretty stale, not allowing them to really accomplish anything and putting them at the will of Frost. They did not adapt well to any of Frost's picks or strategies. NoFe looked lost sometimes, not like the dominant jungler he can be known to be. There isn't really much to say except that Frost outclassed Shield in every way.

Now the question is whether Frost just looked really good because of Shield or if they are really that strong. If they play very carefully and smart they should be able to take advantage of KT B and their throws. We'll see how the picks and bans go with Twitch and Ahri being heavily contested picks.

Season Series: 2-0 Against All Authority

The Showdown: The two bottom teams... Where they do not wish to be. Roster changes ensue. Karalius left aAa, and they replaced him with Dioud, so that only Freddy122 doesn't speak French. DragonBorns brought back Malunoo to take over as jungler after giving Dexter1 a shot. They're still trying to find out if anything will work, and if they are to provide any kind of late season magic at all, they must start against each other, at the bottom.

The scary thing, of course, is the form that MYM and Alternate, two of the teams that will be in the Summer Promotion Playoffs, have shown this season. Neither DragonBorns or aAa want to be in that position to have to play for their spots in the League. It would be a shock to their ego as a player and to the organization as a whole.

The Strategies:

This game will present fireworks from start to finish. These teams are the most aggressive early game teams in the EU scene. ShLaYa has twice teleported and used a ward to set up first blood for his team. DragonBorns does insane switchups that leave lasting impact on the whole game, and HosaN and Nono are hyperaggressive carries. Expect lots of kills and lots of unconventional plays. Teleports, tower dives, ten minute dragons, AP in bot, who knows what they'll show next? When teams are desperate, they'll try anything to win, and these two teams are VERY desperate.

Key Matchup: 

HosaN vs. Nono. Freddy122 gets a shoutout as one of my favorite players in the game for being able to mid sometimes in the place of ShLaYa when aAa sees fit, but this game features two of the most aggressive AD carries in the EU scene. HosaN is the one that plays aggressive EZ/Varus and sometimes AP Nidalee, while Nono plays an aggressive EZ as well and is known for being almost too aggressive at times. I am not certain how good Dioud is since I've never seen him play. If he complements Nono's aggressive style, HosaN might be in a battle. What the aggressive styles of play does for both teams, though, is make the importance of Malunoo and Virtu4l even more crucial. One successful gank on an aggressive carry can win the lane, and winning lanes win games. 

My Prediction: aAa

Bring Malunoo back will provide better jungling for DB, and he might be better motivated after being taken out of the lineup for two weeks. I like aAa better, though. The fact that you can't predict where Freddy will be, and the possibility of Dioud being a better fit with Nono gives aAa a slight edge. With these two teams, though? Anything can happen, and that is what makes this game worth watching. 

*Match 5: SK Gaming (11-8) vs. Evil Geniuses (10-8) Saturday 6:00 PM CEST 9:00 AM PDT*

Season Series: Tied

The Showdown: Ah. After a game amongst the current 7-8 and the current 5-6 we have the current 3-4. Are you sure you didn't fix this, Riot? 'Cause after this we have the current 1-2. Both of these teams will have faced one of the Top 2 beforehand. Whether they won that game or not will play a huge impact on the psychological nature of these teams. With GIANTS and Wolves looking up, they really can't afford to lose, and now in this crucial moment of time they play each other. The Matchups are endless. Wickd vs. Kev1n. Froggen vs. Ocelote. Yellowpete vs. Candypanda. Krepo vs. Nyph. Snoopeh vs. hyrqbot. Want to call this one? Good luck! 

The Strategies: 

Two teams oriented around team fighting, although EG could either be the mid-game team or the late-game team of the CLG.EU days. Ocelote, as mentioned before, looks to roam around to make plays while Froggen would rather farm up and get powerful. Nyph and Candypanda tend to be a little more passive than Krepo and Yellowpete, while hyrqbot would be a shoo-in for the All Star spot if it wasn't for Diamondprox. Unless Froggen does something like being Malphite again, or Ocelote does something like being Jarvan again, it should be one skill shot AP mid vs. another. Of course, they could follow the new Zed meta, which would be interesting, but these two are actually players that like playing the skill shot champions. 

Key Matchup: 

Wickd vs. Kev1n. I doubt that they'll be allowed to go 1 vs 1 against each other, although that would be epic. They've always been so consistently good for their teams, whether it be on Zed, Renekton, Shen, Jayce... You name it. They always play solid, they always know when to back off and when to press, and they can be relied upon to perform. Snoopeh and hyrqbot will play a huge part on whichever gets pushed around, but don't be surprised if it takes another lane going down for one of these players to lose their lane.

My Prediction: Evil Geniuses

Another hard one to call, but I like EG a little better right now. They tend to be a little less based on emotion, and a bit more stoic in their playing. Sure, Ocelote's emotional nature can be good for the team at times, but sometimes what a team needs is stability of emotion to help performance. Froggen and EG tend to be more focused. As two teams that are looking for the next step to challenge the top 2 as well as avoid the surging Giants and Wolves, I would not count either of them out, but give the slight edge to Evil Geniuses.

*Match 6: Fnatic (15-3) vs. Gambit (13-4) Saturday 7:00 PM CEST 10:00 AM PDT*

Season Series: Gambit 2-1

The Showdown: And we conclude an epic day of matches with the big one: Fnatic vs. Gambit. Provided that Fnatic has handled SK and Gambit has handled EG, they should be sitting at records of 16-3 and 14-4 heading into this game. A Fnatic win would give them a 17-3 record while giving Gambit another loss, which would mean that Fnatic would effectively have a 2 game lead with 8 games to go. That would be huge. Conversely, a Gambit win would almost close the gap while putting more distance between them and the winner of EG vs. SK. This game will be undoubtedly huge, and a great match indeed.

The Strategies: 

It is well known that this is the classic split-push vs. teamfight battle. Fnatic relies on speed and guerrilla warfare stretched across the map applying pressure everywhere while Gambit goes for objectives and teamfights. In their first game back in Week 1, Gambit forced Fnatic into teamfights and won in a rout. Week 4, where Fnatic suffered two of their three losses, saw Gambit build with team fighting in mind and win due to the strong front line of Shen and Nasus. Fnatic finally solved the riddle of Gambit by winning in Week 6 due to the split pushing of xPeke's Twisted Fate.

Genja, Gambit's ADC, plays caster champions like Miss Fortune and Varus, looking to land the perfect ult to help his team. Darien and Diamond play tanky champions, while Alex usually plays an assassin. With Edward and Diamond getting lots of team aura items, Gambit is a force to be reckoned with. In comparison, Fnatic values speed. xPeke always goes for champions with gap-closing or global presence ultimates while Cyanide goes for champions that have a targeted slow like Nasus or Kayle, to name a few. nRated likes Leona, Blitzcrank, and Nunu for the same reason - that he can either speed up his allies or slow down his opponents. Yellowstar is the one that sits behind the chaos and picks off enemies one by one, while sOAZ plays the assassin champion that dives in and starts the chaos.

Basically, this is like ""Divide and Conquer"" vs. ""United We Stand"". If Fnatic can split Gambit from fighting as a cohesive force enough to press their advantage, Fnatic will prevail. If the split pushing is not effective, or the pushers get picked off, or Cyanide + nRated + Yellowstar cannot hold off the middle while the push is occurring, Gambit will prevail. The longer this game goes, the higher the risks will be for Fnatic to split push, but the higher the rewards will be as well if the pushing is effective. 

As an analyst, this matchup provides such a contrast of playing styles, and the fact that they are the top two teams in the European LCS pays testament to the fact that they both work. It will be interesting to see if Fnatic can tie up the season series with the Russians. The only thing to regret is that this will be the last time we will see these two teams play each other unless they meet each other in the Spring Playoffs. Otherwise, they will pick up their rivalry in the Summer Season.

Key Matchup:

sOAZ vs. Darien. Fnatic's split pushing, though a threat with just xPeke, is even more potent when sOAZ is pushing the other side. Along with being a great solo laner, sOAZ has shown that he can indeed push the lanes as well, which has worked for Fnatic time and time again. More noteworthy is the fact that not only can he push, he knows precisely when to return to help Cyanide, Yellowstar, and nRated defend while xPeke is doing what Peke does. Having a team that split pushes requires a lot of communication and players being on the same page, and sOAZ is a testament to the Fnatic code.

Along the same lines is Darien, a member of Gambit that is sometimes overlooked with the likes of Alex Ich, Diamondprox, and Edward gobbling up all the attention. Darien might not be flashy, but he is reliable as Wickd or Kev1n, two top laners that are considered to be among the best in Europe. 

It will be up to Darien to either stop sOAZ from becoming powerful enough to split push or to deny Yellowstar from destroying his turret too quickly in the case of a lane swap. If there is one guy that can do that, however, it's Darien.

These two teams are so evenly balanced, despite the stark contrast to playing styles. This should be a great game to watch.

My Prediction: Fnatic

Fnatic is on a roll lately. The Russians are the only team to beat them twice this season, with the only other loss at the hands of the Wolves. I expect xPeke and his team to tie the season series with Gambit and put a stranglehold on first place in the EU LCS. It should be a great game, but I think that it is very hard for any team to contend with the constant pressure that Fnatic's disciplined split pushing provides, and it will give them victory once again.

Well, that's it for this time. Tomorrow, I will attempt to preview Sunday's matches.

The top 2 teams will qualify for the LCS Promotion Tournament.  However In the Top 4 currently is Quantic v Velocity, who have already qualified.  Then there is Curse Academy and

&gt;""A majority of CA are not LCS eligible. If CA wins, then Dignitas B and Velocity will compete for the 2nd berth at a later time""

So only one member of the top 4 is eligible to win a promotion spot. Does that mean the winner of Square Duck v ASU Esports tonight is going to the LCS Promotion Tournament?    

And how should the last spot be decided? A new tournament with the bottom 4 teams is the only fair way that occurs to me. ",,False,,t5_2wenn,False,,,True,t3_1blm6a,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1blm6a/ipl_summer_promotion_qualifier_discussion/,

The main point of this post to get some feedback and general ideas!

I'm currently creating a small javascript-based application to help assign the best roles for a LoL team. The idea is that you feed the preferences of each player into the application, and it will return the best possible team according to the preferences offered.

The core use cases for this are both for when you're in solo queue and you only have a short period of time to figure out who should be in what role, as well as for when you have a premade team that doesn't play together regularly.

Currently I'm still making the prototype work exactly how I want, as well as making it easy to use and understand. With the prototype, you give the app the role each player wants to get and their least favoured role. The parser is designed so you can copy directly from pre-game chat to save time, and being written in javascript, it will also not require any time-consuming page loads.

Once you do this, it assigns a point value for each role for each player, and then runs through all ther possible variations for the top scoring combination.

The current set of values I'm using values a player avoiding a role they don't want to play, over a player getting the role they want to play. This is because it it is generally being better to have two players that are okay at a position over one great player and one awful at their position or a player not at all motivated to play.

These scores will be adjusted over time, and once you can put in multiple preferences, it should not be as stark an issue. 

At the moment, the app only accepts really specific inputs and only allows for a favourite / least favourite champion due to my fairly shoddy prototyped parsing. This is something I'm going to work on before making it public, and should allow for a better focus on giving people better roles (1st/2nd best), rather than making sure people avoid getting worse roles (5th best).

What I'd like to have is any feedback from people - **does this sound useful**? Is it **something that you would use?** Would it **help to resolve issues in champ select?**

The key idea behind the app is to make it as easy as possible to use, as quickly as possible - and anything that would make it work towards those goals would be appreciated!

**Screenshots!:**

In use, showing all variations of simple team: http://i.imgur.com/BOZb5A5.png 

In use, with a more difficult team: http://i.imgur.com/1kMRbST.png  (This kind of team in particular will be much better when 2nd and 3rd preferences come in)

**Features I'm planning to to add:**

*   Easy to Copy URL reference for other teammates
*   Up to 5 specified roles in order
*   Easier to understand syntax
*   Clearer tie-breaking when multiple matchups are ""best"" in score.
*     More sanity checking (e.g. wanting and not wanting the same role at the same time etc.)",,False,,t5_2wenn,False,,Lulu,True,t3_1bq2tg,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1bq2tg/role_planner_picker_prototype_js_app/,

1363371049.0,3,self.summoners,1ad2gc,I think we itemize BOT lane wrong.,20,17,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1ad2gc/i_think_we_itemize_bot_lane_wrong/,"I play  A LOT of bot lane, in both support and ADC role. My line of thinking is not for teams, since communication makes the game completely different, I am thinking about solo queue.

So at the moment the most standard build I see is Doran's Blade on ADC, Wards/Pots/Cheap Item on Support. I think this is the wrong way to go. My thinking stems from the way laning phase works. Support is responsible for harass and zoning, ADC is responsible for staying safe and farming, while taking the opportunities that the support provides.

If support is the laner that is closest to the action, why do we not provide the role with the tools to do it's job and instead put the un-organic build of wards on it.

My suggestion:

Support begins with Doran's Shield (with Ninja Tabi as a second item.) This item makes harassing a lot easier, combination of regen, armor, health and a UNIQUE Passive allow the support to initiate fights, without giving up the lane too much should the ADC not follow through (standard for solo queue).

ADC begins with a red pot, a ward and healing pots. This allows the ADC to become tanky when needed or gain extra AD to follow up the support engage (defensive AND offensive option for 250 gold), get a higher regen than most other items would provide with a sizeable stack of healing potions, and a ward lets support focus on early game harass, while not giving up vision in lane.

After initial purchase, the warding is handed over back to support.",,False,,t5_2wenn,False,,,True,t3_1ad2gc,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1ad2gc/i_think_we_itemize_bot_lane_wrong/,

One of the things he states is that most of the community is, contrary to popular belief, either neutral or positive behavior-wise, and he is talking about 95%+! 

One of the issues he points out, and I think that's the issue, is that unfortunately this is not highlighted enough and makes people think that the majority of the community is negative. I also supose the Tribunal only makes it worse by highlighting the bad part of the community and places like /r/bestoftribunal only serves to further put it into the highlight, not that said subreddit is necessarily a bad thing but it can help giving the wrong impression to people. Everytime a thread about behavior shows up there are tons of comments similar to ""omg this community sucks"" and ""yeah, i have a troll in every match i play"" which clearly shows how the community sees itself, and that's what I think is the biggest problem.

I play on the brazilian server and I'm sure everyone here knows the fame brazilian players have and the worst part is: The brazilian playerbase sees itself as a toxic community. The thing is that it's not nearly as bad as forum posts would make you believe but it ended up turning into some sort of identity issue. Some players think ""Hey, everyone is a shithead so to hell with them, I'm going to act as a shithead too!"" and don't even give a chance for people to actually do something before being aggressive. I'm sure it's not only a brazilian server issue, it happens on any server I'm guessing.

I believe it's a perception and, consequently, a attitude problem. People see the community as a bad thing, toxic if you will, and then decide to pay it back in the same way before they are even attacked, so anything slightly wrong that someone makes is suddenly seen as trolling, raging and similars. Sure, there are legitimately toxic people in this game, I've played with my fair share of them, but my personal experience just tells me that the community perception is just wrong and that the good players are the majority here.

I guess the question I ask you goes back to the title: Is the community as bad as people make it seems? Is it only a matter of perception? If it's only perception what can we, and Riot, do to change it? And if it really is that bad what can be done to make it better?",,False,,t5_2wenn,False,,Hecarim,True,t3_1a8rzy,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1a8rzy/is_the_community_as_bad_as_people_make_it_seem/,

I posted a while back about launching a month long Pickup game competition. It was supposed to start on March 1st but due to LeagueReplays not getting their stat tracking together I was forced to find new software to accomplish this. Luckily I have found something that does just what we need to make this happen. 

LolMatches is written by one developer who I have been in contact with so if there are more software demands on him I know who to bug :D Over the weekend I recoded almost everything to work with this software and we are almost ready to go. 

But before I officially launch I would like to run the necessary live tests to be comfortable with making an official announcement. 

I will be online all day touching up documentation and running tests.

Basically I had an idea, which has probably already happened, but I would like to have my own spin on it.
I would like to find some amazing LoL players (Plat +) whether they are with a team or not, or if they have no sponsors, it doesn't matter, and I would like to ask them a few simple questions for an interview and it is basically a way of getting your name out there for free. Maybe even finding a couple of team mates or sponsors, who knows?
This series I would like to call: Unknown Legends.
Simply because, you are an Unknown Legend.
They will be uploaded to my YouTube channel, and any affiliate websites I am able to upload them to.

Obviously this is still a Beta idea, but I would love to have your take on this idea and if you would be willing to answer questions for me, also if you have a friend that is a ""Unknown Legend"" then please show them this post! :)

1363227595.0,4,self.summoners,1a9ce6,Let's theorize on champ select...here is an idea,7,3,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1a9ce6/lets_theorize_on_champ_selecthere_is_an_idea/,"Let's talk about hard barriers, and soft barriers. Hard barriers are the ones that either include things like vote-kicking or seperating que pre champ select. This is a suggestion for a soft barrier. 

Something that I have yet to see specified (several folks have mentioned it) is the side-system of honor for playing a particular champ/position. Is it helpful for me to see that someone on my team has the green ribbon or red ribbon? sure! But what about having some sort of select-able achievement ribbons (honor, w/e you want to call it) that displays a particular player's traits? These could be broken down into several different spectrum's-

*Champion Specialty-(these numbers could be adjusted for ranked stats or for normals. he ranked stats are already there, this just provides a heads up to fellow players without having to LOLking somone in champ select when they claim IM TEH BEST SINGED EVA)
Option 1:This summoner has played X number of games as So-and-So. Or Option 2: This summoner has won X number of games as So-and-So
*Position Specialty-
Option 1:This summoner has played X number of games as Support/ADC/AP/BRUSIER/ETC.
Or Option 2: This summoner has won X number of games as Support/ADC/AP/BRUSIER/ETC. These categories should be seperated by the store/ownership pages of champs that says ""pusher/assassin/mage/etc"" that would actually give meaning to those champion specifications. 

Examples: 
Now when you go into champ select and your 1st pick you can see that summoner 5 on your team has 100+wins as a top laner, you may even want to initiate asking ""bans or picks? summoner 5 you called top, u want anyone?""  

You just que'd up, and there is a noticeable duo Q in the champ select (both their names start with WEWINERRDAY or something). They request to play bot lane together, and guess what? Rather than bringing all the baggage of all the other duo Q's that have given up double kill firstbloods in the first 2:30, you notice that this duo Q has over 50 games played as Support and ADC. They may suck, but they are at the same elo as you, so instead of raging and complaing because you really wanted to play graves/caitlyn/trist, you let them do their thing!

The real backbone of this is that it's customization and changeable for each summoner. Maybe you have more than 2 slots open for achievements-you now have to select, just like with masteries and rune pages, which you want to show your teammates. That way when you enter champ select/que the other player's already know what you are GOOD/experienced in. 

I don't think this creates a HARD barrier to the current situation and thus there are potential problems such as 3 people coming in with 1 or more of the same achievements coming into champ select. But that being said even if you don't get what you want (specifically in ranked) you can still be confident that the player next to you playing your champion or position is competent and is in the same elo using similar champs/positions.

1362180737.0,4,self.summoners,19hr91,Coaches and some ideas on how Lol's matches might benefit if they could do more then worry during a math.  ,5,1,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/19hr91/coaches_and_some_ideas_on_how_lols_matches_might/,"So after that sit down with the managers during the LCS a couple weeks ago it made me think on their comment that during the match all the can do is worry.  

That made me think and wonder about things that coaches do during a match in other sports.  And that made me realize most coaches are actively involved during the entire game of pretty much every other sport in existence with the exception being a solo player sport, like golf but they have a caddy who can make comments during a match.  

So why then are coaches forced in a team sport like LoL to take a step back?  Obviously it makes more sense in a solo sport like SC2 where the coach only gets to talk between rounds.  But their team leagues get the coaches very much involved.

So here are things from other sports i see coaches do during a game and how i think they could work for the betterment of lol if Riot would think on them.

1) Most coaches are in charge of subbing under performing players during a match or giving key players a break during low action moments.  I started with this because it's probably the one that has the least impact for LoL. You can't sub mid game it just doesn't work.  However, now that every team requires a sub to be in LCS during tournament style best of 3 matches i think being able to make calls on switching players between matches could be something cool that could be very easily implemented at every major tournament. Another fun potential is for the Teams that have A &amp; B rosters and i could see them maybe making one team and rotating them based upon oppositions or fusing them for a cool C comp that could counter someone else.  

2) Shot calling, this happens the most in NA Fooball coaches call every play and the quaterback or whoever is incharge of the defense then can make on the fly adjustments.  This one was used once because it wasn't stated as being against the rules by curse NA.  All i remember was Saint going it was amazing, he didn't have to think about buffs i had the coach wispering in my ear all the timers.   Just think if the coaches could be your eye in the sky it would completely change the game catch that a person didn't place a ward in the tribush and tell him to back up they could be going for a gank.   This allows the players to just focus on the game and i bet we could see a lot more amazing plays if the players could take some of the out of game memorizing off their minds.

This would probably be the most controverisal of all my ideas as it would fundamentally change how LoL is played, it might make the game more passive, it might make it more aggressive as people will have much better ideas of whats up on the other team.   I think Riot should experiment with this a little bit personally.

3) Being in on Champion Select picking.  Sometimes i feel a lot of these teams are loosing on champ select.  Their team comp has an over sight of no hard engage against an enemy poke comp etc, etc.   Yea it should be the players picking the champs but i feel a coach would add a lot to conversations between players as they go through picks and bans.  Providing an almost 3rd party opinion.  It could be like a boxing match where the coach provides opinions on strategies and tells you tendencies of the enemy team then the coaches leave the room as the match starts.  

4)  Timeouts - One thing most competative esports games lack is the ability for people to take a break players are sometimes forced to sit through a tough neck and neck battle for 40-80 minuets where the fate of one miss play can result in you loosing everything.   Yet if the coaches could put a 2-5 min break once or twice in a match to let the team calm and rethink their strategies it could result in much more interesting matches i feel.  

Obviously something like this would need rules like in sports.  You can't call a timeout mid teamfight for instance.   After a team fight happens you cannot call a timeout until the entire team has respawned giving the winning team time to ride the momentum and make a play etc.   

Another perk/downside of this is timeouts can force a quick commerical break and that's another spot where these struggling tournaments could earn some income rather then the 3-20 min between matches.   

Sorry it's long but i thought that's what this subreddit is for.  I'd love to see if anyone had any other ideas or what people thought of my ideas.  

Sorry for the bad grammar. :(

I played through the first couple of matches, and I felt really good when completing a series. After playing while I discovered I really hate the aura around the players in ranked. A lot of the time it was down right unpleasant to play a game I loved. I continued to play ranked in aims to move up, while still having a horrible time in the games. I rarely have to deal with stuff like I see in ranked in solo que, which feels less stressful. 

I am not blind though, after a while I think ""something is wrong"". I figure am really not having fun, and still am compelled to play. I start to think it was something psychological, but I dismissed that as crazy. I later re-watch [an old episode](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=KbtAn3dic-g) of Extra Credits and the experience of ranked comes to mind while watching. This is when I got the idea to come to Reddit and discuss it with the community.I don't think Riot knew completely what they made, with the new ranking system. 

The way it ranked now is kind of under handed, it conditions you to play more when you're not really having fun. This will only degrade the communities demeanor. The Skinner box method currently in place is breaking down the community, by getting people who don't actually enjoy playing to continue. This causes a ripple effect that keeps going deeper; one toxic(conditioned to keep playing) spreads his bad attitude onto his team, who keeps playing in their bad moods...and so on. This now conditions a negative connotation of the game, and every time one of these players play they are in a constant bad mood. This cannot stay like it is or it may destroy the games scaffolding, and cause it to tumble into itself. A game without a solid community will fall.

**TL;DR The current way ranked is set up it promotes Toxic play.**

1361975127.0,2,self.summoners,19bsyg,Changed BotRk and S3 changes on forgotten Sivir,2,0,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/19bsyg/changed_botrk_and_s3_changes_on_forgotten_sivir/,"Hi fellow Summoners,  
at first, english is not my first language, but i try my best to write a correct post down. Second, i'm neither a high elo player (on my way to plat and higher) nor a LoL-Theorycraft-Monster. I used to be one at my old WoW-time, but i never read and got into the LoL-Calculations. Hopefully someone will be nice and can backup my thoughts with some math.  
And i'm not a master at reddit-formatting, but i will try my best here too and will edit it, if something looks weird or something.

******

Now i jump straight into my thoughts.

We all got the new posts and calculations about the incoming changed BotRk and which ADC would fit with it and why, but why do we all leave out and forget about Sivir?  
*I won't discuss the strength and weaknesses of Sivir here, only how she got buffed or perhaps nerfed with S3 and how she could work with BotRk.*

#####I start with the item-changes with the S3 patch:

&gt;Values on Attackspeed and Movementspeed got lowered and the costs increased.  

Isn't that a indirect buff for Sivir in form of her ""Ricochet"" (W) as a auto-attack resetter and her Ultimate ""On the Hunt"" (R)?

My thoughts behind ""Ricochet"":  
With the overall lowered AS-amount of all champs due the item-nerfs and the scalings with extra steroids, weren't then Autoattack-resetter indirectly buffed? Because the aren't effected by any sort of steroid except of direct AA-Damage. Here i know, it is hard to time the resets in the later stages and get the full potential, but in the early stages of the game, the AA-reset gets used almost always.

Now ""On the Hunt"" (Ultimate):  
We all saw the nerfs to Nunus Bloodboil, because it got to strong with the S3-Itemchanges, but still Sivirs Ultimate ""On the Hunt"" is untouched. It is now the best team-steroid in form of AS and MS you can get. We all know the way it synergyses with in different Teamcompositions and with other Champions.  
*Hope somebody can back me up here, with some math, how much more worth the Ultimate is now in Gold or something like that.*

####BotRk-Train####

With a jump on the BotRk-train now, i hopefully can show some benefits Sivir brings on the table, how she could synergies with BotRK.  
Pro:  
At first, her kiting abilities will sky-rocket with that item. Her passiv ""Fleet of Foot"" is already good for kiting or chasing enemys, but with the increase of the active from BotRk, she could just rush away/after an enemy.  
Next up is her ""Ricochet"". With a spike at mid-game when AS-values aren't that high yet and other AS-steroids can't show their potential, she could get more AA's off than other carries or bruisers. Due this she will benefit quite well from the passiv of the Item.  
Con:  
Her damage as a poke machine gets lowered in mid-game, because she doesn't have that high bonus AD from BotRk in comparison to BT or IE which count for her ""Boomerang Blade"" (Q).  
Her ""Ricochet""-Bounce damage is lower, same reason as with ""Boomerang Blade"". BotRk only effects the first target of the modified AA-hit, not the following.

On top of that: other Champions which want to build BotRk on their own, like Jax, will love your Ultimate even more now.

*****

Sivir got indirectly buffed with the S3-Itemchanges and gets some more potential from Item which came into the game.  
In my opinion, actually she's quite underrated and people forgot about her, show this girl some love. I know she got her own strength and weaknesses in lane and matchups, but she should be in a better spot now.

I know, I probably could have forgotten some aspects of her gameplay, deeper mechanical skills and other stuff around her, but we all should get great conclusions together.

Thanks for reading, hopefully we can get some nice discussion about the lost girl.

1374821512.0,1,self.summoners,1j30wk,Here Is What It Would Take For VUL or TSM To Overcome C9 In LCS,3,2,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1j30wk/here_is_what_it_would_take_for_vul_or_tsm_to/,"Out of curiosity, I started calculating what it would take for C9 to clinch first place, or for TSM to overtake C9.  Since VUL is actually ahead of TSM, I did them too.

* ** 

## How TSM can come in 1st

Lets say, theoretically, TSM manages to win all nine of their upcoming games (C9 C9 CRS CRS CLG CST DIG VES VUL).  That will leave them at 19-9 at the end of the season.

Now C9 has two guaranteed losses in this situation, both against TSM.  In their last nine games, they face (CRS CLG CST DIG DIG VES VUL TSM TSM).  Being completely and over-the-top optimistic in favor of TSM here, I'm gonna pretend something happens to C9 and they start losing.  They lose all their games against CLG, CRS, DIG, and VUL, along with TSM having won every game magically.  That leaves two games for C9, one against CST, and the other against VES.  If C9 win those two games finally after their sad losing streak, that will TIE them with TSM, with both teams having a 19-9 record.

* **

## How VUL can come in 1st

I also have data for VUL replacing TSM in this magical winning spree (this is a completely new scenario, unrelated in complications to the first two paragraphs).  If VUL win all their games (CL9 CRS CLG CLG CST DIG TSM VES VES), they will end the season being 21-7.  C9, being 17-2 right now, would have to win four games to tie it back up.  Let's assume C9 beat CST and VES, they now have to also win two against CRS, CLG, DIG, DIG, TSM, or TSM.

* **

As of tonight (post-W7D1), C9 seems unaffected by the turret changes which some people predicted might hinder them (I haven't actually watched their games today against VES and CST yet).  If there's any TSM or VUL 1st place hopefuls out there, this is what we need to watch for.

Anyway, I figured out that his W heals less than Xin's W even though Xin's abilities doesnt cost health.

* Xin's W: HEAL: 26 / 32 / 38 / 44 / 50 (+ 70% AP)
* Aatrox's W: HEAL: 20 / 25 / 30 / 35 / 40 (+25% bonus AD)/ENHANCED HEAL: 60 / 75 / 90 / 105 / 120 (+75% bonus AD)

Also, his ult is weaker.

* Xin: TOTAL PHYSICAL DAMAGE: 75 / 175 / 275 (+ 100% bonus AD) (+ 15% of enemies' current health)
* Aathrox: 15% (+ 1% per 100 AP) of their current health. (and no cc)


And he has less HP regen. 

* Xin: 7.0 (+0.7) 
* Aathrox: 5.75 (+0.5)	

I know there is an enhanced heal, but still it heals so little and his abilities cost so much health. I don't know what to say about that. I think he will be fine, but any other champion will do his job better. Basically, in my opinion he is weaker version of Xin.

What is your opinion on Aatrox right know?

If you are interested in him there is few vids from PBE.

Here is a summary of what's done and what's next. Plus presentation of what is supposed to do the tool for you.

Full blog : http://fawardev.wordpress.com

**Completed :**

* Champion Model
* Tested for normality on some values (  Health and Mana)
* UML diagrams are good to go for a while as the next part is going to be Maths

**Next :**

* Extracting data to create the Sourcefile (in process)
* Reader Class to read and use the Sourcefile which contains every champion's availaible informations
* Create the output file, for generated ratings
* Automated Normality Test inside the tool
* Internal Database of Champion Models
* Internal Database of modified Champion, IE Summoned Champions
* Develop the Rating Model based on the normal distribution (Think  it might be from 0 to 50) (Maths)

**Goal to achieve :**

* Generate the ratings for every stats for each champions
* Create rating for specific Roles/Tactic, exemple : Harrass, Deny, *Pushing, Ganking, Sustained Fighting ... (cross ratings)
* Evaluate Match-ups
* Evaluate duo
* Evaluate Team Composition
* Calculate a Win probability for a 5 vs 5 or 3 vs 3
* Take into account runes, masteries, items when possible (IE not on ennemies as you don't know masteries and runes)
* Role Profiles to analyze matchup more accuratly and allies
* Item Rating depending on game time (Early, Mid, Late ), not role specific
* Champions' Pros and Con (summary)
* No votes or game results used, not affected by unskilled summoners, trolls and always up to date.

**What it should do for you :**

* Better bans
* Better picks
* Beta testing builds
* Better Team
* Better understanding of what your champion is able to do.
* Beta testing  new meta
* Help you design custom champions for fun? @LoL's forum
* Know has much as pro learned by themselves

It won't be a simulator, so please don't argue about situational exemples and complexity. It is not the point. It is intented to be some sort of Calculator which can be proved wrong by more experienced players kicking less experienced players or a good dragon/baron/towers push giving edge to the team.

It is developed to help you make better choices. It's still up to Summoners to pull the game out and play it' their very best. Plus, simulators would be worthless for this game as any champion can kick any other champion's ass (not necessarily easily but possible) by doing random tactics.

Keep sharing and discussing,

Crosspost from /r/Leagueoflegends,5,4,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1iu6zt/riot_hasnt_touched_katarina_since_february_and/,"http://na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=3060867&amp;highlight=katarina

If people follow TiensiNoAkuma they'll recognise this post he made at the end of January, 2 days before patch V3.01, the patch that took Katarina from a FOTM tanky AOE dps mage into one of the most consistently lowest win rate champions across all stages of play.

Right now she sits at 47.53 average win rate, that's roughly

47.8% in Normals

47.5% in Ranked (47.2 Bronze, 47.5 Silver, 46.5 Gold, 47.5 Plat, and roughly 47.3 in Diamond (but her popularity is so low in Diamond these results aren't accurate)).

I'm not here to complain whether she's UP or OP, just that she's obviously not in a good spot in terms of popularity and win rates no matter what ELO she's being played in, and given how long she's been like this I feel it would be great if Riot would take a look at some of the suggestions in the thread above.

I just made this thread to see if there were any Katarina players around that feel the same, or people that think she's fine just the way she is.

1373305794.0,0,self.summoners,1hvkua,The problem with Thresh is that his souls are too easy to collect.,4,4,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1hvkua/the_problem_with_thresh_is_that_his_souls_are_too/,"I have an idea about Thresh. 

* Make Thresh's lantern unable to pick up souls. 

* Reduce the drop of souls but maybe increase the armor worth of it by something like 0,3-0,5.

This means Thresh has to walk near the souls to pick them up, means you can just harass him at that point.
Why? Even if you zone Thresh, he can just drop his lantern and get the souls. **This completely destroys the main part of zoning since you are not denying anything from Thresh when you consider the souls collection part** (except from CS or xp). He will lose *some* souls, but zoning him won't make that big of an impact.

Making the souls worth more but reducing their drop rate with the lantern not being able to pick up souls, makes him have to actually THINK a bit. Either you don't get those souls or you go for them and get some freaking harass for once.
Phreak on the champion spotlight said that *Thresh should consider if taking souls is really worth it or not*. *""Oh ok it is not worth it, because i will take damage, let me just throw a lantern and don't worry about it.* Unless Thresh is maxing lantern, he will not have a problem about it being on cooldown, because he has plenty of other tricks besides the lantern to make your initiation (if you decide to) be blocked by his CC abilities.

The lantern does not even give that much of a shield, Thresh players usually don't even max it, making it relatively useless. Until late game. Yes i know where you escape from the jungler with you lantern, but usually you are ready for it by backing up and placing yourself in a position where the AD carry will be safe when they use the lantern.

So... Yes i agree the lantern is very good for running away, but you have to be *way* back for it to be effective, because most Thresh player will try to harass the player rather than staying back to pull back your AD carry. 

**Meaning,** the lantern is not very useful in this situation, because you are not ready to pull your AD carry back and you are rather trying to kill the enemy with your CC abilities.

**Also** most Thresh players get boots of mobility, which is very good for Thresh, **but** you will only get it after you got maybe 2-3 items. You will usually be a lot slower than your AD carry (in lane phase of course)
___________________________________

**Conclusion**: Make Thresh lantern unable to pick up souls with the addition of increasing the souls armor, but decrease the drop rate. Meaning Thresh has to chose to take harass for once to take the souls or leave them and lose the armor he could have gotten.
This makes Thresh much more easily harass-able, rather than the opposite.

**TL;DR:** The lantern is literally is just used to collect souls. Remove the ability to collect souls with it and it might fix Thresh into balance, because he needs to collect them by going to them, rather than throwing his lantern.
_________

The lantern gets a lot more useful lategame, but thinking very carefully, it is not as useful in lane phase. If you do not see the enemy jungler coming, you probably won't be ready to use the lantern mobility...the only thing you will be using is the shield.

*Sounds a bit crazy that i am saying this ability is kinda useless and therefore we have to nerf it even more... but this might just be crazy enough to work.

I get what they do. That's not what I mean what I don't get is why they exists.
Because of the fact all champions get boots you have to get them other wise you would never get away form anything.
But what if boots where removed entirely.
I know some items and ability give you movement speed and that's what that champion would have as an advantage over others BUT in place they might be lacking in other areas (Less AP or AD) evening it out making slower champs (with only their base movement speed) to rely on stronger in other areas. I know if boots where removed movement speed on rune pages (much like armor) and Masteries would soon become a norm but then they sacrifice those rune slots away form AD or AP ect. this would make you think more bout what you really want and if you really need that movement speed.
I'm not saying that we should leave all champions with their base movement speed as it is now but why not buff all champions movement speed like they have level 1 or so boots and then remove boots so each champion is already as fast as if they had boots but open up that item slot letting you to build defensive or aggressive with out having to save space for boots. I know you can get boots that fit in to your build with attack speed and MR and armor but items that aren't boots give you better stats on those things.

TL:DR Having an extra item slot over having boots with higher build in base movement speed.

1364867544.0,0,self.summoners,1bhhoj,A Look into CLG's Champion Select and why Less isn't exactly More,2,2,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1bhhoj/a_look_into_clgs_champion_select_and_why_less/,"So a lot of people are looking at CLG and thinking ""this protect the Doublelift strategy doesn't really work anymore"", yet they're still in 4th place at 10-10. So why isn't CLG any better or worse than they are? If this strategy works so well, they should be in first place but if it is old news they should be much worse..so how is CLG staying on par with the other LCS teams? 

They seem to have this bad problem of losing at champion select. As we all know, the strategy CLG runs is the old meta, which is to protect your AD Carry, allow them to farm up (not that this is a major problem with CLG because we've seen how good Doublelift can be), and just let him carry them to victory. But with the same champions, this strategy is becoming so predictable that I don't think it will work any longer, and here's why.

CLG has played 20 games this season (note that these stats include the 2 games without Chauster where Jiji filled in)

HotShot: Despite being solid in the top lane at times, he continues to play only tanks. 5 times with Malphite and 5 times with Cho'Gath, along with 2 games in top as Shen means that in 12 out of 18 games he's played a known tank. 

Chauster: In 12 of his 18 games in the LCS, he has played Lee Sin or Jarvan IV. Granted these are standard picks, he began to slightly look out of the box with Nunu and Wukong, but has since gone back to old staples. 

Link - Consistently plays new champions, he's only played 3 champions more than once (Lux, Syndra and Orianna), and when he played in Top Lane during MLG Dallas he picked up Rumble and Elise.

Doublelift - He didn't touch Vayne until week 3, but once he did, he didn't leave her until she was banned against him in every game since. Regardless he's only played 6 AD Carries, one of which is Urgot, who he hasn't touched since week 2.

Aphromoo - Loves his Lulu, who he has played 8 times out of 20, but also plays Alistar and Taric 3 times each.

So note that while all of this has gone on, and CLG has stuck with their old standards, other teams are innovating and playing other champions. HotShot may not lose his lane often, but at the same time, tanks are slowly falling out of favor due to items like Blade of the Ruined King, and brusiers who do more damage (Elise, Singed, Jayce, Rumble, etc.) are more beneficial to teams. CLG should start wondering when a consistent 3rd threat would be beneficial.

Chauster sticks to the staples of the Jungle (Xin Zhao, J4 and Nasus as of late), but has yet to pick up other junglers like Volibear and Vi, and has yet to really show an innovative side like NintendudeX or Crumbz. For a player who really tries to show his knowledge, he hasn't done much to really innovate at his position. His low champion pool also doesn't seem to be helping the team.

Doublelift seems to finally be realizing his issues of not being able to carry CLG with Vayne constantly, as other teams realize that he is the major threat on the team. However, in 20 games he's only touched 6 AD Carries, and one is Urgot. Why hasn't he touched Varus, Tristana, Miss Fortune or Graves? When is Draven going to stop being ""trash"" and he's going to realize that he has to expand his champion pool even more than what he thinks it should be?

Aphro doesn't have much to pick from, and most people believe that Lulu is the strongest support at the moment, but i'm still waiting to see when he pulls out the Thresh or innovates in some other new way.

Link seems to have the mindset for Season 3, which I feel the rest of CLG needs to adopt if they hope to truly succeed. Link rarely plays a champion more than once, and he tries to be incredibly aggressive. If he wins, CLG is on fire. If he loses, CLG tends to just fall back to having Doublelift carry. However, this seems to be the way other teams are working and a lot of their innovations are working against CLG.

In Conclusion, this isn't going to sound like anything new. People are always saying that CLG needs to get away from the Season 2 meta and move into Season 3, where other pro's are innovating and making things work well. The old Protect the AD Carry meta is slowly dying and though CLG can make it work, they are never going to be the top team again if they don't begin to expand. There are a myriad of champions HotShot could play in the Top Lane to give them a new threat, new junglers Chauster could play, and new AD Carries that would give Doublelift just as strong a chance to carry with less risk. Most people understand that he enjoys the pressure but putting everything on himself will not allow CLG to succeed overall. So less is NOT more in the terms of CLG, because their less is not what will continue to work in the future. This isn't meant to be anything groundbreaking, but a slightly more in-depth analysis on how CLG is picking and winning or losing.",,False,,t5_2wenn,False,,Tristana,True,t3_1bhhoj,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1bhhoj/a_look_into_clgs_champion_select_and_why_less/,

1364717853.0,0,self.summoners,1bcmbm,Why I think Karma was a more interesting champion pre-remake.,19,19,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1bcmbm/why_i_think_karma_was_a_more_interesting_champion/,"(x-post from [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1bc3wn/karma_q_inconsistency/c95mll4) comment)

Discuss with me how Karma's kit became more interesting post-rework.

**1) Passive / Inner Flame**. Does the new Karma even have a passive? Is it the ""ult CD on ability use"" part of her kit, or is that a passive of her ult (because it should be)? 

If it's not, they changed probably the best 'free stats' passive in the game. Compare Olaf's passive to Karma's. They're practically the same thing, but Karma's is more decision based whereas Olaf's is more 'passive'. Olaf can use his passive to stay low HP for faster jungle clear, then pop pots at the end of the clear to gank at an overall higher HP. He can also feel more confident in 1v1s as he gets stronger the lower he gets. 

Karma on the other hand has more uses -- save your burst damage until you get hit with abilities, bait enemies in with a mantra'd Q + E combo giving you massive EHP gains, etc. Karma was the king of 'bait' supports. She was [Maknoon Trundle](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAHblvQBcVE) in support form. 

They took a passive that game people a choice and play style, and replaced it with a mechanic that is overused (Skarner, Xin, Shen, etc) and completely passive. 

You always want to land abilities, so why reward abilities being landed? (new Karma passive)

You don't always want to take damage, so rewarding damage loss gives players a risk:reward. ""Do I get into the fight, drop to 300 HP, then heal / shield from the backline? How close to 1 HP can I get?"" (old Karma passive)

**2) R / Mantra**. I'm not going to go QWE first because Mantra is the only important ability on Karma. This is the ability that makes Karma, Karma. Look at the mechanics of her kit: three abilities and two mantra stacks. 

What are you going to do with those two mantra stacks? You can only use two of your abilities with a Mantra'd bonus. One will have to sit out. 

If you use a RQRE combo (use fans to heal, use shield to damage in the old kit), you lost the ability to Mantra charge your W. Use a RQRE combo, you lose the ability to mantra the E when it is off cooldown. This sacrifices overall DPS since base Q does damage, whereas base E doesn't. Why not save a Mantra stack for the RERE, while using Q for damage (as AP Karma)? Do you really need to heal at the start of a fight, or do you want max damage?

Furthermore, because it's ability was the sort of thing you can hold in your head (count to 8 vs count to 47), you could pop a Mantra charge to let the next Mantra stack keep generating, then 7.9 seconds later hit an empowered Q, with that 'third' Mantra stack building up. A good Karma player could base her engagements around a pre-loaded Mantra stack, sort of like ""overcharging"" her abilities. You could hit a Mantra'd WQ then shortly thereafter hit a Mantra'd E, for 3 bonus abilities at once. This was useful when you were on the team that was engaging, and had high level value: ""Ashe arrow in 4 seconds, I'll have 3 Mantra stacks"" versus, ""oh no we're getting engaged on I didn't preload my Mantra before this fight"".

**3) Q / Heavenly Wave**. This is an important note because it was the only % heal in the game. Weak on AD carries early game, yet strong and impactful as a late game AoE heal on high health targets. When Riot were talking about lane sustain they didn't mention Karma, because her kit is self-balancing in terms of power curve. How about that? It is important to point out that the heal was only on a Mantra'd Q, and that the base Q was only used for damage. 

**4) E / Soul Shield**. This is her bread and butter. Self shield, shield-burst a team mate, shield-burst a creep. This ability had numerous uses. Basic mantra-less shield dealt 0 damage, empowered shield dealt healthy AoE and was her main damage ability. 

**5) W / Spirit Bond.** 

Ahh, Spirit Bond. The reason Karma was considered weak. The reason Karma was considered non-viable. The reason Karma was remade.

This single ability was the only bad element of her kit. So far it sounds like Karma is an incredibly deep, useful champion who had multiple roles to fill and multiple playstyles. Straight AP, support with a self-scaling heal, she had potential. Spirit Bond broke that potential by being wholly underwhelming and incredibly hard to use (as well as, according to Riot, an ability that people couldn't ""read"", they thought Karma's W would damage them as teammates? WTF?). It's almost sad to think how much better Karma could have been, both as a competitive pick, and as a 'fun' hero to play, if this damn ability wasn't so bad.

First things first: it deals damage. Crazy, right? A lot of people played against Karma thinking this was a weird slow. No, it actually dealt damage -- **only if you passed through the bond**. If Karma put W on your Varus, he wouldn't do anything. If you walked between Varus and Karma, all of the sudden you got hit by a massive nuke. I don't remember the exact numbers but it was like, 300+ base with a ~0.7, *in an AoE*. 

But...that never happened. The range was short, so you could only really put it on a bruiser, and who gets in between the bruiser and your team? 

Furthermore, as a +ms buff for your team, it was awkward. Sona can hit E, anyone can buy Shureliyas (even Lee, as I laughed at on Scarra's stream recently), Orianna hits a big circle on the floor that is an AoE speed buff / debuff, Jayce has a massive wall teammates can pass through. Karma had this weird position that teammates had to be in to work...it never did. If anyone finds that hilarious video from a year ago of the two guys speeding each other up and 'rubber banding' back and forth to stay in Karma's W, that shit happened *every single game*. 

In other words, it's hard to put damage down on enemies, and it's hard to speed your team up. 

Worst of all, though, is that this ability had no real bonus from Mantra. No bonus damage and no real speed benefit. It didn't *feel* like there was any change in the abilities power level when it got hit by your ""ultimate"". Q got a huge heal. E got a shield burst that was your main damage source. W got...more speed for your team? More slows for your enemy? No extra damage output? 

------------------------------------------------------

A wise man once said to me, ""don't come to me with problems, come to me with solutions"". So here's what I think would have no only made Karma ""viable"" (which is a waste of time, any champion is ""viable"" if you give them big enough numbers of their abilites), *but actually fun to play*. Because Karma was, at her core, a *fun champion*. Running around with 50 HP blocking every source of incoming damage with a well timed shield or heal was *fun*.

**The only change she needed was to her W**. How you would do that, there are a million options, but here's what I'd do.

a. First and foremost, it needed hard CC. I'm convinced you could keep her W exactly the same, but give W a LeBlanc-style snare on the empowered form. Now people make the decision, ""do I empower Q and W (peeling), E and W (CC and damage an enemy), Q and E (maximum HP gain)"". You have to *chose* how to use your Mantra, and your abilities. But that choice is impactful. If Karma got that one change a year and a half ago, there'd be no 'who is Karma' jokes. Karma would be feared. And Riot surely wouldn't have needed a year long dev time on a total remake that put Karma in no better spot than she used to be. A month from now, why would anyone pick Karma over Orianna?

b. Damage. AP Karma was weak as she only had two abilites that could focus a target. W could not be used offensively if it hit a target. In my opinion, the damage that Spirit Bond used to have should have only hit the target, with 50% damage being applied to all enemies (champions and minions) who crossed through. That way you could, for example, W a cannon creep then walk 'around' the minion path, cutting down the HP of the melee/caster minions. 

c. Frankly, while these two W fixes would make her playable and competitive, it's not the be-all end-all kit change. W really needed to be more usable as a team-wide speed boost to fit her 'support' role. How this would happen, I don't know. But it needed to happen. Would it work like a friendly Morgana ult? Would Karma look like an Octopus with 4 Spirit Bonds floating around her as her team rushed to Baron? How would a Mantra'd W be used in a purely 'friendly' situation (ie, if you didn't want to root an enemy)? I don't have the answers to this question.

----------------------------------------------------------

I haven't played enough Karma to understand the intricacies of her kit, I'll admit that. But what intricacies are there? I genuinely don't see any. I don't see Karma's making massive saves on teammates. I don't see Karma's who run back to put W on you so you both get to Baron faster. I don't see Karma's with heals. I see a lot of Karmas in game. If any of you caught Rhux go 2-9 on Karma top lane yesterday, I was the Lee in his game. I had a few choice words about his build order, we had a disagreement, clearly there is stuff that's still being worked out about her.

But what does she have that makes her truly unique? What does she have that makes her more situational, more fun, more *anything* than Orianna?

1363390021.0,0,self.summoners,1adp6s,Speed of progression in S3 League System,2,2,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1adp6s/speed_of_progression_in_s3_league_system/,"When the system was implemented, Riot (Yegg) said this:

&gt;""We're still doing the final tweaking of the numbers, but it won't be uncommon at all to earn 15 LP from a win. **The speed of progression through leagues will feel very similar to the previous system assuming a similar pattern of wins and losses.""**

[Every division in Season 3 represents 50 Elo](http://competitive.na.leagueoflegends.com/season-two-rating-tiers). It will usually take between 5 and 15 wins, without losing any games, to go from 0 to 100 LP (empirical evidence, being Google, friends, myself), and then 3 more wins to progress to the next division, making for 8-18 wins in a row. 

I could argue that it takes at least 7-18 games to gain 50 elo (a higher division), where in the old system, you got 11-12 elo per win, making for, 4-5 games (again, assuming no losses).  

Since you might argue that you can't say ""1 division = 50 elo"" anymore, I will use something more comparable: the speed of progression through colors/leagues (bronze/silver/gold/plat/diam). In S2, we had Bronze 0-1149, Silver 1150-1499, Gold 1500-1849, Platinum 1850-2199, Diamond 2200+. As you can see in the above link, this was exactly what was used in the transition to the division system; the people in the corresponding Elo ranges got placed in the corresponding leagues/tiers. 

Assuming you just attained Silver in S2, you'd need 350 Elo to get to Gold. This would, assuming you win every game, take approximately 32 games (using ~11 Elo per win, which pretty much everyone got after having played enough games). 

In the new system, starting at Silver V 0 LP, you'd need at least (and this is much more of an ""at least"" since it's not likely that you will keep gaining 20 points per win 5 divisions straight, unlike the ~11 elo per game) 5*8=40 games (winning every game). This is still a significant increase (25%).

This makes me conclude that the speed of progression is not that similar to the previous system. What I want to stress is that I feel I really used a ""best case scenario"" for LP (20 LP per win), while using a very common scenario for Elo (11 Elo per win).

What do you think about the speed of progression in the new Elo system?

I used to be a big Counterstrike player many, many years ago. I was enthralled by CPL Summer and Winter Series. It was good times indeed.

Roll on now to eSports. The LCS. Major series of tournaments and gaming. Huge prizes. Teams getting salaries. Players getting athlete visas.

But how is this different to other sports beyond the obvious?

Riot.

No other sport has a...developer. Someone who can control and change something so fundamental about a sport. And I worry.

I worry that Riot's pursuit of something that can appeal to the masses as an eSport. 

The constant balance of the game is admirable. And does help generally. 

But will there come a point where balance has made the game ultimately lack depth? Accessibility traded for depth. It is no longer exciting.

Where balancing turns it into an homogenized mess, where there is zero appeal?

Here is a summary of what's done and what's next. Plus presentation of what is supposed to do the tool for you.

Full blog : http://fawardev.wordpress.com

**Completed :**

* Champion Model
* Tested for normality on some values (  Health and Mana)
* UML diagrams are good to go for a while as the next part is going to be Maths

**Next :**

* Extracting data to create the Sourcefile (in process)
* Reader Class to read and use the Sourcefile which contains every champion's availaible informations
* Create the output file, for generated ratings
* Automated Normality Test inside the tool
* Internal Database of Champion Models
* Internal Database of modified Champion, IE Summoned Champions
* Develop the Rating Model based on the normal distribution (Think  it might be from 0 to 50) (Maths)

**Goal to achieve :**

* Generate the ratings for every stats for each champions
* Create rating for specific Roles/Tactic, exemple : Harrass, Deny, *Pushing, Ganking, Sustained Fighting ... (cross ratings)
* Evaluate Match-ups
* Evaluate duo
* Evaluate Team Composition
* Calculate a Win probability for a 5 vs 5 or 3 vs 3
* Take into account runes, masteries, items when possible (IE not on ennemies as you don't know masteries and runes)
* Role Profiles to analyze matchup more accuratly and allies
* Item Rating depending on game time (Early, Mid, Late ), not role specific
* Champions' Pros and Con (summary)
* No votes or game results used, not affected by unskilled summoners, trolls and always up to date.

**What it should do for you :**

* Better bans
* Better picks
* Beta testing builds
* Better Team
* Better understanding of what your champion is able to do.
* Beta testing  new meta
* Help you design custom champions for fun? @LoL's forum
* Know has much as pro learned by themselves

It won't be a simulator, so please don't argue about situational exemples and complexity. It is not the point. It is intented to be some sort of Calculator which can be proved wrong by more experienced players kicking less experienced players or a good dragon/baron/towers push giving edge to the team.

It is developed to help you make better choices. It's still up to Summoners to pull the game out and play it' their very best. Plus, simulators would be worthless for this game as any champion can kick any other champion's ass (not necessarily easily but possible) by doing random tactics.

1368382861.0,0,self.summoners,1e70ht,Recent reworks and a variable meta; Have riot gone wrong?,1,2,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1e70ht/recent_reworks_and_a_variable_meta_have_riot_gone/,"This is just a little post based on my observations on the game. The most recent 5 champions to receive a full rework - Sivir, Katarina, Karma, Evelynne, Sejauni and Trundle - have seen variable levels of play and criticism since their release. However, while it is undoubtable that Katarina, Evelynne, Sejauni, and Trundle have all benefitted greatly from these reworks due to kits which were just down-right unsuitable for their role, impossible to balance correctly, required quality of life adjustment or a combination of these factors, what of Sivir and Karma - whose kits fulfilled their respective roles but outside influences (such as available itemisation and the variable meta-game), incorrect strategic play failing to utilise their strengths and lack of player base led to a bias view of poor performance? This is fully speculative and of course, should not be taken as gospel.
___________

**Sivir**

For those who are unaware, Sivir used to be a fairly unique champion. She had an attack range similar to Thresh, at 425, and her W was a toggle which allowed the boomerang to ricochet to 5 enemies and consume mana per attack, akin to Ashe's frost shot in that respect. Sivir was reworked because, in Season 1 and early season 2 she had no niche.

However, in Season 3, we see push-strats and more prevelance of mana-regen items - old Sivir's main downfall. For example, the combination of Muramana + Spirit of the Lizard Elder is ideal for her old kit. I would almost assume old Sivir to be a perma-pick/ban in tournament play because of her synergy with Season 3 strategies and items.

______

**Karma**

Karma was a support based around an old Season 1 meta, where tank + support bot was the metagame. As a result, Karma required a small (but not constant) amount of gold to be relevant in the game.

However come season 3 we see much more variability in tournament play and a slight revival in Melee carries due to greater itemisation, a prime environment for Karma to thrive - particularly with AD carries being played mid more often (Ezreal, Caitlyn, Tristana and Varus in particular). 

New Karma no longer provides the same early game dominance as a support, effectively able to sustain a lane partner to allow the early ramp up period to when their scaling with levels and sustain-orientated items compensates for this - the point at which old Karma would stop sharing farm. Karma's kit also has the advantage of being optimal in early-mid game and skirmishing, another often-observed occurrence in tournament play.

I have talked to some Old Karma players and they find her new kit ultimately underwhelming; She is a support who is sub-optimal in respect to others such as Janna or Thresh who provide more utility, crown control and damage, and a mid laner who is sub-optimal because she is a support at heart, and her itemised kit falls off very quickly.

______

While Sivir did not have the advantage of foresight to allow her to be exposed to this new environment, Karma did have brief exposure. While generally overlooked as the conventional ""troll-pick,"" I have actually played and observed Karma with Yi, Renekton, Cho'Gath and other such melee champions in bot lane perform exceptionally due to the synergy of her kit with champions able to get in close and stick to an enemy.

One of my favorite parts about the job is developing competitive formats for the college scene and at this point I have a whole notebook of different tournament formats.

The current format received a lot of criticism because the fans got to vote, making this entirely a popularity contest.  I'm not saying that the players don't deserve to go, only that they are the best at presenting themselves as entertainers.  Don't forget, while e-sports is about the game, if a team wants to survive they have to be able to present themselves as entertainers, hence the success of organizations such as TSM and EG.

Many people proposed that the fan vote only count for a percentage and there should be a coach/player vote that counts for a larger majority.  This better mimics traditional sports but you still run into the issue that the best player might not bring in the best crowd.

Also I would like to mention the stakes of this tournament.  The winning region gets an extra spot in the S3 world playoffs, which I agree is a great way to help build up the importance of the match for the players as well as the fans.  However I feel that the playoff spot shouldn't go to the team with the best top players, but the best overall players.

This brings me to my solution.  Instead of voting for players, we instead vote for 2 players to represent each region as coaches, with both players being from different teams.  Then these two voted players get to select 15 players to play on the regions all star team, with no more than 3 players from any team.

All 15 players then attend the all-star match.  At the start of each game, the two coaches work with their teams to go through champion select, without declaring which players are actually going to be playing.  Once champion select is complete, the coaches choose 5 players from their team to play.  After every game in a match, the coaches must replace at least 2 players, to help ensure that the full arsenal of players are used.

This format introduces a whole new level of mind games and strategy that we currently see in SC2 team leagues, such as proleague.

I am not saying that this is the better format, but I do feel that the result would better reflect the strength of each region.

TL:DR - Fans elect 2 coaches who choose 15 players to represent their region.",,False,,t5_2wenn,False,,cloud9,True,t3_1dm186,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1dm186/an_alternative_allstar_tournament_format/,

Top lane DCs and jungle is forced to lane. Enemy jungler proceed to gank lots leading to a 5v4 snowball. Or perhaps a sudden spike forces you to DC and you spend forever downloading the new patch. You come back into the game, only to be 5 levels and 4000 gold behind. And there is also the intentional rage quit DCs. However, my proposed mechanic won’t address permanent DCs. 

&gt;**Current Issue**

I believe the main problem people have with DC’ers is how useless they are. While they are gone, the team is down a member. This means less map pressure, less threats, less pushing power, etc. When they come back, they are only a liability. They become easy targets for enemies to kill. Not only are they still worth good money, it is very easy to kill underleveled champions with little to no items. If they stick with the team, they act as an experience sink. If they manage to start farming, it will still take a long time to get back into the action. The 30 cs they manage to get would be better off given to the ADC when the enemy team members are fighting with about 140 cs each. 

&gt;**Proposal**

Give DC player increased passive gold and exp gain. The increase will be like Beginner Bot level. 

&gt;**Explanation**

You may or may not have noticed that Bots don’t operate on the CS-&gt; Gold model. Rather, they follow an increased passive gold gain. Their passive gold gain creates a timeline that dictates when they will buy the next item in their predetermined build order. This timeline also somewhat corresponds to their exp gain. 

Disclaimer: This is how I understand how bots work. If I am wrong, please no report. 

&gt;**Why**

With the increased passive gold and exp gain, the DCer will not be as useless and ineffective when they come back. This is not meant to be a substitute for actually playing, simply a small help for unfortunate DCs. It isn’t fair to have a 5v4 game.

&gt;**Common Problems**

Abuse is always a major factor to consider. However, there isn’t much to abuse here. The passive gold increase is much less than what you would gain from actual participation in the game and CSing. This is not an escape for somebody to AFK and eat pizza for 10 minutes before coming back. If you are getting really stomped in lane and being absolutely denied CS, then perhaps this mechanic would give you more gold. However, you would give up the map pressure of being in the game.  For example, the enemy top laner can push down top tower much faster if you were not there to push back and CS under tower. 

Implementation is the other major consideration. Here it would be pretty easy, no new set up is needed. The increase in exp and gold can start immediately when they end up back at the summoning platform. This would be a simple server check to toggle on/off increased passive gains. 

Overpowered is a popular argument. I would say the enemy team had time to use their advantage to push lanes, take dragons, force fights, etc so giving the DC player some gold and exp wouldn’t be too much.

&gt;**Further Comments**

This is not meant to be a final solution to the DC issue. This is just something small than can help the quality of gameplay, similar to how Riot gave huge increases to armor and magic resist for DC champs so Karthus didn’t get free kills with ult, etc. Similar to how DC champs now walk back towards summoning platform instead of recalling or standing still. 

Like I mentioned at the beginning, this mechanic would do nothing to help permanent DCs as they do not reconnect to make use of the extra gold and exp. To be honest, the DC problem will always exist. Ragequitters and trolls will never go away. There will always be the unfortunate mandatory Windows restart. Replacing the DC with a AI Bot is terrible because the Bot will just feed. Replacing with a person has many problems too. Besides technical issues, there are too many ways for abuse and other problems. Besides, what if the DC comes back? Does the filler person simply just get kicked off? How would a retransition work? Not letting the DC come back has moral issues. What if it was an accidental power cord pulling? It isn’t right to deny somebody their own game.

&gt;**TL;DR**

* Increased passive gold and exp gain for DC player once they hit summoning platform

* Much less than normal gain from farming to prevent abuse

* Just meant as small help so when people reconnect, they are so useless with so low level and no items.

Anyway.

Hello! Let's start of with who I am, so you guys aren't confused about why you should even be reading this.

I am Czone, a commentator that has [recently joined Fnatic](http://www.fnatic.com/content/95475/fnatictv-welcomes-czone). Considering qu1ksh0t told me to go make a facebook page around a year ago, I should probably link it, [so here it is](http://facebook.com/Czone0wnZ).

I am a Dutch guy with a passion for eSports that has been doing commentary and other such funsies for the past few years, starting with the LoL scene more than a year ago. 

Now that I have joined Fnatic, we want to do a weekly show. The first thing that sprang to mind for me was the fact we don't really have a sort of discussion fueled podcast in the community, like NA has long had SotL. Therefore, I am hoping to do a show like that with pro players. I have some ideas, but obviously the show is meant for the community, for you guys, so I would love any advice you guys can give me! The show will start next week!

So, without further ado:

__

**The Show**

* It will be on Thursdays, right before the NA LCS starts, probably 19:30
* I will try to get pro players on, though the viewership probably has to be pretty good for LCS players to join

I will try to let the pros discuss:

* Notable events in the previous weekend of LCS
* The new champion/patch/whatever if one has been released or announced
* Predictions for the upcoming LCS matches
* Talk about meta, playstyles, etc
* Notable things like the All-Stars teams and such, when they happen. 

So what I want to know is if there is interest in a show like this and what you would want to see in it.

And lastly, I'd like some help with a name for the show! I thought of Thursday Night with the Pros, Thursday Night Leaguetalk and Fluff and the Pros, but it could be anything!

Since I am unable to change it for people who have yet to click on it please accept my apologies and read it here. It should say : Factoring in the potential language barrier, suggest some team compositions for the EU All Star team. Thanks.**

There is currently a thread on the front page discussing the potential issues that might arise with the language barriers within the EU All Stars line up.

It would be interesting, therefore, to read some suggestions on team compositions factoring in this said language barrier. 

For example, let's suppose that the top half (Top, Mid and Jungle) are from EG and the bot lane is Genja and EDward from Gambit Gaming. Now, after watching EDward's stream a little bit, it's clear he can speak English at a competent level. Would it perhap function well with him translating Snoopeh's (or whoever makes the calls on EG) to Genja and instructing him to play according to those calls?

It seems so easy to suggest that we choose players concerning which language they speak. Perhaps some thought can be given for working around this.

Note, I know that the aforementioned composition may not work due to differing play styles, the point I'm trying to make is to provide an example in which the language barrier may not be so significant.

Also, I know people are suggesting that some non-English speakers can communicate via generic phrases and commands (such as gank, drake, nash etc). I don't think this is a solution to the problem, however. Constant flow of communication must happen if a mixed lingual team stand a chance at beating a team who have the possibility of being completely on the same page.

1363120117.0,0,self.summoners,1a6398,Weak Design in LoL,4,6,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1a6398/weak_design_in_lol/,"After participating in the runes discussion and talking about how I thought it was a toxic mechanic, it got me thinking. LoL is, largely, a very well designed game. Now, I'm not really talking about balance or aesthetics, here (although I, personally, think it excels in both departments). I'm talking about raw game design. Most of the mechanics are well though out, and when there have been mechanics that weren't, they've been removed (or, in some cases, nerfed out of viability until a replacement can be found). But I want to talk about the weaknesses in the game. The things that don't ""read"" like they should. Feel free to contribute your own. This is largely an opinion thread. Since we're talking about whether or not something makes sense or reads, even if people might disagree with you, it still may hold value that you feel the way you do about the mechanic.

* Runes, as I mentioned. I think they're an overly passive time-sink that arbitrarily raises the baseline power of all champions across the board in a roughly equivalent manner, with the only real variance being whether or not you choose flat or scaling runes.
* There are still a few abilities out there that don't ""read"". Kennen's ultimate, for example, looks as though it does persistent AoE damage to all targets in the radius when, in fact, it damages random targets. There also is very inconsistent readability regarding AS cripples, if any.
* There seems to still be a bit of burden of knowledge problems with summoner abilities. Revive, for instance, seems to exist only to trick new players (in SR, not Dominion) as its usefulness is inversely proportional to how well you play. I've encountered more than a few new players who were not aware of the differentiation between the Grievous Wounds icon and Ignite. The ""burning"" animation isn't as readily apparent as the GW. I also sometimes feel like the combination of Ignite and GW is a little unintuitive. Additionally, what can and cannot be Cleansed is something that players have to learn through either trial and error or reading outside the game. Cleanse is probably the most egregious problem among the summoner spells.

EDIT: Thornmail is also something that I don't like from a design perspective. It punishes ADCs for doing what they're supposed to do, theoretically, and baits new players into getting out of position to attack someone who isn't wearing it, assuming they even realize what is damaging them.

Is there anything else that you think could be improved in the way players -- new and old -- interface with the information in this game? I'm not really trying to gripe or make a Riot Pls thread here.

I think one of the secrets to reaching a high level of skill in this game is not caring too much when you play. That's the secret to avoiding rage, which inevitably comes when you play with trolls, afk'rs, feeders and just people who are just generally horrible and make the game something which actually makes you (ME) sad.

Pro's even use the term ""try harding"" in a negative sense. Like it's a bad thing to do your best. This is generally in regards to solo queue, or sometimes scrims. 

But what happens when it comes to LCS? These best of one's are no joke. Anyone can take a game from anyone. 

You have to care.

With facebook, great coverage (Thanks to travis/Gamespot and also Machima) and twitter, we have a good insight into how the pro's deal with these losses. I think players like DontMashMe who get upset by losses, but can self critique and reflect on losses in a healthy way have absolutely the right mindset, and show incredible potential. Teams with mature members/leaders (I'm looking at you dig/scarra) have also done amazingly well recently. 

EG have had been on a bit of a tilt recently, but they are dealing with it very well, I think. And this will allow them to bounce back from it. 

GG/former M5 seem to have some unusual team dynamics, with Alex and some members being very ""strictly business"", but that's fine I think. They keep it business (which it is), and work well together. 

On the other hand, some other teams have shown very different behavior. 

One team was recently seen to be viciously arguing with eachother (the captain and the carry). While some of it might have been exaggerated, I think it probably has some truth to the kind of way things are done on that team. 

Another team famously had a huge bust up which was recorded by a webcam of their gaming house with team mates really abusing eachother. This was quite a while ago.

I think everyone knows which teams I'm talking about, but I specifically didn't name names because it's not important, I'm using these situations to prove a point, not to witch hunt. 

Professional is a word used in esports to differentiate between someone who makes a living from esports and someone who doesn't. 

But I think the people with the most potential are the ones who act professionally. 

The ones who can put ego aside, admit when they are wrong, and improve and adapt will have a really bright future ahead of them, not just in LoL but in any field they enter into. No-one likes a dick, even if he's really good at what he does. 

I'm the head of a small organization, but if I told my staff that their decision was fucking stupid and they were dicks, I wouldn't be the head of anything for very long. Instead, I tell them that what I think, why I think it, and then with all of that in mind, why I think their decision was the wrong one.

In LoL terms, it might be something like ""Ok so I think that fight near their red was a bad idea. I had no mana and was pinging back, but you kept going in. We only had vision on one of their members, and there was a high chance they knew where we were because we entered at the river ramp which I knew their mid had been warding. I see what you were trying to do, but if we had backed we wouldn't have lost anything, you know what I mean?""

The typical version is ""You fucking threw this game when you forced a fight at red"". 

It's all in the delivery. 

What are your thoughts on this?

**TL;DR: Winning is easy, losing is hard. The pro's and teams who can stay classy will prevail. **

1362651425.0,0,self.summoners,19u78f,Eleisa's Miracle - The forgotten support Item,11,12,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/19u78f/eleisas_miracle_the_forgotten_support_item/,"Hi ,

So today i would like to talk with you about Eleisa's Miracle.
I recently saw that the Eleisa's Miracle got buffed in the v3.02 patch (i think about 3 Weeks old).

    Undocumented change : 
    Cooldown reduction of Heal, Clairvoyance and Clarity increased to 30% from 25%.



**The Item is build out of Philosopher's Stone.**

We all know that this is an essential item for all supports.

**it gives 10 HP/5 and 15 mp/5** 

These are +3 hp/5 and +6 mp/5 from Philosopher's Stone 


**Unique Passive – Aid: Your Summoner Heal, Clarity and Clairvoyance cooldowns are reduced by 30%.**

Clarity and Clairvoyance are in my optinion not relevant but the Heal reduction is interesting ! 


**Unique Passive – Eleisa's Blessing: If you gain 3 levels with this item, you gain all the effects permanently and this item is consumed.**

This passiv is nice cause u get a free slot for mid/late game the point is u need to buy it at lvl 15 to get this passiv but to be honest if u get it that late u wont get the cd reduction and i peronally think thats the point why u should get this item. 


**Total Costs are 1100g upgrade from Philo is 400g**

i think the 400g upgrade for this passiv + regenerations are really nice its even 75g less than u need for a Ruby Crystal


**Eleisa's Miracle is gold efficient even without its passive.**


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


**Idea:**

If i play Leona i tend to get my Philosopher's Stone as 1st or 2nd Item. 
so if i get it as second item the game is about 10 minutes old and i am at lvl 7.


if i get the upgrade to Eleisa's Miracle next i get it at min 12 and i am lvl 8-9 at that moment.


I am still in laning phase cause of this the hp and mp regeneration is really good to raise the pressure at the enemy with constant pokes. 



**Now to the crucial point:**
I play Leona all time with exhaust + heal. 
The 30% cd reduction would bring my Heal CD down from 300s to 210s.
Furthermore the passive stacks multiplicative with Mastermind.
So i can get a total CD reduction of 37% which would result in a cd of 189s (3min9s). 


In my theory i am lvl 12 got my Sighstone and my Eleisa's Miracle these items give me vision and sustain.
Furthermore cause of the passive of Eleisa's Miracle i get a 3min aoe-heal that gives me and my teammates 355 HP (+20 per lvl) for example soraka heal gives all 320hp for a 180s cd.



**Conclusion:**
I think this item is really nice if u combine it with heal especially at times where Locket of the Iron Solari is a must have item on Junglers u negate  at lvl 12 170(+10 per lvl) + 320(+ 20 per lvl) = 490 dmg  points on all teammates u hit.
Cause of the low cooldowns it is nearly on most of all team fights present. 


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**tldr**

This item is cost efficient without its passive.

it gives me 2 min cd on my Summoner heal.

In combination with a Locket of Iron Solari (Jungler) u can negate 490 dmg at lvl 12 on all Teammates u hit.

It releases the item slot after 3 lvl.

But I am hoping to stirr some conversation up without constant NA&gt;/&lt;EU LOLOL trolls as is seen in /r/leagueoflegends.

Recent commotion has occured around 4-win IP boosts for NA server downtime. This has, as always, sprouted up tons of posts by angered EU citizens feeling that their problems are always dismissed with a ""we'll make it better, promise"" instead of some kind of compensation. Be it in the way of IP boosts/RP, server improvements or simple acknowledgement/attention by Riot, they feel it to be lacking.

Being an EUW summoner, I have been in the dreadful pre-server-split period of +2 hour queues each night. I am therefore reasonably biased at this point/discussion, since I can't forget the months of ""waiting for a solution, this is inexcusable""-posts by Ymir, and no one else.

Is this idea of favoritism (like mine) fueled by old anger/frustration/trolls, or is the feeling legitimate for EU summoners who are having problems and not as much focus as NA? Is Riot in other cases ""unfair"" in aiding NA compared to EU, for example in LCS focus, Summoner Spotlights or simple forum attention?

TL;DR

Many EU summoners feel that NA is Riot favorite for compensation/attention/focus. Is this partly true, is this biased jealousy by kids wanting free stuff or could/should Riot focus more attention towards disgruntled customers in EU somehow?

Hey guys, I'm iPandaN, an avid Theorycrafter and active user on this subreddit. I've posted a few theorycrafts on this subreddit that made front page, and here's my next one :)

If you were interested in my previous posts they were:

and

[Barely Protect the Twitch](http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/19pwg5/barely_protect_the_twitch_a_theorycraft_in_the/), I think Scarra commented on this post. I can't remember which one it was. Oh and Scarra if you're reading this, Thanks for all of the insightful comments i've seen you post on Reddit. :)


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


**The Strategy:**

Let's assume we're purple side and we lane swap so our adc and support 2v1 top and our ""top"" (Which will be Galio for this example) 1v2 in bottom. So what's been happening is the junglers will do their routes and then 3v1 in top and bot which means they can take the towers uncontested really early, but if purple's jungler starts red or goes wolves, smiteless blue, red, wraiths. He can go bot when the enemy jungle is bottom. This means we have a 2v3 in bottom, and still a 2v1 in top lane.

Blue team is cutting EXP 3 ways in bottom lane as long as they are trying to siege 3v2. But Purple team is taking Olaf/Vi/Maokai in the jungle with a Galio solo bottom (who can TP and get Chalice, wards, and more pots) can wave clear so easily. And when the wave isn't pushed all the way Blue team cannot dive them. So as long as blue team's jungle is bottom he's putting his team behind, but meanwhile the 2v1 top lane is pushing up.

**With this scenario kind of layed out 4 things can happen:**

- **#1** Blue side takes bottom, and Purple takes top

This could still happen, but if this is the case, Blue is still slightly behind from cutting exp 3 ways for a minute.

- **#2** Purple takes top and holds bottom

This is the best case for Purple. Puts them at a great advantage. 

*In my head the team comp here is Twitch Zyra Galio Kha'Zix and Vi. This means Kha'Zix Can ward enemy blue --&gt; head top, because we know jungle was just bot, and then Galio can then go mid lane. The ADC and Supp go B and then head bottom, which the jungler theoretically Holds until they arrive.*

- **#3** They both Hold

This is again better for purple, because blue cut exp 3 ways. (Mind you Blue sides solo lanes are still getting full EXP while one of Purple sides solo lanes is getting EXP cut, so you can still argue they're kind of even. Overall though, purple side has gotten more EXP in total than Blue side, assuming neither mid lane has not gone B.)

*Also in my head this is better for purple, because theoretically they have a twitch who has a phenomenal late game, and
Farming Up and Stalling (I prefer Prolonging as you're still being aggressive using your lead to take objectives and further it) is always going to benefit the team with the Hypercarry more than the team without it (mind you both teams could have hypercarries, but alot of the teams running the 4 minute tower laneswap strategy are taking ADC's like MF)*

- **#4** Blue take bottom tower and holds top tower

I think this is rather unlikely, because 2v1 lane top with a ranged AD will always secure you AA's onto tower, but in the situation that blue takes bot sooner than purple takes top, Kha'Zix has the option to safely ward enemy blue on his way to towerdive 3v1 or take tower and force their top away from it. Meanwhile Galio is coming mid to hold. and Jungler goes back to farm jungle.

This most likely means that blue side is now going to dragon, knowing there will soon be 3 top, and bot lane is pushing towards inner turret.

This is probably the worst outcome for purple, but also the least likely.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


**Conclusion:**

3 Out of the 4 Possible outcomes of this scenario will benefit purple side more than they will blue side. Seems legit, but I no longer play on a ranked team (hopefully that will be changed soon, as i plan on starting one up in the near future). I'd love to hear what you guys think! Feel free to comment/ask questions, as I will respond to most, if not all of them! :)

The reasons why I think why it is less entertaining:

Most of the games aren't even close - This is also a big problem I have with other sports (football, baseball, etc). I hate watching stomps; there's no excitement. I'm watching to be excited, I'm watching to see both teams use absolutely everything they have to win. I want to see competition, not a top 3 team roll over GGU or Vulcun.

I want to see the best - I think a large reason sports and e-sports are entertaining is because people like to watch the people who are the best at what they do. Frankly, NA teams aren't the best at what they do. I know it becomes stale to hear people say ""NA is trash."" ""NA is going to get crushed at worlds."", but it's true. I became hopeful after seeing how strong Dig and Crs are playing, but after seeing both of them lose to international teams just reminded me that this stale stereotype is still true. I understand that they were just two bo3s but they were both 2-0s and the Crs v KT games weren't very close. This is also evident seeing other regions innovating and changing the meta, while NA just copies it. There isn't anything really original coming from NA.



So, with these factors still existing do we think LoL can become mainstream in NA like it is in Asian countries? ",,False,,t5_2wenn,False,,Rumble,True,t3_1ah9b3,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1ah9b3/lets_talk_league_of_legends_as_an_esport_in_north/,

It needs to change.,22,24,99,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1a5n9s/the_rune_page_system_is_a_dishonest_way_of/,"It's an extremely ham-fisted way of compelling players to spend money on indirect power. It's not so much about the stats that you get from runes as it is about the delivery mechanism.  I don't understand why they don't just let us edit them and use the runes *that we've earned* when we want to use them.  

It also punishes players who want to try new things, because with only 2 pages they can't possibly have enough options to deal with the ridiculous number of possible enemy combinations that they may face.  Because of that restriction, it's not worth it to attempt something new because if something gets picked against you that your new page isn't good against, you're screwed.  There isn't any other choice you have.  You might even own the runes that would help you out against that opponent, but you can't use them because you didn't want to spend $20 **to use the runes you already own.**

It's not fun, it's anti-competitive, and it's a very dishonest way of monetizing the game.  It needs to change and it needs to change yesterday.  It's a ridiculous problem and I don't think we should let up on Riot until they do the right thing.  

Personally, I've spent money on pages.  I didn't like doing it but I saw it for what it was: an advantage over many of my opponents.  I don't think that's very healthy for a competitive game.  I feel like the champions themselves aren't necessarily as large a problem since they rely on player skill, whereas runes are direct stat increases.  I don't really feel runes are the issue either, but that being forced to spend either time or money to use them is extremely unfair to everyone.  Considering how the pages are priced it's ridiculous to expect people to invest that much time or money into something that isn't in any way fun.  

It's far more satisfying as a player to acquire new characters or runes that buff my existing characters because there is a tangible affect.  That isn't the case with the pages, it's just an advantage for the person who has more of them with absolutely no gameplay cost.

I've been meaning to make one of these posts for quite some time now, though I never really got to it. But with the latest patches, I think the need for such a post has grown immensely.




But before we start I want to make a few things clear :

*1. I am not a native english speaker so do not expect me to have perfect grammar.

*2. I am not a professional player. I am just a random high elo nobody. I didn't write this to quote someone else, but to share my thoughts about the game. It is up to you to decide if you agree with me or not.

*3. This is my first ever post (blog?) of this kind and I am pretty bad at formatting with reddit.






Lets begin then. Season 3 patch was huge and mind-blowing. Riot changed so much in one patch, you might as well call it a new game, and it pretty much is a whole new game. So in this post I want to share my thoughts about the state of the game and what the S3 patch ( and patches after ) accomplished. Firstly I would like you to change the way you look at the 5 roles in the game and look at them this way :

*Top = Carry

*APC = Carry

*ADC = Carry

*Jungler = Gold Support

*Support = Goldless Support

This might not make sense to you now but I will get to it later.





**The AD Carry**


During Season 2 AD carries were on top of the food chain. They reigned supreme over everyone and decided the outcomes of most games. They were literally Gods.

The reason for this was their item build. There was only 1. The the Pentagon Of Power, or more commonly known as BT/IE/PD/LW/GA. AD carries never had to think, they just had to grind. The faster they could farm up their Holy Grail, the sooner they would beat the crap out of everyone else. There was nothing really interesting or fun about ADs. It was the same thing over and over again on each one. It didn't matter who you would play, since you would do the exact same thing. So what made them fun? Well the Pentagon Of Power sure did. How could it not be? You were able to kill anything and everything that stood infront of you. Why should you try to kite the enemy renekton when you can survive his burst and then sustain the rest of his dmg with your lifesteal. 


But the Season 3 patch came and changed everything. Most importantly it hit the Pentagon Of Power ( PoP?) and it hit it hard. Every single item in it was nerfed. So that solved one of the problems with ADs. They were no longer the Gods they were in S2, but if you are no longer a god how are you fun to play? Well Riot gave an answer to that as well. The gave us a whole bunch of new options for the AD to buy, such as BOTRK , Statik Shiv, Black Cleaver (face it old one was never worth anything), Hurricane, Zephyr and so on. While some of the weren't really successful (e.g. Hurricane) others became viable items with clear advantages and disadvantages (e.g. Statik Shiv). With this many new items in the game ADs now have a contender on their pentagon for every item except IE, and their second problem is also somewhat solved.




**AP Carries**


APs also received a bag of changes, though not as much as ADs it is still something! The overall cost and slot efficiency of RoA, AA and Morellonomicon got increased while the cost and slot efficiency of Deathcap and Athenes demi-godly grail got decreased. As a result we have seen RoA and AA gain some popularity.

But with the latest patches it looks like Riot are trying to revert this. They buffed Athene's, Dcap and Zonya, which were already a must have item for every mana caster. So the goals that the S3 patch tried to achieve are now being thrown out of the window? 

Well not everything is bad in the new patch. The introduction of Seeker's Armguard was a really good move. Everyone has acknowledged the fact that we needed an ap/armor item that could be easily obtainable, but did it have to end in a buff to Zonya's Hourglass?

So why would you buff the already best items? It's bad enough that we have to buy Voidstaff every single game, but if we have to buy 3 or 4 exact same items in every game to not feel like shit, then aren't we regressing back to what ADs were in S2? Think about it. Now question yourself: Why do I have to buy voidstaff every single game?The answer to this question lies in the hands of the bruisers.




**Bruisers - Top Lane Carry, Gold Support and Goldless Support** 


The reason why I am putting these 3 together is because there is not much to say about the supports. Generally the bottom lane support (or Goldless Support) builds cheap and cost effective items(e.g. Locket, Crucible) while the jungler (or the Gold Support ) builds more expensive and slot effective items (e.g. Bulwark, Omen, Frozen Heart). Both of them aim to aid their carries with whatever they can - CC, shields, heals etc.

So yeah there isn't much to say about supports so lets move on to the Top Carry. This is where it becomes tricky. The majority of champions played top lane are bruisers who can play both as dmg dealers and tanks. Thus they have a huge item pool to choose from... or so we think atleast.




**Force of Nature**


When Season 3 came an item called Force of Nature (a.k.a. FoN) was removed from the game. There were numerous of reasons for this, but the main problem was that the item was overpowered as hell. If you have forgotten the stats it gave or weren't playing during that time here they are:

*+40 health regeneration per 5
*+76 magic resistance
*+8% movement speed

UNIQUE PASSIVE: You gain health regeneration equal to 1.75% of your maximum health. 


For those of you who don't know how and why it was broken on some top laners I will explain.

1. If you add up the flat and % health regen you average top laner would end up with 70-100 hp/5. How are you supposed to win a lane against someone who regens anywhere from 840 to 1200 hp per minute? It was just not possible. Buying FoN in lane basically made you AP Tryndamere.

2. It gave MS. This is probably the most underrated stat for top lane, but it plays a huge role in that lane. Having that extra 8% ms means you have 20-30 more movement speed than your opponent and having that much makes it much easier for you to engage and disengage him. In fact you could engage and disengage him whenver you wanted to. Not to mention it also helped escape ganks.

3. Magic Resist and Movement Speed crushed the jungler and the mid laner. Since ad mids were unheard of and outside of lee and noc every jungler was mostly magic dmg, they literally couldn't do anything to stop you. There was no counterplay except to force their top laner to buy a FoN as well.


But here is the catch. The champions who could abuse FoN had high base dmg and didn't really need to build more. You couldn't buy FoN on Riven or Irelia and except to be as useful as Olaf with a FoN. Your champion just did not have the kit for it. So you lost the game before it had even started. Seems fair?




**Bulwark**


Imagine this scenario: You are playing top lane and your jungler has a Bulwark, but you need more MR because the enemy has 2 APs and Varus. The MR you have from your runes and masteries simply isn't enough to stop the huge amounts of magic dmg coming from these three. 

So what do you do ? Ughm.... you buy.... a spi.... ANOTHER BULWARK. Why? Why not? You are the Top Laner. You don't care about cost efficiency since you have hundreds of minions killed. You only care about slot efficiency and if you were to compare it to every other end-tier MR item, Bulwark simply beats them all by....a LOT. Yet it''s an aura. See the problem?




**AURA ITEMS SHOULD NOT BE SLOT EFFECTIVE FOR THE BUYER**


The whole reason to have aura items is to have something that helps th team. You give up on stats so everyone on your team can have them. You give up on 30 MR so everyone else on the team can have it. See where I am going? Aura items should never be cost/slot effective for the bearer. You buy aura items so that the overral strenght of the team grows more, not for your own personal good. You buy them so that you can have 80% of what you paid for while the team can have 20% of what you paid for per person. You don't buy an aura so that you get 100% of what you paid for AND the rest of your team - 20% per person. Well you do, because it is overpowered and you play this game to win.

The worst part is that those auras have different buffs for the one who is carrying it. This way you get to have the same aura TWICE.

Bottom line is while Bulwark can't be abused the same way you could abuse FoN, but it is in no way less toxic to the game than FoN.




Well this is most of what I have to say about the game right now. You can decide for yourself what my word is worth.

Karthus - Presents little counterplay in lane, will always be a much stronger competitive pick than he is in solo queue.  

Kha'Zix - Leaves no reason to play any other AD assassin. Rework would not do his theme justice.  

Master Yi - See Fiora.  

Miss Fortune - Little counterplay, very binary approach to laning, toxic when viewed in terms of the other ADCs because she allows less skilled players to cheese lane and mid-game victories.  

Quinn - Useless ultimate, theme makes almost no sense without it however. Could return as some kind of falconer designed as an AD caster.  

Rengar - Kit overload. Offensive steroids, defensive steroids, heals, invisibility, movement speed buff, CC.   

Sona - Almost no downside to picking her.

Soraka - Removes the incentive for active play in bot lane. Will miss the archetpye, but strong healers have to go.  

Thresh - Either new champions get lots of displacement abilities like the lantern, and the old guard of champions are rendered useless by power creep, or they don't and Thresh is a constantly OP pick. Has no right getting all his free tankiness combined with that CC.  

Tryndamere - See Fiora. Also no fun for low skill players to play against.  

Urgot - Not fun to support for or lane against. Lots of hidden power (ie the damage reduction) but only one big flashy ability, not especially fun to play as relative to power level.

Zac - What a stupid champion. Free guardian angel, % damage, lots of CC, a ludicrously large gap closer. Should never have made it out the door. Balance will always rest on a knife edge.

Honourable Mentions

Ezreal - Needs the blink taken away or given a more appropriate cooldown. Compare to abilities like Satchel Charge.  

Graves - Smokescreen has to go.  

Katarina - Needs mana. [Not 100% sure on this one, just inherently distrustful of cooldown limited champions, especially those with resets.]  

Poppy - Comprehensive rework necessary. Could stay true enough to character to remain in the game afterwards.  

Shen - Bored of seeing this guy competitively. Leads to incredibly passive drawn out games.  

Sion - Comprehensive rework necessary.  

Teemo - Verges on unbeatable in lane, incredibly obnoxious and taxing to play against. The enjoyment playing him gives someone is not worth the grief of the enemy laner and eventually his team when they have to send two people to catch him whilst splitpushing. When your goal as a champion is for your team not to teamfight all game before the final nexus push, something is wrong. Needs fixing, no idea how.  

Twisted Fate - Seems unable to be balanced for both low levels of play and OGN. Perhaps needs to be converted to AD.  

Vi - Defensive steroid, offensive steroid, % damage, auto-attack reset, un cc-able gap closing CC. Really obnoxious but balanceable.  

Yorick - Not sure on this one. Seems very tricky to balance, un-fun to play against, and will always be strongest at mid-tier levels of play. Maybe more trouble than he's worth.

I'm happy to debate my choices. Don't know if Scarra still lurks here, would love to hear his opinion. I think Aatrox will belong on this list.",,False,,t5_2wenn,1370747032.0,,Nami,True,t3_1fyicp,http://www.reddit.com/r/summoners/comments/1fyicp/if_you_were_tasked_with_designing_lol2_which/,
