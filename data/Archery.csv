 I love archery. I love people who love archery. I love that the sport is getting more popular, especially after so many movies, games and tv shows have featured it.

Archery is a great sport.

If your kids want to learn archery, fantastic! But going into a sporting goods store and buying a bow and arrows and taking them out to an unsupervised range is NOT the same as buying a basketball and taking them to a community court. PLEASE realize that archery is a sport that involves WEAPONS.

If *you* don't know archery, take them to someone who does. They need at the very least, a basic safety and introductory lesson. It might not hurt if you paid attention as well.

I'm not yelling at your kids becaue I'm mean. I'm yelling at your kids because they're running behind the targets while other archers are firing. Sure, we're going to stop shooting when your kid dashes out into the field to find their missing arrow, and I know I'm accurate enough that I won't hit them, but *you* don't know that.

No, that compound shooter two targets over isn't staring at your family because you're cute. He's staring at your family in disbelief that you would let your toddler pick buttercups in front of a firing line and trusting that your other kids and the other archers won't hit her.

I don't carry around spare nock points, and pliars to install them on your kids' bows and give impromptu lessons because I'm nice. I'm doing it because someone here needs to be the responsible adult. 

You have abdicated your duties as a responsible parent and handed your child a weapon with no knowledge or instructions on how to use it. I'm picking up the slack.

Stop. Take a moment. Think about what you're doing and what you're allowing your children to do. For goodness sake, just have a little common sense!

A concerned archer.

PS- Put a leash on your dog and don't let it poop in the field.

PPS- On second thought, just don't bring your dog.

*EDIT- Parents, if I get upset because your kids are doing something stupid and unsafe, I'm not upset with them; I'm upset with you. If I tell you nicely once and you let your kids do it again, or want to ignore my instructions, just get off the range and don't come back. Ignorance we can fix, but stupid isn't welcome. (thanks /u/thinkindude)",,False,self,t5_2r256,1366709145.0,,,True,t3_1cuusj,http://www.reddit.com/r/Archery/comments/1cuusj/any_way_to_tack_a_psa_onto_the_dvd_release_of/,

1. Be sure that the arm is not fully locked out so the elbow is not pertruding. Its easy enough saying this but some good ways on how to do it:
 - start with the arm slightly bent before drawing and maintain a solid forward 'press' towards the target.
 - be sure that the bow shoulder isn't riding up, try and keep it a low as physically possible from start to finish.

2. Be sure you are not over pushing with your front arm. A good way to know if you are is if your arrows constant fly left (right handed archer)

3. Remember to follow through with your shot, the string hand should end up around your neck/ ear area. This will prevent any excess string flicking.

4. Bring you head (and thus your anchor) slightly infront of the chest.

5. Open the stances out slightly, we're only talking half a step.

6. Make sure you bow is set up properly. Twisted limbs or riser could be a factor.

Most importantly, if you are still unsure... find a coach, its what they are there for. I'm sure 99% will quite happily give advice if someone asks.

I'm sure theres a load of other this I've missed but they're the main ones I can think of.

so the other day i took my compound bow to a bow shop because i had to have the string replaced. After they put the new string on, they did some other tweaking and adjusting of my bow. apparently the rest was off a bit, so they fixed that. I gave them my old peep sight and asked if they would use that. When i picked up my bow, the new string had a different peep sight in it, which i was charged for, (they also didn't serve it) and i never got my old one back. I eventually took out the new one, put a different one in and remembered to serve it.

While i was at the shop, i was constantly being given the typical bow shop/gun store bravado. Way too much testosterone and too many guys dying to prove their 'superior' knowledge every chance they could. ""this was set up wrong"" ""that was way off"" ""i had to readjust this because it was wrong"" ""i dont know how you could be accurate with this"" blah, blah, blah.... basically the entire visit could have been summarized with one sentence; ""everything on your bow is set up different than my bow, so i took the liberty of setting it up the way *I* shoot""

ive been shooting for 10 years. I tune my bow so that it shoots where i aim my pins, my arrows don't fish tail or porpoise, and i shoot every day, its what i love to do. I know im accurate as hell with my bow, and after i got it back home to shoot, i had to re tune everything and get it back to how i had it before.

1347930626.0,29,self.Archery,101yqz,3 exercises to make shooting less tiring,34,5,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/Archery/comments/101yqz/3_exercises_to_make_shooting_less_tiring/,"Fellow archers, if you were like me, you started to feel tired after 100 or so shots.  Over the past 5 years, I have been doing these 3 exercises and am able to shoot 300 arrows no problem.  I though I would share with you my secret.

Before I begin, let me issue a warning.  These are exercises to be done given you are using the correct muscles.  I shoot using a method called the NTS, or the National Training System by Kisik Lee.  In a nutshell, you use your bone alignment and back muscles to support the weight of the bow rather than your bicep/shoulder/any other part of your body.  Doing otherwise may cause injuries, and I am not to be held responsible.

To start off, stretch out your muscles.  Arm stretches, neck stretches, back stretches, core stretches, etc.  You never want to get into shooting with muscles that are tense.

The first exercise, called SPT 1, or Specific Physical Training #1, is a drill for Endurance.  Proceed though your shot until you get to transfer(or anchor if you don't use the NTS), and hold it there for 30 seconds.  Then let down and rest for twice the time you held.  Do 5 of these, then rest for 5 minutes, and do another set.  This will build your endurance, but takes a while to complete.  If you can't hold for 30, do 25, or 20, or even 15.  Do what you can do without injuring yourself, and add 5 seconds every week.

The next exercise is called SPT 2, the drill for Power.  Go through your shot as you normally would, and once you get to holding, go back down to set-up, and go straight back to holding.  Essentially what you are doing is drawing the bow, letting down, drawing the bow, letting down.  Do this 10 times, rest for 30 seconds, 10 more, rest, 10 more, rest, and so on.  3-5 in a set, rest for 5 in between.

The final one is called SPT 3, and it is for flexibility.  As always, go through your shot like you would normally do, and draw though your clicker by expanding, but don't shoot.  Expand through your clicker for 10 seconds, or expand for 10 seconds if you don't have a clicker, then let down.  Rest for 30, and do it again. 5 or 6 to a set, you decide how many sets.  I recommend at least 3.

If you do these 4-6 days a week, you will notice an increase in stability in your shot, and most likely an increase in scores/accuracy.  Remember, do what you can without injuring yourself.  The idea of these is to work the muscle, not to kill yourself.

Good luck with your training, post any thoughts in the comments!

Most of them allow you to upgrade your limbs to more pounds later on, so it really is the ideal starter bow.  I believe that Hoyt owns this company, and that Easton owns Hoyt, but my only source is the internet so I could be wrong.
[Most of them start at around $89.](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;ion=1#q=fuse+focus+recurve&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;prmd=imvns&amp;source=univ&amp;tbm=shop&amp;tbo=u&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7yndT_GVI4ys8ATZ3MXyCg&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CGcQrQQ&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf.,cf.osb&amp;fp=3e2c363e3ac37794&amp;ion=1&amp;biw=1536&amp;bih=824)


I haven't tried the Intrepid bow, as it was out of my price range.  It looks pretty cool though.


As others have mentioned in this thread, the [Samick Sage](http://samicksports.com/h_sage.html) offers a cheaper alternative to the Intrepid at ~$130.  I'm not familiar with it, but it looks pretty neat, offering weights from 25# to 60#.

An excellent arrow for the basic Fuse Focus are the inexpensive aluminium Easton XX75.  You can usually get a dozen with field tips and fletching for about $90.  I got mine from a locally owned archery store.  If you don't have a shop nearby dedicated to archery, you can usually get started at a Hunting supply store.  Just make sure to ask for the guy that actually knows about archery and not just some doofus.


Now that you've got a bow and arrows, you'll need something to shoot at in your backyard.  I recommend something like [this](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;ion=1#hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;tbm=shop&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;q=bone+collector+target+super+duper+-cover&amp;oq=bone+collector+target+super+duper+-cover&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;gs_l=serp.3...9000.10538.1.10681.7.7.0.0.0.0.96.333.7.7.0...0.0.9QWXQDntqnU&amp;pbx=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf.,cf.osb&amp;fp=3e2c363e3ac37794&amp;ion=1&amp;biw=1536&amp;bih=824).  It's what I have and I just leave it outside, and maybe remember to cover it up with the tarp I have hanging over the chain link fence behind it if it looks like rain.  It's stuffed with recycled plastic shopping bags, so you could DIY it possibly.

Alternative DIY targets are often made out of old carpet, old futons, or cardboard boxes stuffed with plastic shopping bags.


I recommend taking one or two classes to get your form right at the beginning.  You can then perfect it in your backyard in your leisure time.


I personally prefer instinctive archery, as it's the most natural.  If you've ever thrown a ball or a rock, you did it instinctively.  You didn't have a sight and the more you practiced, the better your aim got.  You looked at the target, threw it, and watched how the ball flew.  Instinctive archery is the same thing, except you use less effort since the bow does most of the work for you.


I hope this helpful to somebody.  If I can answer any questions, or if anybody has an alternative view I'd love to hear it!  I'd also love to hear from people who use the gap aiming method or sights as to why they prefer that.",,False,self,t5_2r256,1339908800.0,,,True,t3_v5t54,http://www.reddit.com/r/Archery/comments/v5t54/want_to_get_into_archery_and_looking_for_a_good/,

So how about we add a nice shiny button to the side bar that links to [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Archery/search?q=%22Beginner%22+&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance) for them? Saying something along the lines of ""Beginner? Over here!"" or something.

It'd just be a faster way for beginners to get hold of the information as they can have a quick skim through previous posts and it'd reduce their dominance on the front page. However I get it if most of you might like the feeling of passing down knowledge to beginners first hand, so feel free to shoot this idea down (pun intended).

1374161996.0,25,self.Archery,1ikbxk,Total newbie here. What kind of costs would I be looking at if I got into target shooting? Where should I start?,26,1,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/Archery/comments/1ikbxk/total_newbie_here_what_kind_of_costs_would_i_be/,"Hi all.  I've been interested in archery all my life but never had the funds or time to get involved with it.  I know I should probably start at a club, but near as I can tell, there aren't any nearby (it's all bowhunting here), so some resources on proper technique and the like would be nice.  One of the local archery shops near me does offer 2 hours of free safety instruction with the purchase of a new bow, so there's that.  They also have an indoor range for 10 dollars an hour and they'll offer shooting advice while you're there, but that looks like it's about all I'll get in terms of instruction.  I'll probably end up buying some targets and going up to my grandmother's farm in the long run.



Would also like to know more about the less concrete costs involved in archery.  Like obviously there's the price of the bow, but about what should I be spending on arrows?  How many will someone generally burn through?  How often will I need to replace the string and other maintenance costs?  How long will a target last?  What all equipment do I need besides the obvious?  Or any other ""hidden"" cost that I'm missing.  

Edit: Forgot to mention that I was planning on shooting recurve, but would be open to be swayed if something else would be ""better"" for a beginner.

This is basically just a discussion post, I guess. I know many trad shooters just point shooting or gap shooting, so I guess this is mainly for instinctive shooting. Now, I've been instinctive shooting traditional bows my whole life. I think the first, last, and only time I ever touched a compound was when I was maybe 5 or 6. 

Anyways, when I shoot, I don't even see my bow or my arrow. I hyperfocus on my target and let my arms and subconsciousness do the work. But what I do see is the arc of the arrow. Like instead of using the arrow as a reference point for my aiming, it's almost as if I can see a red streaming arc(like this http://www.ziplineinteractive.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/red_arc_music_logo.png) from me to my target, and that's how I shoot. But I don't see the arc because of a sight picture or anything. I can hold my arms as if I'm shooting my bow and see the arc of the imaginary arrow perfectly. I dunno, I guess it's because I've shot so many arrows in my life.

So my question is, does anyone else shoot like this? Just curious. I know most trad shooters either point shoot, gap shoot, or instinctive, but even most instinctive still use their sight picture as a reference. But I'm talking about just from the feeling in your hands and arms, being able to perfectly see the arc of the arrow hitting the target.

Maybe I was inspired by the so called 'Year of the Bow' in video games (Crysis 3, Tomb Raider, Assassins Creed 3 etc.). Anyhoo, I mentioned this to my dad and he recalled that my granddad was a 'Freeman of Llantrisant', ie: a male bloodline descendant of an esteemed group of Welsh longbow men who fought under Edward the Black Prince and were supposedly pivotal in the fight against the French army in the Battle of Crecy during the Hundred Years War. It was also supposedly the actions of these archers which led to the adoption of the longbow as the standard missile firing weapon of the English Crown for the duration of the Middle Ages in Britain.

I was naturally intrigued about this, so me and my dad spent a weekend confirming both his and my legitimacy to enrollment, which led into a fun foray back into the depths of my family history, (the Welsh side at least). It turns out I am actually the direct descendant of one of the original 12 Freemen who enrolled in 1724 (the year I assume was when they first began compiling a list instead of just organising by word of mouth).

Are there any other Freemen on here? Interested to know and I think I'll definitely be taking up archery now!

Another family came by and was just watching. My 11 year old son hung up his brand new Rally after shooting and was waiting for everyone else to finish, and once I got done I turned around to see this asshole parent had taken it off the hanger and was drawing back on my son's bow! I don't know if I just caught him as he started or if he did it a few times (at his adult draw length, definitely a longer draw length than my son's) but I yelled at the guy ""Hey! Don't touch my son's bow!"" and I had to tell him again and he was like ""No problem no problem""(He is Indian, from India) and he finally put it back. Shortly after, his prick little kid came up and tried picking up my bow off the hanger, and I was like WTF! and said ""Nonono .. don't touch other people's property!"" and he didn't seem to know what that meant(even though he was like 8 and spoke perfect English), so I had to clarify ""Other people's property means anything that doesn't belong to YOU!""

Three questions here:

1. If the guy overdrew my son's bow, could that damage it? I've been told not to let anyone else draw your bow. 

2. Is it just me, or should it be common sense not to touch other people's shit?

3. Has this happened to anyone else?

EDIT: I forgot to mention that this was a public park range, so it's not like a shop or club range. The place is called Turkey Swamp in New Jersey, and they have Excelsior Hay Bails set up at different ranges. Usually there is no one ever there, but today a group came and this annoying father and son were campers just following them in. They got there at the same time as the group and knew who owned the bows since they were watching my son and I shoot.

And here's an [Imgur gallery](http://imgur.com/a/CHIg1#0) of the rest. Lots of comments there, not so much here.

They're all red oak board bows. Wood selection was iffy on the second two, but I was excited. That's one of the things I've learned.

I'm not planning on changing any of them right now, but feel free to comment on the tiller shape (or anything else) if you wish -- if for no other reason than to see if my eyes see what your eyes see. I also think I'll take a little break from building and get to shooting! I haven't done much of that the past few weeks. But I will be making more, that's for sure.

I've been shooting a 52"" recurve for about a year, and I've known for a while that it's simply too short for me to shoot comfortably. Shooting longbows is going to be a welcome change for me, I can already tell. They all feel good on the fingers, and even with poorly matched arrows I'm shooting fairly consistently and accurately.

Getting used to the lower brace height will take some time though. I'm getting some pretty bad wrist slap. I made a simple bracer to cope, and I also ordered some HMPE string material to try out. Not digging huge welts on my wrist, but hopefully I can solve that in time.

I didn't pay them much mind other than keeping an eye on them in my peripheral vision to know when it was safe to retrieve.

Then I started to hear a sound that makes me cringe every time I hear it; the sound of a dry-fire. If it had just been one, I might have ignored it as a ""slip"", but after hearing it multiple times,  I started keeping a closer eye on them.

The bow was obviously too much for one of them to handle since he couldn't get a full draw. His friend would then step in and put his arm *through the string* to push his friend's arm back to a full draw.

I pretended to be curious and ask about their draw weight and how long they've been shooting. The answers were ""Um, either 52 or 62 pounds?"" and ""About ten minutes."" I tried to casually recommend that they not dry-fire their bow because it might damage the limbs, but they just gave me a ""Yeah, whatever little girl."" eye roll and called my recurve ""cute"".

I don't so much care that they were being patronizing, but in all honesty, they scare the living daylights out of me. They're dangerous not only to themselves, but to those around them. The range is in a public park with no one to oversee, so it's a 'shoot at your own risk' kind of place.

I was getting tons of forearm slap, and had a hard time aiming.. then I read this:

[10 Basic Steps to Correct Archery Form](http://www.harrogate-archery.co.uk/basics.html)

and added to that the tip I got that ""Recurves can not be over-drawn"" (I was afraid of over-drawing my pse-razorback since my draw is 30""-31"").

Also, I bought a cheap release tab from ebay.


My shots are now much more enjoyable! 

* thanks to the correct form I no longer get slap at all
* thanks to the correct form it is easier to aim
* thanks to the tab my fingers are not bruised and aching after an hour of shooting

I'm only still in the dark regarding how to gauge arrow drop (shooting at long distances) but i'm guessing that when shooting instinctively it's just a matter of getting more and more (and more) practice.

For some reason it took me way to long to search for a archery subreddit but now that I've found it I'm loving all the info I'm finding. I hadn't shot a bow since YMCA camp way back in the day but on a whim my gf asked if I could carve a bow for her renfest outfit and I've been hooked ever since. These are a few of the bows I've done so far, they're all red oak or hard maple selfbows. Hope you like them!

I've been working on this bow for the past few weekends with the help of an old archer at my current place of employment.

It has red elm risers 
  2 at 0.005""/inch taper (hand made in a tapering rig)
  1 parallel

Babinga grip.

Fiberglass backing.

55 - 60 lbs at 28"".  I have only rough sanded it, though.  It will likely lose 3 lbs or so after final sanding.

I have yet to add my leather handle and felt rest.  I admit I did use a band saw and a grinder for the rough work, but most of this was done just with files and patience. 

I'm just excited and wanted to share.


edit:  I realize the pictures make it look like it has some strange tiller, but that's just the angles with which the pictures was taken.  It has a slight positive tiller and the top limb slightly leads the bottom on a tiller board.

Something I noticed is that everyone I've met is very helpful. the private dealer sat with me for 2 hours digging through hundreds of bows to find me the best one he could in my price range and about 2 more hours helping me shoot and showing me his collection.

The specialty store also sat with me and let me shoot a good amount of their arrows to find my size as well as giving me shooting tips. They even invited me back for free lessons.

These guy's are either really good business men or are the friendliest people I've ever met.

My interest waned during the last decade or so but recently I've been looking for an outdoor hobby to take me away from my desk job and otherwise indoor lifestyle, so naturally I've been looking at getting back into archery. Actually, I've noticed a increased interest in archery and crossbows in all areas of popular culture, with the popularity of [Katniss' character from The Hunger Games](http://www.refinery29.com/hunger-games-katniss) books and movies, the [inclusion of a crossbow in Call of Duty: Black Ops](http://callofduty.wikia.com/wiki/Crossbow), the [box art for the upcoming Crysis 3 videogame](http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showthread.php?t=469848) depicting a cryosuit soldier using a bow and arrow, [Hawkeye's character](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawkeye_%28comics%29) in the [upcoming Avengers movie](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tY9DnBNJFTI), and [Daryl Dixon's use of the crossbow](http://walkingdead.wikia.com/wiki/Daryl_Dixon) in [The Walking Dead TV series](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1520211/), to name a few. As matter of fact, it's The Walking Dead that inspired me to write this post.


I just finished the second season of The Walking Dead (awesome show by the way), and there were several scenes where Daryl Dixon was fashioning replacement bolts for his crossbow out of what appeared to be fresh cut tree branches using a hunting knife. First, this got me wondering if this was even possible or practical IRL, then it got me thinking about bows and crossbows in general and how they would perform in an apocalyptic/survival type scenario where resources are scarce and your very livelihood and survival may depend on them. I'm not the most knowledgeable person where it comes to bows and crossbows, but these are some of the questions and concerns that came to mind for this type of scenario.


Looking at compound bows, recurve bows, longbows and crossbows in each of the following areas:

**Structure / Durability**

* How much punishment can it take via dropping, throwing, hitting and the otherwise general manhandling that may occur through constant use in this scenario?

* Would a modern compound bow made with the latest and greatest materials be more or less susceptible to damage than a wooden recurve or longbow?

* Similarly, what effect will time and age have on it?

* What would be the best/most durable/most reliable material for a bow or crossbow in this scenario?

* Should other factors be considered other than durability such as weight or susceptibility to high/low/varying temperatures?

* All said and done, what would be the best bow or crossbow as far as structure and/or durability is concerned? - *My thoughts: Mechanical simplicity would seem like a big concern, as with more complexity comes a greater opportunity for something to break. I would think a simpler bow like a recurve or longbow would be more reliable in general than a compound bow or crossbow.*

* How difficult would it be to fashion a complete bow or crossbow out of wood or other common materials?

**Making Repairs**

* How easy it is to fashion replacement parts out of easily accessible resources?

* How difficult would it be to make repairs with only common or readily available tools?

**Strings**

* What common materials could be used to maintain the strings?

* Would it be possible to fashion replacement strings using common materials or materials readily found in nature?

* Would it be more difficult to restring a bow or a crossbow using field equipment only?
	
**Ammunition** (arrows/bolts)

* Could you craft replacement arrows or bolts out of tree branches and/or other readily available materials?

* Would this hand-crafted replacement ammunition be as-or-nearly as effective as modern manufactured arrows or bolts?

* Would arrows or bolts have any particular advantages in this respect?
	
**Effectiveness**

* Would a bow or crossbow the more effective for hunting or self-defense?

* In self-defense, would a bow or a crossbow handle better in close-quarters or urban environments? - *My thoughts: It would seem like a crossbow would give you a definite advantage for close-quarters and urban environments where you might not have time to draw the bow. Then again, I would assume the reload time for a crossbow is much slower than for a bow, so it may even itself out.*

* Would there be a significant accuracy difference between high-quality modern ammunition and hand-crafted replacement ammunition fashioned out of wood or other common materials?

* What would be the ideal bow or crossbow for hunting?

* What would be the ideal bow or crossbow for self-defense?

**Unique Advantages**

* Are there any unique advantages that a compound bow, recurve bow, longbow or crossbow would give you over the others in any of the above categories?

* Are there any unique advantages that a bow would give you over a crossbow, or visa versa?

* Are there any unique advantages that a bow or crossbow would have over a traditional firearm? (pistol, revolver, etc.)

First I would like to say that this is definitely my favorite sub here on Reddit. This is a great community of people sharing a common interest and there is never any overly sarcastic comments or trolling. 

Anyway, I wanted to start a discussion about the mental side of archery. We are always talking about types of bows and proper form and technique, but this sport is so mental. Sometime I feel like I will have a bad day after shooting a couple bad ends, and those bad ends come from just one or two bad shots. 

So, with that in mind. How do you prepare yourself mentally to shoot? How are you able to be constructively critical about your technique without being overly judgmental? What techniques can you use to get back into the right frame of mind if you think you are having a bad day?

Also, if anyone is interested, I was given this book ""The Inner game of Tennis"" by W. Timothy Gallwey (which is what prompted me to start this thread). Though it obviously has a tennis medium, it is really good as far as thinking about the mental side of sports.

So I get a text from my brother (and fellow 3D league competitor) asking what I'm doing at 7PM. Turns out that someone he knows was selling a brand new BowTech Destroyer 350 for best offer. My brother quickly offered $300 and the guy immediately said yes. My brother already had a BowTech Destroyer 350. I asked ""Dude... why do you need another BowTech?"" His response ""... I cant have you shooting that youth bow all your life. Its time."" We went and picked it up. It was completely outfitted with everything I'd need. It was so new that the quiver didnt even have dimples in the foam from arrows. Its the Camo version. Not the straight black / red version. 

TL;DR: My brother bought me a brand new BowTech setup for a little bit of nothing without me prompting him at all to do so. Brother of the year.

Based on your advice, I got him a recurve and he absolutely loves it. I watched him shooting against other kids who had been shooting much longer and it was amazing how accurate he became over the course of the week.

He is still working on his form (and probably will be for years), but he likes the fact that he's using a bow that can help him become an Olympic archer, that it looks different than the compounds the other kids are using, and, of course, that it can grow with him (the arms are detachable).

We picked up a cheap one, since there's no point in dropping vast amounts of money on an 8-year-old who's trying something out, but it's nice and fun and it was the right decision.

So thanks /r/archery. My son and I thank you.

Another story, so I went with my friend to a new store that had just opened because she wanted some new equipment. She had already decided that she wanted a Winex with SF Premium limbs. When we got there the person who worked there said that they don't carry much stock and just order equipment to come in periodically. They also said that the SF Premiums take a long time to manufacture and started to persuade my friend to buy Kaya K1 limbs in which they had lots of stock for. 

I started to get suspicious about the way the store was being run. Are they just trying to get rid of old inventory so they can make room for new inventory through selling to unsuspecting newbies?

Thanks to today, I'll be getting myself a horse (traditional recurve bow) in the new year.

Hey everyone,
I got the go ahead from RugerRedhawk, so here goes! I've started an overall outline below, now it's your turn: write out your tips in the comments! All relevant contributions will be added, but remember this is for noobs, so try not to overwhelm your reader. If your contribution makes the cut, I'll be putting in a list of contributors as well. Feel free to copy and paste any advice you wrote from one of the many first bow threads.

[SAFETY FIRST!! Read this.](http://users.ox.ac.uk/~archery/docs/range_safety.pdf)

**1) I want to get into archery - what should I do?**

Find your closest archery club and sign up for a class. Archery is not necessarily the cheapest sport in the world, so you should try out a bow and get good form before you buy your first bow.

**2) Alright, I've been shooting at my local club for a while, now I'm ready for my first bow. What should I get?**

For compound bows, check out this awesome blog post [here](http://www.manualofman.com/2011/how-to-buy-your-first-compound-bow/).

For recurves, you need to figure out your draw weight (see question 3) and your draw length. The easiest way to measure your draw length is to take your natural armspan (don't stretch!) and divide by 2.5, but this isn't always accurate. The best (most accurate) way to get your draw length is to get a friend/coach to physically measure your draw length by marking an arrow at the rest when you're at full draw. Some clubs have rulers printed on long arrows to determine draw lengths.


**3) What should my Draw weight be?**

Always always always always start with a lower draw weight. Period. End of story.

That being said, there are a lot of variables in draw weight. First off, you need to know your draw length (that is, the distance between the arrow rest and your anchor point). The weight on most limbs is determined with a draw length of 28 inches. If your draw length is over 28 inches, you will end up pulling a much higher weight. For example, I have a 30.5 inch draw length and 36 pound limbs, but I end up drawing closer to 42 pounds. Another factor is bow length. If you're shooting with a 62"" bow versus, say, a 68"" bow, the effects are going to be significantly different. The 62"" bow will stack (essentially adding more weight if your draw length is above the designated draw length) much more easily than a 68"" bow would. Also, you'll need a different set of arrows for each set of limbs. Arrows for a 25 pound bow won't be stiff enough for use with the 40 or 60 pound limbs, and arrows for a 60 pound bow will be too stiff for use with 40 or 25 pound limbs.

Once you have all the technical stuff squared away, it really comes down to how long you've been shooting and your fitness level. You may find that you CAN only shoot 3 or 4 arrows with the set of 60 pound limbs, or you might find that you can't even draw the bow back properly with those limbs. And, honestly, if you can't comfortably draw back the bow, you have no business shooting a set of limbs that heavy.

My advice? Get yourself a set of 25-30 pound limbs and really develop a monster form. After that, and only after that, start to think about getting heavier limbs.

*Written by [SonicSemae](http://www.reddit.com/r/Archery/comments/vke5b/draw_weights_when_is_it_just_silly/c55awld)*

**4) What should my arrow length be?**
Draw length + 3/4"". See question 2 for how to figure out your draw length.

**5) Where can I get a good bow from?**
There are lots of places to check out. Your local archery store is probably best because the people there can stop you from making any foolish mistakes. You can also check out several archery forums on the web, as they have pretty active equipment classifieds (e.g. ArcheryTalk). One popular web store is [LancasterArchery.com](LancasterArchery.com)

1. Obviously a bow. I would like to use a recurve since it's the most traditional, but with modern enhancements. (Conveniently, also one of the least expensive.) I'd like to keep it under $200...is there any particular brand or type that I should buy? Is Cabela's a good place to buy from?

2. Arrows. Do I buy all the pieces (shaft, fletching, tips) separately, or can you buy them already assembled? Does ""per [x]"" mean ""this many come in the package,"" as found in [this link](http://www.cabelas.com/product/Hunting/Archery/Arrows-Shafts/Carbon%7C/pc/104791680/c/104693580/sc/104192280/i/103856580/Cabelas-Carbon-Hunter-with-434-AAE-Vanes-150-Per-6/744967.uts?destination=%2Fcatalog%2Fbrowse%2Fhunting-archery-arrows-shafts-carbon%2F_%2FN-1100022%2FNs-CATEGORY_SEQ_103856580%3FWTz_l%3DSBC%253BMMcat104791680%253Bcat104693580%253Bcat104192280&amp;WTz_l=SBC%3BMMcat104791680%3Bcat104693580%3Bcat104192280%3Bcat103856580)? Is there a certain kind of tip you should use for target shooting?

3. Quiver: Any suggestions? I won't be hunting (right away, at least), so does it really matter? Could I just tie a plastic Walmart bag around my hip/back?

4. Anything else? Do I need a fancy release mechanism, or an arm/finger guard, an arrow rest, or anything else? Dumb question: Is there something already on the bow that you can rest an arrow on, or do you have to buy a rest?

(pics inside)",15,3,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/Archery/comments/14x7pc/so_ive_picked_up_my_first_bow_a_used_bowtech_off/,"Skip to the bottom for tl;dr &amp; pics.

I'd like to share a little bit as to why I decided to take up the bow.  

So I went hunting for the first time this year, with a rifle.  I sat in a heated blind with recliners, an iPad, an iPhone, and a Remington 700.  The place that I was at was a beautiful plot of about 50 acres of private land with several deer blinds, none as luxurious as the one I ended up in.  They bait all year round, and had already pulled three deer out of the property this season.

So on the first day out, the very first deer I've had an opportunity to shoot in my life comes wandering in, and begins eating.  I'm no more than 20 yards away, she's broadside to me, giving me a perfect shot and I'm a damn good shot.  I line it up as she stands there eating, none the wiser.  I begin controlling my breathing, calming my adrenaline laced body.  Ten seconds, twenty, thirty, something doesn't feel right.  She's kind of small.  A minute goes by, and I'm just watching her eat through my scope.  Two minutes, a tail twitch, she sniffs the air, looks around, continues breathing. 

Surprisingly my mind isn't racing, I'm extremely focused.  She hasn't really moved much, short of her taking the gun and shooting herself, she couldn't have made it any easier for me to shoot her.  Three minutes... I could have shot her ten times by now but something just doesn't feel right about it.  All this time, I'm trying to put it together in my mind, why does this feel so off?

Then for the briefest moment, my subconscious mind in it's searching, finally wrapped up what I was feeling and put a neat little bow on it for my conscious mind to comprehend.  

La Grunta.

(Relevant:  http://kingofthehill.wikia.com/wiki/Good_Hill_Hunting )

Suddenly I realized that was it.  This felt cheap.  It felt handed to me.  I felt like I was stealing this animal's life, not earning it.  I didn't deserve it.  I am a good shot but I don't yet know how to hunt.  But I knew that this wasn't hunting.  It felt borderline poaching.  

I picked up my rifle, set it back up against the wall and grabbed my camera and recorded her for another 10 minutes while she stood there eating peacefully.  Eventually she left.

I'm not an entirely spiritual person, truth be told, but I there should be more effort put into take another life.  If I were hunting to survive, to get food to feed my family else we go without, I wouldn't care if I killed that thing with a hand grenade.  But that's not where I'm at, and I feel like maybe in this case, I should be playing with a handicap.

The next day I packed up my stuff and went home early (not to mention I'd come down with Bronchitis)  and decided that if I'm going to hunt, it's going to be with a bow.  That was three weeks ago.

Since then I've watched so many videos on archery, I joined /r/archery and I've read many online tutorials on what a bow is, the differences between compound and traditional.  Learned what everything I'm seeing on these compound bows are and what they're all used for.  Bought the book Core Archery by Larry Wise, and begun practicing at the range.

Last week I finally purchased a used BowTech Mighty Mite compound bow and took it to get sized and tuned.  Took it out to the range and sighted it in.  Two days later, these pictures from this afternoon are the result.

If you managed to read all of that, my thanks.  I felt like I had to tell *someone*.

tl;dr - went hunting with a rifle, wasn't for me. just got my first bow, surprised at the early results.

I have noticed that a lot of us FITA Recurve/Olympic Recurve shooters like the Horizon and recommend it to archers interested in recurve.

I have shot the bow, and find it a great bow to own and shoot.  However, I would recommend the SF Forged Plus riser over it any day.  

The SF Riser is $10 more, but you get two key components that are significant improvements over the Horizon.

First of all, the lateral limb adjustment.  In most intermediate/high end bows, this adjustment allows you to move the housing of the limb left and right in order to offset the positioning of the limbs.  This is important because if the working ends of the limbs (the tips) are not in alignment with each other AND the center of the bow (where the arrow sits), you will get forces that are not propelling the arrow forward, but left and right.  This causes the arrow to behave differently and introduces lateral error every shot.  This will cause excessive vibrations and absorb energy that should be going into the arrow.

With the Horizon's system, the lateral limb adjustment allows only you to pivot the base of the limbs (where they make contact with the riser).  This allows only adjustments for limb straightness, but not riser straightness.  Now imagine that the riser is not perfectly straight: in this case you cannot draw a straight line from tip to tip while going through the center of the riser unless you physically move the housing.  This is where the SF Forged Plus riser has the advantage: it allows the housing to slide left and right along the lateral axis.  All of Hoyt's higher end models all allow for this kind of lateral adjustment.  Even Hoyt's older models like the Matrix have this kind of lateral movement instead of a pivot.

Now my second point - the lack of secondary stabilization holes.  This limits the customization that an archer has over his/her equipment.  Without access to the two secondary stabilization holes, the archer is limited to the front stabilizer/vbar for tweaking weight distribution.

These details may seem minor for a beginning or even an intermediate archer, but as the archer progresses, he/she will feel that their equipment will need an overhaul.

TLDR: The SF Forged Plus riser is more upgradeable/customizable, and will last the beginning/intermediate archer longer than the Horizon.   It has more bang for the buck.",,False,self,t5_2r256,False,,,True,t3_xva2j,http://www.reddit.com/r/Archery/comments/xva2j/why_i_would_not_recommend_the_horizon/,

1367321975.0,12,self.Archery,1del2h,"Determining eye dominance, I'm having trouble with this exeptionally easy task.",15,3,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/Archery/comments/1del2h/determining_eye_dominance_im_having_trouble_with/,"So, I'm looking into taking archery lessons this summer and want to eventually buy my own equipment. I've been looking on some forums for used risers and sights, but want to know if I should be using left handed gear or right handed gear. 

When I was a kid, I used to be left handed, but the nuns at my school forced me to change and become right handed. For the most part, I'm right handed, though I can do just about any task left handed as well. 

The first test I did for eye dominance, I made a circle with my thumb and index finger on my right hand, placed a far away, small object in the middle of it, and then closed each eye one at a time and found myself to be left eye dominant. For that reason, I figured I should shoot left handed. 

Then, because I'm too curious for my own good, I tried doing the same thing with my left hand and found that I was right eye dominant. Damnit.

So then I thought, maybe I should see if there are any other tests, maybe one that is more symmetrical in nature, so I found this test:

1.  Extend your arms in front of you with your palms facing away.

2. Bring your hands together, forming a small hole by crossing the thumbs and fore fingers.

3.  Choose a small object about 15-20 feet away from you. With both eyes open, focus on the object as you look through the small hole.

4.  Close one eye and then the other. When you close one eye, the object will be stationary. When you close the other eye, the object should disappear from the hole or jump to one side.

5.  If the object does not move when you cover one eye, then that eye is dominant. The eye that sees the object and does not move is the dominant eye.

Here's the problem I'm having, and I'm not sure if this is typical or not. If my left hand is on top of my right hand, I'm right eye dominant. If my right hand is on top of my left hand I'm left eye dominant.

What the hell? Is this normal? Do other people have this same issue? Since using a bow will be a new skill to me, I don't think it will be a big difference if I start left handed or right handed, but I'd like to not have the issue with eye dominance and target alignment.

I'm also wondering if used, left handed gear goes a bit cheaper than used, right handed gear, because of the lesser demand for it. Maybe not since the supply is probably less too? I dunno?

Is there anything I can do to resolve this wonky eye dominance thing? Is it even a thing? Wear an eye patch like a pirate? Electroshock therapy? Secret voodoo ceremonies? Haaaalp!


TL;DR Eye dominance test right handed = left eye dominant
          Eye dominance test left handed = right eye dominant
          How in the hell?

EDIT: I found out that I may be part of the population that has no eye dominance. I didn't even know that this was a thing until today. I've found different articles on the internet that claim anywhere between 1% and 15% of the population have no eye dominance.",,False,self,t5_2r256,1367331439.0,,,True,t3_1del2h,http://www.reddit.com/r/Archery/comments/1del2h/determining_eye_dominance_im_having_trouble_with/,

I've been reading about the hobby more, and have talked a bit with sales people at a local archery shop/range that just opened in the area. I'd like your help in getting started.

What I know so far and my related questions:

* I want to go au natural and start with something not compound. Something just seems more appealing about a simple bow. I see that longbows are different than recurve bows, with the former usually used for recreations. I'm leaning toward recurve. Any reasons I shouldn't?

* Any specific models I should consider to get started? I'm not rich, but I can manage $2-300. What kind of arrows?

* The archery store I mentioned earlier seems to be the only range in the area. I'd like to practice there (and they offer lessons), but am ~~I rude if I show up with a bow I didn't purchase there?~~ I'm pretty sure I'll buy there now. Saving $10 to buy online isn't worth it and they've been great.

* What alternatives can I arrange to practice? The range is a bit of a drive, but I live in an apartment. Any ideas on where to set up that I'm not thinking of?

* In case this matters to the equipment you'll recommend, I won't be hunting with this gear. Assuming the hobby takes, however, I won't rule out joining a club or competition shooting.

Thanks for your help and advice! 

UPDATE: I took another trip out to the local store/range today and they happily let me try a few bows and talked me through some basics. I shot a really basic black deal with only a 15# draw for 10-15 shots. I felt like it was really easy to draw, so the owner (super awesome nice guy) had me try a PSE Razorback 62"" with a 25# draw. I feel like it was just about right, but wonder if I should start with something heavier? It felt nice to hold, but I seemed to do worse than I had with the lighter bow. Then again, my arms were not used to this, so I'm sure running another 10-15 shots was going to be harder than when I started. According to the catalog, I can get the Razorback in 20, 25, 30, and 35# draws. 

Also, any general suggestions about anything you nice people think of for a noob would be welcome. 

UPDATE 2: How much attention should I pay to length? I'm 6' even, and a lot of mnufacturers seem to think I should do at least 64/66"".

Sorry for the lack of update guys, but last week our camera died before we even got to the range and this week has been a little busy with work and money problems. But here it is! You may want to look through the [photo album](http://imgur.com/a/UtBPu#0) first just so you get an idea of what I’m talking about. (Maybe I should just make a blog for this?) Also, [here is a video of someone shooting](http://youtu.be/p9gd1G5hwGo).

First off, there is something that I’ve noticed a difference in teaching KTA and western archery back in the states. In Western archery (at least in my experience) you’re coached a little and then you just start shooting and practicing. KTA is more of a martial art and if you’ve taken martial arts before, skills are built upon very slowly. With that said, after two weeks of going to the range, my wife and I have yet to shoot a single arrow. We were given 22# and 27# bows and were told that we would be training for at least one month before we ever got to shoot an arrow. And it makes sense why. The bows they normally shoot with are at least 45-50#s. No way we can pull that on day one and even if you had experience with western archery, the draw is completely different.

**The Draw:** The bow is short, maybe two feet in length. (I’m terrible at judging length so don’t quote me on this.) So when its pulled back to draw it the bow really bends backwards. From my knowledge of how recurves work, the more you pull, the more the poundage builds on itself, and seeing how far we pull back, it is difficult to hold the draw. The draw itself doesn’t stop in front of your face, but past your ear almost to your shoulder. Not only that but your bow arm is pushed straight out. If you had  a normal recurve and you shot with this bow arm, you’d have welts on your forearm. (Though I’ve seen how people release, because I have no experience with it myself, I’m hesitant to talk about it.) In western archery, the anchor is set on your chin and lips. However, KTA has you anchor on your pectoral and the side of your head. I actually have a small sore spot on my man boob where the string has been anchoring.

**TL;DR:** The draw comes all the way back past the ear. The anchor is set on the pectoral and side of your head.

**The Targets:** It may be difficult to judge the distance to the targets in the pictures, but I really have no idea how far away they are. (Maybe a little less than 100 yards?) In any case, they are very big. At least 10 feet tall and 7 feet wide. (When we’re allowed to go out there, we’ll take proper pictures to show size.) In the center of the target there is a large red circle. This circle is mic’ed from what I can tell because every time a shooter hits a target, the speakers from where the shooters are shooting from clang. It is a definite somewhat metallic clank because when the arrow hits any other part of the target, it’s a soft clunk.

The distance from where shooters shoot to the target is probably the reason why we’re training on bows for a month. There are no close targets. When we’re ready to shoot, we’re going to be shooting at those 100 yd targets. We have a 사범님 or a master and because we can’t speak Korean very well, he pantomimed what would happen if we tried to shoot with the current bows we had. It wasn’t a pantomime of hitting a target, that’s for sure. 

**TL;DR:** The targets are big and at least 100 yds away.

**The Thumb Ring:** Just recently, we were asked to come in very early in the morning to get our thumbs sized. After a 6 o’clock wake up and an hour and a half train ride, we meet the master who makes the thumb rings. Makes. Out of wood. My wife and I were pretty amazed. After they were fitted, we were given the thumb ring (after a 60,000 won deposit for the both of us) and given sand paper. A little confused at first, we were told in broken English that we would need to make the thumb rings smooth. 

The feeling I had when we were told to make our thumb rings smooth was… for a lack of a better term was awe. Literal awe. Amazed that I was going to put my own work into something I was going to use. Frightened that I was going to fuck it up. (I’m sure if you’ve made your own arrows, you know the feeling!)

**TL;DR:** We get to smooth our own thumb rings after they were fitted. So awesome!

Well, that’s it for this first update. If you have any questions please ask them and I’ll answer them to the best of my ability. Thank you for being patient and I’ll update again when there is more development to our training. 

Keep shooting r/archery!

- I am a strong, tall, 25 year old man, and I'm curious what weight of bow I should get. The sage comes in 30#-60# it looks like. Obviously preference plays into it, but as a general rule, where should I be?

-Other than the bow, what other accessories should I buy to start out with? 

-What type of arrows should I be looking into?

-Where I live there is next to nothing in local support for archery, so are there any good online resources for starting out that you would recommend?

I grabbed one of their longbows and shot a few. You can say I was hooked, the missus said she can see it plainly in my face. 

So here are my questions:

* What are the main differences in shooting a recurve vs longbow? What specific things do you look for in a longbow? My experience has only been with light olympic recurves.

* Is there a certain brand and model that is recommended to start with?
