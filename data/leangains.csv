* Eat good things, mostly meat (and stop agonizing about macros)
* Lift heavy things and put them down again.  Repeat.

[NSFW]",276,26,99,http://www.reddit.com/r/leangains/comments/1gb1j6/a_few_months_progress_because_i_dont_see_enough/,"Hi fellow LG'ers. Just wanted to share some progress because I don't see enough progress pictures in general in this sub, especially not from females. My fitness journey is far from complete, but I feel like leangains has helped me make some headway and it's great.

**Stats:**
23 year old, 5'8"" female, 156 lbs, never measured BF% accurately

**Routine:**
I started SL 5x5 in March and have pretty much continued with that up until now 3x a week. Though recently I have been incorporating some Madcow in to help break through my squat plateau. I do a good amount of accessory work as well like weighted hanging leg raises, lat pulldowns, bulgarian split squat, planks, etc. I also usually run a 5k or do tabata sprints 2x a week. Aaaand I'm heavily addicted to rock climbing.


**Lift stats progress since March:**

Squat 65lbs -&gt; 150lbs 5RM

Deadlift 45lbs -&gt; 195lbs 5RM

Bench 45lbs -&gt; 100lbs 5RM

And I can do like 5 pull-ups in a row ha..woo.


**Diet:** I did keto from October 2012 to early May 2013. It was cool, I lost like 10lbs or so. Then in May I switched over to LG and haven't looked back! I usually keep calories between 1300-1700 a day, but I don't count on the weekends sometimes and I drink sometimes, so there's that. This week I've been super strict to &lt;1400 calories and it's helped me get definition and drop 2.5 lbs. I find that calories matter more for my progress than macro cycle, but I still do cycle fats and carbs on rest/workout days.

Here are a couple pictures from my journey:

I'm pretty happy with my progress (most days) but I still have a while to go. My lower back is definitely my problem area but I know that will be the last to go. Anyway, that's all I have. Let me know if you have any questions and I hope I can motivate more females to try LG!

First, I'd like to thank Tkon for making his progress post on this subreddit (or did I see it on r/fitness?) a few months ago; it's the entire reason I started leangains and partly why I'm making this post.

Though this is my first post in r/leangains (and on reddit), I've lurked here for a while, so thank you to everyone who has posted here with helpful information.

I've been on a -20/+20 recomp since July and only recently switched to a -20/+30 bulk, so most of the progress from the album was from a recomp. RPT the whole way.

Some things I find to be noteworthy:

-I counted calories pretty meticulously for a few weeks or so when I started, but after that I mostly eyeballed food and estimated. I tried to get around 2200 calories on workout days and 1500 on rest days, +- 50-100. I still weigh food I'm not really sure about (unless I'm outside).

-I kept protein to about .82 g/lb bodyweight. I replaced the missing protein (according to ifcalc) with carbs.

-I didn't really worry about macros that much; I made sure I was eating enough protein and then just focused on eating a lot more carbs on workout days and a lot more fats on rest days. I didn't worry about hitting 300g carbs/70g fat/etc (though I was pretty close to those targets on most days)

-I eat 2 meals a day on most days, sometimes 1 on rest days. I consume ~60% of my calories post workout.

-I have a sweet tooth and eat a lot of snacks - cookies, cupcakes, piroulines, CHEESECAKE, etc.

-I made sure I ate a lot of vegetables and drank a lot of water every day (~128 oz). I recently started eating more fruits, but didn't really eat much for the first 4 months.

-Workout routine: 

 Tuesday - Squat (RPT), OHP (RPT), Accessory (Usually Inclined DB Press, BW Chinups)

 Thursday - Bench (RPT), Goblet Squats or Turkish Getups (Not RPT), Weighted Dips (RPT)

 Saturday - Deadlift (RPT), Weighted Chins (RPT), DB Rows (Not RPT)

 I recently started doing 10 minute cardio sessions on Sundays (for health, not fat loss) - burpees and kb swings. I didn't do any cardio during my recomp.

 All RPT exercises are done for 5, 6 and 7 reps (except dips - I try to do 8, 10 and 12 for those).

-Staple foods: naan, chicken, hummus, spinach, pomegranate seeds, cereal/milk, QUEST BARS (best snack), nonfat ham, low-calorie bagel thins/tortillas, variety of sweets. I eat fish about 1x/week.

-I drink green/black tea every morning. I don't take any other supplements (I need to start taking some vitamin d3, though).

-I usually get around 7 hours of sleep/night (at least 6).

-I've probably had about 1 cheat meal every two weeks on average, which includes eating almost an entire large Chicago deep dish pizza (in 2 hours). I see a lot of posts asking how to respond to an unexpected cheat meal; seriously, don't worry about them. They mean nothing.

Thanks again to this awesome subreddit/Martin Berkhan/Andy Morgan. I really appreciate all the free information. I mostly just wanted to provide further evidence that leangains works.

http://www.1percentedge.com/ifcalc/

Sorry that it's created in Flash, I was working on another project using Flash Builder when I got the bug to build this, so that's what I used.

Special thanks to redditor ""whydoibother"" for all his help with suggestions, testing, etc.

And yes, I realize in the long run how ridiculous it is to do all this math and calculations when getting base BMR/TDEE values from simple multiplers and adding +/-% and then listening to your body and how it responds is probably just as effective.

However, there are so many ""numbers check"" posts and ""how do I get started"", etc. that I thought this at might least be a way to get people started or at least to the point where they have enough information to make an intelligent/informed post.

Besides, it was a fun project.

I still have a list of features that I want to add/change, both functional and cosmentic, but I'm open to any suggestions/requests and of course bug reports as well.

There is no sanity checking on the values you enter, so if you tell the program you're 50ft tall, weight 100lbs with 1% bodyfat and want to lose 150 pounds you're going to get some strange results...

EDIT: Good morning! I just uploaded ver 1.0.1 that fixes the problems with the calculated bodyfat formula and waist-to-height ratio calculation when using metric.

EDIT2: Couple more fixes posted in ver 1.0.2...

EDIT3: Version 1.0.5 released (10/21/2011), see post below for changes

EDIT4: There is a bug in 1.0.5 that causes the Minimum Recommended Daily Calories to recalculate incorrectly if you change any other user-input information after setting bf%.

One guy asked if I wanted to do an AMA.  I said this:

&gt;If someone sets one up for me, sure. Though I don't have any pics of myself and people are bound to call me on it. Doesn't seem worth the hassle to be questioned about my stats if I'm trying to help.

That still applies.  I have tats on a large portion of my body and a public job, so any pictures I put up can be easily recognized by people I see in day-to-day life.  Blocking out the tattoos would be useless because then you wouldn't see any of my body.

*But* if people are willing to take me at my word, I can answer some questions for the next day or two.  They can be as specific as you want.  I'll leave this here overnight, return tomorrow morning to answer questions, and do the same thing the next day.  After that, I'm gone (and by then, people's interest will wane).

**About me:**  Just turned 23.  Been training since age 15.  6'1"", 201lb.  No idea of BF%, but low enough that I can see ab veins after my workout day meal.  Currently on a cut to as low as I can get before I start losing strength.  I figure I can lose 10 more pounds and be fucking *shredded*.  Worked with Martin about 2 years ago.

**Lifts from this week: **

* Dead: 6x485
* Bench: 5x310
* Squats: Don't do.  I max the 45-degree leg press at my gym at 23 plates (1035lb) for 9 reps.  But you can't compare this number with what you do because every leg press is different.  I will say that my hamstrings are my strongest body part.

EDIT: I also have thoughts about Andy from Ripped Body JP that he and you probably won't like (since he's treated like a God here).  I don't have anything against him as a person but I think his method is sub-par and kind of a bastardization of the original protocol.  Don't ask me about him.

DOUBLE EDIT: You can ask me direct questions.  There's no need to be oblique.  If you want to know my exact workout routine, ask.  If you want to know the exact diet *Martin* gave me, ask that.  Don't sidestep what you want to know.  Questions like this:

&gt;Was the workout programming for cutting similar to the rpt guide on rippedbody?

...annoy me because it's pretty clear the real interest lies in getting the routine Martin gave me, *not*  in abstract similarities between Martin's routine and the one on Ripped Body JP.

After the first week the hunger of not eating breakfast isn’t an issue.  No more 6 small meals a day and you can eat large satisfying meals and still lose weight!

2.	Keep a record of your progress!! Take photos, weigh and measure yourself, track your lifting achievements.  When you look back in 2,3,6,9 months you will be amazed at the boost it gives you to see how far you have come!  Wish I had done this more!

3.	Low fat on training days. I thought this meant as low as possible, this maybe ok at high BF percentages but the lower you go in BF the more issues you may have especially with low testosterone!! Now I stick to 50g on workout days so just beware!

4.	Low carb on rest days.  Much like low fat on training days, I tried to eliminate carbs as much as possible but always felt a bit light headed.  Raising my carbs reduced this problem and also now have more energy all the time. Low carb is now 120-150g for me.

5.	You don’t need lots of fancy exercises, squat, deads, chest press, pull/chin ups &amp; overhead press will do pretty much everything you need.

6.	Black coffee is amazing.

7.	Green tea doesn’t  taste too bad.

8.	If you are making progress be that losing weight, gaining strength then carry on as you are don’t change stuff just for the sake of it.

9.	You don’t need to get all your carbs from whole/low GI foods.  Mix it up, means you are less likely to binge!!

10.	If you are going out for a meal don’t fret it just enjoy the meal and get back on it the next day.

11.    Listen to your body! If you need to miss a day then its fine! All your progress or muscle wont be lost but if you push your body too far you may need to miss more than just the one sessions.

12.  Protein is important but you need to be sensible if you have too high a protein intake you restrict your carbs and fat intake both of which are also important see 3 &amp; 4.

Am sure there are lots more thing but these are things that spring to mind!  Now just wish I followed the above advice!! ;)

**Okay, so the big question that people seem to ask a lot: Does it work for college?**
&gt; Yes! It works *amazing* for college. Having done several other diet styles, I can honestly say LG is perfectly adapted to a college lifestyle. There's many reasons for this which I'll talk about later, but the big one (and also the one people seem to worry about the most) is **focus**. During the fast, you're going to have seriously increased concentration. I plan my most difficult classes to be during the fast (organic chemistry) so that I can benefit from this. 

**Irritability?**
&gt;Chug coffee or green tea (you hipster) like there's no tomorrow, and stick to a schedule. Eventually your body will become used to the fast and it will feel as amazing as waking up at 1 pm Saturday morning.

**Scheduling**
&gt;This is the other wonderful thing about LeanGains. *You can sleep an extra half an hour because you're skipping breakfast bro!* As you college students will know, that extra half hour of sleep is pure nirvana. 

&gt;In terms of scheduling the fast, you have a couple of options. I know that there are some of you out there who have classes straight from 9 am to 5 pm and don't have time to eat lunch and can't have a normal 12-8 eating window. There's no cut and dry answer to this as you'll have to work things into your own schedule, but my advice is to schedule the fast as best you can, and don't worry if it ends up being a 14 hour fast or 13 hour rather than a 16 hour one. Just do the best you can. I do recommend timing the window so you can have dinner with your bros though. 

**Workouts**
&gt;I strongly recommend scheduling your workouts on a M-W-F cycle. While scheduling things F-S-T or something like that may make things easier because you'll be working out on the weekend, The M-W-F schedule means you don't have to worry about lifting hungover Saturday or Sunday morning and you can drink to your heart's desire Friday and Saturday night. I don't know how much of a concern this is to people, but the last time I drank on a Thursday night (no class for entire school Friday) my Friday workout was not fun. 

&gt;In terms of timing around classes. You have a few options, again obviously depending on your schedule and preferences. The thing to keep in mind is that it's really not too hard to schedule workouts around classes. I can wake up, get coffee, get to the gym, shower, and get to class in 2 hours, which means I get up at 8 M-W-F to lift before my 10 am classes. If it takes you longer than that to get in and out of the gym (assuming a short commute to the university gym of course) you need to stop masturbating in the shower and stop doing curls in the squat rack, brah. So basically, you just need to find some 1:45 to 2 hour spaces you can lift in on M-W-F. If that means eating at night, like I said earlier, don't stress about the fast. If you miss the 16 hour window on your workout days don't worry about it. Get your calories in and move on.

**Drinking**
&gt;Woah there man, you don't drink do you?? You're not 21 yet! In all seriousness, I won't cover this too much because it's been covered by smarter and more informed people than myself. The only piece of advice I can really add is what I talked about earlier with having your workouts M-W-F so you don't have to worry about lifting hungover. For more info check out Martin's article here: [article](http://www.leangains.com/2010/07/truth-about-alcohol-fat-loss-and-muscle.html). 

&gt;EDIT: Thought I'd add it what dbpdaemon said about drinking hard alcohol: if you're gonna drink, it's best to go for the harder alcohols because they'll affect your fast and your macro makeup for the day less. Personally if I'm going to drink I just go for it and do whatever since I don't drink super often, but for those of you who spend a bit more time in the bottle this would definitely be useful.

**Meeting Macros**
&gt;For those of you with a sick dining hall(s) and meal plan, this may not be a problem, but for the rest of us there may be some things to think about. The first to consider is that if you're on a ""meals/week"" type plan you no longer need 3 meals a day or more. You can get away with 2 meals a day on LG, easily. This can definitely help save you money. 

&gt;For those of you with a money based meal plan or a bad dining hall that doesn't serve lots of protein, I recommend having cheap stuff that helps you meet your macros in your dorm/apartment or whatever. Good things to have are whey protein, oatmeal, peanut butter, Greek yogurt and cottage cheese. I buy these in bulk and eat them to try to bring down the cost per week of my current meal plan. Overall though, if you're on a meal plan you probably won't have complete control over your diet, so don't stress if you get too many fats on your workout days or too many carbs on rest days. Just do the best you can, and keep your calories in line. Consistency and calories matter the most.

&gt;[EDIT: Added link to useful comment by wesimplymustknow about preparing your own protein.](http://www.reddit.com/r/leangains/comments/10kciw/college_leangains_a_guide/c6ei2z2)

&gt;Also, I just remembered that most larger universities put nutritional info on their websites. However, I've found this to be inaccurate at best, so I recommend using the info on their site as a starting point and then tweaking from common sense (I don't think that one chicken breast had 70g of protein and 110 carbs, thank you very much BC). 

Well, that's basically it for now. I'll edit as I think of new stuff/questions come up. I'll try to keep track of my own thoughts and useful comments on here so that this can become a good resource for college students.

",116,20,121,http://www.reddit.com/r/leangains/comments/1171ax/living_in_a_new_country_full_of_lean_jacked_dudes/,"Moved to Malaysia for work last year.  I'm an absolute fitness and nutrition fanatic.  I've tested just about every diet and workout routine out there and documented my gains (i.e., strength, size, endurance, etc) to compare results.  Spending most of my life and intense training in the West, I've followed the ""protein protein protein"" dogma more cycles and years than not.

**That being said, I'm going to throw a wrench into this dogma that I still don't fully understand and desperately want to:  nearly all the men here (that aren't office jockeys) are absolutely rippling with vascular, well-defined muscles.  And not one focuses on protein (?!).**  Including world champion fighters.  Pound for pound, they are the strongest men I've ever worked or trained with on the planet.  

**What do they do?** Quite simply, they use their bodies for work.  Most are laborers of some sort - be it builders, movers or craftsmen - and nearly all are farmers.  **What do they eat?**  Without fail, a simple, repetitive diet high in carbs and *exceptionally* low in protein by my own, and any Western fitness diet standards.  Literally the only items on the menu:  white rice (heaps), green leafy vegetables, starchy root vegetables like cassava, tempeh, eggs (even the most jacked guy will only eat one), chicken and beef.  Supplemented with a fairly narrow variety of fruits like bananas, mango, durians, and a couple others.  Portions of meat are SMALL, and maybe twice a day at most.      

I too, with great horror and trepidation, have followed this diet because I have no other choice.  To my absolute surprise, I have seen my fat decrease and strength *increase*.  Energy and endurance are through the roof.   I admittedly have not focused on hypertrophy or bulking given that its difficult to get the calories here, and I imagine it would be substantially more difficult relative to in the West, but at the same time I am surrounded by guys with physiques for the textbooks.  

Can anyone explain this?!  It is shattering my long-held beliefs about Protein.  Somebody show me the light please.  Genetics can only carry these guys so far.  Something is going on here, I'm noticing it with my own body too.  

**TL/DR:  Working in a country where the majority of working age men are RIPPED and eat very, very little protein.  As a nutrition/fitness junkie that always has gone high P, I'm thoroughly confused.  Also noticing a very conspicuous lack of loss of my gains from training in the West.  Actually getting stronger and feeling better (?!)**

**Stats:**

* Sex: Male 
* Age: 32 
* Height: 5'6"" | 168cm 
* Weight change: 77kg | 169lbs -&gt; 62.5kg | 137lbs (14kg | 30lbs down) 
* Body fat change (approx): 30% -&gt; 15% 
* Waist change: 34"" -&gt; 29"" 


**Diet:**

* Leagains, IIFYM approach 
* 2 meals a day, lunch at 1.30pm and dinner at 9pm.
* Macros split in grams (Protein/Carb/Fat): Training day - 130/170/50, Rest day - 140/25/65
* No calorie counting, just rough weighing, eyeballing.
* Greens (Cucumber, capsicum, celery, broccoli) with every meal, not counted against macros
* Snacking and incorporating some 'junk' like chips, chocolates etc, especially in post workout high carb meal.
* Very little dairy
* Workout day, 60% of intake post workout
* A Gallon of water everyday, basically until pee turned transparent. Am peeing every few hours during the day.
* No protein shakes or any other drinks other than multiple cups of black coffee or green tea with stevia in the morning
* Fat sources: Avocados, Raw organic peanut butter, Olive oil
* Protein sources: Turkey (burgers, fillets, mince), Chicken, Beef (Steaks), Tuna
* Carb sources: All kinds but mainly breads, rice, pasta, and I counted all sugars as carbs 
* Fibre sources: Lentils, baked beans, hi fibre breads and muffins
* Did not worry about sodium at all.


**Exercise:**

* Based on Starting Strength, done at home with a barbell, weights and squat rack + bench
* Lifting 3 days a week. Occasional 4th day for assitance excercises for abs, triceps, biceps
* 4 main compound lifts done first in workout sessions - squat. bench, deadlift, overhead press
* Added in chin ups &amp; pendlay rows after 2 months as I felt I was recovering well and could handle more volume


**Current weights on major lifts** (consistent strength gains and only just hitting a plateau):

* Bench: 5 x 120 lbs 
* Squat: 5 x 200 lbs 
* Deadlift: 5 x 250 lbs 
* Overhead press: 5 x 75lbs 


**Motivation:**

* Breaking an ankle and getting a plate and pins put in, 3 month recovery period and weight gain as a result of inactivity. Went through a messy divorce at the same time, but thankfully got custody of my two young kids. Was pretty much home bound in the evenings and wanted to do something about my fitness at home.


**Learnings:**

* I will never see nutrition and eating in the same light ever again. This is from a past of having tried the whole 6 meals and training, then just being plain lazy and eating all kinds of stuff for 3 regular meals and binging, snacking on junk (whole packs of chips, crisps and giant bars of chocolates, coke instead of water).
* I think the key for me has been consistency with the workouts. I probably missed one session since I started. And putting form before weights and ego has helped with avoiding injury. (touch wood)
* Have proved to myself that it's possible to do this at home with a simple setup (cost me $650 for all my equipment, second hand)


**Next Steps:**

I've just done a full diet break for 2 weeks (not binging, just not counting macros and eating to hunger, at least 150g carbs everyday). Now continuing on my cut for another month or so before starting a slow bulk.

First go to My Home -&gt; Goals -&gt; Change Goals, and use the 'Custom' option so you can pick custom calorie and macro goals. Simply pick the goals for your rest day. Now we just need a way to change this for the workout day quickly.

There are two ways to do it, depending on whether the carb/fat breakdown changes too (eg. if you're doing 50/50 both days, then you go with method A, but if it's 25/75 - 75/25 or such then method B).

**Method A: Only calorie goal changes**

This is easy. Say you have 1500 calories on rest days, but 2000 on workout days, and macro ratios don't change. In this case, just make a new exercise on myfitnesspal called 'Workout Day Surplus' or something, and make it be worth 500 calories. Click 'Exercises' on top, then 'My Exercises', and make a new cardiovascular exercises. Time or name doesn't matter, what's important is that the calories burned is equal to the difference between your rest day and workout day calories.

Now, you simply add this exercise on workout days, and myfitnesspal will increase your calorie window for that day, and also automatically adjust the macros ratios. Magic!

**Method B: Both calorie goal and macro ratio change**

This is a little trickier. First, you must calculate the difference in calories between workout and rest days. Call this dR. Also calculate similarly the difference in carbs and fat (in grams), say dC and dF respectively. Now, create a new food, which has a calorific value of -dR, a carb value of -dC, and a fat value of dF. Yes, myfitnesspal allows negative values, heh. Now, if you add this food on workout days, the carbs/fats/calories remaining will be correct for workout day levels.

Since method B might be a little confusing, here's an [example](http://i.imgur.com/gQLg0.png).

Hope you guys find this useful! Since Method B is kind of weird (the totals that myfitnesspal will show you can go into negatives and are just inaccurate, only the 'remaining' values make sense any more), you might just want to use Method A and only cycle the calories and just remember the macro values you're looking for.",,False,,t5_2saqe,False,,,True,t3_15ss9j,http://www.reddit.com/r/leangains/comments/15ss9j/myfitnesspal_carbcaloriecycling_hack/,

###Step 1: Figure out your [macros](http://rippedbody.jp/2011/10/23/how-to-calculate-leangains-macros/). 

----

###Step 2: Plan your workout day carbs.


##Here are some ways to get 50g carbs:

* 8 oz sweet potato
* 1/3 cup jasmine rice (raw)
* 1.3 lb kabocha squash
* 2 medium-sized fruits

&gt; So if you needed 220g carbs on workout days, that's 1 lb sweet potato + 2 fruit + 1/3 cup raw rice per workout day. Mix and match for some variety in your life.

(Also, round down, since vegetables will fill in some extra carbage.)

----

###Step 3: Plan your workout day lean protein.

##Here are some ways to get 50g lean protein:

* 1/2 lb chicken breast
* 1/2 lb turkey breast
* 1/2 lb shrimp
* 1/2 lb lean white fish (eg: tilapia, etc.)
* one dozen egg whites
* 50g protein worth of protein powder

&gt; So if you needed 150g protein on workout days, that's 1.5 lb of very lean meat.

----

###Step 4: Plan your rest day fats.

Rest days should be a bit of a mental break in terms of strict macroing, so use this time to indulge in what you're craving.

Fattier meats/fish? Go for it. Coconut butter straight from the jar? Sure.

&gt; For this example, let's say I want a whole avocado (noms!) and I'm inclined towards a tasty looking 8 oz salmon. That would put me at 45g fat and 61g protein that comes with it.

----

###Step 5: Fill your rest day remaining protein.

Unless you're a ghee-from-the-jar kind of person, chances are that planning your rest day fats got you some protein as well.

Chances are good, though, that you're not quite at your protein goals for the day yet though: you probably need to ""fill"" with some remaining protein. (The fattier meat you chose in step 4, the more lean protein you'll need to supplement.)

&gt; For example, in Step 4 I chose an avocado and salmon, which got me 61g protein, but my goal is 200g protein on rest days, so I still need 140g of it. How do I get it? See step 3 for a list of lean proteins.

----

###Step 6: Fill with vegetables.

Don't forget your veggies! A common leangains mistake is to be so focussed on foods that complete macro ratios that you forget all about your veggies.

&gt; I like to plan for ~1.5-2 lb veggies per day, but your mileage may vary.

Remember that veggies keep you full on rest days (yay!) and help reduce insulin spikes on high-carb workout days (yay!).",,False,,t5_2saqe,1343735073.0,,,True,t3_xfzz6,http://www.reddit.com/r/leangains/comments/xfzz6/lean_gains_food_shopping_guide/,

Since I have found so much inspiration in this community, I figured I would try to provide some inspiration of my own. I present my one year journey:

http://i.imgur.com/8rz6X.jpg

The **long story:** I was a fat fuck. I was 255 pounds, had stage two hypertension, suffered a stroke, and had a myriad of other health problems. Couldn't walk a flight of stairs, couldn't lift a fucking thing. After my stroke, I split up with my fiance of 7 years. That was it. I decided enough was enough.

The first couple of months were me being mopey and starving myself. I dropped 20 pounds in the first few weeks. Losing weight was awesome. I wanted more. I spent every waking moment researching fitness and nutrition. I quickly dispelled all the bullshit magazine myths about stupid workout routines and decided I wanted to gain strength and not look like a fat fuck anymore. I started IF in February of 2012, started LG in July. I busted my ass on a 3 day split and forced myself to add weight every time I hit the gym. I progressed quickly on DL/Squat, but my bench was abysmal (and still is), and I couldn't do a pull-up; not even a neg. I didn't let that shit deter me, and I kept at it. I tweaked my diet, I pushed myself hard, and I would not relent. 

At first it was pretty basic LG. Once I hit 200/300/400, I decided to switch to a hypertrophy routine. I have dicked around with my diet and routine somewhat over the span of my training, but the core has been the same: Do the big 5 and lift heavy shit. I know im no supermodel and I still have a loooooong way to go; I just wanted to share this with the community and hopefully motivate someone just like me to stop allowing mediocrity to rule their life and get their shit together. 

Thanks to this awesome community that has contributed to my success, and many others. I sincerely hope at least one person sees this and decides to make a change in their life.

This post will include my final thoughts, plus some clarifications.

First, some left-over questions that I never got around to answering:

1. **To people concerned about the amount of soy I take in and the effect on estrogen:** 

&gt;It has none.  At least, not to me.  I was also worried that too much soy might sky-rocket my estrogen levels before I started my bulk (I was having 4L soy milk per day and 2 boxes Kashi GoLean, where all the protein comes from soy).  So, I did the smart thing: I ordered bloodwork from LabCorps before I began.  I got the Male Hormone Panel, which includes testosterone, LH, FSH, estradiol, and some others.  Cost was less than $200.  All my hormones were in range.

&gt;Three months later, after 90 days of 4L soy and 2 boxes Kashi, I did the same bloodwork again.  *My estrogen levels were exactly the same.*  (In truth, they were marginally lower.  Not a significant difference.  Accounted by regular hormonal fluctuations.)  No ill-effects on any other hormones, either.  That eased any worries I had lurking in the back of my mind.

&gt;The lesson?  Take everything you read with a grain of salt, and form your own conclusions.  We live in an age where everybody has unparalleled access to medical science.  Use that to your advantage.  Get private bloodwork.  Get DEXA scans.  Figure out how the things you're doing affect *your* body.  There doesn't need to be any guess work.

**Next, select quotes from people who contributed to the AMA that I thought are worthy of mention:**

[**hughdaddy**, about the leaked LeanGains documents:](http://www.reddit.com/r/leangains/comments/1jlsfx/tldr_guide_of_31minutes_ama_pdf/cbgg6nu)


&gt;When the site first came out I put up the link here, but the mods took it down over concern it would hurt Martin's livelihood. That wasn't my opinion, but I'm not a mod.  
It had 2 Word documents, one a FAQ and the other about tracking progression on the diet &amp; making adjustments, as well as an Excel spreadsheet that had a sample training routine, calorie calculator, and weight log. Everything jives 100% with what's said here, except for small details where 31minutes is interjecting his own experience.  
This is it folks, all the ingredients in Martin's secret sauce, and it's nothing you couldn't figure out from reading the FAQ or Martin's site. I think the biggest insight is how 31minutes went about meal planning, as I believe most people fail on Leangains by leaving too much to chance when it comes to meals/food choices - deciding each day what to eat is a huge cognitive waste and drains willpower, dangerous things for a diet.

[**my_clam**, answering his own question about the macros of a cutting diet:](http://www.reddit.com/r/leangains/comments/1jlsfx/tldr_guide_of_31minutes_ama_pdf/cbgnsud)


&gt;You keep the training day at maintenance - 0. Then adjust the rest days as low as needed to get the weekly deficit you want for the BF range you're in (9-11% - 1lb a week - 3500kCal weekly deficit).  
Adjust the carbs for the rest days to only 7% (you can overshoot this number with fibre but it doesn't count). That way the fat ratio is larger. These numbers fit in accordance to 31minutes numbers.  
The rest days seem brutal but I think I like it. It means the cut will be over quicker. I thought I was going to have to start my cut soon to get shredded in time for summer, but using the projected numbers (I set it up -37%/0) I can have an extra month or so bulking and then do the ruthless cut for 12-14 weeks and be ripped... (in theory).


---

**And finally, the [reason I did the AMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/leangains/comments/1jlsfx/tldr_guide_of_31minutes_ama_pdf/cbgl9r2):**


&gt;Sub has value, yes, but people just rehash the same (mis)understandings.  This AMA gives you everything Martin gives his real, paying clients.  

&gt;If people use *this* as their starting point, and if *this* becomes the subreddit's standard, then there is nothing left for me to contribute.  Everybody will have a good idea of what they're doing.

&gt;It's about community and helping one another.  The last thing I wanted was to see Martin's method of LeanGains die out because he quit.  It is, based my fairly extensive experience, the single best program available for people who want to get to an advanced level.  

&gt;People consider Andy as the last standing LG authority.  Andy tries hard, but his program is not LG.  Martin's program works considerably better.  

&gt;I've laid out Martin's entire program here.  Everybody has full access to it.  What people do with it is up to them.  The ""LeanGains Magic"" will not die as long as my AMA and this thread stays up.

---

And with that, I'm gone.  You won't hear from me or see me again.  I'll probably check to see how (if at all) my contribution has changed this subreddit in a few months, but I won't be posting.  I have other things to do with my life. 

**EDIT:** 

PS: People you can direct questions to:

1. [**my_clam**](http://tk.reddit.com/user/my_clam) for diet clarification.  He went from not quite understanding, to asking questions, to having a complete grasp of what I laid out.  He's the one to talk to.

2. [**hughdaddy**](http://www.reddit.com/user/hughdaddy) for general advice.  He is intelligent and has read the LeanGains documents.

1365788189.0,73,self.leangains,1c7va7,Questioning the calorie deficit dogma.,82,9,73,http://www.reddit.com/r/leangains/comments/1c7va7/questioning_the_calorie_deficit_dogma/,"I'm in the process of scouring the literature to answer my question, but I thought I'd try a stab at /r/leangains first. Here's my question:

Is it really possible for trained individuals at a healthy weight to lose fat free mass eating a low calorie/high protein diet in conjunction with sparse, intense weight training?

My hypothesis is that such a thing would be very difficult. [This article](http://fitnessblackbook.com/main/starvation-mode-why-you-probably-never-need-to-worry-about-it/) details a military study in which lean, healthy men (14% bodyfat) were subject to a ~1,200 calorie daily deficit for weeks. Apparently they didn't start losing muscle tissue until they were at around 8% bodyfat. As the article says, these guys were basically tortured and it's safe to assume none of them were eating enough protein or engaging in strength training. Now, I can't find the original study to confirm these findings, but if they're true that seems to really damage the notion that non-super lean individuals can lose muscle tissue just by not eating enough protein. This study (if it exists and has been accurately represented here) is the only one I've ever seen to expose lean, trained men to a VLCD.

The only studies I can ever find on this subject are on obese individuals. [This study](http://www.jacn.org/content/18/2/115.full) put obese individuals on an 800 calorie/day diet and had them either participate in resistance training or aerobic training. The resistance training group lost **30.8 lbs fat** and only **0.88 lbs lean mass.** The aerobic group was not as impressive - they lost 28 lbs fat and 9 lbs LBM, which is not ideal.

Now, I realize these are obese (probably untrained) patients, which is such a different scenario than the average leangains user. Furthermore, I've never tried a very low calorie diet while being very lean. I've never been very lean - only down to about 14% body fat. But on a previous cut (22% &gt; 16%) I ate at a consistent -750 deficit diet and increased all my lifts. I'm an experienced weight lifter (&gt; 5 years, 1.25xBW bench; 2.0xBW squat; 2.1xBW deadlift) so these weren't noob gains. I've been eating 1,500 calories/day for 3 weeks and my lifts keep going up. I've lost 4.2 lbs in that time period and, according to my constant and/or increasing lifts, that's almost entirely fat loss.

My personal opinion is that trained, healthy weight lifters who eat 1g protein/pound LBM a day cannot really lose lean tissue if they're over 10% body fat. I would suggest anyone who thinks they did because their lifts decreased or they ""felt tired"" in the gym were suffering psychological effects of dieting. I'll report back in a few weeks at the end of my cut, but so far my (admittedly young) n=1 experience backs this up. My leangains routine is, as far as I know, basically perfect: fasted RPT weight training 3x a week, 30 min fasted LISS cardio every day, 1 g/lb LBM protein, and cycled macronutrients. The only ""blemish"" might be a constant 1,500 calorie level, but it seems to me this sub focuses too much on small calorie adjustments as well.

So what do you think, /r/leangains? Can anyone convince me they lost muscle on a very low calorie diet while adhering to the basic tenets of leangains? Can anyone find a paper that suggests this is possible? I don't mean to be controversial or troll anyone - I have just never seen evidence that a prototypical leangains follower has lost muscle mass on a very low calorie diet, and I'm curious if such evidence exists.",,False,,t5_2saqe,False,,,True,t3_1c7va7,http://www.reddit.com/r/leangains/comments/1c7va7/questioning_the_calorie_deficit_dogma/,

I went from 85kg to 81.5Kg in that period, but I can say that my body composition changed to the better. I seem to have gained a good amount of strength on all my lifts, expect the bench press due to a rotator cuff injury (watch your form!). Squats went from 90x5 to 110x6, deadlifts from 80x3 to 130x5, chin-ups from 0x8 to 25x5, and bench from 80x5 to 95x6.

Lessons learned:

1. A caloric deficit is good, a large caloric deficit is bad! You might initially be happy with dropping your weight fast, but don't complain when the weight stops coming off after a while. Keep it slow and steady.

2. A caloric surplus is good, it keeps your hormones in check and (I feel) it reduces the possibility of metabolic adaptation that happens to those who constantly diet. In other words, regaining your lost weight after going back to old eating habits for a bit.

3. Want to reduce the binging? Don't be too strict with your diet, don't limit your intake to ""healthy items"", indulge (as long as it fits your macros). I have seen better adherence and results when i occasionally replace my steak and broccoli meal with a large cheeseburger on my rest day (as long as it fits my macros for the day). Also make sure that you are NOT consuming too little food.

4. Don't expect to keep on increasing your strength on a cut, you will plateau after sometime, unless you're a beginner. The moment i went from -20/0 to a -20/+20, I broke my plateau, and gained a bit of muscle and strength. Some of you might be saying ""duh!"" right now, but I bet that there are many people out there who continue to attempt cutting and gaining strength for far too long, and without much success (I am guilty of this).

5. This might sound counter-intuitive, but increasing calories can be what is required to continue losing fat, that's especially true when you become pretty lean. I don't know the reasoning behind this, but that is something that I went through after reaching a weight loss plateau.

6. When I starting LG, I was working out 5 times a week and did cardio, then reduced to 4, and eventually ended up working out 3 times a week and no cardio, and my fat loss did not slow down. It all depends on your calories. I honestly believe that it is 80% food and 20% exercise at this moment in time. Your joints will also thank you in the long run, sorry rotator cuff!

I am sure that there will be those who might disagree with me, but the above points are what I have noticed from my LG experience in the last 6 months. If you have anything to add or alter, please share your knowledge and experience!

Finally, please view my pictures and give me your advice on whether I should cut, bulk or recomp. Much appreciated!

It wasn't until now that I was bored enough to investigate, and I was able to turn up a bit of information that I thought the community might enjoy &amp; obsess over.  I created a PDF that contains copied/pasted excerpts from Martin, with a few asides from Lyle McDonald &amp; Blade (as noted in italics), as well as questions from various forum members (also in italics).  As a side note, it was interesting to see how that particular forum was cordial &amp; friendly circa 2006/2007, but anyone familiar with its current state knows how bitter things have turned, culminating with Martin seemingly leaving the forum last year.

The document covers a lot of different topics, but the general TL;DR is that it has some of the finer details of Martin's 2006 cut, 2006 bulk, and 2007 cut that created the physique he became known for.  Plus his general client approach from before his website went live &amp; shit got real.

I cut down to 188lbs pretty easily, but thought I had lost too much muscle, so I started slowly bulking back to ~195lbs, which is where I am currently. I just added about 400cals to each day for my bulk.

Here is an album of my progress:

It's nothing dramatic, and the pics are horrible from cell phones - but I consider the LG method a success for me.


Edit: Strength didn't increase as I lost weight, but I didn't lose much, if any, either. Even at 190lbs I could Bench 315x3, Squat 415x3, and pull over 500.
As I began to bulk though, I gained a bit more strength on my lifts, and am currently at Bench 335x3 / Squat 435x3 / DL 485x8. (Not even sure where my max is on DL as I've been doing more reps lately.)

When I started LeanGains I had been out of the gym for several years (as you can probably tell from a chest that was pathetically devoid of muscle) so I chose StrongLifts to get back into the habit of lifting. I think I'm beginning to reach the maximum gains I can expect from lifting according to that protocol, however, so I am toying with the idea of changing to either the MadCow program, as promoted by Medhi of StongLifts, or the RPT program as recommended by Martin. In all, I've found LeanGains to be an incredibly effective way to manage my diet. While my change isn't as impressive as some of the results others have experienced, they are real and they have been relatively easy to come by. I might also mention that I try to integrate the Primal Blueprint/Paleo diet recommendations into what I do (I probably eat more quinoa and beans than the PB would recommend and more dairy than the Paleo community would recommend). This might explain why my results are not as striking as some because generally my macros are slightly skewed from my targets (I generally get more fat and fewer carbs than my targets).

I've bought a scale 10 days ago. It has absolutely revolutionized how I think and deal with food.

Once you've paid for a scale and a measuring cup, you kind of have to use it. You quickly realize that your eyeballing wasn't accurate at all. The 150g of noodles really were 300g. The 200g of sweet potatoes actually are 300g. Etc etc. 

How much is 2 big spoons of yoghurt? That would be 100g already.

How much is half a big glass of milk? That's a quarter of a liter already.

You really have no idea.

Secondly, once you measure, now you have to start looking at nutritional data. If you were to lazy to do it before, well now you have to. You have 100g of oats on your scale, ok what does that mean? It means nothing yet. You have to look the details up to see carbs/protein/fat content. (step 2)

Once you've looked it up, you need to log it, right? If you were too lazy to use myfitnesspal before, now you have to do it, otherwise you've just wasted your time. (step 3)

[Final Pictures](http://imgur.com/a/XQyKb#4)

I know the lighting is better and the final pictures don't meet the requirements. Right now is the best time I have to submit a completion post. I'll update on Sunday with pictures that meet the requirements and allow for a fair assessment. Although the lighting is better in the final pics, you can definitely tell an improvement has been made!

**EDIT:** [Official Final Pictures](http://imgur.com/a/mZVi9#1)

**[Average Weekly Weight](http://imgur.com/BGmsJ)**

* Final Weight: 140.8lbs
* I had a *huge* meal the day before the competition began, which would explain the starting weight of 152lbs. I think realistically I was close to 150lbs. Additionally, although my current weight is 140.8lbs, a portion of the weight lost must be due to water weight. Taking that into account, I would guess I lost somewhere around 8lbs. I'll later use this figure for caloric calculations.

**Lifts (all listed as 5RM)**

* Deadlift: 245 --&gt; 260
* Squat: 185 --&gt; 225
* Bench: 145 --&gt; 165
* OHP: 95 --&gt; 105
* Chins: BW+30 --&gt; BW+45
* Dips: BW+45 --&gt; BW+75
* LISS on rest days for the first 8 weeks (no LISS following that)
* Notes: while I deviated in the specific structure of my lifting plan, the important part (I believe) is that I stuck to the same lifts in the same style: Reverse Pyramid Training (RPT). I have to say, I love RPT. I left the gym feeling drained every session and always felt like I was working hard. The only lift that isn't listed above that I am currently performing is DB Rows.

**Supplements**

* Yohimbine HCl
* Creatine
* Multivitamin
* Fish Oil
* Calcium / Vitamin D
* BCAAs pre-workout
* Whey Protein
* Notes: I'm not sure whether or not the Yohimbine aided in fat burn and if the creatine was helpful during the lifting sessions. I stopped taking both of these supplements in my final week and noticed a drop in weight (most likely due to water loss). The Yohimbine may have been doing a good job of staving off hunger as I felt quite hungry in the mornings this past week. As for creatine, my lifts didn't seem to suffer without it this week.

**Diet**

* High protein every day (150-200g)
* High carb (&gt;250g) and low fat (&lt;30g) on workout days
* High fat (&gt;75g) and low carb (&lt;50g) on rest days
* Eating window of 11am - 7pm
* Drank on average once a week (maybe 8 times out of the 11 weekends)
* All calories were consumed post-workout with the exception of BCAAs
* Weeks 1-7: 2400/1600 Workout Day (WOD)/Rest Day (RD) split
* Weeks 8-10: 2650/1750 WOD/RD split
* Weeks 11-12: 2300/1700 WOD/RD split
* Notes: I ate healthy most of the time. However, there were times where I ate according to If It Fits Your Macros (IIFYM). For example, after all my workouts this past week, I had a box of low-fat pop-tarts. Another common post-workout meal was 2 footlong subs from Subway. I also want to say that you can definitely get good results and still enjoy yourself and have a few drinks, provided its done carefully and in moderation.

**Calculations**

I always recorded how much I ate and how much I walked. Below are some calculations that sate my curiosity.

* Total Calories Burned (TCB) due to walking (both LISS and daily walking) = 38360 kcal
* Total Calories Consumed (TCC) = 166300 kcal
* Effective Calories Consumed (ECC = TCC - TCB) = 127940 kcal
* Weight Loss Calories (WLC = 8 lbs x 3500 kcals / lb) = 28000 kcal
* Calories for Sedentary Maintenance (CSM = ECC + WLC) = 155940 kcal
* Calories for Sedentary Maintenance / Day (CSM/D = CSM / 82 days) = **1900 kcal / day**
* Calories for Active Maintenance (CAM = TCC + WLC) = 194300 kcal
* Calories for Active Maintenance / Day (CAM/D = CAM / 82 days) = **2370 kcal / day**
* Notes: This is assuming I lost 8lbs of fat. It is also assuming that the tool I used to track calories burned walking was accurate. Putting aside these gaping holes in reliability and accuracy, I find it interesting that my calculated CSM/D was *incredibly* close to the 1927 kcal / day spit out by the this [Intermittent Fasting (IF) Calculator](http://www.1percentedge.com/ifcalc/) provided you enter 5'7"" at 141lbs. Additionally, if someone were to ask me what I thought my CAM/D would be before I calculated it, I would have guess somewhere between 2300 and 2400 kcal, which is indeed close to my calculated value of 2370 kcal.

**Goals Evaluation**

After 12 weeks, I'm *ecstatic* about my progress. I'm feeling much more confident about having my shirt off and I think I look good naked. However, I don't think I'm quite at my goal of unflexed six-pack...

**Future Goals**

I am going to continue working towards that unflexed six pack! I think it's a better goal than a specific bodyfat % as a number seems awfully arbitrary, while a goal associated with a specific change in the way your body looks seems much more substantial. That begs the question, what do you guys think I should do? Should I continue cutting? Should I recomp? Is the jury out?! Right now, I'm think of performing a slow cut to the level of leanness I want. However, seeing the recent progress post in /r/fitness made by an individual revealing his success with a recomp, I might be inclined to try it!",,False,,t5_2saqe,False,,,True,t3_13dh0p,http://www.reddit.com/r/leangains/comments/13dh0p/though_you_guys_might_be_interested_in_my_very/,

[Progress](http://i.imgur.com/uEJ82uK.jpg)

I started out at 145lb and am now 135lb.  I did a -30/-10 cut to shed all the unnecessary body fat.  I also followed the RPT Training method while on LG.  Like most people i was skeptical of LG initially but kept seeing all these results and said Fuck this i'm trying it out.  The first week was tough adapting to the diet and the whole intermittent fasting but after that it was a cakewalk.  I made great progress in my lifts.  Bench and OH Press were the only 2 to go slower on the progression scale but still gained.  My highest for bench was 5 x 155 and OH Press was 5 x 95. My deadlifts and squats went up pretty quickly.  Currently, DL 5 x 240 with no prob and  Monday i was able to squat 5 x 205.  

As for following the diet strictly ...nah.  I followed it very loosely. I did 1/g per lb of bodyweight in Protein, I kept an eye on the caloric intake, as well as the macros but overall I just made sure on Workout days it was Carb overload and non workout days Fat overload.

Ha, no, just kidding. But I actually quit Leangains because I haven't had much success. I'd like to explain why and hopefully help any others that are having trouble.


I am 28 years-old, 6 foot 1, and a 235 lb. amateur power-lifter. I would guess I'm 20% body fat now but I've never measured. I initially tried Leangains to lose body fat while hopefully maintaining my strength. I did the whole 9 yards: used the macro calculator and decided on a -20/0, fasted 16 hours with an eight hour feeding window (1PM-9PM), hit my macros while enjoying IFIFYM, lifted heavy and slept normally. I got accustomed to the fasting period and enjoyed it (though I was occasionally irritable), but the only thing that happened other than that was I felt like crap and I didn't lose any weight.


I know a lot of people will say I did something wrong. I thought so, too. I initially set the macro calculator to the slightly active modifier and did that for approximately 4 months. Then I changed it to inactive, or whatever the lowest modifier setting is. Did that for two months. Nothing. Wild swings in energy after ending my fast. And man was I grumpy and lethargic after my post-workout meal. These ups and downs were really starting to get to me and put a lot of strain on my girlfriend and I. I couldn't figure out what I was doing wrong and it felt like I was spinning my wheels. And the worst part: no weight loss.


But it was something a user here commented on that caught my attention one day. He or she said, ""I believe anyone over 20% body fat should not have more than 200 grams of carbs in a day."" That got my attention, and I realized that for me, poor insulin metabolism might be the culprit. My 300-400 grams of carbs on workout days might not be in my best interest. 


So, I stopped fasting, and I'm now doing a -30/-10 and keeping my carbs to 100 grams on rest day and 200 grams on training days. I eat 1 grams of protein for each lb. of lean body mass (so about 180-190 grams of protein each day) and the rest of my calories from fat. I eat about four times a day, and I feel much better and am now without the mood and energy swings that plagued me before. In one month I have lost about 12 pounds and my lifts are still solid.


I know that Leangains has worked for a lot of people in this subreddit, but I just wanted to share my story for any bigger people out there who might not be seeing success. A lot of people say it and it might be true: maybe Leangains is best suited for people in the low body fat range and for people who metabolize insulin normally and perhaps aren't hypoglycemic, etc. 


I still think Leangains is a valuable tool for cutting while helping keep hunger at bay, but I don't think I am ready yet. So for any peeps out there who are like me, don't fast and maybe just do a straight cut and don't cycle your carbs up so high, even on training days (if you feel the need to carb cycle at all). 


I don't have a good pic of me, but here is one of me setting up for [bench](http://imgur.com/0kwEa).

*edit: Added larger spaces between paragraphs

*edit: Some people seem to be missing a big point of my post. If you feel like crap after you eat, maybe do some research into insulin metabolism/hyperglycemia/hypoglycemia/pre-diabetic, etc. If you have an underlying condition where you metabolize insulin poorly or whatever, eating 200-500 grams of carbs in one sitting might exacerbate your situation. MAYBE! I'm just going on by how I felt. For normal people, insulin is your anabolic friend. For me, maybe I need to wait to do IF until my body normalizes and continue to spread my carbs out to minimize the ups and downs of a blood sugar swing.

I'm aware of the fact that the bodyfat calculation is very inaccurate. That's why there's a way to supply your own estimation. *LBM* is relevant to calculate the required *protein*:

Just another dude with a program issue, yeah I know..
I used to be 200kg, went down to 85 in 18 months, lost a lot of mucles (did no practice in the gym only long walks, running etc. but that’s another story). 

Therefor I got a lot of over-due skin. Had a skin overation for the stomach area but the arms, legs and tits are still there.

Been doing gym since Nov 2010, started strickt IF / LG in Feb/Mars of 2012 and I love it!

Since the weightloss ive been slowly going down to 80 and been around 80-85 since I started to gym.

My activity factor is between 1.35-1.5 pending on the day but lets keep it on the downlow and say 1.35.

I’m 184 cm tall, 82 kilos and waist 80.

My BMR is 1936 kcal

TDEE is 2662 (balance)

LBM on 74 kilo (8kg fat)

9.7 BF according to calculation.

Since I got all this overdue skin its kind of hard to know my exact weight guess the diff could be around 2-3kg

I do 3x/ LBM protein which comes out: 222.

222 P = 888 cal


Should I go with +10 -20 or +10 -30?

Training: 2900 cal 435 C 32 F   

-20: 2100 cal 105 C 90 F

-30: 1900 cal 50 C 85 F


P is kept 222 both days.

-30 = -0.31 /week

-20 = -0.17kg / week



My lifts:

150 v 3 Deadlift

120 v 7 Squat (got a leg problem therefor I go slowly on the squats)

85 v 2 Bench

60 v 8 Shoulder press

+10kg v 10 DIPS

+15kg v 5 Chinups

+10kg v 10 Chinups



Would be nice to hear your input my ‘brothers/sisters in arms’!

Thanks!

So far I've found chicken breasts to be ~15% larger than I thought, and sweet potatoes at least 30% more caloric. I tend to round-up for safety but that wasn't enough. Even my eggs are bigger (cue Air Supply). Serving size for a large egg is 50g, and my eggs averaged almost 60.

""Why can't that information be saved and referenced at any time?"" I thought.

So, I created a google docs version of the IF calculator! It's not as full-featured as the flash version, but I enjoy being able to save and view my plan anywhere, change up the macro split, and refocus goals as necessary. I hope someone else finds it beneficial as well!

~~The spreadsheet is currently using the **Mifflin-St. Jeor formula** to calculate BMR, etc.~~

future goals include actual google apps scripting to clean up some code duplication, additional BMR estimators, and all the other things that make the current sidebar IF calculator so beneficial to others.

To copy, just go to **File &gt; Make a copy...** and customize the first page from there

**Edit**: I almost forgot; if you'll notice, I added (much needed, imo) macro days for if you're planning on drinking. If anyone has suggestions for a way to make this feature more complete, let me know

**Edit 2**: Two things: 

- the calculator now uses the **Katch-McArdle** formula for calculating BMR if the body fat % is known; if not, it defaults to the **Mifflin-St. Jeor** formula. 

- I've also added a custom split; to use, select the ""**Custom...**"" option under Rest/Workout split, and input the values under the Custom workout split header.

Went from 186 -&gt; 166.

http://i.imgur.com/8YNzsxa.jpg

First pic is from 1 Jan, second is from today. It took a little longer than it probably should have. I took a 5-week hiatus mid way through to prepare for a PT test.  Once that was complete I climbed back on the wagon. 

Before the hiatus I ate maintenance on workout days and -20% on rest days. I saw pretty good results with this setup.  After the PT test I decided to try eating at a deficit everyday (roughly -20/-40) and incorporated some LISS in the mornings.  Saw great results with this.  

For weightlifting I did:

M: Deadlifts, Chin-ups

W: Weighted Push-ups on Rings, Dips

F: Weighted Walking Lunges

Since I'm in danger of being blown over in a stiff breeze I'm about to take a diet break (2 weeks @ maintenance) and then turn around and slow bulk.  166 is not a comfortable weight for me, but the way I look makes it ok, for now.

**EDIT:** It appears as though there would be a lot of interest in something like this. I'll make a post in the upcoming weeks where people can make their submissions. I think the following will be required:

* Goal (cut, recomp, bulk, etc.) with +/-
* Age
* Weight
* Sex
* Routine
* Lifting stats
* Workout / Rest Day Macros
* Front / Back Pictures
* Supplements

I understand that that is a lot of information. However, if there are a lot of successes, I'm sure people will want to know all the details. I think that by providing them in the initial post, we can avoid a lot of repetitive questions.

Plain and simple, Intermittent fasting IS the best diet protocol out there. It's not really about the food you eat, it's about how much of it + fasting (also: diet adherance, consistency, calorie counting made easy, etc). Been doing leangains for 6 months now, and this is about 8-10 weeks into a cut. Cheated once a week (1pm to 1pm, 24 hr cheat day, usually fridays, and drinking was to be done on that day. I can give more details if asked), used +30/-10, +20/-20, 0/-30, +10/-30, +10/-35 for various goals. Training was all custom programs which were goal specific and now I am currently training for my upcoming D1 soccer season, so the training is geared around it AND I still fast 16-18 hrs every day (and train fasted too)

Questions? I will answer everything you need to know.

I was 22% body-fat/220 lbs/38 inch waist in first pic.
I am now around 12% bf/180 lbs/32 in waist.

This change wasn't completely due to LG, but let me explain:

I've been trying to bust my ass in shape for 3 years.  I've tried a lot of exercise routines and nutrition strategies.  Slow carb diet.  General carb cycling.  More weight routines than I can remember.  But I always ran into 2 problems:

1) I would get skinny, but have no muscle definiton.
2) When I tried to ""bulk up,"" I would gain fat in addition to the muscle, so I never looked any better. Frustrating as Hell.

But then I found Lean Gains.  Thank you, Martin.  Thank you, anyone who has contributed an online resource (the IF Calculator and Examine.com resources here helped me a ton).  

I hesitated at first, as going so many hours without eating seemed like heresey to me (I drank the ""small, frequent meals"" Kool-Aid for years)... but I bit the bullet, and I'm so glad I did.

My body and strength are progressing faster than ever.  My stomach prefers fasting, as evidenced by smoother digestion and less grumbling throughout the day.  Also, LG is the most convenient plan I have ever tried.  It's nice to only eat once or twice a day versus, like, SIX small meals.

I'm getting the impression most people here are rather experienced--but if you're a beginner or intermediate lost in a sea of workout and diet programs and don't know which to follow--let me encourage you to try this one.  Works MUCH better than anything else I've experienced.  

I wrote a long-ass blog about all of this if you want more details.  More progress pics, more details, etc.  If you want more, it's here:

Hi there, I'm have finished my 3 months recomp and this is my result.

I'm 36 years old, 5.5 height.

I was using RPT workout, and gain some strength, but not much.

The macros used during recomp are on the imgur album.

**This were my stats on December 12, 2012**

Weight: 148,8 lb
Body Fat: around 20%

**This are my stats today:**

Weight: 132 lb
Body Fat: around 13-14%??

I've been in a brake for two weeks eating at maintenance preparing for a slow bulk, this are some of my questions:

* 1) I'm planing to use Greyskull LP during my slow bulk, is this right?
* 2) Can I keep training fasted during bulk, consuming BCCA?
* 3) I'm using 12grams of Purple Wraath as BCAA is this the right amount?
* 4) I have a tube of MP Assault that is 40 cal per serving, can I mix this with Purple Wraath pre workout?
* 5) How ofter should I recalculate my macros during bulk?

The calculated macros for slow bulk are on the imgur album, how they look?

I'm not sure about carbs on rest day, I've read that I should never go below 100grams.
The same for fats on workout days  are those numbers too high?

Thank you guys.

With all the LG'ers in this subreddit we could probably come up with some pretty damn good tips/tricks.  I'm just starting my 2nd cut with Leangains and here are a few things that have really helped out:

* check out [EpicureanBodybuilder.com](http://www.epicureanbb.com/).  It's a food blog written by a sister of one of the creators of Fitocracy.  All the recipes are designed to be ""Leangains friendly"".

* BBQ up half a dozen chicken breasts at a time and store them in your fridge - they always come in handy and it's a huge time saver!

* If your PWO meal is getting too damn big to eat and you lay on the couch after like a boa constrictor trying to digest an antelope, try using your blender more often.  Blending up a couple banana's with some skim milk, low fat ice cream, and protein powder can go a a long way as far as hitting your macronutrients are concerned.  

Another way to make eating 3000+ cals in an 8 hour window on workout days easy is to utilize fasted training.  This does a couple things.  1) It allows you to break your fast with your biggest meal of the day (when your are obviously your most hungry) and 2) it gives you basically your whole 8 hour window to eat your other, smaller 2 meals.  It's not rocket science but it's something that has really helped me.

* Check out Andy at [rippedbody.jp](http://rippedbody.jp/category/english/).  He has a ton of free info on his site to make dieting and training super easy while following Leangains.

* Weigh yourself weekly and take measurements - always in the morning before you have eaten.  If you are losing or gaining weight too fast, you can be sure that you are losing more muscle/gaining more fat than you need to be.  TDEE calculators are only an estimated starting point for calorie intake - adjust your calorie intake as needed based on the results of your weekly weigh ins.

That's a few off the top of my head - Feel free to add.

Never done it before, let me know if I'm doing it wrong.*

[January to May](http://imgur.com/a/UAXdA#0) (tight boxer briefs warning)

*Background:*

I've been really interested in fitness for some years now. I'd been into lifting on and off since college, but never really dedicated to a structured program. Two years ago, I managed to cut down to around 159 lbs, with the intent of building muscle on a small frame. That didn't pan out the way I wanted to (didn't eat nearly enough). Eventually, my interest waned and I let myself go again.

Summer of last year rolls around, and I'm back up to 190 and starting to see (or imagine) man-boobs again. So I started to get my shit together and decided to lose some weight. I went back to a hypertrophy program I had been using for a long time, and cut calories. Progress went *okay*, and I was down to 180 prior to finals, when I let go. That and Christmas gave me about 10 lbs.

Somewhere in all this I discovered reddit, and soon after discovered /r/fitness. Much learning was done, and I decided to start on SS, or a slight variation thereof.

**Routine:**

I felt as though SS workouts were awesome, but I also liked the idea of accessory exercises. So, I took the idea of big, compound lifts, squats every workout, and linear progression. My program is based more off the SS Practical Programming variant, you could say. I don't do clean &amp; jerk, and added pull-ups to every workout. I also started off doing captains chair or bicycle crunches for an abdominal workout.

Recently, I've put less emphasis on abdominals, doing hanging leg raises every so often instead. I add in lateral deltoid raise, Pendlay row, barbell calf raises, and an acessory chest exercise I am switching with something else as well.

Warm-up sets are different to. I generally do 3x5 at 40%/60%/80% of my work weight for that day.

In retrospect, I don't feel as though the accessory workouts were entirely necessary, considering I was on a cut/recomp.

You can see my workout in detail on my [Fitocracy page](http://www.fitocracy.com/profile/jc214x/).

You may notice my DL/Bench are on the low side, and my Press hasn't made much progress. I injured my lower back (pulled a muscle) late last year, and since then it's lagged behind my squat. Then, earlier this year, I pulled a rotator cuff muscle, which put a stop on my bench/press progress for a few weeks. I have never in my life stressed proper form as much as I do now.

You will also notice the relative lack of substantial progress between April and May in my photos. I took a 2 1/2 week hiatus from lifting for finals.

***Edit:***
If you can see my fitocracy page, you'll notice that I often work out 2-3 times per week. I try for 3 days/week, but I'm in grad school and life gets busy oftentimes. I have 2 opposite workout days, and simply alternate between the two. Here's how I have it set up currently:

A:

* Squat (3x5)
* DL (3x5)
* Bench (3x5)
* Weighted Pull-up (3x5)
* Standing Barbell Calf Raise (3x10)
* Hanging leg raise (sometimes) (3x10)
* DB Flyes (subbing out) (3x10)

B:

* Squat (3x5)
* Press (3x5)
* Bench (3x5)
* Weighted Pull-up (3x5)
* Pendlay row (removing) (3x10)
* Lateral Delt Raise (3x5)
* Hanging leg raise (sometimes) (3x10)

This is the general scheme. I'm actually in the process of trying to simplify it, to save gym time.

On rest days, I don't do anything. Occasionally I will do some bouldering, though.

**Diet:**

For the first two months or so, I worked on maintaining a deficit relative to my TDEE for that day. If I worked out, I gave myself extra calories to compensate, shooting for a fairly consistent net deficit. After midterms, I decided to switch to a Leangains-style diet. Little to no food pre-workout, low carb on rest days, low fat on workout days. It seems to have worked fairly well - I have not had any long-term stalls on any of my lifts (aside from press, always has been a challenge). I have deloaded my squat once or twice. Progress is slower than I expect it to be if I were bulking, but that's how it goes.

You can see my diet in detail on my [MFP page](http://www.myfitnesspal.com/food/diary/jc214x).

**My goals now:**

Bulk. It's time. Shooting for a fairly consistent 3000-3200 Cals/day for 8 weeks or so. Low fat. After this, I will reevaluate.

I just finished up a  2-month standard recomp that I began in early January. I figured I'd share my results seeing as there aren't too many before and afters especially for those recomp'ing.

**Macros**

TDEE: 2446

Rest days: 1957 cals (-20%); 82g carbs; 109g fat; 163g protein

Workout days: 2935 cals (+20%); 428g carbs; 63g fat; 163g protein

I was very strict with my macros. I weighed and recorded everything. Basically hit them close to spot on everyday. Some days I would exceed my protein, and when I did I would take sacrifice either fat on workout days or carbs on rest days.

**Before**

[Album](http://imgur.com/a/hAWGE) (taken about mid-December; shitty posing...)

The above pictures were taken right before I went on a 3-week Winter break. During that time I didn't lift or strictly monitor my intake. Shortly after I got back to school early January I began the recomp.

**After**

[Album](http://imgur.com/a/mXSzp) (taken yesterday, 3/10/13)

The above pictures were taken at the end of a 1-week Spring break. Just like over Winter break, I didn't lift or strictly watch what I ate.

I guess the 2 albums are about 3 months apart, but I was actually recomp'ing for only 2 months (early January to early March).

**Routine**

I basically continued doing the program I started back in September, Starting Strength: Practical Programming, and modified it a bit.

Monday:

1. 3x5 Squat
2. 3x5 Bench OR 5x3 OHP (alternating)
3. 3 sets of weighted chins

Wednesday:

1. 3x5 Squat
2. 3x5 Bench OR 5x3 OHP (alternating)
3. 1x5 DL
4. 3 sets of weighted pull ups

Friday:

1. 3x5 Squat
2. 3x5 Bench OR 5x3 OHP (alternating)
3. 3 sets of weighted chins

**Progress**

Squat (5RM): 215 -&gt; 240 (focused a lot on getting my form down)

OHP (3RM): 115 -&gt; 140

Bench (5RM): 175 -&gt; 195

Deadlift (5RM): 180 -&gt; 240 (started on 1/30/13 due to back injury)

Chin Ups: Bodyweight (16 reps) -&gt; 55 (6 reps)

Pull Ups: Bodyweight (14 reps) -&gt; 45 (7 reps)

Bodyweight: ~163 -&gt; ~161 (end of recomp) -&gt; ~164 (after Spring break)

Height: 5'10'' -&gt; 5'10'' (no surprise there...)

I don't own a scale, so I occasionally weighed myself in the locker room. The values are approximate. I gained a few pounds over Spring break, so I was actually a bit lower in BF at the end of the recomp. I snapped [these](http://imgur.com/a/iI7GR) the last day of the recomp before going home and pigging out.

If you have any questions feel free to ask! I switched to a -30/+10 cut today and changed my routine to RPT. I plan on following it all through the Summer. I'll be sure to keep you guys up to date on my progress!

**Edit:** So, I just weighed myself this morning and it came out to 161.4 lbs. Guess I weigh a lot less than I thought I did.

For those of you who might be interested, [here are some pics](http://imgur.com/a/gwD3T) of me before starting SS in September.

I've been lifting on and off over the years with varying results. Last time I was in good shape was in 2005-2009 until I finished my service in the Army. Then came the university, and I started to neglect my body. I would go to the gym with few months of adherence here and there. Until i started lifting again in mid-February 2012 I hadn't been at the gym for almost a year, and my diet sucked balls. I felt weak and fat and finally mustered up to start getting back in shape. 
I followed a high-volume program from mid February until mid-April. It was good, but tough to adhere to five days a week, and after 2 months I started searching for alternatives.

Then I discovered Leangains and Reverse pyramid training, and thought I'd give it a shot after reading up extensively on it.

I am not entirely where I want to be, but I am quite happy with the progress I have made so far.  I still want to get leaner, and then pack on some more muscle.



My body-stats:

**Before:**

* Height: 173 cm (5 feet 8 inches) 
* Weight: 74kg (163 lbs) 
* BF: 15-20%?

[Side](http://i.imgur.com/OLFl2.jpg)



* Height: 173 cm (5 feet 8 inches 
* Weight: 70 kg (154 lbs) 
* BF: 10-12% ? 



My lifts are (1 RM included, except for the ones where I only have the top set stats):

* **DL:** 133 (293 lbs) X 1 
* **Bench:** 100 kg (220 lbs) X 1 
* **Squat:** 124 kg (273 lbs)X 1 
* **OHP:** 65 kg (143 lbs)X 1 
* **Chins:** BW + 25 kg (55 lbs) X 6 
* **Dips:** BW + 35 kg (77 lbs) X 8 


The stats from above are from my RPT lifts. The rest of the stats I have I don't think are relevant, since they're just ""normal"" lifts. 

Most of my lifts have gone up 20-25 kg (30 - 50 lbs) over the past six weeks, but I'm starting to stall at most lifts now. That's probably because of where I'm getting to with the cut.  

I work out 3 times a week:

REPS X SETS 

**Monday:**

* Squat RPT 5-8 X 3
* Overhead press 8X3
* Leg extension 8 X 3
* Calf raises 8 X 3
* Leg curls 8 X 3


**Wednesday:**

* Bench press RPT 5-8 X 3 
* Weighted dips RPT 8 - 12 X 3
* Incline DB press 8 X 2
* DB skull-crushers  8 X 2


**Friday:**

* Dead lift RPT 3-5 X 2
* Chins ups RPT 6-8 X 3
* Pendlay Row 8 X 3
* One arm row 8 X 3 






My diet for the last 6 weeks while I've followed LG is:

Fasted training on 12 g aminoacids (haven't bought BCAA's yet, but plan on doing it) 

Split:

+10/-30 

3g protein/lb BW

REST: 25 c /75 f and Workout: 75 c /25 f
(but modified so that I only got 30 g of fat on training days, and only 40-60 g of carbs on rest days.) 

I'm considering a recomp soon, but that depends on what you guys think? Recomp now, or do the cut until July and reach 8-9% BF? 

Anyway, just thought I'd share this stuff with you guys, and tell you that I'm happy I finally discovered Intermittent Fasting. I don't think I'll ever switch back to eating ""normally"".

* Burr grinder ($40-90)
* Food Scale ($20... who are we kidding, I *know* you already have this!)

Follow the Aeropress instructions (or mine: preheated cup, brew inverted with 25g coffee, fill that bitch all the way with 180F water, stir, wait a fart,  press with loving tenderness, just a dash of hot water on top of the cup).

I am 5'6'' and I lost about 100 pounds over the past few years, which put me at 175. After I graduated college and moved back in with my parents for the summer, old eating habits hit me again and I ballooned back up to 200. I decided to do LG because I read Martin's blog pretty often because I like his scientific approach to body composition. 

I decided on a -10/-30 cut, and I have followed it pretty well. Obviously life has happened in these 10 weeks, there were alcohol binges(~once a week) and overeating(once every few weeks). However, 10 weeks in, all my lifts have improved significantly (I hadn't been doing squats or deads before LG though, but I had done bench and I am at my max bench ever) and I am down 10 pounds. I'll let you guys know what's up in another 10 weeks. Feel free to ask me anything about my diet.

I've been following a modified starting strength program that a friend set up for me. Three workouts a week, alternating A and B.

Most exercises are 3 * 5. Deadlifts are 1 set only, and chins are two sets.

I've moved to reverse pyramid training for most of these exercises now. Five reps at the listed weight, then 6 at -110% and 7 at -120%. 

Unfortunately, I've had to stop squats and deadlifts. Strained a hamstring trying brazilian jiu-jitsu. It's still healing. 

I've added in some accessory exercises while I wait to restart those. Progress remains steady. 

I can't remember the last time I saw abs. My scale weight has dropped from 150 to 144. My high school weight was 138, and I was pretty strong. I may end up there again.

###Pictures
----

I've been doing intermittant fasting since early 2011, and it produced progress. Leangains since May 2. Final front picture is July 11. The final back picture is from a couple of weeks ago.

**July 11th:** [Front](http://imgur.com/G84mD) [Back](http://imgur.com/4PHx9)



###Workouts
----

**Workout A:** Squats, Bench Press, Deadlift, Chin-ups

**Workout B:** Squats, Overhead Press, Pendlay Row

As I mentioned, I've had to cut out the squats and deadlifts while my hamstring heals. Have added in some accessory exercises. Progress continues.

Working time around 12 or 1. 10g BCAA before leaving home. i slowly drink 30g of whey protein and 5g of L-glutamine during the workout.

###Progress
----

**Scale Weight:** 151 --&gt; 144    (I'm 5'6"")

**Squats:** 165 --&gt; 222.5   (Had to stop June 15th)

**Deadlift:** 185 --&gt; 209.5 (Had to stop June 15th. I kept deadlift weight low for a while to improve form)

**Bench press:** 115 --&gt; 152

**Chin-ups:** Bodyweight (152) --&gt; Bodyweight (146) + 37.5 == 183.5

**Overhead Press:** 90 --&gt; 110

**Pendlay Row:** 65 --&gt; 132 (Weight was artificially low to learn form at first)

-----
**Edit:** Added Diet and tracking sections
----


###Diet
----

As I mentioned in the comments, I've been extremely loose with my macros. I don't even know how many calories I'm eating. I eat more carbs on workout days, and more fat on rest days. Higher calories on workout days. 

Two things helped me succeed at this despite not focussing on the numbers:

* I spend four days tracking everything I ate. That gave me a pretty good intuitive sense of how much protein and how many calories I was getting.
* I stopped eating sugar and junk food. You *can* eat junk and succeed at leangains, but you need to be tighter on your macros than I was.

**Main Foods**

I pretty much eat the same thing each workout and rest day. 

Workout days: 400g of smoked salmon, 1 package of rice crackers, berries and cottage cheese, vegetables, sauerkraut, kimchee and kombucha. Sometimes skim milk. Whey protein and l-glutamine post workout.

Rest Days: 4 eggs, one of the following: liver, ground beef, chicken, cottage cheese, berries, vegetables, sauerkraut, kimchee and often kombucha. Sometimes whey protein if I didn't get enough protein.

Might be too much smoked salmon...but hey, it's working. A local grocer sells it for a very good price. 

I tried casein, my body seems to hate it. Might be the additives, I'm going to try some unflavored casein soon.

###Tracking
----

I do track a few things that have really helped. 

* Scale Weight
* Weight lifted + reps + subjective measures such as strain

If scale weight is going down and weight lifted it going up, I'm on the right track. 

I found that simply tracking my scale weight each day helped accelerate losses. Likewise, tracking my protein for four days made me realize I wasn't getting enough, and made me progress faster.",,False,,t5_2saqe,1342186761.0,,,True,t3_wgtj1,http://www.reddit.com/r/leangains/comments/wgtj1/recomp_two_month_progress/,
1375377027.0,41,self.leangains,1ji75b,"LG, ESE, Combining Diets, Fasting, and Alcohol",47,6,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/leangains/comments/1ji75b/lg_ese_combining_diets_fasting_and_alcohol/,"So, I've seen a lot of posts talking about combining LG and ESE, or asking about alcohol, and I thought I would point out a couple of things that may not be obvious. I don't consider myself an LG expert (I followed it for two years, up until a month ago, and it truly works), but I believe I can speak to fasting and Eat Stop Eat with more authority. I have turned a lot of people onto LG and/or ESE at various points over the past four years because they saw that what I was doing was working.

You're welcome to dismiss all of this, and it won't be very revelatory for those of you who are into LG, know what you're doing and why, etc. Yes, it is a wall of text.

**1. Combining LG and ESE**

This can be a struggle over a long term and, unless you're really hitting your macros and calorie goals on a weekly basis, you can mess yourself up. I have seen it happen several ways, but a couple examples:

* **LG @ -40/-20 with two fasted days**: this violates the inherent principles of both plans, because LG is about slow recomposition (not fast fat loss) and ESE is about lifestyle changes that allow you to obsess less about food. The huge calorie drop you're going for might work or it might make you weaker, frustrate you, cause malnutrition, etc.

* **LG 5 days a week and ESE 2 days per week**: this is different from the first example because I'm assuming you're at maintenance at least one day a week. They take their post-workout meal (say, at 6 PM,  ~800+ calories) then go 24 hours. They have another huge meal at 7 PM the next day (~800+ calories) and resume normal eating, which may be 600-1200 more calories (depending on what they're doing). Do the math. You have not cut out a full day's worth of calories. You've eliminated the back end of your LG feeding window on the first day (which Martin never accounted for because it's not what he recommends) AND you've just moved your big meal of the day back an hour. **See below for how ESE should work.**

* **TL;DR**: *You CAN combine LG and ESE, but you have to be meticulous and remember: neither BP nor MB created these programs to work together.*

**2. Confusing LG with a 16/8 calorie restriction**

I'm not the first to point this out in this forum, but it bears repeating. Part of LG is the heavy, compound lifts. Martin's whole damn theory is built around the concept of getting big AND lean, not just getting lean. If you're following 16/8 with P90X or Insanity or Turbulence Training or anything that is not *heavy, compound lifts* possibly with some assistance work, you're not doing LG. You will likely get more help from /r/Fitness or /r/fasting! The fasted window is not specifically about caloric restriction, it's about timing your eating to make the most of your workouts. MB went into the science of it, so no point in me repeating his work, but it's there, and it isn't just about caloric restriction (which is fine... do a 16/8 with p90X!)

* **TL;DR**: *LG is not only about caloric restriction... the heavy lifting is part of the theory. 16/8 is a different issue.*

**3. Alcohol &amp; LG**

I love beer and bourbon. I spent much of my 20s proving it. And when I started following ESE and LG, I didn't see the problem because I got lean and I looked good. Then I went to a doctor and he gave me a stack of medical essays to read to convince me. You can find most of this for yourself (actually, some of the basic, popular reference sources online have very detailed and sourced information), but some highlights that changed my habits:

* alcohol messes up absorption of nutrients, so if you're drinking several nights per week and only not drinking during the ESE fast, you're blocking many of the things you need and not replenishing your body
* alcohol increases iron absorption... this was a big one that my doctor and I discussed at length. If I'm following a high protein (lots o' meat) diet, then I'm already taking in a lot of iron. If I'm downing drinks too, I'm damaging my liver beyond just the alcohol (if you've noticed dark stools after a night of drinking and eating a lot of meat, this *could* be a sign... but it could also be something else.)
* if you count alcohol as calories and STILL staying below maintenance (it's possible, I did it), then you're definitely not giving yourself much to work with... an 1800 calorie day with 800 calories from alcohol means you only took in 1000 usable calories

The takeaway is that fasting can hurt you if you go for the alcohol during your fed window. I believe Martin found a way around this (back when he was just dropping knowledge bombs and being a god on his site). I'm not saying I don't drink. I have a dark beer or a bourbon two-three nights, and maybe a couple more on a Saturday night. If you don't want to cut down like that, it's your business. I just wanted to share, especially the bit about how fasting and alcohol can be dangerous.

* **TL;DR**: *drink daily and heavily if you must, but if you also fast, the piper will require more payment than calories counted.*

**4) Eat Stop Eat Misconceptions**

enough people use a 24-hour fast (and I've been following ESE since the first edition) that I thought I would share some thoughts (some of which I shared in another post here recently). If you're going to follow ESE, you should buy the damn book and read it. Yes, the concept is simple. **However, like iPhone contracts, LeanGains, evolution, and communism, if you don't actually read what the motherfucker wrote and only go by what you've heard, you're going to have the wrong idea.** Brad put a lot of work (he's up to about 300+ sources now) into his theory. He's refined it quite a bit. He's offering a deal now where he lays out how he eats, by the way. I'm a big fan of the guy because, other than Martin, he's the only person I know who has not changed their tune in the six years or so that I've been following fitness online. Anyway, Eat Stop Eat is a 24 hour break from eating. Then you **resume eating as you normally would**. You don't move your dinner back on the second night so that you can still have it. If you finish eating at 6 PM, start your fast , and go 24-hours (skipping dessert, breakfast, lunch), ESE assumes you won't have a large dinner at 7 PM- just the dessert you'd normally have at 9 PM. BP is very clear about this. Will you lose weight if you do have a dinner the second night? Yes. But you won't lose as quickly and you'll stall eventually and you'll be missing the point.

* **TL;DR**: *ESE is 24 hours of fasting, then resumption of normal eating... if you have a big dinner outside of the normal time because ""it's been 24 hours"", you're doing it less effectively than you otherwise could.*


**TL;DR**: You can combine LG &amp; ESE, but it takes thought, experimentation, and attention to the methods both employ. LG is not necessarily caloric restriction and requires heavy, compound lifts. Fasting and frequent, heavy (&gt;2 drinks) alcohol use can cause issues with nutrient absorption and may increase absorption of iron, causing liver problems. ESE is not just ""stop eating for 24 hours twice a week"" if you want to do it effectively... buy the damn book.

I'm done. I know it's long and I'm sure the formatting could be better. I also know (and forewarned you) that this won't be informative for someone who has been doing LG and/or ESE the right way for a while.

I started off doing SS 8 months ago when I was around 190 but I never took progress pics of those, I built up to a 325 squat and a 315 DL before I decided to switch to calisthenics, the movement and incredible strength really allured me. I mainly followed Coach Sommer's book GymnasticBodies and extensive research within the forums along with a little help from /r/bodyweightfitness and implemented squat / DL training once a week. I worked out 5x a week while also doing Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu 3x a week. 

Some feats include:

4s support hold rings turned in ---&gt; 30s support hold RTO

5s lsit tuck --&gt; 45s L-sit on parallettes


3x4 chinups ---&gt; 3x7 30lb chinups

10 second wall hs ---&gt; avg 16s freestanding hs

Full hamstring compression, can do full 3x8 Hanging v-ups on my stall-bar

elbow lever and working on 1 armed elbow lever hand assisted
I do a lot of band stretching for shoulder health along with scapular mobilization with bands all provided by Ido Portal.

I have been dealing with a left shoulder problem for the last 4 months so my progress isn't as high as it should be. This is because I can't externally rotate my arm due to fluid in my bicep tendon, this coupled with the nerve impingement I acquired 2 months ago causing me to get shooting pains in awkward elbow positions and I can't even use a pronated grip, this has really staggered my progress. Also was a 1/2 inch away from full splits 4 days ago and got excited deciding to push too hard and stretched out a hamstring muscle in my abductor, my physiotherapist said it'll be 4-8 weeks until it's back to normal, doing a series of exercises to lengthen the process. I break easily. 

My diet consisted of 

WO Days: 3400 calories / 500g carbs / 50g of fat 

Rest days: 2300 / 70g of carbs / 130g of fat 

My eating phase was 2-10 and was pretty strict about the foods I ate, mainly eating lots of chicken and rice and stir-fries along with some leangains meals I have snatched from various websites.

The information I've learnt from reading about here has been so useful, this is a great subreddit. 
Sorry if people feel this is an inappropriate post but I thought I could encourage others who are undecided about doing leangains and share my experience.

I had been steadily losing weight for the last 3 years or so by trying to cut down my portion size and eat healthier more wholesome foods. I also tried to drastically cut down on fizzy drinks/chocolates.

I then ran the Dublin Half Marathon in September and got to around 81kg (not a very good muscular frame though) but then put on a bit more weight until I found out about LG on 17th of November.
Then did LG with SS for about 9 weeks and then RPT for the last bit (I had previous lifting experience)

TLDR: So basically I was always a fat kid and went from my heaviest which was around 100kg/220lbs and XL t shirts as a teenager to 85kg  before this LG cut to 79kg/174lbs currently!

There would of course e a basic wizard setup to generate your BMR and what not, but the primary functions will be tracking.

My thinking is that I will create it as a freely accessible web site, but then build a mobile app that costs money.

I want to share with you all, my   [progress!](http://imgur.com/a/mvSAy) with leangains.
First of all, before starting doing exercises and workouts I used to weight around 130 lbs (I am 5'9 height...)

after two years of ""working out"" and ""eating properly"" I gained around 50 lbs of fat a maybe a bit of muscle doing the basic bodybuilding split routine that the average Joe does...

When I realized that most of the weight I gained was fat, I decided that I wanted to cut and start training the real way. No more fuckarounditis. I stumbled upon LG, and after some reading, I started doing the fasting and also working out using the Reverse Pyramid method that Martin suggests on his site.

Basically, I eat around 2400 calories on training days, and around 1500 calories on rest days. 

The progress is really slow but noticeable. 

Sometimes I think I'm not eating enough so my strenght is decreasing.
For example, by July my Deadlifts were at 315lbs at 3 reps. Now I can  barely hit 300lbs. I eat more so that I can get the strenght back but my cutting stalls.. and I haven't really noticed any difference in BF between July and August.

Right now I feel that I want to change my routine and workout everyday for five days a week, but ths routine doesn't work with LG since you need the rest days for carb cycling and fat burning.

Anyways, I'll see how it goes this month.

These are my stats comparison between February and now:

Album here if you missed my first link http://imgur.com/a/mvSAy

February  2012

Weight: 180 lbs

bench       165lbs for 8 reps

1362384837.0,37,self.leangains,19mncu,MyFitnessPal (MFP) Full Week/7 Day Custom Cals+Macros script (lean gains friendly),41,4,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/leangains/comments/19mncu/myfitnesspal_mfp_full_week7_day_custom_calsmacros/,"Hi all,

Based very heavily on the excellent work (MFP lean gains script) by Xablor (http://www.reddit.com/r/leangains/comments/ny4km/i_made_myfitnesspal_work_with_lg_testers_please/), I've developed an MFP script that allows you to specify custom Calories + Macro Ratios for EACH day of the week (M,T,W,Th,F,Sa,Su). 

And, for any days that you don't define custom calories/macros for, the script will utililse its Default day setting (the cals/macros for which you must also define). This method basically allows you to customise only your training days Cals/Macros (individually!), and have the Default Cals/Macros apply on any days that you have not defined (eg: Rest Days) if you prefer.

Note: Using the Default day is OPTIONAL and was only intended to save time for those people whose rest day calories/macros are consistent through the week. If you prefer, you may define Cals/Macros for every single day (of the week)! :-)

I've done a bit of testing of this script and it worked fine for me. :-)
That said, please bear in mind that I'm not a coder, so there might be errors and I won't be supporting this script. It's yours to use/mod as you see fit. Please give credit however (and don't forget that this was Xablor's work to start with, I only modded it).

Zip file containing the script and example data file are located here: http://www.filedropper.com/myfitnesspal7daymacroscript

Instructions:

1. Inside the file ""macros-7d.txt"", create headers for each day of the week [Sunday], [Monday], [Tuesday], etc. that you want/have specific macro requirements. (As shown in the included .txt, I've defined data for every day)
2. Under the [Default] header input the macros that you will use for non custom days (eg: Rest days). For any day that you do not define macros for, the [Default] header cal/macro values will be used.
4. If you have defined EVERY day, Default values will never get loaded. But PLEASE LEAVE IT there.
5. You MUST delete days (ie: delete the header ""[Monday]"", for example, and associated cal/macro data) for those days you prefer to use Default macro data for.
5. Using the Default header will help those people who only customise their macros for a few of the days of the week. For those who do customise all 7 days, the default header is not necessary - but PLEASE LEAVE IT THERE, as it might be useful in case you decide to cut down on custom days in future and forget that it's a usable feature/option.
6. Protein/Fat/Carb percentages can only be a multiple of 5 (eg: 5, 20, 55, 70, etc. Not 23, 31, 78, etc)
7. Enjoy.

WARNING: The download is a script file and data file ONLY! If you are using Python on your PC/device then the scripts should be easy to get working (see Xablor's thread for some help). I apologise, but I have NO IDEA how to get this working as an executable/app. :( sorry. Maybe someone else can help here?

FYI: I'm using Tasker+SL4A on my Android phone (Galaxy S3) to run this script at 00:01 AM each day, so that my Cals+Macros are always up to date. (Instructions: http://tasker.wikidot.com/sl4a). The script must be in SL4 scripts directory, the .txt must be in the SL4 main directory.

Now if only someone could figure out how to make MFP ignore my Fitbit's ""Calories earned from exercise"" then this would be complete :p

This is my first reddit post - apologies in advance if I've messed anything up.

Thanks and happy customising.

This story is to get two points across:

a.) Even if you mess up/gain weight/whatever reason that you fall off the wagon - you **CAN** get on again.

b.) LG works.  Amazingly well (as if most of us didn't know this already).

There are a few pics here.  

First, December 2010 (185 pounds).  I was heavy (I wouldn't say obese, but overweight works).  I figured it was time to do something about that - so I did what I'd imagine a lot of people do when they know nothing: P90x.  

http://i.imgur.com/pM8Ek.jpg

After I finished P90x, I was hooked.  Working out 5-6 days a week with 5-6 meals a day was the way of life I'd chosen.  I got down to ~165 pounds at this point.  It was then that my goal for 2011 was set: ** to see my abs**

http://i.imgur.com/Ri1ik.jpg

So.....after P90x I was on the Beachbody Bandwagon....I did P90x again, did Insanity, and stuck in a calorie deficit the whole time....I made the same mistake others do when seeing the people that got great results from these programs: forgot that *if there is no muscle there in the first place (under the fat), it won't be there once the fat is taken off*  Here's me in December 2010 at 150 pounds.

http://i.imgur.com/JQvFl.jpg

So....what happens when you lose that much weight and don't get the results you want (all the while people are telling you you're way too skinny)?  You start to believe what they're saying....and you eat. I ate everything I saw (and of course with all the shit food, I had no motivation to exercise.   At all.  Here's me in March (back to ~170 pounds).

http://i.imgur.com/2xWpN.jpg

And in early April......at ~185 pounds.

So....at this point...summer is coming up and I swear...there is nothing like the disappointment I felt knowing that I wanted abs, but had put so much fat on instead.  A whole year's progress....gone.  I decided I was going to do something about this.  I took the next few weeks PSMF'ing (which I completely regret in retrospect) and got to the mid 170's....

**Enter Andy Morgan**  I had read about LG for months and I wanted to see what all the fuss was about.  I needed someone to get me on track (because I clearly couldn't do it on my own) so I emailed Andy.  From day one, he was great....he was straight to the point, and very forward with everything.  

This is my starting picture I sent to him on May 12, 2012:

http://i.imgur.com/kuRuc.jpg

Needless to say - LG went against everything I learned in 2011.  In 2011, I cancelled plans often and barely did anything because I had to stick to my rigorous eating plan....over the past few months I've gone on plenty of trips (including a week long family vacation where I had VERY little choice over what I ate...and no weights) and Andy always had helpful suggestions for me.  His emails were always optimistic, even though it took me a couple of months to figure out why.

Here's the final picture I sent him on August 5, 2012:

http://i.imgur.com/NzJmq.jpg

After spending a year looking for abs....here they are.  During a cut.  Better progress than the whole year of 2011 in months.  With several out of town weekends.  Eating two meals a day.  It's still hard for me to believe...but it worked.  My lifts stayed consistent (while some even went up) **AND** I even had lower back issues which took DL's and Squats out of my routine for the last half of the 12 week period.  

Here's a pic from last week (at ~160 pounds):

http://i.imgur.com/9HcHQ.jpg

I know this is a lot of text....but if you take nothing else from this, please take my original two points with you:

a.) If you mess up,  you **CAN** find your way back with a little discipline, and good instruction.

b.) **Andy Morgan at rippedbody.jp knows what he's doing.**  I had my doubts at first....even well into the first month when he'd say things like *""Look forward to seeing what the next few weeks brings.""*, but I was obviously proven wrong.  I can't recommend him enough.

Now....time to slow bulk.  Will update in a few months!  Good luck everyone.

Edit: If this seems like a big push for Andy's services, you've gotten the wrong idea. It's more that he helped me get to where I wanted to be (even though it seemed impossible) because I knew I couldn't do it alone...and to say I'm impressed is an understatement.

I've been fasting for years, and while I understand the logic behind having your PWO meal your largest, I find that it does not work for me. Instead I tend to eat a bit of fruit (berries usually), 2-4 eggs, a bit of lean protein (salmon), and a brick ton of veggies (~1 lb) [in take increased/decreased depending on hunger levels, etc].

This tends to happen around 4-6pm (post-workout). My biggest meal usually is then around 9pm, and can easily become 1000+ calories.

In terms of maximum efficacy, it is possible I am losing some by not having my largest meal after my workout. But in terms of sanity and sustainability, it works best for me.

Again - this is my case. From working out to eating habits to the feeding window, LG itself should be treated as guidelines. 

Good guidelines yes, but not strict gospel. People have been getting big/strong/cut/ripped/(insert your desired adjective here) for years.

I'm pretty darn skinny as it is, coupled with a rather poor strength foundation. It seems to me that I should transition to a slow bulk already and improve the main lifts.

I'm male, 5'9, born in Sri Lanka, living in USA and as the title states, I'm here to share my fitness journey **from bro science to the eventual discovery of Leangains**. Hopefully it will help people who are considering taking up Leangains a little more encouragement and answer questions those currently practicing may have. **Please go ahead and ask if you have any particular questions**. I'm just an out of shape, chubby engineering student turned strength enthusiast so all the information that follows is through personal experience and not professional learning. Just thought I'd throw that out there. Also I don't have any ""before"" pictures that I took specifically for monitoring purposes which I truly regret but I did scrounge up some social pics of myself. I hope you guys find this post informative.    

* **Fall of 2010** 

[**Here's a picture of myself at 185 lbs**](http://imgur.com/zKXtf). This was the start of my freshmen semester. Overweight, weak and tired all the time. Ate what ever I wanted, when ever I wanted.

* **Fall of 2011**

[**Me after a year at 155 lbs**](http://imgur.com/rQmz9) of finally controlling my diet and working out. Until this point I was still using bro-science logic. Small meals 7 times a day, protein shake right after i worked out.. the whole 9 yards. The only reason **I lost weight is because of the reduction in my caloric intake** which is just basic thermodynamics. **Loose weight = fewer calories (energy)**.

Middle of the semester **I got really interested in power lifting** so decided to go on a bulk upto **175 lbs**. This was a traditional bulk where I basically ate what ever I could. I did see strength gains but also a lot of fat gain. I bulked till January of 2012 at which point I decided to go on a cut. 

* **January 2012 : Discovery of Leangains**

One of my friends who's also a power lifting enthusiast introduced me to Leangains and. I loved it. Eating big meals a couple times a day was great. I didn't have to carry around little tupper ware bowls any more so I can eat every 2 hours and **being on an empty stomach during the morning hours made me feel light and active**. In about 3 months **I cut down to 164 lbs using a -40/+30 split, Reverse Pyramid Training and making sure I did good macro cycling.** At 164 lbs my lifts started to suffer and summer was only a few weeks away so I wanted to go back on a bulk as I was going to just be lifting and relaxing when I went home for the summer.

* **May - August 2012** 

Summer consisted of a **Leangains bulk** but it was a lot less meticulous. I did little to no calorie counting. I measured my caloric intake with my lifts. If my lifts were getting harder, I would just eat more. It's not a very accurate and calculated way of doing it but the reason I did that was because in Sri lanka, figuring out caloric values of local foods is damn near impossible.

* **Fall of 2012**

[**Here are a few pictures of myself now.**](http://imgur.com/a/nleJw). I am still using leangains 16/8 hour fasted-fed split and my rough calorie measuring technique. I realize that I'm not as lean as most progress pics on here but that's not really what I'm going for. It took me about a year of actually counting calories to get to the point where I can eye ball the ammount of food I need. The only supplement I use right now is **Creatine** and I can't recommend it enough. I don't have any protein powders, pre-workouts etc. **Real food goes a long way**. That being said, here are what my lifts have been looking like since april 2012. 

[**Strength and weight progression from April 2012**](http://imgur.com/a/MOx4b)

Part of the test was liver/kidney/pancreatic testing. I also had to do a glucose test where you fast and drink that orange syrup crap.

Before the glucose test you are to fast for minimum 10 hours.  I wound up fasting for 17 hours. During the fast I  played hockey and did a 1.5 hour hike (during the fast).

I did all my blood work and a few things came back out of whack.  Urea and Bicarbonate... figured so much, waste product from exercise and lactic acid release.

My ALT (primary liver function)came back fine, but my AST was slightly elevated.

What was really crazy was my Bilirubin (turned over red blood cells) came back nearly double.  38 (normal is sub 20).  My blood work came back saying I was in early levels of Jaundais.

I called my DR and he wanted me to get a Liver/Gall Bladder ultrasound.  I had done some reading, and found out fasting can actually raise Bilirubin. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1364954/)

Also my AST levels were slightly elevated, they weren't out of control, I also found this study stating that exercise raises AST levels. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2291230/)

I told the DR, I suspect it was from fasting, and he said no.  So I asked to redo the test.  He gave me a requisition and told me to wait a few weeks. I waited 5 days.

I stopped fasting on Wednesday of last week and ate like a normal person for 5 days.  Last night I ate a pizza super late at night to make sure I had plenty of calories to keep me from getting into any sort of fasted state.  

Redid the test today, Bilirubin is now 21, down from 38.  Only 1 above what is considered normal.  I never stopped working out but my AST even dropped a point.

So this post has a few purposes. 

1) If you get blood work, don't freak the fuck out about your liver when your AST and bilirubin levels come back high
2) Elevated Bilirubin is actually shown to reduce coronary disease by preventing arterial hardening (http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/114/14/1476).  
3) Bilirubin is also potentially a potent antioxidant. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3029864)


If you are a geek this will probably interest you... if you just want your abs to look like a washboard, this might not... but when you get blood work done, might put your mind at ease.

Progress Pictures - Unflexed:
http://skitch.com/bryanno/ea9m6/iphoto-2
http://skitch.com/bryanno/ea9m4/iphoto-1.jpg

Starting Weight - 185-195lbs (I had spent the year before crash dieting or following things like 4 Hour Body, so my weight fluctuated in this range).

Current Weight - 160lbs

* Squat -180x8 &gt; 260x6. 
* Deadlift - 225x7 &gt; 320x8 / 375x1. 
* Bench - 110x8 &gt; 145x12.

I know my numbers aren't wildly impressive and I don't have striking abs, but I'd like to share what I've learned.

**What I've Learned:**

1. If you're new to all of this, it's dangerous to read through the internet and try to apply any of the discussions or ideas to yourself. You're a beginner and most of what is discussed at length applies more to intermediate and above. Start simple and be consistent.
2. Stick with everything you try for at least 3 months. As you get a better understanding of what works for you and moreso what you enjoy the most, you'll learn how to tweak parts of your plan, but you have to be patient. I say this as someone who could be a lot more lean or more muscular but instead I flip flopped every time I saw the scale go up or felt my strength decrease.
3. Not every principle will work for you. IF and the macro splits are great, but you might find you hate life with lower carb rest days. The best part of IF for me is not feeling hungry all the time and eating awesome meals, everything else is only is good as it makes you feel. Martin came up with all of this because eating 6 meals a day didn't work for him any more. Also, if you don't follow what's listed, you're not doing a ""modified"" version. You're doing your own thing. That's well and good but in the first year, remember the words of Ygritte, ""You know nothing"". Absorb, learn, progress.
4. Measure, record, and document. Take pictures, measurements, and record your workouts consistently. If you performed like crap, try to identify why. Not enough sleep? Skipped your coffee? Keep track of this stuff as it will help you improve and also help you feel better if you just couldn't keep up one day at the gym.
5. Find a buddy (and honestly, I'm here for anyone who wants to talk). Find someone who has similar progress as you or similar progress to what you want. Do you know how much it helped talking with people about the skin over my belly button? I am so insecure about the fat and extra skin around there but hearing that I'm not the only one, especially for people who are super lean now, really made me not feel insane. You're not alone.
6. Take time to rest, recharge, enjoy life, and also find your maintenance. In between different 3+ month goals it's not a bad idea to take 1-2 weeks and just figure out what your maintenance calories are. Sometimes I see the most weight loss progress in those two weeks. Lyle Mcdonald has an article on this too.
7. Your mental health is as important as your physical health. I currently pull my shirt up and look at my stomach every time I pass a mirror. I weigh myself daily if there's a scale around. Is this healthy? No freaking way. Talk to somebody about it. My wife hits me if she sees me doing this and I'm thankful she does, but it's gonna be a long time before I stop doing this. And also, like I won't want to do it more when I'm super ripped? Don't be a mental case like me, and if you already are, let's talk it out.
8. And finally, don't push your luck. Sure, -30/-10 works for some, maybe even most, but if you don't feel awesome, don't do it. Believe me, nobody wants a flat stomach more than me, but this is about living a healthier and sexier life. Abs are useless if you feel and look deflated. THAT'S JUST MY EXPERIENCE and I'm not saying don't do it, but pry yourself away from the idea that if you were making progress on -20/0 then surely -30/-10 means you'll make DOUBLE the progress.

I am just an average joe. I'm not ripped yet. I don't have a ton of muscle mass. But I'm also no longer the kid who skipped gym class because it was the day they made you run a mile. I'm the guy who is DYING to deadlift 405lbs this month so I can say that I went from lifting 225lbs (1.15xbw) for 7 to 405lbs (2.5xbw) for 1 in my first year of lifting.",,False,,t5_2saqe,1350244638.0,,,True,t3_11h2db,http://www.reddit.com/r/leangains/comments/11h2db/one_year_progress_what_ive_learned/,

Any way sorry to be long winded but here are my tips and tricks that i believe helped me 

Believe it or not this is a -30/-10 and even lower sometimes ....i log everything i eat drink on myfitnesspal and i drink over a gallon of water a day

Work out days 16/8 
Non workout 20/4 


Things i eat 
Fasted -no eating just 
Monster Zero energy drinks  and redbulls Zero 
Lots of water ...lots 

Feasting 
* Steak with a side of steak 
* All other kinds of meats (think this goes without saying)
* Lots of peppers 
* Dannon lite and fit Greek ..lots of it 
* Greek yougert plain 
* Casesin and Whey protien shakes with ice Silk unsweetened almond vanilla milk (30 cals no carbs) 
* Rice cakes with Natty Pb 
* Sweet potato fries (cant remember the brand but low fat) 
* Whole grain cereals 
* Quinoa w/ hot rotel 
* Bacon /turkey bacon on both days 
* LOTS of Avacados ...there expensive but dammit they are awesome 
* Cottage cheese with rasberries and blueberries on top (4% rest days 1% workout days) 

and a little bit of IIFYM 

Condiments 
* My own special sauce ...mashed avacados mixed with greek yougert and siracha .....best ever IMO 
* A1 - how steak is done 
* lots of other hot sauces lol 
* Ketchup on occasion (with my sweet tator fries) 


Supplements 
* Thermogenic containing yohimbe every 2 hours fasted  (finally got some yohimbe coming this week and will be taking this instead soon) 
* Creatine 
* Fish oil 




Anyway i will update this if people have questions ...i know im still a long way from ""ripped"" but i was just excited and wanted to share with the community that helped me out so much 


Also i DEFIANTLY recommend reading ""Eat stop eat"" ""The Stubborn Fat Solution"" and ""The ultimate diet 2.0"" to get a better understanding of how your body works 


Edit ....
Well finally lost some strength in bench .. had to get a spotter for my last reps :(  ....it just felt heavy ...now it could have been because I was an idiot and bored at work so I went and did pushups to failure (Addicted to the pump lull) on Friday and didn't refill my glycogen or just compromised my power day by fatigue ....but I woke up today and had a big Whoosh .. didn't weigh myself after my workout but I wouldn't doubt if I lost 3-5 lb just last night ...I'm not kidding I will post pictures soon ... but think I was holding a lot of water in the above pictures and will probly switch to a -20/+10-20 for this week to be safe ...can't loose those gainz hahaha 
Interestingly enough though my deadlifts felt light and I did up the lb by 30 and added reps to my leg press as well ... still got a little stubborn fat but I'm excited to see what a week or two of a small deficit will bring!!! 
Will post pics tomorrow when I get time to illustrate the whoosh 
Ok the last 3 pictures are post whoosh .. http://imgur.com/a/jT3ei

This study seems relevant here. 

http://www.amjmed.com/article/S0002-9343(13)00200-3/fulltext

&gt; Background

&gt;There are limited data regarding the relationship between cannabinoids and metabolic processes. Epidemiologic studies have found lower prevalence rates of obesity and diabetes mellitus in marijuana users compared with people who have never used marijuana, suggesting a relationship between cannabinoids and peripheral metabolic processes. To date, no study has investigated the relationship between marijuana use and fasting insulin, glucose, and insulin resistance.

&gt;Methods

&gt;We included 4657 adult men and women from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 2005 to 2010. Marijuana use was assessed by self-report in a private room. Fasting insulin and glucose were measured via blood samples after a 9-hour fast, and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was calculated to evaluate insulin resistance. Associations were estimated using multiple linear regression, accounting for survey design and adjusting for potential confounders.

&gt;Results

&gt;Of the participants in our study sample, 579 were current marijuana users and 1975 were past users. In multivariable adjusted models, current marijuana use was associated with **16% lower fasting insulin levels** (95% confidence interval [CI], −26, −6) and 17% lower HOMA-IR (95% CI, −27, −6). We found significant associations between marijuana use and smaller waist circumferences. Among current users, we found no significant dose-response.

&gt;Conclusions

&gt;We found that marijuana use was associated with lower levels of fasting insulin and HOMA-IR, and smaller waist circumference.

So I began IF last fall. For me it wasn't very difficult at all to skip morning meals, and I usually wouldn't break my fast until after I hit the gym on workout days, which was usually around 1 or 2 pm. I would have a high protein, high carb lunch, then another for dinner, and be done eating by around 8 pm, making my fast around 17 hours or so. Everything was going swimmingly until about 3 months ago, when my wife began complaining about a sour smell that seemed to emanate from me. She couldn't really place just what it smelled like (I couldn't smell a thing), other than to say it was sour and was made worse if I had a lot of coffee or had been drinking alcohol. I upped my teeth cleaning, but that didn't do anything. Whatever it was it came from inside me, and this really started to freak me out. I should say at this point that my wife was/is pregnant with our 2nd kid, and I know pregnant women can be extra sensitive to smells- after all, no one else seemed to notice this odor coming from me. But that said, I began to assume the worst- that my kidneys or liver were failing, that I was developing diabetes, etc. I'm a bit of a worrier, and no amount of showering or tooth brushing did the trick. 

So finally last week I went to the doctor. After explaining everything to him, he was a bit perplexed. Most likely the issue was wife related, as pregnant women are renowned for having sensitive noses. But the cause of the smell? He believed that my fasting would definitely be raising my ketone levels, enough so that my body could very well achieve a mild ketosis and give off this sour odor, especially in the morning (when, with coffee breath, my wife often notices the odor). 

His solution? Eat breakfast. Even just a little bit, he said, would keep me from achieving mild ketosis. Breakfast is super important, he claimed, and that putting my body in this state is rather unhealthy.

So that's that. I've since started having a small breakfast every morning (a banana and some source of protein), and so far I don't feel much of anything. The smell does seem to be less intense for my wife when I've eaten, and I can only guess that the pregnancy nose just picks up odors that may subtly be there all the time but are more pronounced by the diet.

So that's my story. Any thoughts, questions, or the like? I just thought this was interesting and wanted to share. Has anyone else experienced anything like this?

**EDIT/UPDATE:** Thanks to all for the responses! It's been great to read through all the theories and suggestions as to why the hell I smell. I think it's safe to say that the odor my (pregnant) wife detects is diet-related. A high ketone count combined with coffee breath in the morning could make the symptoms worse, but overall it may just be that she has a super-sensitive nose- after all no one else can smell it! It wouldn't hurt for me to eat more fruit and vegetables, and I'm going to pick up some liquid chlorophyll and see what that does.

An application to track food intake, sleep duration, and lifting values

## Why
I use a combination of Myfitnesspal, excel spreadsheets and mobile applications to track these things separately.
I want to manage eating, sleeping and lifting together so I can analyze my progress across the three components of building strength.
Also, myfitnesspal does not manage macro cycling very well and does not emphasize macro intake the way I would like.

## How
Build a simple web app to demonstrate the idea and see if it is useful and more valuable than the current tools available.
If all goes well, look to build native mobile applications possibly funded through Kickstarter. I'm a professional software engineer, have worked at startups and currently work at a gigantic tech company so I have the know how and experience to get this done.

## Initial Demonstration Scope

### Eat
* Calorie Counting
* Macro Breakdown and cycling
* Timing
* Recipe creator and macro breakdown

### Sleep
* Sleep log

### Lift
* Workout Log
* Workout Schedule

### Analyze
* Weight Measurements

Been doing IF for 1 year, weight lifting for 2 years.


1st year of college I picked up running to relieve stress and dropped ~15lbs., had sky high energy levels, enjoyed the giddy and sometimes transcendent feeling of a long run. I was also a vegan (gasp). I maintained what muscle mass I had despite the heretical cardio and meat-free diet.


Then I discovered (and dogmatically adhered to) the LeanGains approach, but recently have altered my training regimen to incorporate more running. It gives me more energy, a clearer mind, and seems to help me stick to my diet. I suspect it improves nutrient partitioning too. 


Anyway, I enjoy running and weight lifting and have found I don't need to ditch one or the other. ""Chronic cardio"" is very bad I agree, but ~20miles a week or less is not drastic.

 Anyone have any similar experiences? I can't be the only LGer who enjoys the childlike joy and endorphin rush of a nice run.

Happy to post details of my routine/diet if there are any questions but here is the short form:

Cals: ~2k rest days, 2500-3k workout days (keep in mind, my workout days often involve 3+ hours at the climbing gym--so 3k might be anywhere from +10% to -10%). 

Did more or less a cut with some cheat days and a few cheat weeks here and there. 


Edit: 

Workouts:

I spent a good 5-6 years lifting very consistantly before beginning to rock climb about two years ago. When I started to climb, I gave up lifting entirely for a good year and just focused on climbing. Before I stopped lifting, my #s were something like: squat 250x2, dl 285x4, bench 205x1 (sort of floundered at those numbers for a while). About a year ago, I started adding some lifting back in, mainly bench/military press to offset all of the pulling I do while climbing. Currently I bench RPT using dumbells and my last work set was 90s x 5. I will do the occasional (once ever couple weeks, if I can't climb) pulling RPT workout. I am going to start adding some leg work back in for reasons of injury prevention, but haven't done any meaningful leg work in 2 years. Basically, I have really meaty thighs and none of that muscle is helping me climb harder, so I'm trying to drop it.

In addition to climbing, I do a fair bit of running when I am not injured. I'll run 3-9 miles 3x a week or more, depending on my mood. I use myfitnesspal's calorie counter to offset those calories burned.

""Average adult male needs about 130 g/day.

""130 g is a number that gets thrown around as a general guideline for the adult, but of course it varies between individuals.

""But since brain size and energy consumption is not as variable as say body weight and BMR (i.e brain size does not vary much between individuals vs body weight/activity), I wouldn't expect this to vary greatly. Perhaps 120-150 g, we're not talking 100-300 g or something along those lines.""

In my [comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/leangains/comments/1evf81/average_adult_male_needs_about_130g_of_carbs_a/ca4eewg) I dismissed the number out of hand, and I shouldn't have. What I should have done is looked into where the number came from and why. So that's what I did.

The [2006 Institute of Medicine Dietary References Intake (DRI)](http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2006/Dietary-Reference-Intakes-Essential-Guide-Nutrient-Requirements.aspx) is where 130 grams per day comes from. The relevant chapter is Dietary Carbohydrates: Sugars and Starches. In this chapter, they mention that the Estimated Average Requirement (EAR; the amount needed to meet the nutritional requirements in half a given group of healthy individuals) is 100 grams per day. They set the  Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA; intake necessary to meet the nutritional requirements in 97-98% of healthy individuals in a given group) at 130 grams. 

The chapter on carbohydrates describe typical carbs in the diet and provides an overview on carbohydrate digestion. Here are two important quotes in the chapter:

""The requirements for carbohydrates are based on the average minimum amount of glucose that is utilized by the brain...The recommended amount also prevents ketosis, which is a rise in keto acid production in the liver to provide the brain with an alternative fuel in times of low glucose availability.""

""The amount of dietary carbohydrate that confers optimal health is unknown. The ability of humans to endure weeks of starvation after endogenous glycogen supplies are exhausted is indicative of the body's ability to survive without an exogenous supply of glucose. However, adapting to a fat and protein fuel requires considerable metabolic adjustments.""

These points inform [this excellent article by Lyle McDonald](http://www.bodyrecomposition.com/nutrition/how-many-carbohydrates-do-you-need.html). In the article, Lyle states what I hinted at in my comment: that the absolute nutritional requirement is zero carbohydrates per day - that is the body can function perfectly well on zero carbohydrates per day by relying on ketones for fuel. I know that, Lyle knows that, and Martin knows that - he even said the 130 gram number carries the assumption of avoiding ketosis. So the 100-130 gram numbers created by the IoM are not minimum requirements: they're merely guidelines for good health, fueling the brain, and avoiding ketosis. 

Although I do perfectly well in ketosis, I get that some people don't, though I'm still skeptical of those who feel ""foggy"" on rest days when they eat slightly fewer carbohydrates. In my opinion, they just feel ""hungry"" and maybe a little ""grumpy"" so they assume their brain has stopped working due to the low carbohydrates. In any case, everyone's different and I shouldn't assume a low carb brain fog is impossible. So I shouldn't have dismissed the 130 gram number out of hand. (I do, however, stand by the fact that most /r/leangains readers should adhere to the [top all-time post: KISS and Do It!](http://www.reddit.com/r/leangains/comments/13ice8/kiss_and_do_it/) and stop fucking around with the sidebar calculator when they're not shredded after 14 days of leangains dieting.) 

**tl;dr: 130 grams carbohydrates per day is the RDA set by the Institute of Medicine and it's designed as a guideline (not a minimum) for good health and avoiding ketosis.**

It doesn't help that usually they're told to just suck it up and that you must sacrifice aesthethics momentarily in order to look good later.

But a friend of mine is always gaining muscles while looking lean year round. After seeing how this is working so well I'm going to use the same approach and suggest the same to those who would rather look decent year around.

What he does is simply +500 calories to gain 5 pounds, -500 calories to lose 5 pounds (LG trainee would change this to +10/+30, -10/-30 or similar) Alternated, when he is 5 pounds heavier he starts to cut, when he is 5 pounds lighter he starts to bulk. At the end of a 4 months cycles he has gained muscles and lost fat, just like recomposition, but better than recomposition, since the bulk is a real bulk and the cut is a real cut while with recomposition you're never sure if you're really gaining or losing and might has well spin your wheel for months without realizing it.

It seems such a banal advice but many people don't think they can change their body in this way since they have been told that a bulk is useless unless done for at least 6-12 months. It sounds as if many believe that the more you're on a bulk the better your body adapts to building muscles. It's actually the opposite, the more you're on a bulk the less effective it becomes as the hormonal profiles begins to adapt. But if you think about it, on a bulk (even LG style) it's possible to gain 2-3 pounds a month. So that's 4-6 pounds in two months. There's no reason to believe this is useless unless you bulk for at least 6-12 month, as if the gains would suddenly appears at the end of a long bulk rather than happening evenly through the duration of the bulk. So really, one of the worst broscience concept out there is that you must necessarily bulk for long to gain something out of it.

My friend actually told me he started as a somewhat skinny fat guy and decided with a friend of his to join a gym and to start working out. The he came up with the thought of limiting the bulk to a certain number of pounds gained while his friends chose a more traditional approach. 5 pounds by 5 pounds he trained his way to athletic, defined and strong body in a smaller time frame than his friend needed to reach a result which is not as good.

Martin does get mentioned in a footnote.

As for the book, after you get past the initial 2/3's fluff, the actual 1/3 that consists of the workouts and diet plan are decent.

The cycling of macronutrients through-out the the 16 week program actually sounds interesting, and would work for the average guy at 18-24% bf.  Those on the extremes would still benefit, but I would personally make a couple of adjustments.

Initial 4 weeks both workout and rest days under maintenance, with rest days having a higher deficit. Starchy carbs are titrated up as the program does on. The first two weeks are almost keto, with just a small amount of post workout carbs.  Next week ups the amount on workout days. The next ups it both workout and rest day (with rest day still being fairly small). Fats are higher on rest days as both the protein and carbs are adjusted down.

Next four weeks  is still under maintenance (it's also recalculated for this session)for both days; however, there isn't as much of a deficit on workout days and there's more of a deficit on non-workout days. Carbs and protein are titrated up. Fats increased on rest day. Targeted cheat days/meals are added. 

Next four weeks (with maintenance recalced again), you are actually at a small surplus on workout days, non-workout slight deficit.  Proteins and carbs titrated up.  

Next four weeks (maintenance recalced), surplus increased on workout day, deficit increased on rest day.  Carbs titrated slightly down on rest days but are maintained on workout days.

* I've been doing a -30/-10 LG cut for 5 weeks.
* ~1,500 calorie limit on the rest days
* ~1,900 calorie limit on the w/o days
* I've been loosely following 16/8, starting my first meal around 1-2pm.

I have absolutely no problem with the -10 workout day.  It actually feels like a *very* substantial amount of food relative to the -30 rest days.

On rest days, however, by the late evening I'm always thinking about food and craving *just a little bit more food* even though I've already hit my 1,500cal limit.  This is psychologically unnerving. 

**My Solution: Increase the fasting-window by a couple hours! (switch to 18/6 - 20/4 on Rest Day!)**

I've found that if I just stave off from eating for a few more hours, I actually end up feeling *very* satisfied with just 1,500 calories by the late evening.

So I end up trying to have my first meal around 5pm instead of 1pm on the rest day and the ENTIRE SITUATION TURNS UPSIDE DOWN!  I actually end up sometimes having difficulty even getting 1,500 calories in on these types of days!  I don't even crave food!  I just naturally want to go to sleep because it's already late and I still feel fine.

By the way, I've also noticed that after my first meal, whether it's at 1pm or 5pm, my overall productivity goes DOWN THE TUBES!  So I'm actually SUPER productive all day on these 20/4 days as opposed to the 16/8 where I feel a huge slump in the afternoon.  Anyway, hope that helps!

**ETA: BY THE WAY, WOMEN SHOULD BE MORE CAUTIOUS ABOUT THIS BECAUSE MARTIN RECOMMENDS 14/10 AND LEAVES THE OPTION FOR A 16/8 FOR WOMEN SPECIFICALLY**

[http://www.leangains.com/2009/03/low-carb-again.html](http://www.leangains.com/2009/03/low-carb-again.html)

Look in the comments, Martin says:

&gt;""Average adult male needs about 130 g/day.

&gt;130 g is a number that gets thrown around as a general guideline for the adult, but of course it varies between individuals. 

&gt;But since brain size and energy consumption is not as variable as say body weight and BMR (i.e brain size does not vary much between individuals vs body weight/activity), I wouldn't expect this to vary greatly. Perhaps 120-150 g, we're not talking 100-300 g or something along those lines.

&gt;One might assume that intellectual activity plays a role here. For example, thinking/problem solving increases percentage glucose burned vs fat (fat metabolism is other wise dominant in the resting state, generally speaking), i.e the glucose/fat ratio tilts a bit more towards glucose whenever you are doing something that requires thinking or problem solving. 

&gt;And of course, this is assuming a non-ketogenic diet.""

Weird because I can't say I feel more sluggish / brain foggish on rest days when I have 40-60g of carbs. But I *do* feel awesome on training days after downing lots of oats. I'll pay more attention to this and track how I feel and function on rest days.

I would love to get some feedback from /r/leangains (and hopefully people find it useful enough to use),36,7,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/leangains/comments/100an5/i_created_my_own_nutrition_tracker_and_finally/,"So, like most of us, I found most of the nutrition trackers out there lacked features I wanted...so I ended up making my own. After months of procrastinating I finally got it to a point where others could use it.

I would love if this ended up being useful to others, so take a look and let me know what you think: http://tracker.matte.ws **finally got access to my DNS, site should be back soon, if it isn't currently** (note...I haven't thought of a name for it yet or if a name is even necessary).

Anyway, some features I added:

* Ability to specific up to seven different macro goals over a specific period of time. So for example, I have 3 different macro sets that I use (Heavy/Leg day, Light/Arm day and rest day). I could run these macros for 3 months and then create a new set to start on a specific date.

* All foods can be tracked by grams, servings, or calories. I hated using other trackers that only let you input number of servings, so that was another calculation you had to do for each food you ate.

* It tracks every nutrient. Most I've used make you pay to track anything more than calories, protein, fat, and carbs.

* Ability to add custom foods for the day. So for example, if I went out to a cookout at a friends house I could estimate I ate around 1200 calories and simply input that instead of having to create a new food to track this information.

* TDEE calculator. I added the ability to track your weight on a per day basis, so combined with your caloric intake numbers, I can calculate your estimated TDEE over a specific period of time (this is still a WIP)

I'm not sure what my BF% is...I'm going to guess around 20%. My main goal is to have a six pack, but I also enjoy having my lifts go up every week. I've noticed they only increase when I eat over maintenance, but am I screwing myself over by not going on a cut right now?

Well, life etc got in the way and this is my first update - 3 weeks later. I have continued to get a DEXA each week and taken photos to relate to the scans. The results to date can be seen in [this album](http://imgur.com/a/rJKHE#0).

Progress to date has been good - I am very pleased. My weight has not changed - as you can see my lean mass gain has more or less matched my fat loss. I don't expect this to last...!

I have not been terribly strict about rotating macros etc - from what I understand that is more important the lower your body fat gets. I'm around +20/-20 at the moment. I break the fast with training around 1pm and eat until 8pm. Most days I will start eating at 2 or 3pm (18-19hr fast). I do not find this difficult.

Progress improved greatly in the last couple of weeks - I attribute this to training stimulus increasing and the fact that my protein and BCAA supplements arrived. I use them on training days only. 

I missed one day of training (Monday 18th) as I was out of the country for a meeting. I fasted on this day instead, consuming about 600kcals. It wasn't too bad.

Weights are consistently increasing (all 3 sets of 5 as per SS practical programming):

Squat: 90kgs (198lbs) - 135kgs (297lbs)

Deadlift: 120kgs (264lbs) - 150kgs (330lbs)

Bench: 60kgs (132lbs) - 75kgs (165lbs)

Press: 40kgs (88lbs) - 55kgs (121lbs)

Pull ups: 3 sets of 5 strict - 3 sets of 7 strict

Kipping pull ups: 3 sets of 10 - 3 sets of 13

Male, 31yo, 6'7"", -20/+20 Recomp over 3 months

**Starting Stats:** Weight=184lbs, DL: 260lbs, Back Squat: 190lbs, Bench: 184lbs, DB Press: (not tracked initially, but I'd guess ~95lbs)

**Current Stats:** Weight=173lbs, DL: 305lbs (Stopped DL after 2 months b/c tweeked my back), Back Squat: 225lbs (Switched to front squats after said back tweek, 195lbs current front squat max), Bench: 196lbs, DB Press: 107lbs

**Background:** I'd done some lifting in the past, but tracked nothing and didn't stick to a program over a long period of time. I had completed P90X start to finish 3 times over the last 4 years. I lost a lot of weight in the initial round (215 down to 185), then restarted it in subsequent years to maintain and hopefully improve my physique. I also considered myself pretty active cardio-wise, regularly playing pickup basketball and biking. Leangains is the first time I've tracked what I eat and had specific nutrition goals, and the first time I've lifted heavy (5 reps or less) since high school.

**Notes on my leansgains experience:** My starting TDEE was 2350 kcals. I recalculated to 2200 kcals about 1 1/2 months in as I lost over 5lbs in weight. Used the 5-3-1 BBB rountine. For the first 2 month I did exclusively dead lifts or squats as my primary lifts, as I was recovering from some elbow surgeries. I'd alternate which lift I did twice per week (on a 3-workout/week schedule). That's why my bench and db press doesn't show up on my lift chart until about 2 months in. Around the same time I started doing bench and presses, I injured my lower back (poor form and tried too much weight) and have not yet returned to doing DLs. You'll also notice on my chart that my squats dipped a good deal—that initial dip is from when I switched from back squats to front squats. I work out fasted, then eat from 1pm–9pm. I'm really pleased with the progress thus far, and frankly this system of working out and nutrition is far more manageable than anything I've done in the past.

**Questions:** 

1. I didn't expect my results to be this significant this fast. Is it possible I miscalculated my TDEE? I have a desk job and only recently started doing cardio on rest days (and adjusted my rest day kcals upward accordingly). Are these results typical of a recomp?

2. Where do I go from here? As a former fatty, bulking scares me somewhat, but I want to continue to get stronger. Anyone with a similar fear that can share their experience on a slow bulk? -10/+30? Or should I continue with the recomp?

3. Estimates on my body fat % please?

All year I've been regularly attending (3-4x week) Crossfit and alternating between keto and primal dieting with occasional indulgences. I lost a lot of progress as I was out of town for most of June and dieting mostly went to shit. 

Three weeks ago I began a -30/-10, 16/8 Leangains approach. [Here]( http://i.imgur.com/wzybZvO.jpg) are my macros. I am getting most of my calories from chicken and beef, protein shakes, QuestBars, vegetables (carrots and broccoli), sweet potatoes and rarely: So Delicious Coconut Ice Cream. I am trying to avoid all breads/grains except on workout days where I'll sometimes eat rice in order to hit my carb intake (I've been avoiding carbs so long it's been tough figuring out how to work them in again). Diet soda has been my nemesis and I'm drinking way too much, so I'm aiming to cut it out entirely over the next week in exchange for water and coffee.

My workout routine: I've cut out CrossFit WODs in exchange for Wendler's 5/3/1 program 4x week and his 'Boring But Big' assistance work. I plan on incorporating some light cardio and Yohimbine HCL supplements 3-4x week. Also, I should note that I am in construction which requires a lot of heavy lifting and constant movement.

The examples included fit 180g of protein from a variety of sources into 2000 calories. Everything is also really easy to make, usually about 5-10 minutes per meal item and can be easily prepared in bulk. The macro split is not necessarily something you'd want to use directly (this is neither a rest nor workout day for me, I eat 150g anyway) - I suggest tweaking things to your own flair, and of course you can scale the entire plan to whatever calories you want. I will add my preferred brands in parentheses if I have any, as I think that may help people who are feeling overwhelmed. Onward!


**First meal item - Parfait (lacto-vegetarian) - ~500 calories / ~35g protein:**


* Muesli (Red Mill) - 1/2 cup
* Greek Yogurt (Fage) - 1/2 cup
* Fat Free Milk - 1 cup
* Fat Free Cottage Cheese - 1/4 cup
* Banana, sliced into thin coins - 1/2 half banana
* Seedless grapes - 1/2 cup


If you decide to make this on a regular basis and start to get bored, experiment with different fruit. I personally enjoy very ""liquidy"" parfaits, and I also don't usually measure *that* carefully. Experiment with the ratios too. :)


One final thing, beware the temptation to use granola: it packs a LOT of calories (which is why it's mountain climbing food). I would suggest cereal or dry oatmeal if you don't like muesli.


**Second meal item - Seitan sandwich and lentil soup (vegan) - ~900 calories / ~100g protein:**




* Seitan strips (Susie's) - 4 strips (4 oz)
* Hickory liquid smoke - 1 tsp
* Whole wheat bread (Dave's Killer Power Seed) - 2 slices
* (Honey) Dijon Mustard - 2 tsp
* Romaine leave - 3 leaves
* Red onion slice - (~1/8"" thick) 2 slices
* Avocado, cut into slices - (~1/4 avocado) 3 slices
* Lentil soup - 1 cup



If you can source dried seitan jerky, or make it yourself, the sandwich becomes twice as tasty (IMO). I took the vegenaise and maple syrup out of the recipe found [here](http://kblog.lunchboxbunch.com/2012/02/smoky-maple-homemade-seitan-sandwich.html).


**Third meal item - ""kitchen sink"" salad (vegan) - ~600 calories / ~40g protein:**


* Spinach - 5 cups
* Broccoli - 1 cup
* Cauliflower - 1 cup
* Cucumber, coined - 1/4 cucumber
* Brussel sprouts - 1/4 cup
* Carrots, shaved - 1/4 cup
* Mixed chopped bell peppers - 1 cup
* Quinoa, cooked - 0.5 cups
* Flax seed (Red Mill) - 1 Tbsp
* Tofu, firm - (4 oz) 0.5 cups
* Green beans - 0.5 cups

The secret with the salad is that it is a huge medley of stuff. You should regularly change around what types of beans and veggies you'd like it in. Yes, skip the dressing. If you need something on the salad because it's too ""raw"", add cheeses instead.

Update since previous post: I continued fasted training without BCAA for a few days and consistently failed before my prescribed reps. When I switched back to following Martin's prescribed dosage and timing of BCAA, my lifts immediately went back to where they should be (IE: I even regained the ground I'd ""lost"").

Currently I am using a total of 30g of BCAA during my morning fast/workout and will start titrating that down by 5g a week as long as my progress continues. I am curious to see if I can still maintain consistent progress with a smaller dose.

This may be due to poor food selection that doesn't lead to satiety but regardless, some may find they are still hungry no matter what.        
    Since fiber is often an issue in our diets anyway, and I've seen some Leangains followers post about constipation, I had these fiber gummies from Target. They taste like fruit snacks, and have 10 calories/5g fiber per serving (two gummies). My little trick is, if I have hit my calorie ceiling for the day and still feel like snacking, is to have a couple of these. They take a while to chew, are sweet and won't kill your fasting state really. I'll grab a few if I am hungry in my fasting window, and they really help me feel like I've had something to ""eat"" when really the impact is minimal and quite helpful (5g/fiber per serving).  
    Anyway just thought I'd share my experience with how helpful it's been to have these around the house. They've helped with regularity and sticking to LG a lot easier. Even though some may balk at ingesting calories during the fasting period, I say that this is 100x better than succumbing to hunger and eating real food. I still got cut on LG while doing this little trick, ~8%BF so it won't fuck your shit up.

Since I'm not going to be adding any muscle on a cut and I don't seem to be adding strength either, I was thinking this may be a good time to improve upon my muscle endurance and cardiovascular health.

I was thinking a little running, stair/hill running, Insanity.  No strict schedule but probably only stair/hill running on the same days as lifting or on the first day of the 2 day rest.

I also planned to take a conservative estimate and adding the calories from these exercises to my daily count.

(Shitty phone quality, yay)

Day by day you don't feel the difference, but damn, taking the pictures was worth it. That comparison is 20 september (start) to 20 feb, plan to end the bulk next week and start cutting a bit after easter break.

I'm 6 ft 2, weight started at 171 lbs at the start and on the end picture is on 180. Bodyft hovered around the same value (which I don't know since I was using a caliper and didn't bother converting cm to %, I just wanted to track changes). Meal timing was more or less around 16/8. Along with weight lifting I tried to go for Yoga (great mobility work after heavy deadlifts). Some days didn't get great amounts ofsleep due to deadlines. Caffeine was taken on WO days only.

Diet and training were nothing that you can't find on the sidebar, started with a 0 / +20 and after 2 months switched to +10 / +30 since my fat gain was under control. My diet was relatively clean (post workout meal consisted of 500g lean beef + 500g rice with sauce) but I had a decent amount of cheat days (always on wo days). Routine was a 3 days split pyramidal LG style, after 3 months and half switched to a 4 days split.

What's to be learned from this?

* Results need to be tracked (said the guy who only took shitty front pictures). Don't expect to rely on day-by-day comparison. Those pics are a huge boost of motivation for me and I can't wait to see what results I'll have at the end of the bulk.

This a totally valid use of /r/leangains, and I have no problem with it. But I'm just curious - to those who are currently seeing great results or have seen great results in the past, what works for you? What's your height/weight/BF%/goals and how are you getting there? How did you get there before? I'll start:

Stats:

* 5' 8""

* 179 lbs/81.5 kg
* 17% BF

Long-term Goals:

* Slow cut to 10% bodyfat

* Modest, yet linear gains in all 4 lifts throughout cut

Plan:

* -30/0 diet with 1.2x multiplier = 1550/2200
* rest days: 80f/40c/180p; workout days: 35f/280c/180p
* training: minimalist RPT with deads, bench, and squats anchoring a 3x/week plan. Nearly no accessories beyond grip training and side bends.
* activity: bike to work 5x/week (3 miles each way) and the occasional brisk walk

Progress: 

* I started on 1/1/2013, have lost 1.5 kg so far with visible bodyfat reduction 
* Deadlift has gone from 280x6 to 300x6 in 6 weeks.
* Bench press has astoundingly improved from 195x1 to 210x1 in 6 weeks.
* Squats have improved from 285x6 to 295x6 in 6 weeks.

Notes:

* Adherence has been garbage, probably 75% at best. After SB weekend I've been dialed in and expect to lose more fat.

* Pleasantly surprised on strength progress, especially bench. I add either 1.25 lbs (bench, weighted chins) or 2.5 lbs (deads, squats) every week with no stall in reps. Linear strength gains.

* 180 g protein is a minimum - I'm usually closer to 200-210g. When I do so, I reduce carbs or fats to stay within calorie limits.

* Biggest assets: broccoli, Greek yogurt, 88% dark chocolate, scotch, and tons of red meat

* Biggest obstacles: cheese, bread, beer, and especially pie. I can eat an entire 9"" apple pie in one sitting. And I have. 3,000 calories in one sitting.

Overall, I'm pleased so far. I hope with 90-95% adherence I can make 12% bodyfat by summer and power through to 9-10% by late fall. I hope to post my results thread here at that time! This turned out being longer than I intended, but hopefully others can post abbreviated versions of what's working for them.

I had been using BCAA exactly as prescribed by Martin since I started Leangains because my feeding window is 12-8 and I train at 6am. I had never failed to make the prescribed weight/reps on any workout during that time.

This week I started a new cycle of 5/3/1 and figured I would experiment with not using BCAAs to see if I could cut some cost by no longer using them. This week was all 3x5 workouts and on each main lift I was only able to get 3.5 on the third set. This is the first time since beginning the program that I have not been able to complete the prescribed workout.

The only change in my diet/lifestyle is the removal of BCAA. I did change the timing of my creatine as well though, so perhaps that is contributing. Previously, I would mix creatine with my BCAA so I would get a 5g preWO and 5g postWO. Since I stopped the BCAA, I took the creatine with my pre-bed magnesium the night before. Most studies I have seen show that the timing of creatine is inconsequential, but nonetheless I will try moving that back to preWO next week to see if I have better success in the gym. If I still continue to lag, I think I'm going to have to bite the bullet and bring BCAA's back into the mix.",,False,,t5_2saqe,False,,,True,t3_11r7vy,http://www.reddit.com/r/leangains/comments/11r7vy/fwiw_my_n1_experiment_with_bcaa_during_fasted/,

I recently changed the shades in my bedroom which allows much more sunlight into the room than before. In retrospect I should have taken my pics in a room whose lighting quality isn't at the mercy of sunlight.

Came home in April after teaching English in South Korea noticing that I had kind of let myself go due lack of exercise. I didn't notice before because I had such an awesome time! However, now that I was home I decided to do something about it :). Let me know what you think!

* Height: 5'10""

* Weight: Stopped caring around the beginning of July. Would you like to guess? Next time I weigh myself I'll post here and you can see if your guess is correct :P.

Overall I'm using the mirror/camera as my main indicator of progress. I don't really care about my weight/BF%.

All Pro's Simple Beginner's Routine (All Pro's SBR)
[Thread on BB.com](http://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=147447933)

5 week cycle using your 10 Rep-Max with only 90 seconds between work-sets on the following exercises:

1. Squat 
2. Bench Press 
3. Bent-Over Rows
4. Overhead Barbell Press
5. Stiff-Legged Deadlift
6. Barbell Curls
7. Standing Calf Raises

Schedule (3x/week):
Monday - Heavy- 2x8-12 of 10RM adding one rep each week until I hit 12 reps. At which point I reset to 8 reps and increase the weight by 10%. If I fail to complete 2 sets of 12 reps on Week 5 I restart the cycle using the same weight. 2 warm-up sets (25%, 50% work weight) for the first three exercises.

Wednesday - Medium - 2x8-12 using 90% of Monday's weight. Starting at 8 reps and adding 1 rep each week until I hit 12 reps. 2 warm-up sets (25%, 50% Monday weight) for the first three exercises.

Friday - Light - 2x8-12 using 80% of Monday's weight. Starting at 8 reps and adding 1 rep each week until I hit 12 reps. 2 warm-up sets (25%, 50% Monday weight) for the first three exercises.

I did absolutely **NO CARDIO** except yard work and occasional walking

**Diet**

* Before reading Eat Stop Eat/How Much Protein, I tried bulking for the first 1.5 months as I thought that was the only way to build mass. Didn't like what I was seeing in the mirror. I do not recommend bulking for skinny-fats like me!

* Started fasting 16-22 hours a day as I preferred a somewhat consistent feeding window. I wasn't anal about macros. I suppose you could say I fasted LG-style but subscribed to Brad Pilon's relaxed nutritional philosophy more rather than Martin Berkan's high-protein cycling methodology.

* Used FitDay to track calories. As I said, I wasn't strict on macros. If I consumed atleast 90-100g of protein and 60-70g of Fat I was content. If you're a beginner like me, don't bother with all the overly-complex macro cycling stuff that will only serve as an illusion of giving yourself an ""edge"" (I fell for it at first too!).

* Started **low** on calories (around a weekly average of 1550 cals) and tapered upward. I think my no-cardio maintenance is in the range of 1950-2100 calories. This week I'm aiming for a week average of ~1800 calories.

Above pics: 1st was taken Dec 2010 (~88kg, 2nd was taken August 2011 (77kg).
For the first few months I was on a mix of training programs (mostly body building) and just eating whatever, and saw little results, I lost a couple of kgs.
It was only until I discovered LeanGains is where I started to scorch through my fat loss, although looking back and researching more on LeanGains I am convinced I was not doing it properly. 
In about a 4-6 months period prior to going to Europe I was training like crazy - 5-6 even 7 days a week (Permanent Muscle required 5 days training per week + training weak parts on rest days), and spending loads on supplements and doing some pretty intense cardio.
I was not counting my macros and just ate lots of protein and tried to keep carbs/fat low (just cause thats what you hear everywhere if you want to lose fat). I cut all junk food and soft drinks from my diet and also quit alcohol. I was basically a fitness junkie.

***The only Lean Gains protocol I followed was the 16/8 fasting/feeding window principles.***

It did show some good results I got stronger and leaner but this left me EXHAUSTED, unsociable (no alcohol/junk food fights with gf when going out to eat etc)

**I am now sure that there is a more efficient way to do it as well as being able to live and eat/drink the foods you want!**

More recently, I stopped training for a few months (Early 2012) because of a lower back injury (BAD FORM FROM HEAVY LIFTS!) and slowly put the weight and fat back on. Im probably back toward the 1st picture but not so much and about 87kgs)

About 2 months ago I joined a performance (anti-bro) power lifting gym which prioritises perfect form on the basic lifts - squats/deads/bench.
I am now 7 weeks into Lean Gains, only training 3 days per week and doing a proper +/-20 macro. My strength has increased and I have no lower back pain anymore (due to proper coaching at my gym)
I'm eating foods I want as well as having days off to do whatever! I also enjoy the occasional beer.

With my second time around doing Lean Gains armed with more knowledge and experience (and r/leangains) I'm going to try and see if I can match or better my previous result with more efficiency and less obsession.",,False,,t5_2saqe,1346432274.0,,,True,t3_z55ka,http://www.reddit.com/r/leangains/comments/z55ka/trial_error_lean_gains_20/,

Maybe I'm oversimplifying things, but here's the way I look at it:

* cutting = focus on losing fat
* bulking = focus on adding muscle
* recomp = slowly doing both at the same time (fine tuning)

So it seems clear to me that if you're fat you should cut, if you're skinny you should bulk.  Once you're happy with your composition is when you fine tune things to your own liking using whichever of the three modes is most applicable to your current goals.

Is it a language problem?  I've often heard people outside LG refer to ""getting cut"" or ""getting ripped"" to mean something similar to how LG uses the term bulking.

Height 1.77cm ( 5ft 10inches)

Bench: 115kgx1----&gt;120kgx1
Deadlift: 200kgx1----&gt;205kgx1

I had been doing a -30/-30 (fuck all my muscle mass) aggressive cut for a week which was around 1500 cals. Unbeknownst to me was that I was actually ONLY eating 1500 TOTAL, not NET.......and was totally fucked after that week. 
I've since bumped that up to around 1700 net cals ( If that still sounds wrong, please retrain me, I'm still lost with the whole cals in/out) but it seems to be working as I've been making slight gains and feel energised in the gym.

I use MFP to calculate all my calories and weigh as much food as I can. 

I keep to a 2.3g/kg bodyweight intake of protein and usually have to supplement it with ON Gold standard, Extreme carbs and Xtend BCAAS  due to the fact that I'm a poor uni student and its hard to reach my macros cheaply.

Speaking of macros: W/O days and rest days P/CHO/F (168/150/50). However on weekends I try to reduce my carbs and increase my fats

Due to my uni schedule I usually eat 2-3 meals although most days I would fast more than 16hrs so I could break my fast after my afternoon workout.
Workout regime (focused more on strength alternating with 5/3/1, 5x5 and 3/2/1 sets for the big lifts and some 6-12x3 sets for the aesthetically pleasing muscles...
Mon- Chest/tri: Flat db press, incline db press, tricep pushdowns, weighted dips

Tues- Legs/lower back: Squat, leg ext, hyperextensions, front squat, 45 degree leg press

Wed- Back/bi/abs: Penlay rows, lat pulldown, trap pulldowns, db shrugs, EZ-bar curls, hammer curls and a few burn out sets of various weight based ab exercises

Thur- Chest/shoulders: BB bench press, BB decline bench press, DB press, lateral db flys, cable pull throughs???? I don't know what it's called but it smashes my lower pec when pulled across the face of the pectoral.

Fri- Deadlifts: with chalk and weight belt as my lower back has minor lordosis and would otherwise ""snap my shit up"" 

I realise it goes against the 3 workout principle but its working for me.

I'd gladly give more information on my exercises, but as I said earlier, my confusion is with my Calories. Being that I'm getting close to lower BF%s what numbers should I be ingesting to prevent muscle loss and keep burning that fat off? Cheers all!

I entered the BTFC today marks the ends of my 3 months leangains cut. 
here is my [before and after](http://imgur.com/hIhuu).    The top one is my before and the bottom is how I look today. At the top one I weighed around 99~100 kilo's or 220 lbs and at the bottom I weigh 95.2 kg/209lbs. 

Anyways I'm going to move away from my strength based workouts to more a more bodybuilders based workouts (I want to be more aesthetic xD).


 1. So I wondered if you could estimate what my bodyfat is based on my picture. (stupid machine still tells me that i'm around 17% - 18% bf).

 2. And I wanted to know if you guys have any experience with a workout with more volume should. Does it suit the recomp protocol well or should  I just do a cleanbulk.

Oh, And here some stats

I found leangains last summer and had good results. Before christmas, I started reading too much shit, tried to incorporate all of it, changed my training/diet and got fat(ter)/weak. (Fuckarounditis)  
I found Rippedbody.jp a couple of months ago and decided to re-focus my diet and training. I went for a cut at roughly -30/+10.  
Training still suffered a bit of Fuckarounditis, as I was experimenting with an A/B set up:  
A:  
Squat (RPT, Power to the People style: working in 5's)  
Overhead Press (SS to RPT, as weights went up)  
Weighted Chins (RPT)  
B:  
Deadlift (RPT, Power to the People style)  
Bench (RPT)  
Single Arm TRX face pulls (SS)  

This has eventually evolved into, as in my last week's workouts:  
M.  
Deadlift (RPT, 4-6, 6-8, 8-10) (Those ranges represent targets for each set)  
Weighted Chins (RPT, 6-8, 8-10, BW to ""Failure"") (I should lower the rep ranges a bit, I think)  
W.  
Bench (RPT, 6-8, 8-10, 10-12+)  
Weighted Dips (Bro-Style, 3 sets of 10, can't help it)  
Suspended/Regular Pushups (Bro-Style to failure, 3 sets, again, can't help it)  
F.  
Squat (RPT, 6-8, 8-10, 10-12+) (Hit 15 on my final set this week, for fun)  
Overhead (RPT 6-8, 8-10, Handstand Pushups to ""Failure)/Handstand PU's 3 sets to ""Failure""   
Overhand Pullups (BW 3.8)  
This is essentially the RPT routine on Rippedbody.jp, with a few modifications.  

Here is the current result:  
http://i41.tinypic.com/350os41.jpg

During the first portion of the cut, I learned a few things:  
1. Use a lower BMR multiplier. This allows a little more sanity, as in ""not counting every single vegetable, etc.""  
2. Keep workouts intense, but brief. Do NOT squat/deadlift everyday you're in the gym if you are approaching higher numbers in these lifts. Back pain will result.  
3. As BF% drops, the cut HAS to slow down. Fatigue/Pain began to accumulate and almost immediately disappeared when I shifted to -20/+10.  
4. Working in higher rep ranges seems to reduce systemic/CNS fatigue by staying a bit farther from 1RM.  

Current Stats (in LBs):  
DL 275x6 (Going for 285 monday)  
Bench 175x6 (STUCK)  
Weighted Chins BW+45x6  
Squat 255x8  
BW 130-132  
Height 5'4  

I intend to cut a bit longer and then progress into a slow bulk. I really just wanted to share my experience with IF in a public forum, as I have been inspired by others along the way. I apologize for not having ""Before"" pictures. I was disgusted with myself and did not want to document that phase of my existence. I am 7-9 LBs lighter at this point.  
Any insight/comments/questions are welcome. Thanks!

So I used to maintain a lean body. No big, no gym material, no skinny and no fat just a fairly lean athletic body. Problems started when I tried to bulk to gain more muscle. 

I got fatter and actually skinnyfat because the fat I had didn't match the muscles I had. So I started to cut and lost most of my pre existing muscle mass, looking like a flat cardboard with still excess fat in the belly. Something got disupted and I haven't been able to get back to a normal physique since then.

Even with leangains. I tried to bulk, IF, high protein, carb cycling and still got fat. Now I'm trying to cut and look flatter every day with such a frail trunk it's unbelievable.

I feel like a broken glass and you can't glued the pieces back together. Sorry but I don't have any pic, you have to take my words for it but if this resonates with your experience and you were in the same place at some point, what you did to get out from this mess?

Here are a few points that I have gathered...

* Slower Digestion
        -Since meal timing isn't really an issue, and it doesn't matter how fast your protein is absorbed.  From what I understand it just matters that you get it in.  There are many times I have gone a day meeting my protein macros without a ""quick release"" formula.  I keep a very diverse diet, so I am sure that I am meeting a decent amino acid profile.
* Satiation
        -Casein is much better at telling my belly that it is full, for a longer time.  I like the texture to a casein as well as it is creamier and makes for a better smoothie.
* Protein = Protein?

Just a thought I had while deciding wether I wanted to restock my 10lb bag of whey or if I wanted to go a different route and buy casein for its satiation benefits.  I know that that casein is a little more expensive but my 10lbs bag lasted me since February and I know I still have a good 10 servings left.

Besides the price, what could I possibly benefit from putting **Whey** vs. **Casein** considering the previous?


**Edit**
So here is another question.  There was a study done on proteins that gave a percentage of protein that was actually absorbed/available vs. what was advertised.  Were any of these studies credible?  And if they were would anyone know if I am actually going to get more of less of my 24g from the whey or casein brands?",,False,,t5_2saqe,1376158323.0,,,True,t3_1k39cv,http://www.reddit.com/r/leangains/comments/1k39cv/since_meal_timing_doesnt_matter_could_you/,

I understand we're not obese women (at least not most of us), but the fact that the time of day calories are consumed actually matters to anyone is a bit perplexing to me.

I'd really like to know if calories were ""self reported"". If so, I can throw this study out. The study was small and short in duration (12 weeks).

According to this article

http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/releases/264529.php


&gt; Researchers split 93 obese women into two groups. Each group ate 1,400 calories daily for 12 weeks. The first group consumed 700 calories at breakfast, 500 at lunch, and 200 at dinner. The second group ate 200 calories at breakfast, 500 at lunch, and 700 at dinner.

&gt;By the end of the study, those in the 'big breakfast' group had lost an average of 17.8 pounds each and three inches off their waist, compared to a 7.3 pound and 1.4 inch loss for women in the 'big dinner' group.

But alas, I was stubborn.  I thought that if I kept cutting and exercising, like I had been, that I would would be 6-pack bound.
All I wanted to do was lose fat. And the scale was going down so I thought the muscle will just show more and more.

So anyway, I continued on my cut as I had been doing for months.  But as of late I'm realizing that not only does the scale not budge anymore, but *I am also totally losing muscle definition.*    At first I thought it was my imagination, but then I compared pics with the mirror and it's very obvious.  I think if I continued like this I could even become some strong rendition of a skinny-fat guy, haha!


**Please note (don't hate me):** This was my first time going on a diet ever in my life.  I am 20 pounds lighter than the start of the year (5'11, 180 to 160lbs).  I had NO concept of what the point of cut/bulk cycles were.  **I had NO idea that I was looking *strong* at the time because I was in a ""premium"" timeframe where the muscle was still plenty but the fat was less.** My naivety thought that would continue indefinitely.



But *now* I understand that I have to bulk to gain muscle mass, then cut to show how ripped I am underneath.  And if I just keep doing that cycle, I'll probably look hella-sculpted months/years down the line and then I could recomp forever.

Since Monday (5 days ago), I decided to [take a break from the diet](http://www.bodyrecomposition.com/fat-loss/the-full-diet-break.html) for 2 weeks before I transition into anything else. (So I'm eating at maintenance with minimum 150g carbs and still working out 3-4x/week).

After the full diet break is over, I will go on a bulk/recomp of some sort, I suppose.  But it's summer, so I don't want to pack on the fat like whoa either.

* What are some LeanGains appropriate bulking options?
* I hear people say ""slow bulk"". What's the advantage/disadvantage of that?
* I've also read people go on short cycles (e.g., bulk 6 weeks, cut 2 weeks?), are those worthy of consideration?

**tl;dr: I'm losing muscle definition on a cut. After my full diet break is over, I am seriously considering going on a bulk or recomp of some sort.  What is the best plan to pack on muscle but not too much fat at the same time? (cause it's summer)**

I started my bodyweight cut october 3rd through to march 4, when I started Greyskull LP, which I'm still doing.

Starting at around 76-77 kilo's in October:
http://i.imgur.com/30yilja.png

First month of bodyweight I was doing a Convict Conditioning based program, which I had done before. After about I month I switched to a routine based on Overcoming Gravity (recommended by /r/bodyweightfitness ). I lost my 5kg, to a low of 72.3kg. I started out on what I thought would be recomp, but weight started to go down, which was fine at the time, so I didn't adjust calories, and ended up cutting.

I ended up around 73kg at the start of March:
http://i.imgur.com/BRrXq4y.png
http://i.imgur.com/bhScemD.png
http://i.imgur.com/Uj8XRRY.png

After that I switched to Greyskull LP, where I continued with the recomp protocol (-20%+20%), but ended up gaining about 2kg in 3 months (from a weekly average of 73 to a weekly average of about 75). I like eating a lot, so I overshoot my calories quite often in that period (convincing myself: ""it's ok, I'm going to switch to slow bulk soon anyway""). 

I've since had to deload on all my big lifts except deadlifts, but that getting close as well. So I thought this would be a nice point to switch to slow bulk. I'm wondering if I'm lean enough to do a slow bulk from where I am now.

There is a UK TV show called Secret Eaters. All episodes are on Youtube. It's great to see how much people can delude themselves into eating junk. 

Most people on the show are obese and say they ""can't understand"" why because ""they don't eat much"". If you are in that situation, you'll want to watch them all, it'll definitely clear up the ""why"" for you.

Almost all the guests eat obvious ""bad foods"" ie chips etc. But interestingly, in one episode there is a girl who actually eats ""healthy"", ie kind of Paleo-style. But she doesn't count calories at all. 

I used to be in that situation, and got up a few percentage in body fat by gorging on ""healthy"" nuts, oils on salads etc.

Anyway, strongly recommended. This show is what motivated me to buy a scale and look up nutritional data for everything I eat, in order to finally reach clarity on what I'm eating and make informed decisions.

I've cheated a LOT on lean gains - I've given myself a cheat day every week or two and I've drank a lot. But despite this I continue to stick to the program and see results.

I've never been so lean as on LG.  I'm hovering around 10%bf right now.

For those of us who have to work 8-5 or similar hours, evening workouts are often the only real option.  For example I go to the gym from 7-8PM.  This means that I have to cram 2000+ calories into my post workout meal between 8 and 10PM, and that of course means I won't be eating again until 2PM the next day.

As much as I love the 2-hour carb cram fest initially, there is a point after which it becomes painful and more importantly may have diminishing returns regarding muscle growth.

So I am going to propose a bit of a 24 hour ""day"" hack, and implement it into my own regimen:

1) the ""workout day"" calories and macros start post-workout and continue for 24 hours
2) the ""rest day"" calories and macros are in effect any time other than the first 24 hours after a workout

I will maintain the 16 hour fast and calorie/carb cycling.  The major changes are to the post-workout dinner (i.e. it's not necessary to eat 2000 clean calories in one sitting), and lunch the following day to break the fast (i.e. it will be a large meal that is carb and protein heavy).  The total calories from these two meals will equal TDEE + workout day surplus.

Just to continue the logic into the rest ""day"" 24 hours--  the next dinner and lunch, which will now be more than 24 hours after the workout, will be high in protein and fat.  The total calories for these two meals will equal TDEE - rest day deficit.

Thoughts?  Has anyone tried anything similar?

Thought I'd throw these pics up. The 21st Sept pics were taken a day before my first BB comp. After doing 1h 45m of cardio every day, plus 4 days of weights. Rotating diet of: pro/fat day followed by 2 pro/veggie days. Trace carbs from veggies and nuts, though I don't count the carbs from these.

Fast forward to March this year. After deciding to give IF a try. Started with the Renegade Diet by Jason Feruggia, then moving over to LG for the last few months. My goal was to try to maintain a low (for me) BF. Dropped weights down to 3 x week. Only cardio is 2 days of 2-3 hour walks. I drop flyers for my business, so usually drop 500 on a Tuesday, and another 500 on a Thursday. The difference in weight is only 4-5kg between pics. 

The best part for me is I can enjoy my carbs again and not worry to much about them. I still keep strict though and count my macros. I'm not doing an hour of cardio first thing in the morning, only to go back to the gym during the day for another 45mins. Then an hour and a 1/2 to 2 hours of weights. 

Once my wife and I get back from a cruise on the 10th April, it's game time as far as building muscle. I need to fill out my long limbed frame, so if I decided to compete again I won't look like I don't belong onstage. I was no where near as lean or muscular as I wanted or should've been. Excess skin an issue to. But I enjoyed the whole experience. The diet was the killer though!

1. I only eat breakfast on weekends, when I can enjoy it with my family. I eat whatever I feel like on these occasions.
1. I always work out on an empty stomach.
1. I combine many different workouts in roughly equal proportions: weight lifting, HIIT/Tabata/Crossfit, running (long distance, sprints, intervals, hills).
1. On rest days, I either skip lunch or eat extremely light (nuts, berries, avocados).
1. Unless I did an extreme workout, I try to stay low on carbs, even on workout days.
1. I never eat/snack between meals.
1. I drink large amounts of water, a few espressos and green tea throughout the day.

1. I throw in a few cheat days every month. everything is going well so I don't feel bad about these.
1. I supplement with mutivitamin, BCAA (sometimes before hard workouts), vitamin D (at least in winter), ZMA and fish oil.

* Grocery shopping only once or twice a week and having everything go straight into my fridge or freezer except for cooking oil and dry starches.
* During my fasts, whenever I get the hunger sensation, it actually just means I'm thirsty and need a glass of water.
* The liberty of cooking only once, doing dishes only once, and keeping a lean kitchen with no snack foods or instant meals.
* Calorie counting is a thing of the past.  I now either count ""workout day"" or ""rest day"" when I prepare my preset meals.
* No Tupperware.  No three hour windows.  No broscience about cholesterol, saturated fat, or sodium.  Just results.
* Not even having to worry or think about food from 9PM-5PM.  (My fasts are a little longer than most - I prefer it this way)
* Muscle building, fat loss, and healthy living all in one simple, convenient, and affordable package.
* Better quality workouts - cardio, calisthenics, and weights.  I break the fast with whey/BCAAs and pedal to the metal!
* Freedom and flexibility.  I can drink, have dinner parties, or a massive cheesecake when I prepare for it and deserve it.
* Productivity.  Food used to totally rule and consume my life.  I don't obsess anymore... my routine and my material do the work for me now.",,False,,t5_2saqe,True,,,True,t3_jylqs,http://www.reddit.com/r/leangains/comments/jylqs/whats_are_your_favourite_things_about_the_iflg/,

On January 1st I decided to begin intermittent fasting. I did this for 2 weeks without counting macros or doing actual leangains. 

On january 14th, I found leangains, and did it by the book from day one. I did the recommended -20+20 recomp for 4 weeks. I have some pictures, but honestly I didn't look much different. I made very slight strength gains and made very little body fat loss. 

At this point, frustrated, I asked r/leangains and decided to get a little leaner, and then begin bulking. I've been on a -30+10 cut for about 4 weeks and have seen significant fat losses. 

Here are my progress pictures thus far: http://imgur.com/a/Xg4EF#8LaZ1Gw

Just to keep in mind, my before pictures were after a tough workout, and these after pictures are now, just after waking up. 

I am 6'2

In January I was 197 Pounds
I am now 185

I followed the RPT set up as outlined here:

* http://rippedbody.jp/reverse-pyramid-training/ 

but I added accessory exercises to fit my personal goals.

* Mondays: Back/Biceps
* Wednesday: Chest/Tricep
* Friday: Legs/Shoulders

Here is a link to my workout log Excel spreadsheet, some of the dates may be weird due to me not updating them correctly or you may not understand some things I wrote down. It just shows you my progress:

http://www.filedropper.com/workoutchart


My January lifting numbers were: 

* Squat: 225x8
* Bench Press: 225x6
* Deadlift: 255x6
* Chin ups: 8 Bodyweight

My March lifting numbers are:

* Squat: 265x7
* Bench Press: 225x4
* Deadlift: 315x6
* Chin ups: 8 with 20 pound weight

My bench has suffered quite a bit, but I'm positive now that I am switching to a -5+20 lean bulk, it will shoot back up.

I feel that I am lean enough to begin bulking just about a pound a month, and if I got any skinnier it would not be aesthetically pleasing or generally worth my time. My plan is to bulk at about 1 pound per month until I wish to do a mini cut. 

I'm really happy with my results and I've never been able to see my abs before, so that was a pretty cool thing I've gotten out of this if anything. I'm always happy to answer questions or offer helpful advice, and I've learned a lot over these 2 months.

I like the cyclicality of it -- lifting days/high calorie days 3x/week and low-calorie days 2x/week ... weekends (for me) tend to be neutral (ideally) from a calorie/activity standpoint.

Issue: getting a little bored with the rigidity of the weight-training but not wanting to give it up, I've wanted to do a bit more running -- just to have another form of training, to improve cardiovascular fitness, and just be more active outside.  

What I can't seem to figure out is how to do this with LG -- Mind, I have tried incorporating running (we're talking short runs btw -- a couple miles) with LG in the past generally doing it either in the morning of a lift day or in the evening on a rest day.

Also we needn't always combine proteins with compelte amino acid profile. For instance, we can eat black beans in the mornings and brown rice a few hours later. 

This is particularly helpful for people on economical budget like me. As I can save on the chicken on workout days as I need to eat more calories anyways too.

I am just wondering if anyone else notices this and also if you have any idea what causes it.

Elevated feet rack pulls instead?,21,3,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/leangains/comments/198mhu/deadlifting_with_12sided_plates_elevated_feet/,"Hey guys, so like most LGer's I do heavy deadlifts using RPT, and as I've upped the weight and sets, I've started to get more annoyed by the 12-sided shape of the plates at my gym (See: http://dumbbellbuddy.com/images/irongrip_plates/ig-urethane-500.jpg). One day while watching some deadlifting tip videos, I saw a comment mentioning how such plates are bad for DLing.

Now I'm sure some of you will think that it doesn't make a difference and that if I'm DLing correctly the weight should just go up and down, but frankly when you're going for a max effort set(aka, every deadlift day; it's RPT after all) it's distracting to have 300+ pounds rolling around such that every rep you need either readjust your footing, move the bar, or focus on setting the wieght down gingerly enough to not have one of the plates spin. It's also troublesome because I tend to think ""pull back"" on deadlifts, and in getting that initial momentum off the floor, the shape seems to inhibit my motion. More than anything, though, it just messes with my focus.

My question is then, if I do bottom pin rack pulls while standing on an elevated platform such that my range of motion is essentially the same as with my regular DL, is there any biomechanical difference I'm not noticing? At first glace it seems they should be exactly the same on your body, but for some reason a quick google search shows me that some people(like the StrongLifts dude) recommend against this since you're doing a ""rack pull and not a deadlift"" (http://stronglifts.com/deadlifting-with-hexagonal-plates/).

I know that this seems like a ridiculous goal to many of you and I won't argue except to say that I am a rock climber first and foremost--my goals are not primarily driven by my aesthetics nor by my lifts. I have no disrespect for those of you who want to get big and strong--it's just not my jam at the moment.

Thus, I came upon leangains via my charming dr girlfriend (her being a doctor becomes important pretty soon in this story). I started out like many do, committing to the intermittent fast and slowly shaping my macro goals. 

Initially, I tracked calories and protein--largely ignoring my fat/carbs ratio and just eating what I pleased. This cut ten pounds off me in a hurry, as far as I could tell all of it fat. My waist dropped from 33 in to 31 in and despite irregular MRT and random heavy lifting days, my lifts actually increased a bit. At some point I decided to up my protein intake to 200g/day as I restricted my kcal totals further, hoping to improve my overall recovery. 

At some point in the last 2/3 weeks I decided to give full blast by-Martin's-book carb cycling a go. I restricted my workout day fat to 40-50g and my rest day carbs to 50-75g. I'm uncertain if this was doing anything further or not, I haven't stuck to it all that long. Concurrent to this and inspired by all of the ""I eat ice cream daily"" talk found here and elsewhere, I started budgeting low fat ice cream into my day's eating because goddamn it, it's good. On workout days, this was a pretty minor note. However, on rest days 1 cup of ice cream represents more than half of my carb intake for the day.

You've likely figured out where this is going by now, but as of Tuesday night I started experiencing consistant nausea, bloating, and general abdominal discomfort. Where satiety had always been a struggle for me, I found myself feeling sickeningly full at the end of my feedings this past week, several times unable to finish. I complained about it a bit to my g/f but never went into detail because, I dunno, I don't talk about my GI tract with most people.

At some point yesterday, I was miserable and she grilled me in depth about my symptoms. Long story short I have/had a blockage. I spent my Friday night taking laxatives and giving myself two enemas. It was not a good night.


TL;DR I cut too much fiber out of my diet during carb cycling and had to squirt saline up my ass. Learn from my mistake.

Simple spreadsheet with some popular (and often used by me) carb sources.

Since we want to minimize fructose consumption PWO I was curious what the best options were.

Feel free to critique, give feedback or correct :)

PS: I know this is nitpicking/unnecessary but w/e :D

Edit: I see some people worrying about getting too much fructose, you probably shouldn't stress it. Here are some sources:

http://rippedbody.jp/2011/10/01/frequently-asked-questions/


&gt;For the carbs, just make sure you get most of them from whole foods (pasta, rice, bread, potatoes etc…) 80% of the time and you’ll be fine. This is to minimize chances of spill-over into fat stores on your workout days. I’ve expanded on this with and included a quote from Lyle McDonald in the comments below. If you wish to get geekier that that then see the glucose vs. sucrose vs. fructose part of this article by Martin Berkhan.

The quote he mentions:

http://rippedbody.jp/2011/12/17/12-weeks-on-leangains-what-you-can-expect-to-achieve/#comment-2059

&gt;“…people sometimes do notice subjective differences in carb-load quality depending on the types of carbs eaten. Generally, carb-loads based around large amounts of fructose or sucrose (which is half fructose) give inferior results. Fructose is used preferentially by the liver and tends not to be as good at refilling muscle glycogen.
&gt;
&gt;At the same time, small amounts of fructose (perhaps 50 grams over a 24 hour period) or sucrose (100 grams over a 24 hour period) seem to improve the carb-load. I have personally had my best (qualitatively) carb-loads eating primarily starches (bagels, milk, pasta) with small amounts of sucrose (usually some type of sherbet or high sugar cereal). The key is to keep starches dominant with small to moderate amounts of fructose or sucrose. This should let you satisfy any nagging cravings you have without ruining the quality of your carb-load.”

The article he mentions:

http://www.leangains.com/2010/11/cheat-day-strategies-for-hedonist.html

&gt;The above is in particular reference to glucose; sucrose and fructose are more lipogenic due to some differences in metabolic pathways. Fructose do not go to muscle glycogen stores, but to liver glycogen - and this glycogen depot is significantly smaller than muscle glycogen. One study comparing DNL from glucose and sucrose overfeeding in lean and obese people, showed DNL to be 10% and 20% higher respectively after the sucrose-experiment.*
&gt;
&gt;* From results: ""The type of carbohydrate overfeeding (sucrose or glucose) had no significant effect on de novo lipogenesis in either subject group."" Which means that the difference (10-20%) was not enough to be deemed significant from a scientific standpoint. Fructose-overfeeding has not be compared to glucose in a controlled study, but judging from this study, DNL would likely be substantial (sucrose is half fructose, half glucose)

and:

&gt;* Sucrose, fructose and liquid calories, i.e. treats, cakes and alcohol, should preferably be added in last, when you're full from the main meal(s).

Biggest difference has been lately when I've been working on getting my macros right.

I'm 30 on Apr 15th. Was about 82kg, now am 78kg. Strength in all lifts has gone up, except deadlifts because I fked my lower back trying to push too hard.

1373661947.0,19,self.leangains,1i6f75,New Round starting on /r/90daysgoal,25,6,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/leangains/comments/1i6f75/new_round_starting_on_r90daysgoal/,"Almost two and a half years ago, a group of Redditors decided to change their lives at /r/90daysgoal. We just wrapped up Round 10!

With ten successful rounds under our (much) smaller belts, we’re excited to start Round 11 and we’re hoping others will join in.

**What 90days is and what it isn’t**

This isn’t a set diet or exercise routine. This isn’t a competition with prizes (check out /r/BTFC for that). This is a group of people working together to better themselves. Whether you want to change a lot or a little, gain muscle or lose weight, everyone is welcome. More than anything else, this group will provide you with a place to talk to other people about health and fitness in a completely open and friendly environment. No question is too basic here.

**What’s the format?**

Every morning there's a Daily Goal thread where you can post your goals, ask questions, or read through other people’s updates. There's a weekly check-in thread every Monday and several themed posts (Runners, Fitocracy challenges, Students, Women Losing Weight) throughout the week to keep us all on track.

If you'd like to join us for the next round, stop by and tell us about yourself and your goals in the [official introduction thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/1i0967/mod_official_introduction_thread_for_round_11/). Round 11 will officially begin on Monday, July 15th. On Day 1 there will be a signup form to fill out so that we can keep track of group statistics. Group and individual progress will be posted at the end of each month using a display name based on your age, gender, height, and weight (we'll describe how to decipher it all later).

**What are these sprints I keep hearing about?**

You'll see the word ""sprints"" thrown around quite a lot.  Don't worry, we're not going to force anyone to go sprinting.  Sprints are what we do to make it easier to stick to the whole 90 days!  We've split the 90 days into 3 sprints, each one 30 days long plus a 5 day rest period in between.  Why did we do this?  Well, we found out that more people stuck around if they could focus on their goals for shorter periods of time and then have a short rest before resuming.  When you set your goals, you can not only set goals for the entire 90 days, but also for each sprint!

**What's the schedule?**

Sprint 1: July 15 - August 13

Recovery: August 14 - August 18

Sprint 2: August 19 - September 17

Recovery: September 18 - September 22

Sprint 3: September 23 - October 22

TLDR; If you’re interested, subscribe to /r/90daysgoal. Day 1 is July 15th. There will be informational posts throughout the first couple weeks to get everyone started toward their goals. We'll have a progress/recovery week at the end of each month. The final day will be October 22nd. I hope we’ll all have something to celebrate in three months!",,False,,t5_2saqe,False,,,True,t3_1i6f75,http://www.reddit.com/r/leangains/comments/1i6f75/new_round_starting_on_r90daysgoal/,

I found you guys and I gained confidence in myself ever since I started lifting 7 months ago. I didn't know anything about compound movements or anything like that.

Deadlift 5x 255

I know that these numbers aren't that great by r/fitness standards but I just felt excited to share my progress. I also just wanted to thank everyone here for the support and advice I had during my journey. Anyways I want to continue to progress and gain muscle and lose BF.

For background, I'm 5'7"" and ~155 lbs. I started lifting heavy and trying to eat at a deficit at the beginning of February. My overall goal is to lose 10 pounds initially, then lean bulk from there. I'm on this sub so I'm obviously concerned with aesthetics, but I also want to get stronger and become a better athlete. I unfortunately have terrible eating habits, so I have not yet been able to actually lose those 10 lbs. For various reasons, the best I have been able to do is stick to a diet regimen for about a week, then I implode. I don't have a problem sticking with the IF protocol. I often go 20+ hours w/o food. My problem is stopping eating once I stop. And fighting my cravings/""hunger."" But this post is not about my eating habits. 

Fortunately, I've had much more success in the gym than in the kitchen. I was doing a variation of SL5x5 for a while, but for the last 3 months I've been doing the actual thing. My strength has increased substantially. I'm up to 

* 165x5x5 bench

* 190x5x5 squat (shaky form)

* 275x5x1 deadlift

* 105x5x5 OHP 

I still weigh around 155 lbs but I definitely have some more muscle now than I did 3 months ago. It's noticeable in my shoulders and arms. I was initially going to stick to SL5x5 until all my lift numbers were well into the intermediate range on [strength standards](http://www.strstd.com/). 

However, there are a few things now that are making me question that decision. First, there is 31minutes's AMA that discourages high volume training, especially when on a cut. In fact, [someone asked him about 5x5 specifically](http://www.reddit.com/r/leangains/comments/1jjrci/former_berkhan_client_ama/cbfyt85
), and he was adamantly against it. I was personally skeptical of a guy who does an AMA and provides no proof (not even to mods), but his advice in regards to dieting seemed logical and everyone else on this sub seemed to buy into all that he was saying, so I'm giving his advice some serious thought. At the same time, I'm starting to stall on SL5x5. It's become very hard to add weight every workout onto my bench, OHP, and squat especially. DL is still going up, but I'm sure it will stall soon as well. 

I want some advice/opinions on whether I should stick to SL5x5, or try for the RPT based routine that 31minutes outlined and that everyone else has bought into. Should I stick SL5x5 to capitalize on n00bgainz? Or have my n00bgainz already materialized, as exhibited by my stalling? Should I switch to SL3x5 instead to eek out some more strength gains? How does the fact that I've been *attempting* to eat at a deficit for 3 months affect this? (I was typically eating ~1500 kcal during the week, and an unplanned surplus on weekends. So it was probably around or slight above maintenance for the week. My maintenance is ~2100 according to the calculation method 31minutes gave us) Could it be that my stall is a result of eating at a deficit during most of the week? Or is just a classic stall that people have with SL5x5, meaning that I just need to keep at it? 

And for what it's worth, my last few SL5x5 workouts have left me brutally sore. The work weights I've been putting up for the squat are the highest I've ever done and they've been extremely difficult/taxing. I did 190, failed at 195, went back to 190 and failed that. These last 3 workouts plus the heavy deadlifts I did at the end of two of them have left my entire back and posterior chain sore for multiple days. Perhaps the volume is too high for a cut ...

[Progress Pics](http://imgur.com/a/PEriB#0)

I started working out my freshman year of college after I gained the freshman 15 in just one semester. It took 3 years of fucking around to realize that I wasn't where I wanted to be physically. I did some crossfit here and there and focused exclusively on barbell training but still never hit the point where I was satisfied aesthetically. My upper body (shitty genetics) was never on the same level as my lower body.

At the end of January this year, I decided to stop making excuses and stick to a program that made sense. Leangains was the answer and I fully committed to giving it a whirl for 3 months. After a month of getting used to the program, it became extremely easy to incorporate into my day to day life and I stuck with it for another 3.

Things that I wanted: more arm definition, a bigger / fuller chest and abs. I added a little bit of direct arm work towards the end of my stint to focus more and I think it shows.

Note that I did indeed lose weight though my strength / numbers went up dramatically. For the first 4 months, I stuck to the program and stayed at the same weight. However, in the last 2, my weight fluctuated due to a breakup (loss of appetite) and traveling for work, so I couldn't stick to the program as rigidly as I would have liked.

**Stats:**

   * 24M / 5' 11""
   * Weight: 170 lbs -&gt; 166
   * ~2800 cals burned / day - I'm fairly active

**Lifts:**

I leg pressed instead of squatting (don't really enjoy squatting) and didn't really do a good job of tracking my progress. Also, I did a fair amount of dumbbell work as I found it to be more effective in terms of carryover to bench. My stabilizer muscles strengthened dramatically which directly correlated to my higher bench press.

The numbers listed for DB exercises below are for each DB.

   * Deadlift 1RM : 385 -&gt; 410
   * Leg Press 1RM : 520

   * Bench 1RM: 220 -&gt; 250
   * DB Bench (1x8) : 90 (each) -&gt; 100
   * DB Seated Press (1x8) : 65 (each) -&gt; 75
   * DB One-Arm Row (1x10) : 95 (each) -&gt; 110
   * Weighted Chin Up (1x5) : BW + 65 lbs -&gt; BW + 82.5 lbs
   * Weighted Dips (1x5) : BW + 90 lbs -&gt; BW + 110

**Diet:**

I only followed the diet during the weekdays and pretty much ate normally on the weekends. Also, I only worked out twice a week, which meant that I only ""carbed up"" twice a week. 

Workout Days - On workout days, I found it difficult to eat as much as I needed, so I used a shake to supplement. I know Martin advises against this, but it was really great for me. One shake = 2 cups milk, 2 scoops of whey, 1 banana, 1 cup ice cream = ~900 calories

   * 3300 cals
   * ~500 g carbs
   * ~180-200 g protein

Non-workout days - On these days I only walked and didn't engage in any high intensity exercise. I would just take a break during work and walk around the park for 20 minutes, 2x per day. Helped me hit my goals.

   * ~2200 cals
   * ~200-220 g protein
   * Sub 100 g carbs

**Routine:**

I incorporated Martin's RPT model with my own modifications. It worked for me and may or may not work for you.

Day 1 - 

   * DB Bench Press - 1x3-5, 1x8-10
   * Barbell Bench (subbed for the second DB set every other week) 1x8-10
   * Weighted Chins - 1x3-5, 1x8-10, 1xfatigue
   * Seated Cable Row - 2x10-12
   * Cable Crunch - 2x15

Day 2 - 

   * Deadlift - 1x3-5, 1x8-10
   * Leg Press - 1x3-5, 1x8-10 (did this exercise on and off)
   * Weighted Dips - 1x3-5, 1x8-10
   * One Arm Row - 2x10
   * Face Pulls - 2x12
   * Chin Up - 2x15
   * Dip Station Leg Raise - 2x20

**Tools I Used:**

   * Fitocracy - My main tool for tracking progress. Excellent to keep on target with your numbers.
   * MyFitnessPal - Enough said.
   * Nike Fuelband - This was actually really great to track my daily caloric expenditure. Wasn't necessarily the most accurate, but it provided me enough information to work with. Usually was within +/- 100-200 calories

**What I Learned:**

Through this process, I really learned how important it is to choose a program that fits your lifestyle. Leangains really was the most flexible option for me and it worked. Yeah, I could've achieved my results in a much quicker time frame but to be honest I have a busy schedule and I need flexibility. My weekends are full of socializing, and so the weekdays were the only days I had to work with.

Also, people will scoff at you, be impressed or just think you're crazy. Don't listen to them. STICK to a program and just run with it. I didn't really see results until the end of month 2. I can't tell you the looks I got from people when I stuffed my face with cinnamon toast crunch or ice cream. 

Finally - lean gains really can be a lifestyle diet. I can't really tell you whether or not IF was what made the big difference, but I can tell you that IF helps you adhere to the program. Eating that much food in such a short period of time keeps you full even if you're eating under.

**Going Forward:**

In the next 6 months I plan to get back to around 170. Not sure where I stand bodyfat wise currently but I'd like to be at 10%, so I'll probably have to get tested. **edit** - can someone give me an estimate on where I stand BF% wise?

Is this a deal breaker?,24,6,46,http://www.reddit.com/r/leangains/comments/1e386u/please_advise_im_on_a_cut_and_totally_able_to/,"Details: 5'11, 29yo male, 166lbs.  I'm following a -30/-10 cut with, 16/8 IF protocol.

I'm about 2 weeks into trying this IF/LG lifestyle.  I record EVERYTHING with MFP.  I eat around 1400 calories on rest days and 1800 calories on workout days.

From what I understand, my macros (set at 50/50) ideally should be...

* Protein 40% (~140g)
* Carbs 30% (~100g)
* Fat 30% (~50g)

**But the reality is more like...**

* Protein 21% (ETA: about 90g)
* Carbs 52%
* Fat 27%

As you can see, I have trouble keeping the protein high and the carbs low relative to each other.  I don't eat meat or fish too often.  I get most of my protein from beans, lentils, legumes, quinoa and things like that.  I'm not a vegetarian, but it turns out to be that way for most of my days.  I don't have a problem avoiding fatty foods as I eat plenty of fruits and vegetables everyday.  Overall my diet is hella clean IMO.

I find the IF protocol to be extremely conducive to my productivity and lifestyle and makes calorie-restriction very, very easy.  I just fail at actually being able to stick to a low carb or keto diet (believe me I have tried) on rest-days.

* **So anyway, are there any red-flags to what I'm doing?**
* **Is this going to make fat-loss or muscle gain slower?**

PS: I have broken a month-long plateau with this IF/LG diet and have already lost a couple pounds at least in the past 2 weeks so I will surely be continuing.  **I'm just wondering how the protein/carb discrepancy is going to play out in the long run.  Thanks!**

ETA: In lieu of all the suggestions to eat more protein powder, protein bars, meat and pork, I just wanted to say I don't eat those things because I simply don't enjoy them.  (I rather have nutrient-dense, ""real"" food with fiber any day over some protein powder.  You feel me?) I'm not against meat, although I'm not crazy about it.  I love the fat free Greek yogurt and eggs idea.  I thank ALL of you for the suggestions, it's much appreciated, however, **I would still want to know what the consequences are with my current diet more than anything else if anyone could speak from experience or point to articles.  And am I miscalculating carbs? Should I be looking at *Net* carbs [total carbs - fiber] and not total carbs? (Since I eat lots of fiber)**

------------------------------------------------------

___Thank you all for your responses___ 

ITT I Learned The Following Changes to make for rest days:

* My diet should be set up around my protein intake: ""Your thought about every meal should start with your protein source, the rest comes after.""
* Eat more Eggs. 
* Get some 0% Fat Greek Yogurt.
* Low Fat Cottage Cheese is much cheaper though (I will mix in some blueberries and be in cottage cheese heaven).
* More meat/chicken/fish up in this bitch.
* Save the quinoa, beans, lentils, legumes for workout-days (they're high in protein, low in fat, but high in carbs).

I said before that I would try cutting first. I couldn't make any gains at all, and since I'm new to lifting I think that's more important. So I went on a 3.5 week bulk and made really nice noob gains, then I've tried to cut off the fat for the past two weeks. Actually though, I don't feel like there's a huge difference. How do I get abs? Do I need to add more ab work, or is my bf% still too high?

Anyways, here are the pics. I assume if you are about to click on fitness progress pics, you are aware that there is soft-core NSFW potential.

another line is the Grill that puts out variations of cheeseburgers and hamburgers and chicken sandwhiches.

Another line has Pasta with red sauce and red meat sauce.

I want to get stronger and sculpt a better body.

When I first started lifting, I didn't want to inhibit muscle growth and didn't know the right way to go about it, so I just started eating way more food.  I jumped from 49kg-51kg in 3 weeks.  I heard about LG and decided to cut down so I could see what was underneath.  After 1 week on a -30/-10 cut I'm 50kg.  Not sure if I should cut just a bit more, or if it's time to lean bulk with a -10/+20?  Or recomp?

There is very little info out there for girls it seems, so I've been looking through the progress pic posts on here and they aren't that helpful for me.  Any advice (plus a body fat % estimation) would be awesome.  I'm pumped about this new lifestyle!

**edit:**
I've decided to keep up the -30/-10 for another week.  If I feel like I need more energy on workout days, or if I feel like my lifts are suffering too much, I'll switch to -30/+10.  Losing 2kg seems like it will put me at roughly 18% body fat, and hopefully I can reach this goal by the end of March (6 weeks).

What Gives? ,25,8,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/leangains/comments/11mtbq/5_months_of_bulking_incredibly_slow_strength/,"So I just completed 5 months of a slow bulk. I hate to give my life's story before I get to the meat of this post, but I think its relevant in this case. Anyways, a little over a year ago I had finished cutting to 185 from 240 lbs using SL 5x5 and counting my calories. However, entering college for the first time I decided this wasn't enough. I started the Anabolic Diet (basically 5 days no carbs then a huge carb load on the weekend) and attempted to cut fast and hard to get abs. I screwed it up and lost a lot of muscle and strength. My weight dropped to 160 but my squat dropped 265-230, my bench dropped 155-135, and my deadlift dropped 290-245. Finally around the start of February I saw the light and started LeanGains. Over 3 months of LG I managed to drop another 5 lbs or so to 156, and regained some of my muscle and strength.

This May I began bulking. My 5 month anniversary, if you will, was yesterday, and I took some time to evaluate my progress.

Age: 19
Height: 5'11""
Weight: 156-167 (note that the first 4 lbs were a rapid water weight gain that happened over a week).
Body Fat: I have gained a small amount. Nothing horrible though.
Muscle: I guess it's been okay. I have put just under an inch on my arms, and I think my back and chest are significantly thicker. However, if you didn't see me between starting my bulk and now you certainly wouldn't be wowed or anything. Unless you had a good knowledge of my physique beforehand and I was wearing a tight shirt you probably wouldn't notice anything beyond me being a little thicker in the chest and back region.

Squat 235-270 lbs (7 lbs a month gain)
Bench 145-165 lbs (4 lbs a month gain)
Press 110-125 lbs (3 lbs a month gain)
Deadlift 270-330 lbs (12 lbs a month gain)
Dips BW + 25-50 (5 lbs a month)
Chins BW + 2.5-30 (5 lbs a month)
I train in the 4-6 rep range for my top set, 6-8 for my second, and 8-12 for the bottom set.
Note that given numbers are 5rms.

So from looking at this, its clear to me that a. I'm barely an intermediate lifter, and b. Strength gains have been extremely slow. 

**My Routine:**

Monday:
Squats 3 sets RPT
OHP 3 sets RPT
Front Squats 3x5

Wednesday:
Bench Press 3 sets RPT
Dips 3 sets RPT
Incline Pushups 3 sets

**Diet**: Still Following LG.

WO day :
3400 calories
240g protein
85g fat
430g carbs

Rest Day:
2600 calories 
215g protein
150g carbs

I follow this pretty damn consistently and hit my protein goals 19/20 days and if I don't hit my calories its always from me going over my goals.

**Other Important Stuff**

I sleep about 7-8 hours a night. My numbers have basically remained the same for the past 1.5 month since I came to university. My first workout I had to drop weight by 5-10 lbs on every lift (especially upper body) and I couldn't do Deadlifts until I ordered some chalk since they didn't have it here. Since then I got my Squat up to 10 lbs above where I started when I came to school, my bench and DL 5 lbs, but my press has barely moved more than a rep or two on my top set. I have no idea why I had to drop the weight so much. The bars are much thinner here, but not much heavier. It also took me about two weeks to lock my diet in again with the switch to university food. 

I have another 5 months of bulking planned, and I want to make the most of it. I see people around here making faster strength progress than me, at a more advanced level, on a damn cut, and I think my strength ought to be coming a hell of a lot faster than it is. How can I make this happen? Is my diet the issue? My training?

I've thought about this for a while and I honestly can't figure out the issue. I go as hard as I possibly can in the gym each workout and try my heart out to get more reps and use more weight. In my mind my diet and training routine are great. The only thing I can think of is that this summer and now I have a very exhausting life. This summer I worked a highly active outdoors job and was constantly doing stuff with my friends as well. Now at school I have classes from 9-6 3 days of the week and study from when I get back till midnight or later every night except Friday. Its probably worth mentioning I've been getting sick a lot more over the past 5 months than I used to as well. This is extremely frustrating. 

So, any and all help is appreciated. I give you major props if you read that whole thing.

*Fasted Workouts* with 10g of Xtend consumed before lifting, sometimes with NO Xplode. Since I'm on a deficit, the Xplode really helps with lifting heavy. I prefer a cup of coffee to the Xplode, though. 

Meals [Training Days]

**Post Workout**:

2 scoops whey

2 diced 4 oz chicken breats on 6 inch whole wheat sub

1 Chug 1% fat chocolate milk

**Meal 2**:

4 diced chicken breasts with Zest sauce
Red peppers, brocolli, etc with Italian dressing

**Meal 3**:

2 chicken breasts, cottage cheese + whey to make up difference. I try to get as many of my macros from whole foods, but being in college in all, it's not always possible.

Note: Since I'm not at a very low BF level yet, I like to cycle my carb intake. For example, 150-200g on Monday (post workout, preferably), 100g after Wed session, and 50g on Friday (it's low because that's also my drinking night).

&gt; But I'm Keto

&gt; Carbs are an essential part of muscle building. Starchy carbs are great for building muscle. Read what Lyle McDonald says about that. Carbs can make you fat ... if you overfeed on carbs chronically (we are talking about 700g+ a day for many days).

In Lyle's article, there really isn't any mention of starch or muscle. So where does this whole ""eat starchy carbs to help build muscle"" come from? Considering that potatoes are ranked as one of the most fattening foods you can eat (pretty sure they're number one), starchy carbs seem like a bad idea. 

Edit: what I've taken away so far: 

- protein after a workout is critical 
- replenishing glycogen stores after a workout is important
- to get protein into your muscle cells you'll need insulin 
- starchy carbs are a great source of glucose which spikes insulin and replenishes glycogen

I've lost a lot of weight just doing 20 minutes of exercise, but I want more now.  I haven't actually watched what I was eating till about 4 months ago and I tracked every thing that went in and out and it's getting very annoying eating a bunch of small meals.  This style of life that is Leangains and the work out that's recommended for it sounds a lot less stressful for my current busy life.  I just want to make sure I'm hitting the macros I'm suppose to be.   I want to make this a life style change, not just a diet change.

So w/ lifting I'd like to do Chin-Ups, bench, squat, deadlift, dips, overhead press and calf raises.  Now is there any thing I need to add or take out?  Also I like the idea of doing RPT were you go 3-5 rep max then 6-8 then 8-12 if I understand that correctly.  

Now currently I weigh around 135 lbs and I think I'm around 12% BF.  I want my abs to show I want every thing to show so I'm assuming I need to be on a cut?  Now in terms of calories I've only been eating around 1300-1500 a day because I'm 5'4"".  I do eat 135G protein minimum every day and try to keep my fat around 40.  My fat some times is really low and my carbs have always been low, too low tbh.  What is y'alls recommendation for my Macros and if any thing sounds off about what I've said so far please rip me a knew one. I want to learn and some times the best way is harsh.  I just want to gain the knowledge that you guys have.  Also I've been doing Cardio for a really long time so I'm sure I'll be ok if I just straight up stop, but what about just like 20 minutes here and there just to make sure I got it still?

Unlike the first transformation I'll take a bunch of pics and get all the measurements.  I have a accumeasure, but that says I'm 9.5% bf which I don't believe because I still have no relax'd abs and stomach fat at the bottom.

I just got into a huge argument with them, which essentially concluded with, ""Fine, go ahead and do your weird weight-loss program, but when you get sick don't come running to us."" They used a variety of arguments:

* The program goes against ""common sense"".
* Having diabetes in the family, eating a very large meal will set me up to have insulin/blood sugar spikes, which will cause me to get diabetes.
* I'm at home so I should to eat by their rules.
* Chinese tradition says that the best way of eating is with very small and very frequent meals.
* I shouldn't skip breakfast.
* I shouldn't eat after dinner.

I've taken my recent cut extremely slowly, and I'm about 5 months in now. I've lost likely just under 20 lbs over the course of that time, and I don't believe I've lost much if any muscle, and I haven't lost any strength except on bench and OHP, which was due to a wrist injury anyways. 

I have seen obvious results in my body, but as this cut wears on I'm starting to worry a bit about the long term effects of living in a caloric deficit. We talk a lot about leptin and other hormones that get affected by eating at a deficit, and I'm beginning to wonder if having this cut drag on so long could become a detriment to my progress.

Basically what I'm asking is it worth 1. Deciding I'm lean enough and starting a bulk for a while 2. taking a break for 1-2 weeks and eating at maintenance or 3. decreasing my calories hard and trying to just finish this damn cut up. 

Or should I just continue onward as is and be patient? I have no clue how long it may take to reach my goal of 8-10% bf as I've never been as lean as I am now, but it seems like I have very little fat at all left other than some on my lower abs (I know that sounds like such a fitness noob thing to say but it honestly is how my body carries fat). I have striations on my back, legs, shoulders and chest. I really can't give you guys a body fat estimate either due to a bit of loose skin from when I was fat screwing up readings from fat calipers. If I had to hazard a guess though I'd say I'm around 12%.

Instead of just one fruit, I used raspberries and blueberries, nothing more:

100g raspberries
100g blueberries
1 scoop ON vanilla cream whey powder

Crush the berries, add the protein, beat and whisk until fluffy.

A while back, I posted my major lift numbers. My squat and deadlift were not quite what the internet says they should be. I argued pretty vehemently with some people about the numbers. They *were* accurate. The problem was that I didn't realize that my squat was probably not acceptable... the form was great, but I was stopping at just below 90 degrees. I had always assumed that going any lower than parallel was wrong. For the past week, I have been working on doing full squats with our school's weight coach. We started out with light weight to get the form in line. Yesterday was my first time looking for a new weight range for squats. A very humbling experience. So my new numbers:

* Squat: 185 x 5
* OHD: 135 x 6
* Bench: 225 x 7
* Deadlift: 235 x 7

I'm 5'9"", currently 180 pounds, working on getting back down to 170.

I do have a substantially stronger upper body as compared to lower body. This is partially due to genetics and partially due to years of playing favorites (another thing LG saved me from).

**SO ANYWAY: SORRY TO THOSE I ARGUED AGAINST**

2) When you're cutting, how low do you get your carbs (other than veggie sources- I eat cucumbers and broccoli) on rest days? Or do you even bother with worrying about them in favor of keeping overall calories as low as possible?

3) Someone mentioned using compression and full range of movement on joints. I keep thinking they said ""voodoo"" something, and I found resources for this, but I wanted to make sure that was what I had read.

So far I'm on week 4 and I don't find the fasting hard, I do find the low calories on rest day difficult though. 

I've been following a pretty strict meal plan of:

Rest day: 
M1: 200g Tuna, 200g vegies, 100g Cottage cheese. Dinner, 200g chicken, 200g vegies. M3 1 protein pancake or 1 egg/2 whites.
Snacks, usually 50g of cashews.

W/O Day:
M1: 200g chicken, 200g vegies. (workout): PWO shake, 200g chicken, 200g veggies, usually here it gets a bit dicey, but I'll have several slices of wheat toast with my meal, or white rice. M3: Protein pancake and one or two scoops low fat ice cream.
Snacks: maybe a cookie, or one or two lollies after the workout.

I've consistently hit my macros every day, but after four weeks, I see a difference, but it's marginal and to be honest at this time of year it's been really hard. I've avoided all alcohol, at work functions I program my macros on the fly after light lunches etc, but I've made it work. 

My lifts have progressed which is nice, but since I was lifting before hands my gains have been marginal. 

It's been a fair bit of effort, I just want to make sure I'm doing the right thing, because right now I'm not sure it's worth it.

Am I too high BF % to be on a recomp (20/20)? 

I know it's slow, but I'm struggling to stay motivated considering I feel like I've given up a fair amount in the four weeks, while in my wifes words ""Haven't really changed at all"".

From my 6th month to current I lost some definition. What I gain is size which isn't noticeable in the pictures but more in my measurements. Gained 0.75"" in arm size, traps lats are getting bigger, and my waist is 31.25"" from 31"". 

My diet hasn't been the best since I picked up extra units this semester and working very little hours. My protein is 100-150g a day. Majority of my carbs is white rice. Workout days 40-50g of fat. Rest days 90-100g of fat. Foodwise is mostly anything within my macros. Drank soda, eat a bunch of junk food, pretty much whatever I have or anything that is offered to me. I gained more than I planned. There has been couple weekends of parties where I end up over eating but I kept my limit to +10 on rest or +50 on workout days. Since I figure my potential LBM gain I can achieve I will slight lower my workout days to +35 to keep at about 0.5lb a week. Will be cycling back to cut in end of March and at the end of summer back to another bulk. Rinse and repeat until I reach my goal. My goal is to be 160s with sub 10% which will probably take another 2 years to complete.

Is it a practicality thing, since obviously it would take a little more effort to hit macros without dipping into carbs/fats hardly at all depending on the day?  Anyone have any thoughts on this?

Similarly, I understand the importance behind people saying ""Eat whatever you want, just make sure you're hitting your macros"", but does that hold true for the ""off-macros"" as well, e.g., fat on workout day?  It's pretty easy for me to be 20-30g of fat short on a workout day when I'm sticking to delicious but lowfat stuff like chicken breast, nonfat cottage cheese, and brown rice, and I typically go to bed not caring that I didn't fulfill an ""off-macro"".

Edit: Maybe I was a bit hasty in writing this.  I tried using the Search for an answer and only made this post when I couldn't find this topic, but I just stumbled upon the following from [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/leangains/comments/zwc90/fat_on_rest_days/):

&gt; [–]beerandconcrete 2 points 2 days ago*

&gt; You're at a deficit on your rest days, so everything you're eating gets burned.

&gt; However, we prioritize fat over carbs on rest days to keep insulin and blood glucose levels low to promote fat burning.

&gt; If you want to skip carbs altogether on rest days, you go right on ahead.""

Is skipping carbs altogether being okay the consensus?  And, in that case, is skipping fat on workout days equally permissable?

Second Edit: And then the thought occurs to me that if I do use an IF calculator to determine my ""on-macros"", should I substitute the fat/carbs that I'm skipping with more calories from the macros that I'm prioritizing?

However, hear me out:

* Carbs become more important the leaner you get and therefore the more insulin sensitive you are;
* Yes, we need carbs to fuel muscle growth, but do we really need 300g + carbs on workout days? Leangains style workout plans are not exactly that taxing compared to high volume or HIIT workouts - is there really that much glycogen depletion?;
* Should we really be looking at calories and macros on a daily basis or, rather, on a weekly basis? If we eat calories above our TDEE on a workout day, but then are in deficit over a week, does it really matter if the calories on that workout day were comprised of more fat than the leangains approach suggests? Does the body react that quickly to excess calories from fat? 

The above is more in relation to recomp/cuts. Curious to hear your thoughts and as to whether you think  those with higher bf% (14% and above) would have more success keeping carbs lower at the outset (perhaps 150g max on workout days) and then gradually increasing carbs/decreasing fat intake on workout days as the trainee becomes leaner.

Before: http://imgur.com/XhO849q
After 3 months of leangains: http://imgur.com/Pfqltxh

Results aren't the greatest, but I'm happy with the pace I'm losing weight.

Height: 5'10
Weight pre-leangains: 205.5 lbs
Weight as of right now: 185.5 although I was as low as 183.0, but due to drinking and binging over the weekend I'm still carrying a lil extra water weight. I'm just happy to be consistantly under 190 lbs.
Also went from a 37in waist to 34.5in

**Current Lifts(all max 1 rep)**
Bench: 230 lbs /
Squat: 335 lbs /
Deadlifts: 405 lbs /
Military Press: 160 lbs /

I started off doing RPT with 2-3 accessory exercises, currently 3 weeks into Wendlers 5/3/1 due to my bench having stalled for the past 6 months. My form was pure shit before and I've been working on it and feel a difference benching now. Hopefully I can boost those numbers. 

**Diet**

Started off doing -40/20, currently on -30/10. I cheat every 3 weeks and follow it up with a 36 hour fast. I mostly estimate and eyeball everything. I haven't been that meticulous with my macros since I've been losing weight at a good rate, but I might start getting a little more strict now that summer is just around the corner.

Short term goals: Drop to 173.0 lbs and recomp.
Long term goals: Hit 1200 lbs total in the big 3, then switch to oly lifts.

I was hell bent on getting a 6 pack before summer hit, but I'm unsure if I'll get there this year. I do know I can drop those extra 10 lbs and be leaner than I've ever been in 15 years. The most important thing I've learned here is the road I'm taking is a marathon and not a sprint, meaning there are no shortcuts and to enjoy the scenery along the way.

A bit of history about myself now,  I have been going to the gym on and off since I was 21! I am now 34!! I have a young daughter and expecting another in a few months also have a busy stressful job which means I some time have to go away on business for a couple of days at a time so certainly not ideal to make maximum strength/muscle gains.  Over the last 12 years I have basically made little progress due to no focus on diet or big compound exercise and doing CV that I had no need to do and having 6 months-year brakes at a time.  In 2012 basically did nothing got fat my weight up to about 168 pounds (am 5’8”) my 32-34” waist clothes didn’t fit me and at which point in July last year started doing dumbbell, press-ups and pullup workouts at home.  September time found out about IF and leangains and started trying to incorporate it.  October went on holiday for three weeks.  November was about 150lbs, joined a gym and started doing squat, deadlift, chest press and pull ups 2-3 times a week and started to watch my macros.

I am now 139lbs and probably about 10-12% BF and waist is 29.5”.  I am so much happier with my body than I was this time last year.  My lifts have made slow progress while cutting but am now at a point where I am quite happy with my leanness (my Mrs says she doesn’t want me to lose any more weight!! So need to put on some lean mass before I lose more BF to keep her happy!! ;) ) 

So I am now going to do a -10/+25% for the next few weeks and see how I go if I don’t put on too much fat will raise to -10/+30%.  Macros are here: [IMG]http://i.imgur.com/4rQ1XvG.png[/IMG]

Am I too fat to be here?

I read the FAQs in the sidebar, and if I'm understanding you correctly, LG was designed to help you lose the last 10% of bodyfat. However, it can also be used for big fat guys (like me) to lose weight while still gaining strength. 

The last time I went on a straight-up calorie deficit diet (~1500 per day) my strength disappeared almost overnight. So I let my diet slide and started getting good gains- and gained another 20lbs in the process. 

So now I'm about 225-230lbs, and I assume I should be somewhere south of 200. And I don't know if lean gains can get me there, but I think it can. 

Right now I'm following the strict +20%/-20% system, working to get all my macros down. I'm eating only within 8 hours per day, and trying to get most of that in right after I workout. If I'm understanding correctly, I should eat simple carbs (read: sugar) after working out. So in addition to my protein shake, it would be smart to eat some frosted flakes (for example). Do I have this right? Or should I be eating whole grain rice type carbs?

I'm breaking my fast with a small meal (~25% of daily cal) then digest for an hour, then workout, then eat a huge meal (~50%). I save the last bit for a small dinner ~500 cals (mostly paleo type stuff). 

I'm all sorts of confused, combining lean gains with 5/3/1 and paleo and about a dozen other competing systems in my head. 

I'm hoping you'll take pity on me and indulge my questions. Thanks in advance. ",,False,,t5_2saqe,False,,,True,t3_tbm0j,http://www.reddit.com/r/leangains/comments/tbm0j/am_i_too_fat_to_be_here_bf_20/,

I'm not vouching that it exists, or doesn't exist, but I did find this study that shows after six months of being on a sub maintenance diet, the volume of daily sedentary calories burned dropped by 110-130 per person in the study.

Been doing LG/IF for around 3 weeks, trying multiple different variations of macros.  My goal is to cut down my body fat for the summer, maintain/""recomp"" during the summer, then bulk and cut after the summer.


**Weekly Schedule**

So I'm back on a 5x per week lifting schedule.  I actually do a 3 on, 1 off, so I'm really on a 4 day cycle meaning I don't have specific workouts on each day of the week.  The routine is a 3 day split mix of strength and hypertrophy and the workouts range from an hour and 20, to 2 hours (I don't do any 'cardio' or running or anything like that, though I do play 10-20 hours of beach volleyball per week).  I know this is not necessary, and even slightly detrimental to a cut, but I do it because I love it.  My workouts are like therapy, and give me a sense of pleasure like no other!  An average week might look like this (yes I'm aware it looks like I do 6x a week because of the 3 on 1 off, but thats only week 1 that looks like that):


*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

**Monday** Evening Lift

*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

[-30 -15](http://i.imgur.com/FArGpW1.png)


So I've read varying opinions on cutting while being as active as I am... some people say you need to eat more, some people say you need to eat less on workout days because the lack of rest days.  I have no problems keeping my energy levels up (without any real stims) through the week.  When lifting fasted I take BCAAs before, during, and after my workouts.


So, what do you guys recommend? Do things look good? Should I eat more? Change the cycling on rest/workout days?

**Cut**
My cut lasted from 21/1/13 to 18/2/13. I lost a bit of strength I, but my squat results aren't accurate because I squatted with a smith machine previously, but started learning free weight squats about 1 week before working with Andy. I ate about 1300cals on off days and 1700cals on workout days.

**Bulk**
My bulk started from 18/2/13 to 15/4/13. I gained weight, but from my pictures, I don't really see much muscle growth or strength gains :( However, my measurements have increased throughout my body but it might be just fat gains..... During the bulk I did GSLP, but my squats didn't progress as fast as I hoped for, and I had to reset it twice in 8 weeks. By the end of my bulk (last 4 weeks) I was eating 1700cals on off days and 2700cals on workout days.

I've been very successful on this cut, and have gone from 187 lbs down to 177 lbs in about 5 weeks.  I've gotten some comments from colleagues and my wife that they felt I was getting too skinny.

Of course, this very well may limit your end run fat-loss/strength goals if you do this frequently.

I updated this to work with lb/kg. I was hoping to get it to be something that you could switch on the spreadsheet, but that was proving to be a real pain. So, now it's going to be a bit more work for you to switch it from lb to kg. 

Steps: 

1. make a copy of the sheet
1. alter the stuff in _blue_ on the Sources sheet first; mess with stuff outside of that and things might not work right, up to you
1. if you need it to use kg, do this
  1. Tools menu, Script Editor
  1.  in Code.gs, change line 1 from: 
       `var _useKg = false;` 
    to 
    `var _useKg = true;`
  1. save and close the file  
  1. numbers should update automatically; if they don't try changing a target weight (col F)

Questions/errors, let me know ITT. 

If anyone knows google sheet really well and has some pointers for getting a kg/lb switch working well without timeout errors, let me know.

They say they train fasted, which i have also been doing, but they then go onto say they wait up-to and over 2 hours post work before eating. This enable your body to use more fat and take advantage of natural gh that occure during and after working out. 

This really does seem counter to everything else i have been taught. (all be it by the guys in the gym)

Is this ok to do? because it really suits me to train first thing and then wait a few hours beofre breaking my fast. In fact it seems to good to be true as it would be a perfect fit for me, guess that's why i am posting here in the hopes you guys say its OK :)

Workout day nutrition is obvious: eat most food post-workout and eat high carbs/low fat to produce a large insulin response for maximum transport of amino acids into cells/minimum transport of fats into cells.

Rest day nutrition is slightly more subtle in that a) carbs aren't very important and b) muscle synthesis peaks at 24 hours post workout. So eat a giant, fatty, protein-laden meal to break the fast and ensure a giant amino acid surge right at 24 hours.

So in a traditional MWF workout schedule, you want bursts of protein on TuThSa, roughly 20-24 hours after each respective workout. The question I have is about Sunday. As far as I can tell, there isn't anything particularly important about Sunday. Sure, muscle synthesis may still be elevated from my massive squat workout on Friday, but is there any reason to not eat very little on Sunday? My feeding window is 1 PM - 9 PM; could I eat a 120 g/protein meal at 1:00 PM and fast until Monday at 1:00 PM? That way I eat minimal calories (roughly 1,000) on the relatively unimportant Sunday to aid my cut along while not sacrificing gains.

I'm following the LG protocol since June and had a great deal of fun while cutting (-20/0, 63kg/138lbs) until September, when I started a -20/+20 recomposition after having reached circa 8/9% bodyfat. Problem is *I would seem unable to withstand large quantities of carbohydrates*. Let me tell ya in details.

Best mental / physical health I've ever experienced was when I didn't eat what I was supposed to, in late 2010. I ate approximately 2.5g worth of protein per kilo (160-170g) and an equivalent amount of carbs (about 1:1 ratio or a little more if I wanted to) with 0.9-1g/kg of fat. That was obviously a slight form of undereating, but I felt really well. As time went on, I tried to up the calories as many had told me to, but the more carbs I tried to fit in, the shittier I felt - enter LG and the actual -20/+20 recomp. When I'm on the +20 day I'm floored, I feel extremely drowsy, sluggish and generally like crap.

Details as follows:

**Infos**  
**Height**: 171cm / 5'7""  
**Weight**: 65kg / 143lbs  
**Age and sex**: 27, male  
**Activity level**: sedentary (with a 3-day split)  
**Body fat (eyeballed)**: 12-13% (from 8-9% in September)  
  
**Rest day:** 1514kcal, 54g carbs / 163g pro / 72g fat  
**WO day:** 2272kcal, 314g carbs / 163g pro / 40g fat  

In about six weeks I went from being, like, alert and fine (with a low bodyfat and great muscle definition) to a sluggish, drowsy piece of crap (with higher bodyfat). Plainly, I can't seem to stand carbs. I'm thinking of having a two weeks reset eating at TDEE and exercising, but using a different macro distribution (1893kcal / 165g carbs / 163g pro / 65g fat) and see how it goes... but I remain pretty baffled.

**Lifts(old gains/new gains)**
Note that most of these gains are mostly due to muscle memory rather than anything else. Also, I was on creatine while cutting which had a benefit as well. Not that impressive.

DB Bench Press(80x7/80x5-6)
DB Shoulder Press(50x6/60x6)
Box Squat(175x8/225x6)
Deadlift(175x7/245x6)Form improved also
I stopped doing pulldowns
Pullups(Bw x 3/BWx5-6)
Chinups(Bw x 2 or 3/BW x 7 or 8 not on a back day, 6-7 hard reps on Back day)
Dips(BW x 9/ +25x8/+35x4-5)

So no real improvements when it came to my bench press or shoulder press. I'm doing OHP now, so we'll see how that comes along. Dips and Pull up improvements came from probably weight loss.

Supps
The only supplements I took were Jack3d for preworkout and Green Magnitude Creatine by Controlled Labs. I used those two from start of my log, and still on it. I had a brief period of time where i ran out of creatine, and my lifts dropped some. But I'm back on it now. I think maybe like 3-4 weeks ago, I started taking a multivitamin and fish oil. I don't know if that contributed at all.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

For the first 2 months, I went on a -20/0 split. I set my activity level to sedentary since I was only working out 3 times a week. Then the final month and 3 weeks, I set it to -30/0. I didn't see a lot of progress this past 2 weeks tho, because my parents are celebrating ramadan and they think I am too(I'm not), so my whole eating schedule is fucked up. I pretty much did RPT on all of my lifts, unless it was accessory work. My lifting routine was just:

**Day 1:**

Box Squats

Calf Raises(acc)

HyperExtensions

Pullups


-

**Day 2:**

Bench Press

DB Press/OHP

Dips 


-

**Day 3:**

Deadlift

Kroc DB Rows

Chinups

-----------------------------




Overall, I'm fine with my progress. I'm glad I lost the weight, but I wish more fat came off. I didn't do a good job of tracking my carbs or fats. All I made sure was that I hit my calorie marker, and I at least got 200g's of protein. I also got most of my protein from whey shakes, which I didn't really enjoy. Hopefully when Ramadan ends I can buy a lot of meat for myself. 

As of the future, I think I might continue cutting. I really want to get rid of these man boobs, and all of this fat on my lower back. I think also I'm gonna start taking better notes regarding my macros. Unless you guys suggest doing a recomp. Which I'm not be opposed to. 

But if I do decide to do a recomp, I'm gonna probably do Starting Strength or 5x5 or some other workout because I think hitting these bodyparts once a week won't result in muscle growth.

I have been lifting on and off for at least 10 years but was guilty of some that fuckarounditis.  I started experimenting with lg for at least 6 months but have been cutting for only about 2.  I have dropped around 15 pounds in that time but am not sure if I should keep cutting or do a recomp or something.  I have been doing rpt according to Andy's ripped.jp site working out 3 days a week about 45min each session.  I have been losing steadily about 1lb a week.  I do 2000 cal on wo days eating about 200gm of protein 50gm fat, 220gm carbs. I do 1500-1600 on off days eating 200gm protein, ~50gm fat, ~70gm carbs.  My eating window is from ~ 5:30pm- 11:00pm . one rep max for bench is ~250lbs, deadlift ~280, squat ~280, weighted chin ups 45lb+bodyweight x5 reps. I lifts have pretty much stalled or decreased by at least 10% since cutting.  I seem to hold most fat around lower abs and back.  I'm just not sure if I should keep cutting since I always have people telling me that I'm too skinny but I have that annoying lower back and lower ab fat still there so I get frustrated.  do you think for my height I should be weighing more? Like maybe I should bulk more so I have more muscle underneath and then when I cut, I would look more impressive. I have posted a couple back and front shoots to show where I'm currently at. sorry this was my first time posting links or anything like this.

I was significantly over weight at 5’8” 232lbs [picture](http://i44.tinypic.com/2qkmio9.jpg) [picture2](http://i42.tinypic.com/swxo44.jpg) [picture3](http://i41.tinypic.com/t8umid.jpg) , assuming about 30% body fat. I have worked in academic research and animal nutrition for 16 years, so when my future nutritionist brother-in-law explained to me the benefits of IF’ing (after watching him kill mass quantities of food); I had a “DUH” moment. I can eat the foods I like, be strong, lose weight, and be healthier at 3-4 workouts a week? What’s the down side?! 

*As an aside I think DIET is a four letter word and useless as it is synonymous with failure, as any diet is temporary at best.*

So my journey began! Having attempted many diets, I wanted to make this a lifestyle rather than a way to simply get lean. As such I began slowly with no cut in caloric intake. Instead I got accustomed to simply separating my fats and carbohydrates to workout and rest days and increase my protein consumption within my eating window. At this time I was still taking my hypertension medication as my medicated blood pressure was 147/88 on average. I had lifted in high school and in college so I had a good platform from which to start weight training again. My starting strength and body stats were as follows:


**Height 5’8”, Weight 232lbs, waist 36in
Bench Press: 200 x 10 x 3
Squat:          200 x 10 x 3
Dead lift:       285 x 6 x 3
Chin-ups:    0 x Body Weight (5 assisted)**


I lost 14lbs over the next 3 months down to 218lbs [picture1](http://i43.tinypic.com/2j0ikia.jpg) [picture2](http://i41.tinypic.com/2mmz7uc.jpg) [picture3](http://i40.tinypic.com/1h5ysj.jpg) on Jan. 1, 2012. I attribute a majority of this weight loss to simply weight lifting and being more active. I had difficulty with fasted training and had no endurance so I got in the habit of eating a small bowl of cereal 2 hours before lifting, just to be able to do reps. I am not sure if age is a factor for endurance but figured I should note it as my 22 year old brother-in-law had no problems with endurance when fasted.  As I did not modify my caloric intake I considered myself to be on a bulk for body re-composition. I was unemployed when I started Leangains and ran out of blood pressure medication, so had to go through the hassle of getting a new prescription. When I got my blood pressure checked I had been off my meds for 6 weeks and my blood pressure had dropped to 128/78 the lowest it has been in 7 years. This is still high but not enough to require medication so I have stopped needing my hypertension meds. In the past when I would go off my meds I would suffer headaches and my blood pressure would be 150/92. DO NOT GO OFF you meds without doctor approval. I have been monitoring my hypertension for ten years; the ability to stop taking meds was an unforeseen benefit of Leangains. After 3 months my strength and body stats changed to the following and I started tracking my progress on fitocracy.com my screen name is bbwhipple. 


**Height 5’8”, Weight 218lbs, waist 36in, and measurement at navel 42.75 inches
Bench Press: 255 x 3 x 3
Squat:          295 x 5 x 1 (to parallel) Changed to ATG mid February. 
Dead lift:       385 x 5 x 1
Chin-ups:      BW x 7, 6, 5**


Jan. 1, 2012 I started to modify my calories 1800/1600 Workout/rest day as I wanted to start a cut. I was accustomed to my eating window and found fasting to be not difficult at all depending on foods consumed. Slowly I was able to start training bench press fasted but none of the compound lifts, still needed a pre-workout carbohydrate boost to get reps on squat/dead lift days. My understanding of Leangains is that it really is geared for re-composition at 12% BF. As I was still 25+ BF on April 1, 2012, it is my belief that even with my caloric restriction my body still acted like I was in a bulk state. My lifts and endurance increased throughout the 90 day period to April 1, 2012 as my lifts jumped significantly. Furthermore I was finally able to perform compound lifts in a fasted state. My weight did not drop as much as I expected but I lost over four inches of fat off my midsection. My strength and body stats as of April 1, 2012 are as follows:
Height 5’8”, Weight 215lbs, waist 36in, and measurement at navel 38.5 inches


**Bench Press: 275 x 5 x 1 (300lb max)
Squat:          295 x 5 x 1 (ATG)
Dead lift:       425 x 5 x 3 (450lb max)
Chin-ups:    90lbs x1, 85lbs x1, 50lbs x4 (BW not a problem)

Based on my current result, my expectations are that I will continue to slowly loose weight and replace fat with muscle until I get closer to the 12% BF mark; at which point and time I will have to increase my calories as my body will not have the excess in storage as the BF gets consumed. Until then I believe I am still in a bulk even with a caloric deficit as I have stored energy for many years now ;)! Overall I am very satisfied with the results and will post my one year progress in Oct of this year!

1332439279.0,16,self.leangains,r8o0e,Bulking Results and Thoughts on x5 vs x10 reps,18,2,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/leangains/comments/r8o0e/bulking_results_and_thoughts_on_x5_vs_x10_reps/,"So I cut down to 6.1% body fat (measured by a DEXA scan) with leangains in Nov of 2010.  Spent about 8 months trying to lean bulk without any luck.  If I ate enough to get good recovery and progress, then I started packing on fat.  If I ate enough to stay lean, then I didn’t make any strength progress.  
  
Decided I was too lean to bulk and fatten back up to 10% (which involved a lot of alcohol and Nutella.  It was fun as hell, and definitely a mistake).  I also decided to accept some fat gain.  Then I started gaining strength like crazy for 3 months and then it plateaued.  Fat was still being added, but strength was just creeping up.  
  
Finally, in Feb of 2012 I got really tried of bulking and being fat.  My gym was having a 12 week transformation contest, so I decided to do that and start cutting.  I did another DEXA scan and found out that I put on 20.47lbs of fat and 0.38lbs of lean (0.1 was bone mass). I was a lot stronger, fatter, but not really any more muscular.  
  
I have lifted with different rep ranges, so I am going to use this [1 rep max calulator]( http://www.exrx.net/Calculators/OneRepMax.html) to try and compare results.  
  
BTW, I am 5'10.5"" and 46 years old.    

Nov 2010 164.1lbs, 9.93lbs fat,  145.82lbs lean, 8.4lbs bone - 6.1% body fat  
Deadlift: 275x4 (est 300x1)  
Squat: 240x6 (est 279x1)  
Bench: 225x6 (est 261x1)  
  
Feb 2012 185.0lbs, 30.4lbs fat, 146.1lbs lean, 8.5lbs bone – 16.5% body fat  
Deadlift: 325x5 (est 366x1)  
Squat: 295x5 (est 332x1)  
Bench: 255x5 (est 287x1)  
  
So the results are:  
Weight: +20.9lbs  
Fat: +20.47  
Lean: +0.28lbs  
Bone: +0.1lbs  
Body fat: +10.4%  
Deadlift: +66lbs (up 22%)  
Squat: +53lbs (up 19%)  
Bench: +26lbs (up 10%)  
  
Being stronger is nice.  I am way stronger and leaner than all my friends (even at 16.5% body fat).  However, I was really hoping for some size gains too.  I am tired of having 14” little girl arms that are strong.  I think I would rather have a bigger body that was less strong.  
  
If you are wondering how I can be stronger with such a tiny amount of lean mass gain it is because my central nervous system is stronger.  I pretty much have the same number of muscle cells/fibers as before, and I can just drive them harder.  
  
Lifting in the x5 rep range is supposed to improve strength.  Lifting in the x10 rep range is supposed to improve size.  I am going to cut back down to probably 8%-10% (which is going to suck because I am sure I am going to lose some muscle cutting).  I am also going to switch to lifting in the x10 range and hopefully gain some size.

Excerpts: 

&gt; Our main outcome was to look at the post-meal response for glucose and insulin. When I say post-meal, we gave people a high calorie, high glucose, high fat meal and then we wanted to see how well the body responded over that remaining period. It was a five hour period - what we've found is that compared to the uninterrupted sitting, so when they sat all day, when we introduced the activity breaks, the response in terms of glucose and insulin was 30 per cent lower over that five hour period compared to the uninterrupted sitting.

Also interesting...

&gt; If you're somebody that sits all day but does 45 minutes of exercise before you go to work or after you come back, is the sitting time an independent risk factor outside of other physical activity you might do during your non-work times?


&gt; Yes - it appears to be independent of leisure time physical activity.

[Here's](http://www.bakeridi.edu.au/NewsArticle.aspx?ID=275&amp;Article=1) the actual site of the people who did the study and their write up. I'm not sure how this all fits in with leangains (e.g. stay frequently active on rest days), but it's definitely interesting food for thought.

**TLDR**: Frequent light movement in the hours before eating reduces glucose and insulin response by 30%

**Goals:**

1. Recomp, meaning maintaining current weight (give or take about 5 lbs) while decreasing %BF (down to 22% or even 20%).
2. Lift more.
3. Given my weird school schedule, I want to waste as little time on food as possible so I can spend as much time as possible studying. This challenge is what prompted me to seriously consider IF.

**Tentative IF Schedule:** This is what I've come up with based on my school constraints and morning workouts. I would love some creative input.

     MONDAY through SATURDAY
      4:00 AM   Wake up
      5:30 AM   Lift or run
      8:00 AM   Finish workout
     10:00 AM   Break fast....(Refrigerator oatmeal)
     12:00 AM   Lunch.........(Hot leftovers)
      3:00 PM   Midday snack..(Protein bar or small snack)
      5:30 PM   Dinner........(Salad &amp; protein)
      6:00 PM   End feeding window
      8:30 PM   Sleep

    SUNDAY (Rest Day): Feed 10AM to 6PM

---

**Questions:**

* **Most important question:** Considering I do 3 days of lifting, 3 days of cardio, and only 1 rest day per week, what kind of calorie and macro split would you recommend for each type of day? I'm at a loss on this one...

* Due to schedule constraints, I would workout in the early morning and fast for an additional 3-4 hours before I could eat (feeding from about 10AM to 6PM). How detrimental is it to wait that long after a workout to eat? I don't plan on getting BCAA's because it's not economically feasible for me.

* Is not having BCAA's really that big of a deal? It sounds really gimmicky. If protein loss during post-workout fasting is really that big of a deal, what can I do to cheaply stave it off without breaking the fast?

* I'm concerned about hypoglycemia. I'm not diabetic or anything, but I do tend to get a woozy and moody when I haven't eaten in a while. Does this usually pass over time?

* (Hypothetically, if I could change my schedule) Is having your workout in the middle of the feeding window a good alternative? Or does that throw off the whole muscle recovery thing that Martin guy talked about [in this post](http://www.leangains.com/2010/05/early-morning-fasted-training.html).

* I heard that having low insulin levels when sleeping (e.g. not eating before bed) helps keep growth hormones high during sleep, which leads to better muscle recovery. Is that broscience? If not, how many hours before bed should one stop eating?

* Does the IF Calculator from the sidebar do all the math for me? Or is there other bro-algebra I need to know about?

* What else am I missing? Any problems stick out to you?

I'm starting at 15%BF so the first week will be a 1.5lb cut so my macros are -40/-5. The next five weeks will be 1.3lbs per week so my macros will be -40/0. The final 2 weeks will be 1lb per week so I'l go to -30/0.

I would also like to add though people might downvote for this. 31mintues knows what hes talking about but he doesn't know everything. The main thing that I disagreed with him on is his view of bulking. He said that you shouldn't have to add any volume to the RPT routine for a bulk. If your main goal is strength gain choose a powerlifting routine based upon your lifts. RPT just isn't as good as gaining pure strength as a true powerlifting routine. I don't claim t be an expert but I know that the big powerlifitng routines are there because they work and most likely work better then RPT when on a bulk. If your main goal isn't raw strength then by all means do RPT on a bulk, but your strength gains will most likely be slower then when on a powerlifting routine.

I am writing this post as a continuation of a post I made several months ago documenting my progress from fat to skinny fat to discovering Leangains/Intermittent fasting. My previous post can be found here  

**http://www.reddit.com/r/leangains/comments/11bav7/my_leangains_journey_from_broscience_to_science/**

In the post linked above, I stop at **fall 2012** and I will try to document my progress from then.


 * **Fall 2012 - Summer 2013 ( June 1st, 2013)**

During this period I kept to 16/8 fasting-feeding split because at this point I was used to the lifestyle **(intermittent fasting, as far as I am concerned, is a lifestyle change, not a diet plan)** and I loved it. I used this period to bulk up. I went from **175 lbs to 181 lbs** at the start of June 2013. Again there was no calorie counting during this bulk, even though I did the fasting. I kept an eye on my calories by monitoring my weight and strength ratio. If I was putting on weight but not getting stronger, I was eating too much.

* **Summer 2013 - Cut ( starting June 2013)** 

Doing the 16/8 split of fasting is now ingrained in me and is normal. I can go for hours past 16 hours fast and not feel hungry until I think about it. I started an **8 week cut** on June 1st. In addition to fasting I followed **Lyle McDonald's Ultimate Diet 2.0**. Now, I know what some of you are thinking with regards to Lyle McDonald Vs Martin Berkhan but I Just wanted to try it out and see what happened. It was a fun thing ( even though tough and some points) to try and I achieved the results I wanted. So here are the pics :

**[Before relaxed/flexed](http://imgur.com/a/POQdv)**  
**[After 8 Weeks relaxed and flexed at 172 lbs](http://imgur.com/a/VxWYZ)**

* **Conclusion**

I would  say that it was a successful cut and would definitely do it again. That being said, **The Ultimate Diet 2.0** is no doubt stressful and I would suggest reading the whole book first and trying an ultra low carb diet for a few days (this is a main component of the diet). **If anyone has any questions please feel free to ask and I will answer to the best of my knowledge. Thanks for reading!**

How the hell do you count the calories of fatty meat? On rest days, I'm supposed to eat fattier meat, but calorie counters like MyFitnessPal don't 'know' how much fat is actually on the cut of meat I have. I think these counters are way-overestimating the fattiness of the cuts I have.

Every time I go to punch in a piece of somewhat fatty steak for supper or whatever, the calorie number sounds way too high. Like, a normal-sized piece of steak with not too much visible fat, coming out to like, anywhere between 1000 and 1300 calories, depending on the size.

Heck, if I punch in a piece of what I consider to be lean beef, with hardly any visible fat on it, the calorie number is stupidly high. I've resorted to squeezing 90% of my food on rest days into one meal in the evening and just not counting calories. This meal is usually a 450g piece of ""fatty"" meat, some veggies cooked in coconut oil, and maybe a bit of fruit. My calories are clocking in at about 1500 for that one meal, but it just doesn't feel like 1500. I'm hungry again shortly after, and I wanna be like 'Arg! Fuck fatty meat. I'll just eat goddamn skinless chicken breast for every meal.'

Am I counting wrong, or doing something wrong? Am I the only one with this problem? Does everyone else just count macros and have a fat buffer or something? Like, it's so easy to count basically everything, except fatty meat.

As bulking is my main priority right now, do I wait till I reach &lt;15% BF or is it more convenient I bulk now?

For the first 3 weeks of IF, I went to sleep as usual around 10-11pm and had no trouble going to sleep (as usual)..

I didn't *want to* get up and start my day at 4am... But about 2 weeks into IF, I started to give in sometimes and actually got up and started my day at 4am (but only on those days where I could nap around noon).

It seems after the 4th week, sleeping... Or should I say, waking up is back to normal. I'm now on the 5th week.

Packed some serious lard over christmas so started cutting hard over the past few months.. anyway im back and I'm starting to think its time to switch to recomp... i'd say i am around 18% bodyfat atm so i guess i should continue cutting until i get to 15% but the problem is my ribs are actually starting to show quite badly.. what to do.. any advice?

80kg (176lbs) - down from 86kg
178cm (5'10)

height: 174cm (5' 8.5"")
weight: 71kg (156lbs)
age: 32

unfortunately I haven't taken a 'before' pic but I've lost some fat for sure, and I look better.
I choose a -30/-10 cut plan because I was overweight, with around 20% bodyfat.

I'm following this workout, traning at home (from the FAQ - http://i.imgur.com/8I82m.png):

Monday:
Deadlift 2x5  *(158lbs/72kg)*
Overhead Press 3x8 *(41lbs/19kg per dumbell)*
Rows 3x8 *(80lbs/36kg per dumbell)*

Wednesday:
Bench Press 3x8 *(114lbs/52kg)*
Weighted Chinups 3x8
Close Grip Floor Press 3x8 *(38lbs/17kg per dumbell)*

Friday:
Squats 3x6 *(150lbs/68kg)*
RDL 3x8 *(114lbs/52kg)*
Calf Raise 2x8 *(58lbs/26kg per dumbell)*

I workout fasted in the morning and I don't take BCAA.
I raise the weights by around +10% every session.

Macros are like these and feed window is 2pm-&gt;10pm (1384 cals on rest days / 1779 cals on worout days):
http://i.imgur.com/RxrIz9E.png

My main question is, what should I fix to get a better looking body for the summer, e.g. visible ABS? Let's say in 3 months time.
Maybe switch to a -20/+20 recomp or is it too early? Because I'm still at probably 16-18% body fat. Or just continue with -30/-10?!

Also, after 8 weeks on the same workout, I feel like I can insert some more exercises; 1 more set + 1 complete ABS workout of 10-15 mins (P90X ABS workout maybe?).

Any advice to optimize and improve my workout/diet is highly appreciated.

Thank you!

1365565345.0,16,self.leangains,1c1h29,"After Deadlift, dangerous blood pressure drop...DAE experience this ever?",18,2,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/leangains/comments/1c1h29/after_deadlift_dangerous_blood_pressure_dropdae/,"I'm on the RPT 3-Day split, and yesterday I did DL and chin-ups.  I worked out hard and was exhausted at the end.  Sometimes over the years I have worked out legs hard and felt a little nausea at the end.  Not so in this case: I felt perfectly fine during and immediately after.

It started when I was 1/4 of the way home in the car -- slight nausea, dizziness, and weakness.  I thought that was weird, but it has always passed, so I assumed it would this time.  It got progressively worse as I got closer to home, and I actually had to pull over about 200 yards from being home and lay on the curb grass and call my other half to come get me with sodas and stuff (had no idea what the problem was, but thought this would help).  By this point, also had tingling in both my arms -- it was just like the kind you get when you feel the circulation isn't going so good because your lying in a weird position, only I wasn't.

I started feeling a bit better by the time my girlfriend showed up to get me (which my doc explained was because I was now lying instead of sitting), but she wisely insisted I go to the doc immediately.  By time I got there an hour later, I felt much better than I had (though not even close to normal yet), and my otherwise-normal pressure of 120/80 was 100/60 (no idea what it was while I was lying on the side of the road).  Per my doc, I'm on increased salt and fluid intake for now, but it is still taking time to rebound from this; 36 hours later, I still am feeling a bit messed up.

Extra info: I am type 1 diabetic, so at first I thought maybe my blood sugar was my problem, but after repeatedly checking my blood glucose levels, they were perfectly normal all throughout this episode.  It was warm here yesterday, but not *that* warm.  Also, I drank a fair amount of water at the gym.  I have been on a -30/-10 cut since the end of January with zero problems whatsoever.

Anyway, I was hoping to be able to bench tomorrow, but I think I should forget it as I cant even walk around a lot without feeling slightly dizzy and weak.  Has anyone else been in a similar situation?  I feel like bragging that ""this is how good my deadlift workout is,"" but I'm guessing there likely is some sort of dehydration/electrolyte imbalance going on here to cause all this.

I'm sure you all will laugh that I kept reassuring myself that everything was okay because, no matter what were to happen, I had gotten my workout in for Monday to full completion before any of this started, and nothing could take that away from me.

Just curious if anyone has experienced something similar to this, and if so, what did you do about it?  Did it affect your workouts or diet?  Was it intermittent or a chronic thing to watch for?  I'm probably just overreacting, but I just don't want to under-react and pretend like nothing's wrong either.

**TL; DR:** Unsafe drop in blood pressure after DL made me sick, and I'm still messed up days later.  Anyone else ever get this?

**EDIT, 11-Apr-2013, 00:45 EDT**: My deepest thanks to all who replied.  Sixty hours after this happened, I've been cramming water, salt, and other fluids the best I can.  Also, I've let my diet relax, trying just to eat around maintenance and hit protein the best I can without going crazy.  I've gained 6 lbs. since this started, btw, probably thanks to all the salt and my body being in some sort of *crisis-mode*.

I still feel weak and can't do very much, and I get occasional feelings of dizziness and wooziness if I am standing up too long or moving around too much (though it is *nothing* compared to how bad Day 1 was).  In light of that, there is no way I am working out until I see my doc again on Tuesday; so we'll see what he thinks at that point.  Meanwhile, I am trying to get in to see my endocrinologist as soon as I can also. 

I'll be sure to update this thread upon any developments.  I hope it will at least be able to help someone else who may ever find him- or herself in a similar situation.

I tried every diet tracking website in the /r/fitness FAQ (took the time to register for each site -_- ) and to be honest they are all lacking essentials features:

1) Being able to choose, at the beginning of each day, between Workout Day and Rest Day since macros are completely different

2) Fully customize macronutrients. MyFitnessPal allows you to do so but only with 5% accuracy and it's a pain in the ass to do it.

1360577983.0,14,self.leangains,18aw6b,IF / LeanGains - How to start as very weak skinny-fat (??) guy?,16,2,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/leangains/comments/18aw6b/if_leangains_how_to_start_as_very_weak_skinnyfat/,"Hello together!

So after more or less unsuccessful attempts to significantly improve my body shape I would like to get some advice here. I stumbled upon the topics of intermittent fasting and leangains and hopefully can find something that works now.

**My data**
Age: 32
Height: 174 cm
Weight: 70.9 kg
[Photo](http://i.imgur.com/PZOSF7w.jpg)

I consider myself as somehow skinny-fat. If I hardly pull in my belly it looks like in the picture above. Normally my belly clearly stands out and no ripped structures are visible at all. So to be honest the photo above is a rather complimenting one, my belly is very fatty if not pulled back. Perhaps I will make a photo of that.

**My history**
Many years of fuckarounditis in the beginning without a clear concept and no complex barbell exercises, but just crappy machine training. 2 years ago I finally started with barbell training and the big exercises for the first time. I started from zero on (deadlifts with bar only and so on). Unfortunately I rushed the weights up and completely ignored correct exercise form. This lead to doing 100 kg ""highspeed""-deadlift sets with horrible form end of 2011 and pain in the lower back on a regular basis.

I then came across the book ""Beyond Brawn"" from McRobert and realized that I was basically doing EVERYTHING wrong: Too low squats with rounding back, much too fast movement during every exercise, bench press with lower arms not perpendicular to the ground ending in a wrong position on the chest and so on...lots of errors. I then decided to start all over again and dropped all the weights to slowly learn correct exercise technique and speed. That was approximately one year ago.

**Current status**
After this complete ""reset"" mentioned above I continued to VERY slowly increase weights keeping good exercise technique.

The workout schedule is as follows: Monday: Squat, Dips, One-arm dumbbell row - Thursday: Deadlift, Standing Military Press - Friday: Chin-ups, Bench Press

Unfortunately I still struggle to see good progress. To give an example I will post some comparison values for my working sets:

August 2012: Deadlift: 3 x 8 with 61.5 kg - Squat: 3 x 8 with 45.0 kg - Bench Press: 3 x 8 with 50.0 kg

Today: Deadlift: 3 x 8 with 65.5 kg - Squat: 3 x 8 with 48.0 kg - Bench Press: 3 x 8 with 52.5 kg

So when checking these weight values for example on strstd.com or when reading on leangains.com I get the impression that these values are still ridiculously low. So there seems to be no ""newbie bonus"" anymore or something like that. I just don't get the weights up. Progress is rather tiny and it will take ages to even reach the intermediate level - this is my impression at least.

So what are your recommendations for me? Should I better go for a Big 3 session 3 days a week as recommended on rippedbody.jp to increase the much too low weights? I think this would be too hard, since although the weights are low this is pushing me to the maximum of my capabilities. I am completely exhausted after the deadlifts for example regardless to the low weight.

Should I stay with the split routine according to Beyond Brawn with tiny progress?

That said, if I’m asking something that’s been answered in the FAQ, by all means tell me to fuck off and read it again.

**Info:** Male, 23, 6’4”, 234 lbs., high BF%, just beginning SS

**Diet:** Leangains and IF, -10%/-30% (3000/2300 calories/day), 1g protein/lb.

40% protein/45% fat/15% carbs on rest days
		
30% protein/20% fat/50% carbs on workout days.

**Goals:** Primarily weight loss. Strength gain would be nice, but I understand that there’s only so much you can do in that department while at a caloric deficit. As my name implies, I’d like to be at least sub-200 lbs. I was hoping to achieve this before my cousin’s wedding in late August, which seems like a reasonable goal to me. Slightly more difficult would be to hit the 200 mark by the time I graduate in mid-May. I’m new to this, so I have no idea if that would be possible or not.

**Questions:**

-I’m working out in the morning, with a full day of classes immediately following, so I eat an earlyish lunch immediately after working out, but then don’t eat again until I’m home for dinner. Since I don't have the time or access to a kitchen during the day, it's much more convenient to have a smaller lunch and larger dinner. So how bad is it to have the second meal be the larger of the two? Not ideal but acceptable, or is it absolutely necessary to make my post-workout meal the biggest?

-On carbs, probably my biggest weakness is pasta, I adore the stuff. I know that Leangains recommends carbs like brown rice and sweet potatoes, so where does pasta fall on the acceptable list? Is whole grain pasta a good enough compromise?

-I'm getting a lot of confusing/conflicting information on macros, with some sources I need 2.5g/lb of protein, but many people here are talking about they just get 1 g/lb. Given that my focus is weight loss, is that much protein necessary? 585g (2.5x234) of protein seems like a totally impossible amount to eat.",,False,,t5_2saqe,False,,,True,t3_16snj1,http://www.reddit.com/r/leangains/comments/16snj1/just_beginning_leangains_have_a_few_questions_i/,

[A super-simple chicken&amp;vegetable fry-up with cheese](http://i.imgur.com/ERzbV.jpg)

*Ingredients:*

* 270g chicken breast, seasoned with [Masala](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/58/Garammasalaphoto.jpg)
* Half a bag frozen vegetables for the pan (375g). Called ""Pfannengemüse"" here in Germany and available at [Aldi](http://www.aldi-sued.de/de/html/product_range/2744_19179.htm).
Extremely low-cal, one complete bag sums up to about 420cal. It's already seasoned and also contains some kind of sauce. Awesome stuff.
* 10ml sesame oil
* 50g Emmental cheese

*Preparation:* Fry the diced and seasoned chicken in the hot sesame oil until brown. Add the frozen vegetables and cook them with the chicken for some minutes. Finally, throw in the cheese and wait until it's melted.

*Macros:* 764cal, 20g carbs, 38g fat, 86g protein

Those can still be adapted to your own needs by either using low-fat cheese, leaving it out completely (for a cut) or by just using more of it (for a bulk). Do whatever fits your macros best!

* 70 kg Squat @ 10 Reps, 3 sets.
* 50 kg Dead @ 10 Reps, 3 sets.

I just recently started doing squat and dead, hence the low weight. I do a lot of other exercises that cover most of my body.

How should I tackle the whole LeanGains thing? Would a -20/+20 be a good idea as I still want to cut for a while? Is it really true that I need around 160g of PURE protein EVERY day??

I also plan to switch the Greyskull LP while on the bulk, and I was wondering, for those on a linear progression program while using a -10/+30 bulk, do you modify the weight progression at all from the standard program?

However elsewhere I see a suggested rep range for bench expressed as 6-8 and where the weight for a set is progressed when the max. of 8 is hit.

How does one establish their rep ranges short of consulting with Martin or Andy? Why might one choose the wider, higher ranges of 5-8, 8-10, 10-12 vs a straight up 6-8 for instance?",,False,,t5_2saqe,False,,,True,t3_10hz44,http://www.reddit.com/r/leangains/comments/10hz44/rpt_rep_ranges/,

1344872757.0,14,self.leangains,y5cz7,I did a little experiment this weekend with my cut...great success?,21,7,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/leangains/comments/y5cz7/i_did_a_little_experiment_this_weekend_with_my/,"Good morning everyone.

Just wanted to share something I tried this weekend and get your thoughts on it.

I'm on a +7/-25 cut/recomp (yes I realize +7 is a weird number but for my TDEE it comes to approx. 2500 calories and I like that. And the -25 is what it's come to after some experimenting - it feels the most comfortable for a fairly large deficit).

So on to my experiment - I had a big workout on Friday at about 3pm after a 17hour fast. Managed to get 6x275lbs on my deadlift, 7x210lb on my bench which felt great. Then I had a glorious PWO feast. I wanted it to be a cheat meal/day so I didn't count calories but tried to eat as much as I wanted, making sure to get a good amount of carbs - prob around 400g (my training day carb goal is usually 300g on a non-cheat day). I definitely went over my maintenance by 7%. Was probably closer to 25-30%. **This was part 1 of my experiment - a big carb refeed to spike leptin levels.**

On to part 2: Next day, Saturday, I did a 23-hour fast. From 11pm Friday night to 10pm Saturday night. With a lot of LISS in the day. Walking, stretching etc.,. And then I had one large meal Saturday night - about 1200-1400 cals, mostly protein and fat. My rationale for this is as follows: **I theorized that with my increased leptin levels due to my refeed, it would be a good time to do an extended fast with a lot of LISS to burn off a lot of fat**

So I don't know if it's because I wanted this to succeed, or if it's because I'm coming off a fairly good week diet-wise but **I looked noticeably leaner on Sunday.**  I mean my lower abs were more defined,  love handles looked noticeable smaller, and my upper abs gained a lot of definition. I'm at about 11-12% bf right now so this is where I see the most of my improvements. I did my usual 16-hour fast on Sunday but didn't eat particularly well - had a couple of beers in the evening. Still as lean this morning.

So that was my experiment. I had the idea after doing some reading on Martin's blog and after I read the AMA by the div 1 soccer player a few weeks ago. I thought I'd post and get your thoughts on this - if any of you have tried anything like this or if any of you are willing to try and see what your experience is - that would be awesome.

Have a great day everyone. I have a squat workout coming up at 3pm. CANNOT WAIT.",,False,,t5_2saqe,1344880095.0,,,True,t3_y5cz7,http://www.reddit.com/r/leangains/comments/y5cz7/i_did_a_little_experiment_this_weekend_with_my/,

Have been doing SS for the last 4 months and have made great strength gains starting from 0 coming back from an old injury.  GOAL is to get bodyfat down to 15-17%.
  
DIET:
-30/-10 (2060/2649 calories)
25/75 and 50/50 for carbs/fat split for rest and workout days
1.5g of protein per LBW (2.5g/BW seems like a shitload)

WORKOUT:
Reverse pyramid as instructed on workout
Rest days will involve a long walk in the morning yoga at lunch (have flexibility issues from injuries so I need to keep moving every day)

WHERE I'M AT:
Front squat: 160 (switching to backsquat next week after some technique research)
Bench: 180 (5)
Deadlift: 235 (5)
Press 115 (5)

QUESTIONS:

1. What can I do to improve the above plan?  Martin suggests 2.5g of protein per lb of bodyweight.  That's a shitload of protein at 500g plus and doesn't seem doable.  Seems excessive.

2. What's the best protein/carb/fat approach for a big guy?  I used 25/75 and 50/50 per the FAQ for rest and workout splits.  Does it make sense to do 25/75 and 75/25 for carb cycling?  What makes the most sense for someone with a higher bf%?

3. Should I bring my calories down (used the calculator for totals)?

4. For those who had to drop a higher percentage of fat, any tweaks you used to make progress? Any other advice anyone can offer? 

Thanks for your help.  Love SS and the strength I've been able to add.  I do not want to do a 6 meal a day, low calorie diet and lose my gains.

I absolutely want to get stronger and lower BF%, but I have a ways to go, and I'm confused if I'm even doing this right. Just for reference I'm 22, F, 5'6, 170 lbs, and somewhere around 28% BF. So yeah, I clearly have little to no experience with lifting. 

I recently joined a gym that I love, and started off taking all the spin/aerobics classes they had to offer. Then, they set me up with a trainer, who explained that I'm going to burn more body fat lifting weights than riding a bike going no where for hours. So, she gave me a basic weight training routine, and I've been following it two days a week, but have still been pretty heavy on the cardio the other 3 days I work out. 

So, after reading the information given in the sidebar, I've decided to give this a try. I took a strength class this morning which leads me to questions 1.

1. The strength class was lifting free weights/body bars (anywhere from 7-12 lbs) and doing hammer curls, overhead presses, squats, etc. Is this an okay place to start out? I'm still intimidated by the bench press, especially if I don't have anyone to spot me/ let me know if I'm even doing it right. 

2. The calculator said I need to eat something like 2200 calories since its my ""training day"". I'm really not sure I can eat that much, even over the course of 8 hours, just due to my schedule. I'm assuming it's really important I atleast try? The other caveat to this is I'm gluten-sensitive, so just grabbing something quick and high-ish calorie is a little harder ( like pizza or a sandwich or something) 

3. About the early morning fasted training schedule- I know he recommends using BCAA to supplement. Unfortunately, I am a broke college student, and sort of live paycheck to paycheck. I won't be able to buy any new supplements for a couple weeks, so will whey protein work in the interim? 

4. And finally, so I should really stop doing cardio?


I do apologize if this all sounds stupid. I really would like to do this correctly, I just need a little guidance :) 

Thanks!

I was stuck in a weight-plateau of 166-170lb range for the entire 3rd month.  Granted, I was somewhat eating more than usual, but anyway, I started researching ways to break through a plateau and thats when I discovered leangains.

I decided to give LG a try to lose more weight and kept eating at a deficit. (aka cutting.)

* In the first week I incorporated 16/8 and started getting used to that.  This is my favorite part of the whole program.

* In the second week I added on the concept of calorie cycling (i.e. 1500 on rest days, 2000 on wo days).  This was my second favorite part of the whole program (MORE FOOD ON W/O DAYS? YES PLEASE.)


* In the third week I tried making protein *the* number one priority everyday.  This was really hard to get used to, and it's still difficult to get all that protein in *everyday* but I make a conscious effort anyway to at least eat a shitload of protein before I worry about anything else.

Since that week and up until now (i think i'm on week 5?), I've tried to micromanage the carbs and fat as well but I haven't been able to hit the ratios perfectly at all. I almost always overdo the carbs on rest-days even though it's supposed to be lower-carb.

But honestly, I feel *great.*  I'm still losing weight and gaining muscle.  I love this lifestyle.  And this program is overall a great success.  It's quite amazing, really.

Previous progress pic @ 3 months: http://www.reddit.com/r/leangains/comments/18st94/3_month_progress_on_leangains/

Started leangains on a -40/20 cut for 2 months, then -30/10 cut for 1 month, now currently on a -30/0 cut for the past 3 months. I haven't been super meticulous with my macros, but I do eat low carb/ high fat on rest days and the opposite on workout days. I rarely meet my protein requirements since I have a hard time getting enough without shakes and plus I've been really enjoying the food I've been eating. For the most part everything is eyeballed and overestimated and since I've been continuing to see good results, I've left it that way. For the intermittent fasting I will do a 18/6 split on rest days and 20/4 on workout days due to extra time spent working out and cooking. I have also thrown in 40 hour fasts every month or so just to cleanse myself or if I feel if I had done too much damage that weekend with overeating and alcohol. I might throw in a few more 40 hour fasts before the end of June due Mexico trip/Bachelor party.

For the workouts, I originally was on RPT then switched over to 5/3/1 after 2-3 months due to boredom. Each workout consists of my core workout, then 4-5 accessory workouts except when I deload at the end of the cycle. I've gone against most people's advice just because I enjoy lifting and feel like I am not accomplishing anything with a 30-40 minute workout.

I am not a strict leangainer, but I follow most of the basic principles and I would like to thank everyone who's contributed here for all the good advice.

By the way, could anyone guesstimate as to what my BF% is at this time?

I'm 24 years old, six foot flat, and weigh 170lbs. That's down two pounds from when I started, but mostly my weight has seemed to stay the same. 

I've been going to the gym for about a year now, and although I've always ostensibly had a program to follow, I haven't tracked my numbers very well until now. Six weeks ago I started Phrakture's Greyskull LP variant, and noticed - when I had numbers to compare - that I was considerably weaker than most people who post in /r/leangains and /r/fitness. This kinda makes me sad, but I'm just gonna keep doing my best

Squat - started at 110lbs, it's now at 155

Deadlift - started at 110lbs, it's now at 190

Bench (DB) - started at 88lbs, it's now at 132

Press - started at 67lbs, it's now at 115


The IF calc gave me a TDEE of 2168, so I was at 1730 for rest days and 2600 on workout with a 25/75-75/25 carb/fat split. I was very meticulous tracking calories and macronutrients on MFP, and I'd always be very close to them. 

Here's a comparison picture, not great quality: [left is week one, right is the final day of week six](http://i.imgur.com/RkKkp5q.jpg)

I guess again I probably shouldn't be comparing myself to other people so much, but it's a bit disheartening to see relatively little discernable difference, even if it is a relatively short time. I guess that's the nature of the recomp beast

It often seems like my body composition is so damn hard to change compared to friends and other lifters - I find it very difficult to gain or lose weight, and I'm not sure why. That coupled with my low numbers has made this a pretty humbling experience, but I'm just gonna keep on trucking and see how far I can go

As far as future goals, I think I'd quite like to bulk (+0.5lbs per week), but I'm unsure if this is wise. I know it's generally best to be as lean as possible before starting a bulk but I'm actually pretty happy with my BF% and there's not a huge amount of mass to cut down to.

I have a few questions regarding my schedule however. Due to work, the only time I can see being able to consistently workout is around 6-8pm. 

For workout days, should it be okay to eat 2 meals prior to workout? I've seen mention of it briefly in Martin's guide but haven't come across any posts of people actually doing that. I was thinking breaking the fast at about 12:30pm, eating 15% calories, then 15% again at 3pm, workout between 6-8, then the final 70% of calories at 8:30. 

How do you usually structure means on rest days? From what I've read it doesn't seem to matter as long as you get the calories in within the window and it works for you. For this I would break at the same time, eat 35% calories, then 2 more meals every 3 hours or so. Is there any special balance of macros on the rest day? I've read at least .4g protein/lb of bodyweight in the first meal. 

I'm in the process of planning out the actual meals and was hoping for a little direction or input as to what works for you. Thanks!",,False,,t5_2saqe,False,,,True,t3_18ra2v,http://www.reddit.com/r/leangains/comments/18ra2v/starting_leangains/,

I don't have access to power rack or anything of that sort for squatting in my Gym, so that only alternative is smith machine. It was fine initially, but since last 2 workouts I have been having some pain in the knees after workout, and I feel it specially during squatting (I am squatting around 100lbs currently). I sometimes feel that my leg is in a weird position while squatting with a smith machine, but much normal if I squat free. I follow stronglifts5*5 program and it is strictly against the smith machine.

Now the questions is that can smith machine really cause serious problems and are they not effective at all? I am going to search for another gym with power rack but just in case the knee pain doesn't go away, what should I do next?

edit: I squeeze my shoulder trying to feel a finger in between the bones, I take my butts out and move my pelvis forward to keep my back as straight as possible. Maybe I am overdoing something, standing too in or out, or too wide. But when I do squats with empty barbell initially my knees definitely seem to be moving in a weird manner, it feels ok after the warmup but I guess it only feels normal, while actually hurting my knees.

The difference is that I also plan to take a consistent (location / lighting) non-flexed photo and have a DEXA scan to monitor my body comp each week. I'll post the results on here as I go along, starting today with week as it is the end of week one.


I'm 33, and started off at 86.8kgs (191lbs) at 20% body fat. I've never been ripped, but I'm usually about 16%. I have always been active and tried my hand at loads of different activities / sport. In the last few years it has mostly been weights and bit of crossfit. I ran a marathon in 2011 and my son was born a couple of months later. He is one now and I in the last year I have not been training consistently at all. I got a bit of a shock when I saw the 20% result from the DEXA - I was expecting 18% at worst. I had a guess at my 5RMs for Starting Strength and was pretty spot on with them all:


Squat - 90kg / 198lbs

Bench - 65kgs / 143lbs (always been my weakest)

Press - 40kgs / 88lbs (was a bit easy)

Deadlift - 140kgs / 308lbs 

Pull ups - 5 strict / 12 kipping

So - [here are the first weeks results](http://imgur.com/a/I2r9S). It's not going to blow you away, but I am happy with it!!

I began with a cut, like most people have, I did 3 days in the gym a week, RPT style, it went great, i got down to a ridicolusly low bf, that i was happy with.


So September hit and I was ready for a bulk. I wasn't ready to give up IF or the whole carb cycling leangains style either, I liked it alot. So I decided I would do a bulk, 3 days a week working out, and do [Lyle McDonald's Bulking Routine](http://jcdfitness.com/wp-content/download/Lyle_McDonald_Generic_Bulking_Routine_FAQ.pdf) . I did change up the routine a little bit, which I will list below. 


Anywho I did about 2 weeks of a deload before, then began with the program, seeing decent strength gains in most lifts except for my squat. I continued doing the program, not wanting to give up. After about 6 weeks of upping weights my squat only went from 225x8 to 235x8. I was not too pleased strength wise, although I was bulking up pretty decent. And I know its Lyle's Generic ""BULK"" routine not strength so that's why I was kinda ok with that. But anyways so I decided I was gonna deload now and do another 6-8 week run at it before switching to a cut in about april. 


I just finished my deload and this is my 2nd week upping the weights... my squat is fucken terrible! after the deload I couldn't even get 225x6, the weight just felt sooooooo heavy! i fucken had squat day today, I went down into the hole with 225, and I barely made it out on my first rep! I Almost lost it on myself :p like wtf is going on, I feel like my squats are getting worse and worse, so I have come to my fellow leangainers to look for some help! I feel like my form is getting worse also, so im tempted to lower the weights to practise form again, but I don't wanna lose possible size progress in my legs from dropping the weight.


My first run through of the program I did as follows:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Day 1 (Upper body)

Bench - 3 x 6-8
Row - 3 x 6-8
ohp - 3 x 6-8
chins - 2 x 10-12
tri ext - 2 x 10-12
ez bar curls - 2 x 10-12

Day 2 (Lower Body)

squat - 3 x 6-8
GHR - 3 x 6-8
leg ext - 2 x 10-12
leg curl - 2 x 10-12
calf Raise - 2 x 10-12

Day 3 (Upper body)

Incline Bench - 3 x 6-8
chins - 3 x 6-8
ohp - 3 x 6-8
Row - 2 x 10-12
dips - 2 x 10-12
ez bar curls - 2 x 10-12

Day 4 (Lower Body)

Deadlift - 3 x 6-8
Front Squat - 3 x 6-8
leg curl - 2 x 10-12
leg ext - 2 x 10-12
calf Raise - 2 x 10-12


I did this program in a 3 day a week fashion 
(Upper, Lower, Upper)
(Lower, Upper, Lower)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

During my second deload I did some more researching and decided I am gonna try 4 days a week this time with the some exercises, just added in one more upper back movement on my upper day. 


I am currently eating 3225 cals, 200p, 515c, 40f on T days and 2200 cals, 200p, 110c, 105f on Rest Days. That was bringing my scale up at a slow rate but a constant rate, which I was happy with. I'm currently eating a bit over those cals now as to compensate for my weight gain so far.


Anyways i gave you guys as much info as I could think of if theres anything else u need please ask!

 Ps. my deadlift also hasn't made huge gains either, I went from 315x8 to about 335x8 now, although my 2nd and 3rd sets of deadlifts have shot up alot, I went from 315 on my first set, 280 on second and 250 on third, to about 335, 315, 290 now.

I keep lowering my macros but now I am starting to see a lot of the symptoms listed in this article (gas and bloating, low body temp, low energy), as well as a stall in strength progression. I did the body temperature test and consistently come in low. I am starting to wonder if I haven't been eating too few calories for way to long at this point (been into ""fitness"" for over 6 years now and lost 70#). So on a gut level, this protocol seems to make sense for me.

I haven't ever done a true ""bulk"" because I've heard you want to get to your desired body fat level first, but I've been stuck at 12-14% for almost a year now. So I'm wondering if doing a 2-3 month bulk, following this protocol, would be what my body needs to be willing to ""give up"" the last few pounds of fat once I switch back to LeanGains in May.

I've heard from a ton of people prior to doing some actual looking around that 1g per pound of body weight for protein is exactly what you should be aiming for. But then I was told that I should be going for 3g per kg of body weight, which was also stated in the FAQ on the side.

I did a bit more digging around on this subreddit and saw a bunch of people saying that the 3g/kg proportion is way too much and should be aiming for ~1.8/kg instead.

 In it, he's pretty adamant about those on a cut concentrating on lifting heavy for low reps. He also states that deadlifts should never be done  on the same day as squats, and in fact should be done only once a week. He basically spells out a very minimalist 3xweek schedule where you do (quoting from the article):

&gt;Monday: Deadlifts and weighted chins. Make sure you get 5 mins of rest in between deadlifts and chins.
&gt;
&gt;Wednesday: Bench
&gt;
&gt;Friday: Squats. Make sure you get a minimum of two days of rest in between deadlifts and squats, i.e. don’t do heavy deads on Wednesday and then heavy squats on Friday.

My question is, I'm doing Starting Strength and do squats pretty much every workout. I also sometimes do deadlifts twice a week. Is this not optimal? Should I mod my workouts to be more like Martin's suggestion or should I stick it out with Starting Strength?

I'm on my first week of LG and am fairly excited about it.  I've been lurking this board for the last couple weeks and have used the search function a bunch of times to get my questions answered, but one topic I don't see discussed much is whether people feel like they've gotten a good workout on LG.

I should mention that I'm not a *complete* beginner to exercise, since I've been doing P90X off and on since February and have taken cardio classes at the gym frequently over the last couple months.  And after a session of P90X or 2-3 gym classes in a row, I definitely *feel* fatigued (in a good way).

However, today was my third day of working out on LG (benches and weighted dips), and even though I am trying to do the max-rep x 5 thing with RPT, I just don't *feel* like I've exerted myself enough to justify the extra calories.  I'm new to The Big 3, so I've spent the first half of each workout probing for my max, and then I'm doing, for example, max squat x 5, max squat -10% x 6, max squat -20% x 7.

My second workout day (dead lifts and weighted chins) was a bit different, though.  Since I was worried that I wasn't feeling fatigued (even though I followed RPT as best I could at the gym), I sporadically did sets of 5-10 WCs at home throughout the rest of the day (since there is a chin-up bar literally between my room and the main bathroom).  Having done maybe 6-7 'extra' sets of 5-10 WCs each, I could definitely feel a quality soreness in my upper back and arms the next day.  So, what I'm wondering is, and maybe this is stupid, but is doing this in any way bad or disruptive to the LG methodology?  I haven't seen anyone else discussing this kind of 'extracurricular' strength training, which made me wonder.

However, I recently went with the two meal pre-workout approach so that I could workout with my cousin at night, around 7pm. The next morning I seemed to be noticeably leaner in the mirror and thought nothing of it. I did the two pre-workout meal approach again and again noticed how much leaner I had gotten. When I went back to the fasted workout plan, I didn't seem as lean as I did the morning before. I got curious and looked into when it was best to eat your largest meal with fat loss in mind and found that Martin actually covered the topic. Apparently, eating large amount of carbs for your last meal is best for fat loss and eating them after your workout is best for muscle gains.

Overall I surprised myself with how much progress I have made - I was not expecting such a dramatic bf% drop coupled with lean mass gain. In essence, LG really does what's advertised.

My methods are mostly LG, with some differences, and accidentally similar to silverhydra cheatmode. I restrict carbs on rest days more than Martin suggests (&lt;50g where possible), I limit eating window to **less than** 8 hours and eat only 1 meal a day very often. I also strictly work out fasted and do massive carb backloading (75% or more of total kcal, +over 250g carb) 45-1h after workouts which I think has made a massive difference hormonally.

My goal is to hit 8% bf and maintain it comfortably within the next 6 months.

Calisthenics and Gymnastics Mixed Methods",18,4,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/leangains/comments/xrhfk/lg_bodyweight_only_training_guide_calisthenics/,"If you have a body, you are an athlete. Period.

As an athlete, OR, if you want to at least LOOK like an athlete, you must TRAIN like an athlete.

This means blending various traits together, traits that develop the following:

    *strength

    *speed / power

    *muscle building / functional hypertrophy

    *conditioning

    *fat loss

As you will see in your workouts, your training will cover all of the above along with a

day where you mix all the aspects together and focus on having FUN, NO rules

and simply being a “Soul Lifter” - training according to what you feel as natural, like a dancer is to freestyle.

Your workouts will be organized into 4

workouts:

    *Hybrid / Freestyle / ""Soul Lifting""

    *Strength &amp; Speed

    *Muscle Building / Functional Hypertrophy

    *Conditioning / Fat Loss

On your “off / rest” days you can and should stay active through outside activities.

These activities can be your choice and will vary depending on time of year. For me they vary between playing basketball, mountain biking, swimming, running, and etc. The key is to remain active and open your body up to a wide spectrum of fun activities. 

(**Note: It would be wise to find time to stretch/and or do yoga. Reasons will be explained at the end.**)

************************************************************************************

Now, let me break down some of the methods we will use during

workouts, see below:

**1.Ladders - Perform the prescribed ladder reps while resting 30-60 seconds between each rep. As the reps climb, each “step” of the ladder gets tougher. These are incredible for developing strength, building muscle and perfecting technique. An example of ladders on pull ups would be like so: 5 x 1, 2, 3. This means you would perform 1 rep, rest 30 seconds, 2 reps and rest 30 sec., and finally 3 reps followed by a longer rest period. This would be ONE ladder, and 4 more ladders would be left.**

************************************************************************************

**2.SubMax Effort (SM) - this means to NOT destroy yourself when performing the set, instead, leave about 1 or 2 reps left out (about 85% of your best reps).**

************************************************************************************

**3.Max Effort (ME) - This means you go ALL out and crush the last set, making sure you have nothing left in ya.**

************************************************************************************

**4.Dynamic Effort (DE) - Perform each rep with maximum speed, BUT.... NEVER sacrificing the technique for speed. Remember, Form is King and Technique is Queen.**

************************************************************************************

**5.Grease The Groove (GTG) - With GTG you perform the exercise several times through the day for up to 2 weeks at a time (Or the prescribed length of time). Every set is performed with perfect technique/form and is NEVER taken to fatigue. GTG is excellent for improving strength and skill in body-weight movements that are challenging you.**

************************************************************************************

**6.Supersets / Circuits : Anytime you see A, B, etc. this means perform the exercises back to back, no rest between each exercise. When you finish the last exercise in the sequence, then you can rest. Example = Set 1A) Set 1B)**
************************************************************************************
When performing weighted body-weight exercises, you can add weight to the
exercises in multiple ways: - Weight Belt - Weighted Vest - Weighted Back Pack - Chains

You can purchase weight vests or weighted belt with chains for strapping weights onto at your local fitness stores. These stores often have much cheaper prices than online stores and of course you skip the shipping charges as well.

I’ve even seen my fair share of people make their own weight vests or sometimes using a Back Pack loaded with magazines or small sandbags / wood pellets wrapped in contractor bags.

************************************************************************************

If you are new to body-weight training or perhaps body-weight training is your weakness, I want you to begin with a 4 week program that you will follow the workouts 3 x week, every other day workouts work best. Eventually you can work your way up to 4 days or more once you feel your ready.

This will keep you focused on body-weight training and you can still perform any barbell movement *WITH* these workouts using the 5 x 5 method or Martin's prescribed Reverse Pyramid Training. Simply begin your workout with either and then move onto the calisthenic program you've designed for yourself.

There will be less variety in these body-weight workouts because we are more focused on increasing your strength and skill in the basic movements first and foremost. Continue with grip work at the end of at least 50 % of your body-weight workouts. My favorites are the basics, and you can’t get any more basic than working a COC (Captain of Crush Grippers). A few quality sets of focused grip work goes a LONG way. An old saying still true today:

Weak Hands = Weak Man. Google for some grip exercises.

************************************************************************************

Use a simple notebook to track your workouts. Record the exercises, sets, reps and

energy levels for the day. Look back on the workouts often and see if you’re

progressing. (&lt;--Just as Andy has suggested.)

NOTE: Make sure you do some sort of yoga/stretching when you can on off days, you'll feel 20,000x better if

you do!

Also watch some YouTube body-weight training videos so you

understand how to properly &amp; safely modify an exercise if it’s too hard OR too easy for you.

I hope you enjoyed my post and comment/thumb up it if you like what you read.

May the gains be with you all!

(Currently I'm doing this style of training and noticed I'm getting stronger, faster, leaner, vascular, and more muscular as well! Test, test, then retest things I always say! You never know if it will work if you don't try! Edit: Food for thought)

I don't dare to add additional excercises since Martin advocates this short training style. I went until failure or one rep short of failure on all sets but still feel way less exhausted. Will RPT become harder or have I done something wrong while updating my routine?

I have been doing Leangains for roughly a month now by slowly implementing it.  My questions are:

I can't seem to find many female success stories? Are there any women out there with success on Leangains? If so how long did it take and how did you implement it?

How low is too low in terms of macros and calories? If tracking them weekly - has intake spiked on training days and created a deficit on rest days? Or has it been consistent regardless?

Small meals or large meals? Is it right to assume that 2-3 larger meals in the feeding window is better in terms of reducing insulin increas versus spreading small meals out in the feeding window?

How have women responded to alcohol?

My question comes from the fact that everywhere I read, I should REALLY be feeling the side effects... My issues is I don't feel any. No bump in blood pressure, twitchiness, chest pains, etc.

I'm a ~5-cup-of-coffee-a-day guy, so I'm curious if I'm just used to being on stimulants?  Anyone else have this issue, or did I possible by some dud powder? I decided to buy off amazon:

2. Next to this it says that '2 typical fried thigh fillets (150g)' = 280 Calories. Given that there are 4 fillets in the pack, this would mean that there should be a total of 560 Calories in the pack and not 825 so what is the reason for the difference?

I've read the FAQ and got some great information; I just wanted some input/validation that what I've got is right.  A little back-story, I've been eating low-carb for a little over a year.

As one can imagine, this left me a smaller version of me, but with the same proportions. (Lots of fat in the thighs and glutes... I know.)

So far, the results have been good. I've lost 2"" from my hips, 1"" from each thigh, and half an inch from my waist over the course of three weeks. Furthermore, my bf% has shot down to under 15% for the first time since I was a young lad, and I've never had more energy. 

But during this period, I've had my share of issues adapting to the diet...

Before I started LG, my diet was 1200-1500 calories per day with minimal carbs. Needless to say, I found the prospect of eating MORE to achieve my goals (to lean-out while dropping the remaining fat from my legs primarily, and of course the rest of my body as I'm fully aware that spot-reduction is a load of bs.) to be quite unnerving. I mean, as a former 'big guy', less food = good has always been the prominent ideology for me, and as such I was skeptical. (Nevertheless, the aforementioned results have been promising thus far.)

But psychology aside, I faced a few *physiological* issues when adapting to the re-introduction of carbs, namely brain fog and mild constipation, as well as the need to pee at stupid o'clock in the morning.

The brain fog, thankfully, has cleared now so I can focus on my studies. The peeing, however, is an issue which I hope buggers-off soon, as I function pretty badly on a poor night's sleep.

Now the constipation was worrying as I would go three or four days without any sort of bowel movement. I firstly attributed this to the new whey I was taking, but abstaining from it did not solve my problem. I then realised that my fiber in comparison to my newly-bolstered protein intake was, well, pitiful. Especially on rest days.

This is where *drum rolls* PSYLLIIUM HUSK TABLETS APPEAR! I picked two pots of these bad boys up in Holland and Barrett in their penny sale today (£12 per pot, but the second pot is a penny), and I must say they are FANTASTIC. Honestly, I popped two of these with my lunch and BOOM. An hour later I had a movement. Did the same with dinner, and guess what? ANOTHER MOVEMENT! 

Now I don't plan on relying on these; I know my fiber is lacking and so more veggies are a must. But for me certainly, they have fixed my bowel issues.

Ultimately, this is just a post to plug these handy little capsules. I know they don't work for everyone, but if there is someone experiencing what I did out there in need of a possible solution, these are for you.

I am now finishing a weight loss from 240lbs in May 2012 (this pic does not have may 12-current, just april 13-current) PIC: http://imgur.com/a/vj0w6

A journey indeed.

Currently, I am 6'3"", 170lbs, male, activity sedentary (10 hours a day sitting), IIFYM and IF scheduling.  I hit the gym four days a week (not in this order, but here's the outline):

* Chest/tri &amp; HIIT
* Back/bi &amp; HIIT
* Shoulders/abs, HIIT
* Legs, LISS
* LISS
* LISS
* Full rest (daily activity only)

A little background: have been overweight my entire life and never had abs.  I also had barely any strength when I began the weight loss (followed by fuckarounditis for the first six months or so).  Beginning lifts to now (measured at approx 3x5):

* BENCH: 65lbs &gt; 135lbs
* SQUAT: Bar &gt; 155lbs
* OHP: 40lbs &gt; 80lbs
* DEADLIFT: 155lbs &gt; 205lbs

My lifts have 100% stalled and I am making zero progress with increasing numbers.  I expected this based on my sustained caloric deficit.  I do 16/8 IF, but am crazy hungry at all points of the day, even whilst drinking four quarts of water per day at minimum and taking Green Tea extract (newb mistake, but finishing it since I paid for it).  Since I did IIFYM, I never really ""cheated"", but there were a few days I'd be off on my macros if I had a family dinner.  For instance, super high on fat and carbs/low protein, or any combination, however I tried to sustain my caloric requirements daily.  Never really had a refeed period/day or a blow-out day, either.

Here is a picture of my IF Calculations going forward: http://imgur.com/a/o1DIF

Can anyone provide feedback going forward?  What BF% do you think I am at?  As I mentioned earlier, I desperately want visible abs, but I understand that may not be possible this time around.

I’m 24-years-old, and 6ft 1.5in (186.69cm) tall. I weigh 67.1kg (147.93lbs). My goal weight is 83kg (183lbs). I'm very skinny at present, and I've lost quite a bit of muscle mass. I am prepared to adhere to the strictest of regimes, and work-out as often as required (though I’ve read that 4 times a week is plenty). 

Using the Harris Benedict Formula, my BMR is 1749. 2712 is my Total Daily Energy Expenditure, and it’s the amount of calories I need to consume every day to maintain my weight - if I’m ‘Moderately Active’ (defined as “moderate exercise / sports 3-5 days per week”). The next category up was  ‘Very Active’ (defined as “hard exercise / sports 6-7 days a week”). Picking the second category would obviously result in consuming more calories, but I think the former category of ‘Moderately Active’ is more apt as I intend on doing 4 days of heavy weights per week.

To gain weight, I’ve read that I should eat an additional 500 calories every day to gain a pound per week. However, according to the calculator on www.1percentedge.com/ifcalc/, I should consume 3525 calories on work-out days and 2441 calories on rest days. I picked Option 2 for weight gain, which was -10% maintenance calories on rest days and +30% maintenance calories on work-out days. [This is the macro-split I need to adhere to according to the calculator](http://i.imgur.com/FFUc3Is.png). 

Q1. Is it necessary to consume so many carbs? I've read that carbs don't do much for you apart from give you energy, and that excess carbs turn to fat. 

Q2. Does the above macro-split and calorie consumption seem sensible? I'm going for a bulk but with as little fat gain as possible. 

**Weight-lifting**

There is so much information out there that I'm completely lost - could anybody please post up a work-out schedule that encompasses a full-body work-out and will result in lean gains and quality muscle. In short, I plan on working-out on Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays and Sundays (with the days inbetween being rest days) - but I'm not sure what I should actually do on the work-out days e.g. arms? if so, which movements? etc. I will work out for 1hr each day. 

Q3. As I'm going for a bulk, should I cut out cardio completely? I was intending on doing 20 mins of HIIT and 20 mins of rowing on my rest days. Should I can all cardio? 

Any guidance would be very much appreciated. I've done quite a bit of research, but I'm still not comfortable - I'd like to know that I'm doing the right thing before I begin.

How can I best structure meal timing?,16,4,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/leangains/comments/18ttg8/is_leangains_possible_with_my_strange_work/,"**SUPEREST EDIT:** I think I've actually found a schedule by just... bumping my lunch time back by one hour. Easy. Why I didn't think of it sooner I don't know. [PLANNED SCHEDULE!](http://i.imgur.com/mHLVEr1.png). I'll treat my extra ""mini lift days"" as rest days as I really only lift for like 30 minutes those days. It just targets one muscle group.  
  
It has been brought to my attention that LeanGains might be the best solution to help me drop below the level of 10% bodyfat I appear to be stuck at, but my work schedule is weird and doesn't fit close to ANY leangains structure on the main site.  
  
My working and lifting currently looks like this.  
  
* I wake up for work at 5am and eat a small breakfast (250 calories, 17g protein, 28g carbs, 8g fat).  
  
* I eat lunch at 11am (Around 540 kcal, 54g protein, 56g carbs, 4~10g fat - lunch isn't always identical, but it's always 1 cup rice and 10oz of some meat)  
  
* I get off work at 4pm and arrive home at 6pm, have 226g cottage cheese, take Jack3d (with DMAA) at 6:30pm, and begin lifting at 7pm.  
  
* After this I eat dinner around 8:30pm  
  
I lift Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday. I use either GVT or GBC for my program, alternating every 7 weeks. I also add in an additional shorter session during my lunch on Wednesday and Friday. These shorter sessions are designed to target a lagging muscle group (right now Wednesday is Forearms/Calves/Traps, and Friday is all Back).  
  
This means I lift at 7pm 3 days a week, and 11am twice a week. Regardless, this seems like it will fuck up my meal timing MASSIVELY on **every** day of the week.  
  
How on earth am I supposed to time my meals? At first I thought I'd just skip that breakfast and fast from 8pm to 11am (which is ~15 hours) and have lunch, and then just eat my last two meals at 6pm and 8pm. I figured I'd do that every day, and just not worry about the extra two lifting days I add in, but that doesn't seem like accurate enough timing.  
  
Any help on how to time my meals? :/
  
Edit: Side note, if my goal is cutting, should I still do +20/-20 or should I just do a slight caloric deficit every day?  
  
**Edit 2: Thoughts I've had since posting...**  

  
I'm 6'2"", 220 lbs, 22 year old male, who spends about 21 hours a day stationary because of sleep and work. My estimated bodyfat is between 10 and 14% (unfortunately can't get more accurate, I look pretty different day to day right now. Some days I have 4 visible abs, some days it just looks flat with no definition). Would I expect results if I did a -30/+10 split (rest day/work day) for my macros and then ate and lifted as such:  
  
* 11am - first meal, 25% of calories.  
* 6pm - take Jack3d  
* 6:30pm - lift!  
* 7:30pm - main meal, 60-75% of calories  
* 8:30pm - last foods/snacks, 15% or whatever is left if any  
* 10pm - bed  
  
This gives a 14.5 hour fast :/ not quite 16 hours. I COULD just do two meals and do ALL my eating excluding the small lunch after the workout, but I don't know if LeanGains allows that. If I did just the two meals I could be done eating at night by 7pm, giving a 16 hour fast.

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AtgR-pQGNWuKdGZzTlRzTWp2S01zckdJa1ZqSU02Vnc&amp;usp=sharing

To use it: 

First, make a copy into your own google docs. 

The **Weeks Breakdown** sheet is your workout for 4 cycles with breakdown by day and exercise. If it's a bar lift (e.g. deads) it'll subtract out the bar and split it up into plates. So a 205 dead looks like ""5@45,35"" -- 2 45s, 2 35s + 45 bar. 325 dead would be 45,45,45,5.  I _think_ the math is working correctly, let me know if it's not. This spreadsheet uses a bit of Javascript so I'm not sure if that will translate over when you make a copy. Again, let me know. 

The **Sources** sheet is where you can add your own exercises and alter the progression numbers, reps etc. There's things in there to alter the exercises like whether they use the bar, can use negative weight, use body weight and so on. 

Let me know if you have any improvements or see any problems. If you think I need to move some lifts to different days, please let me know. 

**The way I use this**: print the breakdown sheet onto a single sheet of paper, tuck that into pocket with a pen. Head to gym, do lifts, cross off the days as you complete them or make notes. The paper should fold up so that one week will fit onto a 1/4 sheet of paper. 

Here's what's on the list already:

Also, BF% estimate please?",16,5,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/leangains/comments/183s4y/my_leangains_progress_story_also_bf_estimate/,"Hey guys! So I've been cutting on leangains since about Nov 17, about 12 weeks to date. Thought I'd share my story and progress so far.

LeanGains has treated me quite well. I've lost weight and gained significant strength. Granted, many of these happened due to neurological adaptation and technique and whatnot, since I wasn't used to lifting near max effort for anything other than bench(and I was completely new to deads, newish to squats) but I have been lifting for a couple of years so it's not like I'm a complete novice. After the adaptation the first 2 or 3 weeks, it's basically just been an increase in 1 rep or 1 set. 

These are the changes in strength for my top sets(I use RPT for everything except chins), from Nov 17 up to Feb 5th, or about 11 weeks. Note that I stopped squatting, deadlifting, and rowing heavy for about 4 weeks due to a silly lower back injury unrelated to my lifting, and spent about 2 weeks eating maintenance, without calorie cycling for recovery. Also, no cardio whatsoever.

Weights are in pounds, bodyweight measured under as equal conditions as possible.

Bodyweight: 196-198 lb to 189 lb(Jan 31st). I instantly went up to 193 this week from starting to take creatine.

Deadlifts(3-5) -&gt; 225x5 -&gt;300x5

Seated OHP -&gt; 105x7 -&gt; 125x6

Bodyweight Chin-Ups 5 -&gt; 8

Bench 185 x 3 -&gt; 195 x 7

Pendlay Rows -&gt; 120 x 6 -&gt; 125 x 8

Close Grip Bench -&gt; 120x7 -&gt; 150x8

Squat -&gt;185x5 -&gt; 195x6

Close Grip Barbell Curl -&gt; 55x6 -&gt; 70x7

Of course, I can't presume strength gains forever while on a cut, and indeed my deads, squats, and chins had been stalling the past couple of weeks, and my lower back felt like it never recovered adequately. Thus, I dropped the Close Grip Bench Press and Barbell Curl, and decreased OHP and Rows(now chest supported T-Bar Rows) to just 2 sets. I did this last week and all of my strength stats went back up.

Anyway, pics. I didn't take pics at the very beginning, so this is one from Dec 11:

And this is me as of Feb 6:

http://imageshack.us/a/img685/7632/afterhr.jpg

The creatine is probably helping a little bit(although I can't tell a difference between this week and last week before creatine), but still I think the difference in both fat and muscle is pretty apparent. I seem to have made particular progress my last 3 or 2 weeks due to finally getting my macros right. Also note that during the december pic was right after I had dropped DL's and squats due to my injury.

That being said, can anyone give me a BF estimate for both days? I'm guessing around 16-18 for the first and around 14-16 for the second?

Although I'm still a newb, I've been lifting for some time and never experienced any significant soreness other when I stop lifting for 10+ days and then I get DOMS for 2-4 days after my first workout.  
I do believe that I'm going relatively heavy for what I can lift, as my last couple of reps on the last set on, for example, squats or deadlifts are such that my whole body strains to finish the rep or I just fail.  
As an example my current squat routine is as follows:(5 warm up sets and 3 work sets)  
20kgs(45lbs) 8reps  
30kgs(65lbs) 8reps  
40kgs(88lbs) 8reps  
50kgs(110lbs) 8reps   
60kgs(132lbs) 8reps

80kgs(176lbs) 8reps   
85kgs(187lbs) to failure (sometimes get to 8)  
I'm 6'1"" and ~200lbs
I usually do 3 compound exercises and an accessory in around an hour, 3 times a week. 
But other than DOMS that I feel pretty badly when I first start after a period of stopping from working out, I'm sore-free.  
It might be that I might not be lifting that heavy weights in general but shouldn't soreness be relative to individual strength?

(pics)",16,3,52,http://www.reddit.com/r/leangains/comments/17u19q/already_pretty_lean_should_i_cut_recomp_or_slow/,"Hi All,

Ok so here goes...


I decided early 2012 to get my s*** together and lose some weight. Im not a tall guy (5'7"") but i had accumulated a lot of weight from my mad weekend alcohol binges.

I started going to the gym (with major fuckarounditis) for about 3/4 months but eventually fell out of the habbit as I hadn't really any specific goals. Summer came and passed along with holidays and I hadnt noticed much difference.



So i decided to do Insanity ( I used to be very active so I thought i'd be able for it). So I completed that (with calorie deficit) and lost a good bit of weight, but wanted to tone up a bit more, so I then began GSP's Rushfit in november which I finished yesterday. In total in 2012 I lost close to 40 lbs.

The last 3/4 weeks of Rushfit, I started intermittent fasting. Though it wasn't fully lean gains( it was just a set low amount of calories, and 16 hour fasts) and had good results on that, i lost a chunk of fat of my belly and now fit into trouser size (30"") I haven't fit into in years (i'm 25 next week) and even that's beginning to loosen :)



Now however, I want to add some mass to the tone I achieved from the 2 previous workout programs. The only problem is I still have a small bit of stubborn lower belly fat that i'd also like to get rid of. I'm currently about 144 lbs, 5'7"", not sure about bf% ???



So my question is:
- should I now start at the gym tomorrow morning with proper leangains methods (carb&amp;cal cycling, lifting and minimal cardio) on a cut, recomp or bulk?



PS. If I cut, i know to start with RPT, but as i've been out of the gym nearly a year should I begin with Starting strength on leangains instead??? (My lifts will still be in the novice measurement for bodyweight i'd imagine)

I squat 3 times a week (M, W, F). All last week I was fine. I have been steadily increasing the weight (. each time) since I started last week. This past Monday I squatted fine without any real pain or soreness during or after the lift. The next day (yesterday) I felt fine as well, with a tiny bit of soreness in my back towards the night.

Last night I woke up a few times throughout the night and my back absolutely killed. Bending over hurt (not sure if it was soreness or pain, but I'm not used to soreness being this bad) as well as bending my neck down in front of me. It's been getting better throughout the day, but the soreness/pain is definitely still there.

My theory is that it is because of my form on the low bar squat. Maybe I'm rounding my back. Maybe I'm going too far past parallel. The only thing that confuses me is that I just started feeling it now. Not last week when I started doing low bar. Could it just be that I'm feeling it now because of the added weight? Maybe my bad form was okay when I wasn't lifting as much last week?

I'm also not exactly sure where the middle back becomes the lower back, but it feels like the pain/soreness is mostly directly behind the top of my abs. Is that the middle back?

I'm scheduled to squat, bench, deadlift, and do weighted pullups today. Should I take today off? Should I lift but just not squat or deadlift? Is it safe to bench with this pain/soreness?

Ski season is just about to start and I'm trying to figure out how to make the LG lifestyle work while still being able to ski 1-2 times a week.

The main issue is that skiing is a crazy leg work out and I generally start early (9-10 am) and go into the afternoon (2-3).  Right now my plan is to take BCAA right before I go to last until my feeding window (12:30) and eat a sandwich or clifbar to hold me over until I get home.  I'm thinking eat as if it's a workout day (due to the large number of calories burned) and cut out my friday lifting day (normally I lift M,W,F, doing SS, and I ski sat/sun).

I usually have enough willpower to stay away from these things, but I just truly and utterly *yearn* for something treat-like once in a while, minus the guilt.  I've done searches in /r/Leangains, /r/fitmeals, and Google for ""healthy candy"" and ""healthy snacks"", to sparse avail—the hits are relatively few in the subreddits, and Google tends to merely list the least bad of all the bad candies.

There are some LG-compliant, sweet things that I like just fine, such as yogurt with fruit/agave or practically anything with a tasty protein power (I put Cookies n' Cream whey into my scrambled eggs tonight and it was de*LISH*us—wasn't expecting that).  I guess I'm looking for something a little more elaborate and a lot more different, though.

One idea I've seen (that I haven't figured out yet) is Protein Popcorn.  The recipe I came across suggested bulk kernels microwaved in a paper bag, some coconut oil, and some chocolate protein powder.  I loved the idea, but it's my own preference to cut out unnecessary macros on days I'm not supposed to have them, since I find that I too easily exceed my off-macro on a given day with incidental sources (veggies on rest days, fat from chicken on workout days, etc.).  Even though I followed the recipe, though, and used the specified amount of oil, the powder didn't really adhere to the popcorn anyway and I was left with a weirdly dry mess.  But it's a snack I really like the idea of and will continue to be on the lookout for takes on.

Another thing I'd love to perfect is LG-style no-bakes/pro-bakes.  No-bakes are my **favorite** cookies, but the one recipe I tried fell pretty flat (ate 'em all anyway, since even a bad no-bake is a good cookie).

So those are the types of things I'm interested in.  I'm imagining snacks that are a little more complicated than, say, some honey in Greek yogurt (which is still, of course, the shit).  Here are some other guidelines that it would be nice to meet:

I mainly find myself wanting these things at work, where I don't have access to my kitchen in which I can make amazing shit like frozen-banana/whey protein shakes.  So something portable (like a pro-bake) or makeable in a microwave (like protein popcorn) would be really neat.

A couple weeks ago I thought I'd struck gold when I started trying all the various artificial sweeteners that exist (Equal and Splenda being the tastiest for me), but the more I read about artificial sweeteners, the warier I grew regarding eating that stuff.  The topic is so divisive and contentious that I'd prefer to just stay away from those things for now (just like I do with most soy stuff these days, even though I love plenty of soy things).

Anyway, that's what I've got for my brain dump at the moment.  Basically, I want to satisfy myself with something similar (at first glance) to something one might find at a confectionery, but I want to feel good about eating it, too, heh.  I just bought a candy thermometer recently, and all I've used it for so far is making homemade yogurt (bloody brilliant success, that, but I've eaten so much of it that maybe that's why I'm looking to branch out, hah).  I love to cook, so the difficulty/elaborateness of a given recipe isn't a problem.  So let's put our heads together and figure out some LG Candy!

PS: I realize it's not particularly realistic to expect a dessert-like concoction with either no fat or no carbs, but, after all, I'm posting this in /r/leangains because you guys are obviously on my side when it comes to macro cycling and all that. :)  Let's do our best!

I've been adhering to LG principles for 6 months now. I love the lifestyle! It's been perfect for me because I am a new Dad that used to spend 2 hours a day in the gym doing cardio or lifting but now I can get it in on my lunch break and go straight home after work. Much better for the stress levels of mommy which is good for me. I can no longer get away with spending 10 hours a week of free time in the gym. 

I work in an office that has a small gym. I have been making use of an assisted machine for bench, deads, and squats so that i can increase the weight far more than the dumbbells they offer (DB's only up to 95 lbs) however I have noticed that my lower back is starting to ache. It's not soreness either it feels tweaked and i feel that heavy squats and deads (diff days of course) are to blame. I find myself grimacing if i'm stuck in traffic after work and my lower back starts to hurt. I've been lifting for 12 years and this has never happened until now. Sucks but it is what it is. Since i can't get to a real gym I have to make due with what I can. I'm doing RPT and my gains are:




Back Squat - 285lb x 4, 270 x 6, 260 x 8


Deadlifts - 280lb x 3, 265 x 6, 255 x 8


Bench - 235 x 4, 220 x 6, 205 x 8





Keep in mind this is ""assisted"" so obviously not equal to straight up free weights. 

So I'm looking for advice on a weekly routine that an intermediate can do using mostly or only dumbbells. I'm clueless as to what compound exercises can mimic the effects of the big 3 without stacking plates on a bar. I am planning on buying a barbell that i can bring in for deads at least but that won't be happening for a couple of weeks. Dumbell flat bench should be ok until i max out the dumbells but i have no idea what to do for squats. Any suggestions?  Thanks!

I don't have a gym nearby so I can only work out from home. I've been training with an RKC kettlebell instructor and so far it has been great. I went from about 230lbs, 42.75"" waist to 198 lbs, 35.5"" waist in about 4 months time, basically by following a fairly low carb Paleo diet and by doing kettlebell work-outs 3 times a week (and sprinting once a week) + 16/8 Intermittent Fasting. I recently got a pull-up bar and I use that regularly as well now (I can only manage about 6 chin ups in a row, quite poor but before I couldn't do a single one).
I've been reading quite a lot about the Leangains protocol and it all makes sense to me. I like Martin's scientific and no-nonsense approach. The question is: are kettlebell work-outs heavy enough to be compatible with LG? I have a 16kg and 24kg kettlebell and usually do swings, Goblet squats and Turkish get-ups. I still need to learn cleans, snatching and pressing as technique is key but since I have never done weight lifting before, swings, squats and get-ups are recommended in the kettlebell world to achieve general strength and conditioning.
I've been experimenting a bit with LG and have been upping my carbs and calories on work-out days (usually potatoes, rice and fruit, I aim for about 2200-2400 calories) and trying to limit my intake on rest days (I aim for 1400 calories, but that is tough as I'm so used now to eating fatty food). One thing it has taught me already is embrace the carbs on work-out days as I have so much more strength than before. Low carb helped me shed the initial fat, but I feel I need to start transitioning now.
Anyway, so my question is: do any of you know of people who have seen good gains on a kettlebell (with some pull-ups thrown in) programme only?

I have read the FAQs and Martin's blog etc, actually, from my previous username I also posted a few questions here (had to delete it as my SO found out what my username was, ahem)... I also tried leangains for a month before vacation - blowing results with it. Now starting again (-20/0, more-or-less strict diet). Just wondering...

I haven't yet seen a good success story from a woman on leangains... Why is that? Is that because there just are fewer women on reddit (I've seen some success stories in Martin's blog) or is there something more to it?

Also, I have yet to see a reason for recommendation of a longer eating window for women (14/10 instead of male version of 16/8). Is there (lack of) science behind that? I tried 14/10, but it is difficult to fit that into my schedule - it is much easier just start eating at lunchtime when everybody else does, not 2 hours into work as 14/10 would have me. Also, I have noticed no other side effects, no dizziness, no big hunger... Should I still be doing 14/10 because I am a woman, despite feeling fine with 16/8?

More general... It seems that for workout it is recommended heavy weightlifting to accompany this diet. I did Starting Strength for a bit more than half a year previously and got surprising progress in strength, but I found that this progress is not very functional, not what I want from my body. I get short of breath more easily and I would really like to get some usable/cool skills besides lifting a great amount of weight in a very strict form. So I am thinking of going for bodyweightfitness (Convict Conditioning seems to be a great program for starters, although in two books he mentions feminine trainees only once, I counted) and (interval?) running on alternating days. However, I am at a loss at how to combine this with leangains diet. Should I still be eating the same macros? Should I have the bodyweight circuit day as ""feed day"" and cardio day the ""rest day"" despite cardio being quite intense? I have yet to see a reason why leangains would work only with weightlifting...

EDIT: just remembered another question I had... I was shocked when I first saw the protein intake recommendations, as high protein intake is considered cause for ~~liver damage~~ [kidney stones](http://http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_(nutrient\)#Excess_consumption) (refers a study from 2005, although I didn't read the study full)... Is there something to make it harmless for somebody doing weightlifting? Or something in intermittent fasting diet?

The gist of it is that you all suggested I do a recomp instead of a cut. Anyway, here are the results:

**EDIT**: [progress pics](http://imgur.com/a/8atM8). These aren't really in the same lighting, but it's the best I could do. The difference is kind of subtle but really significant to me. 

Aaaanyway, here's my stats (before/after):

Age: 23/23

Gender: M/M

Height: 5'8""/5'8""

Weight: 145lbs/143lbs

Squats: 125lbs/190lbs (I had to deload a few times to work on form)

Press: 80lbs/105lbs (currently stalled on this, but working on form)

Bench: 110lbs/155lbs

Chins: BWx3 (Failure) / BW + 25 x 5 (RPT-Style)

Deads: 175lbs/240lbs

All of the above are my working sets, not my 1RMs, which I haven't explored.  Additionally, my original body fat percentage was estimated to be 20%, but honestly that was a more or less wild guess. One of my next steps is to pay for some kind of measurement to get an accurate number on that.

Things that I've learned / that have happened:

1. I had to quit running because it was interfering with my recovery. Now that my form is getting better, though, I may start running again. As I said in the previous post, I quit smoking at the start of keto (Almost 5 months now!) so it is really important to me to maintain cardiovascular health. I'm not entirely sure how to incorporate it into my program, but I assume I'll just have to carefully compensate for the calories burned.

2. I don't know if it's psychological, but for some reason I keep getting up to 190lbs on the squat, stalling, and having to deload because of degradation in form. This time, I seriously felt perfect at 185 and was able to crank out 3 sets of 5 easily, but at 190 it was like I'd tripled the weight. Anyone have any insight on that?

3. I have cheated. A lot. I try to compensate for it either that day, or on my next rest day, but I've never cut calories on a training day. I've heard that Martin makes clients choose to prioritize either strength gain or fat loss, so I thought it would help for me to do the same, and I've chosen to consciously focus on strength gain for now. Still, I find myself feeling much more comfortable erring on the side of fewer calories than more, and I still mildly panic when day-to-day water weight fluctuations put me over 145lbs. This is something I'll work on from here.

In terms of progressing, my plan is to keep going on a recomp until I can squat about 250lbs, then reevaluate. I'm not sure how far I can take it while at a deficit, but I still have a decent amount of fat I can burn before I feel that any sort of bulking is appropriate or necessary.

If my daily protein intake is 200g and 100g of lean beef contains 25.88g protein and 5.88g of fat, does my daily intake result in a whopping 700-800g of beef a day?

I usually manage to get ground beef/pork for $3-4/kg from queen vic but chicken is way more expensive than supermarkets.

A marijuana phytocannabinoid known as 'Cannabigerol' has the properties of being an Alpha-2 Adrenergic agonist (the opposite action of Yohimbine) and thus may preserve fat mass.[89] Activation of hepatic CB1 receptors can also induce cellular changes which can be seen as 'pro-obesogenic' such as expression of the gene SREBP-1c which mediates downstream fat synthesis, such as the enzyme fatty acid synthase[86][90]

The enzyme CarnitinePalmitoyltransferase 1_ (COMT1), the rate limiting enzyme of fatty acid Beta-oxidation, is suppressed under the influence of marijuana in the liver[85] yet seems to be elevated in some brain cells, which results in neuronal ketogenesis.[91] Adipose (body fat) cells seem to mimic the liver cell's pro-obesogenic actions more than the neurons actions.[92]""

I mean forget the splits and ratios of fat to carbs, what really matters, and what I've read on Martin's and Lyle McDonald's sites, is that first you want to ingest protein for satiation, then consume some healthy fat, and the rest is up to you.

It seems the problems arise with the hormonal response of insulin and leptin. If you are eating only 1400 calories on rest day and mainly consuming carbs, then your body will be hungrier sooner and leptin levels will trigger your body to be hungry at that time the next day. That's why it's best to choose protein as the bulk of your calories on rest day as it will a) not trigger a huge spike in insulin b) will keep you full longer and prevent hunger pangs the same time the next day and c) is the best of the 3 macros to prevent body protein breakdown while IF

Age: 23

Weight: 83kg 

Height: 180cm

Goals: Cut before recomp

Current BF: 16.5%

Total Daily Calories: R 1568 (-30%) T 2464 (+10%)

Fat: R 80 T 40 (approx)

Protein: R 183 T 183

Carbs: R 30 T 340 (approx)

Hour Breakdown: Eat 2pm-10pm (usually 2 meals per day, sometimes 3)

Your Training History: 3 years on/off (bordering on fuckarounditis)

Your Program: RPT m/w/f evenings following one pre workout meal (roughly 20% daily intake), no/little cardio hence a 'sedentary' activity level.



I'm currently 4 weeks in and 3kg down with no noticable muscle or strength loss. I was previously on a typical bb bulking diet eating 5-6 times a day with protein/mass shakes. Now I eat all whole foods with no shakes and i feel much better in terms of general mood, digestion and great focus during the fasted period.



My current goal is to cut down to a stage where i can begin recomp (i.e 12% bf) whilst maintaining muscle/strength hence a 30/10 setup.



I work 9-5 and train in the evenings from 6-7pm. Workouts revolve around compound moves in a RPT setup, sample this week -



Mon - Deadlift (4/5/6) 100kg -10/20%,  BB Rows (4/5/6) 70kg -10/20%, Pull ups (4x6) bodyweight


Wed - BB Bench Press (4/5/6) 92.5kg -10/20%, Military Press (4/5/6) 47.50kg -10/20%, Dips (3x8) bodyweight


Fri - Squats (4/5/6) 110kg -10/20%, Leg Extensions (3x8) 45kg each leg



This is only my second week of RPT following a 3x8 split routine using mostly compounds so I'm still getting use to the setup/weight.



In conclusion the first month has been a good experience with noticable fat loss (3kg), of course this could be partly water coming off a bulking diet, but still impressive. It took a good 2 weeks to adjust to the eating patterns and get the calorie/macros right, but now i sail through to 2pm with just black coffee/water in the morning.



Sometimes i find it difficult just consuming 1600 calories on rest days whilst getting the protein/fats i require but using an app like myfitnesspal (highly recommended for anybody trying to count calories/macros) makes it more managable. Training days are easy to get calories/macros in and sometimes I add a treat but generally eat clean on both days (have always eaten clean).



If you have any questions or comments on my setup please post away!

The context was that a new ""LG"" dieter was asking for advice about whether integrating a solid ""conditioning"" (read: running) program into a lifting regimen was a LeanGains-approved idea. A vocal member of this community was arguing that Berkhan 'advocated' HIIT cardio for fat loss, and went on to assure OP that all was roses. Myself and a few others were very skeptical of this advice.

Frankly, I've been seeing a lot of this lately-- the notion of what ""is"" and ""isn't"" LeanGains has been wayyy too unrigorous and needs a reality check. So since I don't think it got enough eyeballs/debate going in that thread, I want to put this here so we can all discuss this issue openly.

---

I'll come out swinging: cardiovascular conditioning and strength training are not hand-in-hand goals, and a rigorous cardio regimen is NOT part of the LeanGains protocol. LeanGains is a dieting scheme for optimizing strength/mass gains while minimizing (or losing) fat. It's targeted to strength/mass athletes and individuals after body recomposition, not so-called ""metabolic conditioning"". While fasted endurance workouts have become *en vogue* lately, LG itself has no claims to being a 'good' program for cardio training and there's no reason to think its macro recommendations, fasting windows and meal partitions are ideal or even useful for cardiovascular training. Some stuff to chew on in the debate:

* [A nice post from a while back on bb.com summarizes Berkhan's recommendations vis-a-vis cardio](http://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=131542323&amp;p=638829893&amp;viewfull=1#post638829893):

&gt;I am in disagreement with Tom's cardio recommendations and consider them counterproductive. Especially if used in the context mentioned in the book. After weights, or 8 hrs after weights, is about the worst time to do cardio**. The research he cites to claim that moderate amounts of cardio can help muscle growth is also flat out wrong (or cherry-picked).

Translation: Cardio after weight training is not recommended.

&gt; Add cardio or whatever else to get your energy expenditure up. A personal favorite of mine is lower intensity and longer duration activities like walking in the 12-16 hour time interval of the fast. Not only is this the ""golden age"" of subcutaneous fat oxidation, but lower intensity activities selectively use fatty acids to fuel the activity. There are other reasons I favor low intensity over high intensity activities (such as HIIT). They interfere minimally with your performance in the gym and can be done on a daily basis, which is not the case with HIIT.

Translation: If you must do cardio, then low intensity cardio in the closing hours of the fast (before weight training) is acceptable. Low intensity = walking; *not* jogging, not running, and **not HIIT**.

&gt; Elevated levels of cortisol can cause water retention, potentially due to interfering with aldosteron (a hormone that regulates fluid balance). Excessive cardio, particularly of the more intense variety (HIIT), and low calorie intakes increases cortisol... Only do low intensity steady state cardio, such as walking or similar activities with a low perceived rate of effort.

Translation: Only do LISS such as walking or similar activities. The exertion should be far below the threshold of endurance athletics.

&gt;Some people rely heavily on cardio in order to maintain their leanness. This allows them to be somewhat more lenient with their diet. I am however no fan of cardio and don't use it to stay lean. In my view cardio as a strategy to maintain a low body fat percentage is not only time-consuming, but also a sure-fire way to hamper muscle and strength gains. If nor time or muscle gain is a concern then by all means continue your cardio regimen. But considering my priorities and those of my clients, I focus on the macrocomposition of the diet to maintain the lean state.

Let's repeat it for emphasis: **I am no fan of cardio and don't use it to stay lean**. LeanGains is first and foremost a diet and strength training protocol, and throwing in cardio to the mix is ""a surefire way to hamper muscle and strength gains"".

Now, what about that ol' beginner zOMG impulse of ""But I'm super-motivated and want to lose fat quickly!"" ?

&gt; Never attempt to train yourself into a caloric deficit. Don't spend hours on the treadmill. Diet comes first, cardio second. The dumbest fat loss strategy ever devised is used by people that wake up early in the morning before going to work to do cardio and follow that up with ""recovery shake."" Congratulations, you just wasted two hours of your life. Cardio is good for cardiovascular health, but most people use cardio as a fat loss tool - and force themselves through regimens that aren't very conducive to their daily routine (or mental sanity). Next time, skip the shake and the cardio. Sleep two hours longer, but skip breakfast and fast until lunch time. This way you can create the same caloric deficit with the added bonus of feeling more rested and having saved more time. You'll be much better off.

* [Berkhan responded to this post directly and outlined his reasons for his recommendations](http://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=131542323&amp;p=639771283&amp;viewfull=1#post639771283). 

I won't repeat these here, but IME these are all correct and valid considerations, and underscore something that's been known in physical training circles for some years now: strength and cardio conditioning interfere with each other, and doing both vigorously at the same time will get you less progress than choosing either separately. (This 'interference' phenomenon is more true of strength training than cardio, incidentally; but cardio is *not* a priority in LG.)

---

So all of this begs the question: is cardio consonant with LeanGains? Considering that LeanGains is a protocol explicitly for strength and mass athletes or people interested in body recomposition, the answer is **no**: cardio in the way that people think of it (medium and high intensity) is not part of the program, and doing it will actively inhibit the objectives of the protocol. However, a little back-door has been thrown in there to accommodate all the cardio junkies of the world by explicitly approving LISS cardio *at the intensity of walking*. This back-door, however, should not be abused as a wedge to accommodating all sorts of other activities--as it often is.

Now: can cardio ""work"" on LG? If you take ""work"" to mean ""Will I make progress in my workouts?"", then the answer is **yes of course it can**, provided you eat enough to sustain all of your activities. But understand that LG is not intended to be an optimizing diet for cardio work; and while there's some evidence that you could make good progress in your cardio efforts (fasted endurance training) doing something *similar* to LG, there's lots of reasons to think you will actively harm/make mediocre progress in your strength training/body recomposition efforts. (See the 2nd link for a few reasons for this.) And if your primary goals aren't strength or mass building or body recomposition, then why the hell are you doing LG?

...

Which takes us to the million-dollar question: if not LG, can you ""do cardio"" while doing some kind of cyclical calorie dieting scheme? 

Yes you surely can, but **you can't call that LeanGains and you can't point to the LG community's results to substantiate your ideas**. You're essentially doing your own thing--which is perfectly fine--but recognize that there are legitimate reasons for *why* the protocol is outlined the way it is; i.e., it's successful at what it aims for.

Longtime lurker here, and I've decided it's about time to introduce myself to the community. TBH, I *just* yesterday learned the meaning behind all of our jargon and acronyms, how to count macros, etc. after having finally read the FAQ and guides. I've been involved in athletics all of my life, have an extensive background in lifting, martial arts and other sports, but have never, and I mean never, took the time to learn how to properly track my progress other than simple calorie counting. I have, however, been [consciously] fasting intermittently more or less for the past 2 years (and unconsciously fasting since I was a child as I've never been keen on breakfast); I prefer 4 hours in calories, but honestly I treat my fasts sort of like dissonance in jazz, meaning that one day I'll go 18:6, another day 22:2, an occasional 36:6. (Mind you I'm also a big fan of caloric deficit, which I'm sure will prompt criticism, which I'm absolutely open to!)

I will track my progress for 30 days “ending” on Sept. 12th. I'll post once near the beginning of each week (this post essentially doesn't count), and will include my entire workout as well as every single thing I put in my mouth and their macros for each of the days.

**Here's the catch**: I'm in Ecuador at the moment with no access to a gym, but more importantly am recovering from multiple major injuries, so this will be purely experimental.

On my workout days (5 days) I will be doing: 

* ~~at the very least 550 pushups (the majority of them are on my finger tips or knuckles) in a mixture of 50, 30, and 20 reps while doing as many variations as I can,~~ but I am limited because of a level 2 AC joint separation from a bicycling accident;

* ~~at least 100 air squats in a mixture of 25, 20, and 15 reps, and sometimes resisted with a band;~~

* ~~resistance band training to help rehab my shoulder;~~

* an intensive stretch routine that lasts for a minimum of 45 minutes;

* and a variety of slow martial arts movements i.e. holding static stances, shadowboxing and shadow-kickboxing and etc. that lasts for a minimum of 45 minutes.

On my rest days (2 days) I will still perform ~~air squats, resistance training,~~ stretching and martial arts~~, but instead will bring down the # of pushups to 250, no more and no less.~~

Everyday I'll be briskly walking an average of 2 miles.

Also please consider that I'm recovering from a second right knee ACL tear (first time was a full tear from American football, operated Feb. '06, and the second was only partial from jumping into intensive kickboxing and kicking heavy bags after having been “cold turkey” for almost three years, operated Apr. '13), as well as a [**deep laceration worth 14 stitches**](http://imgur.com/oiX4FRr) **[graphic]** on the same goddamn knee (operated Oct. '13) from the same goddamn bicycling accident that injured my shoulder. I also caught an inguinal hernia on my right side in Mar. '07 and had it operated on Jan. '08, so that's yet another injury that I have to constantly be wary of.

**Here are my stats**:

* 22y/o male

* 5'8”

* 149.8lbs (as of Sept. 12th)

* Body fat % is unknown **(do y'all have any estimates for me based on pics?)**

* Waist is 31.98 measured at its girthiest

In the IF Calculator I put “moderately active” **(do y'all think this is appropriate or should I insert “lightly active” instead?)**, and here are my macros for a **-10/+20**, **1g/lb**, and a **25/75** split...

* Rest days: **107**g carbs, **142.6**g fat, **149.8**g protein (2311 calories)

* Workout days: **465.4**g carbs, **68.9**g fat, **149.8**g protein (3081)

* Week calories: 18,486

* Week TEE: 17,973

* TDEE: 2578

~~TBH I don't think I'll be able to hit my carbs on workout days (definitely not calories), nor do I really care whether or not I do.~~ As I said I'm a big fan of caloric deficit, and also eat mostly paleo, but seeing that I'm trying out lean massing, I'll try my best to eat more. Also worthy of notation is that I don't hesitate to regularly hit upwards of 200-225g of protein because fresh fish and lean meats are so cheap here.

Please, please, please offer any advice, experience, suggestions and especially criticism you have for me; and also feel free to **a**sk **m**e **a**nything!

I was hoping if i could get an estimate of my BF%? I am 5'10, 182lbs, 19M, and i fit into 33 waist jeans, so I guess my waist is around 33 inches? give or take

I have practically no experience in weight training. I've worked out randomly sometimes for like a 1 month at a time, but not consistently at all and i pretty much just fucked around anyway. Ramadan just finished so i can drink water during the day now. its time for a change.

I was confused as to how I should control my calorie intake on rest/workout days. I was reading a few threads and some people told others to bulk (even tho they were overweight) because they have never worked out before, and some have said the opposite and say to cut. I wanted to see what calorie intake you guys would recommend for me. 

Ideally, this is my goal for the next 12/16 months.

I'm seven lbs heavier than his example, 207, so I'm pretty damn close to his examples in his AMA. On myfitness.com I'm roughly 313/289 setup for protein: my question is how the hell does anyone get up that high?  I've seen a little bit here and there about people complaining about it but don't recall any real solutions. Do you guys just eat a ton of egg whites and chicken breast? I love steak but it's shockingly calorically dense and chicken breast is getting reeeealy old lol. 

I remember reading a recent study (sorry, I don't have the link) that basically proved 100g of protein a day is plenty for building; according to 31minutes AMA though he says he shoots higher because it forces him to be ""choosier"" food-wise for the calories. So...what have you guys found the best way to get that many grams of protein in a day? My knowledge seems limited to egg whites, chicken breast, and a good protein powder. Any other routes I've overlooked?

so like, he doesn't really practice 16/8.. apparently it's more like 23/1... basically stuffing his face for 30-60 minutes nonstop until food is done and over with after a workout or cardio.

and it's not just eating random ass foods... he had a list of the **same** foods he eats day in and day out (varies whether it's a [training day](http://tk.reddit.com/r/leangains/comments/1jjrci/former_berkhan_client_ama/cbfoyv1) or [rest day](http://tk.reddit.com/r/leangains/comments/1jjrci/former_berkhan_client_ama/cbfpwt3)). so that simplifies the hell out of it.

so he's basically eating his *favorite* foods every god damned day...  and staying within the optimum macro and caloric intake at the same time.

but the coolest part about all this is how much it FREES UP YOUR MIND... i mean shit, we think about food a lot... well, it helps that we have the fasting-phase so we don't have to think about it as often but still, with all the calorie counting and macro ratios, it's so easy to overthink things.

so i've started to make a list of foods that I personally enjoy like crazy, so that one day i could maybe create the perfect meal that I could eat all in one go just to try it out, you know?

this probably won't work so well considering i live with other people and we share food, but i'm going to try anyway because it's a good exercise to figure out.

I am putting so much time into trying to figure out my ratios for the day (I know, but I am just starting, give me a break), only to discover today that the food database shows HUGE differences between identical foods. I only noticed this because I put in ""avocado slice"" and the first result was a generic entry. When I selected it, it came up with no fat grams listed, only calories. I chose another entry, and everything was different. Which means that I have potentially been WAY OFF every day, and not hitting my macros or even coming close. I am cutting, which means calorie intake is most important for me, and second is hitting my macros. Short of meticulously creating each food on my own and limiting my meals to only what I have calculated myself, how in the world am I supposed to be confident that I have hit my goals for the day? MyFitnessPal has a lot of other quirks that I don't like, such as forcing me to change my daily goals from training to rest days, letting some foods ""fall off"" my frequent list, forcing me to search for it again (and getting an entirely new data set), and basically making the whole process extremely labor-intensive.
