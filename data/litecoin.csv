1364672293.0,79,self.litecoin,1bbfdc,Will mining Litecoins make me more money than Bitcoins? (Answer: YES),106,27,40,http://www.reddit.com/r/litecoin/comments/1bbfdc/will_mining_litecoins_make_me_more_money_than/,"Hi, I have held Bitcoins for a while and have recently started converting them to Litecoins.   I would like to share why.

I think a lot of the activity in this subreddit is from people realizing that GPU mining of Bitcoin is becoming unprofitable;  you are looking to Litecoin as your latest venture.  If that's what you're here for, then you're on the right track!

Litecoin is by far the most popular alternative cryptocurrency, and for very good reason.  It holds strong to the core architecture of the Bitcoin, inheriting most of Bitcoin's codebase.  This is a good thing.  Where it differs, it differs in well thought and beneficial ways.  Where it doesn't, it inherits the time tested strengths of Bitcoin.

In particular, there are four times more Litecoins that will be generated than Bitcoins.  Also, the target time for new blocks is every 2.5 minutes instead of Bitcoin's 10 minutes.  This means that transaction verifications start happening faster.

The big difference though is that Litecoin's proof of work algorithm is Scrypt.  Scrypt replaces Bitcoin's SHA-256.  This is a major change which affects the type of computers that can be used for mining.

Bitcoin over the next half a year will become almost entirely mined by ASICs because GPU miners are so much less efficient at computing Bitcoin's SHA-256 algorithm.  The difficulty will become so high that GPU miners will actually lose money to electricity costs.

On the other hand,  Litecoin's Scrypt algorithm is specifically designed to be hard to make an efficient ASIC for.  Scrypt is meant to work efficiently on general purpose computing hardware, so your GPU will not have unfair competition against it.  Not only that, but Litecoins are already consistently more profitable to mine than Bitcoins.  If you watch the charts [here](http://dustcoin.com/mining), you'll very often find Litecoins producing 10-30% better yields than Bitcoin.

And that's only at the current exchange rates!  I personally find Litecoins to be undervalued relative to Bitcoin by a very large margin.  This is for multiple reasons.  First, Litecoins are much newer and have had very little media attention.  Second, Litecoins are still in very early stages in terms of market support.

You could think of Bitcoin currently as a toddler and Litecoin as an infant (with other altcoins being still in the womb and looking for a reason to be birthed).  Bitcoin can now be easily exchanged with most major world currencies and there is a growing network of tools which make it easier, more secure, and cheaper than credit for merchants to accept Bitcoins even if all they want is their normal national currency.  Litecoin is just now growing similar support, but it is coming!   It is already easy to exchange your Bitcoins for Litecoins through btc-e.com and I expect the better Bitcoin exchanges and merchant services will adopt Litecoin support as interest continues to rise.  When it's ready, we'll see a wave of value increase similar to what Bitcoin has seen.

I have seen a lot of people question why Litecoin or any altcoin needs to exist outside of Bitcoin and had to question it a lot myself before I jumped into Litecoins because I didn't see many good arguments out there.  Most were based on poor assumptions of the fundamentals of the architectures and didn't really establish a solid ground for the longterm coexistence of multiple cryptocurrencies.

Then I realized that it is important for at least two cryptocurrencies which are secured by different classes of hardware to exist because it provides greater security and stability to the system of cryptocurrencies as a whole.  For one, it makes the total available computing power for securing the networks greater which improves their total security.  Mining is how cryptocurrencies are secured, and the more mining there is the more reliable their transaction systems are.  For two, it ensures that markets can't be brought to a halt if there's a temporary issue with one cryptocurrency.  Finally, a coin which can be secured with general purpose hardware (that is, Litecoin) is harder for governments to regulate against because it means that EVERYONE can mine them no matter what; governments won't ban general purpose computers, but they might ban crypto-hashing ASICs (and there are already countries which are unable to import the existing ASICs).

Imagine when all exchanges and merchant tools integrate Bitcoin and Litecoin, and cryptocoins are accepted everywhere.  You can hold both and be sure that you're always able to buy groceries on the spot.  Even if a bug causes a blockchain fork on one of the networks and merchants start holding transactions for them temporarily, your phone's cryptocoin app could just say ""Bitcoins temporarily unstable.  Use Litecoins instead?""  You walk home with bread and don't have to hope you still have cash.

So my best recommendation for you is to mine and (mostly) hold Litecoins.  Spend them whenever you can, but replace what you spend by exchanging your national currency for more Litecoins.  If you can afford to, buy as much as you can of Bitcoins and Litecoins with your national currency.  Personally, I am mostly buying Litecoins because I think they're more undervalued than Bitcoins.

P.S.: I go into more depth on why cryptocoin diversity is good and why it's good to have a coin which is efficient to mine on GPUs in my earlier posts on [Cryptocurrency Market Evolution](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1ampih/cryptocurrency_market_evolution/) and the [Long Term Future of Cryptocurrencies](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1b5e3f/the_future_of_cryptocurrencies_long_term/).

**EDIT:**  A few days after I posted this a Venezuelan posted [asking about Litecoin](http://www.reddit.com/r/litecoin/comments/1bny62/litecoin_for_the_3rd_world/).  In Venezuela, exchange of currencies (Bolivar to USD, for example)  is illegal and it makes ordering anything internationally near-impossible.  They are also unable to import ASICs.  In the thread they discussed mining Litecoins in order to provide a means of converting their local currency to something which could be exchanged internationally legally.  This is a perfect example of where Bitcoins can't help but Litecoins really shine.

**EDIT 2:** Litecoins are trading around $4 each.  I recently wrote about why I think [Litecoins are still undervalued](http://www.reddit.com/r/litecoin/comments/1bpml0/litecoin_4x_undervalued_at_4/).

**EDIT 3:** Litecoins are now valuable enough and the mining levels are high enough that the network is becoming pretty secure.  Now is the perfect time to get more people to accept Litecoins for goods and services.

1366553494.0,59,self.litecoin,1cssqr,The Math: Why litecoin is more secure than bitcoin,82,23,48,http://www.reddit.com/r/litecoin/comments/1cssqr/the_math_why_litecoin_is_more_secure_than_bitcoin/,"###Background:

This came out of some research I put into finding out the probability of a 51% attack for bitcoin.  You'd think that mining 6 blocks in a row would be hard to do, even with 50% hashing power, because most people would probably think about a coin flip and how likely it is to flip 6 heads in a row.  Intuitively it seems like a hard thing to do but in reality, if you do it enough times, it becomes not only possible, but [downright likely, even with a mere 100 coin flips](http://wizardofodds.com/image/ask-the-wizard/streaks.pdf) (warning:pdf).

With bitcoin mining 144 blocks per day a 51% attack with 50% hashing power is just as likely.  [Even with 35% hashing power it's relatively trivial to pull off](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1cr2r2/a_pool_with_35_hashing_power_has_a_992_chance_of/). The reason most people probably haven't thought about this before is because the math itself isn't very straitforward.  According to askamathematician.com, [it is a tough question to answer with a simple formula](http://www.askamathematician.com/2010/07/q-whats-the-chance-of-getting-a-run-of-k-successes-in-n-bernoulli-trials-why-use-approximations-when-the-exact-answer-is-known/).  Thankfully there are computer programs which can do this.  [This site](http://www.pulcinientertainment.com/info/Streak-Calculator-enter.html) has a javascript ""streak"" calculator that will calculate the odds of a doing a 51% attack.  Just put in 1008 trials for a 1 week period (6\*24\*7), your streak length of 6 blocks, and a probability of .35 for 35% hashing power.  The result is about a 70% probability over a 1 week period and a 99.2% chance over a 1 month period.

Sense all the legwork had been done solving this problem for bitcoin I thought I'd run the math again for litecoin and what I found is actually quite surprising.  Litecoin isn't just more secure than bitcoin, it is *orders of magnitude* more secure than bitcoin.

　

###Gambler's Ruin ／ why litecoin is more secure than bitcoin:

I figure the reason is in both cases you're trying to ""beat the odds"" and mine every single block for a 1 hour period but with more ""roles of the dice"" occuring during that same period of time it's a lot harder to keep up your winning streak with litecoin than it is for bitcoin. 

While a bitcoin pool with 35% hashing power can reasonably expect to be able to pull off a 51% attack within one week, that same hashing power for litecoin makes it almost impossible, not just for a 1 week period, but for an entire year, even for 100 years!

The numbers here are 4,032 trials per week and 24 blocks in a row.  The result is 0.0000029760539%.  The same problem over a month and a year is about the same and over 100 years the probability is a mere 0.0155609472527%.  At 50% hashing power and 100 years an attacker has a 46.46% chance (6.06% for a 10 year period) but bitcoin hits both those thresholds in under 1 day.  At 100 years bitcoin is vulnerable to a miner holding just 8% hashing power, while litecoin remains secure all the way up to 50%.  No matter how you run the numbers litecoin remains significantly more secure -- entire worlds more secure -- than bitcoin.

　

###How many litecoin blocks give you similar security to bitcoin?

With the numbers so dramatically in litecoin's favor one would assume you'd need overall less time to verify a transaction with litecoin than you would with bitcoin.  Generally we have assumed it takes 4 litecoin blocks to equal the security of 1 bitcoin block but this has always been a guess.  Even the people who run the litecoin-project on github [know this isn't true](https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin/wiki/Comparison-between-Bitcoin-and-Litecoin) (see bullet #3 on *Faster transaction time*).  The problem again is the math not being a simple equation that you can easily solve for but [using that same calculator](http://www.pulcinientertainment.com/info/Streak-Calculator-enter.html) at the 50% threshold I've found that 8 litecoin blocks give you about the same security as 6 bitcoin blocks.

The nature of this problem is that it's not a linear relationship -- at 30%, 8 litecoin blocks are about twice as secure as 6 bitcoin blocks, but droping to 7 litecoin blocks and then to 6 very quickly tips things in bitcoin's favor.  The *only* scenareo where litecoin is less secure than bitcoin is when you compare the two networks block to block.  As a function of time litecoin is significantly more secure, so much so litecoin offers similar security at 20 minutes as bitcoin does at 60 minutes.",,False,self,t5_2szgd,False,,,True,t3_1cssqr,http://www.reddit.com/r/litecoin/comments/1cssqr/the_math_why_litecoin_is_more_secure_than_bitcoin/,

I just wanted to say thank you to the Litecoin community. We just had a very generous donation of Litecoin that will end up buying several hundred meals for Homeless people here in Pensacola, Fl. 

I'm new to Litecoin, for sure. But a few of your ranks have been really cool in talking to me about the community. I'm really impressed. I think I might have even been talked into starting to mine a bit. Feel free to give me noob pointers on getting that set up and optimized.

Anyway, I'm a huge believer in Cryptocurrency. I think it's a world changer. And I can tell you for sure, Litecoin is changing some peoples lives here in Pensacola. 

We are working on getting a permanent website up. I will definitely get some litecoin material up on it as well.

From the bottom of my heart. Thank you so much.

My current favorite is 21st Amendment. I can't get enough of it. So to subsidize my drinking (hehe) and to salvage what I consider to be beautiful packaging I set out on a DIY project to make a little extra money from the leftover packaging from my beer. The Earth gets lest waste, I get more beer, someone gets some nice stuff on the cheap - everybody wins. 

What goes great with beer? Beer coasters!

Why buy cheap, generic, plain looking plastic beer coasters when you can buy beer themed beer coasters? 

I've given/sold these to friends and at flea markets and it's always gone over very well. Now, I would like to offer these for sale for litecoin and see where it goes.

Excerpts:

Market Cap

With 333201 blocks mined, and 50 litecoins per block, there is currently 16,660,050 litecoins in circulation.  The current market price of $2 USD gives Litecoin a market cap of over $33 million.

This may sound like a lot, but considering that after the “crash” of the past couple of days, Bitcoin’s market cap about $1,157 million USD with the current market price of $98 USD.  If litecoin had the market cap of bitcoin, each litecoin would be worth over $69.  

Granted, this may not be a fair comparison, since in litecoin’s youth it has not experienced the same proportion of inflation as it’s older brother.  While bitcoin is already over its halfway mark to generating its limit of 21 million bitcoins, litecoin is much younger and has not reached the halfway point to its limit of 84 million litcoin.  If we factor in that there will be four times as many litecoins as bitcoins, each one of the 84 million litecoins would still be worth over $13 if litecoin had the bitcoin’s market cap.  


Litecoin Mining Difficulty

 A while back, my ears perked up at the prospects of litecoin because of a new technology is set to give the market a good shaking.  

As anticipated, the increase of difficulty of Bitcoin is causing traditional miners to look for more profitable outlets for their existing infrastructure.  Hundreds of ASIC miners are now active, which has forced up the difficulty dramatically to an all time high of 7,673,000 with the next difficulty estimated to be near 9,000,000.  News of the impending deployment of thousands more is forcing miners to rethink their allocation of existing infrastructure.  

Faced with bitcoin’s increasing mining difficulty, GPU Bitcoin miners have three options:

 Keep mining bitcoin at a potential loss as electricity costs become much greater than the return on mining.
Turn off their miners and sell or retire their hardware.  
Look for more profitable applications for their existing infrastructure, such as litecoin.  

This is where the power of litecoin is very apparent.  Due to it’s use of the memory intense scrypt algorithm, dedicated litecoin hardware like ASIC miners are not anticipated in the near future, giving GPU miners a window of opportunity for profit.  Switching their GPU hardware from bitcoin to litecoin is only a matter of installing a new mining application and can be done with little configuration.  The logical choice for most bitcoin miners will be to move their power to the litecoin network.  

In the short time I have been litecoin mining, I have seen the difficulty rise over 600%, meaning that there is six times more computing power dedicated to litecoin in only the past few months.   This indicates that many miners have already made the realization that bitcoin offers them a bleak future and made the switch to litecoin.  As these miners transition their hardware, litecoin’s mind share will increase, and it shouldn’t be a quickly passing event.  Miners can take confidence in litecoin knowing that their infrastructure will be valuable for the foreseeable future, and this confidence is bound to poor over into the market price of litecoin.  

As an early bitcoin miner, I remember the supply of ATI 5870’s graphic cards quickly becoming unavailable as individuals bought up supply for use in bitcoin mining.  This infrastructure still exists and it will not go to waste.

If we can start sparking some interest, and get some advertising, more people might take it seriously and Accept or Invest in to it.

---
* How would we want to market Litecoin, What advantages are there, If we only had 2 minutes to grab your attention about this what would it be.
* Work with someone(s) (Or the community) and write and edit a script.

People wise:

* A Voice-Over Actor
* A Graphic artist or designer (to either create assets or help with the overall style of the graphics)

If so, micro transactions of LTC are essential!


And here lies the problem, I issued two small transactions (1 LTC each) and was confronted with a fee of 0.1 on the second transaction.

Imagine this in everyday life. Go into a store, buy a coke for 0.1 LTC and the next coke which you get for a friend 10 minutes later is 0.1 + 0.1 in fees?

I'm just concerned that this will discourage users from adopting LTC for everyday casual use, and isn't this what we all want in the long run?

You would be *all over* that. Once MTGox officially confirms their support of LTC, the price is *guaranteed* to skyrocket based off speculation alone. 

Look at the price of BTC right now. Does anyone truly believe $235 is the true market value of a BTC? The BTC economy has seen little to no real changes in the past few months yet the price has shot up. Why? Because everyone is buying in. The MTGox queue is still over 10,000. Everyone is trying to get rich quick off of it. Many people are succeeding in doing so. 

The problem is, eventually everyone who wants to get in will have their coins and all at once realize ""Shit, nobody is actually spending these."" Most BTC investors are hoarding them. Understandably so too. Why would I buy BTC to buy something when I can buy twice as much with that same coin a week later? Yeah more and more vendors are accepting them but that doesn't mean they are being used. BTCs are most likely the future of currency but right now what you're seeing is not a true valuation.

The same exact thing is going to happen with Litecoins. Everyone who missed the BTC train is going to jump on this one instead. Why wait for the train to leave the station? There's a lot more room for the price to go up then down. As far as I'm concerned, it's a win-win at this point.

I'm trying to gauge interest in an ebay-like auction site that deals exclusively in LTC. I'm also considering the possibility of accepting BTC too, to appeal to a wider customer base. 

To do a good job of it, it'd take quite a bit of development time, and as such, I need to know if people feel it will be worth it or not.

I should point out that I am not looking for a get-rich-quick scheme, and I certainly won't be taking 10% of all fees and charging a listing fee. My plan is a mere 1.5-2% fee at point of sale only, and listings for free. No sale, no fee. 

I believe if we, as a community can get a site like this that is primarily dealing in LTC, it'd work wonders for it as a viable crypto-currency, and we'd all benefit from the value of these 'silver' coins rising.

Thoughts/advice/opinions?

1373462955.0,28,self.litecoin,1i07qw,"So, how about a realistic discussion of LTC -&gt; Gox?",39,11,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/litecoin/comments/1i07qw/so_how_about_a_realistic_discussion_of_ltc_gox/,"1. I'm seeing predictions upwards of $25/ltc which I find ludicrous. These predictions are usually based on the fact that LTC is mined 4x faster than thus 4x more abundant than BTC (~$100/4 = $25). Let's not forget that Litecoin is NOT Bitcoin. Total coins in circulation; 19,273,000 LTC and 11,380,000 BTC. The market cap for BTC is $880,000,000. Realistically, I expect LTC to capture 10-15% of BTC's market cap, at least short-term (maybe 1 month). This pegs the value of LTC at $4 to $6. A valuation of $25 is insane, and would indicate a market cap of $481,000,000. That said, I would be very happy with a sell of $4.50 on LTC.

2. I expect LTC sellers to react MUCH faster than buyers when LTC hits Gox. Sellers have been hoarding for month now, and are even equipped with SMS and email notifiers for LTC -&gt; Gox. Within minutes, huge sell orders will be going up on Gox, possibly driving the price down immediately upon release. There may be an excellent buy opportunity within the first ~12 hours of trading.

3. The introduction of LTC on Gox will provide liquidity between exchanges, notably Gox &lt;-&gt; BTC-E. If you're not interested in LTC, perhaps consider holding BTC on BTC-E throughout the transition period. The 5-7% spread between BTC-E and Gox will disappear, and you will be left with small and easy gains.

4. LTC might get pegged as BTC 2.0 if and when daily highs are made consecutively. We know all too well how quickly the media and community can become intoxicated by the prospect of making money. Remember how invincible everybody felt during the heydays of the BTC bubble? There's always a chance this will happen with LTC.

1365133186.0,28,self.litecoin,1bpml0,Litecoin 4x undervalued at $4?,40,12,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/litecoin/comments/1bpml0/litecoin_4x_undervalued_at_4/,"Some people are starting to worry that Litecoin is overvalued at $4 (it's been mostly between $4 - 4.50 for the last day now).  It is certainly a rapid rise from the ~$1 values we saw before news of MT.GOX supporting LTC broke out.  I'd like to share why I still see Litecoin as grossly undervalued.  I'll cover both the indicators I'm currently seeing and the general market trends I predict.

A lot of people think that awareness of LTC and what's happening with MT.GOX has already permeated the BTC community, such that the news is already ""priced in"" to the current value.  From what I'm monitoring, I don't believe this to be the case at all.

I haven't seen this considered as a metric for ""awareness"" before, but I think it is a great indicator:  The profitability of LTC mining (relative to BTC mining) has been consistently [over 300%](http://dustcoin.com/mining)  since Monday, even after a difficulty jump, and even above 600% briefly.  Even if people wanted to immediately convert their LTC to BTC, they could make 3 times as much mining LTC right now.  Instead, we've only seen modest growth in mining rates.  If awareness of LTC among the BTC community were as high as people have suggested, LTC mining profitability would be near parity with BTC.  I don't think that we should consider the news very well disseminated, and thus very well ""priced in"" until we see this happen.

Consider too all these factors when evaluating whether the MT.GOX news is ""priced in"":

* The only people trading now are those willing to deal with BTC-e.com.  Many refuse and say ""I'll wait for MT.GOX""

* The only people trading now are those who were already tuned into LTC enough to hear about MT.GOX being rumored to adopt LTC within a couple of days

* There are many BTC traders who haven't even heard of LTC and will learn about it only after they see it show up on MT.GOX.  

* Supposedly just the identity verification queue at MT.GOX is still over 25,000 people long. These are all new traders who heard about Bitcoin through mainstream media in just the last few weeks. These are all people who will likely buy into LTC too when it shows up on GOX.

Now another factor:  There are many people in the BTC community who fear other cryptocurrencies will hurt BTC.  As someone who held BTC since they were around $1, I had these concerns too.  When I saw LTC continue rising above other alternative chains I did a deep evaluation of it and [wrote about what I found, why I now like them, and why I think they'll help BTC and P2P cryptocurrency in general](http://www.reddit.com/r/litecoin/comments/1bbfdc/will_mining_litecoins_make_me_more_money_than/).  Now I've converted most of my BTC to LTC and am glad I did.  I think that it will take a lot of time for more people in the BTC community to follow down the road I did and stop considering LTC a threat, but that it will happen inevitably.

Along the trend of BTC supporting LTC, I think that all of the existing BTC services and merchants will begin accepting LTC soon.  It will be very easy for LTC to be integrated with services that already support BTC, so LTC will not have to wait for the long growth curve that BTC has gone through. With as much interest as LTC has gained recently, it will be in these companies' interest to also support LTC before a competitor takes that market.  BTC and LTC can gain mainstream acceptance and usability synchronously, instead of (as I've seen some people predict) LTC lagging behind BTC a couple of years.  I expect that services like BitPay will integrate Litecoin very soon and [hope that you write and ask them to](http://www.reddit.com/r/litecoin/comments/1bpdw8/ask_bitpay_to_support_litecoin_and_ask_every/).

So those are some general trends I see, but why do I specifically think that LTC is 4x under what it should be valued at right now?  Well,  let's consider the value of BTC before all of the mainstream news broke out and before ASICs started mining them.  BTC was around $13 at the start of the year.  This was just from natural growth without a speculation explosion, so I think we can consider that a fairly conservative value.  Now, consider that since ASICs weren't mining BTC at all at that time and that the network was secured only by GPUs. All of those GPUs will be moving almost entirely to LTC as acceptance of LTC grows in the BTC community and ASICs push GPUs out of BTC mining over the next six months.  So lets say that the $13 value is a conservative estimate of the value of a coin with a network of GPUs securing it the size of what we should soon expect to see securing LTC and with a stretch of services and available goods comparable to what we should soon see available for LTC.  You see what I'm getting at?

So let's say $13 is a conservative estimate of the value of LTC right now.  If we add in the fact that we didn't know more widespread acceptance of BTC was coming when BTC was valued there, I could VERY conservatively estimate that should add about 50% to the value and get around $20 per LTC.  Let's be more conservative and say it adds 25%, so that would make a single Litecoin worth $16 right now.

Now consider that after MT.GOX supports LTC and news really breaks out about it, that should be an opportunity for the mainstream media to start picking up stories talking about how there are now two P2P cryptocurrencies trading, each with values of individual coins greater than that of USD, Euro, and GBP combined.  Not only will that raise awareness of and interest in LTC, but also many people who might have initially brushed off Bitcoins as a fad will start to think ""maybe there's really something to this.""  So both BTC and LTC would benefit and more people would convert their national currencies to BTC and LTC.  If I'm conservative about the effect this could have by the end of the year, I'd say that could easily double the value of both.  That would make for a $32 Litecoin.

So yes, I think LTC are 4x undervalued at $4 right now.  Please let me know why you might think otherwise and share any novel indicators you have.",,False,self,t5_2szgd,1365134573.0,,,True,t3_1bpml0,http://www.reddit.com/r/litecoin/comments/1bpml0/litecoin_4x_undervalued_at_4/,

We need a Litecointip Bot, I am currently working on one, if anybody has any skills to contribute you can pm me.

Spread the word across sub-reddits, Look at what /r/bitcoin is doing, all the users have formed a circle working together to get merchants to accept bitcoin, to get more people to invest, to mine etc.

We haven't even reached full potential yet, just getting started. 

user /u/casualredditreader gave his idea [over here](http://www.reddit.com/r/litecoin/comments/19obj6/litecoin_prbegins_lets_do_this_day_1_05032013/c93pv2v) i quote:

&gt; * I think that it would be good to get together a list of companies and write to them about litecoin support (I've already asked namecheap and Valve). But, what about others?

 &gt;* I think Litecoin needs the most is businesses. Litecoin PR team should collect a small purse and use it as a reward. Sort of like how cities use development funds to improve things. Collect a pot of like 10,000 LTC and offer it as rewards, incentives, assistance to people trying to implement LTC in their online store. ""Will you accept LTC? No! Would you do it if I offered you $20? OK.""

 &gt;* Litecoin needs better graphics. I tried finding a Litecoin logo in SVG the other day and couldn't find anything. 

 &gt;* Documentation and help (someone owns litecoinwiki.com but, it's sitting on parked page). We need people to understand where to get Litecoin and how to mine it and spend it.

&gt; * Write to the other exchanges and ask them to support LTC. If it's a minor tweak, and it makes them money what do they care? They make money on every transaction. I asked Mt. Gox to set up a Litecoin Exchange.

&gt; * Someone should set up a a Litecoin Foundation similar to the [Bitcoin Foundation](https://bitcoinfoundation.org)

&gt; * Someone should set up a legit auction site (like bitmit.net) for Litecoin auctions. Atlantis is nice and probably helps with PR but, lots of people want to buy legal stuff. Most people aren't going to use TOR.


 I may sound a little too enthusiastic but this is what is needed :)

Original Submission: http://redd.it/1c7kfu

Last night about 2 hours after MtGox came back online (the first time) I was happily trading away as I have been all week when I was suddenly logged out of my account. Upon trying to login again I was told my password was incorrect. After being blocked twice due to incorrect login attempts I tried the password retrieval system, which did not recognize my email address used to create the account, but did still recognize my username. It has now been over 13 hours since I emailed support, and I have yet to receive a response. Looking at Bitcointalk and other forums, this appears to be the beginnings of a widespread problem! https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=173354.0

And before someone asks, No I did not use a simply stupid passphrase, and No I did not click any links from the trollbox.

1365794076.0,23,self.litecoin,1c83c2,How are people still mining at notroll.in?,27,4,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/litecoin/comments/1c83c2/how_are_people_still_mining_at_notrollin/,"Some of you probably already know about the shadiness that went down at notroll.in a few days ago. If not, I’ll try to summarize the facts:

- A few days ago, miners using notroll.in were accidentally paid double what they were entitled to for a 14 hour period.

- The pool operator realized his mistake, and immediately took 25-33% out of everyone's total LTC balance, regardless of whether or not they were actually mining during the double-payment period. Also regardless of what their current balance was.

- People start to realize that litecoins are missing from their pool accounts, and post on bitcointalk.org asking what's up (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=92716.520). No information about the incident is posted to notroll.in at all (and still isn't).

- Pool operator shows up on bitcointalk.org and tells everyone (in a less-than-""diplomatic"" fashion) that it's their fault that he took their money, because nobody told him they were being double paid. Essentially says that it's too much work to figure out who was actually double-paid and by how much, so he just took money from everyone, and to deal with it.

- Another thread with more info here:  https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=172667.0


I had already stopped mining at notroll.in a couple days before the incident, because for the past week or so I had only been making about half of the litecoins per day that I expected to, given my hashrate (due to site downtime, high stales/rejects, and share simply disappearing with no record). If I had been mining during the double-payment period, I probably would have just assumed that the pool was working properly for the first time in over a week - not that I was being overpaid.


My girlfriend stopped mining at notroll.in as well, but she wasn't able to withdraw her balance because of a site bug. She logged in a couple days later to try again, and saw that 1/3 of her total litecoin balance was missing. This amounted to a couple weeks worth of mining for her. And she wasn't even mining in the pool during the double-payment period.


Several people at bitcointalk.org are claiming losses of hundreds of litecoins representing weeks of mining because of this. Yes, these people should probably be cashing out frequently instead of letting a small fortune amass under somebody else's control, but that isn't the point of this (although it's certainly a lesson to take away).


It doesn't look like notroll.in's total hashrate has changed at all because of this - it's still one of the largest pools, with plenty of people still merrily mining away there. I suspect that a bunch of people didn't notice that the pool operator took some of their litecoins; it'd be easy to miss if you cashout often and/or maintain a low balance. I more strongly suspect that most people don't realize HOW the operator went about making this ""correction"" - with a simple ~30% flat tax on everyone's total balance, regardless of how much money that might actually represent, or whether they were even mining at all during the double-payment window. All of this was done with zero communication on his site, and followed with accusations that everyone in his pool is a cheater, and lucky he didn't take more, or simply shut his pool down and take everything (seriously, read his comments in the bitcointalk.org threads that I linked).

HELP!!!,29,7,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/litecoin/comments/1f2kpn/i_have_created_a_monster_help/,"Over the past month I have rented a VPS to use for my small Litecoin P2Pool. After launching it and making sure it worked, I started posting it in my sig and trying to get people to mine on my P2Pool. 

Two days ago, I started experiencing a DDoS attack and some severe latency. Come Friday, I received a notice from my VPS provider that they have received an abuse email and that my server was being used for a botnet command and control center that was being used to DDoS mtgox! 

Once the VPS was unsuspended, I searched the VPS for a few hours and I wasn't able to find anything. I explained what was going on to the provider and he okay'ed it. Then, about an hour ago, I received another email that was coming from my domain/server and it was sending out emails with a file called 'invoice2812.pdf.exe' that would connect to my domain on port 9327 and ""Begins sending obsfucated messages back and forth with the server, while maintaining 100% CPU usage.""

Since this has happened, I moved my server to a Linux based server running very minimal services [SSH, litecoind, and p2pool] to make sure it was not the server that was infected and sending such emails/malware.

I am in NO WAY looking to use my mining pool for such things. I was just hoping to start a small pool without any real issues. If someone else is using my pool to mine using these infected machines, how do I get it to stop? Is there anything that I can do?


EDIT: I should add some corrections here. The server that I own and pool that I run was not compromised. The email is stating that p2pool is acting as a command and control center for a botnet that is being used to mine litecoins. It appears that the botnet is spreading via email and also DDoSing mtgox. While I could setup iptables to block connections, there is no way for me to constantly block everyone coming in to mine, that would just be a pain in the ass. My p2pool is running on port 9327 [as most do] and I do know how to block individual IPs, but how can I see if a miner is a compromised machine before allowing it to mine at my pool? Especially when there are massive amounts of them coming in and mining under different LTC addresses.

EDIT #2: No one has access to the server.
Someone is spreading a .exe file via email.
That .exe is then connecting to my mining pool.
That .exe is then sending itself to all the contacts in the infected persons email client to spread.

Due to this, my p2pool looks like a CnC server to people who do not understand litecoin mining.

Here is a copy of one of the abuse emails for further clarification: 

""Inside the zip file, there is a single file called 'invoice2812.pdf.exe' which
when executed:
1. Resolves the domain 'mydomainremoved.com'
2. Creates an outbound connection to 'mydomainremoved.com' / 'my.ip.address.here' on port 9327
3. Begins sending obsfucated messages back and forth with the server, while maintaining 100% CPU usage

We have begun filtering mail from my.ip.address.here/24 as a precaution across
1&amp;1/Mail.com/GMX.com. Although this appears to be a very small network abuse
issue (we've only seen emails / callbacks to/from the IP my.ip.address.here), we are
concerned as we do not have the capabilities to remove previously delivered 
copies of this message.

We would greatly appreciate your response as to the status of this issue. We
would appreciate a notification once the issue has been mitigated, so that we
may remove the block, otherwise it will expire automatically in 14 days.""

Been into bitcoins for the last couple of years and I've just made the switch to litecoins on my GPU miners. Love the promise of a bitcoin-like currency with faster confirms for transactions so I'd like to do what I can to help out the budding litecoin economy. We handmake minimalistic leather belts and wallets in Canada and I'm contemplating the addition of litecoins as a payment method as an experiment of sorts. I've looked into BitPay for accepting bitcoins, but can't find anything quite equivalent for litecoins.

What I'm looking for is functionality for our new website that'll enable a ""pay with litecoins"" functionality.

I'd like the process to be as automated as possible given the fluctuating value of litecoins; I feel like any value swings between invoicing and payment are either bad for the customer or for my business.

The dev has posted here once before, but I feel like this needed some more exposure while there's still time to fund the campaign.       
[18 days left]

Part of the funding would cover a VPS instance to host the electrum server, which I believe would help all electrum LTC users, android or otherwise

Litecoin support is listed as a 3 BTC stretch goal, there's no reason we couldn't help get this done - plus the dev will make arrangements for LTC payments

&gt;Litecoin Support - 3 BTC
&gt;
&gt;Supporting Litecoin would be a great feature to offer a common location for Bitcoin and Litecoin management. &gt;This feature would specifically entail the following:
&gt;
&gt;--Multiple address formats designed in
&gt;
&gt;--Additional wallet types to encompass LTC addresses and derived Electrum &amp; BIP 32 chains
&gt; 
&gt;--Handle multiple SPV types - one with SHAd256 and one with SCRYPT
 &gt;
&gt;--Connecting to multiple backends simultaneously to collect data for each address space
&gt;
&gt;--Construct a useful user interface where summaries of both coin types are effectively communicated
&gt;
&gt;--Work with individuals offering to serve up Electrum Litecoin nodes to get setup with the latest working code
&gt;
&gt;There is quite a bit of work to get this working smoothly, however since this is a ground-up design, such &gt;difficulties can be designed out. As for Electrum Litecoin nodes, I expect that after some periods of time reliably &gt;hosting a node, portions of the proceeds for this stretch goal will go towards a donation to the node maintainer. &gt;An example schedule could be: 0.06 BTC for every month of reliable operation up to a year. Beyond that, I hope &gt;other donations can sustain the node maintainers. The value would depend on the time required to implement &gt;this feature.

Litecoin is becoming a very strong contender to Bitcoin [1]. It will soon be on Mtgox, according to their press reports. Feathercoin has also picked up steam, and it's interesting because it's brand new and already popular. Namecoin, which has been around since 2011, is still a strong contender with long term potential and value. The main difference between Litecoin and Bitcoin is the hashing algorithm used. Litecoin also has faster transaction confirmation times, since blocks are mined at a 4x rate. In my best opinion, Litecoin is better technology than Bitcoin.

Anyways it is a worthwhile thing to look into these before the mainstream gets to them. There are two main exchanges to trade alternative cryptocurrencies, here [2] and here [3]. Also there is a forum where they are discussed and you can monitor the hype [4].

At the time of this post, LTC are trading for $1.67 each. Currently, the easiest way to get them is by converting USD -&gt; BTC and then BTC -&gt; LTC. In other words, it's not that easy and most people don't want to be bothered with that.

As soon as LTC go live on MTGox, the market will be accessible to tens of thousands of customers who may not have ever previously considered purchasing LTC, including the 28,000 accounts currently in queue to be verified. 

At $1.67, all LTC has to do is go to $3.34 and your investment has been doubled. Do you really think after what we saw happen to BTC though that it will stop there? 

LTC has the same potential of getting pumped that BTC had. The key is not to be greedy. Choose a magic number right now and sell at it.

""Bitpay processes payments using the most secure payment network, Bitcoin. We have no plans to use any other payment network. We are often asked whether we will accept Visa, MasterCard, PayPal and even alternative digital currencies. These forms of payment are more vulnerable to various kinds of payment fraud and hence BitPay will not support them. Users can however convert various other kinds of assets into Bitcoin using the many Bitcoin exchanges that are available and then use those Bitcoins for purchases.""

So, in their view Litecoin is on the same bucket as VISA and Mastercard, hence ""more vulnerable to various kinds of payment fraud"". Down vote for BitPay!

Dear all,
Today we scheduled a maintenance that went bad on Hypernova.
The purpose of this maintenance was to push the new litecoin daemon in its new version 0.8.3.7.
As you may be aware, this new branch of litecoin needs to resync the whole blockchain.
During the blockchain syncing, the network difficulty dropped to something like 0.XXXX and the PPS rate skyrocketed.
Those who were mining during that upgrade within that 2 minutes timeframe experienced a WAY too high balance (we're talking about thousands of LTCs)
The auto withdraw threshold feature perfectly worked. Here is how you empty a pool wallet in seconds.
I'm very sorry about your loss. I decide to stop the Hypernova's adventures here.
If the coins (or part of the coins) are returned by those who received the withdraws, I'll be happy to refund those who ask me in PM or at feedback@hypernova.pw (please tag your subject with [refund] as you guess I'll have many mails within the next days)

If you see that Hypernova sent you too many coins, could you please send them back to LgDKkDSmjCmgEwkNZH5TXSnhd2aKbDFzzr so there will be less people screwed ?
Thanks for mining on our pool and sorry again.. Human mistake.

This is due to a cruel bout of [dust spam](http://litecoinscout.com/block/67ed15a13c4e03244d69981a420672105b72b555827b98f20b6c89d45dcb6fa5) that occurred early in Litecoin's life. 

If you want to reduce fees, your best bet is to try [Litecoin Wallet for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.schildbach.wallet.litecoin). It will let you go with fees of 0 or 0.0005. I would personally trust it with only $50 worth of LTC so maybe you can just use that to consolidate p2pool and other small transactions to send to your desktop client.

In regards to litecoin-qt, a new version *is* being worked on now that will be based on the 0.8.1 Bitcoin code. No ETA currently but know that it's being worked on. If you're interested in testing come to #litecoin-dev on freenode IRC chat.

LTC is growing popular, really popular but we need some of the community to focus on what is important here.

If this growth continues to grow it might turn into a Bubble, we need more services which power the economy of ltc.

If you want to catch up with the gold rush you should know that There is plenty of room for many LTC based Businesses, 

You can open an exchange, a mining pool, open a payment processor, open clones that are listed on https://www.spendbitcoins.com/places/ but based on litecoin! 

Forget about just buying some LTC and expecting the currency to grow like this for much longer, 

If most of us do this LTC's value will deteriorate, it will be just another crypto currency which didn't make it!

It's based (as you'll probably see later) on the equivalent guide I wrote and posted in /r/bitcoin. You can use the same system for Litecoins and Bitcoins.

I believe if you run your litecoin client on a dedicated secure OS (a small Linux distro that you don't use for anything else), back your wallet up often and use strong encryption, it's virtually impossible to lose your coins. For a more in-depth explanation, see the [rationale for the original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1jd3wi/guide_how_to_make_a_secure_yet_practical_wallet/cbdgwl6).

----

### STEP 1: the operating system

To install Lubuntu, follow the instructions in one of these links:

- [Install to a USB drive](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1jd3wi/guide_how_to_make_a_secure_yet_practical_wallet/cbdgwyg)
    or
- [Install to your disk](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1jd3wi/guide_how_to_make_a_secure_yet_practical_wallet/cbdgy36)

Installing to USB is more secure because if someone takes control of your primary OS, they won't be able to infect Lubuntu with malware. However I don't think that's very likely to happen, unless someone is specifically targeting you, so feel free to install to your hard disk if you want.  
Remember that you need less than 8 GB of space (Lubuntu takes 4.5 GB, Litecoin takes 2, you can also install Electrum for bitcoins which takes less than 0.1), but if you can, leave more just in case. Resizing partitions can be a PITA.


### STEP 2: the client

Unfortunately we don't have the equivalent of Armory or Electrum for litecoin yet, so you have to use Litecoin-Qt. This means regular backups after sending transactions. Oh well.

0. Download Litecoin-Qt for GNU/Linux from https://litecoin.org/. Make sure the download page is secure (https://).
0. Open the file (you may need to open your Downloads folder and double click it there). There should be a folder inside named ""litecoin-0.x.x.x-linux"", where 0.x.x.x is the version number. Extract it to your home folder and rename it ""litecoin-linux"" (so you don't have to change paths every time you upgrade it).
0. Right click your desktop, ""Create new"" -&gt; ""Shortcut"". Enter ""litecoin"" as the name (it doesn't really matter, that's just the name of the file where the actual name to be shown on screen is stored, stupid I know).
0. On the next screen, select ""Browse"" and select the file `[home]/litecoin-linux/bin/[32 or 64 depending on what version of Lubuntu you are running]/litecoin-qt`. Enter ""Litecoin"" as name. Click on ""Change Icon"", ""Choose icon from: Image Files"", then find the litecoin icon in `litecoin-linux/src/share/pixmaps/bitcoin256.png`.
0. Close the dialog and launch Litecoin by double clicking your new icon. Select Settings -&gt; Encrypt Wallet, and enter a secure passphrase.

    Since keys can be bruteforced easily, it should be at least 10 characters, and not based on a dictionary word or pattern (like ""tr0ub4d0r&amp;!"" or ""qwert1YQWERTy""). It shouldn't be a password you have used for a website either. I strongly suggest creating a 5-word passphrase with either of these generators: [[1]](https://entima.net/diceware/), [[2]](http://www.fourmilab.ch/javascrypt/pass_phrase.html). Litecoin says ""eight or more words"" but that's completely crazy.
0. Restart Litecoin. Click on File, Backup Wallet, and save the file somewhere. This file is very important, **if you lose it you will lose your litecoins** (you can't make a paper or brain wallet). Due to change addresses, you have to backup your wallet regularly after sending coins. Litecoin-Qt keeps a pool of 100 addresses, so you should only lose your coins if you make 100 transactions without backing up, but it's safer to do it after every time.

    I recommend using a directory that gets automatically backed up (for example, the Dropbox folder). Just right click it in the file browser and select ""add to bookmarks"" for easier access. Remember to copy it to other places too (thumb drives, cloud services).
0. That's it! If you already have litecoins somewhere else, test the system by sending a small amount (0.1 LTC) and making sure it works, then you can transfer the rest.

    
    


To keep this system secure, remember to follow these rules:

- Launch this system only to send or receive litecoins. Avoid installing other software or messing with configuration files. If you just want to test something on Linux, use the LiveCD.
- NEVER leave your computer alone near untrusted people with your wallet open. At least close litecoin.
- Install system updates as soon as you get prompted.
- Keep litecoin updated. It will probably warn you when there's a new version.

**Background:**

I was looking for a small ticker that would show LTC prices in BTC for Chrome, but there were none, so I built one. Then I followed with an equivalent for PPC (more on why separated extensions later) and eventually I figured it would be perfect if it had a notifications system built in so I could finally stop constantly looking at charts. At which point well, it made sense to make another one for BTC. 

**What:**

Three Chrome extensions, for BTC, LTC and PPC, with the following features:

* Shows current exchange rate on its icon, updates every minute, click forces update. 

* Supports BTC and USD exchange rates for LTC and PPC, USD only for BTC

* Alert notifications, can notify you of price changes with a customizable threshold. Instead of specifying a ""max"" and ""min"" you want to be alerted about, which is a pain to maintain because with the current price volatility you have to change it every day, or setting up several rules, which, well, ain't nobody got time for that, these extensions take one single threshold. If the price goes up or down this value, you'll get a notification, i.e., if you set it to 10 USD and the current BTC price is 135 USD, you'd get notified if the price goes below 125, below 115, or above 145, 155, etc. This works pretty well for a fire and forget system and can be customized to your liking: a lower threshold will show notifications more frequently, and a higher one will reduce the volume. I'm obviously biased, but I've been testing it for a couple days and I really love what I came up with, see if it works for you aswell.

* Alerts work even if you hide the extensions, which is perfect if you don't want to be constantly reminded of the price but still be alerted when there's a major price change (this is how I currently use them: you can right click the icon, select ""Hide button"" and the extension will be hidden but remain active)

* Alerts have memory: go offline or hibernate, and as long as you leave Chrome open when you come back you'll be notified about the difference since the extension last checked prices.

* Doesn't require signup and doesn't ask you for your email address or any other data for that matter unlike other web services dedicated to alerts.


So without further ado:

* [Tiny BTC Ticker](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tiny-btc-ticker/phegclbgebimkcbmddleefnbnphckgeb)

* [Tiny LTC Ticker](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tiny-ltc-ticker/bdaippkmonkpdmjgabfmheecfgcfpaec)

* [Tiny PPC Ticker](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tiny-ppc-ticker/nknlbflgcifnoipobbndhhjilbailplh)


**Why:**

I built them mainly for myself out of necessity, and because other tickers I tried IMHO sucked. I figured others could use it as well. It won't change the world, and it won't predict the next bubble, but it does the job for me at least.

**FAQ** 

(Aka questions that nobody actually asked yet, but that I'm labeling as frequently asked questions anyway because that's what people do on the internets):

**PERMISSIONS. Holy shit dude, your extension requests my data on btc-e, mtgox and vircurex. Are you insane? What are you, a troll from btc-e?**

I tried to explain it a bit in the extension page but I'll give it a go here aswell. Chrome permission system is a bit strict: there's no granularity. In order for the extension to be able to fire a request to say https://data.mtgox.com/api/2/BTCUSD/money/ticker I have to request permission to mtgox.com. But even if the extension requests permission only to ""https://data.mtgox.com/api/*"" which would only give it access to the API, Chrome still labels it as ""your data on mtgox.com"". It's been discussed on the net multiple times before, [here's a link](http://lifehacker.com/5990769/why-do-chrome-extensions-need-to-access-all-my-data) to a recent article on it. I have yet to upload these extensions to Github, which I will, but in the meantime you can review the extact content of the extensions, with original code indentation and comments and all (it's not minified or obfuscated), by pulling it directly from the chrome web store as a zip file. [Here's](http://www.labnol.org/software/view-source-of-chrome-extension/21284/) how to do it. I'm suggesting this just so anyone can already review the code today before it's up on Github, it's basically a very simple script in JS with no backend or external communication other than the exchanges and the extension.

**Does the extension talk with a backend/server of yours?**

Nope, no backends, just client code that runs on your pc and fetches data directly from the exchanges. See previous question.

**Wait, why 3 extensions? Can you not, like, support any cryptocurrency within a single extension?**

In Chrome each extension only gets one icon, hence, if you want to have one icon per cryptocurrency, you'll need one extension for each. This is the main reason why I chose to do one extension per currency.

**Where do you get the data from?**

Currently this is set as follows:

* BTC to USD: mtgox.com

* LTC to BTC: btc-e.com

* LTC to USD: btc-e.com

* PPC to BTC: btc-e.com

* PPC to USD: vircurex.com


This can't be changed at the moment but I may add more data ""providers"" later on.

**The tickers price lags a bit, isn't it being updated every second?**

I'm inclined to believe exchange services, specially mtgox, are slow updating their APIs for some reason and lag a couple minutes or so. Either that or Chrome is ocasionally caching things, I'll look into it further but so far it hasn't been a tremendous problem, it's definitively not an issue for alerts/notifications.

**Can you add SMS notifications?**

Nope, this extension works within chrome and I'd need to setup a backend for it for starters. But if you have a smartphone there's almost guaranteed an app for this, so I'd encourage you to search for one.

**Can you implement XYZ?**

Sure, ask and if there's demand and I have the time I'll give it a go.

**Can you build a Tiny Ticker for {insert cryptocurrency here}?**

Sure, again, ask and if there's demand I'll make it happen.

**I found a typo! You can't words!**

Easy, I'm not a native english speaker :) feel free to report it if it's hurting your eyes, I'm not a big fan of typos myself either.

**What color is your underwear?**

Usually white, sometimes blue if I'm feeling enthusiastic.

I was wondering if anyone else is having these issues, and if they have had these issues and got them resolved how they did that.

Until recently I was able to add and withdraw funds from my BTC-E account easily, and had done so many times before. However now when I press the ""Withdraw Money"" button on any currency or coin, I get the following error message at the bottom of the page:

[""Denied for your account. Contact support.""](http://i.imgur.com/B1EX7BE.png)

I've attached a screenshot here:

http://i.imgur.com/B1EX7BE.png

Needless to say I wont be adding any more funds to BTC-E until I know the issue is resolved, **and I advise others to be extremely careful with BTC-E**. I've contacted support 8 times now, and have been having the issue for over 1 week. Each time they simply ask me stupid questions back, which they already know the answers to. Such as my username, or where I purchased my BTC-E codes from to initially fund my account, which was many months ago and from a friend (my balance is now over 10 times that anyway).

To be honest I didn't even want to withdraw funds, I just wanted to know which options were available and I'm glad I checked. It seems highly suspicious to me that they started to have this issue magically after getting hacked, and I wonder if they have a liquidity crisis. It also seems that there's up to 50 other people on the site who also have the same issue.

1365798691.0,14,self.litecoin,1c89l6,"My budget, british LTC mining rig.",15,1,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/litecoin/comments/1c89l6/my_budget_british_ltc_mining_rig/,"Hey all,

I'm new to the world of BitCoin and LiteCoin mining, and I'm really excited about the whole thing, it presses all my geekbuttons, even though I don't see a massive profit to be made just yet.

I'd like to share with you my ""budget"" rig; I've seen some rigs that are very expensive, and some which almost don't seem cost effective. To me, this was the right tradeoff between price and KH/s. 

**This setup is giving me an average of 630KH/s in total**

1) Annotated picture of my rig **[HERE](http://imgur.com/BHjYNZG)**

2) If you'd prefer a video walk-through, it's **[HERE](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwD94LZF_lg)** *(although be warned I pretty much ramble like british rambling moron)*

Aaaand the full spec of my machine as follows:

* Gigabyte GA-Z77-DS3H Socket 1155 VGA DVI HDMI 7.1 Channel Audio ATX Motherboard @ £57.44
* Intel Celeron G540 2.50GHz Socket 1155 2MB L3 Cache Retail Boxed Processor @ £27.49
* 2x PowerColor HD 6870 PCS+ 1GB GDDR5 Dual DVI Dual Mini DisplayPort HDMI PCI-E Graphics Card @ £183.30
* Kingston 4GB 1600MHz DDR3 Non-ECC CL11 DIMM SR x8 @ £19.99
* Be Quiet Pure Power L7 630W PSU @ £55.82

* **VAT** @ 20% = £412.84 plus delivery.

The case and the hard drive are what I found lying around in my place of work, a PC repair shop. I've seen some really clever cases, but to be honest for this kind of rig at this power, I don't deem it necessary at all. I just took the sides &amp; top off an old case I found, so everything was nicely exposed and open.

For cooling, again I rummaged through the bits and bobs lying around at work, and found an 80mm and a 120mm fan. I mounted these both passing air past and over the cards, and I've not really pushed anything over about 70 degrees C - the fans on these particular cards blow air onto the heatsink, which then dissipates around the cards, so passing air over and through seems to be the best way to remove heat, lastly it's in an inherently cold room that nobody ever goes in (around 6 or 7 celcius all the time) tucked away in a corner.

**A word of advice about the PSU** - If you're thinking of scrimping on a cheap PSU, *please don't.* I purchased a generic 750W PSU for £14, had only one PCI-E 6pin power plug on it, daisychained 3 more PCI-E plugs from a single molex and the PSU sparked and went out with an almighty bang within about 3 minutes flat. Whatever GPU card(s) you buy, AMD has a list of reccomended PSU's that will work with them. Use one of those.

All of my gear was purchased from eBuyer online, I know I work at a PC repair shop, but my boss said I wasn't allowed to use our suppliers, at trade price, for personal use (gutted!).

**SOFTWARE**:
I'm running W7HP with all the performance settings switched on, and using CGMiner as part of a pool. I've added some stuff in like scheduled tasks to backup my Wallet.dat files daily to a dropbox account, auto-running of my CGMiner BAT file on system start, a Powershell script that emails me to let me know if my system has rebooted itself, and one that emails me total system uptime every 2 hours. This basically means I don't have to keep checking on it as often, because if something goes wrong, I won't get any emails, or if the machine reboots unexpectedly, I'll be notified.

I've got a dedicated VPN pointing right at it, and it's running UltraVNC for management, so I can literally log on anywhere, from my laptop at home, or from my Android phone where-ever I am.

Any more info just ask - Happy mining :)

However, every person who is firing off cannot provide any source to back up why litecoin is a scam or will fail, only opinion from what I have seen. The most common used seems to be its a ponzi scheme, but from what I can tell, if that is the case, then so is BTC (even more so when comparing the value of BTC compared to LTC). I found [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geWUr8cNwXQ) in the same thread, which highlights this quite well 

I also [read the thread](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=153460.0) earlier on bitcontalk.org where someone offers to pay people to attack the litecoin network? Stranger still is the moderators have not even deleted or locked the thread? What sort of message is that giving out?

Myself, I am quite new to this tech / currency. I own 3 BTC and 110 LTC, so I have no real dog in this race so far, but it just leaves me even more interested in LTC now. I can't help summarising that if *some* of the BTC community feel so threatened by LTC to the point that they are prepared to pay for a 51% attack, then there must be something in LTC!?!

So why is this? Is it to do with a few personalitys and resentments that have been around a while (I know most communities have there dramas) or is it that LTC is seen as a real threat? Perhaps they don't want others to invest in another, and would prefer all to be invested into BTC?

Sure, the idea of a virtual currency that is not controlled by a country is a truely pioneering feat, yet the prospect of pure anonymity is what drew in so many interested, prospective buyers. Never before in the history of the drug trade, could somebody sell and buy illegal substances with 99.99% anonymity. Yes, the Silk Road stirs controversy simply by its nature, yet undoubtedly, the Silk Road is an innovative, trailblazing phenomenon to those advocates who use it, and atleast intrigues those who don't use it. The bottom line is that it got attention. Alot of attention. Ironically, mainstream media probably advertised this illegal website better and helped add more users than any other medium. And every news article, 60 second television bit, or online forum that mentioned Silk Road also mentioned Bitcoin. They grew together. 

I am going to cut this short and get to the point. The reason I am writing this, is that I am an advocate for Litecoin. If Litecoin were to be accepted on the Silk Road, it would do wonders for the confidence of the consumers in this virtual currency (ironically). What can we do to get Litecoin as an accepted currency on Silk Road? Any ideas? I think a petition would be nice, but it would have to be organized, well worded, and properly publicized. We only get a few chances at this, and I would like to do it right! Any ideas?


P.S. If and when Mt Gox adds litecoin, this will help the currency immensely, but there's things we can do as a Litecoin community to help this currency gain footing!

That went great and we expect Litecoins to be traded there soon.  I've asked you to ask BitPay to support Litecoins and they've told us they're willing to when the mining level increases enough that they trust the network (it will be soon!  Bitcoin gpu miners will be coming to Litecoins in droves as ASICs make the Bitcoin mining game unfair for them).  They also said that even before that they will definitely be enabling all merchants using their service to accept Litecoins (by converting them to Bitcoins at the point of sale). This community outreach is very successful so far and is what will bring LTC into the forefront.

If all of us can contact a new service every day telling them about why we like Litecoins and why we'd love it if they accepted them or supported them, Litecoins can grow without bounds.

Now is the time to get major Bitcoin accepting merchants to start also accepting Litecoins; Litecoins should be accepted wherever Bitcoins are.  We should be particularly targeting merchants which already accept Bitcoins because they will be the easiest to convince of the value and will already have the infrastructure in place to make it easy to accept Litecoins.

Please email your favorite merchants to ask if they'll accept Litecoins.  Here's a couple of lists of Bitcoin-accepting merchants: 

* https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Trade
* https://www.spendbitcoins.com/places/

Also email anyone you'd like to buy from every time you want to buy something online and ask if they will accept Litecoins for what you want.

Here is an email you can adapt:

*Hi,*

*I want to buy stuff from you with Litecoins and hope that you will support them.  They are similar to Bitcoins, but have advantages.  Here is a good summary of why I like them: http://redd.it/1bbfdc  In particular, they provide faster confirmations for transactions and are thus more practical for e-commerce.*

*Litecoins are currently worth about $4/each, have a market cap of approximately 1/20th that of Bitcoin, and are still rapidly growing.  I think that Litecoins are still undervalued relative to Bitcoins, so if you are interested in Bitcoin as a still-deflationary currency I think you will be even more interested in Litecoins.*

*Please let me know when you plan to provide for this.*

*Respectfully,*

*me*

I'd like some feedback from you guys.

I currently have a private farm that hashes nearly twice what ciphermine is doing for scrypt. I also have at least three times their ASIC preorders preordered.
I'm not publicly traded.

CipherMine is valued at nearly 1.7million USD. Is this as ridiculous as it seems? I've read all of their company info, and I've seen the photos/screenshots on their site.

Even if they are located in a UK datacentre, with at-cost electricity, they'll still be paying nearly 4x as much as i am for power.

I don't get it. Is their market cap being pumped up by idiot investors? Is their valuation realistic?

If i were willing to go public with my operation, which is at least twice as large as CipherMine, do you think I could reach a $3+million USD mcap? Or would i have to be a blonde chick?

We know Litecoin offers three main benefits, compared to Bitcoin:

&gt; Faster processing

&gt; More coins


Benefiting:

&gt; Traders and consumers: Faster processing seems the biggest benefit.
_(Aside: I wonder if BTC will ever improve on itself in this regard?)_

&gt; Miners: Scrypt

&gt; ???: More coins


We want people to adopt, mine and trade in LTC in order for it to become more successful. But we also need it to be more useful in a world that already knows about BTC.

Besides transaction speed, as a consumer, why should you pay with LTC rather than BTC? Better/easier payment processors/tools? Is it the crypto&lt;&gt;classical gap that we need to bridge, at some point?

If LTC was to be the silver of Bitcoin, should it feel more related? Do we really have a close idea of where LTC is going and it's relationship to BTC? Is the fact that BTC is somewhat tainted with the 'unlawful' brush by the media (SR), something we need to avoid? Do we care about integrating with _typical_ economy?

In these early days, in a landscape different than Bitcoin's, are we doing enough to drive Litecoin? Do we have a plan?

Determine how much cash you want to put into it and fill out all the information (Max $500 in cash per day). You will have to go to the nearest CVS/Walmart/etc with moneygram in order to make the deposit. It isn't hard, you just gotta follow the directions they give you.


&gt;3.) After you make the deposit at CVS/Walmart/moneygram, you'll get an email with your VouchX code. Log into your vircurex accout. Click on the upper left of the website where it says ""Accounts"", click on deposit with VouchX, and enter your VouchX code. You now have USD in your account.


&gt;4.) On the upper right of the website click on ""Settings"", then ""Layout"", uncheck ""Show only BTC rates"" and hit save. Click on orders to get to the exchange area, and on the right scroll down to LTC/USD and click on it. You can place a bid to buy LTC at a certain amount and wait for someone to fill your order, or you can click one of the sell orders to enter the information into the box above, then hit Buy and it should occur instantly. Make sure to click ""release"" on your order for it to go through.

I would love if you give me a second to explain my situation, and thanks to who is reading this.
Im from Venezuela (Little country, central american, beautiful women, corrupt/clowns politicians) and been living here since birth. Im studying ""Computational Engineering"" right now, and I will finish college in about 2 and 1/2 years. I love my country (Perfect weather, incredible women, very funny people), but we are terrible in economics, I mean, the Venezuelan economic system has to be the worst joke I`ve ever seen (You guys can google it, just see the inflation rate, its funny stuff for some people, and now I including me). I just discovered Bitcoin 4 days ago, and then eventually turned my head into Litecoin (Love fresh starts, I think the Bitcoin train left without me), so yeah, Im kind of late. Right now Im updating the wallet and doing all that to start using Litecoin more frequently, I have never mined, I know nothing about this, just what Ive been reading non-stop since Monday.

OK! Sorry for the long explanation, but here is the main thing.
I live in a 3rd world country and is incredibly hard to buy $ or another Litecoin accepted currency to buy some LC. In fact, its illegal to buy $ here, I can go to jail if I do that (Obviously Im not...*cough*), but we have an extremely good flexibility to adopt new threads. 

Correct me if Im wrong but, the way to get litecoins (Nice amounts, not 0.0000001 in 1 month) here in Venezuela should be illegaly buying $ or another common currency and then buy them online, or mining (I have no practical experience so I wont know if could get like... 50 litecoins while leaving my PC on and mining 48 hours, or get nothing in a month, IDK if that is viable), but I think that, to introduce it to the Venezuelan market, someone here has to have a load (BIG LOAD) of litecoins and then start using them here. If you think Im wrong, please tell me, but remember, we CANT buy $, we are stuck with the Bolivar and that is worthless worldwide.

Do you guys think that I should invest time + money on mining litecoins (since I cant get a ASICs to compete in the bitcoin mining) and try to talk to big fishes to make it a viable non-government way of payment? Or better not seek for trouble and just try to think little, earn some Litecoins working online for them, mining some and give up on the Venezuelan market (Im planning to move out of here ASAP because of the insecurity)

Why would we have the highest LTC volume on greedy btc-e when we have a so much better alternative. 




Take a look at the stated features:




&gt;**Low trading fees**
Unlike other exchanges like MtGOX we only charge a flat 0.2% fee for trades. We aren't greedy!

&gt;**Secure C++ trading engine**
A well designed binary trading engine coded in the same programming language used for the New York Stock Exchange.

&gt;**Fast deposits and withdraws**
Our custom built clients allow you to use deposits within 10 to 30 minutes and withdraw within seconds.

&gt;**Anonymous trading**
No personal identification required. Once the funds are confirmed you can trade here, all we care about is reliable exchange.

&gt;**3 tier network security**
We have servers for providing the web interface, servers for the exchange and servers to hold all the funds.

&gt;**Great support**
Chat with the support staff or other members easily and in real-time. Whatever help you need is only a single click away.

Of how Litecoins got me Bob Dylan tickets, and how, regardless of the markets, I more than broke even on litecoins.  

I discovered Litecoins through /u/underswamp1008's comment on /u/lightsaberon's [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/1bo72e/making_bitcoins_for_beer_money/) about making bitcoins as beermoney, and decided this morning that investing in litecoins ahead of the Mt. Gox announcement was a good idea.  

Based on my budget, I decided that I could wager about $20 on litecoins, so I went about figuring out how to exchange my US dollars for litecoins.  My initial idea, after poking around BTC-e for a while, was to use one of their very sketchy looking Russian credit card processors.  Because I didn't trust their processors, I bought a Visa debit card to use for the transaction.  After buying the card and getting back to my dorm room, I saw /u/zdiggler's reply to my [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/litecoin/comments/1bt5eq/how_can_i_buy_litecoins/) here, and realized that I should follow their instructions.  

So I went online and set up the transaction, then went back into town, with the intent of using my Visa card at CVS to finish the transaction.  After much trouble with Moneygram, I finally got to the register, only to be informed that a Moneygram transaction had to be paid for in cash.  Having no cash on me, I ran to the bank to get cash.  

After visiting the ATM up the street, I was on my way back to the CVS, waiting to cross the street, when a stranger walked up to me, and offered me tickets to see the Bob Dylan concert tonight.  Of course, being a broke-ass college student, I accepted.  

Thus, I got to see Bob Dylan ($49.50 x 2 tickets plus unknown Ticketmaster fees) for free.  At this point, I don't care if I make money, lose money, or break even with Litecoin.  It got me free concert tickets.  And that's good enough for me.

Payment plugins for the major CMSes are being developed.  Coders in the community are working insane hours in order to get their concepts to market.  As of now, those that are mining are the majority holders of litecoin.  The first wave of merchants accepting Litecoin will be aimed specifically at the GPU miner.  Once, and only once, you understand the type of person it takes to run a successful GPU mining operation, you will then understand what the future holds for litecoin.  

The thing is, the successful GPU miner usually carries a diverse skillset as opposed to a single discipline.  You have to be proficient with hardware, code, operational and network security, just to name a few.  What ever a miners weakness, there's someone within the community that is proficient in that field and willing to give advice, tips and direction.  Then again, its also a matter of how you present youself to the community.  

If you don't take yourself seriously, don't expect anyone within the mining community to either.  We are businessmen with a twist: our business is our livelyhood. Do realize this: in the world of business, **respect and trust** are built on your actions, presentation, associations and resolve.  Respect is not an entitlement and trust must be built over time.

Also note that litcoin is still in its infancy.  If you look to bitcoins infancy, it was far more obscure and was used far more illicitly.  We are at the door of an incredible opportunity.  We can do right with litecoin what was done wrong with bitcoin in its earlier days.  A fresh face without the dark past that is growing at a rate far greater than any other crypto currency its age.  

You won't be buying a pizza with 10,000 litecoins.  Not now.  Not ever.  ",,False,self,t5_2szgd,False,,,True,t3_1b6hir,http://www.reddit.com/r/litecoin/comments/1b6hir/the_future_of_litecoin_an_essay/,

https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin  the litecoin project  repository was last updated  FIVE MONTHS AGO.  compare that with bitcoin.  bitcoin was updated only 2 days ago https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin

the litecoin infrastructure is weaker than bitcoin. 

the ltctip is missing in action, the developer is not directly/openly communicative (harebrained theory: he's acting on the d/l so he can snatch up as much litecoin for himself while he still can)

the blockchain explorer is not nearly good enough for litecoin

there are not any trustworthy litecoin markets or exchanges

the mainstream bitcoin services don't have a bolt-on tool that lets them easily go litecoin

finally, litecoin doesn't have a strong PR party line or marketing department, or as far as i'm aware, a truly compelling story

moreover its positioning is confused. some people use the silver:gold analogy, but isn't an ounce of silver ($26/oz) compared to an ounce of gold ($1500/oz), in the ratio of 0.017333?  ltc/btc on btc-e.com is trading at 0.02367

there's no litecoin page on wikipedia

even techies who've heard of bitcoin, haven't heard of litecoin.  outside the cryptocoin enthusiastc 

there aren't a lot of mainstream services that take litecoin.  there are no tools for them.  there aren't a lot of online illicit services that take litecoin (silk road, seals with clubs).

**Positives** 

faster transactions

another crypto chain adds robustness to the underlying bitcoin ecosystem (serving as a money laundering back alley)

project could fork in a different direction than bitcoin (although it hasn't been updated in 5 months, it's possible that it could attract renewed interest and enthusiasm in the community (from speculators?))

people put a ""1/4 of bitcoin"" potential USD mkt cap on Litecoin because there are 4 times as many bitcoins. (4 * 21 million = 84 million total possible litecoins)

attracts speculation since price is cheap, you feel like you are ""getting more leverage on bitcoin"" (assuming the litecoin:bitcoin ratio contracts, which assumes/requires an improved ecosystem)

it's believed ltc will trade on gox in not distant future, putting a limited commodity in front of a wider public..

My thoughts

*Easier to access information for network hashrate and ltc pricing, similar to bitcoin charts

*More places to spend litecoins, without a use this currency is just an investors version of penny stocks

*More media, the media and big investors are starting to hear of bitcoin but theres just not enough blog posts for people to notice litecoins and their advantage.

*A real litecoin exchange, btc-e is an eyesore that has huge charges for anyone wanting to purchase a small amount of litecoins. Now some of you may say, well mt gox is gonna add us bro. That's fine and dandy and will likely help litecoin but lets be honest. Mt Gox in its current state can't even stop the pitchforks being thrown at it by our siblings over at bitcoin.

In my view what would really help extend this lead is being first to add support for the zerocoin protocol.

Bitcoin is now too big and cautious to be first with this. In addition it would bloat the blockchain even more at a time when managing blockchain size and dust transactions are already taking a significant portion of development efforts.

Litecoin is presently in the fortunate position of having enough uptake and mindshare to be important but there still being relatively little real world implications of relatively major changes to its protocol.
My prediction is that the current relevant alt-chains to add zerocoin support will get a significant boost in popularity and uptake. 

It should be litecoin.

When Litecoin came around, it was one of a slew of different alt chains with not much to offer. It was basically, ""It's Bitcoin, but..."" and I figured doomed to fail like all the others. Being aware of a business concept called ""Network Effects,"" I didn't expect it to pose any competition to an already well established Bitcoin, even with shorter confirmation times. To me it seemed like basically a worthless waste of time that offers absolutely nothing that Bitcoin doesn't already offer, being mined and pushed by certain ""butthurt"" individuals who felt cheated about having missed out on easy mining and being early adopters. Frankly, my opinion on that still stands.

However, recently I've come to think about individuals having to manage vast quantities of wealth, and the issues that arise with that (think people like Sheldon Addleson, worth billions). You can't keep all that in a bank or as cash, because it's not insured against theft or devaluation. Stocks are risky. Bonds are safer, but also have risk. It's a problem of figuring out where to stick your money in a way that won't make you lose a lot of it due to some circumstantial fluke. With the rise of Bitcoin price, that made me reflect on the exact same issue that people with large bitcoin wealth have, too, and that's when I realized that Litecoin can be very important, too. Not as the silver to Bitcoins gold. Frankly, with Bitcoin getting all the attention on enabling transactions, I expect that Bitcoin will be the cash, and Litecoin will be the gold-like currency, useful only for storing wealth. No, it will be important because of one very important financial and investment concept: Diversification.

So, all you plucky Litecoin investors putting money into it thinking that you can still get in on the ground floor of something like Bitcoin, sorry to disappoint you, but I doubt that Litecoin will ever be anything like Bitcoin.

1) If Litecoins were as equally popular and in use as Bitcoins are right now, 4 LTC = 1 BTC would not hold. There are approximately 17 million Litecoins and 11 million Bitcoins existing in the coin supply right now. That is not even double. It is going to take a long while for Litecoin's coin supply to roughly equal 4 times the coin supply of Bitcoin, it's not going to happen next month or in 6 months.

2) Even when Litecoins are 4 times more plentiful in supply than Bitcoin, or similar, I still don't believe 4LTC = 1BTC will hold. It makes no sense because a Litecoin is not a Bitcoin. Litecoin has unique advantages over Bitcoin (faster transactions, fairer mining, apparently more secure than Bitcoin). If there are 4 times as many oranges in the world as apples that doesn't mean an orange costs one quarter of what an apple costs, because they have different qualities (flavour, texture etc). Replace apples and oranges with anything you like in that argument. In my opinion 4LTC = 1BTC would only hold if neither coin held an advantage over the other... but even then I bet it's not that simple. Maybe Bitcoin has a stronger brand or maybe the guy rumoured to hold one million bitcoins has died, meaning one million bitcoins are lost forever, or any other reasons you can think of. But I digress in that last sentence, and hope my 2 points come across.

The exchange would take a snapshot of both block chains after an interval and any new transactions that have been confirmed would be added together to get the exchange rate. people who sent litecoins would get an amount of bitcoins equal to (number_of_litecoins_they_sent/(total_litecoins_sent-fee)) * (total_bitcoins_sent-fee) and people who sent bitcoins would get in litecoins: (number_of_bitcoins_they_sent/(total_bitcoins_sent-fee)) * (total_litecoins_sent-fee).

To send the funds out the exchange would take the public key of the transaction used to deposit and use it to generate an address in the opposite currency. The user could then import the private key they used for litecoin into their bitcoin account or their private key from litecoin to control their bitcoin funds.

To make all this user friendly a website and or software client could be created to show the funds in the litecoin and bitcoin addresses so that people can see the exchange rate for the current round. A software client could read off of the users own copy of the blockchain or from a server like how electrum works and the location of the exchange itself could be kept hidden to prevent denial of service attacks. 

This method of exchange is [batch trading](http://financial-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Batch+Trading) which has its own positives and negatives but it would provide another choice that I believe would have some resistance to denial of service attacks. This form of trading would also have different characteristics when it comes to price manipulation.

So what do people think?

EDIT: just noticed I typed LTX instead of LTC in the title: oh well.

You could do this exchange model with PPC as well, or any crypto currency with compatible public-private keys.

Just wanted to try mining for a bit on a 6850.

Been following this  guide https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=83371.0

and I just can't get it to work. I keep getting errors about stuff being wrong in the reaper config or litecoin config file. 

At this point I think I want to mine in a pool, can anyone point me to a step by step guide on how to get that started?  Let's say I wanted to use notroll. I mined bitcoins a while  ago so I have some basic understanding of how it works, just can't get it set up properly.

Thank you.

For that experience I cannot thank all of you enough. 

In celebration of that, that guy gets a physical signed copy that I'm going to mail him! He volunteered his mailing info to me, and true to my word I stickied it to my monitor. That's not something I want  to ask just anyone for, so if you guys want to make donations and send me encouraging messages I will also send you something digital and something that will be unique from the public release.

Good evening Reddit community, my name is Steve Hufmann. As some of you already know, I am the co-founder of Reddit.

Firstly, I must apologize for the increased site downtime this week; there has been a heavy load on the servers since the Bitcoin mania has taken over the media. And of course the database rollback. There is a reason for this: many new features are being implemented on the site and will be revealed in due course.

We are now also ready to offer a very unique opportunity to a lucky few: the chance to invest in the site! That's right. It is truly a defining moment. I must be very clear and say that this is investment only, you will not own or have a say in any part of the running or management of Reddit. Please do not speak about this on the bitcoin sub-Reddit just yet as we are anticipating a lot of media attention over this and would like to minimize the impact if possible.

We are offering 300 investment shares of 0.1 percent of the income of the site (income excludes running costs &amp; management's share, staff etc.) which currently stands at ~$200'000 per month or $2'400'000 annually. Shares will be priced at $400 for a 0.1% share, paid in BTC (see below) at Mt. Gox's weighted average at that time. There is no limit on the amount of shares you can buy, and the amount we will be paying out equates to 25% of the sites income.

There is no limit to the amount of shares any one person can buy. For a 0.1% investment you will earn $200 per month, for a 0.5% investment you will earn $1000 a month and so on. As the site grows so will your pay-out, investments can be withdrawn at any time and pay-outs will be paid at the next pay-out date up to that point. This is a very unique opportunity and a chance to be a part of history. To our knowledge, we will be the FIRST company/website/blog to offer shares in Bitcoin.

Money invested is going to be used in the short-term to finance more servers and to cover more staff to enable us to make Reddit faster and better than ever before, with more staff to assist you and more features for you to make your experience that much better. Investors will have a new area within the site where they can see the amount they have invested, the next pay-out date, and the amount which will be updated hourly. You will also find options here to change pay-out schedule (weekly, monthly, annually), cancel investment &amp; change view types. We are done beta testing how the new layout will look.

Pay-outs will by default be paid monthly into a BTC wallet address that you will supply us; the schedule can be changed to weekly and a wallet address can be specified for payments. If you decide to cancel your investment, it will be refunded immediately.

Payment for your shares need to be paid to the address specified below, these are then tracked internally and after payment for 300 investments has been received the payment address will no longer be valid and payments will not be able to be made into it.

Payment address - 1K9n6GhReaBWqdBttUYMs3rka9Pj5L8RRd

If you receive an invalid wallet address error, you are too late.

Once you have opted into your shares, please reply to this message with 1) Your contact e-mail address 2) The Bitcoin wallet address you have opted in from (by default this will be where payouts are sent)

Your new investors section will become active 8-10 hours after payment is received. You can speed up this process by messaging the Reddit Support here [1] http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=Support with your Reddit User name &amp; Amount of investment shares and total BTC sent.

Example:

Subject - Reddit Investment Op JohDoe [Your User name goes here instead] 4 x 0.1 BTC 14.1024

This is strictly first come, first served. As mentioned before there is no limit on how many one person can buy. Again, this is the chance to be a part of the site and a part of history.

Thank you and good luck!

I have recently been mining a lot more LTC and have also moved some BTC into LTC, so I now have a wallet which is likely small compared to some, but to big to be lost.

I have litecoin-qt installed from a while back, but I am worrying a bit about security and recovery.

When looking at the client I can see that 'export', 'encrypt wallet' and 'change passphrase' are grayed out. So I expect at some point before I may have already encrypted the file, but I cannot remember ever setting a password. This has me concerned as if my hard drive fails and I have backed up wallet file, but no passphrase, I am screwed.

Would it be best to just start again and install a new instance of qt on a different PC and then send all of my new funds to a new LTC address? I can then set a new passphrase and drop my wallet.dat file into a hidden encrypted volume or better still set up a paper wallet?

Few ecommerce providers offer Litecoin as an option.

The blockchain.info Receive Payments API is a simple way for ecommerce developers to accept Bitcoin. You have a URL to which you send a *receiving address* and the API will generate a one-time *generated address* to which the customer sends money. One the server side where the API runs, this generated address is monitored and when payment comes in it is sent to the receiving address.

This method is dirt simple for the merchant to receive payment, even without using an ecommerce solution. However, it does assume trust in the API provider because the sender is sending money to that provider rather than directly to the merchant. 

I want whatever comes out of this to be open-sourced so that it can be adapted to other cryptocurrencies too, if desired. Further, anyone who can muster the trust of its users can set up a similar service. 

A few questions comes to mind. 

1. Is this even a good idea?
2. How would I go about offering a bounty to reach the right people?
3. How much is a reasonable amount for the work involved?

If they know about Bitcoins, be sure to relate Litecoins to Bitcoins and talk about how Litecoins are designed to be more practical for smaller and faster transactions than Bitcoins.  Litecoins are particularly great for the quick $1 - 500 transactions that are most common in day to day life, whereas Bitcoins are better geared to larger transactions where you don't mind waiting longer and paying larger fees to be sure they've gone through successfully.

If they know about mining, talk about how Litecoins are great because they will be able to take advantage of hardware which will no longer be efficient for Bitcoin mining as ASICs take over the Bitcoin network in the next few months.  Tell them how anyone who can buy a graphics card for their computer can mine Litecoins efficiently thanks to the ASIC-protective scrypt algorithm and how that will give more freedom to people in oppressive regimes like Venezuela by giving them a legal and discrete means of acquiring an internationally tradable currency.

If they have concerns about chain forks on Bitcoin taking down the network temporarily, talk about how Litecoin is the best fit as a backup chain to provide less risk to everyone of markets coming to a halt when a bug affects one of the networks.  Tell them this is because it's as fair as Bitcoin and can be mined with hardware that's no longer useful for Bitcoin mining.

If they know about other chains (PPcoin, Terracoin, Novacoin, etc.) tell them how they all have fatal flaws (they would all cannibalize hardware that could be used to mine Bitcoins, for instance).  Tell them how most are created by unethical developers (Novacoin and PPcoin were created such that an absurd number of coins were generated in the first week and very few are now... basically a premine, and Novacoin was even worse by actually premining coins and using them as a bribe in order to be accepted on the BTC-e exchange).  Litecoin on the other hand was created in an ethical way with no premining, no serious deviations from the Bitcoin philosophy, and in a way that allows it to coexist with a purpose alongside Bitcoin.  Litecoin's creator was even invited to speak at this year's Bitcoin conference and is well respected among the Bitcoin community.

If they aren't familiar with Bitcoin, tell them about how Bitcoin and Litecoin are based on the same technology which allows a limited money supply and secure transactions and wallets without having to rely on banks.  Tell them that they are the product of some of the world's greatest cryptography and networking geeks and are basically the internet of money; they are how everyone will do trade in a decade and they protect the whole world from the capricious instability of central banks.  Tell them that since the money supply is forever strictly limited, early adopters will be rewarded if they keep their savings in Bitcoins and Litecoins.

If they still only want their normal currency, tell them that it's easy to exchange Litecoins for national currencies with low fees (generally 1% or the cost of a wire transfer) and that Litecoins will still give them better protection from fraud because Litecoin transactions are quickly confirmed and irreversible.

If they really want to know more, give them this link: http://redd.it/1bbfdc

We need places to spend our coins and vendors stand to gain a lot from supporting Litecoins.  At this early stage, every new vendor will be big news in the Litecoin community, so tell them that they should expect free publicity from accepting Litecoins too.

I sadly must exit the litecoin mining hobby. I have a new room mate moving in and it's in my small condo taking up too much space.

I need it gone ASAP because my plan to host it in my friends garage went south.

I will be accepting LTC/BTC or USD. Best offer takes it as I had stop mining with it. 

My original minimum was $2K but I'm lowering it to **$1800**. I can't take much more of a loss than that. This will be a great addition to any farm or for new users as it is setup and ready to mine. 

As an FYI, I undervolted it so the entire system draws 1000w from the wall. Currently running it at 630khash a card at 60% fans and 70-78 degrees. I did have it at 650khash but reduced it because I could run with quiet fans, raising to 650 simply requires to change intensity from 19 to 20. Plus it's very hot in my condo and windows are a good 30 ft away, so your temps will probably be 65-70.

Here's my hardware, these are all sale prices on newegg. Also you'll get a 10+ manufacturer warranty as I have only had it mining for a little over a month. The game bundles still come with the cards too.

I will run down all the fees and transactions that took place. Total time was about 60 minutes (not counting ACH deposit). My goal was to withdraw $50.00.

1. I sent 14.3 LTC (valued at $3.5 USD, to equal $50) to BTC-E.com account. It arrived in my BTC-E.com account in about 5 minutes (no transaction fee out of Litecoin Wallet) (14.3 LTC)

2. I converted my LTC into BTC, which cost me .1 LTC and was an instant transfer. (.449 BTC)

3. Next, I withdrew my BTC to my CampBX account, took 60 minutes and cost me .01 BTC. With rounding error it deposited .438 BTC into my CampBX account. (.438 BTC)

4. Sold my BTC at CampBX for its market value, which had gone up a dollar or two in the time it took to get to this point. $50.15

5. Finally, deposited $50.15 into my checking account through ACH, this will take a day or two and cost me $2.

So I end up with $48 cash, took me about 60 minutes to accomplish but then you have to wait a day or two for the ACH to go through. If the price of Bitcoin had gone down during that time I think I would have started with a $50 value and been down to $45 or so.

I think I could end up having BTC transfer the cash to my account, if you trust them, I went with CampBX because they are located in the U.S.

The biggest hit came with the $2 ACH transfer to the bank account, but given that most people withdraw larger amounts this wouldn't be such an issue. Bitcoin really slowed down the process and CampBX took a while to credit my account.

1366968232.0,6,self.litecoin,1d57ts,"Repost from /r/Bitcoin: Authoring Books on Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Other Cryptocurrencies - How Do You Suggest I Publish?",8,2,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/litecoin/comments/1d57ts/repost_from_rbitcoin_authoring_books_on_bitcoin/,"Please note: By suggestion from /u/litecoin_messiah, I'm reposting this question here.

I'm a seasoned author with 20 IT books under my belt as well as hundreds of articles online and in print, although in a different discipline than Bitcoins. 

I've been thinking about writing books on Bitcoin and related technologies, but I would like your input on how to publish these, considering the way cryptocurrencies work.

I'm not very concerned with making money; I have income from my professional services that take care of that. I write because I love to write and for the conversation to which these books lead when I encounter people in communities. 

That said, I use professional editors, designers, and so on that cost me money, so I would like to have some way of recouperating at least direct costs, usually around $1,000 per book. 

I only do electronic books, and I do my own publishing these days. 

My options for distribution, as I've been considering them so far, are:

- Traditional publishing
 
I set a fixed price, put the books up on a web site, Amazon, iBookwhatever, B&amp;N, etc. 

Pro: Most likely to get direct costs covered. I also know very well how to do this. 

Con: A lot of people in the world simply can't afford even low prices ($5 will run a family for two days in Cambodia). Also, of course I want to accept Bitcoins, and maybe Litecoins and other cryptocurrencies as payment, but I can't accomplish that through external distributors like Amazon. 

- Pay anything, must pay something
 
I can set up a 'pay anything but must pay something' store, and set the minimum price to US$0.01 or whatever the shopping system will support as minimum payment. 

Pro: Drives adoption; users must adopt Bitcoins to pay for books. Also allows anyone to buy book. 

Con: I'll likely end up covering most costs myself, which is fine in an economic sense, but maybe not in a motivational sense (hah, it's only worth $0.01, anyone can write something valued that)

- Community investor funding
 
To cover minium cost, I can set up, through one of the BTC or LTC stock exchanges, a community funded project and sell 'shares' that will cover initial cost and yield any proceeds back to the community investors. 

A variety of this is that readers can pay anything for three months or until the investors get their money back plus a risk premium, and after that, the books are free for all.

Pro: Makes sure costs are covered and can yield some return to those that agree to fund a book in return for their risk. Also allows me to learn how assets in these markets work (and I want that).

Con: Complex to set up, may be difficult to get people to buy a book that will initially cost money but later be free.

For option 3, assuming the 'free after X months' variation, I was actually thinking time-sensitive things would be more relevant and could encourage people to get the book early, for example a book on cryptocoin mining will be more valuable early. 

I would love your input on how I should publish. I'm sure there are far more ideas than these, and I'm open to anything that will best serve the readers, the community, my motivation, and not cost me too much money, in that order. 

I understand well how traditional publishing works after having published almost 20 books myself and ran an industry magazine for several years, but I would like to explore better ways of doing publishing that are more suited to the community they target.

The article should cover:

* 1) The Scrypt algorythim explained, and how to compares to AES (un-bias)
* 2) The reason for creation; less ASIC more CPU/GPU balanced (memory intensive)
* 3) It an experiment as an 2nd Blockchain, again, unbiased

""Dear All,

I may be without Internet access this weekend so I have scheduled an estimated dividend now for Sunday. It is based on the revenue generation so far this week extrapolated up to Sunday. I shall redress differences next week.

Total profits for the pro-rated week were EUR 958, and we have added EUR 617 to the hardware reinvestment fund. 

Early next week, or if possible over the weekend, I intend to release an updated version of the financial model and forecasts taking into account the precipitous rise in difficulty. Thanks to the cost of ASIC hardware falling at a similar rate this does not actually affect us as badly as one might think.

One that priority is out the way I shall also raise a motion to decide on whether we should leverage the business be issuing a bond or loan instrument with which we would purchase additional mining hardware.
""
-Kate.

This sentence ""Thanks to the cost of ASIC hardware falling at a similar rate this does not actually affect us as badly as one might think."" should be absolutely terrifying if you are a Ciphermine shareholder.  This statement would only be true if equipment delivery for new hardware kept in pace as well.  The fact that future products are cheaper in $/GH means very little if none of the equipment is deliverable in the near term.  

Also the yield on Ciphermine is going to be almost 10X less than the bond they are offering, how do they expect to generate the cash for these bonds with their current business.  It's almost like they're trying to make a big bet on LTC via this bond offering since the assets payback is euro denominated.  

All in all I see a lot of red flags.  Feel free to disagree I'm genuinely curious why people would hold this asset.

Where: Central Market &amp; Lamar  (We usually meet at some tables outside the cafe)

When: 7:00 pm Tuesday August 6

Topics:  All things Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ripple, etc.

We have voted to continue to have weekly meetings.  One of the meetings per month is going to be on the weekend for people that want to travel to attend.

This meeting we will settle on the Weekend meetup date.

We will also discuss and settle on a presentation format.  The idea is to kick off each meetup with a couple of presentations on Bitcoin projects, research, and/or observations.  We will follow that with the usual scattering of discussions among each other.

My goal is to decide upon, and schedule speakers starting next meetup, i.e. August 13.",,False,self,t5_2szgd,False,,,True,t3_1jrfkx,http://www.reddit.com/r/litecoin/comments/1jrfkx/austin_texas_bitcoin_meetup_tuesday_august_6/,

I have a 5870 that does not fit in my current case.
The length of the extender, per Amazon, is 7.7in which I am assuming is the full length of the cord. 
My case comes exactly to 7 inches. My thought, if it did reach, would be to rig up something to hold the gfx card outside of the case.

Also, [this](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B008BZBFTG/ref=cm_sw_r_an_am_ap_am_us?ie=UTF8) will work with the 5870, right?

Miners are a strong driver of the selling price of Litecoin, if not *the* driver. When you create a sell order (asks) on BTC-e or another exchange, they tend to fill in a default price that will match some existing buy orders (bids). This is BAD, because as a miner you should DICTATE the price you want for your coins.

So, how do you, as a miner, determine what the price should be? Simple: you overlay a difficulty graph on to a trading graph, and you try and keep them aligned. ***At the moment the trading price is way, way below the difficulty graph, miners are getting screwed.*** I know that matching the graphs is painful, so don't worry, CryptoCoinCharts has done the heavy lifting for you:

[Here's the graph if you sell LTC for USD](http://www.cryptocoincharts.info/period-charts.php?period=3-months&amp;resolution=day&amp;pair=ltc-usd&amp;market=btc-e)

[Here's the graph if you sell LTC for BTC](http://www.cryptocoincharts.info/period-charts.php?period=3-months&amp;resolution=day&amp;pair=ltc-btc&amp;market=btc-e)

Ideally, the trading price should match or exceed the price as indicated by the difficulty graph. If enough miners refuse to sell at a low, unprofitable price, then the exchange rate will catch up to difficulty, and we'll all profit. ***You*** control the price, the demand to purchase is created by traders and individuals who want to use Litecoin to make purchases.

I just added the ability to register a .bit domain on dotbit.me using Litecoins. I'm charging 1 Litecoin per domain and year which is much lower than the current cost in Bitcoins and Namecoins (as it's a new ""beta"" feature).

Please let me know what you think about the interface. The idea is to make a rather complex process ([registering a .bit domain manually](http://dot-bit.org/HowToRegisterAndConfigureBitDomains)) as simple as possible.

Thanks!

So I've decided to pour some cash into LTC in hoping that it will be a well returned investment. I've played a bit with trading on BTC-E (first lesson learned: buying at $4:00+ was stupid). Since then, I've played a bit with basic strategies, e.g., buy low, sell high. But I'm pretty lost when it comes to any long term strategy... 

Does anyone have any ideas about where to go in terms of learning some strategies that are applicable to currency trading / cryptocurrency trading, specifically? 

And yes, I have spent some time on Google, the Forex tutorials, but it's kind of overwhelming when I don't even know if what I'm learning is applicable to trades like BTC-E (and hopefully Gox, soon!).

My question is, if I change the price to a different number, calculate and commit, does it do it at the price **I specified** or what the actual trading price is at that moment?

For example, let's say I want to sell 500 LTC and it is currently trading at $4.05.  If I change the price to $4.10, calculate and hit Sell, will it sell my LTC if/when it hits my specified price of $4.10?

In the dropdown menu, I selected CVS as the place to make my deposit (this deposit is in the form of moneygram, so you can go anywhere that does moneygram). I then typed in how much money I wanted to deposit (along with email and other information that must be correct for later step), then printed out the form. This form has a 'receive code' on it, and an 'account number'. I then put the form in my pocket, went to my local CVS, asked the cashier for assistance in using moneygram, gave her cash and numbers from the form I printed off, got an OK that it went through and left. I then had to go home, and log onto vircurex. Under 'make a deposit', I typed in the VouchX code that got emailed to me after I made the moneygram deposit at CVS. VOILA! Money in vircurex account!
I placed a USD to LTC order, and within a day, all my funds were in LTC. After a day of dealing with Vircurex's confusing website interface and less that desirable ltc prices, I transfered my LTC to btc-e. Transferring LTC from vircurex to btc-e is easy. Simply register at btc-e, go to finances, then to the right of LTC, click 'make a deposit'. After clicking this, your btc-e account's deposit address will appear. This address should look like a long strand of random numbers and letters. Now go back to vircurex, click account, then to the right of LTC click make a withdrawal, then it will ask you to type in how much LTC you would like to withdrawal, and the address of where you want to send this money. This address is that long letter and number sequence that you found on your btc-e account. I pressed enter, and funds transfered over for me in about 30 minutes. Remember, to transfer funds from vircurex to btc-e, it must be in the form of a crytocurrency (btc, ltc). USD will not transfer over from my experience.

  So, I literally know next to nothing. I'd usually refrain from such a beginner post, but there's nothing against it in your sidebar. I've heard of bitcoin before, but I only heard of litecoin last night from a family friend. This family friend claims that LTC is gonna explode soon, so I'm very interested. I have a few questions:

* Can I mine effectively on a computer **not** a 100% dedicated to such? Without overclocking? I'd leave it running when I was at school, maybe overnight every other night. Other I'd use it as a normal PC. Gaming, image processing (photo major), Redditing, etc.

* I have a nice CPU, nicer GPU. Which should I mine with? Which is less painful to my PC?

* Will I significantly shorten my PC's lifespan? It's only a few months old, but I'm assuming I'll be running it MUCH more. 

* My objective here would be to make LTC, then convert to USD once I could make a profit from it. I'm **NOT** interested in tax evasion whatsoever. Is this a reasonable plan? I have zero experience in currency trading, which I assume this is.

Currently I have 4 computers in my house CPU mining, and while the returns aren't fantastic, the experiment/ideology of it is fun and the computers are always on anyways.

Tonight I decided to try and swap my GPU over to Litecoin mining just to see if I could get it configured properly. I am using CGminer and it was quite easy to get converted. My 7950 was turning over 400+kH/second in CGminer which is about what I expected from my research online.

However, I only saw ~100kH/s registering at the mining pool I belong to. (pool-x.eu if that matters).

Does anybody have any idea why the speed doesn't translate over. If I could get the 400kH at the pool end it would mean LTC mining is currently more profitable to me than BTC mining, but at quarter speed it isn't worth tying up my GPU.

Is there another pool anybody could recommend, or something I am missing here?

The functionality and promising futures of these currencies are really bright. Especially in light of the abusive central bank money printing policies undertaken at this time. I became a member of Mt Gox several months ago where I learned to purchase and trade in BTC. The exchange was very pleasant to work with. I soon came to hear of BTC-E.com and how many more options are out there for trade. I became a confirmed member last moth and purchased some LiteCoin. The LiteCoin was on a roll, and I was happy to let things sit in the exchange wallet for a while. My password was strong. 15 Characters with a mixture of Uppercase, lowercase, numbers and symbols. I managed and IT shop for 5 years and I know the value of strong passwords (AND NOT TO SHARE THEM). I have multiple strengths and multiple passwords I rotate through on a regular basis. So I checked my account in BTC-E recently and found all of my LiteCoin has been withdrawn over 12 hours after my last login. Who did this? Well I complained to BTE-E customer service, and requested an investigation. A few days later BTC-E sends me a list of login times and IP addresses. GREAT....It is plain as day someone from a completely strange IP address logged in and stole my LiteCoin. How? I didn't receive any notification of sucessful login as is usually sent out by BTC-E.com when the account is accessed. So How? I received an incomplete sentence saying, ""Your email hacked."" not even a complete sentence. Who are these people running BTC-E.com? I really don't know, but their customer service stinks, and their trustworthyness has been lost with me. No one in my circle even understands how these currencies work. No one in my circle of contacts would even know how to access or use the LiteCoin, let alone have access to my password. So I am only left to believe someone on the inside of BTC-E.com is strategically targeting accountholders and transferring out LiteCoin for their benefit. Be careful everyone. I hope things improve because I do see this currency having a big place in the future. These exchanges need to step up, improve their security, and work together to prevent fraud like this from happening to others. Improving the faith in these emergeng currencies should be the goal of all exchanges and users. And to the person who stole my 4 grand.....I hope you choke on it.

... but first things first.  do you think the concept is valid?  (Please explain why or why not.)  And what things would you place into consideration if you wanted to do such a thing?  Legal structure, advertising in certain areas (i.e. craigslist), a formal/informal organizational style, maybe doing preliminary meetings in certain places in your city/town with specific people to hash out the details?  what kind of an online presence should the group have (i.e., bylaws, IRC channel, reddit?)

Or better yet, how would you run one?

Myself, I'd probably start a group on meetup.com, maybe arrange meetings at the local library, take it from there...?  prolly wouldn't bother with a formal legal structure (reflecting the decentralized nature of LTC), but at least some sort of... legal recourse, you know?  like notarized agreements an' such, idk.

I mean why doesnt everyone not just buy great mining cards, but get a $1000 loan and build 3 x 7950 shell computers?

Anyways, I'd love to discuss all of that, but I also want to know about buying a GPU because of mining. So clearly all the 5xxx and 6xxx series cards are way expensive on ebay due to mining, but I'm not opposed to buying ebay/craigslist/whatever, but it looks like the best card for mining right now is the 7950 (since it's still at MSRP or below, 7970 is almost 2x price for less than 50% performance increase).

I just didn't know which 7950 to go for, I dont want something dumb like voltage locked or a bad VRM. I'd be up for any card, frankly, so I'm all ears. 

System Specs:

* i7-3770k 5ghz@1.5v offset voltage (~200w consumption full load)
* 4x2GB  PSC RAM 2200mhz 8-11-8-28-80-1T
* Z77X-UD5H
* Rosewill Capstone 550m
* 8 case fans

EDIT: Okay, I really think it's best I take the plunge and buy a Sapphire Dual-X 7950 ($279 AR Tigerdirect). Hopefully in a month's time I'll know more, about whether I should invest a large amount of money into mining rigs, etc.... but $1000 really isn't that much money, as noted, you can sell the hardware in a year for a good portion of it back, etc... why isn't everyone just not getting $1000 into multiple mining set-ups? $2000? I mean that really isn't that much money, the monthly payments isn't much. Very few businesses make their start-up costs back up in a month or two, much less in a year...

Anyways - sapphire dual-x 7950, it's not voltage locked or gimped in any way, it's a good card for an enthusiast like me who likes to delid, max overclock, all that sort of stuff?

Second stage will happen after the first stage. The USD price of bitcoin is unstable and sudden downward corrections are almost certain. During one such crash, when LTC has had enough exposure, speculators will exit BTC and enter the rising LTC market. This will cause a positive feedback loop as BTC price drops even lower and LTC price rises. During the most recent bubble the mainstream media paid attention to bitcoin.

Today I came up with an idea to buy some LTC. (I started mining with friends and I found this as good idea) So I registered at btc-e.com and  I found out that my paypal is useless there. So I registered also at OKPAY but the verification seems to take few days. Not very happy of it but on the other hand cca 1 hour after my registrations the value started to fall down rapidly:) But still - I want to buy at least 250 litecoins.

Does anyone here want to sell and is accepting paypal? (I use paypal for a long time but I have never use it for buying BTC or LTC etc. so I cannot imagine if it is even possible).

At least Thank You for reading.

with best regards
Karol

1363639963.0,5,self.litecoin,1ajpgv,GPU-friendly mining. 1m BTC market cap. 84m coins. 2.5 minute blocks. A Bitcoiner's report on Litecoin.,5,0,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/litecoin/comments/1ajpgv/gpufriendly_mining_1m_btc_market_cap_84m_coins_25/,"Litecoin, a Bitcoin-like Internet currency has seen its network gain significant hashing power in recent weeks, but the currency's long-term prospects remain unclear. This post aims to provide more information about the Litecoin network and currency.

In early to mid 2013, Bitcoin mining is likely to become largely unprofitable for GPU-miners due to the rise of efficient Bitcoin mining ASICs. It is expected that many GPUs will be removed from securing the Bitcoin network and will be redeployed for other purposes. Besides Bitcoin mining, there are three such uses for these GPUs: 1) gaming, 2) password recovery and security testing and 3) non-Bitcoin cryptocurrency mining. Since Litecoin is the cryptocurrency with the next greatest hashing power and is most efficiently mined with GPUs, understanding the current status of the Litecoin network and economy is desirable for those studying the options. Below, I have gathered information to help inform a decision on whether to commit resources to Litecoin.

**Miners**

The current hashrate of the network is roughly 3 gigahashes per second (GH/s). Due to Litecoin's scrypt-based mining algorithm, Litecoin hashrates are generally 1000 times slower than when mining Bitcoin on comparable hardware. Therefore, this hash rate is produced by an amount of hardware that would produce 3 terahashes per second (TH/s) on the Bitcoin newtork. The current 15-day window estimate for Bitcoin hashrate is 40 TH/s meaning the Litecoin network is roughly 7% the strength of the Bitcoin network.

**History**

Litecoin's genesis block was mined on Thursday Oct 13, 2011 at 03:00 GMT. Since then, over 15.5 million litecoins have been mined in the first 310,000 blocks. The network releases 50 litecoins per block which are targeted to be found evey 2.5 minutes on average. The block reward will halve every 840,000 blocks which will cause the network to produce 84 million litecoins in total.

The currency has traded in the 1.22 mBTC to 17.3 mBTC range since its birth. Trading is highly volatile with 40-50% changes occuring on a daily basis. Most trading volume can be found on the BTC-e exchange (https://btc-e.com) in the LTC/BTC market by a margin of 2:1 over the next highest volume of LTC/USD also at BTC-e. Other supporting LTC/BTC exchanges include Vircurex (https://vircurex.com) and BitParking (https://ltcexchange.bitparking.com).

    All-time price statistics
    -------------------------
    BTC - high: 17.69 mBTC on 3/12/2013     low: 1.22 mBTC on 8/15/2012
    USD - high: $0.75 on 3/7/2013     low: $0.015 on 8/15/2012

The current exchange rate for Litecoin at BTC-e is 12.3 mBTC or $0.55 for one litecoin.

**Early-adopter advantage**

The ability to acquire currency units cheaply through purchase or mining provided an important incentive to Bitcoin's earlier-adopters. By risking the loss of their time and money they have shared in financial gains proportional to the exchange rate and, by extension, the success of the system. Litecoin has a similar early-adopter incentive with one difference. Its launch into an already-sizeable community meant that a greater number of stakeholders existed from the beginning than were aware of Bitcoin in 2009. 

A large proportion of early bitcoins were mined when it was extremely unclear if Bitcoin would last beyond a brief experiment. It is then reasonable to expect that many early users did not keep their wallet files or private keys and that a large proportion of early coins will never be spent. While it is difficult to estimate the magnitude of this effect, it provides a potential source of volatility in the future. In contrast, early Litecoin users, most of which were familiar with Bitcoin, could expect that Litecoin's success would make their coins worth keeping. The %-days-destroyed metric tracks what fraction of the money supply has moved since it was mined and for Litecoin is 60.3% versus Bitcoin's 43.7%.

**Diversification**

Diversification helps to reduce risk and increase reliability of investments and technological systems respectively. Since Litecoin is the second-most established cryptocurrency and is also blockchain-based it may be used easily to diversify Bitcoin-denominated investments. The unique ease of currency exchange beween this currency pair results from each currency's decentralized management and low transfer fees. While current trading volumes and high volatiltiy limit Litecoin's use for significant and stable diversification, more research into LTC/BTC, LTC/USD, and BTC/USD exchange rate relationships is advised.

From a technical standpoint, Litecoin shares many features and the vast majority of its codebase with Bitcoin. Litecoin therefor provides little additional security benefit to the cryptocurrency ecosphere as bugs found in Bitcoin are likely to apply to Litecoin. Mining infrastructure is probably where Litecoin offers the greatest independence from Bitcoin due to Litecoin's use of the scrypt mining algorithm.

Since Litecoin is very similar in use, Bitcoin-accepting merchants and payment processors can support Litecoin payments with minor modifications to the software they are using though at this time only a small number of businesses accept Litecoin.

**Development**

The core client Litecoin-qt/litecoind is based on Bitcoin-qt/bitcoind. It is currently at version 0.6.3 and is based on the same Bitcoin software version. It is 8 months behind the current Bitcoin client. The Litecoin codebase is maintained at https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin as a fork of the https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin project. While the same revision control system is in use, the current development model lacks the formal testing and release verification of bitcoin-qt/bitcoind.

Outside the core client codebase, many of the documents and websites created when Litecoin was launched remain untouched, display incorrect information, or have disappeared completely though a number of new sites and services have appeared in recent weeks.

**Service Availability**

While Litecoin services such as a block explorer, historical charts, and an Instawallet-like web wallet do exist, there are a number of important services that are not yet available. There is no client-side encrypted web-based wallet comparable to Blockchain.info/wallet or the extensive macroeconomic charts at that same site. Mobile software is also limited to a few mining programs with no mobile wallet or exchange rate monitor apps available. Finally, exchange volume is highly centralized on the BTC-e exchange and there is no payment processor that provides any functionality similar to Bit-Pay or Coinbase.

**Conclusion**

This report has provided information on the Litecoin peer to peer Internet currency and will likely be obsolete within hours of its release in many of the figures quoted.

For the past 6 months we have been working on developing fpga boards for litecoin mining. Why? Because fpga's simply save money from all the power needed for gpu miners. We have successfully accomplished a 223kh fpga and a fpga quad that mines at an average or 811kh. We are looking to advance our technology and take it even bigger. Our goal is to get an fpga board to 500 kh and the quads to 2.3-2.5 mh. We are hoping to reach out to the litecoin community for donations. As of now, any bitcointalk.org member or reddit member that donates a verified 1ltc or more will be entered to win one of our miners when we release them to the public. We are also looking for more developers to join our team. We plan on opening everything up to the general public in about 6 months. Why the wait? We want to wait unitl mtgox starts hosting litecoin so it will draw more attention to our miners. If you to join our team, yes you will obviously get mining equipment before then. Its totally free to join our team, as long as you have some since in technology, crytocurrency, and can communicate or some stay in new york for a while with us. the ltc address for donations is 
LW8WpUzkwueaa7MAc2STQAqaKU77TAzzLh and LLKNRquZQrR3Kr47xvegbkmtYJLLMjJu7D

two of my team members will be monitoring the donations so that is why there is two addresses. A verified donation is when you pm or send us a email with your username on any forum and the address you are sending coins from. That way we can enter you in the drawing for the miners. We plan on giving 10-15 of them away. Help us out litecoin community. We would upload images and pictures of our devices but that gives the risk of someone stealing our technology. Stay tuned though, this will be the permanent forum on here for our development. The email for donation wise, questions or to join our team is litecoindeveloper@yahoo.com. If you are attempting to join our team please list what you can bring to the table. Thank you

I fully intend for this to be a discussion and not a BTC/LTC flamewar.  I welcome all constructive feedback and criticism.*

So I see so many posts about which is better, LTC or BTC.  Which should I buy?  Which should I trade to/from?  Which is better? Etc.

Let me begin with this fact.  From my research, BTC are a much more stable and popular currency by far.  LTC's are gaining popularity, but BTC still has the crown.  So please keep that in mind while considering my opinions below.

**Value:**  With the big spike we saw in the last 2 weeks it's difficult to gauge which one is better.  BTC are obviously worth more now and I believe will remain so.  Why?  Two reasons.  First, BTC has a cap of 21 million and LTC has a cap of 80(?) million.  So just looking at it from an end game perspective, BTC's being more rare will hold more value.  Second, if you look at charts over the past month, BTC and LTC are virtually identical in their rise and fall. See links below.

(BTC) http://i.imgur.com/coTnc2K.png

(LTC) http://i.imgur.com/F4lNZzz.png

So why would LTC's surpass BTC's in value if the charts from the past month are any indicator?  Sure it's only a month, but the similarities are almost identical.

**Profitability:**  Let's be honest.  Most people want to make money by either mining or trading in this currency.  Sure there are those who are in it for the science/crypto knowledge, but most just want to try and make some money.  So we have 2 choices for each.  Mine yourself or buy outright. 
* Mining: Well, assuming you have some decent hardware to dedicate to mining in the first place, it's no secret that mining for LTC's right now are currently more efficient than mining for BTC's.  I think the gap is closing, but LTC's are still more efficient.  So why mine?  Because in the long run you'll probably edge out those who are sticking with BTC.  Might not be by much, but just enough to justify going the LTC route vs the BTC route.  And this is also going to depend on the hardware you're running, electricity costs and depreciation of your hardware.  And this is all assuming the difficulty for each remains the same.
* Buying: So what if I don't have any hardware to justify mining but still want to try and make some money with LTC/BTC?  You can buy BTC from several different sources.  You can also exchange them for LTC however you're going to get charged some fees along the way, making the LTC's almost not worth the effort.  Since the rise and fall of both seem to mirror each other, it doesn't seem to be a great idea to buy LTC's since there are more fees involved.  However, if LTC's hit the MTGox like everyone is saying, this point may be irrelevant.  And again as stated above, BTC are the more popular, stable currency.  Just because BTC are worth more per unit, doesn't mean that it's dumb to buy when LTC are a fraction of the cost per unit.

**Bottom line:**  If you're going to mine, I'd go the LTC route.  More efficient and, in most cases, still worth the effort.  If you're going to buy, I'd go the BTC route.  It's a more stable currency and you're probably not gaining anything by buying a less popular currency that may or may not stick around.
