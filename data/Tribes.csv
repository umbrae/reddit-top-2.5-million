1335895227.0,526,self.Tribes,t1t7a,Extremely important .ini tweak that drastically improves mouse responsiveness. Should be included in-game.,629,103,189,http://www.reddit.com/r/Tribes/comments/t1t7a/extremely_important_ini_tweak_that_drastically/,"Before you read the following fix, I'd like to ask one main thing in the following responses:

ASK HI REZ TO INCLUDE THIS AS AN IN-GAME MENU OPTION. 

My basic understanding of the below fix is as follows: Essentially, UE3 by default decides to lag mouse inputs in exchange for better frame rate. It's a setting that while not a big deal for console games, is a huge deal for PC games. 

By turning the OneFrameThreadLag setting to false, you'll notice an immediate and sudden improvement in how your mouse feels in game. This is because your direct input is no longer delayed by X amount of frames. 

Please note though, that as mentioned above, this does come at a frame rate penalty. If you're on a PC that can barely play T:A in its current form, this fix might make the game unplayable. If you're on a more modern  PC, you shouldn't have a noticable frame hit. 

Fix is below this line.



Go to: 

C:\Users\*YOUR PC NAME*\Documents\My Games\Tribes Ascend\TribesGame\Config

Open:

Tribes.ini

Insert under DirectionalLightMaps=True the following:

""OneFrameThreadLag=False"" (without "" marks)

Save the ini.

Enjoy drastically increased mouse responsiveness. 

edit:

I also made a thread on the Hi Rez forums if you want to show support for this being an officially supported menu option. : http://forum.hirezstudios.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=313&amp;t=70201

This has happened to me **twice** in the past month.

The first time was on Sunday morning a few weeks ago. I was booted out of a game and got a ban message at the login screen. Support told me:

&gt; Your account was in violation of section 3f of the EULA for using cheats, automation software (bots), hacks, mods or any unauthorized third-party technology, software, tools or content designed to modify the Software Product, the Service or Site. After additional review of the evidence, we stand by the ban. We appreciate your understanding in this matter.

I don't cheat. I checked with a few other people I play with who aren't banned and there's nothing unusual running on my system that nobody else has. The only unique thing in my case is that I can't play the game without being reported dozens of times a day by people who presumably have never played an FPS before.

I offered to send videos of me playing along with any information about my system in case there was something setting off a false flag, but they closed the ticket without responding. It wasn't until I messaged an admin on the forums that they actually looked into it. They realized their error, told me it was ""an extremely rare case"", and after 3 days I was unbanned. No apology, no explanation, and no compensation for lost time.

This past Sunday morning I was booted out of a game again and met with another ban message. Same thing, same time, same day of the week. The only difference this time is that it [doesn't even let me get past the launcher](http://i.imgur.com/kbOax.jpg). I sent a support ticket which was closed without any response, and they deactivated my forum account when I tried to contact an admin. I gave support one last try and sent them several videos of TDM rounds I had recorded over the past month, plus a list and description of every process running on my system when I play. They ignored everything and gave me the exact same automated response from the first time I was banned. I haven't gotten any word from them since.

Here are some of the videos I sent: [1](http://youtu.be/gejDjbFRb_8), [2](http://youtu.be/PdgIpIiyIgA), [3](http://youtu.be/nUBquCseZGc), [4](http://youtu.be/88Znuqnh08Y)

Update: Hi-Rez insists that they don't ban solely based on player reports and human review all bans. It seems they actually thought I was cheating, but that still doesn't explain my first ban. If what they say is true, then the problem must lie in their human review being less than reliable. It's been nearly a month now and I'm still banned, with my last support ticket sitting at ""researching"" for weeks.",,False,self,t5_2rdsl,1341674012.0,,,True,t3_v09pz,http://www.reddit.com/r/Tribes/comments/v09pz/a_warning_to_anyone_who_is_good_at_this_game/,

* add icons for turrets and sensors next to the generator icon
* own team is always blue, enemy team is always red, **but** Sandrakers always have blue icons and Butchers always have red icons
* when there is a vote to kick someone there's a prompt that says F5 = No; F6 = Yes, but it is actually F6 = No and F7 = Yes
* time left on team selection is always 10:35
* there's no indication (neither visual nor audio) how long it takes for claymores to be primed (it's about 2 seconds); and while we're at it, there's a bug where the claymore explodes if you walk over it before it's primed
* icons for *call ins* (tactital, supply, orbital) don't update properly with current amount of credits
* in spectator mode, the *time until next health regen* is fixed at 204 seconds
* after opening a menu via shortcut (e.g. J for friends list), the escape key loops between the class menu and the main menu, not exiting back to the game and requiring a mouse click to the bottom left
* Kill details cover up VGS http://i.imgur.com/IM6SP.jpg
* UI elements cover up the flag marker http://i.imgur.com/DbFOg.jpg

Training - Target Practice

* Most bots have the symbol for heavy armor, regardless of their armor type. Since tutorials are for noobs, that's extra confusing.

General

The UI looks like it was made for a console. The class edit could greatly benefit from a UI where you can edit your loadout of a class in just one page.

I did PM HiRezTodd and make him aware of the amount of people affected by this per the reddit thread. Stuff is going to be looked into. Todd noted that things might have gotten stuck somewhere inbetween HiRez and the tournament organizers themselves. So for now I'm going to have faith that stuff will get taken care of in a relatively expedient manner.  Thanks for the support everyone on the thread :]

--------------------------------------

ORIGINAL POST: 


Despite repeatedly assurances from Bart *weeks* ago that money for these events would be coming ""soon"", the players who are due money have still yet to be paid. Moreover, whenever people by proxy attempt to get information out of Bart on when payment is coming, he suddenly becomes unavailable. 

So I am now making this post in an effort to push this to the top of Bart's priority list so that this can be taken care of in an expedient manner. Please throw your support behind this thread if you can - it's ridiculous that with the money Hi Rez has made off tribes, that payment of relatively small tournament sums (to the amount they've made) would be so vastly delayed. 

Thanks in advance :) 

EDIT: Though I can't 100% confirm, judging from a response to this reddit post it looks as though the winners of the ESL tournament have also not been paid anything. They would be the most overdue payment of all as that tournament was one of the very first after the original CSN.

Edit #2 so people are more clear: Between ESL, FPSGeneral, and NASL, 16,000 in total has not been paid (spread out among the competitive players who won their share of that of course.) 3,500 ESL, 2,500 FPSGeneral, 10,000 NASL respectively. There's also quite a bit of Tribes gold that was supposed to be delivered in these tournaments that was also never given to the players. 

EDIT #3: Just so people have an idea in regards to the failure in execution on HiRez's part that goes beyond any real financial concerns. Many of the tournaments listed above *also* had Tribes Gold rewards that were never delivered. Rewards that should take zero processing time on the part of Hi Rez. Which means that whoever is in charge of distributing all of this is fucking up hard.

During beta, I bought a booster pack and got the vip status, and honestly didn't want to play once I saw how little xp I earned from matches without a booster.  

Then playing during this double xp weekend, it felt like a natural progression of xp, where getting 1,500+ a round was a little more common, and good matches were almost 3,000.

I know HI-REZ needs to make money, but man if they would just increase the xp earned to somewhere around this weekend's rate, I know I would be much more interested to play on a normal basis.

Am I the only one who thinks like this?  Or am I just asking for too much out of an already awesome f2p?

edit:I somewhat gathered that we can all agree that vip status accounts should at least get somewhat higher xp gain than what it is currently, for those that paid something, and earning just a bit more xp would help to actually be able to afford unlocks without the need for further boosters.

/r/Tribes is constantly growing and evolving, so these rules *might* change over time.

I suppose now is a good time to give a brief update on the state of /r/tribes, with the game being released yesterday and all.  Traffic-wise, I think all the attention broke the stats page a bit.  While I can't give you any visitor stats, I can tell you that we got over 1200 subscribers in just *one day*.  

[Latest stats](http://i.imgur.com/GL0uf.png)

I'm sure within a day or two the other stats will finally show up.  Or not.  Who knows.  For all you new subscribers, here are the rules for this subreddit:

No memes. This includes pictures, comics, gifs and videos. There's a subreddit specifically for these over at /r/shazbot. This has been a rule since the early days of /r/tribes and won't be changing. [**Why this rule exists.**](http://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/o1zjo/ban_memes_in_rpsychonaut/c3drsz4)

Anything Tribes related (other than memes of course) is allowed. News, images* , videos, interviews, discussion topics. The list goes on. Basically, if it isn't a meme and deals with the Tribes franchise, chances are it's allowed.

As with all of Reddit, no posting personal information of other members or Hi-Rez employees. This includes, but isn't limited to, a user's real name, location, job and home phone/cellphone number. If you have an issue with someone, PM them or find some way to contact them privately.

* I'm *okay* with images on /r/tribes, but I don't want it to get too excessive. Basically I don't want to turn this subreddit into an [imageboard](http://reddit.com/r/thewalkingdead). Unfortunately this is a bit of a grey area when it comes to moderating what kinds of images should and shouldn't be allowed, so for the time being I'm letting the voting system (i.e. you) tackle them.

Now we need your help.  Today we ran into a bit of a snag when it comes to comics.  [This is the second most popular post currently](http://www.reddit.com/r/Tribes/comments/s7olz/buying_skins_in_tribes_ascend_according_to/), and is a comic (duh).  I didn't see it early enough to take action, nor was it reported or called out in the comments.  I did however see [this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/Tribes/comments/s8cb2/every_god_damn_time/) early on, which did get called out in the comments, and I felt it appropriate to remove.  Now obviously there's a contradiction here.  Should *all* comics, whether memes or not, be removed?  If so, I will remove the CAD post as well.

What about technical support posts, or scoreboards?

Any other comments/suggestions are welcome, as always.

**Stuff I forgot:** 

*  *Please* take technical issues to the [official forums](http://forum.hirezstudios.com/phpbb/viewforum.php?f=314&amp;sid=1cbcba2e16b77b712e3936ed9830e00e).  You will likely get a response from a dev, and they will be alerted of the issue as well.

I had played t2 until the day I heard Ascend was going to be around.  Naturally being as big of a fan as i am, I would expect  to make purchases in-game...  until i actually looked at the prices.  I'm not necessarily wary about spending money and at this time in my life, I am playing multiple games that all involve spending money.  But the problem is, i don't have the availability to play as much as most ..so using EXP for gear is probably not going to happen. Plus when its 100000 exp for a single item that turns me off near instantly.  I can play this game for its existence with the bolt launcher alone so I don't care what happens really, but if HiRez wants that much money for not that much content then I am disappointed. And you can bet your ass I wont be supporting  by buying the ridiculously overpriced gear(not cool because i would like to support).  At this rate, they are going to continue release small content every so often at an inflated price because idiots buy it anyways. Sadly Id rather waste my money on anything other than  these classes and weaponry.  I love tribes but this isn't going to be a cash cow, so to quit over-pricing things would be extremely beneficial.

**100-150 dollars for core weapons sounds terrible to me,  and im not even that tight with my money**

**edit**  Didn't expect that much attention from this rant and i feel better knowing I am not the only person out there who is thinking like this.  I am always a tribes fan through and through and have nothing but high hopes for HiRez.

It's been said before, but I'll say it again: Hi-Rez listens to the tribes community.  After the shit-storm that happened after the jackal and plasma gun updates they learned to test and balance the weapons so that they fitted into the game better.

You can also use your explosive weapons to blast it into some miserable corner.  Every (decent) capper knows how to hit the stand and getting to leave it somewhere else for a bit is amazingly helpful.  Just keep your eyes on any approaches and return it if you see someone coming.  Returning it right away is often a bad idea in a pub when the whole team ditches the stand to go chase and no one is left to prevent an immediate retake.

I play chaser a lot and can often just time a nitron to make the capper drop our flag the second he touches it.  This means the flag is often sitting right next to the base in perfect position to get knocked somewhere weird and be easily defended.  This applies x1000 when the flag is off the stand and in the ship on crossfire.  Stick it in a corner and it will be almost impossible to take until it returns automatically.

It doesn't always need to be left out in a pub, but some times you can get the flag in a great location and it just makes too much sense to return.  I know this is likely preaching to the choir here, but hopefully some will see it who haven't thought of it before.

**Edit:** Should have mentioned this originally (and others have said in comments), but in addition to watching for enemy cappers coming its really important to keep an eye on your own cappers location.  Keeping it too long and giving the enemy an opportunity to recover is a huge mistake (especially considering cappers will often be waiting on the stand hoping you return and will be vulnerable).  On the other hand, returning it right as he flies in is an amazing move that can all but guarantee a cap.

Personally, I err on the conservative side of this tactic and will return a lot of flags that are in a valley far away (usually because I'm a sitting duck if someone sneaks up on me and I'm much more dangerous at the base with full nitrons [Side note: K is suicide]).  However if the capper is killed / conc'd right in the base there is *always* somewhere indoors or at least an obstruction that is a hugely advantageous place to stick the flag.

In the last 3 months you and I have had some awesome times, some serious growing pains, some disasters, some triumphs. There are 13000 of you subscribed to this reddit, thousands more yet that lurk. 

At all turns, I have been humbled by this game and this community. The combined knowledge, support, vitriol, dedication, passion and character of you guys is what makes me proud to be associated with Tribes. 

I have waited my entire life to be able to talk about Tribes. I cajoled every sleepover, every high school computer lab session; begging my friends to ""Download Tribes, lets play! Its the best game!!"" Only to have everyone rage quit over rocket turrets.

But our collective dream is here. We have a major tournament for Tribes, being played in LAN, with a huge audience. We have personalities, we have drama, we have the most talented and coordinated FPS teams imaginable playing for 5 figures.

This the biggest, best, baddest Tribes game, buzz, event to date. I promise I will leave it all on the caster desk for you. I'll continue to give every moment I have to this franchise that is more precious to me than any other.

Many of us have shared this conversation and this dream. I implore you, tweet, link, share and help. This is our chance to show the world why Tribes is the very best in FPS gaming. Ever. Period.

Hello, my name is HHHHHHHHHHHHHHH.
     
     
My Tribes account was wrongfully banned on 4/17/2013.
     
     
On the same day, I found out through a friend that HiRezAPC live streamed the entire ban process. Dumbfounded, I went through the VOD to see what I was banned for, and what “evidence” was used against me. It turned out that HiRezAPC had spectated me for about two minutes and determined that I was using a hotkey to toggle my camera view between enemy players 
     
     
After reviewing the footage, I really have no idea how HiRezAPC came to this conclusion. I now ask you, the reader, to review the footage yourself.
     
     
[Here is the evidence used to ban my account.
    ](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83nSRUQUWx0)
     
     
Clearly, the offending camera movements and target acquisitions are far from bot level precision, speed, or congruency.
     
     
[Here is an example of someone actually cheating](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RNPQI3AJMw)
     
     
In this video, the hacker’s camera instantly snaps to each enemy player with perfect precision every time. Quite obviously, these characteristics are not present in my game play.
     
     
However, I still do get quite a few hack accusations while playing on public servers. The typical accusation mainly boils down to me having a silly name while using an automatic. On some occasions though, I have even been accused of hacking or using a smurf account by high ranked comp/pug players. Similarly, it mostly comes down to me having decent chain and dueling skills without participating or being known in the competitive community.
    
     
Within a week of my ban, I submitted an appeal which included all the relevant information to Hi-Rez support. I also had a respected community member personally talk to HiRezAPC and vouch for me. Still, I’ve gone over a month without a response from Hi-Rez. As a result, I’ve decided to make my ban issue public and let the community review my appeal.

6/18 Update: My account has been unbanned.

As a bonus I will force you to read my thoughts on HoFing (you lucky guys and gals).


**For New HoFers**

Welcome to the joy of watching paint dry!

In all seriousness your first several games being Heavy on Flag (HoF) will probably be very boring and frustrating. That is normal and expected.  Unlike most of the roles in T:A yours is very dependent on the rest of your team especially your defense doing their jobs.  You will not win the game that is what the cappers do, you will keep your team from losing though.

In terms of what you need to HoF there are three unlocks you need to get:

1. Dombringer
2. Super Heavy
3. Mines

In that order, anything else is icing on the cake

The rules of the HoF that you must live by:

1.  You and that flag are now BFFs.  Never leave the flag.  Never chase a flag carrier or try to take out that one really annoying raider.  You will lose the flag.
2. Please refer to rule #1  That is your job plain and simple.  It is neither fast nor glamorous but it is what you do.

Now go look up some videos on how to HoF.  There are some great guides out there watch them and learn what works for you and what doesn't.  Relax have fun and enjoy waching your body get blow across the stand on drydock.

**Gameplay Hints**

Once you see a capper coming in take a few steps back from the flag.  This will let you adjust for their approach a little bt more.  And protect you from the knock back they are going to try and put on you.  (Added detail to balmung135's post)

Another [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Tribes/comments/t3k58/my_thoughts_on_hofing_with_stand_illustrations/c4jacke) by balmung135 as to what to do while idle. (TIL it is not knitting)

The saber is not very good but on some maps can be used to spot incoming cappers (That my idea yo)



**Notes on equipment**

* Forcefields (FF) are there to direct traffic not protect you or kill all the cappers.  Hymnosi has some great points on forcefield usage in his [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Tribes/comments/t3k58/my_thoughts_on_hofing_with_stand_illustrations/c4j9upo) on how to better use the Forcefield.  The key takeaway is that FFs are not to be relied upon as your main defensive mechanic.

* Chaingun is generally considered the best.  Lordsovot has made some great points in his [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Tribes/comments/t3k58/my_thoughts_on_hofing_with_stand_illustrations/c4j9zfv) towards the use of the HeavyBolt Launcher (HBL) which merit further investigation.

* Mine all the routes.  Nothing feels as good as being killed respawning and hearing the sting of announcements and the kill notification of a capper being killed by your mines.

**Stand illustrations**
Sorry for the poor quality of the pics it was the best I could do.

Arx Novena 

Map Notes:
Overall a well designed stand with a range of cppaing routes.  As a HoF you can learn to mitigate them through use of shields and mines making it more about the skill of the cappers vs. the skill of the HoF in terms of who will get the flag.  Midfield Mortar spam can be annoying but is not that big of an issue on this map. 

[Arx Top down view](http://i.imgur.com/SfgzT.jpg)
This was actually borrowed from another HoFers image and has worked really well for me.  I will see if I can track down his link and give him proper credit.  Front to back and Back to Front routes are by far the most common in PUGs placing the mines on the roof tiles has been very effective at finishing off or severely crippling a capper.  The field helps heard cappers towards certain approaches cutting down your areas to cover. **There is a mine on the left roof tile section as well I apparently did not label**

[Arx Tunnel](http://i.imgur.com/ZUYgZ.jpg)  If you have the time drop a mine at the moth of each tunnel next to the little lip offered by the door frame.  Truthfully this has killed more stand harassers than cappers in my games which makes it a god send.  A force field in the tunnel really discourages the side to side.


Crossfire

Map Notes:
It's close proximity to the generator mean you will be taking heat from the get go.  4 primary path directions makes it pretty easy to predict Capper routes.  The small area of the stand does make it a trick for keeping up your defensive equipment with the near constant shelling and harassment.  Mortar spam from near your ship is very common and makes life pretty crappy with no help.

[Crossfire Top Down](http://i.imgur.com/L8aT8.jpg)
Thanks to the ship side to side routes are the most common, the mines placed like this are hard for a capper to take out and will hurt if not out right kill most.

[Crossfire Isometric](http://i.imgur.com/5B3fI.jpg) I like to place a mine just inside the door as well as a shield inside this more or less stops the front to back and back to front routes as well as providing a small amount of protection from the constant stand haters.


Dry Dock

Map Notes:
Learn to love the respawn timer screen.  The proximity to base entrances as well as the 3 seperate high ground Mortar spam stand surrounding your base means you will be dead far more than you will be alive.  The open flag stand provides for a massive number of routes making your job even harder.  I hate this map.

[Dry Dock Top Down](http://i.imgur.com/B0YiW.jpg)
Don't set any of your defenses near the flag; it will just get blown up faster than you can reset it.  Instead place your mines on the exit direction of the routes the enemy cappers are using.


Katabatic

Map Notes:
Mortar spam friendly this map is another unpleasant one to be HoF especially if you have no help on non gen defense.  The routes are pretty easy to pick up from a distance and you can adapt your mines and shields as you see fit.

[Katabatic Top Down](http://i.imgur.com/l6reX.jpg)  Use the force field to mitigate the easier routs as well as heard the cappers on to your mines.  You may consider putting a mine on the ramp and a second field if you have time in side the building up the ramp to discourage the side to side routes.


Raindance

Map Notes:  With only side to side routes available this map is deceptively easy to defend.  Mortar spam from the hill to your right will be a constant cause of grief.  The small size of the stand also makes it very easy for cappers to remove your defenses.

[Raindance Top Down](http://i.imgur.com/nKnhf.jpg) Spread your mines out and use the force field to cover the side coming from your base.  There is a harder to hit route that hugs the side of the tower and mitigates most mine placements so use your field to stop that shit.  The only nice thing to say about this stand is it is pretty easy to get out of the call-in strike attacks by  stepping in the building quickly and stepping back out.


Sunstar

Map Notes:  If the gen is up this is a HoFers dream, if the gen is down this is crossfire 2.0 with a crappier sized stand.  With a good Defense this one of the rare maps where you will feel in control of the flag.  Offense will have to attack fro m a fairly small range of angles which allows you to bring the chain gun to bear against them.  This Stand can make you feel like a god or a noob.  Just depends on your team.

[Sunstar Top Down](http://i.imgur.com/nFVQF.jpg) I killed the gen to make it more clear, if the gen is down you can keep the same config just be prepared for a wider range of routes and constant mortar spam.  Once again the force field is used more to heard rather than kill.the mines place in such a way that a capper will have to hit one regardless of route direction.  Once you figure out which routes they are using you may place a mine on of the ramps to hit them as they enter or exit.


Temple Ruins

Map Notes: A lot of people hate it, I actually like it.  You have some shelter from mortar spam, the columns force a few very high speed routes.  Get in place quickly because you will be getting cappers in quick.

[Temple Ruins Top Down](http://i.imgur.com/2jA1D.jpg)  Mine placement is still a work in progress but I use the columns to try and protect them as much as I can.  Field placement will vary game to game, if you are getting a lot of cappers coming down the ramp place a field there.  Because genhater have to go past you to get to the gen room expect a lot of collateral hate to spewed your way.

Have to say I didn't publish on Smite Reddit because mods applies some kind of strong Censorship against bad feedback to Hi-Rez, so they just deleted it from there.

This was originally made for Smite users, so I adapted the text to fit with all Hi-Rez games.

First of all

I have contacted and noticed about this to:

1. Todd Harris, Hi-Rez COO
2. Support
3. Some Hi-Rez Workers

I had an answer from Todd Harris, but he ignored all the content I sent, didn't talk about this and just told me Cheating is bad and they are against that.

Summary
---

The Tribes/Smite/GA EULA states Hi-Rez has the right to monitor for blacklist software while the game is open. Evidence has shown that Hi-Rez monitors your computer for blacklist software even when Tribes/Smite/GA is closed, which violates the agreement in the EULA.

---
**If you want more information, or you just want evidence, continue reading**

---
Evidence
---

Video: https://vimeo.com/70404546

Video Summary: This video shows that running blacklist software while Smite is closed will ban your IP address from the Tribes/Smite/GA servers.

Steps from the video: http://pastebin.com/BCFYgcgW

Tip: Video was made when i knew almost nothing about this process, I thought it was only banning your IP, that's why you may find the video doesn't fit with some new text. Also, didn't repeat it because I had to ""suicide"" 2 IPs to make the video.

---
More Info
---

After some investigation, I found the following.

    HiPatchService auto starts when your computer boots and scans for blacklisted software until you shut it down.
    All this process info is hidden and they don't allow us to stop it from launcher.
    The process says ""In pause"" on the process list when you're out of Tribes/Smite/GA, but it still scans your computer. 
    It keeps using memory, it's not really paused.

---
From the Tribes/Smite/GA EULA,
---

**Consent to Monitor. WHEN RUNNING**, HI-REZ MAY MONITOR YOUR USE AND PLAY OF THE SOFTWARE PRODUCT AND COLLECT DATA REGARDING YOUR USE AND PLAY OF THE SOFTWARE PRODUCT IN ACCORDANCE WITH HI-REZ’S PRIVACY POLICY, A CURRENT COPY OF WHICH MAY BE ACCESSED AT http://legal.hirezstudios.com.

---
Conclusion
---

Be careful of what programs you chose to run on your computer if you have Hi-Rez games installed. It may trigger a ban of your IP address and accounts associated with that IP.

Also, any ban made under this circumstance, makes it an illegal ban, and the account/IP should be unbaned.

Tribes Ascend could have been huge, and it was certainly on the right track, but they dropped the ball just when they were about to get the touchdown. So terribly sad.

HiRez is similiar to SOE in this way.  Talented devs ran by complete morons who don't know how to cultivate what they have.

They're a niche gaming company trying to behave like a general audience company, it just isn't going to work.

If you want a good example of a company that understands what it means to be a niche company, look at Bohemia Interactive, Egosoft, and Digital Extremes.


HiRez, please sell the IP to someone else. Please. You've already got an incredibly bad reputation from this move.  Not many knew your name before, and were largely considered a potentially good company, now everyone knows that HiRez is a company that should be avoided.

What did you expect from Tribes Ascend? Call of Duty like profits?  You got too greedy too quickly, with super expensive gear, and intentionally OP weapons on their release.  You should have spent your time cultivating rather than making the quick buck.

You're a new company, you should have spent time cultivating a community of fans, rather than abandoning what little fanbase you had left after countless fumbles.


You did this with Global Agenda, and you did it with Tribes: Ascend.  I feel bad for Smite players, because you're going to do it to them too.

Have some fucking patience, and respect for your customers.

We will be releasing funds for the Summer of Tribes events this week!
Basically, the deal is that we are a tiny company! This is not a cash flow issue it is a personnel one :)

The same people that are processing payment are directly involved in game and event operations. Believe it or not, eSports is not just me at the studio :D

Many of you have reached out to me for information about payment processing and unfortunately I did not have a concrete answer to give.

Some of the money has been paid out already by the time of this post to the various organizations. I can confirm payment this week for outstanding ESL, NASL, FPSGi and Qcon tournaments.
Now on to gold. Basically the same deal when it comes to being busy and multitasking this among other things,however, that is all on me.

Gold will flow from my internet browser today/this week.

Team captains : Please keep a look out for emails/irc pms regarding your rosters! The gold will either come as a list of codes or directly added to the player's accounts in question!

Finally, please allow me to apologize for the untimely payment. Secondly, please bear with us as we work through our first major season of competition/eSports events! This is a learning process on our end and I can guarantee you we harbor no ill-will towards the player base or in paying out these tournaments.

They see his carefully placed mine trails, their set of glimmering, buzzing forcefields, their intimidating, chugging chaingun, and consider the base as good as ironclad.

You cannot leave this man alone.

HoF is one of the most torturous, death-prone positions in many pub games. Juggernauts are far and away the most common heavy seen on pubs, and arguably the most powerful in terms of base offense. Their mortar can take us out in two shots, and remove our static defenses in one. Even pathfinders can simply spam at us from what is essentially an unreachable distance for even the few of us who choose to use a bolt launcher. Strikes can remove us at a moment's notice, while kamikaze brutes and raiders essentially clear the flag stand for up to 30 seconds - more than enough for cappers to slip by.

The point is - We. Are. Limited. We are not your one stop shop for flag defense, and no, technicians camping gens or wandering around the base not daring to step outside do not help the situation.

What we NEED to be effective is people in mid. Applying pressure, softening or killing kamikazes before they get close, chasing off spamming cappers, killing off strike targeters before they can finish the lock on, and destroying jugs who try to spam.

All it takes is one or two considerate people to ensure that a flag will never leave your stand. Please, help your local HoF today.",,False,self,t5_2rdsl,False,,BE,True,t3_s1xq0,http://www.reddit.com/r/Tribes/comments/s1xq0/psa_when_an_hof_is_on_your_team_you_need_to_kill/,

There are no major dev updates planned for Tribes: Ascend in the next six months.

For the next six months our primary development focus is SMITE.  Beyond that it is GA2.  And beyond that a TA2 would be more likely than a major update to TA; but to be clear no devs are currently working toward TA2.

Per the development blog on our forums, the recent TA work has been Kate developing some additional maps.  If time allows then these new TA maps (along with some bug-fixes) would be finalized and deployed but no committed date yet.   

We continue to support TA servers, online community events, tournaments with prizing, bringing Tribes to offline events like recent RTX and upcoming QuakeCon, and live-streaming.

1340318283.0,178,self.Tribes,vem00,Tribes Ascend Update #6: Stonehenge (Version 1.0.1016),201,23,209,http://www.reddit.com/r/Tribes/comments/vem00/tribes_ascend_update_6_stonehenge_version_101016/,"Tribes Ascend Version 1.0.1016 is expected to be deployed on Friday, June 22. The servers will be down for several hours while the patch is deployed. Below are the preliminary patch notes.

**Major Highlights**

* Added support for “lock to player view” while spectating players. This allows you to see what the spectated player target sees. Press ‘L’ by default to lock the view to the player’s viewpoint. Mousewheel in for a first-person perspective.
* A new TDM map has been added to the list of maps in the Quick Play rotation.  (Miasma)
* A new CTF map has been added to the list of maps available to play on Custom Servers. Stonehenge is a remap of a classic Tribes map. The map is currently in a “beta” state and will be added to the Quick Play rotation after it goes through testing on Custom Servers.

**Weapon/Balance Items**

* The Pathfinder’s Light Assault Rifle will now fire bursts from just holding down the fire button, rather than having to repress the fire button for each burst.
* Increased Rage Perk activation radius by 50%.
* Decreased effect radius of Raider’s Whiteout grenade by roughly 8%.
* Decreased damage on Shrike Rockets by 22%.
* Increased Shrike Rocket damage to armored targets (ex. base turrets, beowulfs) by 30%.
* Decreased damage on Technician’s Rockwind SMG by roughly 8%
* Slightly increased the distance from the reticule required for the Spotted command to work.
* Increased the distance Raider’s EMP grenades can be thrown to match most other grenades.
* Decreased explosion radius on Pathfinder’s Compact Nitrons by 13%.
* The Phase Rifle’s downscope reticule has been tweaked and crosshairs added.
* Raindance: A new route has been added into the generator room.

**Additional Items**

* With the help of community feedback, we have reworked some of the mechanics of the emergent gameplay of “rock-bouncing.” The mechanic is more lenient than the last major patch:
* Bouncing off a rock at an extreme angle is possible again, but the player will lose some of their speed.
* The “grace angle” for a bounce that loses no speed has been widened
* We will continue to adjust this feature as needed.
* FIxed an issue where some Accolades were not being awarded with some of the new variant weapons.
* Fixed an issue where the Determination Perk was not applying its health boost correctly.
* Fixed a situation where XP was not being given if the player had left the match early.
* Fixed an issue where a player could zoom and fire with weapons that don’t allow zooming while firing by holding down zoom through a reload sequence.
* Fixed bug where the Raider’s NJ5 Reload and Retrieve sounds were not playing.
* Fixed bug where the Infiltrator’s Remote Arx Buster Reload and Retrieve sounds were not playing.
* Tartarus High intensity music added.
* Fixed an issue where the Rage Perk would sometimes not apply when it should have.
* Fixed an issue where Technician’s Long Range Repair tool was repairing vehicles too quickly.
* Fixed an issue where rapid projectile fire wasn’t replicating to a spectator viewing the player who was firing.
* Fixed an issue on Deal of the Day that was incorrectly showing an XP tag.
* Fixed an issue with the Twitch streams that was causing not all of the active players to be shown.

I love the game. Been playing for damn near a year. (July 11th, 2012). I just recently hit LvL 46 (and a 1/2).

I never played a multiplayer online only game before. Usually just the AAA titles, single player plus DLC's and then move on. But, since I started T:A, I have found myself coming back over and over again, usually not even starting or finishing other games.

Sad, I know. 

Now, on to a darker note. :( 

As of now, we have gone 100 days since the last patch/update. I realize that HiRez has other priorities on their plate. But, c'mon, seriously. This is getting to be too much. 

At the beginning of the year, all this hype surrounding what was to come, has all but diminished. All the high hopes are all but lost. I am actually starting to feel neglected.

From what we have been told, there are maps on the way. Two (2) maybe, three (3). Possible bug fixes, optimization, content, who knows? It's a secret, we know. 

I just don't understand, why a Nominated Game of the Year. Just seems like it's getting shoved aside for something else. Many would say it's a niche game. But that only came true, with the diminishing Dev Support.

It has all the capabilities of being the world's greatest game (I don't care what others may say concerning past titles in the series). I played the others, just recently. To be honest. (IMO) T:A is far superior, and could easily blow the doors off any other game currently on the market. My opinions of course. (I know I will receive, quite a bit of Heat for that comment). But, it's my opinion. 

I thought you HiRez, were going to dedicate a small team, to keep working out bug fixes, adding content (maps, skins, Voice packs, etc...). So, what happened? Why has such a Grand Title (Franchise), taken the back burner? (I know about Smite, and I don't care). It still does not make sense to me.

After all the praise that T:A has received, why steer off in another direction? I know you lost players around the same time I started. I heard about all the controversy. But, I thought you were pushing past that.

We have seen the videos of you HiRez, stating that T:A will forever be supported, that it is NOT a one hit wonder, hit-it and quit-it sort of brand for you. But, that doesn't seem to be the case. At least at this point.

I do apologize for writing this, I just feel that maybe you need to hear this. How much you affect us all. How much we want this to succeed. Ideas have been posted too many times to count. About how you can still push this game even further. Making it even more successful than ever before. (Bug fixes, Maps, Customization options (Skins, Colors for Jet Trails, Weapons, Discs, Armors), Armor variants, etc...)

But yet, Nothing. Still.

To be honest, I was expecting more. 

At least One map per month, wouldn't be asking too much. As well as, a skin per month. But, that's on the low end. 

It should be one map per month of each game type (two (2) for CTF). Plus two or more skins (customization options). After all, that's how you attain revenue. Correct? It's a Free-2-Play game. You should be adding more, all the time, keeping players interested. Unlocks at different levels, Armor variants once hit certain levels (Achievements). Colors, showing you are High Level (skins for weapons, Armor). Like every other Free-2-Play title. 

They make money for a reason. Cause they get back what they put in, and then some.

I love this game, I will keep playing. It draws me back over and over again, no matter what. As long as there are servers, I will play.

Just re-think your strategy, please.

Please get back on track with your Transparency Model. Launch the Public Test Servers for us to give feedback on what Kate and anyone else has been working on. Dedicate a small team, to support T:A, more so, than what we have been seeing.

Show us why you were nominated as a Game of the Year. Live up to all the hype that surrounded this game when launched. And more... 

From: A Huge Fan, just asking for more of his favorite title.

Tribes:Ascend FTW!

[EVA1]EVOLiTiLE 

*

I know I sound like a whiny little B, sh!t I don't care. I love this Fucking Game!

*

(TL:DR) More Maps/Content, More Transparency as Promised, Make PTS live again, Show us you give a Damn!

About a year ago, I was in a very, very dark place. I already hated my life, I would get home from work with nothing to look forward to doing. Every day was ""just another day"". (Cold weather doesn't give a lot to do at night when you're the outdoorsy type). This basically led to me being laid off and my girlfriend dumping me. I don't blame them....I would have done the same with me back then. 

Obviously this didn't help my outlook on everything...I don't need to state the obvious here, do I?

Anyway, then a friend of mine comes along, and says ""hey, remember Tribes from back in the day? They came out with a new one!"". I was skeptical about the changes, but I figured, what the hell, it's free to try right? 

So I downloaded it and fired it up. It took a while....but after a couple hours I found myself having more fun than I'd had in a video game in probably 10 years. I finally had something to look forward to when I came home at night (luckily I had found a new job about two weeks after I was laid off). I would literally spend time daydreaming about flying around in the Tribes universe. I finally had something to be passionate about. 

TLDR: It would not be a stretch of the imagination to say that Tribes Ascend saved my life. Is this story a bit pathetic? Yeah....I suppose it is. But I figured I'd share anyway. 

Life is good now....and yes, I'm still playing Tribes.

VGW. 




Edit:

Just so people understand my situation:  I'm not ""clinically"" depressed, I was diagnosed with S.A.D. (btw....whoever doubts whether this is a real thing can go fuck themselves). It was almost like the perfect storm of the time of year, a crappy job, a cunt of a girlfriend, getting used to life in the real world, and not having a sport to get in shape for, so it was my first winter without regular strenuous exercise on top of it all. I look back on it all now and have to shake my head at how I was a year ago.

I live in the Middle East, so the US servers were terribly laggy for me (250+), but the EU servers were tolerable ( 100-150 ). I still see my spinfusors fly right through enemies without damage, and get hit by explosions that I think I've dodged, but it's still fun.

I unlocked all the classes except Brute, and then decided to just try and master one. I found chasing to be interesting but because automatic weapons are so difficult to use with lag, I find myself using the pathfinder to annoy and harass more than chasing.

Then I tried practicing with the Juggernaut. Oh man. When you land a long range artillery shot and clip someone skiing past. Incredible. I tried timing one of my flag stand harass mortar shots, and managed to blow up the incoming flag carrier juuuuust before he capped. The only thing missing was someone standing by me so I could high five them.

Deal of the day gave me the MIRV, and now no flag stand is safe :D Every day I'm getting better and better at landing shots while moving faster and faster, and that's what I love about this game. You Sentinels may enjoy standing there picking off targets a mile away, but I've found a peculiar enjoyment in flying past a flag stand at 160-170 sanics and leaving them a couple of explosive presents. :D",,False,self,t5_2rdsl,False,,,True,t3_tgahl,http://www.reddit.com/r/Tribes/comments/tgahl/learning_feels_so_good_in_this_game/,

There are a number of things in the next patch, including our largest to date re-balancing of the weapons (driven based on feedback directly taken from a council of competitive players). We will also be introducing a large number of new weapons, which are essentially variants of existing weapons, giving people more options to find weapons that fit their exact preferred playstyle. And there are a couple new maps.

Perhaps the biggest change, especially for newer players, is that we are introducing new ways to improve and speed player advancement (based on feedback from the community).

With the next patch, you will no longer spend XP on weapon and armor upgrades. Each weapon, pack, perk, and armor class will progress automatically towards their upgrades as you play with them equipped.

This is greatly to your advantage, as you can simultaneously progress many items in your loadout (up to 7), and save all of the XP you earn for unlocks such as new weapons and new perks. In general this will significantly increase how quickly you earn unlocks in the game.

Think of it as each item having their own little progression bar, and as you play it fills up and gives you free unlocks, until you master a weapon. The progression on weapons is based on your ending match XP (think of it as duplicating that value to each weapon), so it is increased by performance, boosting, first win of the day, and badge earning.

Some important things to consider:

- Any upgrades you have purchased prior to the upgrade will remain purchased.

*EDITED
- When the patch is live, how you acquire upgrades will change. For most users the smart path will be to simply play the weapon. As you do so, you will automatically upgrade. For those that have excess XP, there will be an option to immediately master the weapon at any point using XP.
/EDITED*

- When the patch is live, you will no longer be able to acquire upgrades with saved XP, and your progression on your next weapon upgrades will start from the beginning for that particular upgrade.

If there are upgrades you wish to have immediately unlocked, it's recommended you purchase them now. Otherwise, you will have to start progression toward your next unlock from the starting point for that unlock. Keep in mind, though, that you may wish to save all of your XP now with the knowledge that future unlocks will happen automatically on the weapons you wish to play with.

We are excited about this change and are excited to hear your feedback and concerns.

Thanks,
Stew

**Update on the Gigapatch**

HiRezStew: We can look at a path to immediately master a weapon using XP (regardless of how much you have mastered it to date).

Ref: http://forum.hirezstudios.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=234&amp;t=73546&amp;p=930441#p930441


**Update2 on the Gigapatch**

HiRezStew: Edited original post. We'll add a single button to master the weapon using XP.

The concern of having this has mostly been just around causing confusion for new users. The new system is nice in its simplicity in that you simply play the weapon and you earn upgrades, and you have to make fewer choices around whether to spend newly earned XP on upgrades to existing weapons, or to acquire new stuff.

I'm sure many of you have noticed the resemblance between ""hirez APC"" and the pop singer Justin Timberlake, this is not a coincidence, and for some reason, whenever the question is asked, it is shut down immediately by hirez and even apc himself. [Source](http://i.imgur.com/bawKBPr.png?1)


I think if I just try to tell you all that apc and Justin Timberlake are the same person, it might not be as convincing as arriving at the truth yourself. So I will leave you with these photos I gathered in my extensive research. And keep in mind, that Justin Timberlake only appears in 1 of these photos, the rest are Apc, take from this what you will.

I am hoping as many mono players can comment on this as possible without putting themselves at risk, maybe even bart could shed some light on this all. Good night and God bless.

This was my first scrim with Tao, this was pre-sentinel respawn timer increase, meant to spark discussion about sentinel respawn timer values and other balance issues. This is also relevant to the rest of the thread, because we were meant to scrim apc's team, deadstop at the time, but apc could not make it. This was all during a huge touring event for Justin Timberlake in Europe. Coincidence? That's for you to decide.

1341969641.0,154,self.Tribes,wczjs,My plea to Hi-Rez to release mapping tools,204,50,87,http://www.reddit.com/r/Tribes/comments/wczjs/my_plea_to_hirez_to_release_mapping_tools/,"[Link to Hi-Rez forum post](http://forum.hirezstudios.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=313&amp;t=80059)

This has probably been posted before, but I think it needs to get attention of Hi-Rez and they NEED to listen.

One of the best things that Tribes had for it in previous titles, especially Tribes 2, was the community. We are the ones who will make or break your game. We give you your money. We can leave whenever we want. OR.... we will stay and play and have a great time.

The time we spend here is valuable to us. We want to have fun and have a great time. And in the time we spend here and play the game, we find things that are good, some that are bad, and occasionally those ideas create inspiration. It is in that inspiration that brings me to the topic of this post.

The community has MANY good/great/downright terrible ideas for mapping. I often read posts or hear people talk about ""the flags need to be indoors"" or ""No, they need to be OUTDOORS!"" and even ""wouldn't it be great if the bases were designed like...."" and you get the idea. One of the things that kept Tribes 2 alive for so long was the custom maps. And let me tell you; There were a lot of great maps. Entire servers were dedicated to a custom lineup. Houston Vehicles? Great maps with huge ceilings where the bases were in the sky and you had to use vehicles (shrikes, bombers, tanks on bridges, and yes, the Havok [oh where are thou?]) to move around the map. You could still jetpack platform to platform, but if you fell off, you died when you hit the ground. These maps wouldn't have been possible without the creativity and inspiration from the community. And these servers were ALWAYS full. Why? Because the maps were fun to play on. And the server admins knew this, so they had popular maps in rotation.

So, I ask again Hi-Rez, why haven't you given us the tools to make these maps? DO NOT give me the excuse ""because they are too hard/complex for the community to use"" or something similar. We might surprise you. There were dedicated map makers back in the day and I am sure some of them are still here. New ones will emerge. All you have to do is trust us to make you content. I am sure we would even do it for FREE. Give us a chance to surprise you with the ideas we have for the maps we want to play on.

Now comes the slightly harder part of implementation. Yes, some work would have to go into a way to provide these maps to the servers, as Hi-Rez hosts them all and has total control. I think the obvious and easy way would be to have a community based map archive, similar to how starcraft 2 maps are released (http://www.starcraft2maps.net/ for example) and then allow private or custom servers to download/upload maps to their servers. Security could possibly be a concern, but I am sure there are ways around that. Another option would be to have some sort of a review process where maps are uploaded directly to Hi-Rez where they can then implement the maps that they find ""acceptable"" but this could lead to a large amount of maps that will get thrown out for whatever reason and never heard from again. I think the former option is more ideal, but I will let the community decide.

I know you will have concerns that this will make your maps obsolete or inferior in some way or another. But you can still make your maps as you see fit, and the community can then have their maps of choice, and you can even have a system in place where a map is ""featured"" or something. I don't know exactly, there are plenty of ways to do this. Hi-Rez can even look at which maps are popular and get an idea of WHY these maps are popular. It is a win-win as it will give the community what they want, and valuable data Hi-Rez can use in future map design.

Basically it comes down to this, Hi-Rez. We want the tools. You want control. (and possibly jobs?) Give us the opportunity to prove to you how dedicated we are to the success of this game. Let us not only tell you what we want, but actually SHOW you with an actual product of our imagination. The details of how this can be accomplished can be worked out.

All I am calling for is a ""Call to action"" of sorts. I may not speak for everyone, but I will still try an make MY voice heard. However, I am only 1 person, and I can only do so much.

The huge list of little improvements which could make the game so much better.

Well it's been a while since we had one of these threads, so I decided to make a list of all the little things which frustrate me.  Individually, they aren't so bad.  But when you stack them up like this, well...  See for yourself.  This is all my OPINION, so you might think differently and are welcome to tell me why I am wrong about things.  I might add your suggestions to this so it's all in one place.

**Tiny improvements - probably only need to alter one variable or something.**

* More Loadout slots.  Hell, make them infinite and only the first nine are able to be hotkeyed.  There should be nine anyway, why are we restricted to six?  Hi-rez could even make each new loadout more expensive to unlock, if they want cash...

* Allow us to use the mouse wheel for menus.  This is 2013, not 1995.  EVERYONE has a wheel now.

* Vehicle selection hotkeys.  1, 2, 3 to choose gravcycle, shrike, beowulf.  Or make it ascending price order, as in grav on top, shrike on bottom so that 1 is always gravcycle, 2 is always beowulf, and 3 is shrike for lights/mediums.

* Allow us to mute peoples VGS spam, but not their written text.

* Let us COMPLETELY mute people, forever.  That means we don't have to use the ridiculously bad mute functions every time we are in the same game as those muppets.

* Re-work the ridiculously bad mute, votekick, and report functions.  Turn on some sort of autocomplete for each player in the current game, like we have for people in our friendslist.

* Lower the threshold required for a successful votekick.  And make it so that everyone who doesn't vote, votes yes or is prompted more forcefully to vote.  I think you can actually change an in-game setting which makes the votekick poll not show up.  From  /u/BadVVolf : Make only the people who voted count towards a kick, e.g. it requires 50% of the people who voted to say yes for a successful kick.

* No respawn timer for roaming map gamemode.

* Bigger indicator of where the flag is when someone grabs.  Not some little icon that goes BEHIND all my HUD stuff.

* Remove the health upgrades for each armour.  This just puts new players at even more of a disadvantage against current players, since they have less health than everybody else.

* Save our server browser settings.  Favorites are nice, but the browser could be improved.



**Small improvements - Stuff that should have been done, but isn't too important** 

* A different loading screen for each map.

* Custom crosshair support.

* Fix the spectator thing to show proper weapons, perks and ammo.  Also give the first-person spec some crosshairs and the gun models, so it looks like an actual first person perspective.

* A ping-delay for the target practice mode.  Would make it actually relevant.  Note that this would be a number you put into your machine to delay each shot, not that Hi-rez would host the training map on a server...

* separate the VGS spam from the chat text.

* Fix third person mode, especially with regards to heavies.  Also add first person mode for vehicles, it would be nice to see the person I'm shooting at in my shrike.

* 100% inheritance weapon variants for other classes

* Skins!  Shit that you can monetize which has no effect on gameplay!  Vehicle skins!  CAAAAAAPES!!!  The ones we have now are a good start, but there are too few of them and they are waaaay too expensive.  I'm not going to pay $20 for a gold pack which will let me buy ONE of the newer skins.  (950 gold for skin, 1800 gold for $20, you do the math)  Or have custom parts for each class...




**Larger Improvements - Stuff that should have been done**

* Directional Jets.  In addition, make it so we don't have to wobble our arrow keys to gain height, it makes no sense.

* Actual diminishing returns on jet-pack use, i.e. no instant speed cap at 72 kph.  If a quadratic formula is impossible, then make a series of speeds which give decreasing acceleration the faster you go.  E.g:  0-72 = 10 m/s^2 , 72-100 = 8 m/s^2 , 100-125 = 6 m/s^2 ...

* Ability to choose where you spawn, since this has a pretty big impact on some maps (Drydock, Arx, Kata, almost every other map...)

* The chat system.  Why the FUCK DOES IT STILL LOOK LIKE A CONSOLE?  That shit should have been developed during early beta, yet it's been months since release and it still looks like it's alpha dev footage.

* Decent, OBVIOUS (or compulsory, even) tutorials.  Teach new players about inheritance, skiing, impulse jumps, FLAG PLAY, and the actual uses and roles of assets and classes.

* Medium class hitbox size.  Shouldn't they be somewhere in between light and heavy classes?

* Stonehenge.


**Bugs**

* Shrike invincibility - some shots do no damage to shrikes.

* Ping display updates in realtime.

* Server lag, where all of the players complain about warping/ping spikes.  Even if it isn't directly under your control, it's your responsibility to make the server providers fix their internets.

* Classes display the correct skins.  No more sentinel-looking guys running around with titans.

* Getting hit by a pistol shot can interrupt you jump+jet, making you only jet which will get you nowhere.

* Player stats.  Still broken.

* Why does it break when patches are released, requiring a FULL download again?  And it's not an isolated incident, I think most people have had it happen to them, multiple times even.

* Edit: Just saw another one:  When you log in the menu displays the ""Videos"" section titles on each button, but the buttons go to their ordinary places.

* Edit: Fix the flag getting stuck in the other teams booster on blueshift.

* Edit: Fix the crash after disconnection bug.  I only wanted to text my friends, not get booted from the game.

* /u/badvvolf : Fractal grenades sometimes deal far more damage than they should.  EDIT:  Apparently this is what is supposed to happen.  They explode violently on their last beam.

* /u/virtblue : Fix the bug when pressing mouse 1 and two at the same time, only one registers.

* /u/kurukururin : Game crashes if you change the description name of your custom server, and you add more letters or numbers than you should.

**Wishlist - Stuff that I want to happen**

* Demo support.

* Community modding.

* Ability for players to make their own maps, create content for you, etc...

* Some kind of serious or ranked games, with a decent matchmaking system and roles being assigned to each player...

* PLEASE make use of hotfixes more often.  Most of us can live with small bugs for a few days, but when they are still there after 2+ months people get annoyed.  If you break something, fix it!!!  I don't think anybody really cares if they need to download a small patch which fixes everything you broke in the last big update.  

* Re-work the behaviour of vehicles.  No gimble-lock on shrikes, allow us to fly with freedom instead of trying to make it easier to fly.  Remove the angle limit (or at least increase it) for the beowulf, if we want to midair someone with the cannon we should be allowed to.  Also make the vehicles able to climb steep slopes slightly, instead of just deadstopping if you hit a too-steep slope

* Standardised inheritance and speeds for explosive weapons.  Why does the heavy bolt launcher have a slightly lower speed?  It's not different enough to easily tell that it is slower, which means that players have to re-learn how to aim it.  And why do some weapons have 20% inheritance, while others have 50%?  Biggest example is the grenade launcher and arx buster, one has 50% and one has 20% which makes it a pain in the arse to learn.  It would be nice to see some stats for inheritance and projectile speed un der the current range, damage, and ammo stats.

* Vehicle customization.  Stuff like a light-shrike with less health and more speed.  Or a tank that shoots twice as fast but does half the splash damage/radius.  Or a weapon that takes charge time but is hitscan for either vehicle.  Make them viable for offense instead of a support role in defense.  Energy-powered shileds, as /u/RoSoDude suggested.

* Remove saber launchers.  For ""the worlds fastest shooter"" this gun seems a little out of place.  It also sets a bad example for new players in that they think sabers are the best way to kill tanks/shrikes.  And the fact that the lock-on range is way too long makes spotting and annoying cappers far too easy.

* Make repair tools heal on a health per second basis, instead of a % per second.  This makes it take longer for a fully upgraded gen to be repaired, and makes it closer to the time it takes to kill it.  When there's more than two decent TCNs on a team, that team can d-stack for the whole game because it takes almost no time to repair all the base assets.  A MK-4 asset with one tech can out-repair the normal brute spinfusor...

**Other Suggestions**

* /u/jojotmagnificent : OPTIMIZATION.

* /u/evanvolm : UI for muting and kicking players, changing maps, etc.

* /u/Nark51 : No generator auto-repair in roaming gamemodes.

* /u/char1661 : More intelligent bots in target practice running more player-like routes.  Adding to this, maybe some pre-recorded routes for each map in roaming?  Both for new cappers and for new hofs to practice with.

* /u/Pataclocked : Size of the flag icon above a player is proportional to their distance from you.

* /u/VirTW : Havoc.

* /u/BadVVolf : Filter servers out which have a level limit that you can't enter.

* /u/tavarner17 : Create class-specific spawn points to change how effective each class can be for certain roles.  Snipers start in valleys/places with little line-of-sight, pathfinders at the start of routes and soldiers further away to reduce the effectiveness of SLD-capping.

* /u/RoSoDude : General UI, menu, and HUD improvements.  And some more skins. ^^Caaaapes

* /u/blakey 88 : Option to turn off deployable names or reduce their size.  And an option to vote on the map.

* /u/EpsiIonAlpha : Have a slight cooldown on the vehicle entry button so you aren't immediately ejected while spamming it.

* /u/kurukururin : Add a parameter to the custom servers where you can change the time it takes for a player to get kicked for being afk.

* /u/bookreportgrid : The ability to record a route in practice mode, then export that file to other players who could see a ""ghost"" of said route to make learning new routes easier.

* /u/shackleshackleton : Add a custom inheritance slider for weapons.

* /u/Venz_venZ : After a map the chat should be visible somewhere, instead of having to push ~ to get to it.

* /u/tastyham : Add an option to turn off flag drag in training mode.

* /u/tastyham : Physics preset selection for training modes.

* /u/tastyham : Active game clock in training mode.

* /u/chineseimmigrants : More weapon icons in the kill feed.  A knife kill could use a ninja star icon instead of a bullet.  Also show blue plates and air mails.

* /u/therealcreamcheesus : LAN ability.

* /u/Altairi : Distance indicators for both flags at all times, or maybe only when grabbed, or have different options.

* /u/Altairi : Show own flag carrier's health at all times.

* /u/Altairi : Highlight players using VGS, especially for ""Help"" and ""Give me the Flag!"".

* /u/Altairi : Targeting laser.

* /u/blasharga : More customizable settings in menu instead of having us edit the .ini file.

* /u/PUSH_THE_BUTTONS : Player death when snapped to a player in spectator needs to trigger a new free-look state.

* /u/PUSH_THE_BUTTONS : The flag camera will follow the flag back to the stand it came from in the event of a capture. This was ""fixed"" a long time ago but it never fixed the flag camera. The fix only works when you snap to a player from free-look, and then the camera correctly snaps to the stand the capture happened at. Also, the left/right clicks for the flag camera don't always go to a certain team, it changes based on the map.

* **Fix the lag issues** seems to be a pretty vital one, suggested by many people.

* /u/PowerTattie Fix the impulse bugs, where you can disc/nitron behind you and not get the correct impulse added to your speed.

* /u/shreq : 

* Hideable weapon model

* Customizable crosshairs per weapon or weapon group (hitscan, chain including chain pistol like inf, spinfusors, thumpers/bolts/GL, mortars, snipers)

* full bright mode for people with dynamic lights off

* brightness/gamma/contrast settings, console commands or just in the ini

* option for round timer to count up rather than down

* flag distance OSD

* remove gray translucent oval from sniper crosshair

* option to disable OSD icons and text for deployables and base assets

* reintroduce ""stat net"" console command so people can see packetloss, real ping, netspeed etc

* tickrate option for private/passworded servers

* hold-to-fire on all weapons, even while holding down fire early during a reload/weapon change

* different and distinctive sounds for flag events (pick-up, return etc.)

* /u/ihatethissite : Hiding ""Full servers"" also hides over-capacity servers.

* /u/Schottingham : Health kits instead of passive regen, or at least an option to have this on custom servers.

**Table 1:** All unlocks (except unlocking the loadouts themselves) with their GP and XP costs.  A higher XP/GP ratio means it's a more ""efficient"" use of GP. Actual class unlocks (e.x. being able to spawn as a Sentinel) thanks to **skoh**.

1339708797.0,154,self.Tribes,v2bn4,"Hi-Rez and their ""Guilty by Association"" IP bans...",221,67,175,http://www.reddit.com/r/Tribes/comments/v2bn4/hirez_and_their_guilty_by_association_ip_bans/,"On May 27th, 2012, when attempting to log into my account to play Tribes:Ascend, I received a message informing me that the account had been banned. Immediately, I contacted Hi-Rez Studios' support team to inquire about their reasoning. In my support ticket I made it clear that there is an additional person/account that accesses Tribes:Ascend from the same IP address. The following day I received a response simply asking ""What would their account name be?"" (referring to the other player's account). After informing them of the other account's name I was told that they would see what they could do. I was later confronted by the other account holder who informed me that they had broken Hi-Rez's terms. Clearly the reasoning for my ban was because a completely separate account holder broke the terms of agreement.

On May 30th, after not hearing back from support, I sent a new email inquiring if there had been any progress on my situation. Support replied by saying ""There is nothing I can do for you. The IP ban applies to that IP and all users associated with that IP."" Being a paying customer, I found this both infuriating and insulting. Guilty by association!? It's hard to believe that an online gaming company won't/can't differentiate between a guilty and innocent party. Being separate accounts, registered at different emails, having made separate purchases they SHOULD be treated as separate entities. How is it ethical that my account be held responsible for an unconnected party's actions? A party who's account I have no control over. Simply checking the log-in dates would show that my account had not even logged in on the ban date. This easily proves that my account is not the guilty party. Checking match history would also prove that the accounts are owned by separate entities. The two accounts have accessed the game at the same time on multiple occasions in both the same match as well as separate matches. These accounts both have considerably high ranks, far too high for one person to obtain individually. In addition to all of this, an email was sent from the abuser to Hi-Rez verifying that he was the guilty party/account.

Looking through HiRez Studios' Terms of Service, I fail to see any mention of associated IP accounts being banned as a punishment. Therefore, I am claiming that my account has been unjustifiably banned. If I cannot access my account to use the unspent ""gold"" I have acquired through my purchases, I would like restitution or an unbanning of my account. I DID NOT accept the terms of service for the abuser's account, and SHOULD NOT be bound to the punishment of breaking them. 

Hi-Rez Studio needs to realize that there is an innocent customer at stake who has spent money and time in game. It is unethical and irresponsible for a business to assume all accounts that have accessed their servers through the same IP are breaking terms because one has. Especially when there are ways to determine who was in-game at the time of the offense.

It is now June 14th, and I have opened several more support tickets on the situation. There has been absolutely no response from Hi-Rez Studios. On numerous occasions I've attempted to contact the business by telephone, however my calls go unanswered.

I miss my MIRV launcher!

I know we've had a few posts in the past mentioning all the bugs in the game with the mega thread on the forums + reddit that first came to mind: http://forum.hirezstudios.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=313&amp;t=103980. I also have a large document of what was mentioned in the past throughout various posts. So with all of that said, we want to try and get some these bugs squashed - specifically the most important ones.

What I'm asking from you guys is to consolidate a list of what you think are the most important bugs that need to be fixed.

The way I want to approach this idea is to start with this thread and get everyone's take on what they feel are the most important bug fixes. From there, I will gather up all the responses and make a big list of what was mentioned. With that list, I'd like to put together some sort of meeting where players will vote on what they think are the top 5/10/20/__ (We'll see how far we can go).

Let me mention that we may not be able to fix the whole list of top 5/10/20/__. We'll have to delegate which ones we can do and which bugs aren't as feasible. Help me help you guys by helping me brainstorm a list of the top bugs to help carry on not only the competitive side of Tribes, but the general good of the game.

Thanks for all the support in the past and the passion you carry forward to this day. We still have much love for our community and the Tribes franchise itself. I think we had a great show today on BTBP and believe us when we say we do want to work towards some kind of way of supporting community tools.

They may be obvious to some, but I know many aren't aware of some of these that I think are worth noting:

- When the generator's almost down it glows red, but it also makes a low pulsing noise you can hear almost anywhere on your own base. It'll tell you the gen's about to die at least a few seconds before it actually does, allowing you to often catch people in the act.


- The sentinel's BXT1 rifle takes nearly double the time to charge in the air as it does when you're standing on the ground. If you're trying to hover over something to get a last desperate shot off, it might be worth it to charge at least partway before leaving the ground. - [addendum from the comments](http://www.reddit.com/r/Tribes/comments/tl72p/subtleties_you_think_others_might_not_know_about/c4nqswx)


- The forcefield'd off holes in the floor of the Arx Novena gen room allow your shots to go right through. I see lots of failed grenade throws thanks to this.


- Puffs of snow/footprints give away cloaked infiltrators in Katabatic's snowy hills.


- Courtesy of a reddit thread a while back: if the explosion of a doombringer's mine sets off another mine, the damage won't stack and instead stays at 700 regardless of how many mines go off. It's better to space them out pretty widely.


- Edit add: Enter GOTTAGOFAST in the Extras-Secret Codes menu and it changes all your speeds to SANICS.

I hope you all were able to watch Behind the Blueplate today as we did talk about some great stuff. If you didn't then shame on you. You still have a chance to get the full VOD at http://www.twitch.tv/behindtheblueplate/b/335919845

Anyways, i'm here to recap you on some of the cool events we have planned as well as starting some conversation on possible ideas and suggestions. This is all an attempt to not only get more people into the community or to teach new people the ways of tribes - but also to help the current community stay interested in the game. So what Jim Christ initiated was a group of solid community members to start some events to make this happen. Here are a couple ideas we discussed earlier:



1) Pub Nights - We plan to have designated times during the weeks of November to play pubs with your favorite streamers as it gets streamed on their channel. This will help by allowing players have a more organized way to play public games without that annoying llama grabber getting in your way. Being on the mumble server is not required but it is recommended. It will also vary in game types as we seem to always play CTF each and every day. We're going to change it up with some Rabbit, Team Deathmatch and Capture and Hold. All of this will be available to everyone at the times that we will announce in the future. No more waiting on captains and waiting for a game to start - it will be going on hopefully all night. Oh yeah, there will be contests and prizes as well ;)


2) Beginner Workshops - This is planned to be a 2 night a week event. It will vary from improving movement and combat skills to learning roles from a beginners stand point to an experts. This will help players to understand the game more and also bring everyone together. Anyone interested in volunteering, please feel free contacting myself or Jim Christ!


3) Pickups - Yes we have pickups going on nearly everyday (see www.playapug.com) but this will be more involved as we will help new players getting coached by top players. We will make it so players will be playing against others in their own skill bracket. They will also be streamed so you can watch yourself play later on if you will! Pickups are a great way to get a different taste of tribes if you haven't done so already. Please give them a shot if you haven't done so already.



We have plenty more events planned in the near future but we are working out the details the next couple of days. So be sure to stay tuned to the next Behind the Blueplate as Jim Christ will be featured to tell you what more we have planned. I'll give you a hint - prizes and epic games are expected ;)

One last thing - and this is very important to us and you. Join the steam community group as you will see we will put all of the events there in an organized fashion so it is easy to follow everything going on: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/natribes. You will see we already have some pub nights planned at the end of the month with your favorite streamers so make sure to keep note! There is also a twitter account that will announce everything if you're into the twitter scene: @natribes.

That is all for now but certainly not the end of it. Please contact me with any questions or suggestions. This is a COMMUNITY effort so any and everyone is welcome to get involved. The more the better! Cheers &lt;3

Deadlines meant **absolutely nothing.** The schedule for games played, as well as who was playing who, was not set until the **NIGHT BEFORE** some teams were supposed to play. Team's rosters were changing way past the deadline was set. Players were allowed to be added to teams roster at ANY TIME, given that player had not played in NASL before.

Even the rules were changing on the fly. HiRez_Bart said loudly and clearly on a stream over a week ago, that multiple snipers were allowed to be used. Some teams used this strategy, and won games. This past weekend the rule was suddenly reversed, mid-game.

The rule is listed here
http://nasl.tv/News/Article/20120510tribes-tournament-details-unveiled

This information can only be reached through the news section on the website. No contact information was given. It is impossible to find any other information about the tournament (teams, rosters, schedule, etc.) from the website nasl.tv.

While I know Tribes is still in it's early stages of development. HiRez has someone DEDICATED as an e-sports spokesperson. This person REALLY needs to step up their game and commit themselves more. If they are putting in 100% and not accomplishing the things they need to accomplish, then more delegating or hiring needs to occur.

First impressions HiRez. Incredibly important. CSN had 2K+ viewers at first. NASL is bringing in a few hundred. While I know there are plenty of other variables to call in, can't help but be scared!

1339947733.0,133,self.Tribes,v6igl,I think first person bullet weapon projectiles are only client-side and do not actually represent where your bullets are going...can anyone confirm? Serious implications for high pingers. (warning: long but thorough),171,38,54,http://www.reddit.com/r/Tribes/comments/v6igl/i_think_first_person_bullet_weapon_projectiles/,"For the past couple of months I've been living in an area with horrible internet connection. I went from having a typical ping of 30-45ms to 200-250ms. I still manage to play decently using projectile weapons like the disk launcher and the mortar, but ever since I've moved here, I've been absolute crap with all automatics. 

I think I've figured out why: unlike the ""elegant"" projectile weapons (fusor, mortar, etc), the bullet projectiles you see when you fire an automatic are not actually representative of where those projectiles are traveling in-game. 

For example, when using elegant projectiles in high-ping situations, there is a delay between the moment your weapon fires and when the projectile actually appears. Your spinfusor will make the firing animation, and then a moment later the disc will shoot out. However, that disc you fired will behave like any normal disc after its been launched and exists in the game world as a true entity. 

This is not true with automatics. Even under pings as high as 500ms, when the delay between clicking the fire button and the actual launch of your disc is so long the game is unplayable, *your automatics will always begin firing as soon as you pull the trigger*. However, those bullets you see are **NOT REAL**. They exist strictly on your screen (client-side), but the server registers them as being somewhere else, suffering from the same lag as your spinfusor discs. 

There is a simple way to demonstrate this even if you have a great ping. Join a game (note: this can not be demonstrated in training mode). Pick any loadout with an elegant projectile weapon and an automatic, like a Jugg with a mortar and the X1 LMG. Now go into third person. Tilt your camera angle a little off-center (by pressing and holding middle mouse). 

Now fire your mortar. Your mortar will launch  in the direction your character is facing, regardless of where you have spun the third person camera angle, as it should. This is to be expected since you are rotating your third person camera, not your actual character.

Now switch to your X1 and fire. You will notice that **your bullet projectiles will come out of your weapon at whatever angle you are facing your third person camera, even if it is 180 degrees opposite to where your character is facing**. For example, if i am in third person view looking at the side of my character and fire my X1, the bullets will appear to come out of the machine gun at a 90 degree angle from the barrel of the weapon. 

These bullets are not ""real"". If you switch back to first person mode, you will see bullet decals on whatever piece of terrain was directly in front of you. 

What are some of the implications of this? 
Well, it explains why I and many others who suffer from high pings are absolutely useless with automatics. It's not because we suck - its because *we literally can not tell where we are shooting*.  It is infuriating and confusing to see a steady stream of bullets appear to land directly on your enemy but register no damage. This is happening because due to lag our projectiles are actually landing somewhere else, but this information is not relayed visually to the user. Unfortunately, no amount of practice in ""training mode"" will help a high ping user because training mode operates under zero-lag conditions. In training mode, the bullets you see on your screen are true representations of where you are firing. This is no help for users who need to learn how to compensate for high ping. 

It has not escaped my attention that this may be the reason why HiRez has designed the hitboxes on bullet projectiles to be so large. A user with a middle-of-the-road ping can still be effective with automatics because although he suffers from the same false visual feedback, the large bullet hitbox makes up for the difference between where he thinks he his shooting and where he is actually shooting.  

How can this be fixed to make automatics fair for high ping users? 
Simple, make first person bullet projectiles suffer from lag, just like discs and mortars, so that the visual feedback on the screen actually represents where the bullets exist in the game world. This way users can adjust their aim based on the path their bullets are traveling. For example, I'm still decent with spinfusors even at 250 ping because my brain has compensated for that slight pause between the time my weapon fires and the disc is actually appears on my screen. The automatics are impossible to compensate for because we can't see where our bullets are going and the visual feedback we are receiving is false. 

I have tested this on almost all the automatics in the game with the same results. Hit scan weapons suffer from the same problem, but since they're hitscan it doesn't really matter - where you shoot is where you shoot. 

I realize that footage demonstrating this fact would be extremely useful, however I have never recorded gameplay footage in my entire life and I don't have the slightest clue how to submit videos to youtube. Could someone who knows how to do these things maybe upload a short clip online demonstrating the phenomenon I am describing? Remember: you have to join a real game, the wonky bending-bullets thing doesn't happen in training mode. 

Also, I avoid the official HiRez forums like the plague and sometimes miss posts on this sub, too. So I apologize if this has already been discussed before. It's a new discovery to me. 

EDIT: I posted this topic on the HiRez forums too. You can find it [here](http://forum.hirezstudios.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=313&amp;t=75206&amp;p=951156#p951156).

I've been doing a wee bit of testing lately on doombringer mines, I really hope pservers make testing this kinda stuff easier in the future.  Things I've noted and may help you be a better doombro for your teammates.

1. As shown in the screenshot edit, doombringer mines do not daisy chain beyond the first mine.  I'm not sure if this is a bug or intentional to prevent cool stuff from happening?  
2. Mines do a maximum of 700 damage even when stacked directly next to each other but have a higher impulse (force which pushes a player away)
3. Mines set off other mines through your forcefield, so don't stack them on each side, you only need one.
4.  Safety Third does not increase the range of your mine explosion or the trip point.  Again, not sure if this is a bug or a feature.
5. Mines always do the same amount of damage at all range, 700.  So it's best to place it as far away from the flag as possible while still being in the trip range.
6. The explosion radius seems to be double the trigger radius, making it physically impossible to cover the flag directly with more than one mine.
7. I don't have the ability to test if the trigger range is a dome shape or a cylinder shape.  If its the former, then placing them directly on the flag might stop hover caps (though you're a pretty lazy HoF if you cant stop these yourself) while if it's a cylinder shape its absolutely useless to put them directly on the flag.

More to follow.

So in practice, a single mine on the flag will set off almost every viable mine position on the flag stand (bar ARX and Drydock and maybe Sunstar) making it absolutely vital that you do not place any mines directly on your flag, or anywhere near each other for that matter.

HiRez said it could not be possible. So it's a miracle, because I got my first test map working (don't judge me for a map without textures and assets, I'm new to Unreal Engine!), here it is: http://youtu.be/Gui4oncgiZg


So this is another step to accomplish Tribes Ascend modding, and I think it's GREAT.


Well, now I'm starting with the GUIDE to MAPPING.


1. You will need the UNREAL DEVELOPMENT KIT (UDK) build 7748 BETA (January 2011), you can take it here: http://download.udk.com/UDKInstall-2011-01-BETA.exe (Thanks Epic Games for saving old builds, and ggs to the HiRez new tecnologies researcher).

2. You will need the TRIBES ASCEND DEV CLIENT, that is in Altimor's Repo on Github (it's a torrent, that the community is seeding for you): https://github.com/AltimorTASDK/TASDK (it's the 'bin' torrent).

3. Also, you'll need the Tribes actor scripts (that's for placing things such DS &amp; BE flags, Inventory Stations, etc, interactive assets, I think). You can find it here:  https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/17736620/TribesGame.rar

4. Put the folder 'TribesGame' that is inside the .rar into (for example) C:\UDK\UDK-2011-01\Development\Src\.

5. Go to (for example) C:\UDK\UDK-2011-01\UDKGame\Config\ and open UDKEngine.ini, search for UnrealEd.EditorEngine an at the end of that section, write ModEditPackages=TribesGame.

6. Close &amp; Save.

7. Launch the UDK Editor, there will appear a message saying that a few scripts are outdated or something, just press YES and wait for a Console to appear, make something and then display a message with the SUCCESS word. Then CLOSE it.

8. Re-Open UDK Editor. Now if you're familiar with the Editor you will know what to do, but if not, just search for videos to learn the basics of this Editor.


-- FOLLOW THESE STEPS WHEN YOU WANT TO TEST YOUR NEW AWESOME MAP --

1. In the UDK Editor, go to the ""Build"" tab &amp; click ""Build All"", wait for it to finish.

2. Once it's finished building save the map into your TRIBES DEV CLIENT previously downloaded (yeah, the torrent client) and SAVE THE MAP INTO ""YourAwesomeTribesDevClientFolder\bin\TribesGame\CookedPC\Maps"".

3. Now execute your Tribes Dev Client ""TribesAscend.exe"" that can be found in bin\Binaries\Win32\TribesAscend.exe AND execute it like that: TribesAscend.exe YourMapName (don't put the .udk format) -seekfreeloading and profit, you will be testing your map with a SLD loadout if you followed these simple steps.


(For anyone who doesn't understand the execute part, just open the windows execute dialog, then write the directory path of your Tribes Ascend Dev Client like that: C:\Users\Midgard\Desktop\tadev\bin\Binaries\Win32\TribesAscend.exe Midgardmap -seekfreeloading AND press ENTER, and it's done, TA will execute &amp; load your map).

And that's all for the moment, I will be messing up with UDK and TA SDK so I can learn more things to do, even importing assets (yeah, I don't know how to import custom assets right now).

But this was the most adrenaline I've ever gotten from any FPS.,127,12,51,http://www.reddit.com/r/Tribes/comments/18lyx8/ive_only_played_8_hours_but_this_was_the_most/,"I picked up Raider a bit ago, and I've been sticking (heh) with him for about an hour of play so far. I just played a really good (for a noob of eight hours), and decided to save up for whatever the fifth in-game callin was (I had no idea). 

Anyway, I was at about 7k gold with about four minutes/30 kills left in the game (us ahead by a lot). I wasn't sure if I would make it, but an assist or something plus an epic (lucky) fourth sticky kill on the flagbearer brought me up. At about thirty seconds left in the game, I stood atop a fairly high hill to try and call it down on two or three player icons I'd seen. Unfortunately I'm a complete noob and didn't know the map, I'd actually been seeing the icons through a wall. They were still on the other side.

I decided to call it down anyway, since I really wanted to see what it did. It felt like it was taking forever to call down, and then all of a sudden I see our flagbearer coming full-speed round the wall/cliff from in between all those enemies, who were in hot pursuit. He was heading straight for me. I basically just stood there holding LMB pointing right at those treacherous motherfuckin' Sworders, but I was really pissed cause I thought I'd die before I got to see what the call-down did. Not quite... Instead, I died right after the circle thing filled up. I was pretty happy cause I was gonna get to see what the call down does.

Turns out it was an orbital strike. It fell as every single enemy in the chase (a total of four) passed over my dead body. Every last one of them died. I spent like ten seconds just screaming at my screen after that. It felt like one of those videos you see of people tossing grenades across the map and getting triple kills. Except for me, it was four motherfuckers speeding at 140+ miles per hour across my dead body chasing down some Usain Bolt carrying our flag. I had looked every one of them in the eye. I had stood feet from them, with the last milliseconds of my call-down ticking, as the last bullets entered my body. And not a single one of them got out alive, as our flagbearer triumphantly skiied away from the ashes of their bodies and the immortalized corpse of my martyr avatar. 

I can't describe how it felt. And all this on my first Orbital and first &gt; double kill. I got some screens, too (unfortunately none of the flagbearer): http://imgur.com/a/eWjOQ

1330608852.0,112,self.Tribes,qcvu8,Tribes Ascend needs to get rid of victory-based Experience.,180,68,114,http://www.reddit.com/r/Tribes/comments/qcvu8/tribes_ascend_needs_to_get_rid_of_victorybased/,"**How it currently works:**

[According to this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Tribes/comments/q3rfm/calculating_xp/) (which seems to be correct, or near correct, at least based on experience) and [these tables](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1281220/2012-02/Tribesascend_XPperMinute_spreadsheet001.png) (which agree with the previous link), your Performance Bonus is a combination of 2 things: Your position on the scoreboard, and if your team wins.

**Why this is bad:**

1. It promotes teamstacking. With the XP given to the winning team far outstripping the losing team's Performance Bonus, it is beneficial to be on the winning team. Thus, if your team is losing or lost the previous round, it is beneficial to teamswitch to the winning team. Likewise, if you join a game in progress, there is an incentive to join the winning team.

2. It makes losses more frustrating. The sting of defeat should be enough. This will be especially true once profiles and stat tracking is introduced.

**What getting rid of it would do:**

1. Promote balanced teams. If there are 2 players that are substantially better than the rest of the match, they would both almost assuredly get First and Second place on a team's scoreboard and win. However, if they split up, they would both be securing 1st place and therefore netting more experience for themselves. Likewise, if you join the game in progress, you would want to go to the team with less credits (usually the losing team), as it would be easier for you to get to a higher position on the team.

2. Get rid of most bad manners which revolves around keeping matches going. With victory being the deciding variable for xp gain, some cappers will hold on to the flag at the 4th cap to drain time on the clock, thus securing a larger base pool to be boosted. Since capping tends to not provide the most credits over a long period of time, holding onto the flag for longer would decrease your credit gain (by lowering your position on the scoreboard), giving incentive to cap the flag quickly and end stacked matches.

**What it wouldn't fix:**

1. Bad behavior for scoreboard ranking. Some needed roles (flag capping, chasing...) typically give less credits than other roles (HoF, offense...), making positions more coveted for farming XP. Likewise, bad behavior (returning the flag immediately all the time, only saving for Orbitals...) is still promoted since it gives you credits.

2. If you are not performing well, your dedication to winning or even playing well is diminished, as it will not give you bonus experience.

3. The fact that Temple Ruins exists in the map rotation.

**What else could fix it:**

1. Any kind of matchmaking in which you do not get to choose your team. Even though matchmaking is planned (or else Ranked is going to be a joke), the XP bonus should still be disabled until this time to promote better team balance.

2. Making the victory XP far less significant, so that scoring high on the losing team is more beneficial than performing poorly on the winning team.

What I find REALLY insulting is that while you have created ONE title of the Tribes IP, r/tribes is the place on reddit for discussion on ALL Tribes titles. ""A subreddit for the **Tribes franchise** and its **players**. ""

This was MY decision to play these games for the times that I did. While I was never subscribed to your forums or updates, I still want to have my fair share of Tribes news and content across ALL titles, and I will not roll over to have it tainted due the lack of your company's efforts. 


Tribes has a long running fanbase, and now the creation of /r/officialtribes by HiRez is just a middle finger in the air. The title of sub is what grinds me, there is nothing 'official' about what you have done, you are just a link in the chain of developers juggling the title. How long till the next developer picks up the IP from you? At least plan ahead and give them the benefit that they don't have to pick up all the pieces spread across multiple social media platforms. It would be a daunting task for the future holders, and I think their first announcement should be to point all of the followers back to a SINGLE interactive point of communication.

On the airplane home from PAX, so just killing some time. Warning: this turned out longer than expected.

PAX was a blast, another exhausting 3-day marathon of too much boozing, too little sleep, and just the right amount of hard work. It was fun hanging out with Bart, APC, remiCs, my Twitch co-workers and various eSports superstars. Plus, when Seattle is sunny it is an awesome &amp; beautiful city.

But that's not what I'm posting here to talk about. Today, I want to give some of my thoughts and feelings, all my own, about the current state of Tribes and it's diverse community.

**Part 1: History**

As you may or may not know, the Tribes community has been shrouded by a thick, dark cloud of negativity since early after the release of Tribes 2. The game was buggy as hell and suffered through weekly patches which often introduced new, worse bugs. T2 base implemented a 'speed cap,' eliminating the adrenaline inspiring speeds that were possible in Tribes 1. 

Many top teams despised the game, but the community was large (the game sold ~500k copies) and, eventually, mods were developed to return Tribes 2 to what had made T1 so great. Tribes 2 went on to have a comparably rich competitive scene to that of Tribes 1, but the game was always marred by its release debacle and true T1 heads never fully accepted the game.

Three and a half years later, Tribes: Vengeance was released to critical acclaim, but suffered a similarly buggy launch as Tribes 2, notably lacking dedicated servers for the first week after launch. However, unlike Tribes 2, Tribes: Vengeance was never planned to be a successful title. T:V was the unwanted bastard child of publisher Vivendi, received piss poor marketing (I mean, just [look](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a1/Tvbox.jpg) at the box art), was launched among various triple A titles (Half-Life 2, World of Warcraft), and literally got no support after launch. The *very first* patch after launch was canceled after about 2-3 months of stringing along the community at large to the outrage of the competitive community.

Like Tribes 2, Tribes: Vengeance found salvation in a very rich user-made modding and mapping scene, and became my second favorite Tribes game after Tribes 1 base, the dearest to my heart. However, Tribes veterans were so wary after the massive failure of the Tribes 2 launch that the community simply did not buy the game. By some reports, an abysmal 47,000 copies were sold 6 months after the launch of the game. Tribes fans were first burned when the T1 expansion was canceled, second burned when T2 failed to meet expectations, and burned again when T:V's lackluster launch was made worse by a complete lack of support from the publishers.

At that point, as a Tribes player from the ages of 11 (1998) to 18 (2005), I had little faith that we would *ever* see another Tribes game. Though there were many mods in development to act as spiritual successors of the Tribes franchise (Legends, Legions, Rise, the list goes on and on), there was no way that any of these mods were going to revitalize the Tribes community, much less make it on their own as standalone titles. Legions came the closest, but InstantAction was 2-3 years before the Free2Play business model was figured out leading to the premature death of an otherwise promising platform.

**Part 2: Tribes Ascend**

Flash forward to  Tribes: Universe and Tribes: Ascend being announced by HiRez Studios. 

My first thoughts were something along the lines of ""Holy shit, someone is dumb enough to try and reboot this ultimately niche game supported by a notoriously bitter and hateful community?"" I soon learned the game was Free2Play as well, a model I at the time despised on nothing more than principle. I could already feel the thousands of grimaces across the world from Tribes fans who felt cheated, burned, and downright angry from the previous Tribes failures. I truly felt like some small unknown developer was coming to rape the undead corpse of my beloved franchise for profit. I was scared.

However, I had been obsessed with eSports for a few years at this point and had just gotten a job in the industry (at Justin.tv), and I simply could not ignore the fact that League of Legends was literally changing the face of eSports in front of our eyes with the F2P model. LoL utilized the Free2Play model to support their game as an eSport not just financially with huge cash tournaments, they also embedded info from and the live broadcasting of these tournaments RIGHT in the game client itself, tapping into their massive player base to make for record breaking viewership numbers and escalating the competition. 

Maybe HiRez could do the same with Tribes Ascend? Maybe Ascend would be good enough that two weapon slots and no health kit wouldn't be a problem? Maybe Tribes in fact does have a future?

**Part 3: Tribes Ascend post-launch**

Tribes: Ascend was released in early beta and I picked it up right away. Of course I would, I played every iteration of Tribes (including Legions) and supported each as best as I could, Ascend was no different. After putting a dozen hours into the game I was having a blast. Hell, it wasn't my beloved Tribes 1 but it was by far the most fun I had had playing a new PC FPS since T:V and ET: Quake Wars. I reached out to Todd Harris through a mutual connection and expressed my interest in helping HiRez develop Ascend into an eSports title, promoting it through Twitch.tv, and sharing my rolledex of eSports organizers and personalities. 

Todd was markedly more responsive than the majority of execs at game development studios I speak to. Bart Koenigsburg then moved from a analysis role at HiRez to the straight up eSports Manager of Tribes Ascend. This, to me, was proof that T:A already had a better chance than pretty much any other team based FPS at the time at moving towards acceptance as an eSports title. 

There was a **long** drout period where there were almost no hard core focused FPS games being developed for PC or console, and literally no developers were thinking about keeping their games balanced and competitive at the highest level of skill. I mean, games like Halo &amp; Battlefield literally have no spectator mode and it was impossible to get any kind of response from EA, DICE, etc (not for lack of trying!). So even though T:A isn't the ""perfect"" Tribes game nor does it have all the features you'd want for an eSports title, **it is still Tribes, it is still fun, and HiRez has proven they support the game for competitions and leagues.** To boot, the F2P model has and still does work well for HiRez, giving them capital to invest into things like eSports.

Obviously a point of heavy contention, but from where I stand it looks like *each and every* patch over the last 4-5 months has addressed concerns of the competitive community and made the game, overall, better. Sniper nerfs, chasing buffs, central servers, a cheap and reliable way to set up servers with unique rulesets, a spectator tool that goes above and beyond (altho still needs more) what 95% of other FPS games offer, tons of new maps. While this could have and was done by modders in the past, this is about as good as it gets in the modern day and age when it comes to developer/community response, and I have a decent vantage point to view this type of stuff. 

**Part 4: Recent Events and Conclusion**

Most recently, we saw the CSN ""Get Primed for PAX"" Tournament which frankly yielded dissapointing results. Many of the games casted had slow, grueling defensive oriented styles without all that much flag play. We saw some crazy upsets, but in the end a very dissapointing result as Mono was forced to forfiet due to poor planning and poor luck. And with community 'leaders' like projectile and Mabel being *extremely* vocal in IRC &amp; reddit, it's easy to feel a sort of unease and even buy into their negativity. And hey, it's not Tribes 1 with better graphics. But god dammit, what we have here IS a Tribes game with an active community, mainstream appeal, and developers who do care. We haven't had this since, well, 2001 with Tribes 2. As a life long die hard Tribes fanatic there's no way I won't do everything I can to support this game and this community.

Since this has gotten so long, I'd like to summarize with a TL;DR on things I'd like you to consider:

* Tribes is a niche game with a rocky past, but Ascend has the best opportunity for success we've had and likely will have in the foreseeable future. 

* While the vocal minority of the competitive community may be outspoken, HiRez still is more receptive to ""us"" than the vast majority of game designer/publishers in the known universe.

* We've had some snafoos, but I am confident that if we continue to support the game, HiRez will continue to support us. I've seen nothing to make me think otherwise.

* I just fucking love Tribes and it makes me sad to see all this negativity. If you like the game, play it. If you don't like the game, find something else to do with your time!!!! (I suggest collecting bugs, perhaps knitting?)

bonus points:

* HiRez is a small *independent* developer of less than 50 employees. This means they do not have stockholders to answer to, they work on projects they want to work on, and are agile with development and business model. They *chose* Tribes, doubtfully as some kind of money making scheme (considering the ""success"" if previous Tribes games lolol).

* Ascend as an ""ESPORT"" - I doubt it can ever become a huge eSports title, but we could continue to see more money in tournaments, better viewership on streams, and more top tier teams if we work WITH HiRez instead of demonizing them.

* The game has a long way to go to be ideal for competition, but BE CIVIL. Developers are real people, and when you are hateful, disrespectful, and tactless you are not going to be able to communicate effectively.

My feelings are that hi-rez are a very disappointing company that has not catered to the tribes series very well.  I understand that there are logistical limitations to a dev team of their size, which is why I cannot understand their development decisions beyond ""we want to make a short-term profit and quickly move on to the next project.""  A dev team of their size should be actively courting community development to increase the quality and longevity of the game.  They do not have the means or resources to create enough interesting or high quality content by themselves.  Coming from a competitive perspective, it's ridiculous: their devs are generally awful at the game and have no clue what they should be doing to make the game competitively viable.  On top of that, we have to communicate everything through a middle-man, so there is the possibility of many ideas being lost in translation.

I hear a lot of excuses about their f2p model, and how customization simply doesn't work with it (like having the ability to create custom servers with all content unlocked), yet it seems to work in tf2 just fine.  Now I'm fully aware that there are different circumstances regarding tf2's model (valve has a large budget, good reputation, the game was originally part of the orange pack which sold retail, etc.), but it seems no less of a stretch to use the tf2 model than copying LoL's model, which is designed for an entirely different genre.  In fact, if anybody is aware of research or papers done on various f2p models, I'd love to read it.  As of right now, it feels like most arguments either for or against these models comes from the success/failures of other games (which have many variables that may or may not apply to the tribes franchise) or arguments coming simply from intuition.  

I'm going to be frank: the competitive scene will die (and die soon) if something drastic isn't done.  The iterative and ultra-slow process that hirez has been using to this point has been relatively ineffective at keeping people interested in the game.  There will probably be some influx of new players from pugs, but I think ultimately as those people gain skill they too will realize the design problems that occur as you get better.

So much of this problem could be fixed if they could figure out how to monetize the game while still allowing the ability to mod and create community content.

(No talk of nerfs/buffs at all!),132,19,72,http://www.reddit.com/r/Tribes/comments/vci8q/my_short_list_of_requestsideas_for_the_game_no/,"Okay so here's a short list of things that I think would improve the game, I would have posted it on the Hi-Rez forums but everything there seems to be taken with such hostility so I figured I would try them out here first.

1) An option to enable toggle zoom for ONLY the BXT and Phase Rifles. It's quite annoying for those of us who like to use toggle zoom for sniping to change it each and every time we switch to/from sentinel

2) The option to choose HOW indicators are displayed. Icon Only / Text Only / or BOTH. Sure, that may be 'BobTheBuilder's Light Turret' to the left of the flagstand , but I don't care who it belongs to. The words just get in the way, especially in the presence of multiple deployables.

3) Add an element in the HUD that displays icons for what perks are currently active. It wouldn't have to be anything large, but I think it would be helpful, especially for new players that are still experimenting with different perk combinations. [Here is a quick mock-up of how I think it should look](http://i.imgur.com/f9Scw.jpg)

4) MORE CONSOLE COMMANDS! Call me old fashioned, but I much prefer being able to quickly enter something in the console to moving through a sluggish GUI. In my opinion, anything that you can edit in the .ini you should be able to edit from the console.

5) Enable a ""quick escape"" from in game menus. Let's say I want to switch one of my Pathfinder classes Primary Weapons from Bolt Launcher to Dueling Spinfusor. I have to open the menu, navigate to pathfinder, select modify, select primary weapon, and choose my weapon. Then if I want to back out, I have to hit escape FIVE TIMES (or hit M and then escape). I don't think I'm alone when I say that hitting escape once, no matter where you are in the menu, should take you directly back to the game.

6) Custom crosshairs. CUSTOM CROSSHAIRS. People are already running the game in windowed/borderless mode and using third party programs to overlay crosshairs, or (like me) they have marked their monitors with a sharpie or something.

7) First person spectating. Come on, why not?

8) While I don't expect this to ever happen, weapon-specific and zoom-level-specific sensitivities would be fantastic.

9) Team/Color coordination. [This picture explains it better than I can with words](http://i.imgur.com/rDaoW.jpg)


That's about all I have for now. I would love to hear feedback. Perhaps I will take it to the Hi-Rez forums soon.

I love some of the new additions to the game, especially for HoF duty such as Forcefields and Fractal Grenades (actually I hate fractal grenades, but I think they're a great concept in area-denial weaponry).

There are a few things I do miss, however.

-**The target painter**. I thought this was the coolest thing since sliced bread; a buddy would paint a target up, lets say the flag pad, which would then display the precise angle you would need to shoot at to hit it with a mortar. That was just gravy. It had other uses too, it told you the precise distance from whatever you were pointing at, could be use to signal other players, distract enemies or just generally have fun with as you were tailgunning.

-**The old Shrike**. The new Shrike is made out of paper mache; it handles almost like a direct port of a Banshee from Halo and I don't like it. I miss the old Shrike; it was a stubborn beast at first, but at least it didn't disintegrate as soon as it touched the ground. The fact that the shields and the thrusters drew from the same energy pool meant that players had to make a choice between speed or survivability, and I miss it dearly. Also, the belly thrusters on the new Shrike are powered by AAA batteries or something; I miss being able to recover a bad dive by hammering the thrusters on neutral and *just* managing to keep it off the ground.  

-**Actually, all the old vehicles**. Havoks, Thunderswords and Jerichos; nothing quite rivalled the thrill of seeing a Havok, loaded to the brim with Juggernauts dancing in their seats, exploding over your flag pad and raining green death upon you. I guess since its no longer a 32v32 game these sorts of things aren't quite as viable. Jerichos were brilliant little deployable assets as well. For those of you who didnt play, it was essentially a Mobile Point Base; you get in the Jericho, take it to position X (usually just outside your base or just outside the opponents base), and get out. The Jericho would then deploy itself, exposing a missile turret on its roof and an inventory station in the back. The current map design doesn't really allow for such a vehicle anymore unfortunately; maps like Arx Novena aren't really constructed for it and I'm sad that it had to go.

-**The Command Circuit**. Oh, now this is a piece of kit I really miss. Again, the maps aren't really so big anymore that this is a necessity, but I often feel blind playing a FPS without some sort of map. The command circuit was one of the most intricate tactical maps ever. It gave an overlay of sensor positions, team assets, team mates, flag position and general terrain. With it, you could take active control over a turret (not actually that useful, the AI was almost always more accurate), issue orders, mark waypoints, see enemies as they came into sensor range and view teammates from a third person perspective. Very nifty and under-appreciated piece of kit.

When I tried to play it for the first time, probably around wed. or Thursday, I noticed immediately that there was a visual glitch with the shadows on the guns and some of the armor.  When I tried to play the next day, the launcher downloaded a small thing for a few seconds, and when I played again, the glitches were gone.  It was a great feeling to know that these developers are so cognizant of what is going that they can make a change like that is 24 hours.  Some devs would probably make us wait until the next patch.  

tl:dr There was an annoying graphics glitch that was fixed within a day, and I am saying thanks to the devs for being so great

Hey everyone. Here is an update on what we are currently testing in regards to automatics for the next patch. We're still tweaking, so nothing is final:

- Increased damage fall-off on all SMGS. (That's a Nerf, damage is falling off faster).
- On all automatics, the final upgrade that reduces reload time by 30% being reduced to 15%.
- On all automatics, a minor decrease in clip size, varied depending on the weapon and slot.
- On a few select automatics, a minor damage reduction (mainly around the Raider's Automatics as compared to Soldier's AR.)

Please discuss.

As an aside: this next patch is going to be pretty huge. It'll have the most balance adjustments since we changed the system to be weapon unlocks in Beta (many focused on better comp play), as well as a couple of other pretty huge features around improving the unlocking experience.

Tribes: Ascend is a very ping dependent game. High ping, lag spikes, and unstable servers all greatly affect a player’s gameplay. The chronic server problems described in the threads listed above have made the game completely unplayable for many players, and have even caused some to quit the game entirely. 

   Hi-Rez first acknowledged this issue around eight months ago in the forum post referenced in [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Tribes/comments/139oli/please_support_the_lag_issue_thread_apc_confirmed/), and then again, about three months later, in this [thread]( http://www.reddit.com/r/Tribes/comments/182hu9/report_network_latencylag_in_game/ ).  

   There has been no further follow up from Hi-Rez on this issue, besides the generic “we’re looking into it” response. The employees at Hi-Rez are obviously well aware of the problem, and yet, they still have not taken the appropriate actions.

   The time for excuses has passed. The Tribes community is long overdue for a constructive response and real solution to these issues.",,False,self,t5_2rdsl,1375721293.0,,t2,True,t3_1joy6s,http://www.reddit.com/r/Tribes/comments/1joy6s/the_tribes_ascend_servers_have_been_fucked_up_for/,

I made a list of accolades that I think could do just that and I wanted to see what you guys thought could be done.

HoF Accolades

* **Fatass** - Bring a fast-moving opponent to a drastically reduced speed.  This could potentially be restricted to a certain radius within the flag stand.

* **Bringing the Fat** - Kill an opponent with the Super Heavy perk.  Takes precedence over Flag Defender accolade and rewards slightly more credits.

* **Flytrap** - Kill a fast moving opponent with a forcefield.


Light/Heavy Offense Accolades

* **Deployable Down** - Destroy a forcefield, turret, or other deployable.  Only given after a certain number of deployables have been destroyed (either 3, 5, 10, or etc -- TBD).

* **Stand Clear** - Destroy any number of forcefields or turrets when your team grabs the flag.

* **Distraction**- As your team grabs the flag, do one of the following:  Displace the HoF; be present while no defenders within a certain radius of the flag stand do any damage to the flag grabber.  The latter would be triggered when your flag carrier leaves the defined radius.


Light Defense Accolades

* **Base Defender** - Defeat LO within a certain radius of the flagstand.  This only applies up until a smaller radius of the flag, upon which the Flag Defender accolade takes precedence.

* **Focus** - Stop an enemy grabber while offense is trying to distract you (correlated with Distraction Accolade).

* **Anti-Siege Unit** - Kill an enemy juggernaut who has mortared your base in the past 30 seconds.

* **Escort** - Kill an enemy within a certain range of your flag carrier.


Chasing Accolades

* **Flag Drop** - Force the enemy flag carrier to drop your flag using either a nitron or sonic punch.  The throwing distance may scale the credits rewarded.  Throwing distance is tracked as a statistic.

* **IDGAF** - Rewarded when you knock the flag out of the enemy carrier's hands by midairing him with a nitron.  Does not require a kill.  Takes precedence over Flag Drop.  Semi-jokingly proposed.

* **Flag Watch** - Rewarded every five seconds the flag is down and the following conditions are met:  You are within a certain radius of your dropped flag; there are no enemies within a certain VISIBLE radius of the flag; your flag carrier is not within a certain radius of your flag stand.

* **Timely Return** - Rewarded when you return the flag when your flag carrier is within a certain radius of your flagstand.

* **Last Second Save** - Same range and conditions with E-Grab accolade, this is rewarded when you kill the enemy carrier or force a flag drop with a nitron/sonic punch.

* **Flag Return (Revised)** - Rewarded only within the last five seconds of reset timer, when an enemy is within a certain range of the down flag, or when the flag is returned when it is proportionally closer to the enemy flag stand (2/3 of the way to the enemy stand maybe?).

EDITs:  Adjusted Flag Return (Revised) -- added distance

Deployable Down -- added more specificity",,False,self,t5_2rdsl,True,,DSTA,True,t3_rriv6,http://www.reddit.com/r/Tribes/comments/rriv6/adjusting_the_accolade_system_to_facilitate/,
1373357658.0,103,self.Tribes,1hx9l5,Please give us an honest answer - yet another open letter to HiRez,115,12,153,http://www.reddit.com/r/Tribes/comments/1hx9l5/please_give_us_an_honest_answer_yet_another_open/,"Righteo, I'll try to keep this relatively succinct rather than rambling on forever.

Basically, the last patch for Tribes: Ascend was on the 12th of March, almost four months ago. Since then, all we've heard about further development on Tribes is a handful of screenshots about Kate's CTF and Arena maps.

Anyone in the community could tell you that based on what we've seen, HiRez has effectively stopped most development on the game. And yet we still have no official reason for this, or even confirmation that this is the case. We have APC and occasionally Kate responding to threads on this subreddit, but they (or anyone else from HiRez) have yet to give us a straight answer about the status of the game.

Now I understand that neither APC nor Kate set HiRez company policy, but the fact remains that APC was specifically hired to provide a communication link between HiRez and the community.

So here's a really simple question for, well, any HiRez employee to answer: **What is the status of development on Tribes: Ascend?**

I know it's super easy for members of the community to pipe up and say that the game's no longer being updated based on what we know, but really I for one want to hear it from the horse's mouth.

That's really not a hard question to answer. What would be most disappointing for me would be to have this thread posted, the usual members of the community talk and discuss stuff in it, and then to have complete silence from HiRez itself. I know for a fact that HiRez has employees who read this sub, so there really is no excuse for not providing a clear-cut, unambiguous answer to a simple question.

HiRez does not owe the community more content - I'm not going to be too distraught if APC or whoever else answers and says that effectively Kate's maps are the last planned content, or that new content is going to be sparse.

What HiRez *does* owe the community is the truth: we, as paying customers, have a right to know if the game is still being developed, and if so what are the reasons why content *has* been so sparse over the last while.

---------

Based on the outcome of this, there are of course follow up questions like whether, if game development has ceased, mapping tools will ever be released. But first things first, I'd like to get an answer on that basic question.

Thank you for your time, I don't really begrudge the job HiRez has done on this game, I merely want to know its current status.",,False,self,t5_2rdsl,False,,DS,True,t3_1hx9l5,http://www.reddit.com/r/Tribes/comments/1hx9l5/please_give_us_an_honest_answer_yet_another_open/,

Yes, I know HiRez doesn't offer the kind of support this game deserves, but you're not helping. Keep that kind of stuff on reddit, for the sake of all that is holy. Bash me for this, I don't care.

1341518117.0,104,self.Tribes,w3bcg,Why E-Sports is like Paintball,141,37,140,http://www.reddit.com/r/Tribes/comments/w3bcg/why_esports_is_like_paintball/,"This post might get a little long.  I apologize for that in advance.  This is a bit of a response to the general feeling of frustration floating around the competitive scene in Tribes: Ascend.  I was thinking and trying to figure out why I was so uninterested in the supposed plight of the competitive players.  I realized that it's because I've been through all this once before.

I play paintball.  Paintball went through exactly what Tribes (and all of esports, really) is going through right now.  Here's a breakdown of the general process.

Phase 1) There's this game that's a lot of fun to play.  You can customize the hell out of your equipment.  There's a very high skill ceiling.  People really enjoy playing it, even if they're not that good at it.  It becomes popular.

Phase 2)  Hey, this is a lot like a sport!  We should try to market it as a sport and a competitive game.  We'll develop rules and tournaments and try to standardize things.  It's not really perfect right now, but we'll figure it out!  People are going to want to watch this on ESPN.

Phase 3)  People who already like the game are interested, but we're having a hard time breaking into a wider audience.  Let's try growing the popularity of the game to hobbyists so that they will become more interested and want to watch the competitive side.

Phase 4)  Ok that kind of worked, but we had to make some changes to the format of our fields because now the new players are wanting to play in conditions more suitable for amateurs.  So now we have this one area for amateurs and one area for competitors.  The amateurs are much larger in number, spend more money in total on the game, so they gradually get more and more of the fields dedicated to them.  Tournaments are now focused more as competitive events.

Phase 5)  The pros are pissed.  There's nowhere to go with this sport.  YOu can play in a few tournaments, maybe win enough gas money to pay for the trip, and maybe get some free gear from your sponsors.  And there's still no audience for this outside of people who already play.  The sponsors are happy to keep you on and pay you small amounts of money to advertise to the casual playerbase for them.

Phase 6)  A general tone of ""this game is dying"" spreads through the hobby.  People enjoy the game enough to keep it alive, but there's this constant undercurrent of disappointment over ""what could have been"".

Sounds familiar, right? I'm not entirely unsympathetic to the competitive scene.  You guys were told one thing and given another.  This seems to be true of most esports, though.  Even the ones getting better support from their respective developers.  Video games as a sport is something that people have been trying to make happen for at least 20 years now, but it hasn't ever really happened, except maybe in the case of Starcraft in Korea. 

I don't mean to be all doom and gloom about it.  Somebody might crack the formula some day.  Right now, though, we focus entirely on making games fun to play.  I'm not sure that any developer has sat down from day one and made it their primary focus to make a game be fun to WATCH.  Until that happens, I think esports is goign to continue sharing paintball's fate of constant competitive limbo.",,False,self,t5_2rdsl,False,,DSTA,True,t3_w3bcg,http://www.reddit.com/r/Tribes/comments/w3bcg/why_esports_is_like_paintball/,

I watched a guy try to escort his flag carrier in TDM yesterday for like 8 maps in a row.  He was slow and would lose his flag carrier up hills, but even if that happened you were damn sure he was walking as fast as possible to get back into position.  When the flag was dropped he would try to get it but get his butt kicked by incoming silvers/golds time and time again, but he never stopped.  This brave man took those beatings and goddamit he stayed by his flag carrier.  Finally, an intense game brings it down to 1-2 against his team and sure enough his flag carrier goes down.  Around a corner slides in our hero for an ultra low speed flag grab completely surrounded by both teams in one of those mega cluster fucks that make TDM so much fun.  He grabs it and starts walking up that  hill determined as ever.  Somewhere someone gets the kill, and just like that, our brave newbie makes his first clutch play.

It took a lot of courage, I know, but in the end, the Rewards could be well worth it. With all these changes to your business model, the transparency, dedicated stream, Public Test Servers, obtaining the communities feedback and using it appropriately. I think this is an all-together fantastic move, by you (HiRez). However, to get the results you are after, **A story needs to be told**. Not exactly a re-launch, as that cost a lot of $ (resources). But I would look into getting the word out to all the top Websites (IGN, Gamespot, etc...) as well as the top Magazines (PC Gamer, EGM, gameinformer, etc...), about all you have been working on there at HiRez Studios (progress, transparency, stream, etc...) and let the WORLD know, that **TRIBES:ASCEND** is better than ever, with a lot more to come! Then, you will see the results you have been looking to achieve. 

Everything is calculated, the next move is your own, put their heads to bed...

To you HiRez for making MY FAV. Game...

For those new to this debate:


The Problem: Right now good cappers are unchasable because they can go 300 on a back to front. With regen they can front load a ton of speed by trading health for speed, which chasers cannot do. The only counter is snipers stopping capper's regen, killing them, or seriously wounding them before they hit the stand. This leads to stale action for players and viewers. Buffing chasing would allow hirez to nerf some aspects of the sniper as more focus could be on stopping the capper at the stand or chasing him down, which is far more exciting for players and spectators. The best buff to chasing would be to increase disc jump impulse, but doing so would allow cappers to go even faster so there would be an imbalance. This in turn would require the removal of health regen and addition of health packs so that cappers could not gain speeds so much higher than what a chaser could quickly attain. Hirez has stated that they do not want to make such a large change and do not want to remove regen, so the solution so far has been bandaid fixes that no one really likes.


Why TTAM's Idea is so good:


He has found a way to compromise between what hirez and comp players want, keeping regen in the game while allowing disc jumps to be buffed, which in turn buffs chasing and actually lets almost any player on the field chase to an extent, even if they respawn after a grab. This change also removes the frustrating and lame mechanic of snipers rapid firing to stop regen and allows for sniper nerfs without making cappers unstoppable. Moving the action to the stand and post grab chases are far more exciting than watching a capper setup for 40 seconds only to have his route screwed by a single shot from a sniper who can respawn into a great firing location seconds after being cleared by the offense. 


The only potential issue with his suggestion I see is causing additional balance problems with say raiders having both health kits and regen, but I am sure there is a way around this, such as only giving the health pack/slower regen to PTHs or some other solution the community/hirez can come up with. These shifts are far outweighed by the awesomeness of allowing strong disc jumps which make the game more exciting for players and viewers. Unfortunately TTAM's idea came late in the discussion and was largely eclipsed by dozens of other competing bandaid fixes in the middle of a 3.5 hour insane discussion. This is probably the most dramatic solution hirez is capable of and possibly willing to make. Even if you do not fully agree and can find some faults, please do everything you can on forums etc to encourage a solution along these lines and let this game be as awesome as it has the potential to be. 

EDIT: here is the text of the forum post
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some things I came up with the Tribal Council (I was the 'off the wall idea' guy):

•Test servers: Need private test servers so high-level competitive players can balance things quickly and comprehensively.

•Add quick draw across the board and make reloading faster (not my idea, but see below...)

•Health Kit/Health Regen Middleground: Make health regen slower (not more delayed, but less hp/s) at high-speed and add health kits as well: 

   •Hi-Rez save face by keeping regen and noobs probably won't notice.

   •Snipers do not destroy routes by stopping regen.

   •Snipers can be balanced by fall-off range and damage.

   •Compensates for the added lethality of across-the-board quick draw and faster reload  times.

   •Decreases the health-to-speed disparity between cappers and chasers because cappers cannot regen health (as much.)

   •Can make disc jump impulse higher at low speed without making cappers superluminal.

   •Adds depth to the game with health kit options (throwing, use time, etc.)

I'm open to suggestions/criticisms, but I really think HR should consider the health kit/regen system.

Congratulations, you're my new favorite game development studio bar none.  Take all my monies.  

Great work, and I'm glad to see you and more companies like you investing in furthering STEM education in your communities.  You're a model for what a company should be.

(Also, if you'd be willing to sponsor a team from North Carolina.... ;)

For those who are curious, I'm uploading video from the competition.  1771 did amazing.

What do you think caused/contributed to T:A fading into near-irrelevancy in the eyes of most PC gamers? 

Before the full game was released there was a huge buzz, everyone from TotalBiscuit to the KBMOD guys were raving about it - so you can't argue that it didn't get enough exposure. Post-launch, it looked great, in terms of player-count. Yet, just a few months after release, the numbers were dwindling, support and updates from the devs were getting spaced further and further apart, and  in terms of growth, the game is all but dead now, other than a few players determined to play stonehenge 24/7. It must be the T:A equivalent of Operation Metro.

Anyway, I digress. I'd like to hear from the community - what you guys think was to blame for the decline of T:A.

HiRez is sitting on -gold- with this thing. As long as they stay the course, and continue to listen to their community, this game will take the gaming industry to task, and -I- think, will recapture some sanity, balance, and skill based gameplay the industry has been missing for so long.

1374254467.0,94,self.Tribes,1in5jn,Cheating on low level pub servers is really getting out of hand. Help us APC!,108,14,79,http://www.reddit.com/r/Tribes/comments/1in5jn/cheating_on_low_level_pub_servers_is_really/,"Now that school is out and all the children are playing, cheating seams to have increased substantially. The pub servers that allow under level 8 are the ones that are badly hit. It's almost always a sentry with an aimbot, but I've also seen an increase in infinite-jetpacking and ""warping"" other people to the edge of the map (I assume it's using an impulse push-back bug).

Because of the way votekick seems to need a huge majority as well as few players abstaining, the cheater almost never gets kicked by his teammates on the first map he plays, so it generally continues for at least 20-40 minutes before he gets booted, once some people switch teams and then realize how bad it is.

My guess is that the /votekick system works as follows:

- Percentage of server is required for successful votekick (&gt;65%?)
- The vote of the person being voted on counts
- Abstaining is counted as a ""no""
- Spectators are also counted when calculating the total votes required, but the vote doesn't show on their screen unless they switch out of spectator mode.

Because of this, votekicks are difficult to pass, but it is certainly possible eventually if the abuse is blatant. A bigger problem is that the kicked person doesn't seem to get their IP banned by the votekick.

I see cheaters every single day on the ""Air Combat"" servers (central NA region), and I assume it's the same ones coming back based on the sheer number of times I've seen it.

Obviously HiRez's automated cheat-detection isn't working in these cases. Please give us stronger tools to deal with these people ourselves.

What I'd like to see is, in order from most important to least:

1. Banning based on IP, not just accounts (I realize this isn't perfect due to dynamic IPs, etc., but I think it's far better than allowing people to use new smurf accounts every day to harass others).

2. Stop counting the target, the spectators, and vote abstainers in the vote calculation if these are being used currently in the kick determination. If they aren't being used, then lower the vote % requirements for a successful kick.

3. Allow for a short description in the /votekick command:
""/votekick FoodForTheEagle For aimbot, infinite-energy, infinite-impulse-knockback.""

I understand that there's also a /report function, but we get no feedback when we use it, and it's obviously not going to help the game in progress. My biggest concern is that the servers most affected are the ones that newbloods are playing on (under level 8), and new player retention rates are going to suffer because of it. This is especially true when many new players aren't going to know how to initiate a votekick.

It also would be nice if APC or other HiRez rep would explain exactly how the /votekick and banning system works currently. (Does a series of successful votekicks ever perma-ban the account, for example?) I don't think obfuscation is helping to keep cheaters from evading the ban-stick so much as it's frustrating players. If this has been explained before, someone please link in the comments.

This matter should be near the top of the ""things to fix"" alongside the top bugs from the other thread.

1343604962.0,89,self.Tribes,xd306,The reason they can't seem to get the balance right,126,37,128,http://www.reddit.com/r/Tribes/comments/xd306/the_reason_they_cant_seem_to_get_the_balance_right/,"...is because they're trying to balance the game for both pub and comp play at the same time.  This cannot be done.  Balance at high levels is completely changed compared to balance at low levels.  

For example:
Chasing is overpowered at low levels, but underpowered at high levels.  A single mediocre chaser can completely shut down a team's offense in a pub (I've done it, and I'm not a very good chaser), because the grabs are so slow.  At high levels, however, chasers have a hugely tougher time catching up to cappers.  That is to say, as the average grab speed increases, chasing gets more difficult far more quickly than capping does.  So balance is quite different at a higher level.

This is true about a lot of other things.  Raider O, for instance, is kind of underpowered at low levels now, because low-level players aren't nearly as good at chaining as higher-level players.  HoFing, like chasing, is easier at low levels, because it gets exponentially more difficult to stop cappers as they come in at higher speeds.  Etcetera.  

The only solution to this is to bring pub play and comp play closer together.  Obviously, the best way to do this would be to raise the level of pub play.  Not only would this make pub games more fun, but it would bridge some of the gap between pub and comp play, making the switch from pub to comp easier and finally strengthening the community.

In order to do that, however, the in-game training needs a lot of work.  The skiing tutorial, in particular, is rather abysmal.  I also think they should add a basic tactics tutorial that would cover things like not llama grabbing, not returning the flag when it's in a secure position, coordinating clears with grabs, etc.  They also might want to add a basic ""roles"" tutorial or something like that.  

One other thing that might help would be dividing pub play into two levels, a ""playing seriously"" level and a ""just messing around"" level.  Not sure if this is a good idea or not, but it bears thinking about.

If they could lessen the gap between pub and comp play like that, it would become much easier to make balance changes that would work for both pub and comp play at the same time.  The comp community has been screaming about problems with the balance, but Hi-Rez can't afford to ignore pub play because that's where a lot of their revenue comes from.  If it were possible for them to balance the game for pub and comp at the same time, they might be a lot more willing to introduce a lot of the changes people have been asking for.",,False,self,t5_2rdsl,False,,,True,t3_xd306,http://www.reddit.com/r/Tribes/comments/xd306/the_reason_they_cant_seem_to_get_the_balance_right/,

- Replaces the DMB Forcefield
- Provides a 45-60 degree ramp for allies(and enemies) to use
- Provides a 50-100 KPH boost to anyone who uses boost in the correct direction (not including enemies)
- Ramp has a sizable wall on the opposite side, not quite as tall as the forcefield.  It does no damage to run into the wall, but does deflect/stop you.
- Ramp does not boost you if the generator is down, but still acts as a ramp/wall.
- Cannot be placed inside walls like the forcefield, and has a light/medium sized spacing on each side to prevent total wall offs indoors.
- Cannot be placed close to the flag like the regular forcefield.  
- Boost Ramp has double the HP of the Forcefield. 
- Maximum of 1 deployed, period.  Upgrades would increase the boost and HP.

Implications

Currently the biggest issue people have with Tribes meta is that chasing is worthless against a pathfinder travelling over 300.  Besides slowing down pathfinders, people are suggesting some of the craziest things to make it easier for chasers to get up to speed.  I believe something like this would help, as well as add a bit more flavor to static defenses.  I also believe this will allow chasers to finally run rage like they are trying to let them do.

Another point is that enemy flag cappers can use your ramp to benefit if they know how to run routes that would utilize the ramp sitting on your stand, but also denies them access to other routes.  It could even be possible to slow them down if they descend the ramp the opposite direction.

Other possibilities is to let us open routes to the flag that normally wouldn't be possible, giving another aspect to the game it didn't have prior.  Say a DMB goes to midfield and places a ramp that allows your pathfinder a huge boost in speed that would normally injure them making them weak crossing the flag.  

Yet another is allowing the fatter of us get to midfield faster to deal with Juggernauts and other long ranged spam.  This allows us to have heavy defense other than the HoF.",,False,self,t5_2rdsl,1338669682.0,,BE,True,t3_uhl7e,http://www.reddit.com/r/Tribes/comments/uhl7e/new_deployable_suggestion_boost_ramp/,

&gt;
&gt;I agree that custom mapmaking would increase T:A longevity and strengthen community.  I'm skeptical that it would bring in a lot of new players; but for players who enjoy TA it means new content, fresh ideas, plus the fun of creating/sharing maps for those into that.
&gt;
&gt;And there is no real issue with F2P model since we decided not to charge for maps anyway.
&gt;
&gt;One of the reasons we chose UE3 was the strength of the editor &amp; mod scene.  In fact many of our Tribes dev team members have modding/mapping background.
&gt;
&gt;Supporting community/custom maps would involve:
&gt; - distributing version of UE editor that also includes T:A specific functionality (for example after you make your map you'd want to be able to test skiing/physics)
&gt; - distributing version of UE editor that doesn't overly expose us to hackers/cheats
&gt; - deployment system for creators to upload maps and then players to download as needed; plus some review process for hi-rez to prevent/minimize dildo maps.
&gt;
&gt;To do #3 (the deployment part) right, without confusing users, is actually a significant  dev effort.   It is something we have scoped out &amp; discussed options around, but not yet scheduled. 
&gt;
&gt;So, the answer is not 'never'.  But it isn't 'coming soon' either.
&gt;

You managed to ski faster than 100 km/h and have proudly and valiantly defended the generator? You had a few wet-palmed duels in the midfield? Great! Now is a great time to:

**STOP BEING USELESS!**

How is this done you ask yourself. One would maybe check out some routes to learn, or maybe try your hand at some chasing. While this is all very good you must remember you are still green as grass and there is much better and easier ways to be an asset to your team. Ways that require a minimal amount of skill but will help you improve and understand the flow of the game just as good as trying a more ""professional"" role.

**What are the goal of a Tribes:Ascend match?**

Winning a match is accomplished by *playing the objective*. What does this mean? While there are many ways you can spend your time during the match there is only one thing that leads to victory, and that is *capping the flag*. Everything you do should in some way help your team to accomplish this. Defense of your flag, and the capture of the enemy's are of paramount importance, nothing comes before that. If you have a teammate bearing the enemy flag, do whatever you can to help her. If the enemy is trying to grab your flag, do what you can to stop him. Ask yourself from time to time, does this help in acquiring or defending the flag? If not, you are doing something wrong.

**What can You do to bring your team to victory?**

**1. Clearing the enemy flag stand.**

*What and why?* To prevent the other team from grabbing the flag a (good) team sets up all kinds of defenses around the flag and base. Without assistance your cappers won't have a chance to get thru the forcefield, mines, turrets and still get away with the flag alive. They must be destroyed.

*How its done:* This is a really simple one. Ski to a vantage point where you have a clear line of sight towards the enemy flagstand and base. Begin shooting wildly at the enemy flag stand. Take out all deployable's and turrets. Keep shooting at the flag stand to make sure your cappers have a clean route to take. When the enemy comes to kill you, duel them and show them who is boss. If boss-showing fails, rinse and repeat.

*Suitable classes:* Soldier, Brute, Juggernaut, Raider

*Next step:* Being closer to the flag stand makes you able to augment your assault with grenades and easier kill the moving targets, but will most get you killed fairly soon.

**2. Defending the flag from cappers**

*What and why?* A lot of damage can be done to incoming cappers before they reach the flag stand. This is much easier than chasing since they often come in a straight and predictable arc towards you, and if you can prevent the grab altogether it's even better.

*How:* Stand at the flag stand, or close to it. The closer you stand the easier it will be to hit incoming enemies, but you will be more vulnerable to harassment. If no one is standing on the flag at the moment place yourself on it, your body will block cappers to a certain degree. Look at the sky and terrain around you and note incoming enemies. When it's clear they are coming in to cap begin spamming your automatic gun at them. Use your alt key and spot them for your teammates. Take note from where they come from, soon you will be able to identify an incoming capper from very far away. Spot as often as you can to get (when you suspect a capper) to get your teammates attention. When they near the stand spam them with automatic fire. Or if you prefer to use a spinfuzor you can keep the capper in your sight and try to hit him when touches the flag. If he managed to grab keep spamming automatic fire in his direction. SSS (Spot, spam, spot)

*Suitable classes:* Pathfinder, Soldier, Doombringer, Technician, Raider

*Next step:* Go Sentinel and try to snipe those pesky cappers out of existence, but focus on the cappers, and spot them as soon as you see them. Or go technician and set up turrets to help bring down the health bar of the enemy as they rush towards your flag. You can also look into becoming a ""Heavy on flag"", but that's beyond the scope of this guide. Google it.

**3. Defending the flag stand from harassment**

*What and why?* As stated in the first post in this list harassing the enemy flag stand is a necessity to clear it for incoming cappers. Naturally we want to prevent this. Our job will be to make sure those people have other things on their mind than to shoot explosives at the defenses we so carefully set up to guard our flag.

*How its done:* Stand somewhere around your flag stand. Look around. Are there any enemies skiing towards you? Ski towards them and kill them before they reach your base and unload their barrage at your poor flag defenders. Look at the sky, see any mortar or spinfuzor trail? Follow them, and you will most likely find a enemy Juggernaut or Brute shelling the flag stand. Ski towards them, and kill them. Easy, right? Avoid being stuck up in duels in places that are not important. Concentrate on the ones that actually pose a clear and present danger to your flag defenses. Don't feel bad if you get killed, the time it took to duel you was a lot of time wasted from doing damage to the defenders.

Suitable classes: Pathfinder, Soldier, Raider, Brute

Next step: Try to coordinate point two and three, both keeping an eye out for cappers and harassment from the midfield.

**(I) I got credits, now what?**

In a match you receive credits for kills, repairs, airshots and a plethora of other things. These are separate from your experience you receive after the match and does not carry over in any way. Hence they should be spent on winning the match, something that does give you more experience. There are a few good ways to spend your dough in a match. 

* Give your HoF (Heavy on flag) an inventory station calldown. Having easy access to mines and force fields will make him very happy. They are also quite easy to destroy so he might be low on cash after calling in a few for himself already.

* Get some wheels. If you play a heavy class and are working on harassing the enemy base a gravcycle to get there can be a worthwhile investment. Especially on larger maps like Raindance.

* Strikes should primarily be saved for the enemy flagstand.

* If you have Technicians working the turrets and generators, upgrading a turret or radar station is not wasteful in any way.

**(II) On life and death**

On the whole, getting kills and dying in Tribes:Ascend are *not very important*. A common mistake for the new player is to place way too much value in the death of an enemy. Why is killing the enemy not very important you ask? Because respawn timers are very short and good players can usually cross large distances in very short time. Killing an enemy on a hill close to her spawn does almost nothing. She can be back within (literal) seconds with full health and ammo. It's mostly a waste of your time, since you probably had to travel a larger distance to get there, you were removed from *playing the objective* a lot longer than she were.

Killing players should be done when they either threaten your defenses or your cappers or is preventing you from *playing the objective*. Ask yourself, is he a direct threat to my flag or the people who are trying to cap the enemy's flag, or to what I am trying to do right now. Will he become a threat in the immediate future? Is there something else I can do than killing him that will be more worthwhile? The answer is surprisingly often: Yes.

Also, don't be afraid to sacrifice yourself. Dying 5 times in a row is nothing if it means you retrieve your teams flag. Abuse the suicide button. Don't view it as a suicide, it's a town portal that in seconds brings you home with full health and ammo. That's not a bad deal.

**(III) A comprehensive guide to shit that be flag related**

When the enemy drop the flag it sits on the ground for 30 seconds before automatically being returned back to your flag stand. The most basic instinct is to return it as soon as possible, however, this isn't always the best course of action. Why is that you ask yourself. Take a look at the flag stand at most levels, it's often a fairly open place, with multiple routes in and out. The flag might have bounced to a position where it's in much better cover, or close to a wall making high speed grabs neigh impossible. Most cappers have also trained routes that culminate in grabbing the flag at it's stand, not 100 meters away tucked in behind two rocks. There is also another benefit in that the enemy have to set up capping routes towards the flags new position, while you are being able to return the flag to it's stand at the first sight of danger.

We will now take a look at situations where it's very beneficial to let the flag stay out in the field for a while or not. 

When to return the flag:

* There is enemies in the general vicinity of the flag.

* Your team has the enemy flag at or close to your base ready to cap it.

* The flag is in an exposed place, or your flag stand is heavily defended.

* You are alone close to the enemy base.

* You don't have good vision of the surrounding area.

When to NOT return the flag

* The flag is in a harder to reach place than your flag stand

* Your team is not in control of your flag stand

* Your flag stand lack defenders.

* You spot incoming cappers towards your flag stand.

* You can bounce the flag to a safe place with your weapon.

I also thought that at NASL, seeing who is friends with who was basically just unprofessional considering the circumstances. 

Is it possible that casters could use an alternate account to cast from where they don't have any friends, especially on well publicized events where people who don't necessarily play tribes might be watching.

He does this as a troll, on purpose, and just laughs his ass of and says ""FUCK YOU!"" when people ask him to please quit ruining the game.

I realize there is a votekick option, but (like with MOST games I have played) this is extremely difficult.

I was just in a match where people started like a dozen votekicks against the guy, and never had enough votes to do it. 

Then you sit their pleading with people to please fucking vote yes, but honestly, by that time the match is already ruined, and Mr. Troll instantly joins another match to start the whole process again.

-Flag capping - I can capture maybe one time out of every twenty.  Most of the time I either get blown up at the moment of the grab because I didn't see that guy with a jackal standing nearby with his perfect timing, or I get chased down by someone with outstanding chase skills.  And then there's the occasional time when I make it back to base just in time to see someone run off with OUR flag, and then I spend the next four or five minutes getting chased around while the rest of the team...I dunno, sits around eating ice cream?  They're certainly not taking any of the pressure off me.  So I eventually die, and the enemy flag carrier walks over and caps.

-Base defense/repair - playing as Technician, every once in a while I seem to make a meaningful contribution, but most of the time I get blown up repeatedly by the Brute/Infiltrator that just destroyed the generator and is now picking out the right color drapes to go with the furniture because they pretty much just moved in and nobody on my team really seems to have much to say about it.  I mean, I *would* politely ask them to leave so I can repair the gen, but they'd just LOL and shoot me in the face, and when I shoot back I'd just miss, because...

-Fighting/Dueling - I'm terrible.  I have poor aim, and no general sense of what's going on.  Hey, there's a guy!  I'll shoot him!  Wait, he moved?  Agh, I just took damage!  What's going on?  Oh, I'm dead?  Darn it.  I'll just respawn, and ski back over to the enemy base.  Hey, there's another guy, and he doesn't see me.  HAHA, Spinfusor to the back!  Wait, what's he doing?  Okay, I can do this-wait, no I can't, time to respawn again.



So far, my skills at Tribes include getting shot, and having a K/D ratio of 1:50 or so.

Now, anyone can improve with practice, but my general FPS dueling/fighting skills have been pretty lousy even since I started in '96 with Quake.  So generally if I'm able to contribute to a team in an FPS game, it's by using some sort of utility role where I don't have to actually fight someone to succeed.  Like in Team Fortress, where I'm normally an Engineer or Medic.

How can I contribute to a team in Tribes with a general lack of FPS skill?",,False,self,t5_2rdsl,False,,BE,True,t3_sjric,http://www.reddit.com/r/Tribes/comments/sjric/im_terrible_at_tribes_but_i_still_want_to_be/,

I'm sick of companies who are largely incompetent and can't release something like a simple skin without breaking half the game due to a combination of inability to do basic development and lack of proper testing. I'm sick of developers who are too money-hungry to spend the time to develop, grow, and maintain a single game before rushing off to their next.

I'm sick of a game so buggy that server crashes and general glitching are not only common, but expected and compensated for by what's left of the competitive communities. I'm sick of unoptimized code and maps and a generally underdeveloped game compared to many games released in the past decade by companies without the experience of a full game under their belt. I'm tired of repetitive gameplay brought on by a great neglect to release content into the game.

I'm sick of people calling me a faggot for going into a pub and chaining just so I can practice my aim a bit, or being called a no-life team stacker just because I want to play with my friends. I'm sick of people who don't even want to try to get decent at the game trash talking as they hover above you and miss their ground-pounds. I'm sick of d-stacks in every pub game because people are too afraid to leave their base, even if they aren't able to stop a capper with 10 people defending their stand, instantly declaring a win for whichever team has an actual capper.

I'm sick of the negative attitude of the entire competitive community in general and how whiny those players have gotten. I'm sick of the back-and-forth narcissism evident every time a rule change vote comes up and how demanding players are. I'm sick of accusations of cheese by those who run cheese themselves. I'm sick of the mood swings popping up every time we get a patch and the fallout two days later. Most of all I'm sick of the petty arguments between players and teams who rarely know fuck all what they're talking about or even what the argument was when they started. (Seriously grow up.)



I love you guys, and I loved Tribes. I advocated for Hirez whenever people tried to shit on them and praised them when they did well (You know, before we found all the new bugs each time.). However, after taking as much as a week long break and seeing what a well-constructed game with good developer support was, I highly doubt I could ever go back to tribes without being peeved by the state of things. At this point, excluding the friendships I've made, I've invested way more time into this game than it's worth.

Thank you for all the fun we've had together and thank you for accepting me into the community all things considering; I really appreciate it. I'll still be in IRC and Steam every day and Mumble not so much, so feel free to say hi.

Tonight while Arx Novena was loading up as the next map and I was thinking of going HoF, since its such a damn fun map for that, I thought about how funny it would be to put up one of my force shields in the enemy's hallway and watch a capper splat into it thinking it belonged to his own team.  So I spent the entire match going Heavy on Enemy Flag, and it was hilarious.

Each spawn, I would get to the enemy base as quickly as possible, plant my force shield in the hallway along the flag stand, and throw out 3 mines.  I basically used the EXACT SAME tactic I would use if I were heavy on my own damn flag.  Here are some of the wonderful things I saw happen:

1.  Just as I'd hoped, a flag capper came flying into the hallway hoping for an easy cap.  He was already hurt, so when he hit my force shield head-on the died on impact, the flag flew through and just happened to land on me for an instant return.  lulz ensued.

2.  Half the duels I got into wound up with my target bouncing into one of my mines.  Never have I gotten so many mine kills.

3.  I lost count of the mine kills I got on cappers right as they were about to score.  The return was almost always easy.

4.  After about 10 minutes, another DMB joined me to HoEF.  We had a force shield at each hallway entrance and more mines than you can imagine, and I bet you can imagine lots of mines.

5.  I found that I almost ALWAYS had another mine to plant whenever one was destroyed- there was enough carnage that ammo pickups presented themselves quite frequently.

6.  I think I had like 8 Aftermath kills thanks to all the mines.

Now it wasn't completely perfect.  We did lose the match.  Our team wound up with like 6 PTH's because I think everyone was inspired to make runs at the enemy base that we so clearly owned, so no one wound up doing much defense at our base.  Honestly, I should have retreated to HoF like normal, but I was having too much fun with my little experiment.

If you decide to try this, be aware of the following things:

1.  You can very easily ACCIDENTALLY llama grab.  You won't mean to do it.  You'll be very diligently NOT grabbing the enemy's flag while you're bouncing around throwing out mine's like you're a flower girl, but someone's disc or mortal WILL knock you sideways into the flag.  

2.  Make sure your loadout gives you LOTS of mines to throw down.  I can throw out 4 at a time and carry 3, and it was quite helpful.

3.  Make sure your force shield is maxed out.

4.  I was lucky in that the only enemy who was interested in HoFing wasn't very skilled and I was able to take him down enough times to frustrate him into trying something else.  If a really good HoF sets up camp, it would probably be damn hard to take up shop as HoEF.

5.  GRAB EVERY AMMO PICKUP YOU SEE

6.  ???

7.  Profit!!!

That's not to say that this content is bad and shouldn't be created and shared, just that it shouldn't completely populate the subreddit. It is spammy to our dwindling subscriber count, puts the SDK in a bad light, and is just plain unprofessional. After discussing it with the other /r/tribes moderators and with ^^^our ^^^savior Altimor, we have come up with what I think is a good set of rules and an amicable solution:

* **No posting of SDK *console* modifications.** Anything post that is simply a one-line weapon rewrite will be deleted.

* **Posting of *helpful* or *insightful* content regarding the SDK is still allowed** ([Example 3](http://www.reddit.com/r/Tribes/comments/1ia5jb/ta_sdk_the_guide_to_mapping/)).

**Now for our amicable solution**: Friday is modification show-and-tell day (**Mod Friday**)! Every Friday there will be a reddit post in this subreddit (tagged appropriately) where you can share your creations or ideas that may not qualify for quality content as described above. For instance, Example 1 and Example 2 would be great additions to these threads as comment posts, whereas Example 3 could be posted whenever as its own thread.

If you have any questions about whether or not your content follows the above guidelines, use your head and think ""does this seem professional and interesting/insightful, or just funny?"" If you think it might be funny/cool content, wait for Mod Friday to post your findings.

The moderators of /r/tribes are all for exposure of the new SDK and interesting mods that are released, so what better way to show our support than to create a special day when you can all share your cool stuff in one place? :)

I then had dreams that I was asked to ring as hof in a scrim, but tribes was real life and somewhere in their house was a stand i was on top of beside a flag. The flags kept getting out so I draped ham over the flag, which kept the offense from finding it. When one of the O found it he didn't want to grab it then, because it was ham covered. He talked to me and for some reason kept asking ""You are on Tao, right?"". Then someone brought me curly fries and I placed them in front of the ham-covered flag to end any chance of grabs getting out.

Then I woke up. I was asked to post this after groggily hopping on mumble, so hopefully it will get buried.

I think we can all agree on that so first order of business is undoing the Nitron nerf.

Secondly the chasing perks need to be changed. Lightweight is the easiest to fix just give it some extra levels

-Lightweight v2-

* mass reduction
* Pre-patch Safe Fall effect
* Moderate version of Quick Draw

Lightweight would retain the regen penalty so you wouldn't use it for capping.

The other perk that needs fixing is Rage. The problem mostly lies in the fact that you can't buff the rage radius without majorly buffing Phase Rifle SEN however we can fix that AND fix the health problems chasers have in one fell swoop.

Simply get rid of the energy regen effect on Rage. Replace it with a short (3-5 seconds) period of invulnerability/major reduction to **ONLY SELF damage**. This lets the chaser get up to speed without taking him down to 50 health if the flag gets grabbed ,stops the SEN using it to ubercharge his Phase Rifle, doesn't let the Raider have infinite shield in  a tense standoff AND it's pretty much useless for cappers.

Chasers could also now run explosive nitrons which should more than make up for the tiny bit of extra speed cappers will gain from using the un-nerfed nitrons.

1339778197.0,80,self.Tribes,v3mwd,Why I'm afraid that the success Tribes: Ascend had at launch will fade.,129,49,123,http://www.reddit.com/r/Tribes/comments/v3mwd/why_im_afraid_that_the_success_tribes_ascend_had/,"Last I heard, HiRez has a team of 15-20 people devoted to Tribes: Ascend.  15 people is barely enough to properly run a 7v7 match and, while I'll refrain from commenting on the skill of the T:A team at their jobs, most of their jobs are not Quality Assurance.  Quality Assurance (QA) being the people who are trying to find bugs and make sure everything is balanced.  To make sure everything is balanced for competitive play, HiRez would need a minimum of 7, ideally 14, competitive level T:A QA personal doing nothing but testing and proposing balance tweaks for 40 hours a week.  Community testers won't cut it because they don't have enough access to the T:A devs to effectively communicate what needs to change.

Next up, Customer Support personnel. These are the people we yell^1 at when our accounts get (unfairly) banned, we want to report a bug or someone hacked our account.  Based on some google searching along the lines of ""tech support per user"", the answer is a ratio.  In other words for every X customers you gain, you need to hire 1 more person for the support team^2 .  Last I [checked](http://www.hirezstudios.com/hirezwp/?page_id=2023), HiRez was not hiring additional support or QA personnel.  To me, that translates to them saying 1 of 2 things: 1) ""We don't care about supporting our current users"" or 2) ""We think our current level of support is ok and we don't expect the game to continue to grow"".  

I view the lack of QA and Support personnel as a big problem.  The lack of QA will prevent the game from becoming balanced in the near future and it certainly won't stay balanced without their constant input.  If there aren't enough Customer Support personnel, T:A will start hemorrhaging players.  Both balance and customer satisfaction are important to the longevity of a competitive PvP game, like T:A.  Unless I'm mistaken, the freemium business model relies on longevity in their games.  They need happy customers buying new things in order to continue to make money.  Considering I've already seen substantial outcry here about the state of both QA and support, I don't think I'm remiss in saying HiRez is already behind in both of these areas.

For these problems I blame HiRez, but I don't blame the T:A team at HiRez.  The T:A team doesn't control the money and the money is what hires QA and Support personnel.  The people who are desperately needed to keep players happy and playing a game that I want to enjoy.  I want to have fun playing T:A.  The movement mechanics and skill embedded in Tribes is amazing.  If HiRez would provide the T:A team the necessary support for the game, it could flourish, grow and seize the potential so many of us see in it.

If anyone at HiRez reads this, understand that I'm writing this as a player on the tipping point.  Down one slope I'm playing T:A for years to come and throwing more money at you periodically.  Down the other slope, I've uninstalled and forgotten about T:A within the next month.  Right now, my momentum is headed toward the other slope.  The one where I'm playing LoL and waiting for Shootmania to come out in the hopes that there will finally be a fun, skill-based FPS for me to play.  Really, it would take immediate action from someone on the level of Erez Goren (Founder and CEO) or Stewart Chisam (VP and Executive Producer) to keep me skiing.

^1: I did tech support for a while and it really does feel like 90% of the people I talked to were yelling at me.

^2: This also assumes you want to maintain or improve your current quality standards.

However as a developer I know how morale breaking it can get to hear only complaints and negative feedback all the time because the people who are enjoying stuff generally don't go out of their way to send in ""Yeah everything is ok"" comments. We all obviously enjoy playing this game so let's just say what makes us enjoy it.


So, to start:


The new patch introduced a lot of new weapons and it's become pretty popular to bitch about what's OP. However I've noticed that pretty much everyone who has gotten together to talk about it has different opinions on what's OP and what's not. The recent behind the blue plate episode highlights this pretty well. I take this sort of thing as a sign of general balance. If most people can't agree on what's overpowered that means that they are all generally balanced.


Second I **love** the new weapons that reward direct hits, making weapons that reward skill is a *Good Thing* and there should be more of that.


*edit*

Thirdly the new upgrade system. This is pretty much perfect in my opinion. I had some reservation about it before the announced that you could instantly master the item with XP or just play the class till you mastered it that way (all while still gaining XP to spend). So you can master the stuff you main and then just let other stuff upgrade over time. I mostly play Capper and Raider LO so I dumped XP/Gold to get the new stuff and master itr  for those class and I just let other classes that I use to fart around in pubs upgrade on their own. 


*/edit*

So yeah, post what you like about the game/community/etc and then we can go back to our bitching later.",,False,self,t5_2rdsl,1339882980.0,,CoP,True,t3_v5dzt,http://www.reddit.com/r/Tribes/comments/v5dzt/some_positive_feedback/,

High speed grabs, Artillery, and flag defender are just a few examples.  there are none for chasers though.  I know that they get flag flag defender if they kill the capper, but most times that's not the case.  They do get flag return, but that is a crappy 250 points and that is not nearly enough for the amount of effort they go through.  Also, the life of a chaser is a short one at best and it is very rare for one to live long enough to get even a few kills in one life let alone a killing spree.

My recommendation is that there should be an accolade for hitting someone with the flag with nitrons.  This is more common than the chaser actually killing the capper and is more important.

It has been really annoying seeing people who play less than me with a higher rank not because of skill or time spent playing, but because of the role they play.

There was another alternative that I was quite fond of, however.  Creating a separate subreddit specifically for unfair/unjust bans from HiRez.  /r/shithirezdoes or something would be better than creating one specific for Tribes though.  If we look at how they handled [Global Agenda hacks](http://www.mmorpg.com/discussion2.cfm/post/4689590#4689590) and bans, and now Tribes: Ascend, one can only imagine this drama will continue into SMITE and other games.  Maybe if things get really out of hand on this subreddit (whole page filled with ban posts), then I'll start redirecting people to take them there.  Just for now, ban posts are allowed since that's what **you guys decided**.  If you do post, some sort of evidence supporting your claims would be great (gameplay videos, for example).  Post suggestions below.  A decent alternative to those who don't wish to see ban posts is to enable the 'hide downvoted posts' feature in your reddit settings.

Ever since the inventory glitch fiasco, there's been a sharp increase in posts discussing Hi-Rez's anti-cheat and banning methods.  As someone who was a victim of a false ban many months ago, along with Hi-Rez's decision to insta-delete any thread discussing bans, hacks, exploits, etc, I was very lenient on allowing these types of posts on /r/tribes.

However, enough is enough.  It's universally agreed upon that their anit-cheat methods aren't exactly perfect, and innocent people can get falsely banned.  But /r/tribes shouldn't be used as your own personal army against Hi-Rez, something that Reddit is very good at doing.  [Hi-Rez has responded to this situation](http://forum.hirezstudios.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=234&amp;t=74650&amp;p=944676#p944676), and you can make of that as you will.

While bringing it up in a public matter like this has had marginal success(flaxig has been unbanned), planning to report an account en-masse in the hopes of getting it banned is just dumb, especially when it's made public on /r/tribes, a website Hi-Rez *does* read.  When there are 7 posts about this on the front-page, something has to change.  And I'm not counting on Hi-Rez's state of the art anti-cheat to actually kick in.  We've created a scenario where if someone posts they've been unfairly banned, the community rallies behind them without any hard evidence proving or disproving their claim.  Yeah, it sucks, but it really is a 'guilty until proven innocent' situation when it comes to game bans (not exclusive to T:A).  And you can almost *never* provide that kind of evidence.

**Allow 'I've been banned' posts?  Yes/No?**

1335293247.0,73,self.Tribes,sqd0s,Hot Gas: An objective look at why the Plasma Gun is terrible,110,37,102,http://www.reddit.com/r/Tribes/comments/sqd0s/hot_gas_an_objective_look_at_why_the_plasma_gun/,"I think we've all figured out by now that the Plasma Gun is a load of shazbot. But why? How did this weapon become so horribly broken? How can it be repaired? And what does this failure teach us?

Watch me now. I'm going to start analyzing.

* **#1: It’s essentially a better Spinfusor.**

It has a roughly equal travel speed, and a massively inflated hitbox. The only thing it’s missing is higher damage, which it more than makes up for in fire rate. The Plasma Gun is to the Soldier’s Medium Spinfusor as the MSF is to the Impact Nitron. It’s simply better in every way. The only thing it lacks is a Spinfusor’s flag-pushing capability, but the ability to kill people before they can even get within ten feet of the flag rather obviates that weakness. Which leads me to...

* **#2: It inflates the Raider’s role far too much.**

With the Plasma Gun, there’s no reason to play Soldier ever again. The Raider was already a great duelist, but this pushes him over the top and into supergod-tier. Everything the Soldier did, the Raider can now do better. And seeing as the Soldier is the “all-rounder” class, that’s a serious gaffe.

* **#3: It’s no fun to use.**

With its “Baby’s First” hitbox and nigh-automatic rate of fire, the Plasma Gun takes the advantages of weapons like the Assault Rifle and the SMG and melds them with those of the Spinfusor, leaving absolutely no downsides. And this is *boring!* If all it takes to rake in the Air Mails is pointing in the general compass direction of an airborne enemy, where did the challenge go? Where’s the excitement? The most fun I’ve ever had in this game was accurately predicting a projectile’s path to coincide with a tiny dot that was my enemy, and hearing that nice THUNK as it connected. If you take the effort out of that, there’s no point!

* **#4: It’s no fun to have it used on you.**

See above. There’s nothing more frustrating than being bombarded with 500-a-pop balls of lightning, and dying before you can even line up your sights on the offending Raider. If at least one Triber hasn’t ragequit already because of plasma spam, I’d be honestly surprised.

* **#5: #1 and #2 make it Pay To Win.**

And that is a travesty. It’s easy, it hits hard, and there is literally no reason not to use it. It wins games by itself! All you have to do is drop a few bucks, and the Fist of God is in your hands!

So how do we fix it?

* **A) Shift it to either side of the spectrum, *without* buffing it to compensate.**

By this I mean make the Plasma Gun more of an automatic weapon (by lowering its damage and hitbox) or more of a Spinfusor (by lowering its fire rate and projectile speed). By this I do *not* mean lowering its fire rate and buffing its damage, or nerfing its damage and buffing its fire rate. These will only keep the Plasma Gun in its current tier of brokenness and put us back in the same boat.

* **B) Penalize the Raider for using it.**

Make the Raider have to give up something, preferably something significant, in order to use the Plasma Gun. Steal his shield pack and make him have to wear a Plasma Pack instead to fuel the thing. If that’s too harsh, make the Plasma Gun fire using energy, a la the Phase Rifle. Heck, while we’re at it, maybe the Plasma Gun could react negatively to an active shield and heavily damage a Raider trying to use both at once!

* **C) Get rid of it and give the people who bought it their money back.**

Maybe the Plasma Gun can’t or won’t be fixed. In that case, do what the Comp scene has probably already done and axe the thing. It has caused nothing but grief so far, and if left unchecked, its Pay-To-Win, boring, but horribly effective qualities are going to kill Tribes Ascend.

Curious, I ventured further and noticed that most of the size came from a ScreenShots-folder. To my surprise, it was filled with stuff. And the stuff was quite familiar, I had indeed taken the screenshots, but via Steam - or so I thought.

Turns out that TA has F12 bound to ""GBA_BugIt"", and F12 is my Steam screenshot key as well.
It grabs a screenshot (in the ah-so-wonderful BMP format, ending up at 5MB per pic or something) and generates a small text file with content such as

*In any case*, if you don't want bug reports generated whenever you take a screenshot with Steam, go to 

\My Games\Tribes Ascend\TribesGame\Config\ and edit TribesInput.ini, search for *F12* or *BugIt* and change or remove the line.

(Explanation on how to join)",82,8,85,http://www.reddit.com/r/Tribes/comments/v12ya/reddit_pugs_the_newer_shinier_way_to_pug/,"So, you played the game for a while and felt a hunger.  You searched for others with interest in the game and found r/tribes, you read up on the game and learned, and the hunger was abated.  Time has gone on, and the hunger has returned.  The public matches are getting stale, your opponents are usually far beneath your skill, so much so that they make it hard to play a good match.  The randomness is getting to you, and you want more.  This is natural, it is showing you that it is time for you to move on.  To face others with a similar, goal-orientated mind set.  It is time to PuG.

In light of the recent posts consisting of some variant on ""Looking to pug with you guys!"" and the spinfusor.org [article](http://www.spinfusor.org/2012/06/13/perpetual-newbdom-the-scenes-teamstacking-and-the-perception-of-balance/) on casual/competitive scenes, I have decided to try and make a one-stop-shop for the pug information.

PuGs should not be a scary thing, they are just a way to play the game against others that actually want to play the objectives.  They are the next logical step to increase your skill at the game.

Joining a pug is simple, and I'm going to try and make it as streamlined as possible.

* Join the mumble at mumble.tribespugs.com port: 36085  Label it whatever you want, your username should be your tribes name. (Don't have mumble? You [should.](http://www.mumble.com))

* Make sure you have push-to-talk enabled^1, or your speach recognition well configured.  The random breathing/noises will annoy many people.

* Right click-&gt;self-&gt;change comment.  Put in order your main roles (capper, chaser, offense, defense, HoF). Not really needed, but is useful if there are 20 cappers and no defense to see what else people play.

* Search through the channels for your region^2 and the role you want to show off or practice, and hop in.

* Wait for some games to start and have some fun.

If there is no one on, don't panic.  People usually start to pug in the NAeast servers around 8 pm EST.  If they are already in game, just hang out.  After two games, they will come back to the roles and repick.

General rules:

* **Friendly Fire is on.**

* Jackal, smoke grenades, plasma gun~~(/cannon?)~~, and white outs are all banned.

* Sentinels: one per team, unless the teams are over 10 players each.  Then two are allowed.

* No upgrading base assets.

* Shrikes: one per team, cost 9000 credits.

* Call ins: No tactical or orbital strikes. Bonus reputation for killing someone with an inventory station.

Good luck, and have fun.

^1 Right click-&gt;Configure-&gt;Settings.  Put on push-to-talk for transmission.  Go to Shortcuts, Add, then put on push-to-talk with your prefered button. 

^2 The Reddit pugs only do NA games at this time.  If you are from Europe, the reddit pugs have merged with the spinfusor.org pugs.  Please head over to their mumble, information can be found [here.](http://www.spinfusor.org/the-community-mumble/)

Edit: Fixed that error with the mumble address, thats what I get for copy and pasting some random guys comment. Also, plasma cannon is allowed.

Now that the EUTL House League Grand Finals have finished, I am stepping away from T:A.

Now, this is not due to any particular reason, person, or change. It is a culmination of things. But more so, it's a necessity for me. After all the time I've spent struggling, I've finally gotten my life back on track. I have a job, I'm healthy, and the rest I'm still working on. So, my time must be focused on RL. As I've told so many of you when I've spoken to you about any sort of casting or anything else, you can attest that I have always said, ""RL comes first."" It's time for me to stay true to my own words via action. It will be put first for me, from here on out.
*****
I've had a fantastic time playing, casting, and building what we have with this community. I've met people who will likely be life-long friends. 

With that being said, I won't completely disappear immediately. I'll be around in a very minor operating capacity. Mainly to nudge along TCN as it continues its coverage of T:A and help guide the next generation (har har) of casters, cameramen, and production. In essence, I'm handing off the torch as it was handed to me.

Though, once everything is set in place, my contribution and presence will gradually fade further. From day one, I wanted TCN to basically be autonomously run by the community, not by someone at the top. And it is coming remarkably close to that. Only a few steps left.
*****
Unfortunately, this does mean no more Beermania, no more Monday night casts from me, no more getting to watch minimiCs kill people (which sucks so bad), no more competitions with APC on who is better looking, no more FIKA for me, no more NATL updates on the TA channel with Anarchy and myself, and no more honorfusor at night with Mamacita.
*****
I wanted to thank all of you who had given me criticisms, helping hands, and sometimes just someone to vent to. I know we all need those at times. I'll miss a lot of this community, but it's time for me to go.

Need help trying to to get the crosshair&amp;2D markers tuned for SBS 3D.,82,11,57,http://www.reddit.com/r/Tribes/comments/1it33x/got_ascend_working_w_oculus_rift_it_looksfeels/,"I'm really excited about getting this fully functional, great game, I could tell as soon as I put the Rift on in game that it's an awesome fit for XxXtreme VR. The body awareness looking down at your legs while your skiing is nice. Surprisingly when moving at the fastest speeds sliding around the map like a mad man I felt zero motion sickness but I'm pretty tolerant to VR naturally. 

HOW TO:

Use the Stereoificator (I've had a lot more luck with it than the standard Vireio injection driver it's a fork of) http://www.chrisdrain.com/hmd-stereoificator/

Add this below your last game in the profile.xml: &lt;profile game_name=""Tribes"" game_exe=""TribesAscend.exe"" shaderModRules=""unreal.xml"" rollEnabled=""true"" worldScaleFactor=""3.5"" /&gt;

Add this after your last game in the users.xml: &lt;game game_name=""Tribes"" horizontalFoV=""110"" separationAdjustment=""-0.001"" swap_eyes=""true"" yaw_multiplier=""25"" pitch_multiplier=""25"" roll_multiplier=""1"" /&gt;

insert the 3 dlls in your bin into the Tribes Ascend folder that has your TribesAscend.Exe

Set your field of view to 110. Turn off all the hud settings and crosshair for now. Turn your graphics settings in game to the lowest setting (I tried just keeping it high and disabling dynamic shadows, lights, ambient and blur but something still trips up when it's on the highest setting. But, it still looks really good in the Rift with texture detail on high.

Now, trying to get a workable crosshair and get the 2d player, flag, base markers to be kosher with SBS 3D is the only problem. I would gladly play it without, the projectile weapons are fine without a crosshair but spinfusing with a crosshair is already difficult as is. It's compatible with 3D Vision. I've read using 3d Vision the crosshair and all the 2d markers are fine. I set 3dVisionEnabled to True in the .ini and tried to launch it with blue red 3dVision, only difference was color changes in the menus.

I understand this was the first major tournament, so it's totally forgivable, but we really need to see more insightful analysis than a play-by-play rundown of something that is more easily understood just watching.

Part of the reason commentary works in real life team based games like football (american or european) is that the players can either be called by their number or have distinctive physical features that help everyone remember how they play and what they're usually doing. Not so for T:A. Listening to the rapid babbling of the commentators hopelessly trying to describe everything going on in a scene was a trainwreck. That time could have been so much better spent explaining the general tactics each team was using and, one day in the future, the characteristics and record of some key players onscreen.

If a fight over the flag is happening midfield, so what? There's almost always going to be something happening in the middle of the map, but other than ""some people are fighting and shooting,"" there's not much more insightful than that. Why not instead take the time to jump to the HoF, maybe (as T:A is still new) take the time to explain what he's doing there, and look at the nuances of how he prepares for the fight midfield to start moving toward him. Jump to the generators now and then and talk about how heavily the team's present strategy depends on the generator staying active. If so, what's the other team doing about that?

I don't want to hassle the commentators about it, because I know it's a new sport and no one really knows how to commentate yet, but I think it's important that these guys start outlining some key areas for improvement in the commentary.

To you guys out there who really, really love this game and the commentary couldn't matter less to you, I understand and am happy for you. But, for us regular folks who want to enjoy watching this with friends one day, the ability of commentators to give us a good picture of the game is really important to the eSport experience. Perhaps someone totally independent should be controlling the camera. Maybe we ought to have multiple cameras with the commentators choosing on the spot which should be shown at the time.

But nothing is more important than practical knowledge of the ""big picture"" of a game and the ability to analyze what's going on beyond just individual roles.

Postby mmerner » Fri Mar 08, 2013 12:03 pm
Erick,

I haven't played Tribes with any competitiveness since a time that all lag could firmly be blamed on a 56k dialup connection. I guess this day and age low latency and lack of lag is a much bigger deal :D. I'm going to try my best to explain what can be concluded from your network testing, though I suspect you may not like the end result.

First and foremost, you stated that the lag spikes and choppiness/warping is not a problem unique to yourself, but reported by a large subset of players. Unless all these players are on our network (I'd like to believe Sonic is that big, but sincerely doubt it), it leaves us with two options for the source of the lag. The first, is that there is a shared upstream provider (large intermediary internet backbone) used by both us and some other ISPs which is having some sort of ongoing routing issue. The second is there is an issue inside of Hi-Rez's network or servers. I would suspect it is their servers due to the fact they are the single (geographically diverse) commonality between all the problems. It is possible if they were running identical network architecture in both their datacenters, an network issue could arise in tandem at both locations but that is highly unlikely.

Your MTRs both seem accurate on latency to the given geographical locations of the 2 Tribes servers. As toast0 correctly stated, ICMP (the protocol for network testing by ping and traceroute) is the first thing to be deprioritized by all routers if they are busy for any reason. Thus when you see latency spikes on a few hops in a traceroute, it does not actually indicate any problem. For there to be an actual issue, the latency spike would have to follow every single hop to the end of the traceroute/mtr. All of the data you have provided shows perfectly normal and decongested network paths. Now forward and return paths almost always take different routes so without return traceroutes from the Hi-Rez servers towards your IP, we have an incomplete view of your issue. If you can somehow get them to provide one to you, it could give more useful information, though I suspect that to be unlikely. The combination of forward and reverse traceroutes can be used to identify the exact location of a network issue when one exists, but as I don't see indication of one in the traceroutes you provided, trying to acquire a reverse would be a waste of time and energy.

If Hi-Rez provides any more specific information on what they believe the client ISP problem to be and/or how it manifests, I'd be more than happy to investigate more. As of right now, having reviewed your data, my personal opinion is that the problem likely lies with the servers themselves. The one key questions that comes to mind is, does everyone on the server experience the chop/warp at exactly the same time?

People have asked for a donation link and I cannot afford to pay for any further expansion right now so I have set up [this page](http://tribespug.chipin.com/tribes-ascend-pug) for anyone who would like to donate.  Donations are much appreciated.  All financial information will be made public, you can view the financials so far on the donation page.

For anyone wishing to play some PUGs we will be starting tonight as soon as we have enough players so hop on mumble to join.

Our road-map for the future is as follows:

1. Expand too two more NA servers.
2. Increase mumble too 100-slots.
3. Set up an EU server.

Any Europeans if you would like to donate for a EU server please do so above and send me an e-mail at tribesascendpug [at] gmail [dot] com and your donation will be put aside for an EU server.  We will launch the EU server as soon as we have enough donations or Monday, May 21st whichever comes first.

Diamond Sword is like 50 times more awesome in ever way. The models alone are sleeker and appear to have a higher pixel count. And they have freaking swords! What do the blood guys even get? It is like a kitchen knife tapped to their hand. I can't even remember their name because they suck so much.  Diamond Sword soldier's have Mandalorian helmets and sword, it really doesn't get better than this. Especially compared to the red guys who's models appear to have been drafted in minecraft.

Whenever I enter a game I have to spam click the Diamond swords because that is who everyone picks. The one saving grace for playing red is that you get to hear: ""Diamond Sword has the flag"" Also, throughout the game you will be looking at diamond sword models while they kill you. A much more pleasing experience than shouting down red boxes.

I almost admitted defeat before figuring out how to open the editor in UDK. If you're someone like me who just wanted to mess around with maps (and make a big hill) then this guide should be a little easier on you.

***

First off, download this: http://www.filedropper.com/maptutorial

It's a package I made to make things a bit easier. It includes a basic [blank map with textured terrain, flag spawns, team spawns, and generators already placed on the map.](http://i.imgur.com/99e12no.jpg) It should build and start up in the dev client without errors.

***

Next you will need to download;

* The bin.torrent included in the package. (Tribes Dev Kit)

        You can also go here: https://github.com/AltimorTASDK/TASDK/blob/master/bin.torrent

* http://download.udk.com/UDKInstall-2011-01-BETA.exe (UDK)

Once UDK is installed, continue to the next step!

***

The next two steps (stolen from the old guide) are pretty straight forward.

* Put the folder 'TribesGame' that you extract from the .rar into (for example) C:\UDK\UDK-2011-01\Development\Src\. (I've included the same folder as the old guide, but with the addition of generators).

* Go to (for example) [C:\UDK\UDK-2011-01\UDKGame\Config\ and open UDKEngine.ini, search for UnrealEd.EditorEngine an at the end of that section, write ModEditPackages=TribesGame.](http://i.imgur.com/H95sDBB.png)

***

Next you're going to want to do is make a shortcut to open up the UDK editor. Go to the UDK installation location, and navigate to the 'Binaries' folder; (C:\...\UDK\Binaries\).

Right click on 'UDK.exe', and create a shortcut. Now edit the shortcut (Right click and hit properties), then add the word 'editor' (without quotes or a dash), to the end of the 'target' field. Should look something like

    C\UDK\Binaries\UDK.exe editor

Hit OK and double click to open the UDK editor. The first time you do this it will ask to rebuild outdated scripts. Hit 'Yes', and wait until it finishes (With a green 'Success'). For some reason it doesn't continue to open UDK, so you have to click that shortcut again.

***

VGW! You made it!

What you're probably seeing is a giant blue grid, or complete darkness (Depending on how far you're zoomed in). If you want to attempt to start from scratch, head on over to google and search UDK tutorials! If you just want to make a big hill, Load up the 'TrCTF-GenericMapBase.udk' included in this package, (File -&gt; Open). 

You should see a big grass square with a couple dots on it. If you can't, try moving around. There are a few ways to move, but the easiest is by holding down Right Click, and using WASD.

***

Before we edit the terrain; If you do not like the size of the terrain, [you can right click on the terrain and select 'Terrain Properties'.  Open up the 'Terrain' Dropdown menu (First one), and adjust 'Num Patches X', and 'Num Patches Y', to the desired size.](http://i.imgur.com/AXemxsZ.png) The next section has a more crude way of doing this.

***

To Edit the Terrain; [Open up the 'Terrain Editing Mode' (Hotkey: Shift-3).](http://i.imgur.com/fj6N4Cd.png)

There are a few different tools you can use.

* 'Add/Remove Sectors'. This lets you adjust the size of the terrain canvas.
* 'Paint' This lets you adjust the Height of the terrain, (Make hills/Craters).
* 'Flatten' This lets you bring the surrounding terrain, up to the height of the targeted area.
* 'Smooth' smoothes out jagged edges.
* 'Average' averages the height of the targeted terrain area. I find using this tool with the 'Strength' set to 1 or 2, better than the smoothing tool to blend terrain together.
* 'Noise' - not good for gaining sanics.
* 'Visibility' Punches holes in the terrain, used so there isn't terrain blocking the conduits on Bella Omega ect ect.
* That's all I've experimented with.

You make use of all these, by selecting them, moving the Terrain Editor to the side, then using Ctrl+Click (Left to increase, Right to decrease) on the map itself.

*You can set the value of 'Strength/Radius/Falloff' way past what the sliders allow by typing into the field manually.

***

The map I've provided already has the Flags, Spawns, and Generators for each team placed. You've probably noticed how you can't see them. That's because we don't have the actual models and textures that come with tribes. A bit of a workaround is in place.

UDK has 'fake' script files in place (The ones included in the TribesGame.rar), these define all the objects in them (flags/gens/inv) as 'PointLights' (which is a simple light source). The Tribes Client has it's own script files, which define these as the real deal (textured/animated objects). So when the map is loaded in UDK, it shows the assets as point lights, but when loaded up in the Tribes Dev Client, it will show as the actual flag/generator/inven station.

Anyway. To move these objects, you must first select them. The easiest way to do this is to 'Find Actors'. Hit 'Edit -&gt; Find Actors'.

For the map included, it should show a list of the following 'actors';

* Brush_0
* Terrain_0
* TrCTFBase_BloodEagle_0
* TrCTFBase_DiamondSword_0
* TrPowerGenerator_BloodEagle_0
* TrPowerGenerator_DiamondSword_0
* UTTeamPlayerStart_0 (Blood Eagle)
* UTTeamPlayerStart_1 (Diamond Sword)
* WorldInfo_0

You can double click any of these or select it and hit 'Go To', which will bring you to the object. If you are in the correct selection mode (Translation Mode), you will be able to adjust the position of the object by using the arrows to move them on their respective planes.

To change selection modes, [click on the toolbar buttons under 'Tools' and 'Help'. The icons look like a regular Mouse Pointer/Rotate Arrow/Resize Icon.](http://i.imgur.com/UjpcH4z.png)

***

The map file included does not have Inventory stations spawns. I haven't messed around with them yet. If you want them, you'll have to place them yourself. Here is how;

* [Go to the Content Browser, it is the icon on the toolbar between the Binoculars, and the green 'K'. (Hotkey: Ctrl+Shift+F)](http://i.imgur.com/YlrtwxD.png)
* Select the 'Actor Classes' tab. 
* Search: Inventory
* [Click on 'TrInventoryStation' or 'TrInventoryStation_Neutral' then click and drag them onto the map.](http://i.imgur.com/ETZitUU.png)
* Pray they work in the Dev Client

***

When you're ready to test your map with the Tribes Dev Build, make sure to first Build your map (Build menu -&gt; Build All). Then save your map.

*If you do not 'Save As', it will overwrite the file in this package. Just a heads up if you want to save a backup.*

Next, you must copy/paste the map file (TrCTF-GenericMapBase.udk), or whatever you saved it as, and put it into the Tribes Dev Build map folder. (C:\TribesDevBuild\bin\TribesGame\CookedPC\Maps\).

Time for another shortcut. Go to the 'Binaries' folder of your TRIBES DEV BUILD (C:\TribesDevBuild\bin\Binaries\Win32\). Make a shortcut to TribesAscend.exe, then edit the shortcut by adding 'TrCTF-GenericMapBase -seekfreeloading' without quotations, to the end of the target field. Should look something like this;

    C:\TribesDevBuild\bin\Binaries\Win32\TribesAscend.exe TrCTF-GenericMapBase -seekfreeloading

Hit OK and double click the shortcut. The client should loadup, and you should spawn directly into the map.

***

Few extra notes;

* Once you're ingame, if you want to join an actual team. Open up the console and type; 'ChangeTeam BloodEagle' or 'ChangeTeam DiamondSword' without quotations.
 * Note note; The console commands don't work in chat even though the dropdown menu pops up to autofill.

* If you  renamed the map file; keep in mind that in order for the tribes client to run the map as CTF, you must have 'TrCTF-' as a prefix, or you'll just end up ingame without a gun or UI.

* If you add more objects; since they are light sources, remember to disable the lighting in properties. This will prevent UDK from building light maps for them.

* If you  add more textures and objects from the content browser to your map (Skybox ect), you must make a copy in your map package, and use that copy instead. If you do not, you'll get errors when you try to start it up in the dev build.

I also noticed he claimed to have 1600HP, but two 840 damage thumpers failed to kill him. This was in a private server, and when testing it out his AR shot did 108 and my gast did ~60 damage. It seems that when hirez removed the level cap on arena, they made it so low level players put out more damage while taking less from high level players. This was tried out in a pub server and a private server. Now, my question is- has HiRez ever mentioned this?

TL;DR - Low levels do more damage to high ranked players in arena, also take less damage from high level players

The wiki has plenty of information, but we need more tactics and pictures on a number of pages. Signing up is optional and only takes a second, then you can start giving the community your strategies and helping new players.

All the new weapons need plenty of tactics. Create a new bulletpoint and write it under the ""tactics"" section of each weapon. If it does not exist, make it by typing ==Tactics== and writing underneath it. For more complex tactics, such as comparisons with other weapons, you may make an entirely new line. An example is shown on the [BXT1 page](http://www.tribesascendwiki.com/BXT1_Rifle), comparing it to the phase rifle.

Not all the articles are written in 3rd person at the moment, but we at the wiki are trying it make it more wiki-like as we go. Try to write your pages in 3rd person and use good vocabulary, punctuation, and grammar. You don't have to be a perfect writer; as long as you can write up something that doesn't sound like a fifth grader wrote it, you will be fine.

**Specific requests:**

- We could really use a clear picture of the BXT1-A rifle. This likely means that you will have to have it unlocked OR not have the sentinel class unlocked since the price tag slightly obscures it. Cutting a small amount of the bottom off due to the upgrade text is fine, but not half of it. You can either crop and submit it yourself or just send me the rough image in a reddit message and I'll crop and submit it instead, it's up to you.

- We need the price values for a number of raider weapons.

- We need updated automatic weapon damage values on a few of the automatics. 

- We need a number of [roles](http://www.tribesascendwiki.com/Roles) added. If you play one of these roles please submit some tips so that new players can learn.

- Most of the price tables need updating. They can be found on each class' page.

Over the past year, Hi-Rez has noticed an increasing trend in our players and many other online gaming communities. More and more players use social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Twitch, and Reddit to connect and discuss their entertainment of choice. Consequently, fewer players visit official forums long enough to even create an account. In keeping with this observed tendency, Hi-Rez has shifted focus to those social media platforms increasingly over the course of the year.

Within no more than 24 hours from the time of this post, another step will be taken toward focusing communication on social media platforms. The official forums will no longer be available. To continue discussing Hi-Rez games and initiatives within a forum-like setting, the established community sub-Reddits will be utilized.

Of course, we will continue to interact with the community through our own live streams and community-based channels. We also plan to have more YouTube content that will increase connectivity between Hi-Rez staff and players. Stay informed by following all of the social media platforms for the Hi-Rez game(s) you play!

----------------

ignore ""we'll interact with the community"", ""more youtube content"" etc etc. the entire blog is pretty much a copy and paste from Smite blog and isn't meant for Tribes players.

----------------

edit: this is probably a good time to copy tutorials from the forum. they've had several good ones.

3 months",76,14,40,http://www.reddit.com/r/Tribes/comments/xx0s5/what_was_fixed_on_the_ui_during_the_last_3_months/,"Remember [that big post about fixing the UI from 3 months ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/Tribes/comments/t7bfw/hey_hirez_stop_doing_content_packs_and_fix_the_ui/)? Plenty of time, right? Let's see what was actually fixed.

Fixed things will be ~~stroked through~~, I haven't played much and might have missed some things so please do comment when you notice something!

Added things will be **bold**. They might have been present 3 months before, but they weren't in the list.

--------

Most Recent Match History    

* shows only 1 match (and only if you haven't closed the client, or else it shows nothing, not even an error message)
* doesn't show the match ID
* doesn't show how long the players have been in the game (time played divided by match length as a percentage would be nice)
* doesn't show a player's most played class that round
* doesn't show the map it was played on (come on, really?)
* shows little rank icons which no one has memorized; show  the number instead
* no *back* button
* date is always 2/12/12
* accolades in the rightmost places which are in triple digits have their units and tens cut off
* doesn't highlight own name

Player Overview

* ~~Win/Loss ratio is present but not calculated~~
* no text on the most recent awards (am I again expected to memorize icons?)
* Flag Defense and Flag Caps are random numbers (they both seem to be the amount of flag defenses I've made, currently 1115 and I got the obsidian flag defense [1k] yesterday)
* More stats would be appreciated, esp. break downs per map

Badges

* Switching the page of badges triggers the menu transition animations

Class Edit UI

* The transition animation is way too long (especielly bothersome when managing class upgrades and friends list) and should be optional
* ~~No saveable loadouts~~ yay monetization!
* when viewing a class, it's not apparent which items are already maxed out

Loading Screen

* doesn't show an image of the upcoming map (which has been industry standard for years)

~~VGS~~

* ~~VU**T** -&gt; Upgrade **S**ensors~~
* ~~VU**S** -&gt; Upgrade **T**urrets~~

Settings

* ~~VGS and Announcer volume level settings reset on logout~~
* Chat filter setting resets on logout
* ~~enable/disable Chat HUD option not seperate from Class Selection/Modification HUD notification. (You cant disable chat without disabling the notifications of hotkey presses for class changing~~

Combat UI

* ~~deployables counter broken~~
* 3rd person camera height (which is useful for close combat due to higher FOV) doesn't take into account the player model and is not useful for heavy classes
* add icons for turrets and sensors next to the generator icon
* ~~own team is always blue, enemy team is always red, **but** Sandrakers always have blue icons and Butchers always have red icons~~
* ~~when there is a vote to kick someone there's a prompt that says F5 = No; F6 = Yes, but it is actually F6 = No and F7 = Yes~~
* time left on team selection is always 10:35
* there's no indication (neither visual nor audio) how long it takes for claymores to be primed (it's about 2 seconds); ~~and while we're at it, there's a bug where the claymore explodes if you walk over it before it's primed~~
* ~~icons for *call ins* (tactital, supply, orbital) don't update properly with current amount of credits~~
* ~~after opening a menu via shortcut (e.g. J for friends list), the escape key loops between the class menu and the main menu, not exiting back to the game and requiring a mouse click to the bottom left~~
* Kill details cover up VGS http://i.imgur.com/IM6SP.jpg
* UI elements cover up the flag marker http://i.imgur.com/DbFOg.jpg
* **Called targets (with ALT) are marked as being light armor, regardless of type**

Scoreboard

* **ping is next to score which makes it a tad harder to distinguish in the heat of the moment**

Spectating

* **First person spectating does not have weapon model and crosshair**
* **In spectating, it always indicates the weapons the target is carrying as the stock weapons.**
* the *time until next health regen* is fixed at 204 seconds

Training - Target Practice

* Most bots have the symbol for heavy armor, regardless of their armor type. Since tutorials are for noobs, that's extra confusing.

General

* The UI looks like it was made for a console. The class edit could greatly benefit from a UI where you can edit your loadout of a class in just one page.

Before I get into what is needed I am going to link a screenshot of the activity on the paypal so you all know what your money has been spent on in the past.  You can find that [here](http://imgur.com/BM4JX).  The names of anyone who donated have been blacked out for obvious reasons.

Currently our money is being spent on two things mumble and tribes servers we have six tribes servers: 1-3 are normal ctf, 4 is pathfinder LT and 2 are Newbloods servers.  They will expire as follows: 2 newbloods servers in 5 days, 3 &amp; 4 in 25 days and 1 &amp; 2 in 31 days.  The reason we are collecting donations too renew all the servers now is too buy the largest gold pack available to extend all servers for the cheapest price.

The breakdown of how the money will be spent is as follows:

$50 for 7500 tribes gold, this allows us to renew all 6 servers for 90 days as it costs 1200 gold to renew them this is a total of 7200 gold for all 6 servers.

$28 for one month renewal of the 200 slot mumble.  Although we do not often need more then 150 slots with the special events we did go over and as we plan to hold more events I feel the extra $7 is worth it.    The mumble renews on August 21st. This brings the total to $78.

The second donation is more long term, the objective is to raise $153 so we can rent the mumble server in six month chunks, if we do not reach the target this money will be used to renew mumble monthly and spare us having to do monthly donation drives.  I hope we will be able to collect this money by September 21st when our mumble will need to be renewed a second time.

As always thanks for all your support everyone.  Feel free to leave any feedback on the pickups in the thread below.

Edit: Fixed broken link.  Thanks everyone for your donations so far already getting close to our goal.

We have reached both our goals thank you to everyone for supporting this.  This community is amazing that is over two hundred dollars raised in three hours.

It seems like every time I visit /r/tribes it is dotted with posts about how the game is dying and HiRez's refusal to update the game.  

So, here is the opinion of a random pub player: 

Tribes has one of the best communities out there. Sure, you can give me all the shit about the toxic things that have been done and said on the forums, irc, reddit, etc, but if you tell me that there is another community that is as invested in the survival of their beloved game than I would be forced to disagree. 

HiRez has created an environment where fostering a successful community is damn-near impossible but through the efforts of the community we did our best to keep it going. Everything good about this game is community-based. The majority of our problems are from HiRez's poor development and refusal to actual support and grow Tribes: Ascend as an Esport. 

So, this post is really just a thank you to every player that has invested some fraction of their time to helping Tribes become what it is today. Whether its casters, streamers, comp players, etc. you all made tribes that much more of an enjoyable experience for the players. 

I know a lot of players are fed up right now, and I just thought it would be nice to let them know that they did truly make my Tribes experience that much more enjoyable. 

So what's next? 

I think we should all do the best we can to make tribes work with what we do have. Now, if you are a player that has invested hours and hours of time into tribes I can understand your frustration and I am not saying that you have any obligation to play. I simply mean to say that if you still find some joy in tribes lets just play and have some fun with what we do have.",,False,self,t5_2rdsl,False,,,True,t3_1i0u8e,http://www.reddit.com/r/Tribes/comments/1i0u8e/the_state_of_tribes_through_the_eyes_of_a_random/,

These are both run by awesome people and provide some different aspects based on what the player wants to do.

**AnRedditTribe.**
http://www.reddit.com/r/anreddittribe and their mumble  mumble.anreddittribe.net:34883

A great community that is very very welcoming of new players and casuals alike. Anyone can stop by the mumble, hop into a channel and play some public games. You can expect a bit more organization then you standard PUB, while still having fun and doing whatever you want. Also, you can sometimes find some fun grav cycle racing, or other random crazy antics. It's a fun place where players are just looking to laugh and have a good time. Recommend this to people that...

* Are looking for more people to play with

* A gaming community

* New, and looking to get better

* Those frustrated with disorganization of Public games

* Players that want to do fun out-of-the-ordinary tactics

* Players that want to create fun game modes like shrike tag

There is also the **RedditPugs** which are opening up. These are a bit different, as it's a organized(ish) team playing against another organized(ish) team. Players are given specific roles to play (offense, defense, capper, etc.) And are expected to play the roles a general way. They like to teach people how to play and offer advice to anyone willing to learn. The big difference here is there are more defined specifics on how to play these roles. While no one will tell you that playing offensive technician is ""bad"" you would probably get the recommendation that the raider may do the job better. This is a great middle ground for players that want to test the waters of competitive play, or those that are looking to play in a team and try out tournaments.
You should recommend this to players that...

* Want to play competitively

* Are bored in normal Public games

* Are constantly ""top of the chart"" and want to know where to play against better players

* Want to play a specific role in a team (I love capping but hate how in pubs I'm always Llama'd while I'm going 300+ sanics!!!)

* Are trying to maximize their talent and find their potential

* Test their skills against strong players

In the end, both places are very friendly and accepting of newer players. If you haven't tried a PUG absolutely hop in and give it a go! If it's not your thing, or if you like just playing casually absolutely check out the anreddittribe!

Then that same scenario repeats another 3 times, with some minor variations in that sometimes some friendly PTH who's late to the action flies in and grabs the flag from under my nose.

So I successfully chased 4 times during a match, which I think is not bad for a noob, yet we still lost and I'm in the bottom half of the charts.

This file holds a lot of information which will allow you to drop your graphics significantly lower than the ""minimal"" setting. I have perfected this .ini and edited it repeatedly to get optimal low end settings. [This link describes what every single line in the .ini file does!]( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/lv?key=0AoLRo1M6-ypfdGtwVExZd2lHN3JuellwMTZndkJOZVE) 

A lot of people have been asking how to get better performance. This Tribes.ini setup sets your graphics to be SIGNIFICANTLY lower than minimal settings. This is explicitly for people struggling with 20 - 30 fps when using minimal settings, and should boost them to around 45 fps.

Notes

How to use:

Find your Tribes.ini file and make a copy of it. Place it on your desktop and DO NOT touch it! This will be your backup. Then, open your Tribes.ini file that is in your config folder and replace all of the text inside with the following information. When you start your game, the resolution will be set to 800x600. Change this resolution in game if needed. Increasing resolution greatly affects performance, so keep it fairly low. Enter a game! If the graphics are too low for your liking, simply delete your edited Tribes.ini file and drag the Tribes.ini file on your desktop into your config file! All settings will be back to your previous setup.

DynamicLights Can be set to False (Default is True) to gain 5 to 10 FPS, however, it makes most maps very dark and depressing, also making it very difficult to see enemies at reasonably far distances.

OneFrameThreadLag=False GREATLY increases mouse responsiveness, but at the expense of a few FPS. In my experience, this line is crucial and worth the hit in performance if you want to be skilled with automatic weapons.

What if we had a canyons'n'mesa map that used the same style of exposed rock formation. All points of the same altitude would have the same layer of rock across the map. It could make it more interesting to guesstimate distances and see more clearly where you are going to land.

Plus it would just look dead sexy.

Most of you saw on the Dev Blog that my goal for the next patch is to have 2 CTF maps. I’m pleased to say that the “KatArx” map has been playing well, and the majority of the community has expressed approval and support from seeing the teaser images. I know that pics don’t really reflect gameplay, but it’s still great to be able to get feedback and address concerns early on.

Recently, a lot of people have called for Rollercoaster to be the second map made. It is being considered, but I wanted to fish around and see what other maps people would like to see. Personally, I enjoy making original maps- there is less “pressure” to get everything right and appeal to players’ nostalgia of classic maps. So I suppose my question(s) is/are this:

*Should I tackle remaking another Legacy Map? Should I make an original? Should I make another Hybrid, like Katarx, that welds together elements of other well-known maps?*

And while we’re on the subject (just to help me plan out ideas) *what are some of your favorite art sets?* I am trying to not add new assets, so that I can add more map content and keep the patch sizes down.

------
Remember, I won’t be able to do everything that gets suggested here. Please don’t be offended if I pass over an idea in favor of something else, or if something doesn't get implemented. I’m trying to get an idea of what people are looking for, even though I know there’s a vast expanse of ideas that can be developed =)

The conversations here and in pub chat are bringing up the topic of Matchmaking more and more frequently.

To the best of my understanding, HiRez has stated that ""matchmaking is coming"" for quite a long time but have not followed through.  This is understandable, as they've had bigger fish to fry.

I personally believe that we as a community need to bring their attention to this issue as a more urgent matter.  The health of public games is a matter of critical importance to the future of the game.  And right now public games kind of suck.  Not all the time.  Sometimes they are great...but more often they are over in 8-10 minutes and end in a 5-0 run.

So let's talk about matchmaking and offer suggestions so that we can not only tell HiRez that we want matchmaking, but also offer suggestions on how to implement it.

Here are some of my suggestions:

1) Base matchmaking on ping, not a pre-assigned region.  Who cares what server you're on as long as the ping is acceptable for playing?  Personally I can bounce between US West and East.  I'm sure many players can also bounce between the Euro regions as well.  Why not just do away with the restriction entirely?  Some people may always end up on the same region, but ultimately it allows more flexibility

2) Enforce level caps on servers more strictly. Letting a high level player join with a friend on a lowbie server is fine...but there's no reason to let 5 level 20+s in there.   The game should really try to keep people within level ranges.  That won't always be practical, so it should be more of a guideline than a hard rule.  I realize that skill and rank are not necessarily equal.

3) Look at players' relevant stats.  Try to slot in players who prefer different classes.  Don't put in 5 SENs and 5 INFs.  Look for people with offensive and defensive accolades.  This will never be 100% accurate since many players switch around a lot, but it's worth a shot.


4) How do we feel about matchmaking choosing teams as well as servers?  I think if all the maps were mirrored it would be a non-issue.

Throw out your ideas.


Edit: Here are some of the ideas from other posters:

5) Slot players into a server with closest average rank to their own

6) Create a permanent public server list that people can join and form a community around.

7) More voting options for things like team mixing, map changes, votekicks, etc..",,False,self,t5_2rdsl,1340061851.0,,DSTA,True,t3_v89h4,http://www.reddit.com/r/Tribes/comments/v89h4/lets_talk_matchmaking/,
1338387344.0,56,self.Tribes,uc49g,Full list of profane words according to Tribes' WordFilter.dat,70,14,108,http://www.reddit.com/r/Tribes/comments/uc49g/full_list_of_profane_words_according_to_tribes/,"First off, the list: [http://pastebin.com/f9aMmsHX](http://pastebin.com/f9aMmsHX)  
The garbage in parentheses is the ""encrypted"" text, as found in the filter file.

So after seeing [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Tribes/comments/ubmkq/in_case_you_didnt_know_deleting_the_profanity/) earlier today, I got curious about the file itself. From looking at it, it didn't look too hard to decipher, so I gave it a shot.  
Turns out that it's a simple substitution cipher for the words themselves, but there's some more junk around them that I haven't bothered to investigate yet. For those who are interested, here's the substitution table:  
  
    A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P R S T U V W X Y Z  
    K H I N O L M B C @ A F G D E Z X Y ^ _ \ ] R S P  

So ""ASS"" becomes ""KYY"", etc. Note that Q is missing, because there are actually no filtered words that contain Q. The ASCII values seem to follow some sort of pattern of positive and negative changes of 10 and 6, so you could figure out what Q is supposed to be... but who cares.  
Also, Hi-Rez is apparently really concerned about Germans swearing in their game.

Most of the following is bullshit trying to explain intuition and luck -- don't apply 100%.**

I'll be adding stuff to this guide as I think of shit, so check back later.

I like lists and bullet points, sorry.


**How not to be so fucking awful at Tribes**

* **USE YOUR BRAIN, NOT YOUR AIM.**  My mechanics are p good, but a lot of people have better aim than me - I dumpster everyone in 1v1s because of proper positioning and prediction. I know where people will go and I know what weapon they'll use before they do.  If you're getting wrecked in a duel, after every death you should think 'where could I have been standing to not get dumpstered so hard.'

* (When HoFing) Stay on the stand; however, if you do go ham make sure to call it out so one of your teammates can go to stand w/ PTH for chase / stop llama.

* After breaking line of sight try not to approach from the same vector - If someone disappears behind a hill, don't chase directly after them - it's a great way to eat nades.  I like to screen to the left or right and then rengage.  If you break line of sight with a pillar, jet backwards while maintaining line of sight break.  People will usually shoot the base of the pillar, just on the other side if you go behind it. 

* Don't get into a straight DPS battle (don't jet at someone with chaingun while they're in the air or any situation where you're garaunted to take damage to give damage) if you have lower HP than your opponent.  If you get chunked in the beginning of a duel/on teh flag stand run away and press F.  Use your burst weapons when weak - Shoot your spinfusor/thumper/plasma/burst weapon, duck behind a LoS break (a pillar, hill, inv station, etc) as the weapon cycles then pop out when it's ready to shoot. 

* In adadada do not go left right left right left right.  You want to mix it up - left, stop, 200ms pause, left again, very long strafe right, short left etc.  You want to vary the lengths of your strafes.  Strafe for longer when fighting at far range. Don't strafe an inch to the left and an inch to the right, allowing your opponent to just aim in the middle and hit you with everything.  You must make longer strafes if you're in heavy.

* I constantly switch between strafe aiming and strafe dodging in adadada.  Strafe aiming is where you barely/don't move your mouse and aim with WASD.  I'll strafe aim until they hit a good burst then I'll go back to randomly strafing.

* When trying to get the last few shots on distance target, wiggle your mouse a bit to simulate a larger cone of fire - you don't need a long burst on him, just need to get a lucky hit.  When you're trying to get the last shot in an adadadadada at long distance I like to just aim in the middle of their strafe (ty bojinglebells for teaching me this).  

* You're not Reteris or Nullify.  Don't go for mid airs unless ABSOLUTELY necessary.  Reliable damage &gt; scrubby mid airs.  Take your time when aiming burst weapons - when I pull out my disk in an soldier adadadada I'll stop moving completely and momentarily pause to aim.  

* Save some bullets in your mag to chain opponent post ground pound - in adadada SLD duel I will shoot roughly 2/3 to 3/4 of my mag then switch to spinfusor to ground pound.  Your opponent will either jet away from disk and you can get ez pz 100% chain while he's in the air or he'll eat your disk and get knocked up into the air and you'll get ezpz chain.

* Keeping track of your opponent's ability to groundpound you is v important in dueling, especially soldier dueling.  Think of reloads as cool downs like League. If your opponent shoots a disk at you and then chains, he won't be able to ground pound you again for at least 3 seconds.  Do not jet up during this time.  Feel free to temporarily move to dangerous-to-ground-pound positions during this time (the little cubby just under each side of the bridge on walled in).

* If you have to jet to reposition yourself while getting raped by chain (think lava arena - you fell down to the second level outer ringer while someone is on top inner ring) start jetting when they have just a few bullets left in mag - hopefully they won't get a bead on you for very long before they have to reload and hope you land before they finish reloading.

* Pineapples are god.  Pineapples have inheritance, so use WASD + jet to control them.  Jet back and throw them if you want the nade to explode right when it arrives.  Or W + jet for max distance.  Throw grenades in pairs or more.  You want to leave a present in all the places someone can go after breaking LoS.  Do not throw grenaades when you're in someone's face.  They'll probably dodge it and it will dramatically reduce your overall DPS.  Try to throw grenades when out of LoS (so they don't see you throw it (the throwing animation is very distinct) and to limit their time to react). At low levels, nades (use frag XL on sld) can end a duel very quickly.  In high level dueling they are more of a positioning/area denial tool.  Use them to negate your opponent's positional advantage (e.g., you get knocked off main structure on walled in, throw nades at the edge so they can't peak down and rape you).  People can't count - try to save one nade for the end of a duel when they don't expect it.  If your opponent is keeping track of how many nades you have (like he should) he will be forced to play under the constant threat of the nade teh entire time.  I recomemnding rebinding yoour nade key you can press while pressing WASD and/or shoot.  You don't want a delay between holding m1 to shoot and tossing the nade, nor do you want to interrupt your adadadad/movement at all when throwing nade.  I use control.

* Your guns automatically reload if they're put away for 3 seconds.  Abuse this.  Throwing nades for 3 seconds does not count.  Don't get nervous and switch too soon, you'll probably die.  If in doubt, wait - eating 3~ more chain bullets probably won't kill you, missing the passive will.  

* Guns reload faster than their animation.  Try to cut the animation when posible (Press R, wait for ammo counter to update, then toss nade/switch weapons)

* If there are players you need to keep track of and easily distinguish in game (cappers, infs, etc), add them to friends (and hope they add you) and remove the other players.  Their IFFs will be orange.  I'll do this to enemy cappers and my cappers.  It's nice to see if the enemy cap is midfield or something without having to read the name. 

* Rapidily press your zoom when spotting for cap.  If you spam it for a sec, enemy IFFs will pop up.  

* In comp, have your LD or sniper call down hidden invs near flag stand (on top of base on arx, behind stand on kata, etc) and have the HoF use his inv for on stand blocking.  It's much easier for a HoF to keep their INF up and they have a better view at the exact angle of past routes. 

* If you land right as you're being hit w/ an explosive, you will get pushed back less.  When hofing i'll jump up and down on flag and try to land right when capper's self clear comes.

* If you're getting knocked off teh flag stand and having trouble getting back up as HoF/LD/whatever, put an inv under on the ground (e.g., both side of flag stands on DX, understand on xfire).  

* In stand offs while a raider jammer, stand behind your flag carrier w/ your plasma gun out.  Watch for foot steps (if you have knifes out as inf you won't have footsteps on ANY map) and declocked INFs.  Shoot your plasma between INF and teammate to knock them apart.  STANDING BEHIND HIM WATCHING, NOT CHAINING AT THE 2 HP PTH THAT EVERYONE ELSE IS SHOOTING AT.  It also helps if you're on a hill, slightly above and behind flag carrier.

* As HoF, if INV is v close by and my capper is coming home w/ flag, I will switch into my Jugg Reach loadout if the flag is home, or into my soldier reach if they have my flag.  Reach doubles the range of flag grab.

* Use extended mortar on jug hof so you can 1 hit full health (1400hp) soldiers.

* Jug hand disks have infinite flight time - use it to spam from far away (I like to kill offensive INVs from stand).

* Mortars sometime stick to shrikes - if you're not doing anything else, shoot mortar at shrike even if within 2 sec flight det time.  

* When trying to hand a flag off to a teammate, for the love of god, stand right next to him.  Don't fucking try to toss that shit from 10 feet away, you're not esports.  This one will make me rage if you screw this up in a pug (F you hapster).  

* Hud elements take up a stupid amount of graphics horse power.  You can get a 30% boost by turning off all the HUD elements. I normally turn off everything I don't need, including team scores, ski bars, visor bars, visor damage, game messages, etc.

* Protip on beating me in a duel - I almost always strafe left once or twice before going for the ground pound in an adada (bad habit from when I only had F to switch weapons).  No one has ever exploited this properly.

* Shoot the flag into you, even if you don't see anyone coming toward it, in case there is an unseen enemy or INV near by.

* You can bait ground pounds by landing on someone momentarily then falling off it. 

**Shoutouts:**

**Tavarner** has been an invaluable source of analysis and number crunching.  I love every single one of his weapon analysises.  We go hard in the sperg together

Thank you **twitchey** for dueling with me for hours and hours and hours, you fucking nerd. &lt;3

Thank you **Sebaceous** for all our talks about dueling theory and making AHK scripts for me.

There's a bunch of typos, but I trust they taught you to read in llama school.  

Edit:

&lt;Voss&gt; btw mstarrrrr throwing disks dont have unlimited range

&lt;Voss&gt; they go slightly further than spinfusors

A tournament to get new players introduced to Tribes: Ascend competition!


**TL;DR** [There is a short how-to on newbloods.org / sandboxclan.net/newbloods &lt;-- click this!! It has big buttons!](http://sandboxclan.net/newbloods)


*Okay so a quick FAQ:*


* **I don't have a team, I don't know anyone that plays comp, I've never played comp before ... How could I possibly join a tournament!?**

Hah! Aren't you a downer! (no seriously, *shut it*) The process is simple, join up with the people in the Pickup group mumbles (one in NA and one in EU) where we are directing all new players. You can join some pugs and you can find people to create a team with!

* **I really, really, have no idea what I'm doing...**

That's normal, Tribes: Ascend is on-par with Starcraft in learning curve and complexity. It's impossible to be good without being bad first. We have many mentors standing by to explain to you even the very basics of tribes combat and competition. These people will be in the PUG mumbles.

* **All seems a bit short notice ..**

The teams that will be formed for this tournament will be new and inexperienced. Keeping this group together will be a hard thing to do. There will be a 'free agent' option so we can sub people in and out of teams. But we want these teams to at least survive until the tournament starts. This will also focus the people coming into the PUG community so they aren't spread out over many weeks (at which point interest will wane).


*And where to we go from here?*

So, [Sandboxclan.net](http://sandboxclan.net) is now most definitely live. We have a media library to help out new people, we have on-site mentors on the forums and we have a lot of up-and coming workshop sessions to help people with specific roles.

Since I've been playing tribes since about a week before the closed beta ended, I haven't seen it except on pictures.

So, I guess my question is, what was the real problem with it? I heard something about the gen room being too open, or was that the flag stand?

The thing is, it's not like the game has all perfect maps that everyone loves so they decided to cut out Bella because it was awful. Today there were instances where I was about to throw my computer against the wall because I was so angry with that damn Temple Ruins, but the fact is, there have been some great matches over there.

So it basically cancels itself out, imo at least.

TWL has been home to Tribes ladders in NA since the dawn of time, so moving away from it is not something to be taken lightly for sure. It has a lot of history and loyalty, flaws and all.

But it's be real here: TWL is a mess. There are a ton of dead teams on the ladder that have never been removed. Challenges can go unanswered for months while the teams dick around doing nothing. The rung system ignores match history and relative results with similarly skilled teams for determining ranks, preventing it from ever really resolving to a more accurate picture of which team is best.

GameShrine has a much more sophisticated ranking system, allows for multiple challenges at once, is actively maintained and ""cleaned"", and has a lot of other cool features that make it easier for teams to find matches and scrims (such as GameShrine Play). As a caster, I also find their stats tracking intriguing, making it easy for me to pull stats on each team and map, which makes for great content and helps tell the story of the match.

Technologically, I have to admit that GameShrine is the superior site. The only advantage that TWL has is history and legacy, but is it worth it if we keep having administration problems and weird rankings and missing out on useful stuff like multiple challenges and more sophisticated stats?

Moving to GameShrine would also have the effect of uniting the competitive scene under one site, making it the go-to place for competitive Tribes info. So there's that to keep in mind, too.

As long as NA can maintain independent self-government over its ruleset, I would be in favor of switching, but I'm just one guy. What say you, NA?

My main question would be if we could just port current rankings over, maybe even records, and then just go from there. Might not be possible to port records, but at least seed it with TWL rankings to begin with. I guess that's up to Lumberjack.

For my first 20 or so levels I pretty much did nothing but ca the flag and occasionally chase. I found myself getting frustrated with my team for not having the flag at the base when I had the enemy team's flag on our stand, for letting the enemy take ours right as I was about to cap, etc etc

So I decided to try and play some defense myself....holy shit. What I found was a completely different world than what I was used to. Prior to this my eonly experience with flag defense was the .2 seconds I saw as I sped by the enemy's, flag in hand, or the 5 seconds of respawn time from the POV of the HoF I had just stubbed my toe on. 

There is so much crazy shit going on around the flag stand that I was surprised at first how any could manage to stay alive for longer than 10 seconds, let alone defend that flag in any significant way. Dodging Heavy spam, avoiding Raider explosives (they have so fucking many!), looking out for INFs, and of course stopping the cappers all are dealth with by the 3-5 people defending the stand (also Sentinels that bother spotting enemies, I love you).

So yeah. That's about it. No game changing discussion here, just a little advice to try and make the 7th layer of Hell that we call pub games a little bit more bearable.

This is especially annoying when the score is tied (0-0 being the most frustrating). 

When both teams switch to juggernaut and hide in their generator rooms with the flag the map becomes completely unplayable. It's a damn shame too because the map is otherwise extremely well-crafted.  Unfortunately, all it takes is two people turtling away to ruin the map for everyone. 

I've tried so many different tactics to break these stalemates, everything from HOing as jugg/brute, sneaking in as an infiltrator, charging in as a raider, rallying my entire team to charge the gen room, and stuffing a beowulf in the entrance (this was especially useless). I'm convinced there is simply no way to defeat a team that is firmly entrenched with the flag in their generator room. 

I don't know how to solve this issue aside from redesigning the map and adding either a wider base entrance with no drop-off or adding an entirely new, separate tunnel into the generator room. I played a lot of T1 back in the day, and while turtling was always an issue back then too, I do not remember it ever being this bad. Does anyone remember how T1 avoided this issue?

They have no hard-counter at all.  They are nearly impossible to hit with anything other than Saber Launcher (which doesn't actually fly fast enough to do hit them), and even if you do manage to nail a Spinfuser shot, they don't go down.  They play better defense than anything else in the game.  They aren't fun to play against (I think this is important).

Shrikes completely destroy the dynamic in any game, because as soon as the other team buys one, your entire strategy has to revolve around it, and that's just plain bad balance.  Nuance goes down the drain, subtle movement progression disappears, defensive posture totally shifts.  It's the fucking nuclear option, and wahh wahhh wahhh yes I am crying about it.

Edit: I'd just like to add that I adore this game, and the only reason I'm posting is because Shrikes are the only thing that have ever made me just completely lose interest (granted, I always come back by the next day).  I was just playing with 4 pals on Vent, and one good Shrike pilot caused us to go from having a great time to calling it quits for the evening.

Edit2: Clarifying that this is doubtless a far more concerning balance issue when viewed in the context of pubs than it is for Comp players.  Even if I was a dominant Shrike-harasser (via SMG, disc, or otherwise), a competent pilot would simply avoid me and go lay waste to other, less capable pubbers (not saying I am, in fact I'm pretty bad at dealing with them right now).  Whereas in a Comp game, I'm sure that once a Shrike appears, strategy shifts immediately (and cohesively) in order to deal with it.

When there is no one in a certain radius near the flag, an exclamation point (or whatever would fit) shows up next to the flag icon, and the announcer says 'The Diamond Sword/Our Flag is Undefended!'

That way, EVERYONE knows that there's no one at your flag, which should raise the hairs on the back of people's necks pretty bad on your team, and rally the other team into action.

What this solves:

An overweight Offense on your team.

An overweight Defense on the other team.

Issue 1: Hi-Rez.

But a less crappy answer...

Hi-Rez tried to modernise the game and its mechanics... and failed.  Most of the changes were made to make it ""more CoD friendly"" (their words.)  They didn't realise what they were doing.

1. Health Regen.  Tribes is a game of converting health into speed.  With the addition of health regen, time is converted into health, which is then converted into speed.  Hence, the longer your route, the faster you can go.  The defense do not get this additional time to generate speed, so it breaks the dynamic.  It means that larger maps, like Temple Ruins, just don't work, because cappers *have* to spend more time generating speed, meaning that they are ridiculously fast by default. Not to mention the effects of having a team of brutes in your gen regenerating to full health every 10s.  It also meant that snipers could sniper out cappers mid-route before their regen kicked in, further breaking the dynamic.  On a side note, rock bouncing also breaks the capping dynamic.  It completely destroys the risk/reward for grabbing the flag at different angles.  Fun mechanic or not...

2. Movement Physics.  Somebody coined the phrase, ""hard to gain speed, easy to keep it"" (or something similar.)  This means that if you're at a standstill, it is very hard to start moving.  Not only is this incredibly unfun, but it's hard to catch up to those pesky fast cappers, who not only have more time to convert into speed, but have an easy job of staying fast.  This lead to the need for ligthweight, rage, etc.  This is compounded by the terrible self-impulse.  This is the reverse of previous games where it was extremely easy to get moving, but hard to maintain a high speed.

3. Perks.  To quote Mabel: ""I don't see what needs to be said about it, it's pretty clear to anybody who's not complete trash at the game. Movement is the absolute core of the game, and deciding that only certain players on the map get to move quickly (ie Egocentric) breaks everything. This is exacerbated by 2 weapon loadouts and their terrible decisions wrt nitrons, regen, and damage/impulse ratios (which nitrons flagrantly ignore). The perks in the game are all terrible flat +stats, they're just lazy 'content' that add no real options (well, more like selectively partition options you had in previous games), which just breaks the game at every turn.""

4. Class system.  Hi-Rez chose to arbitrarily create a class system where each class had a static loadout with fewer weapons per loadout than previous games, completely ruining one of the core gameplay elements of previous games - the choice of weapons, packs, etc.  They improved it to the current system, but it's still woefully terrible in comparison.  Not allowing players to make their own loadouts has lead to a number of issues, mostly balance. Something the restricted classes was meant to avoid.

5. Weapon Mechanics.  The weapon mechanics essential served to pigeon-hole every single class into a certain limited number of roles.  2 weapons meant that classes were not as versatile as previous games, so that the game became a lot less dynamic.  The Sentinel can pretty much only snipe (or clear flag stands,) instead of also being an able chaser as well.  Not to mention the non-linear splash damage and removal of spin-up for all autos.  The butchering of weapon inheritance and projectile speed (which were initially different for virtually every weapon making it extremely hard to play multiple classes.)  Massively increased weapon switch time and main-hand hand-grenades (cannot be used at the same time as equipped weapon) with far too large of an explosion radius also served to 1-dimensionalise combat.

6. Teamwork Aids.  The lack of implementation of key teamwork aids meant that public play was severely restricted.  The *command circuit* from previous games, basically a large map with player locations on it, was extremely handy for coordinating.  Something severely lacking in the game at the moment.  Along with the command map, the waypoint system also allowed players mark incoming enemies or each other.  For instance, previously, saying ""take the flag from me"" would add a big glowing waypoint on that player, so everyone could easily see exactly where the person was needing assistance.  Hi-Rez added the spotting system instead, which was, and is, heavily abused to ""spam spot"" areas you think players may be, instead of using it to alert team mates of where players actually are.

7. Maps.  The maps were small, provided extremely poor performance and were woefully badly designed.  Gone are the large sweeping hills of previous games, welcome small maps with bumps, rather than hills, because the physics didn't allow anything else.  That and the removal of fog (because u can't have fog in games these days, right?) meant that snipers became a massive problem.  Maps needed line of sight blockers to help with that, but didn't really have any.  The maps are also awash with imbalances, such a Katabatic (a non-mirrored map,) Arx Novena (non-mirrored spawns) or Drydock (non-mirrored map with non-mirrored rocks.)  When older Tribes mechanics (such as core spawns) were introduced, we found that the maps were just not designed with them in mind and *didn't work at all*.  Don't get me wrong on this one, though.  Kate, KP, etc. did a very good job on the maps.  They were of very high quality.  They just didn't work too well in the context of the game... because the game is broken at its core.

8. Performance.  One of the key things these days, for a measure of the popularity of a game, is how many people are streaming and/or making videos of a game.  Unfortunately, the performance of the game is so poor that not many people could stream or record themselves.  If they could, the quality of said streams would be poor because the graphics were turned way down.  Not many videos appeared on youtube (compared with other games,) either.  Originally, the game didn't have any well optimized 'low' settings, and if you wanted good performance, you had to hack through inis to turn off settings.  This was a massive barrier for entry to anyone with a non-ninja system.  Additionally, the UI is **horribly optimized**.  I did a test on Drydock.  When turning off the UI, my fps increased by over 30%.

9. Demo Recording.  There just isn't any.  Hi-Rez broke demo playback in alpha and never went back to fix it.  Not only is this a key feature from previous titles in the franchise, it's also almost a requirement to be taken seriously for esports (due to cheating concerns) and, because the performance is so poor, one of the few ways that high-quality videos can be made.  It's also harder to make good montages/videos, because you can't go back and get shots from multiple angles.  It also doesn't allow casters to ""post-cast"" a game.  Demo recording is just such a key feature of a game, it was a blow when it was ""taken off the roadmap"" because a dev looked into it and said it was a ""blackhole of developer time.""

10. User Generated Content.  Hi-Rez decided to go with the *walled garden* approach for T:A.  This meant they had complete control over what exactly went into the game.  There was no UGC.  No custom maps, skins, mods, etc.  They claimed this is because of the F2P nature of the game.  Previous tribes games thrived in custom mods and maps.  As a small company with limited resources, they should have *made as much use of the community as they can*. A mapper for tribes once said, ""A good tribes map is more accident than intention.""  There were thousands of high quality maps made for previous titles.  Only a small subsection of them got played.  Why?  Because they were very hard to get right.  Very few people ever mastered the art.  Hi-Rez decided, in their infinite wisdom, to limit the map making to a few experienced udk mappers with *no tribes experience*, *no understanding of the game* and *no idea about competitive fps map making*.  The end result? See above. Not to mention, when asked why there wasn't user-made content, Hi-Rez answers, ""because UDK is not good for amateurs and you can't produce things as nice as we can.""

11. Servers.  Hi-Rez decided to, at their own expensive, host all the servers for T:A.  They were mostly *awful*.  Plagued with lag and packet loss.  Not quite as bad as MW2 with user-hosted servers, but not much better.  Not only were the servers themselves bad, but the organisation of them was bad, too.  Bad tiering (1-10, 9-50?) meant that as soon as people got out of the nooby zone, they were destroyed and stopped playing.  The management of the servers is also awful.  Full of bugs and bad design choices.  Let's consider the flag bounce bug, for instance.  Changing the physics setting on your custom server makes the flag bounce wildly.  You cannot undo it.  Once you've changed the setting, that server is broken forever.  It will *never* be fixed, because Hi-Rez has dropped the game.  On top of this, you are limited to 8 servers and cannot delete them once created.  If you fill up your 8 slots with broken servers, *you must start a new account to create usable servers*.  And, of course, you cannot transfer gold to that new account...  And you can only have 8 maps on the server, yet there are 16 or so maps available for CTF.  Bad design all over.

12. New Player Support.  There wasn't any.  End of story.  Game designed to get cod players, but didn't help them into the game at all.  No proper tutorials, etc. Surprised when they left?  I wasn't.

13. Bugs.  Initially in alpha and beta, bugs were fixed on a pretty regular basis.  In the last year or so, it's taken much longer for simple hotfixes.  A game crash bug in the server browser went unfixed for months and was a major contributer to the break-up of the Oceanic scene.

14. Community Feedback.  While they listened to some, most was ignored.  Anything that didn't fit their ""vision"" for the game was glossed over.  When they asked the top competitive teams what should be done to fix the game, the only change that came out of it was the one thing they said would be a terrible idea for a temporary fix... which became a permanent game mechanic.

15. Vehicles.  Grav cycle, a lot of fun.  Well done!  Everything else about the vehicle system, terrible.  Vehicles became ""I win"" buttons, not tactical options.  They promote skill-less spam play, instead of being considered, skillful options.

16. Call-Ins.  Do I really have to say anything on this?

17. Spectator Mode.  Poorly implemented from the get go.  More bad design decisions, such as large ui elements that block vision and are entirely not needed or the fact that, when a flag returns to its stand, you follow it with the camera.  If you're following a flag, you're following a play, not the flag itself.  When the flag is capped or returned, you want to continue watching that play unfold, not zoom across the map.  And if you do want to zoom across the map, you can press f+lmb.  And let's not forget the bugs, or just things never implemented.  It's all pretty tragic.

Things new to the franchise which would have been cool:

1. Matchmaking / Ranked.  Some sort of ladder or mmr rating.  And everything that goes with it.  Team/pug queuing, 7v7 ranked queues, etc.

1366105286.0,55,self.Tribes,1cgatx,It's The Little Things,61,6,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/Tribes/comments/1cgatx/its_the_little_things/,"I've been playing T:A off and on since open beta started. I'm not the best, but I'm not bad, either. That's not the point here, though.

There are little things in the game that bug me. Not bugs, necessarily, but stuff that hasn't been addressed, despite the game's relative age and seeming maturity. It's the little details that can make an experience truly worthwhile, stuff that can show the dev team is paying attention to their game and wants it to succeed. I don't know if they care as much about this game as their other/upcoming titles anymore, but as they continue to keep the game alive, I think a little tidying up is in order.

**1. Menu.** It's a hassle to navigate even for someone who uses it often. It doesn't have to be flashy: it only has to make sense. There's a tree structure going on behind the scenes that's mostly hidden from view, and keeping the tree in your mind as you drill into the thing to change the option you want can be a frustrating chore. Please attempt some kind of re-design.

**2. Loading Screen.** I don't think it's too much to ask to have a different screenshot for each map being loaded. They're not all Drydock, and the name of the map is already prominently displayed on said loading screen. Just hit printscreen once per map, make a little update, and we're set.

**3. Killed by ""Weapon"".** This happens when you run into someone who's using Super Heavy. You could just as easily say I died to a Body Block, or X Person's Chestplate, or High Speed Bear Hugs. I don't care, just say something different than Weapon.

**4. ""V Destroyed"".** On the scoreboard, there's a stat for destroying ""V"". Wtf is a ""V"", perchance? Ostensibly, it refers to killing base assets, turrets, force fields, etc. Maybe you could say ""Deployables Destroyed"", or ""Assets Destroyed"". That's not too many letters, right?

**5. Match time.** There's a space on said scoreboard for the Match Time and Match Number. During beta, I figured this was a placeholder for some stat-tracking system, or maybe a cool match playback feature. Well, it's been over a year into the game's actual, released lifespan, and neither does such a system exist nor does any functioning use for that piece of the scoreboard. Either make use of it or hide it: please don't leave erroneous text implying something you don't offer.

**6. Console chat.** Again, something I figured was placeholder until the end of beta, and it's still around. I can't even *see* the normal chat when the scoreboard is up, forcing me to use the abomination that is the console display. Heaven forbid I forget to turn it off before a map switch, or it's stuck on the screen during the map load.

**7. JK.** The default key for the friends list is J. The default for killing oneself is K, immediately next to it. You may not like your friends, HiRez, but you don't have to nearly kill yourself when you think about them. Conversely, if I want to ""K out"", as they say, I would rather not accidentally pull up that list when my finger slips and waste those precious seconds (especially for a game that intends to be ""FAST!"", seconds count). Sure, I could change the setting, but you've set the stage for others to fail before they, in turn, discover how to manipulate your game's controls better than you. (And why is there a key for the menu on M? We have an ESC key, and we know how to use it.)

**8. Tutorials.** Ok, this may not be a ""little"" thing, but it's a thing. New players will begin to judge the experience in Tribes based on two things: the first game they play and the tutorial missions. One of those you cannot control, the other you *exclusively* control. One should get back to the drawing board on those tutorials and show some of the skills we've developed over the years, including skills we learned in *past* games like disc jumping. As it stands, the only way a new player will learn anything is by getting their head out of the clouds and listen to the community, which is a tough thing to ask without plastering it all over the interface. (By the way, I recommend creating some artificial lag in the Target Practice to simulate a real playing experience. Not much, just a ping of 50. Maybe then, noobs could learn to chain properly).

**9. Gameplay Announcements.** Knowing the flag was dropped is cool. Knowing some arse on the other team is on a killing streak during a CTF match is useless to me. Let me specify which messages I see, and for God's sake make it smaller: I don't need half my screen filling up with GIANT WHITE LETTERS every time the flag is touched. It's like driving a car with turn-by-turn directions written on the whole windshield for 5 seconds straight: it may be useful, but dammit I can't see- :wrapped around a tree:

Have I missed anything? Am I nuts for wanting a little attention to detail?

/rant, talk amongst yourselves.

============================

""Reliable. Versatile. Solid."" As Soldier took off his helmet, these words echoed in his head. They were the words of Albert Highers, 
Lord of The Wilderzone, when selling the latest bio-engineered 'Soldier Skin' to the masses. Fucking liar.

Soldier ruffled his greying hair with a gloved right hand, and could almost smell the death that still lay upon the leather. How many had that hand killed? Hundreds? Thousands? It didn't matter, there would be more. There were always more. And perhaps it was with subconscious reverence to such a thought, along with the lies of Highers, that had made Soldier commit the unforgivable sin just some twenty six minutes earlier...

""HEAVY HOSTILE, IN THE MIDFIELD!"" The laggy comms in Soldier's headset came crackling through, Sniper's words stirring a rush of emotions; excitement, fear, curiosity...but mainly helplessness. Soldier silently prayed to The Flag On High (which only that morning he had sworn to defend) that it would be Brute, awkwardly trying to ski over the hill before succumbing to a quick-drawing Thumper/Gast combo. But even then one well placed Devastating Spinfusor disc would leave Soldier crippled,and having equipped an extra nade wasn't going to change that.

Soldier stared at the brow of the hill. TWo seconds. Three seconds. It must be Brute, everyone else would have been here faster! Then Soldier's heart sank. A glowing light blue ball of death flew over the hill, before separating into three projectiles. Fuck.

Soldier jetted up and to his right, narrowly avoiding the splash of the Mirv. He switched to his rifle, hoping to plough a few shots into Jug
before the heavy had time to engage. If only. Jug emerged from behind the hill, X1 in hand, and was slowly draining Soldier's life away as he 
tried to midair strafe. If only Soldier could land, the seemingly never ending chain would end. He switched to the Thumper, spotting that Jug was falling to Earth, and connected with a direct hit to Jug's face. ""I can do this!"" Soldier thought, as he quick-drew his Gast ready for his imminent landing, and the inevitable jet into the air from Jug. Soldier landed, started to strafe, and Jug lifted into the air. ""Got ya you son of a bitch!"" continued Soldier's inner monologue.

The X1 bullets started to miss. ""Reliable. Versatile. Solid"" Highers' words rang in Soldier's mind as he prepared to mirror Jug's movement and send him back to the arms of the Flag Creator. The X1 fire stopped for less than a second, and soldier felt reassured; what was Jug going to do, Mirv him?? Soldier almost afforded a smile as he engaged his jetpack.

Soldier shuddered, and opened his eyes. What the hell happened?! His headset display flickered on and read, ""JUG...SPINFUSOR DISC"" as he watched his conqueror slowly ski away on the built-in AfterLife Cam. ""And the asshole was four ranks below me"", Soldier said aloud. Fuck. He watched the countdown on the headset display, and tried to rouse what was left of his spirit. Four, three, two, one.

Soldier jumped off his tower and started skiing with a new fire in his eyes. ""I'm coming for you Jug"". He jetted up a hill and landed on top of
his ship. Through gritted teeth he whispered, ""Now where are you you..."" ""THE SWORDERS HAVE OUR FLAG!"" The booming voice woke Soldier from his revenge-filled muse; ""I swore to defend"" he thought, before shouting on the comms, ""I'll retrieve our flag!"" He may have lost the duel, but this was the time for Soldier to shine! His headset display marked the flag carrier immediately; it was Path, and he was getting away. Fast.

With the scars of battle on his face, and the weight of The Great Eagle that adorned his shoulders, Soldier took off. As he skiied down a nearby hill, he pictured his glorious moment; a well timed Prox into the back of Path and, with his weak armour, he would surely fall. The Holy Flag would, in turn, fall nearby, and Soldier would use his Skin to instantly teleport it back to base. Soldier the hero. As he reached the foot of the hill in front of him, he took a moment to admire the small fish swimming in the shallows. They knew nothing of war, nothing of pain. Maybe one day that could be said of Soldier.

Jetpack engaged, Soldier shot up the hill, and emerged in the glorious sunlight. Two hundred and fifty sanics; ""Now we're shifting"" thought
Soldier. As he looked through the sunlight he was struggling to spot Path, when...""OUR FLAG HAS BEEN CAPTURED!""...Soldier dropped. ""How can I keep up?"" he screamed, ""How can I chase Path with this goddamn Skin??""

There was barely time for Soldier to whisper the Forgiveness Shazbot before he heard it; ""I'm ten seconds out!"" It was Finder. And Soldier was nearly at the enemy base. He may have lost the duel, lost the chase, but he could provide the offensive strike Finder needed to get in and out safely.""This is what Soldier was born to do"".

Soldier steeled himself, and ploughed on forward. He spotted that the lonely Tech to his left was waiting for his Shrike to power up. Boom, 
Thumper to the face! Tech jumped. The rat-a-tat of the Gast only lasted a couple of seconds before Tech slumped to the ground. ""This is what Soldier was born to do."" ""Five seconds!"" said Finder. Soldier threw a Prox up to the shrine holding the enemy Flag On High, before jetting up himself. ""Attack Soldier, this is what you were born to do"". But no sooner than he had the though he felt the ping of a bullet to his Skin.

Soldier gritted his teeth. Then instantly another ping of pain. And another. And another. Soldier looked up;the Flag guardian, Bringer, faced him defiantly. Soldier fired his Thumper, but he knew it was over. Bringer's cannon ripped Soldier to shreds in seconds. Soldier's body lost all feeling and began falling from the sky. With his last ounce of energy, Soldier opened his left eye and saw Finder flying in at great speed. ""Maybe I did enough,"" he thought, ""Maybe we can capture the infidel's Flag. Maybe you were born to do this"". Soldier's eye began to shut, just as Finder's body exploded around a Titan missile.

Four, three, two, one. Soldier awoke again. But this time he just stood there. The comms were raging, but Soldier couldn't even hear them. It
was a stalemate right now, and every man was needed in the fight. But he was not a man. A man can duel. A man can chase. A man can attack. A Soldier can do nothing.

Soldier looked to his right thigh, and reached down to unclip a cover on his Skin. The 'K' button, glowing red, sat there. Then, with the
right hand that had killed hundreds, maybe thousands, lightly touched the 'K' button. He knew the sin he was going to commit; he was going to abandon his comrades, forsaking the oath he had taken to defend the Flag On High. Soldier said aloud,""Reliable. Versatile. Solid...fuck you."" He pressed the button. Everything went dark...

So as Soldier stood there, with his greying hair, scarred face, and broken spirit, he cursed Highers. ""I wish I mattered to you, but I don't. I fight for my honour, and for your profit, but you don't care. You think I want praise? To be called 'Hero'? No. I am not 'Hero'. I am Soldier.""

Regular Reddit Pugs will still be going, but there will be separate channels for the new folks. Zero experience with pugging or comp play is fine, and in fact anyone that has much experience playing pugs or comp will be asked to join the regular pugs. The goal is for first timers to not feel overwhelmed or outclassed.

Comp players will ""coach"" the teams that are formed, going over roles and positions and speccing the games while on mumble to give strategic advice and help make adjustments. We will even have indredd there to cast some of the games so you can go back and watch yourself make plays.

The only thing that is required is a microphone of some sort and a good attitude. Euros are welcome too if you don't mind the hours. Show up anytime from 9PM EST until very late and you will get to experience the fun of organized pug play in a non threatening environment. If it goes well we may have an encore Saturday night.

Join the mumble at

mumble.anreddittribe.net 
port: 36085

And find the ""NewBlood PUG"" section.

I just want to remind everyone why we play pugs, and to be friendly and helpful to the new players in this community. New players are few and far between, yet, we continue to ostracize them and make them feel like pieces of dirt in the PUGs.

The whole idea of a PUG is a bridge to the competitive scene.  It's a place where even experienced players learn, try new things, and sometimes embarrass ourselves in the process.  In this small of a community, you WILL play with a mix of players who are practically legends and others who are just starting out.  

And if the good players come out and want to play a PUG like it's the last game of their lives, it will drive away new players every time. Based on what I've witnessed in these last few weeks, if I was a new player, I wouldn't stick around.  We are too mean and too competitive, even in casual play. And for god's sake don't offend the new players! I was appalled with what I heard in comms today!  

In short, just have fun!  Joke around, hell I've TK'd a few people on purpose just for grins, and then laugh about it. Certainly not often, but enough to remind people to take a break from the seriousness. 

On the other side of things, if you see that the other team threw in a new player, be nice and play off-roles.  Maybe try out hitscan even though you have a great ping.  Snipe when you usually cap.  Play HOF instead of offense.  

TL;DR: PUGs should be enjoyed, not stressed over.  Treat new players well.  And if EVEN ONE new player comes in and throws a kink in things, suck it up, and finish the match.  No moaning and groaning.

Maybe it's common knowledge from other shooters?  I only see it mentioned off-hand.  Most notably the difference between these three events:

Automatic reload:  When you run out of bullets while holding the trigger down.

Active reload: When you press 'r' while there are bullets in the magazine.  The important part here is that, for many automatics, reloading is a two-step animation.  First you swap the magazine, then you advance the shell.  BUT, if you don't run the gun out all the way, there is still one left in the chamber, so you skip the advance-the-shell part of it, meaning your reload is about 40% faster. 

Passive reload:  When a weapon is deselected for more than 3 seconds, it ends up at full ammo (even for shotguns that might take longer than that to load).

Does anyone have a list of the difference between automatic and active reload times?  Obviously for weapons like spinfusors/thumpers it doesn't help, but there might be some surprises.

&gt;We've tested it a lot. I think ultimately it is a personal preference thing, where different people are going to prefer different things and you'll never reach a situation where everyone is happy on this topic. 

&gt;At this point, I think the 50% is working well for a very large percentage of people. Changing at this point across the board would be more disruptive than helpful, most likely annoying as many or more people than it pleased.

&gt;While I think there are a couple targeted areas that could be changed on inheritance, I did not want to set the expectation of a wholesale change to all weapons, and wanted the community to focus on feedback that will be more helpful at this stage.

&gt;The big things we are focusing on for the next few weeks are:

&gt;* 1) Stability and performance
* 2) Fix annoying issues and bugs such as deadstops, etc (including some things that feel bad at higher ping).
* 3) Private servers
* 4) Improved social/friends features
* 5) New and better maps

&gt;Obviously, there will also be a variety of balance tweaks. We also have a group working on new weapons, skins, etc. And we are continually experimenting with new gamemodes.
&gt;
&gt;There is a long roadmap of other things we have planned beyond the next few weeks, but the items above will likely keep us busy for the rest of this month .

Thankfully with the new patch this became twice as easy now that they actually tell you your base xp and so I was able to derive the formula to calculate xp based on the data I collected and the hints given by HiRez.  I present to you what I am 95% sure is the formula to determine your xp for a round:



    Base XP = time_played*0.55
    Bonus XP = (Base XP)*(win_bonus+0.25/rank)


time_played is simply the amount of time you were playing in seconds (not 100% sure whether it takes afk time into account)

win_bonus is 0.25 (25%) if you win the round, 0 if you lose

rank is your rank on the leaderboard for your team (so if you get top of your team you get a 25% bonus, if you get 5th you get a 5% bonus etc).  Note that this has nothing to do with the number of players in the game (so arena is kinda OP for grinding xp).

If you have VIP, you get 50% more total xp (base+bonus) and if you're boosted the total xp is then doubled.  Happy grinding!

**EDIT:** The xp rate may not be a fixed number, harder to calculate due to the way the game likely calculates ""actual"" time playing, so take that number with a grain of salt (but 0.55 is a decent average for TDM games).

Whenever you die you drop all the flags your carrying plus one. You can carry as many flags as you want and you score by returning flags to a central point (the nexus). The twist is that the more flags you return, the more points you get for each flag, so it was always a contest of how greedy you are against what you think your chance of dying is.

After there's a certain number of flags on the ground near each other the game would call it a ""Yard Sale"" and place a marker on everyone's HUDs. This was the best part because then everyone would flock there trying to get flags, which just made MORE flags appear there as they died.

HiRezLauncherUI game=200 product=20

This will allow you to download and play around with a T:A public dev build. It has all sorts of goodies like the dev console being unlocked and new, unreleased maps. A few of the maps (such as bella omega and a few others) don't have lighting and will crash the game on loading. To fix this go to HiRezGames/tribes public dev/TribesGame/CookedPC and delete textures.tfc and lighting.tfc.

To open a map type ""open [mapname]"" in the console. For a list of maps go to tribes public dev/TribesGame/CookedPC/Maps. Example: ""open TrCTF-Katabatic"".

If you want to go into training mode to experiment with classes and weapons, type this into console:
""set TrGame m_bRoamingMap true""

You can also change the properties of projectiles. Example:
""set TrProj_LightSpinfusor Speed 4750""
That will make the Light spin projectile 95 m/s. 50 uu = 1 m.

Here's the Light Spinfusor projecitle's source file showing you all the variables you can tweak: http://pastebin.com/wz1a8MQ7

open TrCTF-CanyonCrusadeRevival

open TrArena-Indoor

open TrCaH-Inferno

1347856405.0,50,self.Tribes,100asd,Let's talk D stacking,66,16,148,http://www.reddit.com/r/Tribes/comments/100asd/lets_talk_d_stacking/,"If my personal experience is representative of a larger trend, which it may not necessarily be, the phenomenon of D stacking is becoming more prevalent -- at least in games among higher ranked players (I am r35).

It seems to me at least a few factors would explain why defending is favoured:

First of all, defending is often easier, and this may well be the most significant reason. This is not de facto the case and in many games defending may well be more difficult, depending on the O:D distribution of the teams but as a general rule the following is true: defenders outnumber attackers and defense becomes many versus few (or, indeed one) whereas offense usually results in the reverse.

When player skill goes up, this becomes even more apparent. A single good player may have overcome the odds significantly more often against less skilled (or lucky) opponents on offense but at higher ranks the spectrum of skill is arguably smaller, as is room for error. This makes it more unforgiving to even try. This is just speculation, of course.

Second of all, the metagame has progressed more toward defenders. TCN and SEN have most recently seen updates, both very D oriented classes. The nitron nerf along with the buff to chasing has reduced the number of PTH cappers, and at least in my experience the frequency of cappers in general. This is both a good and a bad thing: it is bad because games overextend and stagnate and good because previously capping was more of a solo effort whereas now more support and coordination is required of offense for cappers to succeed: to ward off chasers, disrupt sentinels etc.

That may well be the biggest factor at play. Cappers don't bother because they need help they aren't getting. Other offense won't bother without cappers. And the less O there is, the less anyone will want to O as the more outnumbered you are if you do. A vicious cycle of kinds.

The question is, how can be promote the big 'O' to make games more interesting again? For one, a JUG update would provide (at least a temporary) boost. Some love for PTH capping wouldn't go amiss either, unnerfing nitrons for instance. Both of these are, however, up to HiRez and beyond our direct control (bar keeping the pressure on them by voicing our opinions). 

What we, as players, can do beyond that is only to try and consciously fulfill offensive roles more often as well as encourage others into doing so (by the (reasonable) use of VGS for instance). Dying repeatedly to overwhelming odds can be unfun, for sure, but fighting against the odds can also provide for some thrilling fights and is arguably the best way to improve your skill. Let ego or loss aversion not be an obstacle -- there is no shame in dying, only in not giving it your best. 

Any thoughts on the matter and ideas for promoting O are more than welcome.

1346257621.0,53,self.Tribes,z0yfh,Due to request: My ramblings about the infiltrator class,77,24,52,http://www.reddit.com/r/Tribes/comments/z0yfh/due_to_request_my_ramblings_about_the_infiltrator/,"Been a while since i did one of my guides but i recently found [THIS ABOMINATION](http://tribes.wikia.com/wiki/Infiltrator) and it has got my jimmies rustled, time to fire up the old ~~masterb~~ typing hands.

The infiltrator is a love-hate class for me, i love it because of its sheer power and the amount of piss-abouty-ness-ing it can do.

I hate it because:

* Many people assume its something that its not

* Many people get angry because they assume its something that its not

* Many people are playing it to a standard that makes me want to pry out my eyes and throw them at the nearest flag carrier

* Many people overestimate it

* Many people underestimate it

* People (COUGH HiRez COUGH) are still trying to buff many aspects of it that are now bordering on overpowered.

My goal of this post is to give some insight into the infiltrator, maybe not as in-depth as i would want it to be, but covering the basics at the very least.

**First on the agenda: Weaponry and equipment**

**Primary weapons**

The Rhino SMG's: these things, as with all chain weapons, are a beast in the hands of any skilled player. At 10.5 rounds per second and the highest ammo count over similar RoF weapons (desert NJ4 and the tcn's SMG) this weapon is a beast out in the open.

The Stealthfusor: My favourite primary weapon, it handles exactly like a pathfinder's light spinfusor but with ~9% less damage (700 direct instead of 770, 500 for a close splash shot), Still works outdoors but is much more suited to indoor fighting over the SMG's (not that you should be indoors at all, ill get to that later)

The Jackal: **AHAHAHAHAH JACKALBADS**, seriously dont use this weapon, having being smoten by the nerfbat 4 times now, it is still by far the most overpowered weapon and is still banned in comp play due to the fact it can still airburst for self propulsion and can knock cappers off route eZ-modo.

Dear jackalbads, if you like the jackal go and play raider. Educate yourselves in the fact that this weapon is both useless and overpowered at the exact same time.

**Secondary weapons**

SN7 pistol: The two pistols are (in my eyes) the only choice for a secondary, 170 damage per shot with good RoF.

Arctic SN7: +10 damage per shot over the original pistol in return for -2 ammo per clip ~~This weapon is currently bugged and has drastically lowered rate of fire than it should have~~ This weapon has now had its RoF fixed and is now a viable varient over the SN7

Knives: I honestly dont see the point in these but many argue for it in the case of preference. They have lower RoF and clip than the pistol but do 375 damage and 100 splash (very very small splash radius, its negligible and in some cases is a small disadvantage (Such as a pre-shot before a melee on a target or structure such as the light turret, its more of an annoyance than anything else but if you forget about the splash it will kill you if you decloak next to the masses of pubbie generhumpers))

**Belt Items**

Stickies: Happy little adhesives with a nasty kick to them, they do a stupid amount of damage to structures and a nice amount to biological targets, its main use will be found clearing the flag stand in which case the XL stickies are more useful to rid the stand of mines and provides nice knockback to any defenders near it.

Prism mines: Have you ever played jump-rope? yes? Prism mines are like jumprope with a little twist, failing at jumping over the prism-mines green wire results in a stinging 800 damage dealt regardless of your distance from the mine when you trip it. When you plant this mine facing forwards, the mine will deploy two lasers perpendicular to where you were facing when you placed the mine (to the left and right of you) and extend a good distance, this allows you to hide the mine and still cover an entrance or hallway with it.

Smoke grenades: Banned in comp due to a number of reasons, a fully upgraded smoke grenade will cloak you regardless of if you have been damaged or not. Furthermore for 4 seconds while you are cloaked you will not be de-cloaked via any damage dealt to you. Very useful in getting out of unfavourable conditions (an angry mob of D stackers looking at you with bullets is a good example)

**Perks**

**Slot 1**

Close combat: After the (retarded and unneeded) buff to CC's backstab bonus 2 patches ago, CC allows you do deal 1800 as a backstab and 3600+ damage in special circumstances. (More on this later when i go into more detail with meleeing, for now just ignore the 3600 damage bit)

This perk is the bread and butter attack for infiltrators that run LO but opt not to use sticky nades and will instantly kill any light or medium class apart from the following 2 exceptions:

* The target is also running CC and therefore has a 60% damage reduction from melee, you will only deal 720 damage to the target and will not kill any class unless they are already damaged (the exeption to this is when you can deal over 3200 damage as i said before, again more on that later)

* The target is a raider with an active shield pack with about ~60% of his energy available, i don't know which patched changed this but melee's used to bypass shields, this is no longer the case.

Reach: Allows you to more easily return the flag, when running sonic punch to return flags in standoffs you normally opt for one of two perks, one being reach and the other being stealthy.

Stealthy: After its buff 2 patches ago, this perk offers a HUGE advantage when the enemy run jammer raiders and drop jammers. With this perk the jamming effect of raiders and assets will only have 10% of thier normal radius towards you, this allows you to almost get within melee range of the jammer, rendering them basically useless unless you accidentally walk into it.

Looter: as with all classes, Looter+survivalist combo turns ammo nuggets into your one stop shop to get both a boat load of ammo and a nice heal plus 40% energy refill. The main reason i would use looter is when i am using prism mines as it allows you to constantly restock the mines as soon as they are used.

Safety Third: Probably the best choice when used with XL stickies as it turns thier retardedly xbox huge radius into an even more retardedly xbox huge radius, plus the extra initial grenade you get is a bonus. (The reason i prefer looter over SThird for prism mines is that it is much much harder to keep 3 mines up with only one mine per nugget, you will find that you rarely need that 4th mine from SThird after the initial setup)

Bounty Hunter: Easy kills is easy money, easy money means easy strikes, strikes are a fucking cancer of this game, are boring as fuck to use, require zero kill and you should feel bad for even thinking of using them.

Ultra cap I: If you are new to the game and are not confident about energy management then you can use this is you want to, but i reccomend getting survivalist instead which basically makes this perk useless.

**Perk 2**

Sonic ""motherfucking"" punch: With this perk your melees will be followed up by a hadouken that will force the enemy flag carrier to drop the flag (although it tells them that they have dropped the flag, because HiRez listened to the whiners who dont pay attention to anything and complained about nitrons being OP (LOOOOOOOOOOOOOL))

Survivalist: One of the most used perks in the game and for good reason, this perk will allow you to stay cloaked for as long as you could possibly want, provided that there are nuggets for you to pick up and will provide a nice health boost aswell.

Ultra capacitor II: like ultra cap I, but if you are going to unlock this with xp (never with gold, ever ever ever) then PLEASE dont, just get survivalist and master it, it doesnt take long and you will be better off.

Mechanic: This is more of a fun way to annoy and kill tanks than actually being viable. Grab this, grab a repair gun, cloak your way ontop of an enemy tank and deconstruct them while spamming [VGH]. You will be turned into tasty treats if he has a machine gunner but pubbies normally don't have one. (yes this is a silly tactic but beer makes it viable)


**Usage and Melee**

As an inf, you will be on LO constantly, sure you can be LD as an inf but it's wasteful and you might aswell go soldier/HoF.

Now my cloaky companions, this is the part where you must forget everything that you think you know about the inf and his role as LO, because the majority of players (although /r/tribes goers are much more informed than the non /r/tribes goers) think that the infiltrator is this badass indoors guy who is a reskin of the spy from tf2. 

PSA to all people who think the inf is an indoors class, **YOU ARE WRONG, STOP SPREADING THIS BULLSHIT INFORMATION ON WIKIA AND YOUTUBE, plz goback2CoD where camping and using auto-aim is considered skill**

As LO, you exist for one person and one person only. This person is that smug little pathfinder doing laps around the map scoring you points, but he can't do this on his own as he also this suicidal tendency to try and high speed hug as many Soldiers, HoF's, bullets, mines, walls and base turret shots as he can. Imagine that he is one of those high-maintanence lemmings from the hit 19**'s game that have literally no concept of self-preservation and you must do literally everything that you possibly can to ensure he doesn't die.

Perhaps it was the ridiculous llama grabs and gen room camping. Perhaps it was the thousandth brute with his fucking spaz gun and disco balls that did it. All I knew was, 2 hours into my play session, spawning on HoF hell Drydock, one thought became firmly ingrained in my mind. That thought was ""fuck this game.""

Before I knew what was happening, I was halfway across the map, chaingun in hand. An opposition Brute passes by, shooting off a customary hi-five shot heavies always give each other. I reply with a hail of metal. His fall would be the first to mark my mad crusade. 

Next was a Pathfinder. Low on health from route running or from general stupidity, I didn't know nor cared. He too, fell to an endless stream of lead.

I played the game was played like a trance. I stood there resolutely like a stubborn rock, smack dab in the middle of everything. Anything that flew by I would take potshots at. Anyone that stopped to duel I would obliterate. Brutes, Juggernauts, Raiders, no one seemed to have an answer for the impassable wall of bullets they were met with. Eventually I fell to a well aimed mortar, and I took the opportunity to switch my perks to Potential energy and Ultra Capacitor. Hey, overkill is underrated right?

All thoughts of strategy and teamwork was soon completely removed from my mind. All that mattered was the big fucking gun I held in my hand and the endless targets that were present to me. You thought Jackals were OP? Let me show you what I have here... Sure enough, cries of ""fucking noob Doombringer"" and ""Chaingun OP"" soon filled the chat. I chose to remain silent, fancying myself as some sort of karmic justice, bringing peace to all HoFs who were untimely ripped from their flagstands. 

The end result? http://i.imgur.com/3YD1Q.png

Honestly, being the mediocre 5-6th ranking player I am normally, most of these medals I haven't even SEEN before. Sure we lost narrowly, but at that mattered to me was that my poor Doombringer that had to endure mortar after mortar, game after game, finally got a little payback.

Make linked commands, i.e. VFT-VFG. For instance, when i have the flag, and say VFT, and another player replies VFG i see the reply in green, and a green arrow appears above the player who replied, signalling me to whom i should give the flag.  
The same should be done to commands like ""I'll cover you"" , ""I will clear the flagstand"" (definetly should be added). And ""I will go for the flag"" (the player gets marked, so people will be aware of the cappers position and plan accordingly.

[70+ hour, 97% Brute here.](http://i.imgur.com/PWo6V.png)  I've seen a handful of guides and questions about Brutes that I just don't feel did this great class the justice it deserves.  In the hands of a calm, skillful player, the Brute can be the best dueler, and to that end, they can be a generous asset to their team.  The more enemies there are fighting the Brute and being dead, the fewer enemies there are to cap and chase.  The Brutes are a decent compromise of mobility and resilience, and their role is really one of fighting enemy players directly, and helping their teammates indirectly.  Dueling is the focus I will take with this guide, but the Brute can be effective as HoF (Heavy on Flag) as well.  The weapons a Brute carries are heavy and slow, but pack a serious punch.

**Weapons and Abilities**

* Heavy Spinfusor – The classic Spinfusor, but it does a greater amount of damage at the cost of a slower reload.  A whopping 980 for a direct hit will one-shot an unupgraded light armor and light turrets.  700-350 for splash damage can really crush lights and push heavies around.  Being the only primary weapon means that you must be good with it.  It takes practice, but all the Spinfusors are essentially the same projectile-wise, so practice with other classes' Spinfusors will still be useful for the Brute. 

* Automatic Shotgun – Initial secondary hitscan weapon.  It has a great rate of fire and fantastic damage, but it has a very limited range.  50 * 8 damage for a debilitating 400 is most useful at point blank against heavy armor.  Lights and mediums are generally too small and mobile for the Automatic Shotgun to be fully effective, but fast twitch aiming skill can still make this weapon an excellent buffer to finish off a recently disc'd opponent.

* Nova Colt – Xp/Gold cost secondary hitscan weapon.  Good aim will make short work of lights at 190 to 123 damage per hit.  While not as effective as the Shotgun against heavies, the fantastic range of the Nova Colt will give you many more situations to attack the enemy than the Shotgun will, allowing you to whittle heavies and outright kill lights before they would even be in Shotgun range.

* Fractal Grenade – The initial ""disconade"" is basically an area denial tool that spits out approximately 15 lasers that do 410 damage per hit.  Practially useless for dueling, the grenade only begins its onslaught approximately 2 seconds after coming to a stop on the ground.  This grenade's excellent area denial effect really shines on Capture and Hold and while playing HoF.

* ""Light"" Sticky Grenade – Xp/Gold cost sticky grenade.  Direct splash does 1000 damage to a large area all the way down to 350 damage at the edge of effectiveness.  This grenade will not explode until it has touched any surface for approximately two seconds.  It will promptly adhere to that surface including enemy armor.  This is why it is the only useful dueling grenade that is available to the Brute, due to it being the only grenade that is effective mid air.  It takes a lot of practice, but with a lot of skill and a little luck you can actually stick the enemies with the sticky grenade, outright killing light armors, and causing subtantial damage to medium and heavy armor.  As a side bonus, it does large amount of additional damage to base assets and vehicles.

* Energy Pack – Truly, this pack is a must for Brute mobility.  Granting an additional 35 life saving energy, the mobility boost makes you frustratingly resilient against anyone using explosive projectiles.  Unfortuntely it provides no protection from bullet weapons other than to potentially be able to escape more effectively.

* Shield Pack – A difficult pack to master for those used to mobility, this pack can be switched on to absorb damage as energy.  This pack works miracles indoors, and provides some manner of protection against bullet weapons.  This pack still sees a serious drawback in the form of complete sapping of mobility.  Any reasonably mobile enemy (see: all of them) can generally make short work of a layman with the Shield Pack.  However, a wizard with the Shield Pack could be a god of Arena and C&amp;H.

* Potential Energy – Another must for mobility, this perk adds a reasonable amount of energy to your pool as a percentage of damage you take from explosive weapons.  This is the go to dueling perk.  It will help you to remain mobile as you take damage from enemies, and the Shield Pack will even see a boost in effectiveness due to the effect of this perk.

* Survivalist - Thanks for the mention, dilberry!  This perk will less effectively alleviate your energy woes than Potential Energy will, but it more than makes up for that with the serious heal.  At nearly 400 HP and 40 Energy per pickup, a steady stream of bodies begets a steady stream of bodies.

* Super Heavy – Necessary to play as HoF, it has little other use.

* Safety Third – Two grenades just doesn't seem like enough.

* Looter – Solves the same problem Safety Third does by increasing pickups instead of initial number.

* Mobility – The Brute is surprisingly mobile.  The energy pack makes it the most mobile heavy class.  Skiing will get you going at speeds that don't compare to Pathfinders, but you will be moving.  Energy is plentiful enough to bounce through any duel to victory.  Walk speed is pitiful, and should be avoided where ever possible.

**Game Modes**

* Capture the Flag – Arguably the Brute's weakest mode, they contribute to the team effort in a very indirect manner, so much so that some less in tune players may feel inclined to chide the Brute for ""not doing anything for the team,"" but make no mistake, a Brute causing a serious ruckus at the enemy base will be a most welcome distraction for the capper.  The Brute also can be played defensively to great effect as HoF due to the flag stand denial offered by their Disconades.

* Arena – The Brute does well in Arena due to their surprising mobility with the E-Pack and Potential Energy.  Easily absorbing the inevitable damage while dodging most other hits.  The Brute's weapons pack a serious punch to the lighter, mobility preferred armor prevalent in Arena.

* Capture and Hold – Easily the mode where Brutes are most common, they are exceptionally useful here.  The Shield Pack and Shotgun make great use of the indoor inclined environment of Capture and Hold, while the area denial effect of the Disconades are supremely useful for holding points under assault.

**Matchups**

Brutes are pretty effective at dueling almost every class, with a few notable exceptions.  Bullet weapons are generally very difficult to deal with due to the Brutes' large size and pitiful acute mobility.

* Doombringer with Chaingun – This is your Rock Paper Scissors matchup.  At almost any range, the Chaingun will cut you down.  With good aim and luck, you may be able to burn him down with the Nova Colt, but this is difficult, especially with the increasing stress of the hail of bullets whittling 100 damage a pop.  Staying on the ground near cover is your best bet for avoiding the maelstrom, taking the Colt pot shots you can, and taking the Spinfusor shot as it opens.  Prepare to lose against this guy often.  It is certainly not an imbalance issue, it is simply the most effective matchup against the Brute.

* Juggernaught with LMG – See Doombringer with Chaingun

* Technician – Their SMG is generally more difficult to deal with than their Thumper, but a skilled Technician with a Thumper supported by some well placed turrets can make short work of a Brute as well.  Take careful aim to directly hit their turrets with the Heavy Spinfusor to destroy them in one shot if you're not in immediate danger of being Thumpered.  Stay on the ground and behind cover to defeat the SMG.  Bounce outside or hover in the middle of the hallway to avoid the Thumper.

Thanks for reading guys.  Let us please stop claiming the Brute is useless, shall we?  I want to see some more Brutes out there.  Let's fight!

Edit: I added a proof picture.  Now I'm legit!

1362919337.0,52,self.Tribes,1a0s5v,Compact Nitron: Rebalance,62,10,56,http://www.reddit.com/r/Tribes/comments/1a0s5v/compact_nitron_rebalance/,"Right now, the Compact Nitron is pretty much useless. Having one extra Nitron is not worth crippling impulse jumps. Let's first look at what the balance is like now.

####Current Impulse Jumping Balance for Pathfinders

| |Self Damage (HP)|Impulse (units unknown)|Self Impulse Multiple|Self Impulse|Impulse per Health|AOE Radius|""Hitbox""|Amount Carried|
|:-------|:---------------------:|:------------:|:--------------:|:------------:|:--:|:--:|:---:|:--:|
|**Impact Nitron**|300|54,000|1.2|64,800|216|460|42|3
|**Explosive Nitron**|650|110,000|1.2|132,000|203|360|42|3
|**Compact Nitron** |300|30,000|1.2|36,000|**120**|400|42|4
|**Light Spinfusor** |550|85,000|1.2|102,000|185|360|10|29
|**Dueling/ Blinks Spinfusor** |550|85,000|1.2|102,000|185|340|10|29
|**Bolt Launcher**|650|85,000|1.2|102,000|157|360|10|29
|**Light Twinfusor**|380|85,000|.5|42,500|112|360|10|38

The table above shows what most of us have already concluded: Compact Nitrons are terrible for impulse jumps compared to the other options, only the Light Twinfusor is worse. The table below shows how Chasers and Cappers commonly use these options.

####Current Impulse Jumping Meta
|Role| Perk 1 | Perk 2 |Combo|Health Remaining|Total Impulse
|:--:|:------:|:------:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
|Chase|Rage|Not Ego|2x Disc + Impact|50|268,800
|Chase|Rage|Not Ego|2x Explosive|250|264,000
|Chase|Rage|Not Ego|Bolt + 2x Impact|300|231,600
|Chase|Rage|Not Ego|2x Disc|350|204,000
|Chase|Rage|Not Ego|2x Bolt|250|204,000
|Cap|Any|Ego|2x Explosive|56|264,000
|Cap|Any|Ego|Disc + Explosive|120|240,000
|Cap|Any|Ego|Disc + 2x Impact|152|231,600

Listing Compact Nitrons for any of these combinations is futile, because the Impact Nitrons will ALWAYS be better.

To clarify the perks, Rage will eat the health of one disc jump, and Egocentric reduces your self damage by 35%. Rage will also make you 20% lighter, so these impulse values will make you go faster, and Lightweight (50% weight) may also be used. Since I don't know the relationship between these impulse values and speed, I can't take that into account.

I would not bring this whole discussion to the table if I didn't have a suggestion in mind. I propose that nerfing the Compact Nitron's damage appropriately, the item will be useful for impulse jumping and thus viable. However, we also need to consider that by using the Compact Nitron, players gain the advantage of carrying an extra flag dropper. To provide the balance required, I think that the speed gained by using Compact Nitrons in combination with other tools should be still be less than the speed gained from using the Impact or Explosive Nitrons.

I believe that magic number for damage is 225.

With the new damage, the Impulse per Health ration is 160, still considerable worse than either the Impacts or Explosives.

Efficient combinations are listed below.

####Modified Compact Nitron Combos
|Role| Perk 1 | Perk 2 |Combo|Health Remaining|Total Impulse
|:--:|:------:|:------:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
|Chase|Rage|Not Ego|2x Bolt + Compact|25|240,000
|Chase|Rage|Not Ego|2x Disc + Compact|125|240,000
|Chase|Rage|Not Ego|Bolt/Disc + 3x Compact|225|210,000
|Cap|Any|Ego|2x Disc + Compact|40|240,000
|Cap|Any|Ego|Disc + 3x Compact|105|210,000
|Cap|Any|Ego|4x Compact|316|144,000
|Cap|Safety Third|Ego|5x Compact|170|180,000

This table makes it seem that running the modified Compact Nitron would be viable, but not preferable, as a Chaser or a Capper. This is exactly the balance I sought to find.

**Why 225?**

If the Compact Nitrons dealt 200, then with Egocentric a capper could detonate a disc and then 4 Compact Nitrons, bringing him to speeds greater than what 2 Explosive Nitrons can acheive. This would be overpowered, and is thus avoided.

If the Compact Nitrons dealt 250 damage, a chaser would still die if he Bolted and then Compact Nitronned himself after Rage ended. With 225 damage, he doesn't die, but is extremely fragile, just like with the Disc + Impact Nitron combo. The Disc + Impact combo would still achieve greater speeds with slightly greater health, balancing out the killing power the Bolt Launcher affords.

**Why even make a change?**

Yes, I understand that not all items are meant for comp. The Brute's Gladiator or the Sentinel's BXT1-A come to mind. However, I think that we should look to maximize our options to expand our meta. Too often we find ourselves playing the with the same 'best' loadouts. Developing a meta that fluctuates widely between strategies should be on the forefront of every developer's mind. For example, on the Doombringer, the Mine vs Frag/Defective Frag balance is absolutely horrible. Given the chance, every HOF will run mines. All of the items in this game need to be balanced to the point where it's difficult to distinguish which is better. A beautiful example is the Thumper DX vs Spare Spinfusor balance. Both are very powerful and have appropriate advantages situtionally. We as the fan base need to work with Hi-Rez to acheive this balance throughout the game.
